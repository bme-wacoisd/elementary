**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 4


**Introduction**

Welcome to the Grade 4 Course Guide. This guide is designed to give Grade 4 teachers specific knowledge
about the structure of the instructional materials to help them effectively transition into the program.
Included in this guide is information about standards, assessment tools, the focus of each module, and ways
for families to support students at home. This guide also provides information about how to tailor the culture
of learning to the developmental needs of students, including a background on developmental advances
that affect how students learn in Grade 4 and practical strategies for troubleshooting misconceptions
collaboratively with students.


**Profile of a Grade 4 Math Learner**

Grades 2 through 4 cover a period when students’ math abilities are rapidly changing, growing, and starting to
come together. Their motor skills, estimation abilities, abstract reasoning, self-regulation, and peer interaction
skills need to be coordinated for them to be successful with the instructional materials. Often, this means that
students may become confused or solve problems incorrectly because one or more of the requisite skills are
still developing. For example, students with developing motor skills may have difficulty with manipulating tiles
during activities that teach arrays.

Students at these grade levels are also at the very beginning of developing their abstract reasoning abilities.
For this reason, students can find it challenging to reason about inequalities with different units (e.g., that
10 cm is smaller than 5 m, despite 10 being a larger whole number than 5) or inequalities with different place
values (e.g., that 900 is less than 1,100, even though 9 is greater than 1). Students’ concrete and rule-based
reasoning can also make it more challenging for them to grasp key principles in arithmetic (e.g., that 3 × 6 is
the same as 6 × 3).

In grades 2 through 4, many students are still developing into fluent readers, which might cause them to focus
on certain terms in a word problem and ignore the rest of the context (e.g., they look for the word _total_ and
then add the numbers in the problem). In addition, students’ self-control is still developing. This might cause
students to rush to solve problems and write down the first answer they think of.

These emerging skills need to be coordinated to solve math problems correctly. As a result, teachers of
students in this age range play an important role in helping young math learners learn the math content
and in laying a foundation for number sense, arithmetic, problem solving, and more. This work will prepare
students for more complex and representational math later in the instructional materials. This means that
teachers need to look at the underlying reasons why a student might have gotten a problem wrong—whether
it is an abstract reasoning skill, a literacy skill, or an impulsivity issue—and tailor instruction appropriately.

The modules in the _Bluebonnet Learning_ _K–5 Math_ instructional materials are designed to effectively help
teachers analyze students’ work and provide the instructional support that best meets students’ needs.
The activities support students’ developmental needs by identifying student misconceptions and providing
guidance to address these misconceptions. This ensures that students can move away from an algorithmic,
rule-based version of math—which can often lead them astray as the concepts become more complex—
toward a more holistic competence with mathematical reasoning. For example, teachers are encouraged to
have students work in small groups on problems and explain their reasoning to one another. This approach
allows teachers and students to identify and correct misconceptions as they arise.

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 4


For students to benefit from the _Bluebonnet Learning_ _K–5 Math_ instructional materials approach, they need
to be provided with opportunities to engage in productive struggle. This means that students boldly and
confidently learn to confront mistakes, reframe them into learning opportunities, and then move forward,
deepening their mathematical reasoning throughout the year. One of the best ways to encourage students
to embrace productive struggle is to promote a classroom culture of learning. A culture of learning is one
in which students embrace the process of productive struggle. It is also a culture free from the common
idea that “fast at math = good at math.” By creating a culture of learning and encouraging students to view
challenges as an expected and even desirable part of the learning process, teachers can help students avoid
a fear of math that could undermine the mathematical future of many students. Instead, students can start
enjoying and feeling confident in math even if their answers do not always come quickly.


**Culture of Learning in Grade 4**

As noted in the Program and Implementation Guide, the way to engage math learners and help them embrace
the productive struggle that’s needed to learn deeply is to create a culture of learning. [1] As shown in the figure
below, a culture of learning rests on a foundation of (1) high-quality instructional materials, (2) a teacher’s
intentions, and (3) the language that communicates the intent of teachers and materials.

A culture of learning can be created beginning on the first day of Module 1. A teacher can use language that
communicates their intent for all students to be supported as they are held to a high standard for learning. [2]

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 4


A culture of learning can also be maintained throughout the year since teachers will continue to support
math learners as they embrace challenge. For example, teachers can use language that clarifies their intent of
assigning the rigorous challenges students will face in the instructional materials.

A challenge for teachers is that it can take longer to use language that supports a culture of learning _._ However,
using language that communicates a culture of learning supports students’ developmental needs and learning.
In contrast, language that communicates a culture of compliance can undermine students’ motivation
and engagement because it doesn’t fit with their developmentally appropriate desire for autonomy and
understanding. [3]










|Teacher Behavior|Language that<br>Communicates a Culture<br>of Compliance|Language that<br>Communicates a Culture<br>of Learning|
|---|---|---|
|Introduce the next activity in the<br>lesson plan.|Do this next. You’ll get a bad<br>grade if you don’t.|This next activity will help you<br>understand the material better<br>because ______.|
|Give students a set of problems that<br>they aren’t supposed to finish perfectly<br>in the allotted time (e.g. Sprint).|Just do your best.|Most of you won’t answer all<br>these problems and you might<br>not get them all correct. That’s<br>okay. I’m trying to challenge<br>you so that I can learn what<br>you’re prepared to do and<br>what I need to teach you next.|
|Ask students to explain their thinking<br>on a problem answered incorrectly.|Tell me why you got this wrong.|I’d like you to explain your<br>thinking about this answer.<br>It will help me know how<br>to explain the concept in a way<br>that will be more helpful to<br>you. There is a good chance<br>that somebody else made the<br>same mistake, so your thinking<br>can help the whole class learn.|



The language in the second column promotes a culture of compliance. Students in grades 2 through 5 are
likely to perceive this as disrespecting their need for autonomy and independent thinking.

The language in the third column promotes a culture of learning because it supports students’ autonomy. It
implies that students can own their thinking and that they deserve valid explanations. This approach can help
students feel respected and cause them to be more motivated and engaged.

**Collaboratively Troubleshooting Student Misconceptions**

It is common for students to make mistakes as they build their understanding of new or difficult concepts.
From a student perspective, mistakes can logically occur whenever students try to apply previous learning to
new problems that require a different approach. To help students correct their thinking and develop a better
understanding, teachers can identify the knowledge that students are building on when they make a mistake.

The _Bluebonnet Learning_ _K–5 Math_ instructional materials list common student mistakes for each module.
Teachers can use this information to troubleshoot mistakes collaboratively with students.

As noted in the Program and Implementation Guide, _collaborative troubleshooting_ is a routine to help
teachers address students’ misconceptions. The three steps to collaborative troubleshooting are


(1) surface student thinking;

(2) validate what the student did right; and

(3) bridge to a better understanding.


In Step 1, it’s helpful to ask questions to better understand what the student was thinking when they made a
decision. For example, the teacher can ask, “Can you tell me more about your thinking on this problem?”
or “I noticed you wrote ____. What were some of your reasons for doing that?”

In Step 2, it’s helpful to point out the parts of the problem that the student understood or did correctly. That
way, the student maintains their successful thinking as they retry a problem. For example, teachers can say
“I noticed you did ____ and wrote ____, and that’s great because that means you understood ____.”

Last, in Step 3, the teacher can build on the student’s assets and bridge to a better understanding. It can help
to ask guided questions that invite the student to build a stronger understanding. For example, the teacher
can ask the following questions:


⬛
“If you keep ____ [correct thinking] and changed ____ [misconception] to ____ [alternative], then
what do you think might happen?”


⬛
“What would happen if you did ____ instead of ____?”


⬛
“If ____ [correct thinking] is true, then how does that thinking affect ____ [misconception]?”


In practice, this routine may look and sound like the following teacher–student dialogue, which is based on a
misconception for Grade 4 Module 1 Topic F that is listed in the Module Overview.

_Note: Teachers can adapt this sample dialogue to other misconceptions listed in the Module Overview._

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 4


**Scenario** : A student makes an error on a multi-step word problem involving addition and subtraction, such as
with the following example.

In one year, a factory used 11,650 meters of cotton. They used 4,950 fewer meters of silk than cotton and
3,500 fewer meters of wool than silk. How many meters in all were used of the three fabrics?

The student believes that the question “How many meters in all?” means the three numbers shown in the
problem should be added together without considering what each number represents. The teacher has a oneon-one discussion with the student.


**Step 1: Surface student thinking.**

T: Why did you decide to add 11,650, 4,950, and 3,500?
S: The question is asking “How many meters in all?” So, I added the three numbers to find the total.


**Step 2: Validate what the student did right.**

T: Yes, the problem is asking you to find the total meters of fabric used. Let’s read the information given
in the problem about each number again.
S: A factory used 11,650 meters of cotton. They used 4,950 fewer meters of silk than cotton and 3,500
fewer meters of wool than silk.


**Step 3: Bridge to a better understanding.**

T: What do you notice about the numbers? Do we know the length of each type of fabric?
S: The length of cotton is 11,650 meters. The amounts of the other fabrics are based on the amounts of
cotton. We don’t know the length of silk or wool.
T: Let’s draw a strip diagram to represent the length of each type of fabric. First, read what the problem
says about cotton. How can you represent that in a strip diagram?
S: I can draw a strip for cotton and label it 11,650. (Draw.)
T: Read what the problem says about the amount of silk. How can you represent that in the strip
diagram? How does it compare to cotton?
S: I can draw a shorter strip for silk and label the difference between cotton and silk as 4,950. (Draw.)
T: Read what the problem says about the amount of wool. How can you represent that in the strip
diagram? How does it compare to the other parts of the diagram?
S: I can draw a strip for wool that is shorter than the silk strip and label the difference between silk and
wool as 3,500. (Draw.)
T: What does the strip diagram show you about how to find the amount of silk used?
S: I can subtract 4,950 from 11,650 to find the amount of silk used.
T: What does the strip diagram show you about how to find the amount of wool used?
S: I can subtract 3,500 from the amount of silk used.
S: (Subtracts and labels the strip diagram with the amounts of silk and wool used.)
T: How will you find how many meters of fabric used in all?
S: Now I know the amounts of silk and wool used. I can add the amounts of all three fabrics to find the
total.

**Assessment Reflection Tool**

An assessment reflection can be powerful in helping to surface student thinking and in helping students to
monitor and track their own growth. It can also help students anticipate and process any thoughts they may
have about completing an assessment.

The Assessment Reflection Tool can help teachers guide discussions both prior to and after an assessment.
These discussions help the teacher promote a culture of productive struggle as students go into testing. These
discussions also support students’ needs after testing and give students the opportunity to reflect on their
progress and learn from their mistakes after an assessment.

**Summary of Year**

Grade 4 mathematics is about (1) developing understanding and fluency with multi-digit multiplication,
and developing understanding of dividing to find quotients involving multi-digit dividends; (2) developing
an understanding of fraction equivalence, addition and subtraction of fractions with like denominators; and
(3) understanding that geometric figures can be analyzed and classified based on their properties, such as
having parallel sides, perpendicular line segments, particular angle measures, and symmetry.


**Rationale for Module Sequence in Grade 4**

In Grade 4, students extend their work with whole numbers. They begin with large numbers using familiar units
(hundreds and thousands) and develop their understanding of billions by building knowledge of the pattern of
_times ten_ in the base-ten system on the place value chart. In Grades 2 and 3, students focused on developing the
concept of composing and decomposing place value units within the addition and subtraction algorithms. Now,
in Grade 4, those compositions and decompositions are seen through the lens of multiplicative comparison (e.g.,
1 thousand is 10 times as much as 1 hundred). Students next apply their broadened understanding of patterns
on the place value chart to compare, round, add, and subtract. The addition and subtraction algorithms then
become efficient and useful applications of students’ knowledge of and skill with composing and decomposing
higher value units. The module culminates with solving multi-step word problems involving addition and
subtraction modeled with strip diagrams that focus on numerical relationships.

The addition and subtraction algorithms continue to play a part in Module 2 as students relate place value
units to metric units. This module helps students draw similarities between the following:


1 ten = 10 ones
1 hundred = 10 tens


1 hundred = 100 ones
1 meter = 100 centimeters


1 thousand = 1,000 ones
1 kilometer = 1,000 meters
1 kilogram = 1,000 grams
1 liter = 1,000 milliliters


**12**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 4


Students work with metric measurement as a context for using the addition and subtraction algorithms,
mental math, place value, and word problems. (Customary units are used as a context for fractions in
Modules 5 and 7.) Students extend their knowledge from Grade 3 to use input–output tables and numerical
expressions to represent number patterns and the relationship between the position of a number in a pattern
and the value of that number.

In Module 3, measurement of perimeter and area provide the concrete foundation behind the distributive
property in the multiplication algorithm. For example, 4 × (1 m 2 cm) can be modeled concretely using ribbon,
since students can see the 4 copies of 1 meter and the 4 copies of 2 centimeters. Likewise, 4 × (1 ten 2 ones)
= 4 tens 8 ones. Next, students use place value disks to develop efficient procedures and models that lead
to using the algorithms for multiplying by one-digit whole numbers. They understand and explain why the
procedures work, and they make connections between the area model and work on the place value chart.
Building on their knowledge of division types ( _group size unknown_ and _number of groups unknown_ ), students
represent division with arrays and the area model, before practicing with place value disks and then the
standard division algorithm. Interpreting remainders, both in word problems and long division, is a focus of
this work. Finally, two-digit by two-digit multiplication is modeled using the area model, extending students’
earlier experiences with measurement and the distributive property. Throughout the module, students also
solve word problems where they select and accurately apply appropriate methods to estimate, mentally
calculate, or use written strategies to compute products and quotients.

Module 4 focuses on solving unknown angle measure problems using equations with letters standing for unknowns
and on constructing, analyzing, classifying two-dimensional figures, and recognizing and drawing lines of symmetry.
From their work in earlier grades, students have already used letters and equations to solve word problems. They
continue to do so in Grade 4, and now they also learn to solve unknown angle problems, work that challenges
students to build and solve equations to find unknown angle measures. First, students learn the definition of _degree_
and learn how to measure angles in degrees using a circular protractor. From the definition of _degree_ and the fact
that angle measures are additive, the following rudimentary facts about angles naturally follow:


1. The sum of angle measurements around a point is 360 degrees.
2. The sum of angle measurements on a line is 180 degrees.


Hence, from 1 and 2, students see that vertical angles have equal measure. Armed only with these facts,
students are able to generate and solve equations as in the following problem:


Find the unknown angle _x_ .


_x_ + 240 + 90 = 360

_x_ + 330 = 360





_x_ = 30

The unknown angle is 30 degrees.



|x°|Col2|
|---|---|
|_x_°<br>||


Unknown angle problems help to unlock algebraic concepts for students because such problems are visual _._
The 𝑥 stands for a specific number. A student could use a protractor to find (determine) the angle measure 𝑥 .
But doing so may destroy the joy of deducing the answer and solving the puzzle on their own.

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 4


Module 5 centers on equivalent fractions and operations with fractions. Students can use fractions when
there is a given unit, the _whole unit_, but they need to learn to measure using a smaller unit, called the
_fractional unit_ . Previous modules earlier in the year prepared students to explore the relationship between a
fractional unit and its whole unit by carefully establishing examples of such relationships in different contexts.


360 degrees in 1 complete turn

100 centimeters in 1 meter

1,000 grams in 1 kilogram

1,000 milliliters in 1 liter


The beauty of fractional units, once defined and understood, is that they behave just as all other units do:


⬛
“3 fourths + 5 fourths = 8 fourths” just as “3 meters + 5 meters = 8 meters”


⬛
“6 eighths – 1 eighth = 5 eighths” just as “6 tens – 1 ten = 5 tens”



Students use multiplication and division to find equivalent fractions and justify their work using area
models and strip diagrams. They compare fractions with unlike denominators by using a known benchmark

(e.g., 0, [1]
2 [, or 1) or by using like numerators or like denominators, and reason that comparing fractions can be ]

done only when referring to the same whole. Students add and subtract fractions with like units, including
fractions greater than 1 and mixed numbers, using visual models such as the area model and the number line.
Through this introduction to fraction arithmetic, they gradually come to understand fractions as units they
can manipulate, just like whole numbers. Customary units of measurement provide a relevant context for the
arithmetic throughout the module.



Module 6, on decimals, starts with students realizing that decimal place value units are simply special



1 1
fractional units with denominators of 10 or 100 (e.g., 1 tenth =, 1 hundredth = ), and that the place
10 100



value system is symmetric about the ones column. Fluency activities throughout the module continue to



emphasize the connection between decimals and fractions as students learn to relate [3] = 0.3 = 3 tenths.
10



Students also recognize that 3 tenths is equal to 30 hundredths and subsequently have their first experience
adding and subtracting fractions with unlike units (e.g., 3 tenths + 4 hundredths = 30 hundredths + 4
hundredths). They solve word problems involving money in both fraction and decimal form. Then students
move to the study of personal financial literacy, investigating different types of financial institutions, exploring
fixed and variable expenses, and solving word problems that calculate profits.



The year ends with Module 7, focused on measurement with multiplication and data analysis, as students
solve multi-step word problems. Exploratory lessons support students’ conceptual understanding of the
relative sizes of customary measurement units. Students explore conversion in hands-on settings and
subsequently apply those conversions to solve multi-step word problems involving all operations. Finally,
students collect data with measurements in fractions and decimals and represent this data on frequency
tables, dot plots, and stem-and-leaf plots.

**Grade 4 Development of Fluency**
**Overview**

Fluency activities are designed to promote automaticity and flexibility by engaging students in ways that build
fluency from conceptual understanding. The fluency activities in each lesson provide students with strategic
learning opportunities to develop their proficiency with specific TEKS. While all TEKS are included in the
instructional materials, some TEKS may not be practiced in a fluency activity.
**Fluency Year-at-a-Glance**

For specific TEKS descriptions and student expectations, refer to the relevant Fluency Close-Up tables.

###### **Tips for Families**

**Key Concepts Overview**

Focus TEKS: **4.2A, 4.2B, 4.2C, 4.2D, 4.4A, 4.4G, 4.5A**

The focus of Module 1 is developing place value understanding of numbers up to 1 billion and applying that
understanding to round, compare, and order numbers and to add and subtract multi-digit numbers. Your
student will:

⬜ Develop knowledge of larger place values by focusing on the _times ten_ pattern on the place value chart.

⬜ Read numbers up to 1 **billion** and represent numbers in standard form, unit form, word form, and in
expanded notation.

⬜ Compare and order whole numbers.

⬜ Round numbers through the **hundred thousands** place using the vertical number line.

⬜ Estimate solutions by using rounding and compatible numbers to decide whether their answers are
reasonable.

⬜ Represent word problems using a strip diagram and a **letter** to represent an unknown quantity as
they work toward becoming fluent with the standard algorithm for addition and subtraction.

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages
in the Succeed Student Edition to help you support your student as they work at home.

**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Support your student as he draws and labels a place value chart (up to billions). Ask him to say a large
number (up to 1 billion). Represent the number on the place value chart using cereal pieces to represent each place value. Challenge each other to say the name of the number that was created using
word form, unit form, and expanded notation.


⬛
Play the “Build a Number” game with your student. The objective of the game is to build a larger number than your opponent’s number on a place value chart. Players take turns rolling a die and then must
choose into which place value to write the digit that was rolled. (Variation: Build a smaller number.)
Be sure to talk to your student about strategy. For example, ask your student where she would write
the digit if she rolled the number 6 and the objective was to build the largest possible number. Listen
for her to say that she would write the digit in the empty space with the largest place value (i.e.,
hundred thousands or the next largest place value if hundred thousands is already taken).


⬛
Write a 6-digit number on a piece of paper. Ask your student to round the number to the nearest
hundred, nearest thousand, nearest ten thousand, and nearest hundred thousand.


⬛
Ask your student to restate each word problem in his own words. Make sure he understands each
problem before he begins to draw his strip diagram. After your student draws the strip diagram, and
before he attempts to solve the problem, ask him to explain the strip diagram to you.

**Formas Adicionales De Ayudar En Casa**


⬛
Apoye a su estudiante mientras dibuja y etiqueta una tabla de valor posicional (hasta miles de millones). Pídale que diga un número grande (hasta mil millones). Represente el número en la tabla de
valor posicional utilizando piezas de cereal para representar cada valor posicional. Desafíense mutuamente a decir el nombre del número que se creó usando la forma de la palabra, la forma de la unidad
y la notación desarrollada.


⬛
Juegue a “Construir un número” con su estudiante. El objetivo del juego es construir un número más
grande que el número de su oponente en una tabla de valor posicional. Los jugadores se turnan para
tirar un dado y luego deben elegir en qué valor posicional escribir el dígito que se tiró. (Variación:
construir un número más pequeño).
Asegúrese de hablar con su estudiante sobre la estrategia. Por ejemplo, pregunte a su estudiante
dónde escribiría el dígito si sacara el número 6 y el objetivo fuera construir el número más grande
posible. Escúchelo para que diga que escribiría el dígito en el espacio vacío con el valor posicional


**38**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 4

Module 2 focuses on length, mass, and capacity in the metric system, converting units, and applying unit
conversions to solve and reason about multi-step word problems. Additionally, students use input–output
tables to represent the relationship between the input values and output values with numerical expressions.
Your student will:

⬜ **Convert** from larger units to smaller units (find equivalent measures).

⬜ Add and subtract amounts expressed in **mixed units** using a simplifying strategy or algorithm.

⬜ Compare metric units and plot and label measurements on a number line.

⬜ Solve word problems involving length, **mass**, and capacity using strip diagrams.

⬜ Identify relationships in number patterns and represent them in input–output tables.

⬜ Apply their knowledge of input–output tables to solve word problems.

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages

**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Pose questions such as, “Would we measure the distance from here to the store with centimeters,
meters, or kilometers?”, “Would we measure a person’s mass in grams or kilograms?”, or “Would we
measure the capacity of a coffee cup in milliliters or liters?” Ask your student to justify his answers.


⬛
Practice metric conversions from a larger unit to a smaller unit. Use the units kilometer, meter, millimeter, kilogram, gram, milligram, kiloliter, liter, and milliliter (e.g., 2 kg = ___ g). Make a game with
index cards, sticky notes, or small pieces of paper. Write one measurement on each card (e.g., write
“2 kg” on one card and “2,000 g” on another card). Use the cards to play a variation of Go Fish or a
memory game. The objective is to make matches of equivalent measures.


⬛
Together with your student, look through your kitchen cupboards. Take out several cans of food.
Look at the labels to see if you can find any metric units, such as grams, that are comparable. Use the
measurements to line the cans up from least to greatest. Draw a number line and then plot and label
the measurements.


⬛
Play the “Build an Input–Output Table” activity with your student. The activity allows her to practice
applying a rule to an input number to find its corresponding output number, or vice versa. For example,
given the input numbers of 0, 1, 4, and 10 and the rule of add 2 to the input, she has to find the output
numbers. Use rules involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, and have your student
explain how she gets the output numbers. (Be careful not to use subtraction rules resulting in negative
numbers or division rules resulting in fractions. Students are not familiar with either concept.)

**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
With your student, identify rectangular shapes (e.g., window, door, top of table, top of dresser,
cookie sheet, place mat, rug). Ask him to use a tape measure or a ruler to measure the length and
the width of each rectangle to the nearest inch. Then have him find the area and perimeter of each
rectangle. Keep in mind that he might need to use a calculator if the numbers are large.


⬛
Create a game to practice multiplication facts with your student. Each of you will need ten index
cards or small pieces of paper. Number the cards so each of you has one card for each digit (0–9).
Place the cards face down in a pile. One player picks up two cards. The other player has to multiply
the numbers shown on the two cards. Switch roles. See how many problems you can complete in one
minute.

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 4


⬛
Write five multiplication expressions of a one-digit number times a two-, three-, or four-digit number.
Before your student solves each expression, prompt her to roll a die or use a random number generator on a smartphone to determine which method to use: 1 means using a standard algorithm,
2 means using partial products, 3 means using an area model, 4 means she can choose the method,
5 means you have to solve, 6 means she can use a calculator.


⬛
Ask your student to draw and label a place value chart. Create a four-digit number on the chart, using
cereal or raisins for disks. Ask him to use his “disks” to demonstrate how to divide the number by 2,
3, or 4.

⬛
Con su estudiante, identifique formas rectangulares (por ejemplo, ventana, puerta, parte superior de
una mesa, parte superior de un tocador, bandeja para galletas, tapete, alfombra). Pídale que use una
cinta métrica o un metro para medir la longitud y el ancho de cada rectángulo hasta la pulgada más
cercana. Luego, pídale que encuentre el área y el perímetro de cada rectángulo. Tenga en cuenta que
podría necesitar usar una calculadora si los números son grandes.

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 4


⬛
Cree un juego para practicar las tablas de multiplicar con su estudiante. Cada uno de ustedes necesitará diez fichas o pequeños trozos de papel. Numere las tarjetas para que cada uno tenga una tarjeta
para cada dígito (0–9). Coloque las cartas boca abajo en una pila. Un jugador debe recoger dos
cartas. El otro jugador tiene que multiplicar los números que se muestran en las dos cartas. Cambien
los roles. Vea cuántos problemas puede completar en un minuto.


⬛
Escriba cinco expresiones de multiplicación de un número de un dígito por un número de dos, tres o
cuatro dígitos. Antes de que su estudiante resuelva cada expresión, pídale que tire un dado o use un
generador de números aleatorios en un smartphone para determinar qué método usar: 1 significa
usar un algoritmo estandarizado, 2 significa usar productos parciales, 3 significa usar un modelo de
área, 4 significa que puede elegir el método, 5 significa que usted tiene que resolver, 6 significa que
el estudiante puede usar una calculadora.


⬛
Pida a su estudiante que dibuje y etiquete una tabla de valor posicional. Cree un número de
cuatro dígitos en la tabla, usando cereales o pasas para los discos. Pídale que use sus “discos” para
demostrar cómo dividir el número entre 2, 3 o 4.


**Términos**

_Propiedad asociativa_ **de multiplicación** : el proceso de agrupar factores de diferentes maneras no cambia el
producto.

The focus of Module 4 is introducing points, lines, line segments, rays, and angles, as well as the relationships
between them, and then applying that new understanding to classify figures and solve problems. Your student will:

⬜ Identify and draw **points**, **lines**, **line segments**, **rays**, **angles**, **perpendicular** lines, and **parallel** lines.

⬜ Determine whether an angle is an **acute angle**, a **right angle**, or an **obtuse angle** .

⬜ Use **protractors** to measure and construct angles and record the measurements in **degrees** .

⬜ Interpret and explore quarter (90°) turns.

⬜ Compose angles of different measures by using pattern blocks.

⬜ Determine unknown angle measurements mathematically and then use a protractor to verify the
measurements.

⬜ Find and draw **lines of symmetry** .

⬜ Identify, classify, and draw **acute**, **right**, and **obtuse** **triangles** .

⬜ Name quadrilaterals, identify attributes (i.e., characteristics) that define them, and construct them
based on given attributes.

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages
in the Succeed Student Edition to help you support your student as they work at home.

**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
With your student, look around for acute, right, and obtuse angles and for perpendicular and parallel
lines. You’ll likely discover that right angles, perpendicular lines, and parallel lines are the simplest to
find! You might find acute and obtuse angles on clocks, on the molding around windows and doors,
on windows that crank open, and on hinged picture frames, among other places.


⬛
Using a straightedge, such as a ruler, take turns with your student drawing angles on a piece of paper.
Make a game of it. After drawing an angle, you and he both guess how many degrees the angle
measures. Measure the angle with a protractor to see whose guess was closer.


⬛
Practice with your student making quarter-turns with your bodies. Stand and face the same wall.
Next, close your eyes. Take turns giving a directive to turn 90°, 180°, 270°, or 360° to the right or left.
After each turn, open your eyes to see whether you are both facing the same wall. If you are not,
discuss who is facing the correct direction.


⬛
Prompt your student to lay two pieces of uncooked spaghetti on a piece of paper so they intersect at
their midpoints. (She may want to tape the pieces down so they don’t move.) Next, direct her to use
a protractor to measure any one of the angles. Finally, ask her to determine the measure of the other
three angles mathematically.

⬛
Con su estudiante, miren a su alrededor en busca de ángulos agudos, rectos y obtusos y de líneas
perpendiculares y paralelas. ¡Es probable que descubran que los ángulos rectos, las líneas perpendiculares y las líneas paralelas son las más fáciles de encontrar! Puede encontrar ángulos agudos y
obtusos en los relojes, en las molduras alrededor de las ventanas y puertas, en las ventanas que se
abren con una manivela y en los marcos de cuadros con bisagras, entre otros lugares.


⬛
Usando una herramienta de medición, como un metro, tome turnos con su estudiante dibujando
ángulos en un pedazo de papel. Haga un juego de eso. Después de dibujar un ángulo, usted y él

Grade 4 Module 7
###### **Tips for Families**

**Key Concepts Overview**

Focus TEKS: **4.4H, 4.5A, 4.5B, 4.8A, 4.8B, 4.8C, 4.9A, 4.9B**

The focus of Module 7 is exploring measurement (including metric units and customary units) and data,
applying multiplication to convert measurement units, and problem solving with measurement. Your
student will:

⬜ Convert larger units of length, weight, mass, liquid volume, capacity, and time to smaller units of
length, weight, mass, liquid volume, capacity, and time, or vice versa.

⬜ Add and subtract mixed measurement units.

⬜ Convert larger mixed measurement units with fractional parts to smaller units.

⬜ Use the Read–Draw–Write process to solve word problems, including multi-step measurement word
problems.

⬜ Use a measurement data set to create frequency tables and dot plots and interpret the data.

⬜ Create a **stem-and-leaf plot** and interpret the data.

⬜ Use data and graphical representations to solve problems.

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages
in the Succeed Student Edition to help you support your student as they work at home.


**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Find packages, cartons, cans, or boxes in your kitchen that have labels that show weights or capacities. With your student, convert the measurements to smaller units or larger units. For example, your
milk container might have a capacity of 2 quarts. Convert to find out how many cups that is.
(2 quarts = 8 cups) Find real-world situations throughout the day that will help her think about
conversions. For example, ask her whether she would have enough milk for a soup recipe requiring
9 cups if she had a 2-quart container full of milk. (No; 2 quarts is only 8 cups.)


⬛
Find a tape measure that measures distances greater than 1 yard and show it to your student. Pull
out the tape and ask him to examine the measurements. Are they metric units (i.e., centimeters)
or standard units (i.e., inches)? How can he tell? Next, ask him to use the tape measure to prove
the equivalence of measurements. For example, you might ask him to prove that 1 foot 3 inches is
equivalent to 15 inches.


⬛
With your student, use index cards or small pieces of paper to make eight pairs of cards that
show equivalent measurements. For example, on one card, write pounds; on another card, write
52 ounces. Use measures of length, weight, capacity, and time. After you have made the cards, play a
memory game with your student to match the equivalent measurements.

⬛
Have your student measure several similar objects and record the measurements. Then have him
display the data by using a dot plot and/or a stem-and-leaf plot. Your student can create a question
that can be answered by using the data. For example, if he measures the heights of several pieces of
furniture, a possible question is, “What is the difference in height between the tallest and shortest
pieces of furniture that were measured?”

Enfoque de TEKS: **4.4H, 4.5A, 4.5B, 4.8A, 4.8B, 4.8C, 4.9A, 4.9B**

El enfoque del Módulo 7 es explorar la medición (incluyendo las unidades métricas y las unidades
tradicionales) y los datos, aplicar la multiplicación para convertir las unidades de medición y resolver
problemas con la medición. Su estudiante:

⬜ Convertirá unidades más grandes de longitud, peso, masa, volumen de líquido, capacidad y tiempo en
unidades más pequeñas de longitud, peso, masa, volumen de líquido, capacidad y tiempo, o viceversa.

⬜ Sumará y restará unidades de medida mixtas.

⬜ Convertirá unidades de medición mixtas más grandes con partes fraccionarias en unidades más
pequeñas.­

⬜ Usará el proceso de lectura-dibujo-escritura para resolver problemas de palabras, incluyendo los
problemas de palabras de medición de varios pasos.

⬜ Usará un conjunto de datos de medición para crear tablas de frecuencias y diagramas de puntos e
interpretar los datos.

⬜ Creará un **diagrama de tallo y hojas** e interpretar los datos.

⬜ Usará datos y representaciones gráficas para resolver problemas.

estudiante mientras trabaja en casa.


**Formas Adicionales De Ayudar En Casa**


⬛
Encuentre paquetes, cajas de cartón, latas o cajas de otro tipo en su cocina que tengan etiquetas
donde se indiquen pesos o capacidades. Con su estudiante, convierta las medidas en unidades más
pequeñas o más grandes. Por ejemplo, su recipiente de leche podría tener una capacidad de 2 cuartos de galón. Haga la conversión para determinar cuántas tazas son. (2 cuartos de galón = 8 tazas)
Encuentre situaciones del mundo real durante el día que ayudarán al estudiante a pensar en las conversiones. Por ejemplo, pregúntele si tendría suficiente leche para una receta de sopa para la que se
necesitan 9 tazas si tuviera un recipiente de 2 cuartos de galón lleno de leche. (No; 2 cuartos de galón
son solo 8 tazas).


⬛
Encuentre una cinta métrica que mida distancias mayores que 1 yarda y muéstrela al estudiante.
Saque la cinta y pídale que examine las medidas. ¿Son unidades métricas (por ejemplo, centímetros)

     - unidades estandarizadas (por ejemplo, pulgadas)? ¿Cómo puede saberlo? Después, pídale que use
la cinta métrica para demostrar la equivalencia de las mediciones. Por ejemplo, podría pedirle que
demuestre que 1 pie y 3 pulgadas es equivalente a 15 pulgadas.

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 4


⬛
Con su estudiante, use fichas o pequeños trozos de papel para hacer ocho pares de tarjetas que
muestren medidas equivalentes. Por ejemplo, en una tarjeta, escriba libras; en otra tarjeta, escriba
52 onzas. Use medidas de longitud, peso, capacidad y tiempo. Después de hacer las tarjetas, juegue
un juego de memoria con su estudiante para encontrar las medidas equivalentes.


⬛
Haga que su estudiante mida varios objetos similares y registre las mediciones. Luego, pídale que
muestre los datos usando un diagrama de puntos o un diagrama de tallo y hojas. Su estudiante
puede crear una pregunta que puede responderse usando los datos. Por ejemplo, si mide las alturas
de varios muebles, una posible pregunta es: “¿Cuál es la diferencia de altura entre los muebles más
altos y más bajos que se midieron?”.
