**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 3. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. Teachers will explain these activity
pages to the students orally, using the instructions in the Teacher Guide. There are also instructions
on the activity pages for students to read themselves. The Activity Book is a student component,
which means each student should have an Activity Book.

Dear Family Member,


Your student has been reading _Healthy Humans: How to_
_Keep Your Body Strong_ and practicing reading fluently.
Please have your student read this excerpt from the text
aloud. Encourage your student to focus on accuracy
(reading the words correctly) and fluency (reading the
words smoothly). Ask your student to share what they’ve
learned so far from reading _Healthy Humans: How to Keep_
_Your Body Strong_ .


We sweat to cool down when we run around, especially on a sunny
day. This sweat is our body’s way of saying, “Whew! It’s hot!”


There are tunnels from the glands to our skin that send sweat to our
skin when we are too hot. The air dries the sweat, which is mostly
water, on our skin. It’s like getting out of a shower or pool and feeling
the cool air.


The sweat takes heat away as it dries, but it also takes away the water.
When we’re sweaty, there is no substitute for drinking water. Sweating
uses up some of our water, so we must drink more to stay cool and
hydrated.

Being healthy is important and there are easy things we can
do to keep germs away. Because our nose is a warm

to trap germ-filled water when we sneezeor blow
our noses. Another helpful tip is to wash your hands frequently. Water
works better when with soap. Also, remember to

Dear Family Member,


Your student is learning to add consonant (like – _ful_ ) and

with new meanings.


Have them read the words and suffixes in the first two
columns, then combine the base word and suffix to write
the new word in the third column. Remind them that a
consonant suffix does not change the base word; a vowel
suffix replaces the silent ‘e.’

**Greenfield**

As the sun was rising, it painted the sky with color. The sky was a
rainbow of red, orange, pink, and purple. The town of Greenfield
buzzed with excitement. It was Greenfield’s 100th birthday. The mayor
planned an amazing parade to celebrate. He invited the whole town.
Today was the parade, and everyone was gathering on Main Street.


Uma, a young girl living in Greenfield, was part of a dance team. The
mayor had asked her team to perform in the parade, so they had been
practicing every day as they learned the new dance. They even chose
new costumes for the parade that made them look like bright, smiling
suns. The weather on the day of the parade matched their costumes
perfectly!


As the parade began, Uma felt extremely happy to be a part of it. She
had never marched in a parade before, and she was proud to represent
her town and her team. She smiled as she marched down Main Street.


As her dance team performed their new dance, she recognized many
friends and neighbors. She smiled and waved to them. As the parade
ended, the people of Greenfield gathered for a festival in a park outside
of town hall. There was yummy food and a party band. As the sun set,
there was a loud bang! Red, yellow, and green fireworks exploded into
the air. Everyone cheered loudly. It was awesome!

**Pete’s Bike Ride**

Pete loved riding his bike to the lake. The sun was shining brightly as
he pedaled along the winding path. He passed tall trees and colorful
flowers on the way.


When Pete arrived at the lake, he saw a graceful swan gliding across
the water. It was all alone. Pete smiled and waved at the swan. He took
out his camera to capture the scene. Suddenly, the swan let out a soft
call, surprising Pete. He laughed and snapped a picture.


After spending some time by the lake, Pete turned his bike around and
started the journey back home. The breeze felt refreshing on his face
as he rode. He listened to the birds chirping happily in the trees. Pete
felt happy and content as he pedaled along the path. When he reached
home, he couldn’t wait to tell his family about his bike ride to the lake.
