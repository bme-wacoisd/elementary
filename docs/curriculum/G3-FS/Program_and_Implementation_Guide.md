### Introduction

Welcome to the Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts program! This Program and
Implementation Guide is intended to provide educators with information about the research,
structure, implementation, and approach to Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts.


It is highly recommended that teachers, administrators, coaches, and district instructional
staff read the Program and Implementation Guide before diving into the exciting and engaging
literacy lessons with students. This resource can be a helpful support for family members as well.
Throughout Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts, students will experience rich
content and complex texts that will enrich the breadth of their learning while augmenting daily
instruction.


This Program and Implementation Guide will provide educators with critical information on the
instructional nuances of the Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts Program that
bring a broad scope of knowledge coherence, creativity, and research-based instruction to the
forefront of Texas classrooms.


The Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts instructional materials have been
specifically designed by the Texas Education Agency for students served by Texas schools. The
materials intentionally draw upon Texas history, geography, and sociocultural contexts when
possible, in an effort to build additional knowledge of our great state.


In addition to increased knowledge-building about Texas, students and teachers will have
instructional opportunities to read, write, and think about the world beyond Texas through
various complex texts and learning tasks. Through exposure to deep content knowledge and
research-based foundational skills, this elementary instructional program fosters critical
thinking, listening, speaking, writing, reading, and inquiry development. The units strive to engage
all learners with diverse content while equipping teachers with the rich literature, lessons, and
resources needed to make learning impactful for every student.


This program offers:


  - Foundational Skills units aligned to TEKS and ELPS in Grades K–3


  - Reading Language Arts units aligned to TEKS and ELPS in Grades K–5

### Alignment to TEKS

Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts units are aligned to the English Language Arts
and Reading Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) and address the interconnected units of
language: listening, speaking, reading, writing, and thinking.

The seven strands of the TEKS are recursive and therefore spiral throughout Bluebonnet Learning [TM]
K–5 Reading Language Arts to explicitly address:

1. Sustaining foundational language skills
2. Comprehension
3. Response
4. Multiple genres
5. Author’s purpose and craft
6. Composition
7. Inquiry and research


The units have been developed with an integration of the seven strands, along with unit-specific
inquiry and research that progresses across the K–5 continuum. Additionally, both Bluebonnet
Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts and the TEKS foster social and academic language
proficiency for all learners. Throughout the implementation of the instructional program across
Grades K–5, students are applying TEKS standards through authentic learning tasks that embed
listening to learn, speaking to share, and writing to connect (Texas Education Agency, n.d.).


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **5**


### Alignment to ELPS

The English Language Proficiency Standards (ELPS) offer critical guidance for implementation of
Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts lessons in Kindergarten through Grade 5. The
program’s content-based approach provides Emergent Bilingual (EB) students with opportunities
to develop background knowledge, conceptual knowledge, academic knowledge, and secondlanguage acquisition skills (Texas Education Agency, n.d.).


The ELPS work alongside the TEKS to support social and academic language proficiency for EB
students. The integration of ELPS makes this instructional program an asset to content-based ESL
programs. The TEKS domains of listening, speaking, reading, writing, and thinking are embedded
within the ELPS to foster the academic success of EB students. The Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5
Reading Language Arts Program engages EB students in quality content-area instruction and
second-language vocabulary application. Strategic use of the students’ first language will aid in
supporting linguistic, affective, cognitive, and academic development of the English language.


In accordance with the ELPS, students’ varied levels of English language proficiency—including
beginning, intermediate, advanced, and advanced-high—are considered throughout Bluebonnet
Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts. Essentially, students’ varied levels of English language
proficiency are considered to ensure that appropriate instructional accommodations are made for
EB students to access the literacy curriculum.

### Approach to Instruction


Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K-5 Reading Language Arts (RLA) weaves together elements of the
science of reading with a knowledge building approach as done in classical education to deliver a
comprehensive Reading Language Arts program.


Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts is guided by extensive research on the science
of reading, which is a compilation of research-based best practices for literacy instruction. In order
for students to get optimal results from our literacy instruction, language comprehension and word


**6** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


recognition must work hand in hand. In other words, the recognition of sounds, letters, and words
integrated with knowledge, vocabulary, sentences, connections, and gist are the makings of the
most impactful reading instruction for students.


In Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts, instructional Reading Language Arts units
are centered around complex texts that are intentionally sequenced to build content knowledge
and vocabulary across the K–5 program. Cervetti, Wright, and Hwang (2016) emphasize that
“knowledge can be built and leveraged simultaneously,” which emphasizes the importance of
building knowledge and vocabulary through text in all content areas. The Bluebonnet Learning [TM]
K–5 Reading Language Arts Knowledge units build knowledge coherence with a focus on
literature, history, science, and the arts. Unit topics may have some overlap with content required
by science and social studies TEKS, but are not designed to cover the requirements of those
standards. Because research shows that students’ listening comprehension outpaces their reading
comprehension until their early teens, the program strategically uses Read-Aloud text in this
strand, allowing students to focus their cognitive energy on gaining meaning from the words and
better understanding from the images. As Shanahan (2020) highlights, exposing students to more
complex text is crucial for challenging their understanding and fostering deeper comprehension.


Through integration of the language comprehension and word recognition strands, the program
is designed to produce increasingly automatic and strategic student performance of literacy
tasks. Through research-based pedagogy, teachers will encourage students to build connections
and context, and listen and understand, while emphasizing interactivity and assessing what is
important.


The content of the intentionally sequenced knowledge units in the Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K-5
Reading Language Arts product have been chosen consistent with the approach of a classical
education. A classical education provides numerous benefits for K-12 students, emphasizing a
well-rounded foundation in the liberal arts and sciences, along with a focus on critical thinking
and eloquent expression. This approach cultivates a depth of understanding and appreciation for
historical contexts, enabling students to draw connections between past and present. Through its
integration of literature, science, the arts, and history, classical education encourages students to
deepen their understanding of how our society has changed over time. This approach is paired in
the early grades with a focus on foundational literacy skills including phonics, spelling, handwriting,
and grammar. This holistic approach not only enriches students’ intellectual development but also
nurtures positive character traits and civic responsibility.


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **7**


### Grades K–2

In Grades K–2, students have the opportunity to develop foundational skills and knowledge
coherence through a dual approach.


The Foundational Skills units focus on comprehensive instruction in foundational literacy skills,
including print concepts, phonological awareness, phonics, word recognition, and fluency. In
addition, vocabulary development, conventions of English, syntax, spelling, grammar, reading
comprehension, and writing instruction are key components of the Skills units.


The Reading Language
Arts units focus on
knowledge coherence
for students to review
prior knowledge and
vocabulary words; listen
to rich, complex ReadAlouds; and extend
growing background
knowledge through
engaging activities.


The design of K–2
Reading Language
Arts units recognizes
the importance of
developing students’
listening comprehension to support building background knowledge that will allow for independent
reading comprehension in the later grades. This research further supports that idea.


This graph shows students’ listening and reading comprehension abilities from age one to age
thirteen. Students’ listening comprehension is not equivalent to their reading comprehension until
age thirteen. Students’ listening comprehension far outpaces their reading comprehension for
many years. To build students’ background knowledge, texts are read aloud to them so that, when
their reading comprehension catches up, they will have the background knowledge they need to


**8** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


comprehend the texts. For this reason, texts are read orally. Students do not have a copy of the text
printed in front of them.


The Reading Language Arts texts are written at a text complexity level two grades higher than that
of the students so that they have the experience of comprehending complex texts orally, before
doing it independently in subsequent years. Therefore, it is important to read the text as is rather
than paraphrase it. This will ensure that your students are being exposed to rigorous texts.

### Grade 3


In Grade 3, students have the opportunity to develop foundational literacy skills through units
that focus on language, phonemic awareness, sound-spelling patterns, regular and irregular highfrequency words, and decoding and encoding one-syllable or multisyllable words. Vocabulary
instruction is also embedded to build students’ understanding around word parts, meaning, and
academic and social language.


In addition to the Foundational Skills units, Grade 3 has the opportunity to engage in deep conceptual
knowledge-building through the integrated approach of Reading Language Arts. Building on what
has been learned in K-2, the lessons follow a planned sequence from simpler to more complex lettersound correspondences and spelling patterns, as opposed to teaching phonics rules and patterns
incidentally as they arise in the text. Students will also have active practice opportunities to transfer
and apply what they are learning. As students practice with the Readers, they not only build fluency,
they also have opportunities to discuss the text to build comprehension.


Grade 3 Foundational Skills units are structured as thirty minutes of instructional time focused
on explicit instruction of the foundational reading skills. These units follow a distinct scope and
sequence that is separate from the foundational skills instruction integrated into RLA units. It is
not required to implement both programs in third grade. If districts or schools decide to implement
both programs, plan for a total of 150 minutes of literacy instruction in the daily schedule.


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **9**


### Grades 4 and 5

In Grades 4 and 5, students have the opportunity to develop foundational literacy skills and
knowledge coherence through an integrated approach. The Knowledge sequence of units in
Grades 4 and 5 is designed to build a robust knowledge base that students can draw upon as they
encounter new complex texts, content, and material.


In Grades 4 and 5, students will apply and integrate foundational skills as they engage with
increasingly complex text, organized around Knowledge units. Purposeful re-reading, collaborative
conversations, response to literature, writing, vocabulary, morphology, and word structure are
integral components of the program for upper-grade students. Much like the Grade 3 RLA units,
Grades 4 and 5 will continue to build their knowledge coherence across academic content while
exploring cross-curricular connections of history, science, and literary themes.


**10** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


### Foundational Literacy and the Science of Teaching Reading

With the Science of Teaching Reading approach, students will practice and build their literacy
skills every day in the Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts Program. In Grades
K–3, students will engage in explicit instruction to develop and grow their literacy skills, as well as
develop knowledge coherence across a variety of themes to build and deepen their knowledge of
reading, vocabulary, and content knowledge.


In the upper grades, skills instruction becomes integrated within knowledge lessons where
students can apply their foundational literacy skills through increasingly complex content-rich
texts, purposeful re-reading, and greater emphasis on writing. Students begin to use their skills
to understand complex ideas and engage more deeply in academic content across subject areas,
including key historical events, literary works, and science concepts.


The Science of Teaching Reading is based on a strong skills foundation, knowledge and context, and
relevant, challenging texts.


Components necessary to build reading comprehension are founded in the development of
decoding and language comprehension.


Gough, Philip E. and William. E. Tumner. “ _Decoding, Reading, and Reading Disability_ .” Remedial and Special Education 7, no. 1 (1986): 6-10


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **11**


**What is decoding?** Decoding supports students in the ability to apply sound-symbol relationships
to read words, starting with sounds. This includes a strong foundation in phonetic knowledge.


**What is language comprehension?** Language comprehension supports students in the ability to
understand spoken language and written language.


In order to build decoding and language comprehension skills, students must gain foundational
literacy knowledge in the following areas:

##### **Phonological Awareness**


All instruction starts with phonological awareness, which research shows benefits the greatest
number of students. Students begin by learning to recognize sounds as well as to articulate them.







Opportunities for assessment are integrated
throughout all Teacher Guides.


Skills lessons are carefully structured to make
it easier to keep your focus on teacher-student
interaction.


Deliberate practice steps keep students laser
focused on acquiring new skills.


Interactive steps keep students engaged
while learning.

##### **Crack the Code**

Once students recognize sounds, they learn to form the corresponding letter codes. The program
starts by teaching the sound-spellings that appear most frequently in English, which enables your
students to read and write as many words as possible.

Students in higher grades of the Elementary
Literacy Program are prepared to take on
more advanced foundational skills, including
morphology, Latin roots, and suffixes.

##### **Systematic Direct Instruction**

The K–3 Foundational Skills lessons are systematically sequenced so that the material progresses
gradually from less complex to more complex (Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development, NIH, DHHS, 2000). Within this sequence, students engage in explicit
and intentional opportunities to practice the foundational skills in isolation and through decodable text.
Through this explicit systematic instruction, students build their foundational literacy skills that support
the practice of reading. As students build their literacy skills, they apply these skills within grade-level
appropriate texts to acquire knowledge coherence, new vocabulary, and reading response skills.


**Systematic direct instruction:**


The K–3 Foundational Skills explicit instruction is systematic, direct, engaging, and promotes
achievement for all students (Archer & Hughes, 2011). The key components include:


- introducing foundational literacy concepts directly through demonstration and use of clear
language in structured lessons;

- including explanation, modeling, guided practice, opportunities to practice new learning, and
immediate corrective feedback; and

- occurring in whole group, small group, or individual instructional settings.

If additional support is needed in providing foundational skills instruction in the upper grades,
teachers can utilize the Foundational Skills Appendices found in Grade 4 Unit 1 and Grade 5 Unit
1. This resource provides systematic guidance and can be used flexibly to deliver TEKS-aligned
explicit, direct instruction that addresses skill gaps in a targeted way.


This guide contains the following:

### Knowledge Coherence K–5

To support academically and culturally competent literacy, the Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading
Language Arts program continually engages students with rich content knowledge. The RLA
units across Grades K–5 allow students to make authentic, real-life, and academically relevant
connections to the TEKS standards. Throughout the instructional program and within each lesson,
students are continually building background, conceptual, and academic knowledge integrated
within culture-, history-, and literature-rich content.


Research has found that proficiency gaps in reading are often tied to knowledge gaps. Based on
the following data, students with high knowledge can perform at higher levels even if they have
lower reading skills. This is why the Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts program
emphasizes instruction around knowledge coherence.


Other research has shown that focusing on skills at the expense of knowledge can hinder
performance. More time practicing skills does not necessarily equal increased proficiency.
Therefore, building background knowledge, conceptual knowledge, and academic knowledge is a
necessity to support students in building reading competency. Sustaining and spiraling schemas
and vocabulary can improve students ability to comprehend.


**18** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


##### **Background Knowledge**

Building background knowledge allows students to use their own cognitive bank of prior knowledge
to access content. Research shows that prior knowledge creates a scaffolding for information in
memory. Essentially, background knowledge builds a foundation of learning for all students (Recht
& Leslie, 1988).


For this reason, in the Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts program, in Lesson 1,
Core Connections are specifically designed to build background knowledge. Core Connections allow
teachers and students to revisit prior knowledge from previous units, along with new knowledge
needed for upcoming lessons. Across Grades K–5, background knowledge systematically builds from
year to year.

##### **Conceptual Knowledge**


Conceptual knowledge helps students understand why they need to learn the skills they are
acquiring during the learning process. Concepts are the scaffolds needed for the authentic
application of skills.


In fact, researchers Recht and Leslie (1988) had students reenact the baseball plays outlined in a
story and found that reading ability had little impact on how well students understood the story.
Students who were weak readers did as well as strong readers if they had knowledge of baseball.


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **19**


From this research, we learn that conceptual knowledge puts learning into context for students
Recht and Leslie’s research proved that simply reading about a concept does not create lasting
foundational knowledge. It is essential to put learning into context for students by integrating
realistic opportunities to practice the knowledge they have acquired.


In the Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts program, conceptual knowledge is
embedded within the rich and authentic text selections and the focus on vocabulary acquisition
across Knowledge units.


Furthermore, the focus on conceptual knowledge in the program’s text selections support
immersive discussions about concepts before deep-diving into academic knowledge.

##### **Academic Knowledge**


Academic knowledge is the baseline for any instructional program and includes content and skills
of which students must demonstrate proficiency or mastery. In the Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5
Reading Language Arts program, academic knowledge is driven by the TEKS. As students progress
across Grades K–5, the academic knowledge gained from reading is paramount.


Teaching knowledge explicitly improves reading comprehension and is the primary reason there is
a focus on knowledge coherence in this literacy program. The Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading
Language Arts program embeds informational texts across the K–5 Knowledge units to ensure
that students develop a firm grasp of the academic knowledge necessary to better understand
what they are reading. Additionally, students will have ample opportunities within the program to
demonstrate academic knowledge through integrated writing tasks.


The academic knowledge being built in K-5 Reading Language Arts Units can reinforce and connect
to some concepts from the Social Studies and Science disciplines. For example, Kindergarten
teachers will be able to guide students in connecting the knowledge built on George Washington
studied in Reading Language Arts Unit 10, with his contributions to Texas and the nation, in support
of Kindergarten Social Studies TEKS strands. However, K-5 RLA units are designed to teach only
the English Language Arts and Reading TEKS to mastery. These units should not be used to either
replace instruction in subject areas of Social Studies or Science or to modify the time dedicated to
those disciplines.

##### **Language Comprehension**

Within the Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts program, there is an emphasis on
vocabulary that promotes students’ understanding of commonly known words, academic language,
and unit-specific content words. This emphasis supports students in building their language
comprehension skills. Students encounter these new words authentically within texts, and then
practice and use these words while responding to their reading orally and in written forms. This
helps students develop a wider range of complex vocabulary, knowledge coherence, and writing
skills. The vocabulary words are strategically aligned to the topic or theme of each unit. Language
comprehension is interconnected to the knowledge coherence to build background knowledge for
all students and increase reading comprehension skills.


**22** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


### Religious Source Material in Reading Language Arts

The study of Reading Language Arts gives students access to rich texts that further their
understanding of our society, including our history, economy, and culture. Rich texts are
interspersed throughout this product for that purpose, and they periodically include content that
comes from different religious traditions, including various monotheistic and polytheistic faiths
around the world.


It is important to note that including content from or about religious source material in these
instructional materials is not for the purpose of advancing any particular religious belief. Rather, it
is included for the literary and historical value of the content and its connection to creating a strong
background of knowledge for students.

##### **Rationale and Relevance**


There are varied religious source materials used in this product. One example of this is content that
comes from the Hebrew Scriptures, also known as the Tanakh, which are viewed as sacred texts
by members of the Jewish religion. Another example is the Bible, which is a collection of books,
including those of the Old Testament and the New Testament, that are viewed as sacred texts
by members of the Christian religion. Other examples include content that comes from faiths of
ancient civilizations, including the polytheism of ancient Greece and the ancient Maya. Students
will also encounter content that would be recognized by those who practice Islam, Buddhism, and
other faiths. Regardless of the nature of the religious source material used, content is chosen for its
relevance both to our students’ future academic studies and to their adult lives in our country.


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **23**


One example of this relevance is found in content that comes from the Bible. The Bible exists in
various translations, and, across those translations, is the most printed book produced in human
history. The Bible’s centrality to American culture is demonstrated by the inclusion of biblical
references throughout American historical texts, laws, and symbols. For example, the Liberty Bell
includes an inscription from Leviticus, and multiple Bible quotations are featured on the walls of the
Library of Congress. Laws set down in Exodus and Leviticus served as an inspiration for multiple
US laws, including bankruptcy laws. Many of the country’s founders, abolitionist leaders, and civil
rights leaders recognized the Bible as critical in informing the laws for which they advocated.


Furthermore, many canonical works of Western literature cannot be fully understood without a
background in biblical narratives, requiring students to be taught these narratives to fully engage
with that literature. For example, authors such as William Faulkner, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman
Melville, John Steinbeck, and Toni Morrison have written novels that are rich with biblical imagery
and allusion. Hundreds of idioms in the English language have their origin in the Bible. For example,
students need to understand that someone described as a person who has the “wisdom of
Solomon” has excellent judgment or that the saying “My cup runneth over” means that the person
feels overwhelmingly fortunate.


Finally, content has been chosen based on the complexity and imagery of the written language
to ensure an appropriate grade-level match for students. Understanding archaic language and
vocabulary common to religious source material is essential to building reading comprehension
more broadly. For source material that originated in a language other than English, effort was taken
to choose translations that are widely recognized and that have an open copyright.

##### **The Role of the Teacher in Rich Discussions**


When classroom lessons include content from religious source materials, some students may
pose questions about religious tenets during the discussion that do not occur with other reading
material. These discussions are not prohibited in public schools, as students have a constitutional
right to be their religious selves at school. But as would occur with any other text or lesson,
teachers should focus class discussions on the lesson’s learning standards, objectives, and
activities.


**24** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


Some students may have prior experience with these texts. Some students may not. Context has
been provided when relevant in the teacher’s guide to ensure students have sufficient background
on the religious source to engage with the content.


Texas law outlines requirements for public schools to include curriculum that is well-rounded and
covers varying subjects, including content from religious source material. Texas Education Code
Sec. 28.002 requires that curriculum includes “religious literature, including the Hebrew Scriptures
(Old Testament) and New Testament, and its impact on history and literature.”


Reading Language Arts content in these instructional materials that comes from religious
sources has been designed to be presented objectively as part of a secular program of education.
Texas statute provides assurances for teachers as they deliver instruction on this content.
Texas Education Code Sec. 22.0512 provides that public school teachers may not be subject to
disciplinary proceedings from an allegation, that does not dispute that they deliver instruction from
these instructional materials with fidelity, that they violated the Establishment Clause of the First
Amendment of the United States Constitution.

### Writing About Reading


Text-based responses included in the Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts program
engage students in speaking and writing about the texts they read and enhance students’
knowledge through a reciprocal approach of reading and writing. Text-based responses allow

students to conceptualize texts by using evidence to support their reasoning and understanding
of the texts read. In addition, students have the opportunity to develop oral and written
communication skills, as well as work toward mastery of the composition TEKS, while analyzing
content-rich texts.


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **25**


##### **Grade 4 Reading Language Arts,** **Unit 5, Lesson 8 Writing Prompt**

This example from Grade 4, Unit 5, Lesson 8 shows how students will use paragraph-writing
skills to reflect upon the role that the first shot fired in Lexington played in igniting the American
Revolutionary War. Students will use knowledge learned from the texts, providing text evidence to
support their reasoning. Also included are additional resources and a graphic organizer that align to
the TEKS.


**26** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


##### **Grade K Reading Language Arts,** **Unit 6, Lesson 2 Writing Prompt**

This example from Grade K, Unit 6, Lesson 2 shows how students will generate ideas and develop a
draft for writing based on the texts they have read in class. Students will learn about early American
settlements through their readings and class discussion. This knowledge will support students in
creating their unit pamphlets.

##### **Genre Writing**


Students hone their craft as writers by studying authors and developing writing pieces of different
genres for multiple purposes according to grade-level TEKS.

### Program Structure and Resources

The Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts program is structured to provide a
comprehensive approach to literacy that intentionally builds background knowledge early while
strengthening and developing foundational skills in students.


The instructional materials are split into grade bands for Grade K–2 students and Grade 3–5
students. It is important for teachers to note that a key component of the program includes the
two strands of Foundational Skills and Reading Language Arts. The strands have fundamental
implementation differences across the K–2 and 3–5 grade bands.


Grades K–2 consist of daily Foundational Skills and RLA instruction, taught in separate
instructional blocks. The daily Foundational Skills lessons teach reading and writing in tandem,
which help support learning related to phonemic awareness, sound-letter patterns, or spelling
patterns. As a result, Grade K–2 Foundational Skills lessons support instruction of comprehensive
decoding, writing mechanics, structure, and processes.


In Grades K–2, daily Reading Language Arts lessons provide background, academic, and conceptual
knowledge to ensure students are prepared to transition from learning to read to reading for
comprehension and application purposes. The Reading Language Arts units are built upon a coherent
knowledge sequence resulting from years of research and consultation with content experts,
educators, cognitive scientists, and others. The sequence is designed to build upon earlier content so
that students become generally knowledgeable in the early grades and can rely on a robust web of
prior knowledge when encountering new complex texts and material in later grades.


In Grade 3, the program structure transitions to combine foundational literacy and language
arts instruction together into integrated units that build background knowledge via the study of
complex texts. In addition, a strand of Foundational Skills units for 3rd grade is now available. The
daily foundational skills lessons are structured similarly to the Grade K-2 units, teaching phonics,
high frequency words, decoding and encoding, and morphology; grounded in decodable readers. It
is not required to implement both strands with third grade students.


In Grades 4 and 5, the Reading Language Arts units are taught as an integrated instructional block.
Integration of foundational skills and knowledge coherence in Grades 4 and 5 ensures students
become competent in all communication modes, including reading, writing, listening, and speaking.


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **29**


In Grades K–5, each of the grade bands are structured as follows:


Foundational Skills

Each grade level has a different number of units and corresponding daily instructional time
allocated for each lesson. When planning for implementation, please refer to the recommended
daily instructional time outlined in the chart.

|Kindergarten|Grade 1|Grade 2|Grade 3|
|---|---|---|---|
|9 units|7 units|6 units|10 units|
|60 minutes|60 minutes|60 minutes|30 minutes|



All Foundational Skills lessons include some or all of the following segments:




- Foundational Skills: Students learn print concepts,

phonological and phonemic awareness, phonics and word

recognition, and fluency. Instruction of foundational skills

are explicit and targeted to individual student’s needs.


- Language: Students focus on grammar, writing mechanics,

language conventions, spelling, and vocabulary.


- Reading: Students practice decoding and comprehension

with decodable chapter books, text- based questions, and

written response activities.


- Writing: Students learn about the writing process and key

text types through connected reading and writing tasks.




- Speaking and Listening (integrated into other segments):

Students engage in collaborative discussion, including

partner and small-group work.


- Handwriting and Cursive: In Grade 2 and 3, students have

instructional opportunities to refine their penmanship

through handwriting and cursive writing practice.


- Additional Support: Each lesson features an Additional

Support section at the end with targeted activities for

additional practice.



**30** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


Reading Language Arts

Each grade level has a different number of units for Reading Language Arts, but the daily
instructional time allocated for each lesson is consistent across all grades. When planning for
implementation, please refer to the chart for the recommended daily instructional time.

|Kindergarten|Grade 1|Grade 2|
|---|---|---|
|11 units|10 units|11 units|
|60 minutes|60 minutes|60 minutes|



All Reading Language Arts lessons follow the same structure:

- Core Connections (Lesson 1 only): Review prior knowledge from past domains and previous years along with upcoming

lessons.


- Introducing the Read-Aloud: Review the previous day’s Read-Aloud and introduce the day’s topic.


- Presenting the Read-Aloud: Teachers present the day’s complex Read-Aloud, asking text-dependent questions and engaging

students with rich visuals. Read-Alouds also include Word Work.


- Application: Students apply what they’ve learned through dynamic collaboration and writing activities.


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **31**


Integrated Reading Language Arts and Foundational Skills Strand

Each grade level has the same number of units, but the daily instructional time allocated for
each lesson varies. When planning for implementation, please refer to the recommended daily
instructional time outlined in the chart.

|Grade 3|Grade 4|Grade 5|
|---|---|---|
|10 units|10 units|10 units|
|120 minutes|90 minutes|90 minutes|



Knowledge coherence and foundational skills are integrated, and each unit is organized
around anchor texts. All Grade 3–5 lessons include some or all of the following segments:




- Core Connections (Lesson 1): Review prior knowledge

from past domains and units as well as upcoming

lessons.


- Reading: Each lesson is organized around knowledge
rich reading on the unit’s topic. Rich chapter books,

articles, and trade books are used for whole-group,

partner, small-group, and independent reading.


- Writing: Reading and writing are interconnected as

students take on more complex writing projects.


- Language: In Grades 4–5, students begin to sharpen

their grammar, morphology, and spelling skills.




- Speaking and Listening: In Grades 4–5, Read-Alouds become

less prominent, as independent reading, speaking, and

listening are integrated into other segments for demonstration

of reading comprehension and vocabulary application.


- Handwriting and Cursive: In Grades 3–5, students will also

have instructional opportunities to refine their penmanship

through handwriting and cursive

writing practice.


- Additional Support: Each lesson features an Additional

Support section at the end with targeted activities for

additional practice.


- Core Quests: In Grades 3–5, students will have opportunities

to extend knowledge through interactive learning quests.

### Materials and Resources

Resources embedded within the curriculum are intended to support implementation of instruction
for teachers and optimize learning for students. Materials and resources include the following:

##### **Teacher Guides**


Teacher Guides are available in Grades K–5 and outline the daily instruction to support teachers
in planning and annotating lessons. Each of the Teacher Guides lays out the scope and sequence
of lessons in a manner that helps teachers plan instruction for a wide range of learners. Teacher
Guides highlight primary focus objectives and tie practice activities to scaffolded instruction toward
mastery of content for students. Teacher Guides include a Lesson at-a-Glance chart for each
lesson, which outlines lesson segments, groupings, time, and materials. In addition, Teacher Guides
provide an understanding of overall unit goals and include appendices with additional professional
resources and Blackline Masters required for implementation of the instructional materials.


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **33**


##### **Student Readers**

In Grades K–3 Foundational Skills, the Student Readers provide students with decodable text
explicitly connected to the phonics scope and sequence. Students practice code and word patterns
they’ve learned and begin using Readers for comprehension purposes. In Grade 3, the Student
Readers are built around practicing cumulative decoding
skills. These Student Readers help students contextualize
meaning as they read. Student Readers in the program
represent grade-level text with embedded supports to help
students recognize patterns taught. For example, Student
Readers include bolded words that help students recognize
familiar word patterns they have learned. Additionally,
underlined text serves as markers for students to indicate
that parts of a word may be tricky and do not apply to a code/
pattern they have learned. Readers are designed so that
each student can hold a Reader in their hands for tangible
decoding and fluency practice. Additional stories are available
for practice and help students get more volume of reading
connected to the explicit phonics instruction.


In Grades 3–5, the Readers are students’ source of
background knowledge and story development. Students
engage with the content of the Readers daily, with a new
focus on extracting meaning from texts and using the text
to aid in speaking, listening, and writing. Each Student
Reader represents complex grade-level texts for equitable
engagement of all learners and allows teachers to provide
instructional scaffolding based on students’ needs. Each
book develops a particular area of knowledge for exposure
of rich vocabulary with layers of meaning for comprehension
skill development. In all grade levels, Student Readers
increase in text complexity as students progress through the
K–5 learning continuum.


**34** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


Big Questions prompt students to think and ask
questions before, during, and after reading.


Vocabulary words are highlighted, encouraging
students to learn them in context.


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **35**


##### **Text Types**

The Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts instructional materials explicitly addresses
the multigenre strand of TEKS through an array of texts to include literary nonfiction, fairy tales,
folktales, poetry, informational text, and drama. Moreover, text types in the instructional program
serve as anchors for the response, comprehension, author’s purpose, and inquiry and research
strands while fostering application of the TEKS strands of listening, speaking, writing, reading, and
thinking.


**Text Complexity**
Texts included in the Bluebonnet Learning [TM] instructional materials have the appropriate level of
complexity for the grade according to their quantitative and qualitative analysis and relation to
student tasks. Texts are selected or developed using quantitative measures, such as Lexile® text
measures, which measure text difficulty based on factors such as sentence and word length and
frequency of unfamiliar words. Read-aloud texts will be above grade level in complexity, as students
will be able to engage in more complex texts through teacher guidance. Independent reading texts
have been selected or developed using the Lexile® research-based text range for college and career
readiness as a reference.


Texts are also selected or developed using qualitative measures, such as text structure, language
features, knowledge-building demands, and the text’s purpose. Read-aloud texts focus on
facilitating student engagement and building constructive context to relevant units of study
through teacher guidance. This provides students with ongoing opportunities to listen, think, and
critically respond to grade-level texts. Independent reading texts establish text complexity through
the evaluation of the text’s structure, language features, knowledge building and activity, and
purpose. For more information regarding text complexity, reference the Reader Information guides.


**36** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


Students will have opportunities within the program to engage with mentor texts that model
benchmarks for their own narrative, expository, and argumentative writing. Students in Grades K–5
experience reading through text types with different purposes, to include the following:


**Knowledge-Based Texts**
The texts used within units expose students to content across the curriculum while building
background knowledge, conceptual knowledge, and academic knowledge. Texts in the program
foster continual vocabulary acquisition and critical thinking. Students respond to texts through
formative application of listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Multiple genres of texts are used
to support critical thinking and students’ metacognition across the curriculum. In this program,
students will explore varied text types to explicitly build background and conceptual knowledge
that augments academic knowledge across the curriculum.


**Read-Aloud Texts**
Read-Alouds aid in closing the reading comprehension gap for learners. Fundamentally, students’
listening comprehension outpaces their reading comprehension until age thirteen. Therefore,
lessons have been strategically structured to ensure students have the opportunity to listen to, and
engage with, interactive Read-Aloud texts that build knowledge around content. While Read-Aloud
texts are embedded in the curriculum for students in Grades K–5, students in Grades 3–5 also have
increasingly more strategic practice with independent reading selections to augment and develop
reading comprehension skills (Lane & Wright, 2007).


**Licensed Texts**
The majority of texts included in this product are considered open source, which means that
digital versions are available for free. However, some units incorporate licensed texts, including
tradebooks and novel studies. These texts, as well as texts such as ReadWorks passages that
are included in some units, can be independently sourced online, at a local library, or at a local
bookstore. For information about texts for each unit, see the Program Navigation Guide.


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **37**


##### **Interacting with Texts**

The Bluebonnet Learning instructional materials incorporate five reading methods to support
students with accessing, studying, and responding to texts in Foundational Skills and Reading
Language Arts units across grades K-5.


**Method # 1: Read-Aloud**


What is Read-Aloud?

In a read-aloud, the teacher reads a complex text aloud to the whole class. While reading aloud, the
teacher displays a book or images related to the text and pauses frequently to encourage student
engagement through active listening, answering questions, and making connections.


Where does Read-Aloud occur?

Read-alouds are embedded in K-5 Reading Language Arts units, and occur daily in K-2 RLA units.
Teachers read-aloud frequently in 3rd grade RLA units where students may follow along in the
Student Reader. This method is used less frequently in 4th and 5th grades, only occuring in one
unit per grade: Innovation and Industry in Energy in 4th grade, and Juneteenth in 5th grade.


Why is Read-Aloud Utilized?

Active listening to texts aligns with foundational language Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills
(TEKS) and research-based best practices for developing language comprehension. TEKS

understanding.

























_Grade K RLA Unit 10 Lesson 1_





_Grade 3 RLA Unit 9 Lesson 5_


**38** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


In addition, the Texas Reading Academies identifies listening comprehension as “an important
precursor to reading comprehension…Listening comprehension enables [students] to understand,
remember, discuss, retell, and summarize a complex text. [Students] use the same comprehension
processes when [they] listen and read.” (Module 5E: Oral Language and Vocabulary) As language
and vocabulary develop through regular experience with active listening. Students are wellequipped to shift to reading complex texts independently.


**Method # 2: Teacher Demonstration**


What is Teacher Demonstration?

In teacher demonstration, the teacher reads aloud from a decodable text with the whole class or
in small groups. Students follow along in the text using either a Big Book or Student Reader. The
teacher pauses frequently to model applying foundational literacy skills such as print awareness
and decoding words. The teacher also models fluent reading.


Where does Teacher Demonstration occur?

Teacher Demonstration is utilized in K-1 Foundational Skills. The method is phased out in first
grade after Unit Two as students become stronger independent readers.


Why is Teacher Demonstration utilized?

Teacher modeling of reading is crucial because the teacher can clearly and directly demonstrate
reading strategies. This allows students to observe an experienced reader decoding words and
modeling comprehension strategies to access the meaning of the text. This method is also an
important component of gradually releasing responsibility to students as they become increasingly
independent readers.



~~**TEACHER DEMONSTRATION (10 MIN.)**~~


**Read “Seth”**

   - Load or display the story “Seth” from the _Seth_ Big Book.


   - Have students turn to the table of contents in their Readers and locate the
page on which the story “Seth” begins (page 2).


   - Have students read the title of the story.


   - Read the story “Seth” once without interruption, running a finger beneath the
words as you read them, as students follow along in their Readers.


   - Read the story a second time, pausing to point out that the first letter in a
digraph (e.g., _This_ ) or in any word is capitalized if it is at the beginning of
a sentence.


   - If you have time, read the story again.

_Grade 1 FS Unit 2 Lesson 1_


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **39**


**Method # 3: Student Reading**


What is Student Reading?

In student reading, students read texts in a variety of ways. Students may read along with the whole
class, in small groups, with a partner, or individually. The teacher guides students by strategically
questioning, clarifying, and supporting students in monitoring their comprehension of the text.


Where does Student Reading occur?

Reading takes place in K-3rd grade Foundational Skills units when students read decodable texts.
In 3rd-5th grade Reading Language Arts lessons, students read complex texts. Note that in K-2nd
grade Reading Language Arts units, the complex texts are designed to be read aloud. See page 8 of
this guide for more information on text complexity in the K-2nd grade RLA program.


Why is Student Reading Utilized?


_**With Decodable Text…**_


According to the Texas Reading Academies, instruction on phonics concepts should be followed
by opportunities for students to read to find sound-spelling patterns in an extended text. This
reinforces the concept that decoding text is to read words in a connected text. (Module 8:
Decoding, Encoding, and Word Study). As students become proficient at decoding, they can apply
the phonics skills they have learned to complex texts that are read with increasing independence.


With Complex Text…

In each grade level, students must recognize and analyze literary elements within and across
increasingly complex texts, as well as characteristics, structures, and purposes in both literary
and informational texts. As teachers strategically clarify or extend student thinking, students can
demonstrate their understanding of the text.







~~**READ A TALK WITH ANIMALS (10 MIN.)**~~


   - Explain that today students will read _A Talk with Animals_, their new Unit 2
Reader.


   - Preview the following vocabulary words that students will encounter in this
section of the Reader. Have students work with a partner to decode the
words in isolation first and go over the correct pronunciation of each word.


**savanna, n.,** a big, open area of land covered mostly with grass and a few
scattered trees
Example: Elephants love to roam across the savanna, munching on grass
and finding waterholes to drink from.


**revealed, v.,** showing something that was hidden or kept secret
Example: When she opened the treasure chest, the shiny gold coins inside
were revealed.


_Grade 3 FS Unit 2 Lesson 1_



_Grade K FS Unit 9 Lesson 8_


**40** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


**Method #4: Purposeful Re-Reading**


What is Purposeful Re-Reading?

In purposeful re-reading, students read decodable and complex texts for a second time as a
whole group, in small groups, with partners, or individually. The method is used intentionally
and strategically with texts that require a second reading to help deepen student understanding.
Purposeful re-reading is not utilized with all texts.


Where does Purposeful Re-Reading occur?

Purposeful re-reading is used in 2nd grade Foundational Skills and 3rd-5th grade Reading Language
Arts units. The method is used in several lessons per unit, in most units per grade.


Why is Purposeful Re-Reading utilized?

Purposeful re-reading supports coverage of TEKS Strand 5, which requires critical thinking about
texts. As students engage in purposeful re-reading, they analyze the author’s choices and how
those choices influence and communicate meaning within a variety of texts. When students

grade-level TEKS.









_Grade 2 FS Unit 6 Lesson 22_


~~**INTRODUCE THE RE-READING (10 MIN.)**~~


                            - Tell students they will engage in a purposeful re-reading of Winston
Churchill’s address from Chapter 2, “War Begins,” which they read in the
previous lesson.


                             - Explain that the focus of the purposeful re-reading activity is to identify text
evidence that reveals the purpose, audience, and message of Churchill’s
speech.


                           - Remind students that Churchill delivered this speech to the House of
Commons in Great Britain, directly after the evacuation of French and British
troops at Dunkirk. Britain and its allies had just suffered a major defeat, with
thousands of casualties. At the same time, they had also just experienced
an important triumph, having impressively rescued and evacuated so many
retreating troops.


                           - Display the Structure, Purpose, and Audience Poster and invite student
volunteers to recall what they learned in the previous lesson about what it
means to find the purpose and audience of a text.


_Grade 5 RLA Unit 7 Lesson 3_


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **41**


**Method # 5: Reading Assessment**


What is Reading Assessment?

In reading assessments, students independently read and respond to questions about an
assessment passage. Teachers use data from student responses to plan instruction. More
information about assessments can be found on page 68 of this guide.


Where do Reading Assessments occur?

In 1st-3rd grade Foundational Skills and 3rd–5th grade Reading Language Arts, most units include
an assessment with at least one passage and aligned comprehension questions. K-2 RLA units do
not include a passage-reading assessment since students do not independently read the complex
texts in those units. Each RLA unit offers a print or digital assessment option.


Why are Reading Assessments utilized?

Student Assessment enables students to demonstrate what they have learned throughout the
unit. Teachers leverage the results of reading assessments to inform instruction.

**End-of-Unit Assessment—The Middle Ages**

**Reading Comprehension**

_Today you will read two selections related to the Middle Ages. After reading the first_
_selection, you will answer several questions based on it. Then, you will read the second_
_selection and answer several questions based on it. Some of the questions have two parts._
_You should answer Part A of the question before you answer Part B._

**Early Castles in England and France**


1 Castles in the Middle Ages served to protect and shelter kings and nobles. They were
also a base from which to launch an attack. Castles were initially wooden fort-like
structures. Over time, people replaced the wood with stone, and they added towers,
walls, and moats.


2 In France during the Middle Ages, a style of defensive structure developed that was
called the motte and bailey castle. The motte and bailey castle became a common
structure for defense.


3 A motte and bailey castle was a strong wooden structure built on top of a manmade
hill called a motte. Wooden steps or a ramp connected the courtyard, or bailey, to
the motte. People removed
these walkways during a siege
to prevent enemies from
entering. Royals and nobles
sometimes lived in the part of
the structure which sat on top
of the motte. The bailey housed
and provided protection for
the people who served the
king or the noble. The bailey
was also a safe place in which
to keep animals and food
supplies. A high wooden wall
encircled the entire structure,

##### **Activity Books**

In Grades K–5, Activity Books allow students to practice and apply newly instructed skills while
strengthening those that require additional time to master. Activity Books foster distributed practice
so that students have multiple opportunities to strengthen skills. As an instructional tool, this
allows teachers to spiral back to skills as needed for individual students during implementation
of the program. Within Activity Books, activities
are designed to support students’ mastery of
the primary objective for each lesson. Therefore,
teachers should be using Activity Books as
formative opportunities to gauge students’
progression toward learning outcomes. Each
activity is intentionally designed to align with
learning objectives, with the main purpose of
enhancing students’ understanding and application
of essential skills through explicit practice.


Teachers should assign activity pages as needed
to provide additional instructional support or
acceleration based on students’ progression
toward mastery of objectives. Activities included
in the Activity Books are skills driven and aid in
comprehension, writing, response to texts, and
analysis of ideas or concepts.


**44** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


##### **Image Cards**

In Grades K–3, Image Cards are used to support students’ comprehension and development
of mental models. Images extend knowledge of a unit topic and connect ideas between texts
read aloud to students. Image Cards are beneficial for students that require additional language
acquisition skills and vocabulary development, including EB students.


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **45**


##### **Flip Books**

In Grades K–2, Flip Books are related to the Read-Aloud texts. Like Image Cards, the Flip Books
contain images that reflect the content in Read-Aloud texts and visually support listening
comprehension development. Flip Books include photographs, art images, maps, and graphs that
help build text connections, particularly when language gaps exist for students. Therefore, Flip
Books allow teachers to personalize learning for students using visual aids that provide equitable
access to the curriculum.

##### **Digital Components**


Digital Components are PDF documents that teachers can download to print or project and show
to students during lessons. Digital Components include charts, timelines, lists, and other resources
related to each lesson. In Grade 3 RLA units, these digital resources are referred to as Digital
Projections.


**46** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


##### **Fluency Supplements**

The Fluency Supplement is available in the program’s online materials. These supplements
accompany Grades 2–5. They consist of short poetry, fiction and nonfiction selections, and
Reader’s Theater.

These additional text selections provide opportunities for students to practice reading with fluency
and expression (prosody). A fluency rubric is included in the supplement to help track students’
progress toward fluent reading. For more information on implementation, along with the take-home
letter for families, please consult the supplement.


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **47**


##### **Essential Questions and Prompts**

In Grades 3–5, the Reading Language Arts units provide teachers with Essential Questions and
Prompts. This instructional tool supports students in reflecting on their learning across the
unit and can provide teachers the opportunity to gather student data and progress monitoring
students’ understanding. This tool can also be used to support a project-based or problem-solving
instructional model within the classroom.


The Essential Questions and Prompts can include:

- Unit-level guided questions

- Lesson-level guiding questions and writing prompts

- Text-specific guided questions at various levels of complexity

##### **Family Support Letters**

Family Support Letters are provided in English and Spanish with all RLA and Foundational Skills
units to connect learning between school and home. These letters provide families with guidance
on ways that students can practice skills taught within the unit in their home environment. Families
can support the progress of their students through the activities provided. Take-Home Activities
are also included throughout the Activity Books of most units to introduce families to new skills or
support them in practicing skills that have been taught previously in the unit.


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **49**


##### **Additional Support Resources**

The appendices in each Teacher Guide provide grade-level professional support and resources,
such as Blackline Masters and other lesson-related support documents. Unit overviews provide
context for each lesson taught within a unit.

Throughout the units, teachers will have the opportunity to use Pausing Point days to extend or
accelerate learning as needed. These days can be increased or decreased to accommodate local
school calendars. In addition to Pausing Point days, K–2 Reading Language Arts units include
Culminating Activities, Unit Reviews, and Assessments. While the program recommends a number
of days for each of these instructional activities, schools can make local decisions to extend or
condense the instructional days to meet the needs of their students.


Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts instructional materials also include
supplemental components, such as the K–5 Independent Reading Guide and Grade 2, Grade 3,
and Grades 4–5 Fluency Supplements. These resources can be used as additional opportunities
for core instruction, reteaching, or extensions as needed to support students in their growth and
development as readers.

### Supporting All Learners

##### **Students with Disabilities (SWD)**

The Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts Program supports access to instructional
materials for all learners, including scaffolding for students with disabilities. The Texas Vertical
Alignment documents have been reviewed in the formulation of units to ensure prior knowledge
has been considered as an entry point to the curriculum for diverse learners, including those
with identified physical and/or learning disabilities, whenever possible. Teachers of students with
disabilities should adhere to the Texas Education Agency Instructional Supports for Students with
Disabilities in the implementation of this literacy program. Tasks for Universal Access are included
in each lesson segment.

##### **Gifted/Talented (G/T) Students**


In accordance with the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students, the
Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts Program provides opportunities for students
to explore areas of interest within Knowledge units through guided and independent research.
Additionally, the learning experiences encourage advanced-level products and/or performance
tasks, such as those in the Texas Performance Standards Project (TPSP), whenever applicable.
Challenge tasks for all learners are included in each lesson segment. Teachers can consult the
sidebars within the units to find additional enrichment suggestions for G/T students within the
lessons.

##### **Emergent Bilingual (EB) Students**


In Texas, the EB population covers over 120 different native languages, and over 90 percent of
schools serve varying EB student populations. EB students may be at varying levels of proficiency,
depending on when they first began to learn English. Therefore, the English Language Proficiency
Standards (ELPS) are designed to support the ability of EB students to acquire the English
proficiency to be able to participate equally in an English instructional program with no secondlanguage acquisition supports across all subject areas.


The Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts Program is a set of Tier 1 instructional
materials that includes linguistic accommodations for EB students, with instruction that is
communicated, sequenced, and scaffolded commensurate with students’ English proficiency


**58** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


levels. In accordance with both TEKS and ELPS, this literacy program addresses appropriate
accommodations for EB students through vocabulary cognates, small-group instruction, visual
aids, summaries, and other modes of scaffolding. Please see the following table, as well as the
sidebar supports embedded in lessons across the program, for more information on how to
effectively implement Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts with EB students in
state-approved ESL programs. Teachers can consult the sidebars within the units to find additional
scaffolds for EB students within the lessons.

**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **59**


##### **Additional Cognates Strategies**

A cognate is a term denoting a word that shares a common linguistic origin, meaning, or spelling,
and sometimes even pronunciation, with a word in another language. Research suggests that nearly
40 percent of English vocabulary has cognates in Spanish. Facilitating students’ comprehension of
how to identify and utilize cognates serves as a bridge between their two languages. However, it’s
crucial to recognize that this linguistic connection isn’t automatic, and students require time and
practice to develop proficiency in leveraging cognates effectively.

##### **Cognate Selection Criteria**


Educators can select cognates in English and Spanish that are most useful and relevant for their EB
students. These criteria include:


1. Similarity in Spelling: Cognates often have similar spellings in both languages, making them
easy to recognize.
2. Similarity in Meaning: Cognates typically have related meanings in both languages,
although there may be slight differences in usage or connotation.
3. Similarity in Pronunciation: Cognates often have similar pronunciation in both languages,
although there may be differences in accent or emphasis.
4. Frequency of Use: Commonly used words are more likely to have cognates in both
languages.
5. Transparency: The relationship between the cognate and its counterpart in the other
language should be transparent and easily recognizable to language learners.

##### **Cognate Activities**


The following list offers teachers the flexibility to choose from different activities related to
cognates allowing for variety and adaptability in their instructional routines. These activities
promote students’ understanding and recognition of cognates, enhancing their language
proficiency and comprehension.


**60** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


**Cognate Wall Activity:**

    - Have students contribute cognates they encounter in their reading to a class cognate wall.

    - For each new cognate added, discuss its similarities and differences in both languages.

    - Guide students to use their knowledge of the word in their native language to aid in
understanding its English counterpart.


**Compare Cognates Exercise:**

    - Distribute a list of cognates to students and ask them to circle the letters that differ between
the English and Spanish words.

    - Lead students in pronouncing each English word, focusing on various sounds and intonation
patterns.


**Sort Cognates Activity:**

    - Provide students with a variety of cognates and ask them to identify patterns and sort the
words into categories.

    - Categories may include words spelled the same in both languages, words with predictable
spelling variations, and false cognates.


**False Cognates Discussion:**

    - Explain the concept of false cognates to students, highlighting words that are spelled and
pronounced similarly but have different meanings.

    - Have students pronounce both words and compare their meanings, discussing any potential
confusion.

##### **Cognate Activities**






|Step|Directions|

##### **Supports for EB Students**

For some students in Grades 4–5, there are critical areas that should be addressed promptly and
practiced regularly because the skills are primarily taught in lower grade levels. These skills focus
on print concepts, phonological awareness, and phonics/decoding. The strategies outlined in the
following table can be used to help students who need specific support in these areas.








|ELPS 2.B Recognize elements of the English sound system in newly acquired vocabulary such as long and short<br>vowels, silent letters, and consonant clusters.|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Strategy Examples|When to Use|Sample Routine|
|•	 Have students practice reading<br>vocabulary words aloud.

##### **EB Student Strategies According to Language** **Program Models**

Texas Bluebonnet Learning [TM] also offers Grades K–5 Spanish Reading Language Arts units that
feature authentic literature choices and literary transadaptation for bilingual students. These units
are focused on the same topics as the English units, and they undergo a careful process to adapt
them into Spanish, involving a spectrum of transadaptation, translation, and authentic text led by
native speakers from a variety of Spanish-speaking regions. The Spanish Reading Language Arts
units are available for use but have not yet been through the state Instructional Materials Review
and Approval (IMRA) process.


The following table shares suggestions for biliteracy strategies that can be incorporated into the
program and used with the instructional materials provided.


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **65**


### Program Models

In a 90/10 model, teachers may incorporate English skills practice and Flip Books or Image Cards
during oral language instructional blocks.



In 50/50 programs, English and Spanish teachers can alternate teaching units or divide lessons
across the unit so that students see content in both languages. In the 50/50 model, there are

##### **Family Involvement and Cultural Connections**

The Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts Program incorporates letters to families
explaining the unit overview. These letters encourage families to speak about unit themes and ask
students about new learning. Families can bring in background knowledge about the topics and
support the learning of content, vocabulary, and language development. While students explore
culturally rich topics and texts within the units, they can build connections at home with their
families.

##### **Language and Vocabulary Development**


Within the Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts Program, there is a continued
emphasis on knowledge coherence and vocabulary development. The supports embedded within
the lessons allow EB students the opportunity to build connections between content and their
home language. The vocabulary sections within the lessons list Spanish cognates that align to the
English vocabulary words. Students can build what they know about the content from one language
to another.


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **67**


### Assessments

The Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts Program assessments allow teachers to
gain critical information about student mastery of standards-based performance tasks. Through
the use of formative assessments embedded in the Grade K–5 lessons, teachers may adjust
instruction as needed to meet the diverse needs of learners. Assessments include the following
formats and are used to gauge student understanding and application of Skills and Knowledge
units.

##### **Daily Formative Assessments**


The daily formative assessments are aligned to each lesson and allow students to demonstrate
learning success on that day’s instruction. These assessments are completed either during
instructional time or as a home-extension and are located in the Activity Book. Formative
assessment strategies include Checks for
Understanding, delivered briefly during
instruction. Checks for Understanding allow
teachers to monitor progress on each primary
focus objective and adjust instruction as needed.
Strategic questioning of students should include
literal, inferential, and evaluative question types.
The use of literal, inferential, and evaluative
questioning allows teachers to examine students
for explicit and inferred information from texts
along with analytical application of skills.

##### **Mid-Unit Assessments**


The mid-unit assessments are embedded within some units to support teachers in progress
monitoring over the course of the unit and tailoring the remaining instructional time as needed.
These mid-unit assessments are accompanied by instructional materials, teacher implementation
directions, and supports for analyzing student performance. Additional Pausing Point days within


**68** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


the units give teachers the opportunity to reteach or provide additional instructional support in
small groups or 1:1 following the performance analysis.


**Unit Assessments**
Unit assessments offer summative assessment of students’ comprehension of the Knowledge
units. These assessments, which typically take one instructional period, include support for
analysis of errors and assessment charts to record student progress. These assessments are


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **69**


**Spelling Assessments**
Spelling assessments are provided for Grades 1–5. They are embedded within the units. Spelling
analysis sheets are provided in Teacher Guides to support teachers in assessing student progress
across the spelling patterns taught.

##### **Writing Assessments**


The writing assessment directly aligns with the knowledge-building of the unit. Students learn
explicit writing skills across the unit and respond to a writing prompt that aligns to the content/
topic of the unit. Writing rubrics are provided in Teacher Guides to support teachers in assessing
student progress across the writing genre.

##### **STAAR-Aligned Question Types**


In Grades 3–5, STAAR-aligned questions are embedded into the instructional materials. Students
will also have an opportunity to engage in STAAR-aligned writing tasks, as well as interact with
writing rubrics that provide clear guidance for achieving end-of-year expectations. These can be
found within the following locations:


- the comprehension questions

- the Guided Reading supports

- the Exit Tickets

- part of the activity page

- in some print and digital end-of-unit assessments


These question types can include hot text, multipart, multiple select, inline choice, short
constructed response, and extended constructed response.


For more information on the STAAR question types, visit the Texas Education Agency website.

**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **71**


##### **Other Suggested Assessment Tools**

In addition to the assessment resources provided within the instructional materials, it is also
recommended to support students in tracking their own data using progress monitoring tools. A
student progress record form may be used to track how individual students are progressing over
time. Students can set individualized goals for growth and monitor their progress across various
assessment forms.


Below are two Student-Tracking examples. Teachers can also use the Smart Goal planning
documents (AR 9.1, 9.2) and the Reading Reflection forms (AR 15.2, 15.2) in the Independent
Reading Guide.

### QTI Assessment Guidance

Question & Test Interoperability Assessments, or QTI Assessments, are digitally implemented
in Grades K–5 to measure students’ independent application of literacy skills. In Grades K–2,
assessments are designed to evaluate listening comprehension and vocabulary through audiobased passages and items. In Grades 3–5, reading comprehension, vocabulary, grammar, and
morphology are assessed through independent reading of passages and related questions.


Across grade levels, reading passages include the knowledge and associated vocabulary in
the units taught to students. Each assessment item has an objective that is designed to gauge
students’ mastery of the TEKS, with items that reflect a range of Depth of Knowledge (DOK) levels.
The assessments increase in complexity and length to mirror knowledge building as students
progress through instruction. End-of-unit (EOU) assessments are administered at the end of each
unit to help teacher analyze data and respond to students’ needs. There are digital assessments
for all units except the K-5 research units and the novel study units in Grades 4 and 5, as these units
are not pedagogically aligned to the framework of the QTI assessments.


QTI files can only be viewed and administered once they have been ingested into a Learning
Management System. It is recommended that administrators select either the print or QTI
Assessment method for students. Students should not take both assessment types at the end of a
unit.


Guidelines for accommodating QTI Assessments for students may include but are not limited to
reducing the number of questions, providing breaks, taking a portion of the test and completing the
remaining items later, or any other accommodation that align to a student’s IEP, 504, and/or other
accommodation plan.

##### **Administration**


QTI assessments have an approximate administration time frame of 45–50 minutes, or an
individual class period. During the test administration, teachers and administrators can expect the
following QTI Assessment components by grade band.


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **73**


**Grades K–2:**
Students are administered an audio-based reading passage, based on the knowledge in the
unit, that they are hearing for the first time.
Images related to the passage are visible for students as they listen.
Students answer questions that are read aloud.
Questions include multiple choice.


**Grades 3–5:**
Students independently read a passage, based on the knowledge in the unit, that they are
reading for the first time.
Students read and answer questions independently.
Questions include multiple choice and other STAAR-aligned item types.
##### **Descriptions of Items**


**Multiple Choice**
The student will choose the correct answer from a set of possible answer choices.

**Multiple Select**
The student will choose the correct answer(s) from a set of possible answer choices.


**Short Constructed Response**
Reading: The student will give a brief explanation in their own words to demonstrate understanding.
Writing: The student will demonstrate proficiency in the skill by constructing a sentence that
corrects a revising or editing error.


**Extended Constructed Response**
The student will write an in-depth response by explaining, analyzing, and evaluating information
provided in a reading selection or stimulus.


**Hot Text**
The student selects highlighted text in a sentence, paragraph, or selection.


**74** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


**Inline Choice**
The student selects the correct answer from a drop-down menu.


**Multipart**
The student responds to a two-part question where Part A and B are scored separately. Part B asks
students to choose the answer that provides text evidence for the answer in Part A.

##### **Item Scoring**


The items on QTI Assessments have one of the following scoring systems assigned, based on the
question type.


**1.** **Exact Match:** The item has only one correct answer option; for example, a multiple-choice
question, an inline-choice question, or a hot text with only one correct option. The student
receives the full credit of 1 point for each correct exact match question.


**2.** **Partial Match per Response:** The item requires multiple answers to be chosen correctly for the
student to receive the full credit of 1 point. For example, in a multiple-select item with two correct
answers for the full credit of 1 point, a student earns 0.5 points for each correct answer.


**3.** **Written Response:** Short constructed responses—reading are scored on a 2-point rubric, and
extended constructed responses are scored on a 10-point rubric. Short constructed responses—
revising and editing are worth 1 point.


Data results for teacher and administrator reports are contingent upon the platform used by the
district or school to administer the QTI Assessments. QTI Assessment Guides are provided with the
unit materials. Teachers can print the guides or view them online to see the assessment passages,
items, and answer keys. These can be analyzed during the unit internalization process referenced in
the Program Implementation Guidance section.


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **75**


### Program Implementation Guidance

For a comprehensive understanding of the instructional materials provided by the Bluebonnet
Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts Program, professional development resources for teachers,
coaches, and administrators are provided.


These materials include internalization protocols that support educators using the program in
effectively implementing and using the high-quality instructional materials (HQIM) provided.


Internalization is the process of deeply studying a unit or lesson from your HQIM to understand
what students are expected to learn and how you will teach it to achieve those outcomes. The
internalization of HQIM is different from traditional “planning” and enables teachers to utilize
their expertise and creativity more effectively to engage and differentiate for all students. HQIM
internalization helps to ensure that all students get access to rigorous and engaging grade-level
content. It also improves the quality of differentiation and in-the-moment support that students
receive. The goal of internalization is to provide equitable instruction and student success. Because
it is critical for teachers to learn and internalize their HQIM effectively, the Texas Educational
Agency has provided the following materials to support all administrators, teachers, and coaches
in facilitating meaningful learning experiences with the grade-level content provided within the
Bluebonnet Learning [TM] K–5 Reading Language Arts Program.


This includes unit-level internalization where teachers and coaches engage in a step-by-step
process for understanding each unit prior to teaching, including what students will be learning, how
students will be assessed, and the high-level arc of learning. By starting with unit internalization,
teachers see how each lesson fits into the big picture prior to using the Lesson Internalization
Protocol.


Unit-level internalization documents:

    - K–2 Reading Language Arts Unit Internalization for Teachers

    - K–3 Foundational Skills Unit Internalization for Teachers

    - 3–5 Unit Internalization for Teachers

    - K–2 Reading Language Arts Unit Internalization for Coaches

    - K–3 Foundational Skills Unit Internalization for Coaches

    - 3–5 Unit Internalization for Coaches


**76** **Program and Implementation Guide** **Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts**


**Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts** **Program and Implementation Guide** **77**


Following the unit internalization, teachers will engage in the lesson internalization. The Lesson
Internalization Protocol is the process by which teachers understand what students will learn
in a specific lesson, how students will be assessed, and how teachers will make decisions about
how to teach the lesson and support all students to be successful. The Lesson Internalization
Protocol builds on the understanding of the overall unit developed as part of the Unit Internalization
Protocol.

In addition to these resources, is the
Observation Tool. The Observation
tool is a resource for coaches and/or
administrators to document specific
look-fors while observing teachers’
instruction and implementation of highquality instructional materials. This is not
an evaluative tool, but rather a support
for coaches and/or administrators to
collect observable data. Coaches and/or
administrators can use the data collected
to develop individualized coaching plans
for teachers or grade-level teams. The
data may also be used to develop campuswide or district-wide professional learning
sessions as needed.
