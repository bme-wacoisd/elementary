This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 1. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. Teachers will explain these activity
pages to the students orally, using the instructions in the Teacher Guide. There are also instructions
on the activity pages for students to read themselves. The Activity Book is a student component,
which means each student should have an Activity Book.

**Heroes**


One sunny morning, as Emma and Jack were enjoying their
breakfast, they heard a loud sound. It was the wail of a siren! Startled,
they raced to the window and looked outside. What they saw was a
magnificent sight: a red fire truck speeding down the street with its
lights flashing and its sirens blaring.


“Let’s go see what’s happening!” Emma exclaimed. Jack nodded.
They slipped on their sneakers and ran out the door. Their hearts
were pounding with excitement.


As they got closer, the reason for the rush was clear. The fire truck
stopped suddenly near a house with smoke swirling out the windows.
Brave firefighters ran out. They were dressed in sturdy helmets and
heavy coats. They sprang into action.


The smell of smoke was strong. The air felt warm as Emma and
Jack watched from their side of the road.


Emma and Jack saw firefighters holding the hose, directing the
water toward the flames. They were amazed, unable to look away
from the brave scene in front of them.

As the smoke cleared, a kind-hearted firefighter walked toward the
children. “Don’t worry. We’re here to help. Everyone will be okay,” he
reassured them with a calm voice.


After one hour of intense effort, the firefighters put out the fire.
They checked every corner of the house. They did not want the fire
to start again. They got into their truck, smiled, and waved goodbye
to Emma and Jack.


After seeing what happened, Emma and Jack looked at each other.
“We want to be firefighters too,” they said at once. They wanted to be
protectors in their community, just like the firefighters who had saved
the day.

**The Scavenger Hunt**


Amy and her little sister Addy woke up excited. Today was the
neighborhood scavenger hunt. They couldn’t wait.


“Are you ready for the scavenger hunt?” asked Addy.


“I am!” replied Amy, with a big smile on her face. “Let’s work
together as a team!”


The sisters put on their sneakers and ran outside. They joined the
other kids at the park.


The park was starting to fill up as the neighborhood children
arrived. Mrs. Jenkins, the neighborhood librarian, organized the
event. She gave each team a map and their first clue. The clues led to
different locations in the neighborhood.


“Good luck, everyone!” Mrs. Jenkins cheered. The teams ran off.


Amy and Addy looked at the map and read the first clue. “It says,
‘Find the big tree with a red ribbon. Look at the roots for your next
clue!’”

Excitedly, they ran toward the park’s large oak tree. They spotted
a red ribbon. It was tied around one of the tree’s thick roots. Amy
carefully lifted the ribbon and found a small note tucked underneath.
Clue number 2!


“It’s a riddle!” exclaimed Addy. She read it out loud. “It says, ‘I
have many keys but no locks. I can be played, but I am not a game.
What am I?’”


Amy’s eyes lit up. “It’s a piano! Mr. Garcia has an old piano! Let’s
go to his house.”


The sisters hurried to Mr. Garcia’s house. He was waiting at his
front door. They went inside. On the piano was the next clue. This
clue led them to the community garden. They had to solve a puzzle
hidden in the flowers. They worked together to solve it.


There were more clues and exciting discoveries. Then the girls
finally reached the last location. It was the old park bench near the
big fountain. They looked under the bench. They found a small chest.
It was filled with colorful candies and shiny coins!


“We did it!” exclaimed Addy, beaming with joy. They returned
to Mrs. Jenkins. The other teams returned with chests too. Everyone
celebrated and laughed. They shared their adventures and favorite
moments.


“We make the best team ever!” Amy said, hugging her little sister.


Addy nodded happily. “I can’t wait for the next scavenger hunt!”

**Take-Home**



It is exciting to start the school year—a warm welcome to
you and your student! This letter is to tell you about the
reading program your student will be using this year. The
program is an innovative set of instructional materials.


This program consists of systematic and explicit instruction
of the Foundational Skills strand of the 3rd-grade Texas
Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) standards, including
reading, spelling, and reinforcing cursive handwriting.


The thirty-minute Skills lessons use a phonics-based
approach to teach the mechanics for reading and spelling.
The program addresses the TEKS standards related to
foundational skills and is designed to complement any other
TEKS-aligned curriculum.


During the early days of school, we will review the skills
taught in Grade 2. This review period will also give us the
opportunity to get to know your student better so we can
identify his or her areas of strength and weakness in reading
and spelling. It is important that we determine exactly what
level of instruction is most appropriate for your student.

We will be observing and assessing your student during
these first few weeks to be sure that he or she is placed at
the appropriate level of instruction. Your student will use
the instructional materials most appropriate for his or her
learning needs. You will soon begin to see more examples of
classwork and homework regularly.


We recognize the importance of parents being involved in
the education of their student. If you would like information
on ways to help your student at home, please do not
hesitate to contact me. I look forward to teaching your
student this year as we continue using this program in our
Grade 3 classes.

**Practice with VC/V Syllable Pattern**



Dear Family Member,


Your student has been practicing with VC/V syllable
patterns.


VC/V stands for Vowel, Consonant, Vowel. The word _robin_ is
an example of the syllable pattern VC/V. The first syllable is
_rob_ and the second syllable is _in_ . Within the first syllable, the
letters ‘o’ and ‘b’ are the VC. Within the second syllable the
letter ‘i’ is the V. Between those letters is where the syllable
will be divided.


Color the vowel in each word’s syllable red. Color the
consonant between the two vowels blue. Circle the closed
syllable. Underline the open syllable. Write each word neatly
in cursive. Draw a line to the picture that matches each
word.


**Remember:** If the first vowel sound is short, it is a closed
syllable.

patterns in class. There a few different syllable division
patterns including VC/CV which is a word that has two
vowel sounds with two consonants in between. The VC/CV
syllables are divided between the consonants. The VC/V
pattern has a syllable that ends with a consonant (closed
syllable). The closed syllable creates a short vowel sound.

**Unit 1 Fluency Assessment**


Read aloud the text below.


**The Baseball Game**


Jack was an athlete. He loved sports, but mostly he loved baseball.
He was an ambitious third-grade boy with big dreams. He wanted
to be the best baseball player in the world. It did not matter what
the weather was. It could be rainy or sunny. Jack would go outside to
practice. He would throw the ball high in the air to practice catching.
He would toss a ball up and hit it out of the air to practice batting.
Jack would even ask his dad to time him as he sprinted around the
house to build speed as a runner.


On Saturday, Jack’s team, the Lions, had a big game against their
team rivals, the Falcons. Jack knew it would be a tough game. Jack’s
coach said the Lions needed to play their best if they wanted to win.
Before the game started, Jack sat on the bench. He could hear the
crowd. They were already cheering loudly.


It was Jack’s turn. He grabbed his baseball bat and walked up to
home plate. The pitcher threw a fastball. It came at Jack so fast he
could hear it cutting through the air. Jack swung at the pitch. The
ball made a loud crack as it hit the bat. It flew through the air over
the head of the outfielder. Jack ran fast and made it to third base. His
hit allowed the three other runners on the bases to score. Jack’s team
was jumping up and down. The crowd was screaming.

Now, it was the Falcons’ turn to bat. The Falcons only needed
one run to tie the game and two runs to win. The first batter struck
out. The second batter hit a double and made it to second base. The
third batter was tagged out on first base. The fourth batter stepped up
to the plate. The Lions had to get him out. If he scored a home run,
the Lions would lose. Jack stood in the outfield, ready. He looked to
the stands and gave his dad a thumbs-up. He kissed his baseball mitt
for good luck. The batter struck the ball hard. Jack ran back, and he
caught it! Jack’s team won the game! Jack was a hero.


The Lions won a trophy for winning the game. Because Jack had
made the winning catch, the team wanted Jack to hold the trophy for
the team picture!
