##### **Special Sound ar**

Dear Family Member,


Your student is learning about the special sound _ar_ in words.
There are two sounds _ar_ can make: /ar/ and /er/. Please
help them find the _ar_ in each bolded word and circle it. Then,
they should read the sentences and write the word with _ar_
under the column that fits the _ar_ sound in the word. Look
at the example, which uses the word _carnival_ . Your student
would circle the _ar_ and listen to what _ar_ sound it is making
in the word. If it sounds like the /ar/ in carpool, they would
write carnival under /ar/ carpool. If it sounds like /er/ in
scholar, they would write carnival under /er/ scholar. Write
each word neatly in cursive.

Marcus was an boy who liked to build
gadgets and design things in his free time. One day, he
created a small robot that could help carry books. He
made it look very by giving it shiny blue paint
and flashing lights. His friends thought his creation
was very because it was not easy to build
something like that. For the school science fair, Marcus decided to
display his robot. He was very busy and at the
fair, demonstrating many times how the robot worked and explaining
its design to everyone passing by. The judges were impressed by how
Marcus made something so useful and complex. He won a special
award for being and using his imagination to
make something new.

Read aloud the text below.

##### **The Carnival**


Juan and Julia, two close friends, were excited as they spotted the big
carnival scene in their town. The carnival came for one week each year,
bringing thrilling rides, vibrant games, and delicious treats.


When Juan and Julia arrived at the carnival, an enchanting array of
rides greeted them.


Juan said excitedly, “Let’s go!”


Although Julia didn’t love big, fast rides, she did not want to show any
fear. So, she paused briefly before she softly responded, “Okay.”


They began their carnival adventure on some smaller rides, which
Julia liked more. As she felt more comfortable, they gradually worked
their way up to bigger and faster rides. By the end of the day, they had
conquered all the rides, filling the air with laughter and joy.


After they rode the rides, they treated themselves to cotton candy
and popcorn and shared a big sandwich. As they ate, they watched
people juggle, dance, and sing. Their applause rang loudly through
the carnival grounds.


It was getting dark outside, signaling the end of the day. Juan and Julia
were going to go home; however, upon spotting an enticing array of

games, they couldn’t resist. They wanted to play a few games before
the carnival closed for the night. Julia tried her luck at throwing darts
at balloons while Juan squirted water at rubber ducks. They both took
turns throwing bean bags into holes and basketballs into nets. They
were eager to score as many points as possible to win as many prizes as
possible.


Finally, it was time for Juan and Julia to leave. They walked out of the
carnival carrying stuffed animals, toys, and sweets they had won from
the games. They already couldn’t wait to visit the carnival next year!
