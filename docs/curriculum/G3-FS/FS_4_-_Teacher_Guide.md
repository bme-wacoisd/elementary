**Grade 3 | Foundational Skills 4**
##### Introduction


~~**UNIT 4 OVERVIEW**~~


This unit introduces several new skills that students will revisit or build upon in later units. It begins
with the introduction of common vowel teams representing long vowel sounds, moves to prefixes
and suffixes, and ends with homophones. Developing these foundational skills is essential to
students’ proficient reading of multisyllabic words and reading comprehension.


Students will first work on decoding and encoding multisyllabic words with the vowel teams _ee_ / _ea_,
_ai_ / _ay_, and _ue_ . In these lessons, students will apply knowledge of long vowel sounds to new
multisyllabic words.


Students will then work with the prefixes _un_ –, _dis_ –, _mis_ –, _re_ –, and _pre_  - as well as the suffixes – _ist_
and – _ian_ . Students will learn how these affixes change the meaning of base words. They will also
learn that affixes add a syllable to the base word and often change the part of speech as well. As
they complete oral and written exercises in this unit, students will have opportunities to apply their
new knowledge of how the meanings change when an affix is applied.


Finally, students will identify, use, and explain the meaning of homophones, as well as practice
spelling homophones. Learning and understanding the meanings of homophones is an important
part of vocabulary and spelling development.


~~**TRICKY SPELLINGS**~~


As new spellings are introduced, some complexity is added to the reading process. Some of the
spelling units that students have to process are ambiguous in the sense that they can stand for
more than one sound. These ambiguous spellings are called “tricky spellings.” In Unit 4, instruction
focuses on vowel teams. Students build on this concept by examining how a vowel suffix, especially
when attached to a base word that ends in a vowel, changes the spelling of the base word.


**TRICKY WORDS & HIGH-FREQUENCY WORDS**


Tricky Words are introduced in this unit on an as-needed basis in the context of the different
selections included in the Reader. Tricky Words should be taught in the lessons before the reading
selections are assigned. When introducing Tricky Words, be sure to draw attention to the parts read
(and spelled) just as students would expect based on what they have learned so far and also point
out the tricky parts of each word.


Introduction
**1**


**2**



The Tricky Words taught in this unit are:


 - Lesson 1 - _adventure_


 - Lesson 5 - _lifeguard_


 - Lesson 6 - _delicious_


 - Lesson 8 - _library_


In addition to addressing Tricky Words and tricky spellings, this program emphasizes the reading
and spelling of high-frequency words, carefully selected from word lists compiled by researchers
Edward William Dolch and Edward Fry. The selection of these words was based on their prevalence
within the unit Reader, and instruction is integrated into lessons at points where students will
naturally encounter these words within the assigned sections of the Readers.


The curriculum includes a structured approach for teaching high-frequency words, starting with
the introduction of 8–12 keywords at the beginning of each unit, selected for their relevance and
frequency in the unit’s text. Words are introduced using phonetic sounding and Spelling Cards for
decoding. Throughout the unit, these words are reviewed in various contexts, including through
decode/encode games and fluency checkpoints to assess automaticity and fluency. This ensures
that students engage with the words multiple times, enhancing their reading skills and confidence.


The high-frequency words taught in this unit are:


 - Lesson 1 – _always_, _sometimes_


 - Lesson 2 – said, _something_


 - Lesson 3 – _idea_


 - Lesson 5 – _fall_


 - Lesson 7 – _draw_, _paper_


 - Lesson 9 – _never_ _last_


 - Lesson 12 – _today_


~~**READER:**~~ ~~**FRANKIE FIGURES IT OUT**~~


_Frankie Figures It Out_ is a story about a young girl named Frankie who learns the importance of
rules. Initially, Frankie finds rules confusing, whether it’s not climbing up a slide at the park or being
told not to run at the zoo. She and her mother spend a day being Rules Detectives, looking for all
the ways that rules guide our daily lives. Throughout the day, Frankie experiences various situations,
from nearly getting hurt at a swimming pool to understanding the need for order in a library and
at her mom’s office. These experiences teach her the purpose of rules in ensuring safety, fairness,
and organization. By the end of the day, Frankie realizes that rules are essential for a safe and
harmonious society.

~~**UNIT 4 ASSESSMENT**~~


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


Throughout this unit, formative assessments are clearly marked for monitoring individual student
performance and progress in key skills. Quick Checks for Understanding to evaluate overall
classroom performance are also designated in each lesson. Fluency practice takes place regularly
throughout the unit. Records for recording student performance in an Anecdotal Reading Record,
Grade 3 Foundational Skills Record, Grade 3 Fluency Record, and Grade 3 End-of-Year Summary are
included in the Teacher Resources.


**Student Performance Assessment**


The target words in each of these assessments include the vowel sound/spellings taught in this
unit; distractors have been intentionally selected because they represent frequent sound/spelling
confusions. Student performance on these assessments is a good indicator of whether students
have mastered the new sound/spellings.


In Lessons 14 and 15, you will be prompted to administer a multipart end-of-unit assessment. In the
first part, you will work one-on-one with students to complete the Fluency Assessment. Students
will engage in a review activity while awaiting their turn for the assessment. The Reading and
Spelling portion of the assessment takes place during the first 20 minutes of the second lesson.
Once students have completed the assessment, they will have time for Self-Sustained Reading.
Use time in this lesson to finish working with students who still need to complete the Fluency
Assessment in the previous lesson.


~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice Unit 4 skills can be found in the
Pausing Point section included after the last lesson. It is strongly recommended that you pause for
one day and provide targeted acceleration for individual or groups of students in any areas in which
they require supplementation based on the Student Performance Assessment.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available in the program’s online materials. This
component has been designed to complement the unit. It consists of poetry, folklore, and fables.
These additional text selections provide opportunities for students to practice reading with fluency
and prosody (expression), indicated by the anecdotal records, as well as a way to track progress from
unit to unit. See the Unit 1 introduction or directions in the Fluency Supplement for further guidance.

~~**TEKS 3.2.A.ii; TEKS 3.2.B.i; TEKS 3.2.D**~~


~~**REVIEW VOWEL TEAMS EE AND EA (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Explain that this unit begins with a review of some long vowel sounds and some
of the vowel teams that make those sounds. Ask: What do you know about long
vowel sounds and vowel teams? _(Long vowel sounds are pronounced the way_
_we pronounce the name of the vowel like /oe/ for letter ‘o’, and vowel teams are_
_two vowels written together and create one long sound.)_


    - Provide the sentence frame: Long vowel sounds are _______. Vowel teams
_______.


    - Confirm to students that a long vowel is pronounced like the name of the
vowel sound represented. This lesson focuses on the sound /ee/ for long ‘e.’


    - Display the following sentence: The chef, known for his seasonal cuisine,
exceeded expectations by using greenery from his garden, repeatedly
impressing diners with fresh flavors.


    - Prompt students to turn and talk: Which words in the sentence have the
long ‘e’ vowel sound? What vowel teams in those words represent the
long ‘e’ sound? _(ea_ : _seasonal, repeatedly;_ ee: _exceeded, greenery)_


    - In English, eight spellings can make the /ee/ sound; however, this unit
focuses on just two spellings: _ee_ and _ea_ .


    - Display the Spelling Cards for /ee/ > _ea_ ( _beach_ ) and /ee/ > _ee_ ( _bee_ ).
Direct students to find the /ee/ and /ea/ sounds on their Individual Code
Charts and outline each code.


    - Ask students to whisper read each word, _beach_ and _bee_, into a cupped
hand. Point out that _ee_ always makes the /ee/ sound.


    - Write the words _beak_, _break_, and _bread_ on the board. Direct students to
read the words aloud in unison as you point to each one. Underline the _ea_
in each word.


    - Ask: What different vowel sound does the _ea_ make in each word? _(The_ _ea_
_in_ beak _makes the /ee/ sound. The_ ea _in_ break _makes the /ay/ sound. The_
_ea_ _in_ bread _makes the /e/ sound.)_


**TEKS 3.2.A.ii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open
syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables;
**TEKS 3.2.B.i** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by spelling multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open
syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables;
**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.


Foundational Skills 4


   - Explain that the vowel team _ea_ can be unpredictable because of the three
sounds that the team can make. There is no rule for which spelling pattern
is used to make the long _e_ sound. As they read more and with practice,
students will learn which words are spelled with which vowel team.


   - Make a two-column chart on the board. Label one column _ee_ and one
column _ea_ .


   - Write _meet_, _bees_, _deep_ in the _ee_ column. Direct students to read the words
aloud in unison as you point to each one. Underline the _ee_ in each word.


   - Add to the words so that they become _meeting_, _beeswax_, and _deepen_ .
Direct students to read the words aloud in unison as you point to each
one, clapping the syllables. Point out that the /ee/ sound does not change
when additional syllables are added.


   - Write _seal_, _peat_, _deal_ in the _ea_ column. Direct students to read the words
aloud in unison as you point to each one. Underline the _ea_ in each word.


   - Add to the words so that they become _unseal_, _repeat_, and _dealing_ . Direct
students to read the words aloud in unison as you point to each one, clapping
the syllables. Point out that, as with _ee_, the /ee/ sound does not change when
additional syllables are added to words that include _ea_ to make this sound.


   - Tell students to think of as many multisyllabic words as they can that
have the /ee/ sound and are spelled with either _ea_ or _ee_ and write
them down in cursive to share with the class. Suggest to students that
if they think of a single syllable word, they can add an affix to make it a
multisyllabic word.


   - Set a timer for two minutes, and circulate around the room. Offer
feedback such as:


   - “Check that your loops and tails are formed smoothly and connect to
the next letter.”


   - “Great job forming the letter ‘e’! I like how you started at the bottom
and made a smooth, curved line.”


   - After a couple of minutes, invite students to share their words and add it
to the chart.


~~**PRACTICE WITH DICTATION (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students open to Activity Page 1.1.


 - Explain that they will listen as you say each word once, repeat the word, and
write the word. Direct students to complete responses neatly in cursive.


 - For the first group of words, in the left column, explain that the /ee/ sound is
made by the _ea_ spelling pattern. Dictate words: _repeated_, _nearby_, _teacher_ .

- Explain that _Frankie Figures It Out_ contains many high-frequency words.
These are common words, so they will come across them often as they
read, in both the Reader and in many different texts. Explain that learning
to recognize these words and how to spell them will improve their overall
reading and writing fluency.


- Display this lesson’s high-frequency words: _always_ and _sometimes_ . Focus on
the word _always_ . Ask where the syllables should be divided, then draw a line
to divide the two syllables, al/ways. Say the syllables as you clap them, then
have students repeat in unison.


- Point out that the first ‘a’ is in front of an ‘l’. Remind students that three previous
high-frequency words— _small_, _talk_, and _walk_ —had _al_ spellings. Ask: When ‘a’
comes right before ‘l’ within a word, what sound does the ‘a’ make? _(/aw/)_


- Point to the second syllable. Ask: What letters make the vowel sound in this
syllable? _(_ ay _makes the /ae/_ sound. _)_


- Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves: /aw/ /l/ /w/ /ae/ /z/. For
additional support, display the Spelling Cards for each sound.


- Focus on the word _sometimes_ . Ask where the syllables should be divided,
then draw a line to divide the two syllables, some/times. Say the syllables
as you clap them, then have students repeat in unison. Point out that this is
a compound word, made up of two words.


- Ask: What syllable pattern do these syllables seem to follow? _(Each syllable_
_seems to have a VCe syllable pattern.)_


- Point to the first syllable, and state that _some_ is pronounced /s/ /u/ /m/,
not /s/ /oe/ /m/ as the VCe pattern would indicate. _Some_ is a word that
students will encounter on its own and as a word part; the more often they
read and spell it, the more fluent they will become with its spelling.


- Point to the second syllable, and state that _times_ does follow the expected
VCe pattern, with the silent ‘e’ making the ‘i’ have the long vowel sound.


- Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves: /s/ /u/ /m/ /t/ /ie/ /m/ /z/. For
additional support, display the Spelling Cards for each sound.


- Clarify the meanings of _always_ and _sometimes_ as needed. Point out that
_always_ sounds like “all ways,” even though it’s not a true compound word.
Split _sometimes_ into the two words that make this compound word, and
discuss that _some_ means “not all”, so _sometimes_ can mean “not all of the
times.” Review that both words indicate how often or the extent to which
something is done or experienced.


Foundational Skills 4


- Write the word _beneath_ on the board. Ask students if they know how to
pronounce this word and what it means. Ask if anyone can anyone use it in
a sentence.


- What is the vowel team in this word? _(ea)_ What sound does the team make?
_(/ee/)_


- Clap the syllables: be/neath.


- Remind students that most English words _play by the rules_, meaning they
are pronounced and spelled as we would expect. There are a few words that
do not play by the rules, including some very common and important ones.
Words that do not play by the rules (i.e., words not pronounced and spelled
as expected) are called Tricky Words.


- Display the Tricky Word _adventure_, read it aloud, and use it in a sentence.


- Point out which parts of the word are regular and can be blended as you
would expect and which parts are not regular and will either be taught later
or simply must be remembered.


- Have a student point out which parts of the word are regular and can be
blended as you would expect and which parts are not regular and will either
be taught later or simply must be remembered.


  - Tricky Word: _adventure_


    - Expected: /a/, /d/, /v/, /e/, /n/


    - Tricky: The letters _tu_ are pronounced /ch/, and the letters _re_ are
pronounced /er/.


- Explain that some words are spelled the same but pronounced differently
depending on the sentence. Write the word _read_ on the board, and ask
students to pronounce it. Some students may notice that there are two ways
to pronounce it (as _red_ or _reed_ ). Ask how do you know which one is right?


- Direct students to the following sentence in the Reader, or write it on the
board: “She and Cal played together on the jungle gym while her dad read
a book under a tree nearby.” Read it aloud, and ask students what type of
sound the _ea_ vowel team should make in this sentence. Why? _(Because the_
_story is in the past tense.)_


- Prompt students to think about the title of this unit’s Reader, _Frankie Figures_
_It Out_ .


- Turn to a partner to discuss the prompts: What would you say you always have
“figured out,” and what would you say you sometimes have “figured out”?

 - Provide strategic prompts to student partners to discuss and check
for comprehension as well as to check for their ability to use context to
determine the meaning of unfamiliar or multiple-meaning words. Have
students listen actively and ask relevant questions to clarify any information
from the Reader or strategic prompts. Example prompts include:


1. **Inferential:** Based on what you have read so far, what is Frankie’s main
problem? _(She is too busy being curious; she does not stay focused; she_
_forgets to do things.)_


2. **Evaluative:** What do Frankie’s words and actions reveal about her
character? _(She is forgetful because she forgot to do her chores; she has a_
_brother named Cal that she likes to run and play with; she is very active; she_
_raced between the poles, and sprinted up the slide)._


3. **Literal:** Which sentence from the story shows that Frankie forgets things?
_(Oops, I forgot.)_ What things did Frankie forget? _(chores, following the_
_playground rules)_


 - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their response.
Provide sentence stems as needed such as:


   - I think Frankie’s main problem is ...


   - Frankie’s actions show that she is...


   - One sentence that shows Frankie forgets things is...


   - Frankie forgets things like...


~~**WRAP UP (5 MIN.)**~~

~~**MORE HELP WITH EE AND EA**~~


  - Provide a variety of words that contain the _ee_ and _ea_ vowel teams on
individual index cards, such as _leak_, _eagle_, _stream_, _cheese_, _week_ and _keep_ .
Ask students to think of creative categories in which to sort the words
without sharing what characteristic they used to distinguish the words. Have
them share their groupings, and have a partner guess what the defining
characteristic is for their group of words. For example, the words _eagle_ and
_stream_ might be grouped in the category “Things Found in Nature.”


~~**WORD SORT**~~


  - Provide students with Word Sort Activity Page found in the Teacher
Resources, and read the Word Sort directions.


  - Point out that the first two words are already sorted. Ask students to circle
the part of each word that has _ee_ or _ea_ spelling.


  - Ask students to work through the Word Bank with a partner, reading each
word before adding it to the correct column on their Activity Page.


  - Remind students to complete responses in cursive.


  - Direct students to complete the final question independently for which they
write one sentence using both an _ee_ and _ea_ word.


  - Challenge students to write a story using at least four words, including two _ee_
and two _ea_ words. Tell them to be creative, and it’s fine to write a silly or goofy
story if they do their best to use the chosen words correctly.

Write _painfully_ and _rainfall_ under the _ai_ column. Write _entryway_ under the
_ay_ column. Direct students to read the words aloud in unison.


   - Write the following sentence on the board: I met an acquaintance while
we were enjoying the entertainment on Saturday.


   - Ask students to identify the words with the /ae/ sounds spelled with _ai_ or
_ay_ . Circle the words as they are identified.


   - Ask students to identify to which column each word should be added.
Write _acquaintance_ and _entertainment_ under the _ai_ column. Write
_Saturday_ under the _ay_ column. Direct students to read the words aloud in
unison.


   - Prompt students to Turn-and-Talk: What do you notice about where the _ai_
vowel team is located in the _ai_ words on the chart? _(It is in the middle of_
_the words or syllables.)_

_ay_ words on the chart? _(It is at the end of the words or syllables.)_


   - Ask students to share additional words that contain the /ae/ sound and
add them to the appropriate column. If students share words with the
/ae/ sound that do not use either of these vowel teams, consider adding
an Odd Duck column to capture the words.

- Explain that students will examine a new high-frequency word. Remind them
that these are common words that they will come across often as they read
and write. Display this lesson’s high-frequency word: _something_ .


- Ask where the syllables should be divided, then draw a line to divide the two
syllables, some/thing. Say the syllables as you clap them, then have students
repeat in unison. Point out that this is a compound word, made up of two words.


- Remind students that in the previous lesson, they learned a similar highfrequency word: _sometimes_ . Review that _some_ is pronounced /s/ /u/ /m/,
not /s/ /oe/ /m/ as the VCe pattern would indicate.


- Focus on the second syllable. Ask: What do you notice about the
consonants? _(The consonants are in pairs.)_ Circle the letters _th_, and remind
them that they have already learned that ‘t’ and ‘h’ work together to form the
consonant digraph _th_, which has its own unique sound. Circle the letters _ng_ .
Remind them that they have already learned that ‘n’ and ‘g’ are a consonant
blend; you can hear two different sounds when they are next to each other,
as in the previous high-frequency word _long_ .


- Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves: /s/ /u/ /m/ /th/ /i/ /n/ /g/. For
additional support, display the Spelling Cards for each sound.


- Direct the class to page 4, and read the first sentence aloud, beginning with
“The next day . . .” Model fluent reading, and remind students to alter their
voice and reading style to match the character’s emotion. Ask students to
finish reading the paragraph independently.


- Point out the word _contain,_ and ask: What vowel team is working in this word? _(ai)_


- What do you notice about the position of the sound within the word? _(it is in_
_the middle of a syllable.)_


- Ask: What other _ai_ or _ay_ vowel teams appear in this paragraph? _(Friday,_
_explained, and exclaimed)_


Foundational Skills 4


 - Note that the word _said_ has an _ai_ . Explain that _said_ is a rare example where the
_ai_ vowel team does not make the /ae/ sound.


 - Pair students with intentional reading partners.


 - Direct partners to read the rest of Chapter 1 through page 7.


 - Partners should take turns reading each paragraph aloud. While one partner
reads, the other should follow along and look for _ai_ and _ay_ words.


 - After students finish reading, use strategic prompts to check for
comprehension. When discussing the Reader or strategic prompts, remind
students to speak at an appropriate rate and volume while maintaining eye
contact. Example prompts include:


1. **Literal:** Why did Mrs. Chen tell Frankie and Alonso not to run at the zoo?
_(because they would frighten the animals)_


2. **Inferential:** Why did Frankie tell her mom that she and Alonso were excited to
see the meerkats? _(to explain why she was running at the zoo)_


3. **Evaluative:** What question does Frankie ask at the end of the chapter? Why do you
think she asks it? _(Why do we need so many rules? Because she is thinking about all_
_the rules she has heard lately and doesn’t understand why they are important.)_


 - Ensure students speak coherently and draw evidence from the text to support
their response. Provide sentence stems as needed such as:


   - Mrs. Chen told Frankie and Alonso not to run at the zoo because ...


   - Frankie told her mom she was excited to see the meerkats because...


   - Frankie’s question is... I think she asks this because...


 - Ask students to share what other _ai_ and ay words they found in this section of
the Reader. (stay, days, away)


 - As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual reading
ability and ability to decode multisyllabic words with the _ay_ and _ai_ pattern.


~~**PRACTICE WITH ENCODE AND APPLY (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students open to Activity Page 2.2 and follow the directions..


 - Direct students to the first word bank which contains /ae/ words.


 - Instruct students to read each word with the /ae/ sound in the first word bank
and underline the letters that make the /ae/ sound in each word. Tell students
they will next read the words in the second word bank, which contain other
words from the Reader. Students will then choose at least one word from each
word bank to write a silly sentence related to the Reader, _Frankie Figures It Out._

words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.


Foundational Skills 4


- Instruct students to turn to a partner and explain what an affix is to activate
background knowledge. Remind students that an affix is a group of letters
added to the beginning or end of a base word that changes the whole word’s
meaning. Prefixes are affixes added to the beginning of a word, and suffixes
are affixes added to the end of a word. Affixes add a syllable to the base word.


- Write the following words on the board: _unhappy_, _untie_, _uncle_ . Draw a box
around the letters _un_  - in each word.


- Point to the word _unhappy,_ and read it aloud. Explain that if you remove the
letters _un_, you are left with the base word _happy_ .


- Point to the word _untie,_ and read it aloud.


- Ask: If you remove the _un_ in this word, what remains? _(tie)_


- Explain that both _happy_ and _tie_ are words, so _un_ - is a prefix.


- Point to the word _uncle,_ and read it aloud.


- Ask: If you remove the _un_ in this word, what remains? _(cle)_


- Explain that cle is not a word, so in this case, _un_ is not acting as a prefix. It is
not adding to a base word _cle_ .


- Explain that some prefixes have more than one meaning, but they are usually
similar. For example, the prefix _un_  - can mean _not_, as in _unhappy_ . When you are
_unhappy_, you are feeling sad or may feel bad. _Unhappy_ means “not happy.”


- Explain that another meaning of the prefix _un_ - is “do the opposite of,” as in
_untie_ . If you _untie_ your shoes, you are taking the laces out of the bow they
were in to hold your shoes on your foot. The laces are no longer tied. _Untie_
means you are doing the opposite of _tie_ .


- Display Word Matrix _un–_ (Digital Component 5.2 or distribute copies of TR
5.1) and explain the contents of each column. In the first column is the prefix
_un–_ in the middle is space for a base word, finally the last column has three
different suffixes that have been taught previously. Review the meaning of
each suffix with students.

|Prefix|Base Words|Suffix|
|---|---|---|
|_un–_||_–ed_<br>_–ing_<br>_–able_|



- Tell students they will create new multisyllabic words with _un–_ prefix using
the matrix for support.


- Model first using the base word _depend,_ which means to rely on. Demonstrate
adding the prefix _un–_ and the suffix _–able_ . Write _undependable_ on the board.

- Display Word Matrix _dis–_ and _mis–_ .


- Inform students that in this lesson they will work with the prefixes _dis–_ and
_mis–_ . Prompt students to follow these steps. First turn to a partner and
share words they can think of that begin with the prefixes _dis–_ or _mis–_ . Invite
students to share their answers with the class. Next, challenge them to think
of words that also include the suffixes on the Word Matrix.


- Reiterate that prefixes change the meaning of the base word.


- Explain that _mis–_ usually means that something went wrong, did not go as
planned, or did not happen the way it should.


- Write _misread_ on the board in cursive, modeling the correct letter formation.
Instruct students to whisper the word into their cupped hand.


- Use sound-by-sound blending to decode _misread_ . Explain that _misread_ can
be pronounced /m/ /i/ /s/ /r/ /ee/ /d/ or /m/ /i/ /s/ /r/ /e/ /d/ depending
on if the word is used for the present tense or past tense.


- Point to _misread_ .


- Ask: What is the prefix? _(mis–)_


- Draw a box around the prefix _mis–_ .


- Cover up the prefix _mis–._


- Ask: What base word remains when we remove the prefix _mis–_ ? _(read)_


- Explain that adding the prefix _mis–_ to the base word _read_ creates the new
word _misread_ .


- Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share: What does it mean to _misread_
something? _(It means an error was made when reading or the person came to_
_the wrong conclusion.)_


- Provide the sentence stem: To _misread_ means to . . .


- Provide an example for students: If a recipe calls for a teaspoon of salt but
someone adds a teaspoon of sugar instead, they probably misread the recipe.


- Inform students that _dis–_ means “the opposite” or “not.” Explain that when
_dis–_ is put in front of a word, it usually changes the base word to mean the
opposite of its original meaning.


- Write _discover_ on the board in cursive, modeling the correct letter formation.
Instruct students to whisper the word into their cupped hand.


- Ask: What is the prefix? _(dis–)_


- Draw a box around the prefix _dis–._

- Cover up the prefix _dis–_ .


- Ask: What base word remains when we remove the prefix _dis–_ ? _(cover)_


- Explain that adding the prefix _dis–_ to the base word _cover_ creates the new
word _discover_ .


- Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share: What does it mean to _discover_
something? _(To discover means making something known or uncovering it.)_


- Clarify that, since _dis–_ means “not,” to _discover_ means that something is not
covered; therefore, it is able to be seen or found.


- Prompt students to turn and talk: What did Frankie discover during her
experience at the pool? _(Rules at the pool keep everyone safe while still_
_having fun.)_


- Write the word _mistake_ on the board. Instruct students to whisper the word
into their cupped hand.


- Ask: What is the base word in mistake? _(take)_


- Underline _take,_ and draw a box around _mis–_ .


- Ask: What does _mistake_ mean? _(Mistake means you do something that is not_
_quite right or you do something that is not thought of as the correct way to do it.)_


- Write the word _disrespected_ on the board. Instruct students to whisper the
word into their cupped hand.


- Ask: What is the base word in _disrespected_ ? _(respect)_


- Note: Some students might also identify _–ed_ as the suffix.


- Underline _respect_ and draw a box around _dis–._


- Ask: What does _respect_ mean? _(Respect means treating others how you_
_would like to be treated.)_


- Explain that _mistake_ and _disrespected_ are words from the chapter students
will read in their Reader today.


- Prompt students to turn and talk: What prediction can you make about the plot
of the chapter based on these words? _(I think Frankie will make a mistake that_
_makes someone feel disrespected, or she will witness someone else do this.)_

Have students brainstorm
a list of words that include
the prefix _re–_ and discuss
the meanings of these
words. Provide a sentence
stem: The word ___ means



___ means
___



.




 - Inform students that in this lesson they will work with the prefix _re–_ . Prompt
students to turn to a partner and share words they can think of that begin
with the prefix _re–_ . Invite students to share their answers with the class.


 - Challenge them to think of words that also include the suffixes on the Word
Matrix.


 - Reiterate that prefixes change the meaning of the base word.


 - Explain that _re–_ means “again.” Adding the prefix _re–_ to a base word changes
the meaning of that word to mean it is done “again.”


 - Write _reexamine_ on the board in cursive, modeling the correct letter
formation. Instruct students to whisper the word into their hand.


 - Ask: What is the prefix? _(re–)_


 - Draw a box around the prefix _re–_ .


 - Cover up the prefix _re–_ .


 - Ask: What base word remains when we remove the prefix _re–_ ? _(examine)_


 - Explain that adding the prefix _re–_ to the base word _examine_ creates the new
word _reexamine_ .


 - Prompt students to turn to a partner to discuss: What does the word
_reexamine_ mean? _(_ Reexamine _means to look at something in a close way_
_more than once.)_


 - Provide an example for students: After finding new evidence, the detective
decided to reexamine the case to uncover the truth.


~~**PRACTICE WITH PREFIX RE– (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students open to Activity Page 7.1. Invite a student volunteer to read

- Tell students that like the high-frequency word _fall_, _drawing_ is a homonym;
it is a word that has multiple meanings but is spelled and pronounced the
same. Elicit from students several different meanings for the word _draw_ or
_drawing,_ and ask them to provide sample sentences.


- Focus on the word _paper_ . Have students turn and talk with a partner about
where to divide the word based on their knowledge of syllables. Ask pairs to
write the word _paper_ with lines dividing the syllables. Confirm that the word
should be divided pa/per.


- Guide the class in reading the next section of the Reader, pages 24–31.

##### Foundational Skills


**Primary Focus:** Students will read and spell words with suffixes that change the
base word by adding _–ist_ . ~~**[TEKS 3.2.A.vi; TEKS 3.2.B.vii; TEKS 3.2.D]**~~


Students will identify the meaning of words with the _–ist_ affix.

~~**TEKS 3.1.B; TEKS 3.2.D; TEKS 3.3.C**~~


~~**INTRODUCE SUFFIX –IST (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that an affix is a group of letters that can be added to the
beginning or the end of a word to make a new word. These little parts change
what the new word means. When an affix is added to the beginning of a word,
it’s called a prefix, and when an affix is added to the end of a word, it’s called
a suffix. Have students turn to a partner and discuss the other affixes they
have learned so far in this unit and brainstorm a list of words with those
affixes. Say: Today, we will be discussing the suffix – _ist_ .


  - Write – _ist_ on the board.


  - Explain that the suffix – _ist_ means “one that works at, is connected with, or
believes in.” Write or display this definition on the board.


  - Remind students that an affix is always added to a base word. In this case,
when _–ist_ is added to a base word, it means “one that works at, is connected
with, or believes in the thing referred to in the base word.”


  - Explain that when the suffix _–ist_ is added to a word, the new word is always a
noun. Explain that sometimes the base word is already a noun, and it remains
a noun when – _ist_ is added to it.


  - Display Word Matrix _–ist_ .


  - Ask: What new word is created when you add the suffix _–ist_ to this word?
_(specialist)_


    - Tell students _special_ is a word that means different and important. So, a
_specialist_ is a person who is really good at one special thing.


    - Remind students of when Frankie went to her mom’s office and there
were specialists that worked there.


**TEKS 3.2.A.vi** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words using knowledge of suffixes, including how

   - Write the word _pharmacy_ in the base word column. Ask students to
recall the vocabulary word from the previous lesson ( _pharmacist_ ). Have
students engage in a turn and talk to review this word.


   - Activate prior knowledge and ask students to turn and talk to discuss what
they know about pharmacies using the sentence stem: A pharmacy is a
place where . . .


   - Confirm that it is a place where people can get medicine prescribed by
doctors.


 - Ask: What new word is created when you add the suffix _–ist_ to the word
_pharmacy_ ? _(pharmacist)_


 - Write _pharmacist_ on the board.


 - Ask : How did the spelling of the word _pharmacy_ change when the suffix _–ist_
was added to it? _(The ‘y’ was dropped.)_


 - Explain that if the suffix starts with a vowel, like _–ist_, you usually drop the
_ye_ at the end of the base word before adding the suffix. This is true for most
base words that end in vowels (or ‘y’ functioning as a vowel).


 - How does the suffix _–ist_ help you understand what the word _pharmacist_
means? How does it help you understand the meaning of _specialist_ ?


~~**PRACTICE WITH DICTATION (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students open to Activity Page 9.1.


 - Read aloud the following words with the suffix _–ist_ and prefixes _mis–_ and _un–_
as students write them in the lines provided:


   - finalist

   - artist


   - unexpected


   - misdirect


 - Direct students to the lines. Instruct students to write the sentence: The
library has books about job skills like being a cartoonist, and they also have
books about history.


 - Circulate and monitor as students write in cursive on Activity Page 9.1,
providing immediate and corrective feedback for proper letter formation and
on students’ ability to apply the suffix _–ist_ to base words. Give feedback such
as, “Remember to keep your letters consistently sized. Try making your ‘b’ a

**Intermediate**
Provide a list of base words
and words with various
affixes (i.e., _interpret_ /
_misinterpret_, _violin_ / _violinist_,
_eventful_ / _uneventful_ ).
In pairs, have students
choose a base word
and incorporate it into a
sentence with a word with
the corresponding affix.


**Advanced/Advanced High**

In small groups, have
students take turns
describing a word with
one of the reviewed affixes
without saying it directly.
Others listen to the clues
and guess the word. Words
can include _misinterpret_,

~~**ELPS 1.E; ELPS 2.G**~~


Challenge


Invite students to search
the previously read sections
of the Reader to find some
words with the previously
reviewed affixes. Ask them
to create a poem, song, or
collage using these words.


**96**



~~**PLAY I HAVE, WHO HAS? (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Move students into small groups. Pass out a set of I Have, Who Has? cards to
each group.


  - Explain the game:

    - Pass out the cards so that each student has the same number of cards.

    - Before beginning, instruct students to read their cards to familiarize
themselves with their words and “Who has…” questions.

    - Identify who has the first card (The card says: “I have the first card!” at
the top).

    - Explain that the first person will start the game by reading the question on
their card, beginning with “Who has . . .” Students then look at their cards
to see if the word at the top of one of their cards answers the question.

    - The person who has the correct word says, “I have . . .”, followed by the
word. If they are correct, they continue the game by reading their “Who
has…” question. If they are incorrect, students keep looking for the
correct answer.

    - Note that a student might have the card that answers the question on a
card they read and should simply continue with the game play.

    - The game ends when students read the final card.


  - If time allows, groups can reshuffle the cards and play again.

_New Word_ . Write – _al_ in the suffix column. Write the following words in the
base word column: _music_, _tide_, _globe_ .


 - Tell students they will read the base word plus the suffix – _al_ to read the
new word.


 - Model for the students by pointing to the base word _music_, the suffix – _al_,
then write as you read the word _musical_ in the last column.


 - Ask: What does the word _musical_ mean? _(It is an adjective that describes_
_something related to music.)_


 - Repeat with _tide_ and _globe_ . Ask students to turn and talk with a partner about
which two words go in the last column and what they mean. _(tidal, global)_


 - Direct students to Activity Page 11.1. Explain that students will read the

  - Ask: What did you notice about my tone and pace as I read that passage? _(It_
_was faster at the beginning and then you slowed down.)_


  - Ask: Where did my tone and pace change, and why? _(It changed when it went_
_from describing a child being loud to Frankie realizing how important it was to_
_be quiet at the zoo.)_


  - Students will read the text aloud, using intonation and expression, through
page 49.


  - Direct students to the final two paragraphs on page 49, which includes
dialogue between Frankie and her mom. Invite students to work with a
partner to practice reading the two paragraphs. First, they must decide who
will be Frankie and who will be Frankie’s mother.


  - Allow time for partners to practice reading the passage with fluency.
Encourage them to provide feedback to one another and to discuss what
tone and pace should be used in different parts of the passage.


  - As needed, use the Grade 3 Fluency Record to track students’ ability to read
with phrasing and intonation.


  - Time permitting, invite all partners to stand and perform a reading of the
passage. Provide positive feedback and praise for students, and point out
differences in the way various students interpreted the passage.


Check for Understanding


As you observe partner reading, note students who need additional support in fluency,

including accuracy, rate, and prosody. Work with students one-on-one to more accu
rately assess and address fluency gaps. If students need more fluency practice, make

use of the resources in the Fluency Supplement.

dinner. Have students turn to a partner and discuss what _plenty_ means.


**plenty, adj.,** a large amount; as much or as many as one needs
Example: There were plenty of parking spots at the county fair, so we were able
to park right up front.


  - Model how to use the Glossary in the Reader to discover the pronunciation
and definition of words in bold. Review the definition together, and ask
students to share their understanding of the word. Call on a few students to
share their thoughts.

  - Before reading, write or display the homophones that students will
encounter in today’s reading. ( _new_, page 54; _knew_, page 54; _know_, page
56; _close,_ page 57; _week_, page 57; _hear_, page 57; _allowed_, page 57)


  - Direct students’ attention to those words, and ask if they can spell the
homophone pairs for those words. ( _knew_, _new_, _no_, _clothes_, _weak_, _here_, _aloud_ )


Foundational Skills 4


  - Direct students to Think-Pair-Share: Why is it important to know which
word to use? _(Homophones have different meanings, so the wrong word_
_will confuse the reader.)_


- Display and model fluently reading the first paragraph of the section starting
at “Later that night . . .”


- Ask: What homophones did you notice in that paragraph? _(_ new _and_ knew _)_


- Direct students to turn to an elbow partner and explain the difference in
meaning between _new_ and _knew_ . _(New means “unused,” and knew is the past_
_tense of “to know.”)_


- Move students into partners. Explain that students are going to read the
remainder of Chapter 8 starting at “’I know there . . .’” through page 57. Direct
them to take turns reading each paragraph aloud to their partner and to give
a thumbs-up when they spot a homophone.


- When discussing the Reader or strategic prompts, remind students to
speak at an appropriate rate and volume while maintaining eye contact. Use
strategic prompts to check for comprehension. Example prompts include:


1. **Inferential:** What was Frankie’s main problem at the beginning of the story?
_(She didn’t understand why there are so many rules to follow.)_


2. **Literal:** Which sentence on page 53 shows that Frankie understands that
rules are important? _(They are there to keep everyone safe, and you can still_
_have fun while following the rules.)_


3. **Evaluative:** Based on the events that take place at the end of the story, what
will Frankie most likely do the next time she visits a place that has lots of
rules? _(She will think about why the rules are important.)_


4. **Evaluative:** Why do you think following the rules is important part of being a
good citizen? _(Answers may vary.)_


- Ensure students speak coherently and draw evidence from the text to
support their response. Provide sentence stems as needed such as:


  - The main problem was...


  - The text says...


  - Frankie will...


  - Rules are important because...


- As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual reading
ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record. Record notes about mispronunciations,
self-correction, pacing, transposition of words, and expression.

**Note to Teacher**


Today, the students will begin the multi-part Assessment. In the first part, you will
work one-on-one with students to complete the Fluency Assessment. Students
will engage in a review activity while awaiting their turn for the assessment.
Remind students to use a whisper voice, since testing will be taking place
concurrently with other activities.


You will most likely need more than one day to test each student; you may plan on
using time during the following lesson to complete the Fluency Assessment.


The second part of the assessment takes place in the next lesson. It is a reading and
spelling exercise targeting each of the skills taught in Unit 4.


**Reading**

  - Gather books of varying complexity for students to choose from during SelfSustained Reading time.

  - Make copies of the Self-Sustained Reading Tracker (TR 14.2) for students so
they can record their reading progress.

  - Predetermine collaborative small groups of three to five students for I Have,
Who Has?

  - Copy and cut out one set of I Have, Who Has? Cards (TR 8.1) per small group.


**Universal Access**

  - Involve learners in assessing their learning progress. This could involve
checklists, reflection journals, or self-scoring guides that help students
evaluate their understanding and skills.

  - Prepare a passage from the Reader for students to respond to in a reading
journal or reading response activities.

the unit skills. Students should use whisper voices because their peers will be
concurrently testing as they play the review game.


  - Move students into collaborative small groups. Pass out a set of I Have, Who
Has? Cards (TR 8.1) to each group.


  - Explain the game:

    - Pass out the cards so that each student has the same number of cards.

    - Identify who has the first card (The card says: “I have the first card!” at the top).

    - Explain that the first person will start the game by reading the question on
their card, beginning with “Who has…?” Students then look at their cards
to see if the word at the top of one of their cards answers the question.

    - The person who has the correct word says, “I have…” followed by the word.
If they are correct, they continue the game by reading their “Who has…?”
question. If they are incorrect, students keep looking for the correct answer.

    - Note that a student might have the card that answers the question on a
card they read and should simply continue with the game play. Remind
students to converse politely in all situations.

    - The game ends when students read the final card. Remind students to
speak politely to their groups during _I Have, Who Has?_

  - Transition students to quiet reading time. Students will be reading
independently and quietly while peers continue to take the Fluency
Assessment.


  - Use a previously established protocol for selecting recreational reading
materials.


  - Allow students to find comfortable places around the classroom to read.


  - Remind students of the expectations for quiet, independent reading and the
importance of building reading stamina.


  - Provide suggestions for how students can maintain focus while reading, such
as breaking the text into chunks and taking short breaks between chunks or
sitting in a different location.


Check for Understanding


Encourage students to keep track of the books they are reading and the pages on

which they started and ended. Ensure students write on the Self-Sustained Reading

takes the student to read the text. Allow each student three minutes to
read the story. Students with proficient fluency should be able to complete
the text in this amount of time. Instruct students to speak coherently and
complete the comprehension questions after reading the text.


 - Have one student at a time come to a quiet assessment area to read “The Fox
Rescue” with you.


 - Ask the student for Activity Page 14.1 (Fluency Assessment) and Activity
Page 14.2 (Fluency Assessment Questions).


 - Tell the student that you will ask them to read the story aloud.


 - Explain that you are going to use a watch to see how long it takes them to
read the story. Tell the student that this is not a race; they should read at
their regular pace and not rush.


 - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the title. If you are
using a watch, write the exact Start Time, in minutes and seconds, on your
record page.


 - If you are using a stopwatch, you do not need to write down the start time
since the stopwatch will calculate Elapsed Time.


 - As the student reads the story, make a running record on a copy of the text
using the following guidelines:

|Words Read Correctly|No mark is required.|
|---|---|
|**Omissions**|Draw a long dash above the word omitted.|
|**Insertions**|Write a caret (^) at the point where the insertion was<br>made.|
|**Words Read Incorrectly**|If you have time, write down the word that was<br>inserted.|
|**Substitutions**|Write an ‘X’ above the word.|
|**Self-Corrected Errors**|Write the substitution above the word.|
|**Teacher-Supplied Words**|Replace the original error mark with an ‘SC’.|
||Write a ‘T’ above the word (counts as an error).|



 - When the student finishes reading the text, write the exact Finish Time in
minutes and seconds on your record sheet.


Foundational Skills 4



**128**


  - Alternatively, if you are using a stopwatch, simply write down the Elapsed
Time in minutes and seconds.


  - If the student reads very slowly, you may need to stop the reading before the
student gets to the end of the text. (Three minutes should be enough time to
get a measurement.) If the student does not read to the end, draw a vertical
line on the record sheet to indicate how far the student read. Also, write down
either the Finish Time or the Elapsed Time.


  - Direct the student to read and select the correct answer for each question on
Activity Page 14.2. Encourage them to reference the text as they respond.


  - Repeat this process for additional students.


Activity Page 14.2: Fluency Assessment


  - If the reading was fairly accurate (<10 uncorrected errors), you can get a rough
(and easy) estimate of a student’s W.C.P.M. score simply by noting the time
and looking at the chart on the Unit 4 W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet (TR 14.1).


  - To calculate a student’s exact W.C.P.M. score, follow the steps described.


    - First, complete the Words section of the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


    - Count Words Read. This is the total number of words that the student
read or attempted to read up to the point where they stopped. It includes
words that the student read correctly as well as words that the student
read incorrectly or skipped over. If the student attempted to read the
whole text, including the title, use 314 words as your total. If the student
did not finish the text, you will need to count the number of words that
the student actually attempted to read. Write the count for Words Read in
the matching box on the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


    - Count the Uncorrected Mistakes noted in your running record. This
includes words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and words
that you had to supply. Write the total in the box labeled Uncorrected
Mistakes. A mistake that is corrected by the student is not counted as
one; the student is penalized for the time they lost making the correction,
but not for the initial mistake.


    - Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get Words Correct.


    - Next, complete the Time section of the activity page.


    - Calculate Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a
stopwatch, this should already be done for you. Skip to the next step.)
If you used a watch and recorded start and stop times, you will need to

subtract the Start Time from the Finish Time to calculate the Elapsed
Time. Subtract seconds from seconds, then minutes from minutes.
Calculate Time in seconds. Multiply the number of minutes by 60 to
convert minutes to seconds and then add the number of seconds.


  - Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then multiply by 60 to get
Words Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.).


 - As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider:


  - It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.
scores. However, a major goal for Grade 3 students is to read with
sufficient fluency to ensure comprehension and independent reading of
school assignments in subsequent grades. Exact fluency targets vary
from state to state; the national mean calculated by Hasbrouck and
Tindal in 2017 for Winter of Grade 3 is 97 W.C.P.M.


  - A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared with the scores of other
students in the classroom (or grade level) and also with the national
fluency norms for Winter of Grade 3 obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal.
Students whose scores are below the 25th percentile (79 W.C.P.M.) are
experiencing serious problems in reading fluently.


 - Compare the student’s W.C.P.M. score to national norms for Winter of
Grade 3 (Hasbrouck and Tindal, 2017):


 - After you have entered each student’s score on the Unit 4 W.C.P.M.
Calculation Sheet, record it on the Grade 3 End-of-Year Summary for each
student.

**Note to Teacher**


Today, you will complete the multipart Unit 4 Assessment. The Reading &
Spelling portion of the Assessment takes place during the first 20 minutes
of this lesson. Once students have completed the assessment, they will have
time for quiet recreational reading for 10 minutes. Use time in this lesson to
finish working with students who did not complete the Fluency Assessment
in the previous lesson.


You may also use Pausing Point day to administer the optional Tricky Word
Assessment included in Teacher Resources to specific students that you
suspect may not have thoroughly mastered the Tricky Words and highfrequency words reviewed in this unit.


**Foundational Skills**

  - Provide colored pencils for students to use when checking and correcting
their spelling on Activity Page 15.1.


  - As needed, prepare a copy of the optional Unit 4 Tricky Word Assessment and
the Unit 4 Tricky Word Assessment Analysis.


**Reading**

  - Consider preparing games used in previous lessons in this unit for review to
be available as an optional activity after assessments.


  - Gather books of varying complexity for students to choose from during SelfSustained Reading time.


  - Remind students to continue using the Self-Sustained Reading Tracker (TR
14.2) to record their reading progress.


**Universal Access**

  - Provide audiobooks or books in students’ home languages as options for
recreational reading.


  - To gain additional information about students’ mastery of unit skills, provide
targeted practice to accelerate learning where errors occurred during the
Reading Assessment. Place Activity Page 15.1 in front of the student. Have
the student read the line(s) that contained the error. Then, ask the student
to point and read the correct word for that line. The student’s oral response
will indicate whether the mistake was a careless error or whether the student
needs additional instruction in specific letter-sound correspondences. If the
student makes more than six uncorrected mistakes, they need additional
support with word recognition and may need more practice decoding

and Spelling Assessment Scoring Analysis (TR 15.2) to help determine and
understand which phonemes and words students missed.


  - Provide a tracking tool for students to record their progress on each of the
Skills summative assessments. Guide them through the process of defining
their goals, breaking them down into smaller steps, and creating a plan of
action. Incorporate regular reflection activities where students can assess
their progress, identify obstacles, and adjust their goals as needed.

own words, can you retell
what happened in the story?
How did the main character
feel at the beginning of the
story? How about at the
end? What was the problem
or challenge the characters
faced, and how did they
solve it? What lesson do
you think the author wants
readers to learn from the
story? Can you relate any of
the events or characters in
the story
to something in your own
life? How?

##### Pausing Point


This is the end of Unit 4. Analyze the results from the Unit 4 Assessments in

the two previous lessons, and determine which skills in the unit students need

to review. Pause here, and spend 1 day providing targeted acceleration in the

specific areas of weakness. This is also a good time to expand the abilities of

students who are able to go further and need a challenge. Students can do any

combination of the exercises listed below, in any order. The exercises are listed

by unit objectives. You may find that different students need extra practice

with different objectives. It can be helpful to have students focus on specific

exercises in small groups.

**Targeted Dictation for /ae/**


- You may wish to do this exercise cooperatively, offering feedback as you

complete the items, rather than presenting it in test-like format where no

feedback is given until you return the students’ written work.


- Choose one of the following sets of words.


- Ask students to take out a pencil and a piece of paper.


- Explain you are going to say ten words and all words will follow a pattern.


- Ask students to provide the pattern for the words you have chosen.


- Tell students to write each word you say.


- Explain you are going to say ten words, all will have the /ae/ sound spelled _ai_

or _ay_ . Tell students, for this exercise, they should use the _ay_ spelling if the

/ae/ sound is at the end of a syllable and the _ai_ spelling in all other cases.





**Sound Quest**

- Move students into partners. Distribute a set of Prefix Memory Cards to each

pair.


- Explain that the students will practice with words that have the prefixes _un_ 
_re_ –, _pre_ –, _dis_ –, and _mis_ –.


- Direct partners to lay out the cards face down on the table. Partners will take

turns flipping over two cards. If they are a match, the prefix word will complete

the sentence on the card. The student should remove the matching cards from

the table. If they are not, the cards should be flipped back over. Play continues

until all pairs have been made.


**Moon Shot**


- Move students into pairs. Provide each pair with a Moon Shot Game Board, Oh

No! Cards, and Good to Go! Cards. Provide each student with a set of Moon

Shot Word Cards. Provide small tokens as playing pieces.


- Explain that in this game of Moon Shot, the words they will be reading all have

_un_ –, _re_ –, _pre_ –, _dis–_, and _mis_ - prefixes.


- Review the game instructions:


   - Students take turns drawing a word card from their own pile.


   - If a student reads the word correctly, he or she can draw a Good to Go!

card and follow the directions on the card.


   - If a student does not read the word correctly, he or she will draw a card

from the Oh No! pile and follow the directions on that card.


   - The first student to make it to the moon is the winner!


- After they finish playing, have students open to Activity Page PP.3.


- Direct students to choose five words from their cards, and write them on

Activity Page PP.3, and then choose two additional words to use in sentences.


- Remind students to write words in cursive, leaving space between words.

**Four Across Suffixes**


- Prepare by making a copy of Four Across Suffixes Game Board and Base Word

Cards for each pair of students.


- Divide students into pairs.


- Player 1 selects a base word card. Player 1 adds a suffix to the base word to

create a new word and places it in the first available box in the corresponding

column on the game board. Student may write initials next to the word or use

a different colored pencil to distinguish their words from the other player.


- Player 2 repeats the process, adding their new word to the first available box in

the corresponding column on the game board.


- Players take turns adding words with suffixes to the game board until one

player gets four words in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.


- Extension: After the game, review the words created on the game board.

Discuss the meanings of the words and how the suffixes change the base

words.


~~**MORE HELP WITH HOMOPHONES**~~


**Write the Homophone**


- Ask students to turn to Activity Page PP.5.


- Have students fill in the blank with the appropriate homophone from the box.

Foundational Skills 4


 - Write the homophones in the box above on small pieces of paper (or index

cards), and put them into a single container.


 - Players take turns drawing a homophone and using both verbal descriptions

and physical gestures to help students guess the word. However, they cannot

say the word itself or any part of it.


 - Set a time limit for each round, typically one to two minutes. If the homophone

is not guessed within the time limit, the turn ends.


 - You may choose to have students use white boards and markers to write down

and spell the homophone once it is revealed orally.


~~**MORE HELP WITH TRICKY AND HIGH-FREQUENCY WORDS**~~


 - The following box contains all of the High-Frequency Words for Unit 4.

###### Grade 3 Foundational Skills Record

Teacher Instructions: Create one copy of the Foundational Skills Record per student. Use
assessments within the unit to track the student’s progress toward mastery of each standard. Use
the rating system to indicate the level of teacher support required and the space provided to take
notes.


  - Students at level 1 require focused instruction to accelerate learning in a specific area. Use the
Additional Supports and Pausing Points to target areas of growth.


  - Students at levels 2 and 3 should be showing steady growth. These students would benefit from the
Take Home Materials and side-bar support suggestions within each lesson.


  - Students at level 4 are excelling. Use the side-bar challenge suggestions to increase rigor.

###### Grade 3 Fluency Record

Choose texts from the Grade 3 Fluency Packet or the Unit Readers for students to read aloud
as you measure their pace and accuracy. Subtract the Words Missed (words that are omitted,
mispronounced, or substituted for another word) from the Total Words in Text to determine the
number of Words Read Correctly. Divide the Words Read Correctly by the Total Words in Text to
determine the students’ accuracy. Record how long it takes the students to read the passage to
determine their Words Per Minute. Consider both accuracy and pace as well as expression when
evaluating a student’s overall fluency.

**Reading Assessment Scoring and Analysis**


The more words a student can read and the farther the student can progress in the assessment, the stronger his or her
preparation for the next unit of instruction.


The number of words read correctly indicates the following:


- Students who score 6 or fewer words out of 10 words
correctly have minimal preparation for the next unit.


- Students who score 7 out of 10 words correctly have
adequate preparation for the next unit.


- Students who score 8 or more words out of 10 words
correctly have outstanding preparation for the next unit.


After scoring the assessment, you might find it helpful to
determine which phonemes students missed that caused
them to score below the benchmark for word recognition.

**Appendix A:**
##### Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program


~~**THE SIMPLE VIEW OF READING**~~


Virtually everyone who writes about reading now recognizes that reading comprehension requires
more than just decoding ability. Many reading researchers now subscribe to a view of reading that is
known as “the simple view of reading.” This view, which is associated with reading researchers Philip
Gough and William Tunmer, holds that there are two chief elements that are crucially important to
reading comprehension: decoding skills and language comprehension ability.


To achieve reading comprehension, a person needs to be able to decode the words on the page and
then make sense of those words. The first task is made possible by decoding skills and the second
by language comprehension ability. If the person cannot decode the words on the page, she will not
be able to achieve reading comprehension, no matter how much oral language she can understand.
Even if the person can decode the words on the page, that in and of itself is still no guarantee of
reading comprehension. Thus, if a person cannot understand sentences when they hear them, they
are unlikely to understand those sentences when reading.


Supporters of the simple view—and there are a growing number of them among reading
researchers—argue that a person’s reading comprehension ability can be predicted, with a high
degree of accuracy, based on two basic measures. The first is a measure of decoding skills (e.g.,
a test of single-word reading or pseudo-word reading). The second is a measure of listening
comprehension. Researchers who hold to the simple view say, “Tell me a person’s decoding ability,
as ascertained by a word-reading task, and tell me that person’s language comprehension ability,
as ascertained by a listening comprehension task, and I can make a very accurate prediction of that
person’s reading comprehension ability.” If the person is a rapid and accurate decoder and also able
to understand a wide range of oral language—for instance, classroom presentations, news items
on the radio or TV, books on tape, etc.—then it is a safe bet the person will also do well on tests of
reading comprehension.


An interesting thing about the simple view of reading is that it can be expressed as an equation:


R = D x C


In this equation, each of the letters is a variable that stands for a specific skill:


R is a measure of reading comprehension ability.


Foundational Skills 1


D is a measure of decoding skills.


C is a measure of language-comprehension ability as measured using a listening task.


Each of these skills can be quantified as a numerical value between 0 and 1, where 0 stands for no
ability whatsoever and 1 stands for perfect, not-to-be-improved-upon ability. Most people have a
skill level that falls somewhere between these two extremes.


The equation says that if you have some decoding ability (D > 0) and you also have some language
comprehension ability (C > 0), you will probably also have some reading comprehension ability (R >
0). How much reading comprehension ability you have will depend on the exact values of D and C.


What does it mean to have no decoding ability (D = 0)? It means you cannot turn printed words into
spoken words. A person who cannot decode letters on a page cannot read. The person is illiterate.


What does it mean to have no language comprehension ability (C = 0)? It means you do not know
the language, and you cannot understand any of it when you hear other people speaking or reading
aloud in that language.


It is not very common for a person to have decoding ability (D > 0) but not language comprehension
ability (C = 0). Why would you learn to read and write a language you cannot understand? It does
happen. One famous example involves the English poet John Milton, the author of _Paradise Lost_ and
other well-known poems. Milton went blind late in life. Since Braille had not yet been invented, this
meant he could not read for himself. Nevertheless, Milton found a way to keep learning from books:
he had friends and relatives read the books aloud for him. However, he was not always able to find
a scholar who had the free time and the ability needed to read to him in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and
other ancient languages. The solution? Milton taught his daughters to decode these languages so
they could read books in those languages aloud to him. Milton did not teach his daughters the actual
languages—the thousands of words and tens of thousands of meanings. That would have been a
difficult, time-consuming task. He only taught them the rules they would need to turn letters into
sounds. Thus, his daughters acquired solid decoding skills for these languages (D > 0), but they
would have scored a zero on any measure of language comprehension (C = 0). They could turn
symbols into sounds, but they had no idea what the sounds meant. Milton, on the other hand, due
to his blindness, had no functional decoding skills (D = 0). However, by virtue of his great learning,
he was able to understand Hebrew, Latin, and Greek when they were read aloud to him (C > 0).
Between Milton and his daughters, you might say, there was reading comprehension (R), but the
younger generation brought the decoding skills (D) and the elderly poet brought the language
comprehension (C).


The Milton example is an unusual one, but it is possible to give a less unusual one. A decent teacher
can teach you to decode Russian letters (or the letters used in many other writing systems) in the


Appendix A: Overview of the Skills Strand
**231**


**232**



course of a couple days of intensive work. Since you already know a lot about reading, all you would
need to learn is which sound values the unfamiliar letters stand for. Once you learned that, you
would be able to sound out most of the words in the language, but nobody would claim that you are
reading Russian. You would have some rudimentary decoding skills (D > 0), but you would be lacking
language comprehension (C = 0). You would be able to pronounce words, but you would not be able
to make sense of them. Essentially, you would be doing what Milton’s daughters did.


~~**HOW THESE IDEAS INFORM THIS PROGRAM**~~


Although this may seem very abstract and theoretical, there are two ideas here that are very
important for reading instruction and for understanding this program. The first important idea
is that reading comprehension depends crucially on both decoding skills (D) and language
comprehension ability (C); the second is that language comprehension ability takes much longer to
acquire than decoding skills.


Milton chose to teach his daughters decoding skills because he could teach those relatively quickly.
It would have taken him much, much longer to build up their language comprehension abilities.
Likewise, in the hypothetical example just given, a decent teacher could teach you to decode
Russian print in a few days of intensive instruction, but he or she would need to keep working with
you for many weeks—possibly even many years—to teach you enough Russian words and phrases to
understand a movie, make sense of a radio report, or read a short story.


You are facing a similar situation as a teacher in the early grades. You want your students to learn
to read. A crucial first step is to teach them decoding skills. Strong decoding skills can be taught
to most young children throughout Grades K–3. It takes longer to teach decoding skills to young
children who are learning to read for the first time than it does to teach the same skills to adults
who have already learned to read in another language, and it takes longer to teach decoding skills in
English-speaking countries because English spelling is rather complex; but even so, most students
can acquire basic decoding ability in the early grades. The children will continue to automatize their
decoding skills, learn new spelling patterns, and build fluency for many more years, but the basics
can be taught in Grades K–3.


That is not the case with language comprehension ability. It is going to take you and your school
system a long time to build up your students’ language comprehension ability because this is not a
job you can accomplish in the course of a single school year. Rather, language comprehension ability
is acquired over many years. Your students began to develop a rudimentary ability to understand
language even before they could speak and continued to increase their language comprehension
abilities throughout the preschool years. They will make even more gains in your classroom and the
classrooms they join after yours. With each new sentence they read or hear, and each new subject
they study in school, they will be building up background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural
literacy, thus increasing the range of materials they are equipped to understand, first orally and later


Foundational Skills 1


via reading. The more you teach them and the more you expose them to, the more they will be able
to understand. It takes a long time to build up the vocabulary and knowledge needed to make sense
of most stories in a newspaper or magazine, but this buildup is crucial for your students’ reading
abilities: no matter how good their decoding skills may be, they will not understand what they read
unless they have the language comprehension ability to make sense of the words they decode.


The program includes two strands of instruction, and these strands correspond with the elements of
reading isolated in the simple view of reading. The Skills Strand is meant to build students’ decoding
skills (D), while the Knowledge Strand is meant to build students’ language comprehension ability
(C) by exposing them to vocabulary, concepts, and ideas through frequent reading aloud. It is
important to understand that both strands are crucial for reading comprehension in later grades.
You may feel the decoding skills taught in the Skills Strand are more important to teach in the early
grades, and certainly, this is the area where you can expect to have the most immediate impact,
but it is important that you not neglect language comprehension ability. Remember, it takes many
years to build up enough vocabulary and general knowledge to understand a wide range of printed
materials. The building of background knowledge needs to begin in Kindergarten (if not before) and
continue throughout the elementary and middle school years.


If students are not building their language comprehension ability in the early grades, their reading
scores are likely to begin to fall off in Grade 4 and later. This has been called the “fourth-grade
slump,” and it occurs because material assessed on reading tests changes over time. As students
progress through the grades, test questions focus less on rudimentary decoding skills and more
on comprehension—and comprehension depends on having sufficient vocabulary, background
knowledge, and cultural literacy to understand the words you are decoding. Thus, the importance
of language comprehension ability increases with time. A weakness in this area may not show up on
tests in early grades, but it will show up in later elementary grades.


This has been well documented in research. In one very interesting study, researchers at the
University of Kansas looked at measurements of reading comprehension (R), decoding/word
recognition (D), and listening comprehension (C) for the same 570 students in the second, fourth,
and eighth grades. They found the two factors D and C accurately predicted R in each grade
but that C became more important, in the sense that it explained more of the variation among
students over time. The measure of decoding (D) was extremely important in the second-grade
results. Twenty-seven percent of the variance in reading comprehension in second grade could be
explained by decoding skills (D) alone. Only 9 percent of the variance could be explained by listening
comprehension (C) alone. By fourth grade, however, the measure of listening comprehension
had begun to account for more variance: the unique contribution of C rose to 21 percent, while
the equivalent number for D fell. By eighth grade, fully 36 percent of the variance in reading
comprehension scores could be explained with reference to the children’s listening comprehension
ability. The unique contribution of D sank even further. In other words, while reading comprehension
depended on D and C at every stage, as the simple view would predict, C explained more and more


Appendix A: Overview of the Skills Strand
**233**


**234**



of the variation among students as time went by. What this tells us is that, once the intricacies of
decoding are mastered (and in English, this takes some time), reading comprehension depends
more and more heavily on language comprehension. Language comprehension depends on
background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural literacy.


~~**TWO MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT READING AND WRITING**~~


The Skills Strand teaches the mechanics of both reading and writing. It is based on the most current
research on reading and writing, but at the same time, it has been written in opposition to some ideas
that have been very influential in elementary education in recent decades. Two of those ideas are:


 - Learning to read and write is natural.


 - Learning to read and write is easy.


Both of these ideas have great emotional appeal. Unfortunately, both of them are wrong.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT NATURAL**~~


Many scholars have argued that spoken language is natural for human beings. The cognitive
scientist Stephen Pinker, for example, has argued that human beings have a language instinct,
meaning that humans are born with an innate capacity for learning language. This may turn out to
be true. It is at least a plausible theory since historians, linguists, and anthropologists have never
found a human culture that does not use language. When something is universal, it may turn out to
be natural.


What is true of oral language is not necessarily true of written language. In fact, with written
language, we know we are dealing with something that is not natural or innate because we know
when and where writing was invented, and we know that, even today, not all languages have a
system of writing. There are still hundreds of languages in the world that are spoken but not written
or read.


Ten thousand years ago, this was the norm rather than an exception. At that time, there were
probably no human beings who knew how to read or write. According to the linguist Florian
Coulmas, the idea of writing down language was probably developed independently by three ancient
cultures: the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, and the Chinese. Each used a slightly different system, and
the mechanisms these pioneers developed for recording speech then spread from one culture to
another, evolving as they went. If these initial inventors had not come up with schemes for writing
down speech, we might all be illiterate today.


Writing is many things. It is an art that can be taught and learned. It is an invention—one of the
greatest inventions in human history. It is a technology enabling us to do things we could not do


Foundational Skills 1


without it—a technology every bit as exciting and amazing as airplane flight or electric power. But
it is not natural. The same is true of reading, which is simply the process of unpacking, or decoding,
what somebody else has written.


Reading and writing are both highly artificial. We tend to recoil at that word. We have internalized the
idea that natural is good and artificial is bad. Therefore, we think, reading must be natural. In fact, as
the reading researcher Philip Gough has written, reading is a highly unnatural act.


The first step toward good reading and writing instruction is to understand that reading and writing
are artificial—but not necessarily in a bad sense. We need to remind ourselves that the word _artificial_
derives from the word _art_ . To say reading and writing are forms of art that had to be invented and
need to be taught to children does not make reading and writing any less wonderful or important.
On the contrary, it makes these things more wonderful and precious, and it also emphasizes the
importance of your job as a teacher. There is no job more important than teaching young children
the magnificent, valuable, and highly unnatural arts of reading and writing.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT EASY**~~


The second idea noted earlier, that learning to read and write is easy, is also mistaken. Reading and
writing are complex behaviors, and they are more complex in English than in many other languages
because English has a fairly complicated spelling system. In Spanish, for example, the relationships
between letters and sounds are mostly one-to-one, meaning each sound is usually written with
one spelling, and each spelling unit is usually pronounced one way. This is not the case in English.
To read and write English with a high degree of accuracy, there is quite a lot that students need to
learn.


As a way of demonstrating the complexity involved in learning to read and write in English, suppose
we attempted to list all the discrete bits of information a person needs to know in order to be able
to read and write in English. As a starting point, we might begin with the 26 letters and argue that
these are the 26 things one really needs to learn to read and write English. However, for each letter,
one eventually needs to learn not only the letter shape but also the letter name (to be able to read
abbreviations and initials). So that is 52 bits of information.


That is a good start, but we must not stop there. In English, all letters can be written in uppercase
and lowercase forms, and the uppercase forms are not always the same as the lowercase forms.
Compare ‘B’ to ‘b,’ ‘D’ to ‘d,’ ‘H’ to ‘h,’ ‘R’ to ‘r,’ and ‘Q’ to ‘q.’ At least 16 uppercase letters have a slightly
different form than the matching lowercase letters. So we must raise our estimate of the complexity
of the English writing system to 68 bits of information.


We are not done yet. Students must also know the 44 sounds these letters stand for. That raises our
estimate of the complexity to 112.


Appendix A: Overview of the Skills Strand
**235**


**236**



If there were a simple one-to-one relationship between letters and sounds, that might be a fairly
good estimate of the complexity of the code. Unfortunately, the relationships between sounds and
letters in English are quite complicated. The 44 sounds of English can be spelled many different
ways. In our work on this program, we have identified 150 spellings that are frequent enough to be
worth teaching in the early grades. That boosts our estimate of the complexity of the code to 262.


In addition, students need to learn to track from left to right, blend sounds into words (when
reading), and segment words into sounds (when writing and spelling). They need to learn a handful
of symbols used in writing, including the period, comma, exclamation point, question mark,
quotation mark, and apostrophe. That raises our estimate of code complexity to about 270 bits of
information.


We could boost the estimate even higher by adding Tricky Words and unusual spellings or by
pointing out that many letters in English can be pronounced in different ways. We could also point
out that reading a word like _thin_ requires students to group the first two letters and attach them to
one sound, and reading a word like _cake_ requires students to scan ahead, see the ‘e,’ and realize it
controls the pronunciation of the ‘a’ earlier.


Even without these additions, it is clear that the English writing system is quite complicated.


~~**THE PROBLEM WITH WHOLE LANGUAGE**~~


On a conservative estimate, there are 270 bits of knowledge a person needs to be able to read and
write English. It is unwise to ask students to tackle all this complexity at once and hope they will
figure it out. Yet that is precisely what is done in so-called “Whole Language” approaches. Whole
Language instruction is based on the assumption that learning to read is natural and not difficult,
so reading skills can be allowed to develop gradually, without much explicit instruction. Lots of
students in Whole Language classrooms do manage to figure out the English writing system, but
many others do not. Whole Language ideas have tremendous emotional appeal, but the Whole
Language approach is actually a recipe for _leaving many children behind_ . It is an especially risky
strategy for disadvantaged children.


A much better strategy is to introduce the English spelling code explicitly, beginning with the
easiest, least ambiguous, and most frequently used parts of the code and then adding complexity
gradually. That is the central strategy on which this program is based.


The strategy adopted in this program is the same strategy that successful coaches use when
teaching children a sport such as tennis. The successful coach does not ask students to learn
“Whole Tennis” and soak up the necessary skills all at once by trying to hit all different kinds of
shots the first day on the court. Instead, the successful coach teaches the student to hit a forehand
ground stroke and provides lots of practice hitting forehands. Then the coach moves on to teach


Foundational Skills 1


a backhand ground stroke, then a forehand volley, then a backhand volley, then a serve, then an
overhead smash, then a drop shot, etc. With each element taught, the student becomes a stronger
and more complete player. In the same way, this program begins by teaching the most common and
least ambiguous spellings for sounds and then moves on to introduce the more complex parts of the
writing system.


~~**KEY ASPECTS OF THE SKILLS STRAND**~~


Some key aspects of the Skills Strand are listed below.


  - This program teaches reading and writing in tandem, since they are inverse processes. English
writing involves making pictures of sounds; reading involves translating those pictures back into
sounds and blending the sounds to make words.


  - This program includes explicit, systematic phonic instruction in which students are taught target
skills needed to independently decode and encode words.


  - This program explicitly teaches letter-sound correspondences as opposed to leaving students to
figure these out on their own or deduce them by analyzing familiar whole words (as in some forms of
“analytic” phonics).


  - This program focuses on sounds, or phonemes, as the primary organizing principle of the program,
rather than letters.


  - This program focuses consistently on the phoneme, or single sound, and not on larger units.
Students learn to read words that contain onsets, rimes, and consonant clusters, but they learn to
view and process these larger units as combinations of smaller phoneme-level units. Rimes like _-ick_
and initial clusters like _st-_ are not taught as units but as combinations.


  - This program uses a synthetic phonics approach that teaches students to read by blending through
the whole word; it does not teach multiple cueing strategies, use of pictures as a primary resource in
decoding, or part-word guessing.


  - This program begins by teaching the most common or least ambiguous spelling for a sound (the
basic code spelling); later it teaches spelling alternatives for sounds that can be spelled several
different ways. Thus, the system is kept simple at first, and complexity is added bit by bit as students
gain confidence and automatize their reading and writing skills.


  - This program includes words, phrases, and stories for students to read and activity pages for them to
complete that allow for focused, distributed practice working with the letter-sound correspondences
they have been taught.


  - This program does not require students to read words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have learned. In other words, all words students are asked to read as
part of the program are decodable, either because they are composed entirely of letter-sound


Appendix A: Overview of the Skills Strand
**237**


**238**



correspondences students have been taught or because they are Tricky Words that have been
taught. This means students have a chance to begin reading words and stories that are completely
decodable before tackling words and stories that are full of spelling alternatives.


 - This program does not require students to write words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have been taught. In other words, students are only asked to write words that
can be spelled (at least plausibly if not always correctly) using the code knowledge they have been
taught.


 - This program carefully controls the introduction of Tricky Words and words with ambiguous or rare
spellings, preferring to have students learn to read and write with regular words that can be blended
and spelled by the letter-sound correspondences taught.


 - High-frequency words compiled from a research-based list for Grade 3 are also taught as they appear
in the unit Readers. They are revisited frequently to build automaticity and fluency.


 - This program avoids letter names because what is important for reading is not the letter name but
the sound value the letter stands for. To read the word _cat_, it is essential to know /k/ /a/ /t/, not “see
aay tee.”


~~**THE BASIC AND ADVANCED CODE**~~


The program teaches the highly complex letter-sound correspondences of the English language
in an explicit and systematic manner in Kindergarten–Grade 3. Students are taught how the 26
letters (or graphemes) of the alphabet are used in various combinations to represent 44 sounds (or
phonemes). There are approximately 150 different spellings for these sounds.


Students are first taught the basic code for each of the 44 phonemes. The basic code spelling for
a sound is usually the most common, or the least ambiguous, spelling for a sound. By learning
these letter-sound correspondences first, students experience a high degree of predictability, and
therefore success, in decoding words with these spellings.


Basic code spellings may be single letters, such as these spellings and sounds: ‘a’ > /a/, ‘e’ > /e/, ‘b’

- /b/, and ‘m’ > /m/. Basic code spellings may also include digraphs, or two letters to represent a
sound, such as _ee_ - /ee/, _oy_ - /oi/, _ou_ - /ow/, _sh_ - /sh/, and _th_ - /th/. Other basic code spellings
include separated digraphs, such as ‘a_e’ > /ae/, and ‘o_e’ > /oe/.


The advanced code consists of all other spelling alternatives (over 100) that may be used to spell
the 44 phonemes in English. Examples of alternative spellings include _mm_ - /m/, _ss_ - /s/, _c_ /s/, _g_ - /j/, _ay_ - /ae/, and _ey_ - /ee/. Some of these spelling alternatives occur relatively frequently
in the English language, while others are quite rare. See the provided charts for the basic and
advanced code.

Foundational Skills 1


~~**TRICKY WORDS**~~


The term _Tricky Word_ is used in this program to refer to a word that does not “play by the rules” of
spelling and/or pronunciation. Examples of Tricky Words include _one_, _said_, _of_, _were_, and _have_ .


You can describe the trickiness of a Tricky Word like _said_ in two ways. If you think about it from a
spelling point of view, you might say that the word _said_ is tricky because the sound /e/ is not spelled
with an ‘e,’ as you might expect it would be. On the other hand, if you think about it from a reading
point of view, you might say the word is tricky because the letters _ai_ are not pronounced /ae/, as
you might expect they would be. Either way you look at it, _said_ is a Tricky Word.


But notice that the word is not completely irregular, either. The first letter and the last letter are
pronounced exactly as you would expect. It is only the second and third letters, representing the
vowel sound, that are not sounded as you would expect. Or, if you prefer to look at things from the
speller’s perspective, you might say the first and last sound are spelled just as you would expect; it
is only the middle sound—the vowel sound—that is spelled irregularly. This is the case with many
Tricky Words: most of them have a regular part (or parts) and then a tricky part. More often than
not, you will find that the tricky part involves the vowel sound and its spelling.


When you are asked to teach a Tricky Word, the guidelines in the Teacher Guide will generally prompt
you to begin by reminding students that not all words play by the rules and words that do not play
by the rules are called Tricky Words. Next, the Teacher Guide will generally suggest that you write
the Tricky Word on the board. You may wish to ask a student to read the word as he or she thinks it
might be sounded (i.e., to blend according to the normal procedures). Alternatively, you can read the
Tricky Word that way yourself. Then you can point out how the word is actually pronounced. Once
you have established the actual pronunciation, you can point out and/or discuss what is regular and
what is irregular about the word. Most Tricky Words have at least some parts pronounced exactly the
way you would expect. For example, as noted above, the first and last letter in _said_ are pronounced
just as one would expect. After discussing the regular parts, you should then draw attention to the
tricky part (or parts) of the word, pointing out letters not pronounced as one might expect they
would be (e.g., the _ai_ in _said_ ). This is the part of the word that students just have to remember.


By drawing attention to the regular as well as the irregular parts of the word, you teach students
that Tricky Words are only partial exceptions to the normal rules of reading and writing. (They are
not so much irregular as they are a little less regular than most words.) There are some parts of the
word spelled just as you would expect and also pronounced just as you would expect. Then there are
some others that are not. There is a subtle but important difference between teaching Tricky Words
this way and teaching them as single entities that have to be memorized as wholes, as if every part
of the word were unpredictable.


Appendix A: Overview of the Skills Strand
**241**


**242**



Note that some Tricky Words are actually part of spelling patterns. For example, the words _he_, _she_,
_we_, _be_, and _me_ are taught as Tricky Words in earlier grades because it is hard to write stories without
them. However, once the ‘e’ spelling alternative for /ee/ is taught, these Tricky Words can be seen
as part of a larger pattern that includes words like _replay_ and _prefix_ . Other Tricky Words, such as
_one_ and _of_, remain tricky even when most of the spelling alternatives have been taught. By Grade 3,
students have been taught the majority of the code knowledge needed to decode most words in the
English language. As such, there is less of an emphasis on Tricky Words in the Grade 3 program.


~~**SIGHT WORDS AND TRICKY WORDS**~~


One of the most common terms in the world of reading instruction is _sight word_ . Unfortunately, this
is also a rather ambiguous and potentially confusing term. Educators use the term _sight word_ in
two different senses. For some people, sight words are high-frequency words that students need to
encounter frequently and learn to decode rapidly and effortlessly. Other people use the term _sight_
_word_ in a more restrictive sense, to refer to words that cannot be sounded out using letter-sound
correspondences and may need to be taught as exceptions.


In this program, we define these terms as follows:


 - A Tricky Word is a word that does not play by the rules. It is a word containing at least one part that
cannot be read correctly via blending or cannot be spelled correctly using the code knowledge taught
so far.


 - A sight word is a high-frequency word that we want students to see many, many times and learn to
read quickly and eventually learn to recognize rapidly.


The main difference here is that a Tricky Word always contains some irregular element, whereas a
sight word might or might not.


There is considerable overlap between the two categories (which is probably why the two senses of
_sight word_ are regularly confused). Some words qualify as sight words because they are used a lot
and also as Tricky Words because they are not pronounced (or written) as you would expect. These
are words that are both irregular (and therefore hard to read and write, at least at first) and also very
common (and therefore important for student success). They are candidates for special instruction,
and many of them are given special instruction in this program.


Tricky Words do not qualify as sight words on most lists because they are not especially common.
Words of this sort are sprinkled throughout the language but do not receive much attention because
they are only used occasionally. Students can learn them as the need arises in upper grades.


Foundational Skills 1


~~**CUSTOMIZING AND ADAPTING THE PROGRAM**~~


This is a highly structured and sequenced program. We are unapologetic about that, as we believe
the structure and sequence will be very helpful to students as they work to learn the English spelling
code. However, this is not a scripted program in which teachers are required to read the manual and
give one of a handful of approved responses. We expect—indeed, we hope—teachers will tweak the
phrasing and come up with ways to customize, personalize, and adapt the instruction.


Our goal has been to put things in a logical order and provide all the guidance and support
necessary for a new teacher, or a teacher new to this kind of phonics instruction.


At the same time, we believe there is room for experienced and creative teachers to customize
and adapt the program. Indeed, some of the exercises included in this version of the program were
developed by teachers in our pilot programs!


Sometimes in the lessons, we give exact phrasing that we suggest you use; more often, however, we
give indirect phrasing and/or encourage you to explain something using your own words. You should
feel free to make changes to the phrasing. For example, you may prefer to speak of “a picture of a
sound” or a “spelling.” Later in the year, you may want to teach the term _digraph_, or you may prefer
to refer to the letters in a digraph as a “letter team” or as “buddy letters.” There are many ways to
customize the program and the language while preserving the basic instructional principles and
sequence of instruction.


For the presentation of words, you may write on a chalkboard, a whiteboard, chart paper, an
overhead projector, a document camera, or the projection system of your choice. A projection
system works especially well for activity pages since it allows the teacher to model the task exactly
as the students will be completing it. You may use a pocket chart, a magnetic board with magnetic
letters, an overhead projector with letters cut from a transparency, or a smart board. Many
modifications of this sort can be made without adversely impacting the quality of the instruction.


You should also always feel free to add additional activities and activity pages that are consistent
with our philosophy of instruction. You should always feel free to respond to the teachable moment,
even if it leads you slightly off the path laid out in the Teacher Guide.


There are only a handful of things you should not do:


You should not skip a lesson in which new code knowledge is taught. If you do, students will lack
important code knowledge, untaught spellings will begin to appear in their word lists and on their
activity pages, and the lessons will start to make less sense to them.


For the same reasons, you should not reorder the lessons. The program relies heavily on sequencing,
and instruction will be confused and less effective if the lessons are reordered.

~~**SMALL-GROUP WORK**~~


Large parts of this program have been written for whole-group instruction, but the program can be
customized to allow for small-group instruction of various kinds. You will note that there are Support
and Challenge sidebars sprinkled throughout the lessons that will guide you in how to differentiate
instruction for your students, while still using the whole-class approach described in the lessons.


Since some students will learn the new information right away while others will need more practice,
you may wish to do small-group work to follow up the initial introduction of code knowledge. You will
note that many lessons do include suggestions for small groups; you should feel free to adapt these
and other lessons as best meets the needs of your students. We have seen this program taught very
effectively in small groups and in workstations students visit on rotation.


~~**ADJUSTING THE SPEED OF INSTRUCTION**~~


This sequence will work for most children. However, all children are different, and all classrooms are
different. Some classrooms may need more time to master concepts than others. The program has
been designed so the pace of instruction can be adjusted as needed.


The most important thing for you to know is that you can pause at any point in the program.
If students are not learning the material, simply stop where you are and do additional work to
remediate or reteach as needed. All lessons contain some materials you can use if you pause.


In addition, at the end of each unit there is a “Pausing Point.” If the end-of-unit assessment or your
observations suggest some members of the class need additional time to master the concepts
taught in the unit, this is an especially good place to stop and provide additional practice and
review. The Teacher Guides include additional work at each Pausing Point. They will typically provide
enough for at least 1–2 days of additional work. The materials provided in the Pausing Point can be
used in various ways. Sometimes you may wish to have all students do the same activity or activity
page. At other times you may wish to work individually or in small groups with students who are
struggling with a particular concept.


To slow down instruction, you can pause either in the middle of a unit or at a Pausing Point. We do
not recommend that you attempt to speed up the sequence of instruction. The program lays out an
ambitious program of instruction.


The Grade 3 program of instruction should work well for a wide range of students. You should begin
with the assumption that the Grade 3 program is an appropriate option for all students in the class.


Inevitably, however, there will be differences in learning. Students learn at different rates. Some
students will pick up the material quickly; others will have more difficulty. There are many strategies


Foundational Skills 1


for dealing with this. In general, we encourage you to try to keep most of the class together if it
makes sense. It is much easier to teach one set of students at roughly the same level than it is to
teach two or three groups at very different levels.


If you find some students are lagging, you may still be able to keep the class together for the main
lessons but find extra time two to four times a week to work with those students who seem to need
extra practice.


If this is not sufficient, you may eventually need to regroup some students. As we note in Lessons
4–5 of this unit, it is especially important to administer the placement assessment to all students at
the start of the year. We strongly recommend that teachers then use an “across grade” approach to
grouping students. If there are two classrooms, these two teachers should look at all of the Grade 3
students in both classrooms and consider regrouping students for Skills instruction only, with one
teacher taking the class of students who need review and more practice, while the other teacher
works with those students ready to move on to Grade 3 Skills instruction. It will likely be worthwhile
to reconvene at multiple times during the year to plan across the grade level, using the end-of-unit
assessments. In this way, students in need of remediation can be moved to the appropriate group,
while students who are making progress can advance.

##### Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words

Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught will enable students to read one syllable
word with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences is no guarantee
that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllabic words. To this end, most
students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk and read parts of
words—syllables—to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can then
be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated, and students are expected
to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, the program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the easiest
two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is already a
familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In addition, each
syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing, hunt·er, bust·ed_ ). The
dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain double-letter
spellings for consonants, in this program, the divider is typically placed after the double-letter
spelling rather than between the two consonants (e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers that are
familiar with other ways to chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is done, however,
because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single-spelling units since kindergarten ( _nn_

 - /n/, _mm_  - /m/, _tt_  - /t/, etc.). The program strives to be consistent in representing these spellings
in the way that the students have been taught to process them (e.g., as whole entities for a sound).
(Ultimately, as students become more proficient at decoding and chunking syllables through
subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually chunk and decode these
words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding these two-syllable words
consisting of root words and suffixes relatively easy.


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable words.

**255**

To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


**• Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound (e.g.,**
/ **a** / **,** / **e** / **,** / **i** / **,** / **o** / **,** / **u** / **):** _let_, _pad_, _rod_, _tin_, _fun_, _pic·nic_, _un·til_


**• Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g.,** / **ae** / **,** / **ee** / **,** /
**ie** / **,** / **oe** / **,** / **ue** / **):** _cake_, _home_, _like_, _mule_, _Pete_, _mis·take_, _stam·pede_


**• Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint_, _speak_, _proud_, _play_, _dis·may_, _be·low_, _coun·sel_


**• R-Controlled Syllables:** _art_, _curb_, _girl_, _fort_, _clerk_, _tur·nip_, _ar·tist_, _fe·ver_


**• Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g.,** / **ae** / **,** / **ee** / **,** / **ie** / **,**
/ **oe** / **,** / **ue** / **):** _go_, _me_, _hi_, _a·pron_, _f·nal_, _com·pre·hend_


**• Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple_, _puz·zle_, _raf·fe_, _ca·ble_, _ri·fe_


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


**• Schwa Syllables:** _ben·e·fit_, _ap·pe·tite_, _a·bout_, _hos·pit·al_, _e·mo·tion_


Note: The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately because
of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


To decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these names. The names of the
syllable types are provided here only to establish a common vocabulary for teachers as they use
the materials. What is necessary, however, for students to become fluent readers of longer words in
increasingly complex text is that they be able to visually parse certain spelling patterns as syllable
chunks so they can quickly and easily decode each syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.


Foundational Skills 1


_ad·mit_ _nap·kin_ t _rum·pet_


For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed after
the double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is because the
double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units since kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’

- /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).


_traff·ic_ _muff·in_ _happ·en_


When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.


_mon·ster_ _con·tract_ _pil·grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read
the first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model
for students how to blend the two syllables aloud:







In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the magic
‘E’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for closed
syllables:


_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


In Grades 2 and 3, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to use


Appendix B: Scope and Sequence
**257**


a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying each
possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:


_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_









**258**



However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There is
no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be flexible
and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to determine
whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. To recognize whether a
word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has heard before
(i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent an additional
challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a second language.


If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:


Foundational Skills 1


_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is straightforward.


When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings
in the words.


_ban · gle_ _twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_









Appendix B: Scope and Sequence
**259**


**260**



In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings represent
the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a combination of
stressed and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed or weakly
stressed, its vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that linguists
call a schwa. This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include ‘a’, ‘e’, _al_, _il_,
_el_ and _tion_ . Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite challenging for
many students.


Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the
schwa sound has a particular spelling:


_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is a schwa syllable, but it is identified separately
because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables
accordingly throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness_ _help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten—Grade
3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.
