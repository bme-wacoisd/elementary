Dear Families,


Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Reading Language Arts (RLA) provides TEKS-aligned language arts

instructional materials designed to support Texas learners.


Every child deserves access to knowledge! Knowledge sparks curiosity and wonder and enables all

children to discover the world. Bluebonnet Learning K–5 RLA builds knowledge and vocabulary by

integrating the teaching of foundational skills and background knowledge. Research shows that

building these skills at an early age is critical for success in later grades.


Our approach to building background knowledge is based on three pillars: content-specific

materials support the development of knowledge in history, science, literature, culture, and the

arts; cumulative topics and vocabulary connect within and across grades, allowing students to

extend knowledge and revisit topics in more depth in later grades; and coherent, intentional design

ensures the curriculum fits together as a whole.


We offer resources that focus on English foundational reading for early elementary students. The

K–3 Foundational Skills program is research-based to get real results. Learning how to read with

Bluebonnet Learning K–5 RLA is explicit, with all 44 sounds and their 150 spellings in the English

language taught, practiced, and mastered, with ample opportunity to encounter each sound/spelling

in diverse settings. Moving in a sequence from easier to more complex in phonics and foundational

reading skills, students master skills concepts before moving forward, enabling them to become

more independent readers. Decodable chapter books featuring dynamic plots and characters

provide engaging daily opportunities for kids to want to read more and practice their reading skills.


_We are thrilled to provide this K–5 literacy program, making good on our promise to Texas_
_students by providing a high-quality academic experience for educators, families, and children._


_Sincerely,_


_The K–5 RLA Team_
