# **Welcome!**
## **Grade 3, Unit 5** **Foundational Skills**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will practice reading and spelling words with various spellings of the /er/ sound, work with

suffixes, and segment multisyllable words for reading and spelling.


**What** **will** **my** **student** **learn?**


Students will learn how to read and spell words with the /er/ sound spelled _er_, _ir_, _ur_, and, less commonly, _or_ and _ar_ .

Students will be introduced to words with tricky spellings, which means that the letters can stand for more than one

sound. Students will learn about suffixes, such as _–ous_, _–ly_, _–ive_, _–y_, and _–en_ . Students will also practice reading with the

Reader, _Adventures_ _of_ _Marcus_ _and_ _Cory._ This story is about Marcus and Cory, good friends who have some adventures

that help them learn about the science of light and sound.
