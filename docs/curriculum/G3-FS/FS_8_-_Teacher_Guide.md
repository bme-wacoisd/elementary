**Grade 3 | Foundational Skills 8**
#### Introduction


~~**UNIT 8 OVERVIEW**~~


This unit introduces several new skills that students will revisit or build upon in later units. It
begins with introducing homophones, moves to vowel teams, then covers abbreviations, and ends
with affixes. Developing these foundational skills is essential to students’ proficient reading of
multisyllabic words and reading comprehension.


Building upon the work in Units 4 and 7, students will continue learning about homophones. In this
unit, students identify, use, and explain the meaning of newly introduced homophones and practice
their spellings. Learning and understanding the meanings of homophones is an important part of
vocabulary and spelling development, which will continue in Unit 9.


Students will work on decoding and encoding multisyllabic words with several vowel teams, some of
which are revisited in this unit ( _ai_ / _ay_ ), while others are introduced ( _oo_, _ew_, _ue_, _ui_ ). In these lessons,
students will apply knowledge of long and short vowel sounds to new multisyllabic words.


Several lessons in this unit focus on understanding common abbreviations that students will
encounter in text. Students will learn how to read abbreviations such as ‘Dr.,’ ‘Mrs.,’ ‘St.,’ and more.
As they complete oral and written exercises in this unit, students will have opportunities to apply
their new knowledge of how to read and spell commonly used abbreviations.


Finally, students will work with the prefixes _anti–_, _in–_, and _pro–_ . As they have learned in previous
units, students will examine how these prefixes change the meaning of base words. They will also
revisit prior learning about how affixes affect base words.


~~**TRICKY SPELLINGS**~~


As new spellings are introduced, some complexity is added to the reading process. Some of the
spelling units that students have to process are ambiguous in the sense that they can stand for
more than one sound. These ambiguous spellings are called “tricky spellings.” In Unit 8, instruction
focuses on vowel teams. Students build on this concept by examining how a vowel suffix, especially
when attached to a base word that ends in a vowel, changes the spelling of the base word.


~~**TRICKY WORDS & HIGH-FREQUENCY WORDS**~~


Tricky Words are introduced in this unit on an as-needed basis in the context of the different
selections included in the Reader. Tricky Words should be taught in the lessons before the reading
selections are assigned. When introducing Tricky Words, be sure to draw attention to the parts that
are read (and spelled) just as students would expect based on what they have learned so far and
point out the tricky parts of each word.


The Tricky Words taught in this unit are:


Introduction
**1**


Lesson 1 – _Australia_


Lesson 4 – _structure_


Lesson 6 – _algae_


Lesson 8 – _culture_


Lesson 9 – _sanctuary, marsupial_


Lesson 13 — _Melbourne_, _penguin_


In addition to addressing Tricky Words and tricky spellings, this program emphasizes the reading
and spelling of high-frequency words that have been carefully selected from word lists compiled by
researchers Edward William Dolch and Edward Fry. The selection of these words was based on their
prevalence within the Reader, and instruction is integrated into lessons at points where students will
naturally encounter these words within the assigned sections of the Reader.


The high-frequency words taught in this unit are:


Lesson 1 – _side, without, family_


Lesson 2 – _country_


Lesson 3 – _city_


Lesson 4 – _try, sea_


Lesson 6 – _took_


Lesson 8 – _kind_


~~**READER: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD**~~


Tisha, an eight-year-old girl, struggles to adapt after her family moves from Houston, Texas, to
Brisbane, Australia, due to her mother’s job promotion. Feeling disconnected from her new school
and missing her old life, Tisha finds it hard to adjust. Her father encourages her to explore and learn
about Australia, and they research the country’s unique landscapes, including the Outback, the Great
Dividing Range, and famous landmarks like the Sydney Opera House. Gradually, Tisha begins to find
interest in her new home, especially after attending the Brisbane Festival and a cricket game. Her
excitement grows when she and her father visit the Great Barrier Reef, snorkel among the sea life, and
explore islands like Lizard Island. They also learn about Australia’s First Nations people, their culture,
and their art. Tisha’s interest in Australia deepens further when the family travels to Perth, where


Foundational Skills 8
**2**


they explore Yanchep National Park and the WA Maritime Museum. Tisha finally feels more at home
in Australia when she makes a new friend, Sarah, through her love of soccer. She joins an after-school
soccer program and learns about the popularity of women’s soccer in Australia. The family continues
to plan more explorations in Australia as their attachment to their new home grows.


**Note:** Each time students encounter a new section of text in the Reader, the lesson includes new
vocabulary words and/or phrases to accompany the section of text. There are lessons in which
students reread sections of the Reader, for the purpose of building fluency. These lessons do not
introduce new vocabulary or have a vocabulary chart.


~~**UNIT 8 ASSESSMENT**~~


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


Throughout this unit, formative assessments are clearly marked for monitoring individual student
performance and progress in key skills. Quick Checks for Understanding to evaluate classroom
performance are also designated in each lesson. Fluency practice takes place regularly throughout
the unit. Records for recording student performance in an Anecdotal Reading Record, Grade 3
Foundational Skills Record, Grade 3 Fluency Record, and Grade 3 End-of-Year Summary are included
in the Teacher Resources.


**Student Performance Assessment**


In Lessons 14 and 15, you will be prompted to administer a multipart end-of-unit assessment. In the
first part, you will work one-on-one with students to complete the Fluency Assessment. Students
will engage in a review activity while awaiting their turn for the assessment. The Reading and
Spelling portion of the assessment takes place during the first twenty minutes of the second lesson.
Once students have completed the assessment, they will have time for Self-Sustained Reading.
Use time in this lesson to finish working with students who still need to complete the Fluency
Assessment in the previous lesson.


The target words in each of these assessments include the vowel sound/spellings taught in this
unit; distractors have been intentionally selected because they represent frequent sound/spelling
confusions. Student performance on these assessments is a good indicator of whether students
have mastered the new sound/spellings.


~~**CURSIVE WRITING**~~


At Grade 3, students are expected to write neatly in cursive, using correct letter formation and
leaving space between words. Throughout the program, teachers are prompted to remind students
of this expectation and provide corrective feedback.


Note that the lessons and activity pages do not comprise an exhaustive handwriting program, and
teachers may wish to consult other sources for information on topics such as writing posture, pencil
grip, and differentiated instruction for left-handed students.

~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice Unit 8 skills can be found in the
Pausing Point section included after the last lesson. It is strongly recommended that you pause for
two days and provide targeted acceleration for individual or groups of students in any areas in which
they require supplementation based on the Student Performance Assessment.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


This component has been designed to complement the unit. It consists of poetry, folklore, and
fables. These additional text selections provide opportunities for students to practice reading with
fluency and prosody (expression), indicated by the anecdotal records, as well as a way to track
progress from unit to unit. See the Unit 1 Introduction or directions in the Fluency Supplement for
further guidance.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~

Support


Remind students that
words in a dictionary are in

alphabetical order. Model

how to use the alphabet

and guidewords to find

the correct page of the

dictionary. Explain to
students that the guide
word on the left side of the

dictionary tells the first
word on the left side of the

page. The guide word on
the right side of the page

tells the last word on the

right page.


Activity Page 1.1


Challenge


Invite students to act out
the meaning of each pair of

words with their neighbor

(e.g., stare into his or
her partner’s eyes, then
pretend to walk up a flight

of stairs; pretend to break
a stick, then drive a car and

use their foot to press the

brake pedal).



~~**IDENTIFY AND EXPLAIN HOMOPHONE MEANINGS (12 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that this lesson will focus on homophones. Ask students to turn
to a partner and discuss what they already know about homophones and any
examples they know.


 - Pass out two sticky notes to each student. Write the words _week_ and _weak_ in
cursive on the board, and ask students to use their sticky notes to write what
they notice/know about these two words and draw a picture to represent
what they think they mean.


 - Collaborate and discuss what the definition of these words _week_ and _weak_
are, as a class.


 - Define what homophones are: Two or more words having the same
pronunciation, but different meanings or spellings.


 - Next, provide table groups or partners with one set of homophones _(piece/_
_peace, pear/pair, flour/flower, bye/buy, break/brake, stair/stare, break/brake,_
_dye/die, beat,beet)_ . Provide a piece of paper to have students fold in half.


 - Group students and assign tasks within the group (i.e. one person uses the

dictionary . . . all decide on a sentence . . . one person writes the sentence .
. . one person draws the illustration . . . one person presents, etc.). Set clear
expectations for collaborative group work.


 - Then, have students create an illustration of each word (one word on each

side of the paper) and write a sentence using the word in context under the
illustration. Have them consult a dictionary with a partner to check their
understanding. Each group can share their illustrations and sentences. Have
the rest of class provide feedback to confirm students have the correct
understanding. These “posters” can be hung in the classroom for students to
reference.


~~**WRITE AND SPELL HOMOPHONES (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Direct students to open to Activity Page 1.1.


 - Have students fill in each blank with the correct homophone to complete the
sentence. Remind them to write each word neatly in cursive. Write neatly in
cursive.


 - Remind students to refer to the board or look at the illustration they made as

slow down or to stop something.

Example: As I hurriedly walked through the grocery store, my mom told me
to pump the breaks and give her time to catch up.


 - Conduct a brief discussion about the different words and phrases in the
chart, including the phrase “pump the brakes.” For example, show the words
and ask students what prior knowledge they may have about these words
and where they might have seen them.


 - Model how to use the Glossary in the Reader to discover the pronunciation

and definition of words in bold. Review the definition together and ask
students to share their understanding of the word. Call on a few students to
share their thoughts.

                  - Explain that _The Other Side of the World_ contains many high-frequency

words. These are common words, so they will come across them often
as they read, in both the Reader and in many different texts. Explain that
learning to recognize these words and how to spell them will improve their
overall reading and writing fluency.


Foundational Skills 8

  - Display this lesson’s high-frequency words: _side, without,_ and _family_ .


  - Focus on the word _side_ . Ask students what they notice about the word _side_ .
Discuss that _side_ has a split digraph _i_e_ in the word to make the i a long vowel
sound /ie/.


  - Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves: /s/ /ie/ /d/. Point out that the word
_side_ in the title of this Reader, _The Other Side of the World_ .


  - Focus on the word _without_ . Ask students what they notice about the word
_without_ . Point out that _without_ is a compound word. Ask what two separate
words make without? _(with, out)_


  - Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves: /w/ /i/ /th/ /ou/ /t/


  - Focus on the word _family_ . Ask students what they notice about the word
_family_ .


  - Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves: /f/ /a/ /m/ /i/ /l/ /ee/. Clarify the
meaning of family as needed. Invite students to turn to a partner and use the
word in a sentence.


  - Guide the class in reading the first section of _The Other Side of the World_,
pages 1–5.

  - Pair students with intentional reading partners by using past assessments
and observations.


  - Direct them to partner read this section, alternating paragraphs.


  - As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual reading
ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record and provide immediate
and corrective feedback such as, “The expression you used while
reading made the story engaging and easy to follow. Record notes about
mispronunciations, self-correction, pacing, transposition of words, and
expression.


  - Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension. Have students listen
actively and ask questions to clarify any information from the Reader or
strategic prompts. Have them use context for support as needed. Example
prompts include:


1. **Literal.** Based on what you have read so far, what is Tisha’s main problem? _(She_
_and her family had to move to Australia, but she did not want to.)_ After posing

Foundational Literacy Skills


**Beginning**
Point out the vowel teams
in words. Frequently remind
students the spelling rules:
1) the /ae/ sound is usually
spelled _ai_ when it shows
up at the beginning or in
the middle of a word or
syllable; 2) the /ae/ sound
is usually spelled _ay_ when
it shows up at the end of a
word or syllable.


**Intermediate**
Occasionally point out
vowel teams in words.
Frequently remind
students the spelling
rules: 1) the /ae/ sound is
usually spelled _ai_ when it
shows up at the beginning
or in the middle of a word
or syllable; 2) the /ae/
sound is usually spelled
_ay_ when it shows up at the
end of a word or syllable.

**Advanced High**
Observe whether
students are able to
correctly identify vowel
team /ae/ and _ay_ words.


~~**ELPS 4.C**~~


Activity Page 4.1




- Tell students that today’s lesson will focus on two vowel teams that represent
the /ae/ sound.


- Remind students that they have already learned one spelling for this sound:
the split digraph _a_e_ . Have students turn to a partner and discuss what they
know about the split digraph _a_e._


- Tell students that today they will focus on the long vowel sound /ae/, as in
_gait_ . Have students say the sound /ae/.


- Direct students to find the /ae/ sound on their Individual Code Chart. Explain
that the /ae/ sound can be spelled _ai_ or _ay_ .


- Display Spell Words with Vowel Teams, and review the rules for spelling words
with the /ae/ sound. Explain that the /ae/ sound is usually spelled _ai_ when
it shows up at the beginning or in the middle of a word or syllable. Point to
the _ai_ in the middle of _wait_ or at the beginning of _aim_ . Point out that _ai_ is not
usually at the end of words because English words generally do not end in ‘i’.


- Explain that the /ae/ sound is usually spelled _ay_ when it shows up at the end
of a word or syllable. Point to the _ay_ at the end of _day_ and at the end of the
first syllable in _maybe_ .


- Write the word _mainstay_ on the board.


- Explain the meaning of _mainstay_ : something that is very important and
always there. Provide an example in context: _Mr. Smith, the friendly librarian,_
_is a mainstay at our school library; he’s always there to help us find great_
_books to read_ .


- Underline the _ae_ sound-spelling pattern in each syllable.


- Point to _ai_ in _main_, and ask students to notice that the vowel team is in the
middle of the first syllable.


- Point to _ay_ in _stay_, and ask students to observe the vowel team at the end of
the second syllable.


- Explain to students that they will now orally spell words with the ai or ay
vowel pattern. Model the procedure: Teacher says: _unafraid_ . Student:
Repeats. Unafraid. /u/ /a/ /ae/. Spells: u-n-a-f-r-ai-d. Restates word:
_unafraid_ . Student then spells the word orally and repeats the word.


- Repeat using the rest of the words ( _railway_, _entertain_, _hooray_, _castaway_, and
_available)_ with different students aloud. Have the rest of the students listen
to identify where /ae/ sound is located within the word each student spells.

    - “Check that your loops and tails are formed smoothly and connect to the
next letter.”


    - “Focus on keeping your letters of uniform size and proportion.”


  - Tell students that after they write each word, they should use a slash mark to
divide each word into syllables and underline the vowel team in each word.


  - Read the following words: _betray_, _explain_, _delay_, _abstain_, _aimlessly_, _prepaid_,
_swaying_, _praiseworthy_, and _restraining_ .


  - Ask students to write a sentence using one of the words on the page. Have

cruise? _(Tisha and her dad saw parrot ish and giant clams.)_


2. **Inferential.** What is the most likely reason Tisha does not want to admit to
Dad that she was excited to try snorkeling? _(She did not want him to know_
_she was beginning to like Australia.)_


3. **Evaluative.** What is the most likely reason the author uses the word
_mainstay_ when referring to the snacks on p. 14? _(to show that Dad and_
_Tisha needed/depended on those snacks because they would be gone for a_

that help the reader know what the word _sustain_ means. (Answers may vary,
but should include the words _helps_ and _life_ .)


  - Ask students to predict what _sustain_ means.


  - Use the glossary to determine the meaning of the word. Ask students if the

definition matches what they predicted based on context clues.


  - Preview the following vocabulary words that students will encounter in this

section of the Reader. Have students work with a partner to decode the
words in isolation first and go over the correct pronunciation of each word.


**refrain, v.,** stopping oneself from doing something

Example: The animals are interesting and unique in Australia but refrain
from getting too close because they can be harmful.


**sustain, v.,** to support with food

Example: There have been efforts to sustain the Great Barrier Reef’s
ecosystem to support its natural beauty.


**display**
**1. n.,** a performance or showing of something

Example: The tiger shark opened his mouth and showed a humongous
display of teeth.

  - Ask the student to whisper the word to themselves and decide if the word
has a short /oo/ sound, as in look or a long /oo/ sound, as in mood.


  - Ask students to silently walk to the board and place their sticky note on the
side of the chart it belongs to, short /oo/ sound or long /oo/ sound.


  - Tell students that today’s lesson focuses on reviewing the _oo_ vowel team.


  - Direct students to find the /oo/ and /oo/ sounds on their Individual Code Chart.


  - Ask: Which sounds does the _oo_ spelling pattern represent? Remind students
that there are two.


  - Student: Short /oo/, as in _look_, and long /oo/, as in _mood_


  - Ask: What strategy can you use to read the correct sound in a word? _(Try_
_the long /oo/ sound and short /oo/ sound to see which one sounds right and_
_makes sense in the context.)_


  - Say and write the word _cartoonish_ on the board or chart paper. Guide
students in syllabicating, decoding, and repeating the word.


    - Note: Model shifting and identifying the correct sound of spelling _oo_ in

~~**CHORAL READ THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain that today students will reread the previous section of Chapter 3, _The_
_Other Side of the World,_ pages 20–25.

 - **Note:** Each time students encounter a new section of text in the Reader, the
lesson includes new vocabulary words and/or phrases to accompany the
section of text. There are lessons in which students reread sections of the
Reader, for the purpose of building fluency. These lessons do not introduce
new vocabulary or have a vocabulary chart.


 - Tell students that today’s reading fluency focus is on accuracy (reading
words correctly).


 - Direct students to page 20 in the Reader. As students locate the page in the
Reader, pass out a few sticky notes to each student.


 - Instruct students to listen to you model the first two sentences practicing
accuracy. If you make any mistakes, correct it and read the word in the
sentence again correctly.


 - Then instruct students to read aloud. Remind them that today we are
practicing accuracy so if there is a word that they have messed up, go back
and read it correctly. If there are any unfamiliar words, have students mark
the word in the passage with a sticky note.


 - Ask: Were there any words in the reading that were unfamiliar? Did you mark
any words in the passage with a sticky note? _(Go over unfamiliar words, use_
_the Glossary or a dictionary to help define unfamiliar words as a class.)_


 - After going over any unfamiliar words, have students reread the passage.
They should be able to read it more accurately the second time through
because the words should all be familiar.


 - As you listen to students read, make notes regarding accuracy in the
Anecdotal Reading Record and provide immediate and corrective feedback,
such as, “If you come across a word that is tricky to read accurately sound it
out or use context clues to help figure out the word.”


 - When discussing the Reader or strategic prompts, remind students to speak
at an appropriate rate and volume while maintaining eye contact. Choose
strategic prompts to check for comprehension and students’ ability to use
context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or multiple-meaning words.
Example prompts include:

Challenge


Ask students to create

a Tic-Tac-Toe board on

a sheet of paper. Tell
students to brainstorm
nine words with the _ew, ue_,
and _ui_ spelling patterns.
Students write one of the
words they brainstormed
in each of the spaces on
the game board. Students
take turns playing TicTac-Toe. When placing a
_x_ or an _o_ on a space, ask
students to say the word
and use it in a sentence.




 - Ask: What is a typical spelling rule that can be applied to the spelling patterns
_ew, ue_, or, _ui_ ? _(Typically, the ew and ue spelling patterns appear at the end of a_
_syllable, while the ui spelling pattern appears in the middle of a syllable.)_


 - Ask for student volunteers to recall the words with the /oo/ sound from the
previous lesson. ( _barbeque, juicy, chewing, clueless, and suited_ )


~~**PRACTICE WITH SPEAK AND SPELL (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students open to Activity Page 9.1. Gather the prepared index cards.


 - Instruct students to listen carefully for the syllables and sounds as you say a
word.


 - Say the word on the first card: _cashew_ .


 - Hold up the card to display the word.


 - Repeat the word _cashew_ . Orally stretch the sounds or chunk the syllables.


 - Instruct students to say the word and clap the syllables as they say it.


 - Demonstrate on the board how to move the word parts to their appropriate
syllable boxes on the activity page.


 - Instruct students to do the same with each word they hear, writing its
syllables in the boxes on Activity Page 9.1. Direct students to then say the
word and clap the syllables themselves.


 - Repeat the process with each word: _fruitfulness, bruises, renewing, and_
_jewelry_ .


 - Review the answers with the class. Have students circle the vowel teams _ew_,

_ue,_ or _ui_ in each word.


 - Then have students complete the last part of the activity independently.
Students will take these two fragment sentences and convert them into
complete sentences. Remind students that complete sentences need a noun
(who/what) and a verb (in this case the verb is provided), along with correct
capitalization and punctuation.


   - pursue new activities _(Answers may vary but could include the sentence,_
_“Tisha decided to pursue new activities when she visited the cultural_

 - Preview the following vocabulary words that students will encounter in this
section of the Reader. Have students work with a partner to decode the
words in isolation first and go over the correct pronunciation of each word.


**mammal, n.,** an animal that gives birth, has hair, feeds milk from its own
body to its young, and is warm blooded

Example: The mammal took care of its young by feeding them.


**platypus, n.,** an Australian mammal that has fur and also has a wide bill, a
long flat tail, and webbed feet like a duck

Example: The platypus swam into the water.


**sanctuary, n.,** a safe place

Example: The veterinary clinic was a sanctuary for the injured animals.

 - Conduct a brief discussion about the different words in the chart. For
example, show the words and ask students what prior knowledge they may
have about these words and where they might have seen them.


 - Model how to use the Glossary in the Reader to discover the pronunciation
and definition of words in bold. Review the definition together and ask
students to share their understanding of the word. Call on a few students to
share their thoughts.


 - Ask students to work with a partner to find the word _mammal_ in the
dictionary. Provide feedback on using the alphabet and guide words, as
needed.


 - Point out that each entry in the dictionary also provides the part of speech.
The part of speech is located beside the word. This helps the reader know if
the word is a noun, verb, adjective, or other part of speech.


 - Ask students to determine what part of speech the word mammal is. _(It is a_
_noun.)_


 - Ask students, “What is a noun?” _(A noun is a person, place, or thing.)_

- Model fluent reading for the first two sentences and focus on reading
accurately. When coming across a multisyllabic word that is unfamiliar,
pause, sound it out while pointing to it, then reread it.


- Have students read with reading partners aloud (use past observations and
assessments to determine partners). Students should focus on reading
accurately.


- As you listen to students read, make notes regarding accuracy and their
individual reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record and provide
immediate and corrective feedback such as, “The words _information,_
_discovered,_ and _mainland_ are all multisyllabic words. If you point to chunks of
the word and read each syllable separately then you can read it again faster
to get the word.”


- Choose strategic prompts to check for comprehension as well as to check
for their ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or
multiple-meaning words. Example prompts include:


1. **Literal.** What animals did Dad and Tisha see at the Lone Pine Koala
Sanctuary? _(They saw koala bears, kangaroos, and a platypus.)_


2. **Inferential.** What can you infer about the meaning of the word _pamphlet_
in the text? What words in the text help you figure it out? _(A pamphlet_
_is a booklet with information. Clues in the text: Dad grabbed a colorful_
_pamphlet about koalas as they strolled through the sanctuary to pursue_
_new activities, and started to read.)_


3. **Evaluative.** What key characteristics do koalas have to help them survive
in nature? How are koalas similar to other animals we have discussed?
How are koalas different? _(They have strong arms and sharp claws to_
_help them get food. They have good hearing to help them listen for danger._
_They are similar to kangaroos because they are also marsupials. They are_
_different because they are mammals, while emus and ostriches are not.)_


- Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses
given the following sentence stems:


  - Dad and Tish saw . . .

  - The word pamphlet means . . .

 - Tell students in the last lesson, we learned how to spell multisyllabic words
with vowel teams. Turn to a partner, and discuss the typical spelling rule that
can be applied to the spelling patterns _ew, ue_, or, _ui_ ? ( _Typically, the ew and ue_
_spelling patterns appear at the end of a syllable, while the ui spelling pattern_
_appears in the middle of a syllable._ )


 - Activate prior knowledge by posting an abbreviation and its full form and ask
students to make observations: _WWII/World War II._


 - Have students turn to a partner and discuss other abbreviations they are
already familiar with.


 - Tell students that today’s lesson will focus on abbreviations.


 - Create a chart as a class with three columns: _Abbreviation/Acronym/_
_Initialism_ . Provide clear definitions for each of the two types of abbreviations.
As you define for students, add examples to the chart.


 - _Abbreviations_ are a shortened form of a word or phrase that can speed up
communication (i.e. _vs_ . for _versus_ and _dept_ . for _department_ ). Have students
turn and talk about any other abbreviations they can think of as a group.


 - An _acronym_ is a word formed from the first letters of a series of words,
pronounced as a word in its own right. (NASA is an acronym for National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. The letters are pronounced as a
single word, “Nasa.”)


 - An _initialism_ is a word formed from the first letters of a series of words,
but the letters are pronounced individually. (FBI is an initialism for Federal
Bureau of Investigation. The letters are pronounced as F-B-I).


 - Present examples listed in the lesson to students and have them collaborate
and decide where they go in the chart and then have students generate
others that they know: _NBA, BFF, LOL, TV, UFO, DIY, Ave,_ and _SOS._


 - Add abbreviations from the text to the chart after students encounter them.

 - Tell students that they will work with affixes today. Ask students to turn and
talk to discuss what an affix is and how those letters change the meaning of a
word. Encourage students to use the sentence stems “An affix is . . . ” and “An
example of an affix is . . . ”


 - Remind students that prefixes are a type of affix that come before the base
word and suffixes are a type of affix that come after the base word.


 - Explain that the prefix _anti–_ means “opposite” or “against.” Tell students
that the affix _ant–_ also means “opposite” or “against.” Ask students to turn
to their elbow partner and list any words they know that begin with _anti–_ or
_ant–_ .


 - Write the base word _arctic_ on the board. Add the prefix _ant–_ to the beginning
of the word.


 - Have students turn and talk to a partner about what changed in the word

_arctic/antarctic._


 - Underline the affix _ant–_ and divide the word into syllables: Ant/arc/tic/a.


 - Display a world map.


 - Ask a volunteer to point to Antarctica and then point to the Arctic region on

the map.


 - Ask: What do you think the word _Antarctica_ means? _(It is opposite the Arctic_
_on a map.)_


 - Tell students that the prefix _in–_ means “not” or “non.”


 - Write the word base word _expense_ . Add the suffix _–ive_ to make the word
_expensive_ . Have students turn and talk about what _expensive_ means
(Students can use a dictionary to help define the word if needed). Then add
the prefix _in–_ to make the word _inexpensive_ on the board.


 - Underline the affix _in–_ and divide the word into syllables: in/ex/pen/sive.


 - Tell students the word _expensive_ means to cost a lot of money. Ask: What
does the word inexpensive mean? _(not expensive)_


 - Have students break up the following words into a prefix and base word:

_antibacterial, invalid,_ and _incapable_ . Have students discuss the meaning of
each of the words. Ask: Do the prefixes help you understand the meaning of
the words?

immediate and corrective feedback, such as, “The speed that you are
reading at is great! I like how you are slowing down for important details and
speeding up for less crucial information.”


- After several minutes, have students evaluate each other’s reading by giving
each other positive feedback. Point out the sentence stems from Partner
Reading Feedback (TR 11.2). Listen for effective student feedback. For
example:


  - _You read faster and more accurately as we practiced._

  - _You did a great job when you read with expression._

  - _You corrected yourself when you made an error._

  - _I like when you read with excitement when you read about comets._

 - Display a Word Matrix to use for this activity.


 - Have the teacher write the base word _motion_ in cursive on the board under
Base Words. Have students read the word and have students turn and talk
about what _motion_ means.


 - Tell students that the affix _pro–_ means “forward” and can also mean “for.” The
prefix and suffix always mean the same thing, but it changes the meaning of
the base word. Then apply the prefix _pro–_ to the word _motion_, write _pro–_ in
the Prefixes column of the Word Matrix.


 - Ask: What is the new word and can you break this word into syllables?

_(promotion; pro/mo/tion)_


 - Write this sentence from the Reader on the board: _Tisha’s mom got a promotion_
_that demanded her to work from the company’s headquarters in Brisbane._


 - Direct students to turn and talk with a partner and discuss what the word

_promotion_ means. Use the prefix, base word, and context from the sentence.


 - Keep the _pro–_ in the Word Matrix and change the base word to _long_ . Model
writing in cursive the base word _long_ in the Word Matrix. Have students read
the word and have students turn and talk about what _long_ means.


 - Students will work with a partner to add the prefix _pro–_ to the word _long_ . Ask
students what this new word is. ( _prolong)_


 - Have students discuss with their partner about the meaning of _prolong_ . If
there’s time, have students add a suffix to the end of _prolong_ . Ask: Does
adding a suffix change the meaning? _(yes)_


 - Have students repeat these steps independently using a whiteboard or piece
of paper. Have students separate the paper or board into three columns for
_Prefixes_, _Base Words_, and _Suffixes_ to replicate the Word Matrix. Give students
a base word and have them apply the prefix _pro–_ and whatever suffix they
can think of to make a multisyllabic word. Base words: _act, claim,_ and _found._
_Ask students whether adding a suffix changes the meaning._


 - If there’s time, have students share their words they made using the Word
Matrix with the class. Have students create sentences using the new words.

 - Explain that today students will read Chapter 7 of _The Other Side of the_
_World_ .


 - Guide the class in reading the next section of _The Other Side of the World_,
pages 46–49.

 - Preview the following vocabulary words that students will encounter in this
section of the Reader. Have students work with a partner to decode the
words in isolation first and go over the correct pronunciation of each word.
**prominent, adj.,** something that stands out and is very noticeable

Example: Everyone stared at the prominent basketball player who was over
seven feet tall.


**trinket, n.,** an object small in size and has little to no value

Example: The child carried the trinkets in his pocket.

 - Conduct a brief discussion about the different words in the chart. For
example, show the words and ask students what prior knowledge they may
have about these words and where they might have seen them. Additionally,
have students decode any unfamiliar words and discuss the correct
pronunciation of each.


 - Model how to use the Glossary in the Reader to discover the pronunciation

and definition of words in bold. Review the definition together and ask
students to share their understanding of the word. Call on a few students to
share their thoughts.


 - Ask students to determine which word will come first in the dictionary:

_prominent_ or _trinket_ . _(Prominent will come first in the dictionary.)_


 - Ask students which letter did they have to go to in the word to determine the
order? _(They had to look at the first letter.)_

- Model fluent reading for the first two sentences on page 46 and point out the
word _comfortable_ . Break up the word into syllables, point out the suffix _–able_
and read the word again in the first sentence.


- Guide the class in reading pages 46–49 of _The Other Side of the World_ .

- Pair students with intentional reading partners by using past assessments
and observations.


- Direct them to partner read this section, alternating paragraphs.


- As you listen to students read, listen for students decoding multisyllabic
words with prefixes and suffixes. Make notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record. Provide feedback by saying,
“Break up the words into syllable sounds if needed, notice if there are any
prefixes or suffixes. Then say the word again with all the sounds.”


- Choose strategic prompts to check for comprehension as well as to check
for their ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or
multiple-meaning words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant
questions to clarify any information from the Reader or strategic prompts.
Example prompts include:


1. **Literal.** What historical information about women’s soccer did Tisha
learn from Rebecca’s visit? _(Tisha learned that Brisbane’s first_
_prominent_ _women’s soccer game was in 1921.)_


2. **Inferential.** How does the talk Rebecca gave about Australia’s National
Team influence Tisha’s feelings about living in Australia? _(Tisha loved_
_soccer back in Houston and she learns that soccer is also very popular in_
_Australia, so she is getting more comfortable with her new home.)_


3. **Evaluative** . What details on page 49 support the key idea that women’s
soccer is very popular in Australia? _(the Matildas were in the Olympics_
_semi-finals, there is increased interest in the sport, there are soccer clubs_
_for kids, schools are provided with equipment and coaches for programs.)_


- Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses
given the following sentence stems:


  - Tisha learned that . . .

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today, the students will begin the multi-part Assessment. In the first part,
you will work one-on-one with students to complete the Fluency Assessment.
Students will engage in a review activity while awaiting their turn for the
assessment. Remind students to use a whisper voice, since testing will be
taking place concurrently with other activities.


You will most likely need more than one day to test each student; you may
plan on using time during the following lesson to complete the Fluency
Assessment.


The second part of the assessment takes place in the next lesson. It is a
reading and spelling exercise targeting each of the skills taught in Unit 8.


**Foundational Skills**

  - Predetermine student pairs to play Roll, Flip, Read, Write.


  - Cut out and make one set of Roll, Flip, Read, Write Word Cards for each student.


  - Gather dice.


**Reading**

  - Gather books of varying complexity for students to choose from during SelfSustained Reading time.


  - Make copies of the Self-Sustained Reading Tracker (TR 14.3) for students to
record their reading progress during independent reading time.


**Universal Access**

  - Consider using oversized dice for easier grip and use.

Students will read and spell homophones.

~~**TEKS 3.1.B; TEKS 3.1.D; TEKS 3.1.E; TEKS 3.2.B.ii; TEKS 3.2.D; TEKS 3.3.D**~~


Students will read and spell words with prefixes.

~~**TEKS 3.1.B; TEKS 3.1.D; TEKS 3.1.E; TEKS 3.2.A.v; TEKS 3.2.B.vi; TEKS 3.2.D**~~


Students will read and spell words with the _anti–_, _in–_, and _pro–_ affixes.

~~**TEKS 3.1.B; TEKS 3.1.D; TEKS 3.1.E; TEKS 3.2.D; TEKS 3.3.C**~~


Students will self-select a text and read independently for a sustained period of
time. ~~**[TEKS 3.5 ]**~~


~~**PLAY ROLL, FLIP, READ, WRITE (15 MIN.)**~~


                  - Tell students in the last lesson, we learned about words that have the affixes
_pro–, in–, and anti–_ . Turn to a partner, and brainstorm a list of words that begin
with these affixes.


                  - Explain that students will be called individually to take their Fluency
Assessment. While they are waiting their turn, they will play a game to review
the unit skills. Students should use whisper voices because their peers will be
concurrently testing as they play the review game.


                 - Move students into pairs. Provide each pair with a die. Provide each student
with their own set of Roll, Flip, Read, Write word cards (TR 14.1) numbered from
1–6 on the back. Point out that numbers repeat; the same number will be found
on multiple cards. Have students open to Activity Page 14.1.


                 - Review the game directions:


                        - Have students lay cards face down on the table or floor in front of them,
careful to keep their cards separate from their partner’s cards.


                        - To play, have a student roll the die, then flip over a card that corresponds to

the number on the die and read the word on the card. If the student rolls a
number that matches multiple cards, he or she may pick any card with the
same number.


**TEKS 3.1.B** Follow, restate, and give oral instructions that involve a series of related sequences of action; **TEKS 3.1.D** Work

   - If the student reads the word correctly, he or she leaves the card face up.

   - If the student does not read it correctly, he or she flips it back over and

the turn ends.


   - The first student to flip and read all their cards wins!


 - Remind students to speak politely to their partner in all situations. Have
students restate the instructions for the game before they begins.


 - After the game ends, have partners work together to complete Activity Page
14.1, writing their responses in cursive. Provide immediate and corrective
feedback such as, “Ensure that your letters are properly spaced and don’t
run into each other.” Using a dictionary to define the words if needed.


~~**SELF-SUSTAINED READING (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Students will be reading independently and quietly while peers continue to

take the Fluency Assessment.


 - Transition students into quiet reading time.


 - Use a previously established protocol for selecting recreational reading

materials.


 - Allow students to find comfortable places around the classroom to read.


 - Remind students of the expectations for quiet independent reading and the

importance of building reading stamina.


 - Suggest ways to maintain focus while reading, such as separating the text

into chunks and taking short breaks between chunks or using a shield to
block out distractions.


Check for Understanding


Encourage students to keep track of the books they are reading and the pages on

which they started and ended. Remind students to keep track of their reading prog

Lesson 14 Fluency Assessment
**121**


Activity Pages
14.2, 14.3



~~**FLUENCY ASSESSMENT**~~


 - You will work individually with each student and take a running record of the
student’s oral reading of a text. For this assessment, you will take a simple,
easily calculated measure of the student’s fluency by seeing how long it takes
the student to read the text. Allow each student three minutes to read the
story. Students with proficient fluency should be able to complete the text in
this amount of time. Instruct students to speak coherently and complete the
comprehension questions after reading the text.


 - Have one student at a time come to a quiet assessment area to read _Marco’s_
_Family Trip_ with you.


 - Ask the student for Activity Page 14.2 (Fluency Assessment) and Activity
Page 14.3 (Fluency Assessment Questions).


 - Tell the student that you will ask him or her to read the story aloud.


 - Explain that you will use a watch to see how long it takes them to read the
story. Tell the student that this is not a race; they should read at their regular
pace and not rush.


 - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the title. If you are
using a watch, write the exact Start Time, in minutes and seconds, on your
record page.


 - If you are using a stopwatch, you do not need to write down the start time

because the stopwatch will calculate Elapsed Time.


 - As the student reads the story, make a running record on the copy with the
student’s name using the following guidelines:







|Word Read Correctly|No mark is required.|
|---|---|
|**Omissions**|Draw a long dash above the word<br>omitted.|
|**Insertions**|Write a caret (^) at the point where the<br>insertion was made.<br>If you have time, write down the word<br>that was inserted.|
|**Words Read Incorrectly**|Write an ‘X’ above the word.|
|**Substitutions**|Write the substitution above the word.|
|**Self-Corrected Errors**|Replace original error mark with an ‘SC.’|
|**Teacher-Supplied Words**|Write a ‘T’ above the word. (counts as an<br>error)|


Foundational Skills 8
**122**


- When the student finishes reading the story, write the exact Finish Time in
minutes and seconds on your record sheet.


- Alternatively, if you are using a stopwatch, simply write down the Elapsed
Time in minutes and seconds.


- If the student reads slowly, you may need to stop it before the student gets to
the story’s end. If the student does not read to the end, draw a vertical line on
the record sheet to indicate how far the student read. Also, write down either
the Finish Time or the Elapsed Time.


- Repeat this process for each additional student.


Activity Page 14.3: Fluency Assessment


- If the reading was fairly accurate (<10 uncorrected errors), you can get a
rough (and easy) estimate of a student’s W.C.P.M. score simply by noting the
time and looking at the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet (TR 14.2).


- To calculate a student’s exact W.C.P.M. score, follow the described steps.


  - First, complete the Words section of the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.

  - Count Words Read. This is the total number of words that the student

read or attempted to read, up to the point where they stopped. It
includes words that the student read correctly and words they read
incorrectly or skipped over. If the student attempted to read the whole
story, including the title, use 345 words as your total. If the student did
not finish the story, you must count the number of words they tried to
read. Write the count for Words Read in the matching box on the W.C.P.M.
Calculation Sheet.


  - Count the Uncorrected Mistakes noted in your running record. This

includes words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and words
that you had to supply. Write the total in the box labeled Uncorrected
Mistakes. (A mistake that the student corrects is not counted as a
mistake; the student is penalized for the time he or she lost making the
correction, but not for the initial mistake.)


  - Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get Words Correct.

  - Next, complete the Time section of the activity page.

  - Calculate Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a

stopwatch, this will be done for you. Skip to the next step.) If you used a
watch and recorded start and stop times, you will need to subtract the
Start Time from the Finish Time to calculate the Elapsed Time. Subtract

seconds from seconds, then minutes from minutes. Calculate Time in
Seconds. Multiply the number of minutes by 60 to convert minutes to
seconds, and then add the number of seconds.


  - Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then multiply by 60 to get

Words Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.).


- As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, consider the following factors:


  - It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.

scores. However, a major goal for Grade 3 students is to read with
sufficient fluency to ensure comprehension and independent reading of
school assignments in subsequent grades. Exact fluency targets vary
from state to state; the national mean calculated by Hasbrouck and
Tindal in 2017 for Spring of Grade 3 is 112 W.C.P.M.


  - A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared with the score of other

students in the classroom (or grade level) and also with the national
fluency norms for Spring of Grade 3 obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal.
Students whose scores are below the 25th percentile (91 W.C.P.M.), are
experiencing serious problems in reading fluently.


- Compare the student’s W.C.P.M. score to national norms for Spring of Grade

3 (Hasbrouck and Tindal, 2017):







|Reading Time for<br>this Text|W.C.P.M.|National Percen-<br>tiles for Spring,<br>Grade 3|
|---|---|---|
|**2:35**|166|90th|
|**3:05**|139|75th|
|**4:05**|112|50th|
|**5:55**|91|25th|
|**8:00**|63|10th|


After you have entered each student’s scores on the Unit 8 W.C.P.M.
Calculation Sheet, record them on the Grade 3 End-of-Year Summary.

do any combination of the exercises listed below, in any order. The exercises
are listed by unit objectives. You may find that different students need extra
practice with different objectives. It can be helpful to have students focus on
specific exercises in small groups.

~~**MORE HELP WITH DECODING WORDS**~~


**Moon Shot**

 - Have students turn to PP.1.


 - Move students into pairs. Provide each pair with a Moon Shot Game Board,
Oh No! Cards, and Good to Go! Cards. Provide each student with a set of
Moon Shot Word Cards. Provide small tokens as playing pieces.


 - Review the game instructions:


   - Students take turns drawing word cards. The student then reads the word
and explains what the word on the card means to their partner.


   - If a student reads and explains the word correctly, he or she can draw a
Good to Go! card and follow the directions on the card.


   - If a student does not explain the word correctly, he or she will draw a card
from the Oh No! pile and follow the directions on that card.


   - The first student to make it to the moon is the winner!


~~**MORE HELP WITH HOMOPHONES**~~


**Homophone Memory**

 - Move students into partners. Distribute a set of Homophone Pair Cards to
each pair.


 - Explain that the students will practice matching words with their
homophones.


 - Direct partners to lay out the cards face down on the table. Partners will
take turns flipping over two cards. If the homophones match, the student
should remove the matching cards from the table. If they are not, the cards
should be flipped back over. Play continues until all pairs have been made.


~~**MORE HELP WITH ABBREVIATIONS**~~


**Abbreviation Memory**

 - Move students into partners, and distribute a set of Abbreviation Match
Cards to each pair.


 - Explain that the students will practice matching words with their
abbreviations.


 - Direct partners to lay out the cards face down on the table. Partners will
take turns flipping over two cards. If the abbreviations match, the student
should remove the matching cards from the table. If they are not, the cards
should be flipped back over. Play continues until all pairs have been made.



Foundational Skills 8

**Abbreviation Review**

 - Invite students to research abbreviations in a subject of interest to
them (e.g., video game, sports, science). Have students create a list of
abbreviations and share them with a partner. Each partner should attempt
to decode the abbreviations.


 - Provide students with more opportunities to work with abbreviations. Provide
a list of common abbreviations mixed with a few abbreviations they are less
likely to know and their meanings. Have students match each abbreviation to
its meaning.


~~**MORE HELP WITH AFFIXES**~~


**Mix and Mingle**

 - Explain that students will play a game called Mix and Mingle to create as

many words using affixes as possible.


 - Have students turn to PP.3.


   - Pass out one Mix and Mingle word card per student. Note: Some words
are repeated, and you may copy more if you have more than 20 students.


   - Explain that once the timer begins, students will “mix and mingle”
with each other to create words using their flashcards. Once they’ve
combined their flashcards to create a word, they must each individually
write the word down. They will then repeat the process to create a new
word with different students.


   - Remind students that in order for their word to count, it must be spelled
correctly. Direct students to write words in cursive.


   - Begin the timer and release students to play the game.

   - Refocus the class. Ask for student volunteers to share the words they
created. Review the correct spellings for words that students spelled
incorrectly.


   - Extend the activity by having students write sentences using the words
they created. Remind students to write neatly in cursive, leaving space
between words.


**Play Roll, Flip, Read, Write**

 - Have students turn to PP.2.


 - Move students into pairs. Provide each pair with a die. Provide each student
with their own set of Roll, Flip, Read, Write word cards numbered from 1–6 on
the back. Point out that numbers repeat; the same number will be found on
multiple cards.

**133**


                        - Review the game directions: Have students lay cards face down on the
table or floor in front of them, careful to keep their cards separate from
their partner’s cards.


                        - To play, have a student roll the die, then flip over a card that corresponds
to the number on the die and read the word on the card. If the student
rolls a number that matches multiple cards, he or she may pick any card
with the same number.


                        - If the student reads the word correctly, he or she leaves the card face up.

                        - If the student does not read it correctly, he or she flips it back over and
the turn ends.


                        - The first student to flip and read all their cards wins!


**Affix Match Puzzle Cards**

                 - Move students into pairs. Provide pairs with a set of words and definition

cards. Have students match each word with the prefix pro— with its
definition. Then, have students check their work with another group.
If students find that their definitions do not match, provide access to
dictionaries to check for accuracy.


                - When students are finished and have correctly matched each word and

definition, have students create 3–5 sentences using at least one of the
words in each sentence.


**Vowel Teams, Homophones, and Affixes Review**

                 - Write the following words on the board: _vowel teams, homophones,_ and
_affixes_ .


                 - Give students two minutes to write examples of each of those terms.


                 - Have students turn to a partner and share what they wrote. (Examples: vowel

team words with _ai_, _ay_, _oo_, _ew_, _ue_, _ui_, _ew_, _ue_, _ui_ ; homophones: _bear/bare,_
_their/there/they’re; words with affixes anti–, in–, pro–)_

###### Grade 3 Foundational Skills Record

Teacher Instructions: Create one copy of the Foundational Skills Record per student. Use
assessments within the unit to track the student’s progress toward mastery of each standard. Use
the rating system to indicate the level of teacher support required and the space provided to take
notes.


  - Students at level 1 require focused instruction to accelerate learning in a specific area. Use the

Additional Supports and Pausing Points to target areas of growth.


  - Students at levels 2 and 3 should be showing steady growth. These students would benefit from the
Take Home Materials and side-bar support suggestions within each lesson.


  - Students at level 4 are excelling. Use the side-bar challenge suggestions to increase rigor.

###### Grade 3 Fluency Record

Choose texts from the Grade 3 Fluency Packet or the Unit Readers for students to read aloud
as you measure their pace and accuracy. Subtract the Words Missed (words that are omitted,
mispronounced, or substituted for another word) from the Total Words in Text to determine the
number of Words Read Correctly. Divide the Words Read Correctly by the Total Words in Text to
determine the students’ accuracy. Record how long it takes the students to read the passage to
determine their Words Per Minute. Consider both accuracy and pace as well as expression when
evaluating a student’s overall fluency.

**Reading Assessment Scoring and Analysis**


The more words a student can read and the farther the
student can progress in the assessment, the stronger his or
her preparation for the next unit of instruction.


The number of words read correctly indicates the following:


  - Students who score 6 or fewer words out of 10 words
correctly have minimal preparation for the next unit.


  - Students who score 7 out of 10 words correctly have
adequate preparation for the next unit.


  - Students who score 8 or more words out of 10 words
correctly have outstanding preparation for the next
unit.


After scoring the assessment, you might find it helpful to
determine which phonemes students missed that caused
them to score below the benchmark for word recognition.

#### Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program


~~**THE SIMPLE VIEW OF READING**~~


Virtually everyone who writes about reading now recognizes that reading comprehension requires
more than just decoding ability. Many reading researchers now subscribe to a view of reading that
is known as “the simple view of reading.” This view, which is associated with reading researchers
Philip Gough and William Tunmer, holds that there are two chief elements that are crucially
important to reading comprehension: decoding skills and language comprehension ability.


To achieve reading comprehension, a person needs to be able to decode the words on the page and
then make sense of those words. The first task is made possible by decoding skills and the second
by language comprehension ability. If the person cannot decode the words on the page, she will not
be able to achieve reading comprehension, no matter how much oral language she can understand.
Even if the person can decode the words on the page, that in and of itself is still no guarantee of
reading comprehension. Thus, if a person cannot understand sentences when they hear them,
they are unlikely to understand those sentences when reading. Supporters of the simple view—and
there are a growing number of them among reading researchers—argue that a person’s reading
comprehension ability can be predicted, with a high degree of accuracy, based on two basic
measures. The first is a measure of decoding skills (e.g., a test of single word reading or pseudoword reading). The second is a measure of listening comprehension. Researchers who hold to the
simple view say, “Tell me a person’s decoding ability, as ascertained by a word-reading task, and
tell me that person’s language comprehension ability, as ascertained by a listening comprehension
task, and I can make a very accurate prediction of that person’s reading comprehension ability.” If
the person is a rapid and accurate decoder and able to understand a wide range of oral language—
for instance, classroom presentations, news items on the radio or TV, books on tape, etc.—then it is
a safe bet the person will also do well on tests of reading comprehension.


An interesting thing about the simple view of reading is that it can be expressed as an equation:





In this equation, each of the letters is a variable that stands for a specific skill:


R is a measure of reading comprehension ability.


D is a measure of decoding skills.


C is a measure of language-comprehension ability as measured using a listening task.


**194** Foundational Skills 8


Each of these skills can be quantified as a numerical value between 0 and 1, where 0 stands for no
ability whatsoever and 1 stands for perfect, not-to-be-improved-upon ability. Most people have a
skill level that falls somewhere between these two extremes.


The equation says that if you have some decoding ability (D > 0) and you also have some language
comprehension ability (C > 0), you will probably also have some reading comprehension ability (R

 - 0). How much reading comprehension ability you have will depend on the exact values of D and
C.


What does it mean to have no decoding ability (D = 0)? It means you cannot turn printed words
into spoken words. A person who cannot decode letters on a page cannot read. The person is
illiterate.


What does it mean to have no language comprehension ability (C = 0)? It means you do not know
the language, and you cannot understand any of it when you hear other people speaking or reading
aloud in that language.


It is not very common for a person to have decoding ability (D > 0) but not language
comprehension ability (C = 0). Why would you learn to read and write a language you cannot
understand? It does happen. One famous example involves the English poet John Milton, the
author of Paradise Lost and other well-known poems. Milton went blind late in life. Since Braille had
not yet been invented, this meant he could not read for himself. Nevertheless, Milton found a way
to keep learning from books: he had friends and relatives read the books aloud for him. However,
he was not always able to find a scholar who had the free time and the ability needed to read to him
in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and other ancient languages. The solution? Milton taught his daughters
to decode these languages so they could read books in those languages aloud to him. Milton did
not teach his daughters the actual languages—the thousands of words and tens of thousands
of meanings. That would have been a difficult, time-consuming task. He only taught them the
rules they would need to turn letters into sounds. Thus, his daughters acquired solid decoding
skills for these languages (D > 0), but they would have scored a zero on any measure of language
comprehension (C = 0). They could turn symbols into sounds, but they had no idea what the
sounds meant. Milton, on the other hand, due to his blindness, had no functional decoding skills (D
= 0). However, by virtue of his great learning, he was able to understand Hebrew, Latin, and Greek
when they were read aloud to him (C > 0). Between Milton and his daughters, you might say, there
was reading comprehension (R), but the younger generation brought the decoding skills (D) and
the elderly poet brought the language comprehension (C).


The Milton example is an unusual one, but it is possible to give a less unusual one. A decent teacher
can teach you to decode Russian letters (or the letters used in many other writing systems) during
a couple days of intensive work. Since you already know a lot about reading, all you would need to
learn is which sound values the unfamiliar letters stand for. Once you learned that, you would be
able to sound out most of the words in the language, but nobody would claim that you are reading
Russian. You would have some rudimentary decoding skills (D > 0), but you would be lacking
language comprehension (C = 0). You would be able to pronounce words, but you would not be able
to make sense of them. Essentially, you would be doing what Milton’s daughters did.


Teacher Resources **195**


~~**HOW THESE IDEAS INFORM THIS PROGRAM**~~


Although this may seem very abstract and theoretical, there are two ideas here that are very
important for reading instruction and for understanding this program. The first important idea
is that reading comprehension depends crucially on both decoding skills (D) and language
comprehension ability (C); the second is that language comprehension ability takes much longer
to acquire than decoding skills.


Milton chose to teach his daughters decoding skills because he could teach those relatively
quickly. It would have taken him much, much longer to build up their language comprehension
abilities. Likewise, in the hypothetical example just given, a decent teacher could teach you to
decode Russian print in a few days of intensive instruction, but he or she would need to keep
working with you for many weeks—possibly even many years—to teach you enough Russian words
and phrases to understand a movie, make sense of a radio report, or read a short story.


You are facing a similar situation as a teacher in the early grades. You want your students to learn
to read. A crucial first step is to teach them decoding skills. Strong decoding skills can be taught
to most young children throughout Grades K–3. It takes longer to teach decoding skills to young
children who are learning to read for the first time than it does to teach the same skills to adults
who have already learned to read in another language, and it takes longer to teach decoding
skills in English-speaking countries because English spelling is rather complex; but even so,
most students can acquire basic decoding ability in the early grades. The children will continue
to automatize their decoding skills, learn new spelling patterns, and build fluency for many more
years, but the basics can be taught in Grades K–3.


That is not the case with language comprehension ability. It will take you and your school system
a long time to build up your students’ language comprehension ability because this is not a job
you can accomplish in a single school year. Rather, language comprehension ability is acquired
over many years. Your students began to develop a rudimentary ability to understand language
even before they could speak and continued to increase their language comprehension abilities
throughout the preschool years. They will make even more gains in your classroom and the
classrooms they join after yours. With each new sentence they read or hear, and each new subject
they study in school, they will be building up background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural
literacy, thus increasing the range of materials they are equipped to understand, first orally and
later via reading. The more you teach them and the more you expose them to, the more they will be
able to understand. It takes a long time to build up the vocabulary and knowledge needed to make
sense of most stories in a newspaper or magazine, but this buildup is crucial for your students’
reading abilities: no matter how good their decoding skills may be, they will not understand what
they read unless they have the language comprehension ability to make sense of the words they
decode.


The program includes two strands of instruction, and these strands correspond with the
elements of reading isolated in the simple view of reading. The Skills Strand is meant to build
students’ decoding skills (D), while the Knowledge Strand is meant to build students’ language
comprehension ability (C) by exposing them to vocabulary, concepts, and ideas through


**196** Foundational Skills 8


frequent reading aloud. It is important to understand that both strands are crucial for reading
comprehension in later grades. You may feel the decoding skills taught in the Skills Strand are
more important to teach in the early grades, and certainly, this is the area where you can expect to
have the most immediate impact, but it is important that you not neglect language comprehension
ability. Remember, it takes many years to build up enough vocabulary and general knowledge to
understand a wide range of printed materials. The building of background knowledge needs to
begin in kindergarten (if not before) and continue throughout the elementary and middle school
years.


If students are not building their language comprehension ability in the early grades, their reading
scores are likely to begin to fall off in Grade 4 and later. This has been called the “fourth-grade
slump,” and it occurs because material assessed on reading tests changes over time. As students’
progress through the grades, test questions focus less on rudimentary decoding skills and more
on comprehension—and comprehension depends on having sufficient vocabulary, background
knowledge, and cultural literacy to understand the words you are decoding. Thus, the importance
of language comprehension ability increases with time. A weakness in this area may not show up
on tests in early grades, but it will show up in later elementary grades.


This has been well documented in research. In one very interesting study, researchers at the
University of Kansas looked at measurements of reading comprehension (R), decoding/word
recognition (D), and listening comprehension (C) for the same 570 students in the second, fourth,
and eighth grades. They found the two factors D and C accurately predicted R in each grade,
but that C became more important, in the sense that it explained more of the variation among
students over time. The measure of decoding (D) was extremely important in the second-grade
results. Twenty-seven percent of the variance in reading comprehension in second grade could
be explained by decoding skills (D) alone. Only 9 percent of the variance could be explained
by listening comprehension (C) alone. By fourth grade, however, the measure of listening
comprehension had begun to account for more variance: the unique contribution of C rose to 21
percent, while the equivalent number for D fell. By eighth grade, fully 36 percent of the variance
in reading comprehension scores could be explained with reference to the children’s listening
comprehension ability. The unique contribution of D sank even further. In other words, while
reading comprehension depended on D and C at every stage, as the simple view would predict,
C explained more and more of the variation among students as time went by. What this tells us
is that, once the intricacies of decoding are mastered (and in English, this takes some time),
reading comprehension depends more and more heavily on language comprehension. Language
comprehension depends on background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural literacy.


~~**TWO MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT READING AND WRITING**~~


The Skills Strand teaches the mechanics of both reading and writing. It is based on the most
current research on reading and writing, but at the same time, it has been written in opposition to
some ideas that have been very influential in elementary education in recent decades. Two of those
ideas are:


Learning to read and write is natural.


Teacher Resources **197**


Learning to read and write is easy.


Both ideas have great emotional appeal. Unfortunately, both are wrong.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT NATURAL**~~


Many scholars have argued that spoken language is natural for human beings. The cognitive
scientist Stephen Pinker, for example, has argued that human beings have a language instinct,
meaning that humans are born with an innate capacity for learning language. This may turn out to
be true. It is at least a plausible theory since historians, linguists, and anthropologists have never
found a human culture that does not use language. When something is universal, it may turn out to
be natural.


What is true of oral language is not necessarily true of written language. In fact, with written
language, we know we are dealing with something that is not natural or innate because we know
when and where writing was invented, and we know that, even today, not all languages have a
system of writing. There are still hundreds of languages in the world that are spoken but not
written or read.


Ten thousand years ago this was the norm rather than an exception. At that time, there were
probably no human beings who knew how to read or write. According to the linguist Florian
Coulmas, the idea of writing down language was probably developed independently by three
ancient cultures: the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, and the Chinese. Each used a slightly different
system, and the mechanisms these pioneers developed for recording speech then spread from one
culture to another, evolving as they went. If these initial inventors had not come up with schemes
for writing down speech, we might all be illiterate today.


Writing is many things. It is an art that can be taught and learned. It is an invention—one of the
greatest inventions in human history. It is a technology enabling us to do things we could not do
without it—a technology every bit as exciting and amazing as airplane flight or electric power. But
it is not natural. The same is true of reading, which is simply the process of unpacking, or decoding,
what somebody else has written.


Reading and writing are both highly artificial. We tend to recoil at that word. We have internalized
the idea that natural is good and artificial is bad. Therefore, we think reading must be natural. In
fact, as the reading researcher Philip Gough has written, reading is a highly unnatural act.


The first step toward good reading and writing instruction is to understand that reading and
writing are artificial—but not necessarily in a bad sense. We need to remind ourselves that the
word artificial derives from the word art. To say reading and writing are forms of art that had to be
invented and need to be taught to children does not make reading and writing any less wonderful
or important. On the contrary, it makes these things more wonderful and precious, and it also
emphasizes the importance of your job as a teacher. There is no job more important than teaching
young children the magnificent, valuable, and highly unnatural arts of reading and writing.


**198** Foundational Skills 8


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT EASY**~~


The second idea noted earlier, that learning to read and write is easy, is also mistaken. Reading and
writing are complex behaviors, and they are more complex in English than in many other languages
because English has a complicated spelling system. In Spanish, for example, the relationships
between letters and sounds are mostly one-to-one, meaning each sound is usually written with
one spelling, and each spelling unit is usually pronounced one way. This is not the case in English.
To read and write English with a high degree of accuracy, there is quite a lot that students need to
learn.


As a way of demonstrating the complexity involved in learning to read and write in English, suppose
we attempted to list all the discrete bits of information a person needs to know to be able to read
and write in English. As a starting point, we might begin with the 26 letters and argue that these
are the 26 things one really needs to learn to read and write English. However, for each letter, one
eventually needs to learn not only the letter shape but also the letter name (to be able to read
abbreviations and initials). So that is 52 bits of information.


That is a good start, but we must not stop there. In English, all letters can be written in uppercase
and lowercase forms, and the uppercase forms are not always the same as the lowercase forms.
Compare ‘B’ to ‘b,’ ‘D’ to ‘d,’ ‘H’ to ‘h,’ ‘R’ to ‘r,’ and ‘Q’ to ‘q.’ At least 16 uppercase letters have a
slightly different form than the matching lowercase letters. So, we must raise our estimate of the
complexity of the English writing system to 68 bits of information.


We are not done yet. Students must also know the 44 sounds these letters stand for. That raises
our estimate of the complexity to 112.


If there was a simple one-to-one relationship between letters and sounds, that might be a good
estimate of the code’s complexity. Unfortunately, the relationships between sounds and letters in
English are quite complicated. The 44 sounds of English can be spelled many ways. In our work on
this program, we have identified 150 spellings that are frequent enough to be worth teaching in the
early grades. That boosts our estimate of the complexity of the code to 262.


In addition, students need to learn to track from left to right, blend sounds into words (when
reading), and segment words into sounds (when writing and spelling). They need to learn a handful
of symbols used in writing, including the period, comma, exclamation point, question mark,
quotation mark, and apostrophe. That raises our estimate of code complexity to about 270 bits of
information.


We could boost the estimate even higher by adding Tricky Words and unusual spellings or by
pointing out that many letters in English can be pronounced in different ways. We could also point
out that reading a word like thin requires students to group the first two letters and attach them to
one sound, and reading a word like cake requires students to scan ahead, see the ‘e,’ and realize it
controls the pronunciation of the ‘a’ earlier.


Even without these additions, the English writing system is quite complicated.

~~**THE PROBLEM WITH WHOLE LANGUAGE**~~


On a conservative estimate, there are 270 bits of knowledge a person needs to be able to read and
write English. It is unwise to ask students to tackle all this complexity at once and hope they will
figure it out. Yet that is precisely what is done in so-called “Whole Language” approaches. Whole
Language instruction is based on the assumption that learning to read is natural and not difficult,
so reading skills can be allowed to develop gradually, without much explicit instruction. Lots of
students in Whole Language classrooms do manage to figure out the English writing system, but
many others do not. Whole Language ideas have tremendous emotional appeal, but the Whole
Language approach is actually a recipe for leaving many children behind. It is an especially risky
strategy for disadvantaged children.


A much better strategy is to introduce the English spelling code explicitly, beginning with the
easiest, least ambiguous, and most frequently used parts of the code and then adding complexity
gradually. That is the central strategy on which this program is based.


The strategy adopted in this program is the same strategy that successful coaches use when
teaching children, a sport such as tennis. The successful coach does not ask students to learn
“Whole Tennis” and soak up the necessary skills all at once by trying to hit all different kinds of
shots the first day on the court. Instead, the successful coach teaches the student to hit a forehand
ground stroke and provides lots of practice hitting forehands. Then the coach moves on to teach
a backhand ground stroke, then a forehand volley, then a backhand volley, then a serve, then an
overhead smash, then a drop shot, etc. With each element taught, the student becomes a stronger
and more complete player. In the same way, this program begins by teaching the most common
and least ambiguous spellings for sounds and then moves on to introduce the more complex parts
of the writing system.


~~**KEY ASPECTS OF THE SKILLS STRAND**~~


Some key aspects of the Skills Strand are listed below.


   - This program teaches reading and writing in tandem, since they are inverse processes. English
writing involves making pictures of sounds; reading involves translating those pictures back into
sounds and blending the sounds to make words.


   - This program includes explicit, systematic phonics instruction in which students are taught target
skills needed to independently decode and encode words This program explicitly teaches lettersound correspondences as opposed to leaving students to figure these out on their own or deduce
them by analyzing familiar whole words (as in some forms of “analytic” phonics).


   - This program focuses on sounds, or phonemes, as the primary organizing principle of the program,
rather than letters.


   - This program focuses consistently on the phoneme, or single sound, and not on larger units.
Students learn to read words that contain onsets, rimes, and consonant clusters, but they learn to
view and process these larger units as combinations of smaller phoneme-level units. Rimes like _–ick_
and initial clusters like _st–_ are not taught as units but as combinations.


**200** Foundational Skills 8


  - This program uses a synthetic phonics approach that teaches students to read by blending through
the whole word; it does not teach multiple cueing strategies, use of pictures as a primary resource in
decoding, or part-word guessing.


  - This program begins by teaching the most common or least ambiguous spelling for a sound (the
basic code spelling); later it teaches spelling alternatives for sounds that can be spelled several
different ways. Thus, the system is kept simple at first, and complexity is added bit by bit as
students gain confidence and automatize their reading and writing skills.


  - This program includes words, phrases, and stories for students to read and activity pages for
them to complete that allow for focused, distributed practice working with the letter-sound
correspondences they have been taught.


  - This program does not require students to read words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have learned. In other words, all words students are asked to read as
part of the program are decodable, either because they are composed entirely of letter-sound
correspondences students have been taught or because they are Tricky Words that have been
taught. This means students have a chance to begin reading words and stories that are completely
decodable before tackling words and stories that are full of spelling alternatives.


  - This program does not require students to write words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have been taught. In other words, students are only asked to write words that
can be spelled (at least plausibly if not always correctly) using the code knowledge they have been
taught.


  - This program carefully controls the introduction of Tricky Words and words with ambiguous or rare
spellings, preferring to have students learn to read and write with regular words that can be blended
and spelled by the letter-sound correspondences taught.


  - High-frequency words compiled from a research-based list for Grade 3 are also taught as they
appear in the Unit Readers. They are revisited frequently to build automaticity and fluency.


  - This program avoids letter names because what is important for reading is not the letter name but
the sound value the letter stands for. To read the word cat, it is essential to know /k/ /a/ /t/, not
“see aay tee.”


~~**THE BASIC AND ADVANCED CODE**~~


The program teaches the highly complex letter-sound correspondences of the English language
in an explicit and systematic manner in Kindergarten–Grade 3. Students are taught how the 26
letters (or graphemes) of the alphabet are used in various combinations to represent 44 sounds
(or phonemes). There are approximately 150 different spellings for these sounds.


Students are first taught the basic code for each of the 44 phonemes. The basic code spelling for
a sound is usually the most common, or the least ambiguous, spelling for a sound. By learning
these letter-sound correspondences first, students experience a high degree of predictability, and
therefore success, in decoding words with these spellings.


Teacher Resources **201**


Basic code spellings may be single letters, such as these spellings and sounds: ‘a’ > /a/, ‘e’ > /e/,
‘b’ > /b/, and ‘m’ > /m/. Basic code spellings may also include digraphs, or two letters to represent
a sound, such as _ee_   - /ee/, _oy_   - /oi/, _ou_   - /ow/, _sh_   - /sh/, and _th_   - /th/. Other basic code
spellings include separated digraphs, such as _a_e_   - /ae/, and _o_e_   - /oe/.


The advanced code consists of all other spelling alternatives (over 100) that may be used to spell
the 44 phonemes in English. Examples of alternative spellings include ‘mm’ > /m/, _ss_   - /s/,
‘c’ > /s/, _g_   - /j/, _ay_   - /ae/, and _ey_   - /ee/. Some of these spelling alternatives occur relatively
frequently in the English language, while others are quite rare. See the charts provided for the
basic and advanced code.

~~**TRICKY WORDS**~~


The term _Tricky Word_ is used in this program to refer to a word that does not “play by the rules” of
spelling and/or pronunciation. Examples of Tricky Words include _one_, _said_, _of_, _were_, and _have_ .


You can describe the trickiness of a Tricky Word like said in two ways. If you think about it from
a spelling point of view, you might say that the word said is tricky because the sound /e/ is not
spelled with an ‘e,’ as you might expect it would be. On the other hand, if you think about it from a
reading point of view, you might say the word is tricky because the letters _ai_ are not pronounced
/ae/, as you might expect they would be. Either way you look at it, _said_ is a Tricky Word.


But notice that the word is not completely irregular, either. The first letter and the last letter are
pronounced exactly as you would expect. It is only the second and third letters, representing the
vowel sound, that are not sounded as you would expect. Or, if you prefer to look at things from the
speller’s perspective, you might say the first and last sound are spelled just as you would expect; it
is only the middle sound—the vowel sound—that is spelled irregularly. This is the case with many
Tricky Words: most of them have a regular part (or parts) and then a tricky part. You will find that
the tricky part involves the vowel sound and its spelling.


Teacher Resources **203**


When you are asked to teach a Tricky Word, the guidelines in the Teacher Guide will generally
prompt you to begin by reminding students that not all words play by the rules and words that do
not play by the rules are called Tricky Words. Next, the Teacher Guide generally suggests you write
the Tricky Word on the board. You may wish to ask a student to read the word as he or she thinks it
might be sounded (i.e., to blend according to the normal procedures). Alternatively, you can read
Tricky Word that way yourself. Then you can point out how the word is pronounced. Once you have
established the actual pronunciation, you can point out and/or discuss what is regular and what
is irregular about the word. Most Tricky Words have at least some parts pronounced exactly the
way you would expect. For example, as noted above, the first and last letter in _said_ are pronounced
just as one would expect. After discussing the regular parts, you should then draw attention to the
tricky part (or parts) of the word, pointing out letters not pronounced as one might expect they
would be (e.g., the _ai_ in _said_ ). This is the part of the word that students just must remember.


By drawing attention to the regular as well as the irregular parts of the word, you teach students
that Tricky Words are only partial exceptions to the normal rules of reading and writing. (They are
not so much irregular as they are a little less regular than most words.) There are some parts of
the word spelled as you would expect and pronounced as expected. Then there are some others
that are not. There is a subtle but important difference between teaching Tricky Words this way and
teaching them as single entities that must be memorized as wholes, as if every part of the word
were unpredictable.


Note that some Tricky Words are part of spelling patterns. For example, the words _he_, _she_, _we_,
_be_, and _me_ are taught as Tricky Words in earlier grades because it is hard to write stories without
them. However, once the ‘e’ spelling alternative for /ee/ is taught, these Tricky Words can be seen
as part of a larger pattern that includes words like _replay_ and _prefix_ . Other Tricky Words, such as
_one_ and _of_, remain tricky even when most of the spelling alternatives have been taught. By Grade
3, students have been taught the majority of the code knowledge needed to decode most words in
the English language. As such, there is less of an emphasis on Tricky Words in the Grade 3 program.


~~**SIGHT WORDS AND TRICKY WORDS**~~


One of the most common terms in the world of reading instruction is _sight word_ . Unfortunately, this
is also a rather ambiguous and potentially confusing term. Educators use the term sight word in
two different senses. For some people, sight words are high-frequency words that students need to
encounter frequently and learn to decode rapidly and effortlessly. Other people use the term sight
word in a more restrictive sense, to refer to words that cannot be sounded out using letter-sound
correspondences and may need to be taught as exceptions.


In this program, we define these terms as follows:


   - A Tricky Word is a word that does not play by the rules. It is a word containing at least one part that
cannot be read correctly via blending or cannot be spelled correctly using the code knowledge
taught so far.


   - A sight word is a high-frequency word that we want students to see many, many times and learn to
read quickly and eventually learn to recognize rapidly.


**204** Foundational Skills 8


The main difference here is that a Tricky Word always contains some irregular element, whereas a
sight word might or might not. The Venn diagram below shows the relationship between these two
categories, as understood within this program.

|Tricky Words|Overlap|Sight Words|
|---|---|---|
|<br>colonel, aisle, Aarol, ballet|of, to, once, one, was, who, said|in, it, at, on, if, then, this, did, and, with|



The words in the left circle are Tricky Words: each one contains at least one set of letters that is not
pronounced the way you would expect. Or, if you prefer to look at matters from a spelling point of
view, you could say each contains at least one sound that is not written as you would expect it to
be.


The words in the right circle are sight words: they are all high-frequency words that students
should see frequently and eventually learn to recognize rapidly.


The shaded area in the middle shows that there is considerable overlap between the two categories
(which is probably why the two senses of _sight word_ are regularly confused). Some words qualify
as sight words because they are used a lot and as Tricky Words because they are not pronounced
(or written) as you would expect. These are irregular words (and therefore hard to read and write,
at least first) and very common (and important for student success). They are candidates for
special instruction, and many of them are given special instruction in this program.


The area on the far left shows words that are tricky in the sense that they depart from the most
common spelling patterns. But these words do not qualify as sight words on most lists because
they are not especially common. Words of this sort are sprinkled throughout the language but do
not receive much attention because they are only used occasionally. Students can learn them as
the need arises in upper grades.


The area on the far right shows words that qualify as sight words because they are very common
and should be rapidly recognized but do not qualify as Tricky Words because they are completely
regular. All of them are pronounced and spelled exactly as you would expect. They can be sounded
out and set down on paper using basic letter-sound correspondences taught in Kindergarten.
Students need to see these words—and they will see most of them frequently in the materials—but
you probably do not need to give these words special attention, and you certainly should not ask
students to memorize them as wholes. Students can simply read them by sounding them out. After
sounding them out several times, they will begin to recognize them more rapidly. In other words, no
special teaching is required for these regular high-frequency words. All that is required is multiple
exposures, and students are likely to get multiple exposures since the words are so common.


~~**SIGHT WORDS**~~


The guidelines for teaching Tricky Words are outlined in the section above. As noted above, we use
the term sight word in this program to refer to high-frequency words that we want students to see
many, many times and learn to recognize rapidly.


Teacher Resources **205**


The program does place the initial emphasis on reading regular words. But that does not mean
high-frequency sight words are not being learned. In fact, as noted above, many sight words are
completely regular and become decodable as students learn letter-sound correspondences. This
means that the program is a very effective program for teaching sight words.


To illustrate this, consider one of the most widely used lists of sight words, Dr. Edward Fry’s
“Instant Word” list. Fry’s list is divided into groups of 100. For illustration purposes, we will focus
on the first three lists of 100 words, 300 words in all. These are words that Fry recommends be
mastered in the first several grades of school. We found more than half of the Fry Instant Words
become fully decodable in kindergarten, meaning they are either regular and can be sounded out
using the letter-sound correspondences taught, or they are Tricky Words explicitly taught in the
program.


**HIGH-FREQUENCY WORDS**


In addition to addressing Tricky Words and tricky spellings, this program emphasizes the reading
and spelling of high-frequency words carefully selected from word lists compiled by researchers
Edward William Dolch and Edward Fry. These lists are instrumental in aiding students, particularly
young learners, to become more proficient readers by focusing on words that frequently appear in
English reading materials.


Specifically for grade 3 students, the lists include 132 words, of which this program provides
explicit instruction for 98. These words are selected based on their prevalence across various unit
Readers, ensuring instruction is both relevant and practical. Instruction is integrated into lessons
at points where students will naturally encounter these words within the assigned sections of the
Readers.


The program encourages students to identify and recall previously taught high-frequency words
to reinforce learning, thereby gradually expanding their lexicon through repeated exposure. This
strategic approach ensures that students learn to recognize and use these essential words and
improve their reading fluency and comprehension.


The process for determining which high-frequency words to teach and the timing of their
introduction is structured and integral to the curriculum, designed to optimize comprehension and
retention. Each unit focuses on 8–12 high-frequency words. These words are carefully selected
based on their relevance as content words central to the unit’s Reader and their frequent usage
throughout the Reader. To facilitate learning, these words are introduced by sounding them out and
employing Spelling Cards, which aid in decoding.


As the unit progresses, the high-frequency words highlighted in the Reading section of each
lesson are consistently reviewed, ensuring recognition and understanding of these words both in
and out of context. To reinforce learning and maintain engagement, focused high-frequency word
decode/encode games found in the Reading section are incorporated every few days, strategically
reviewing one-third of the previously encountered words to reinforce retention.


**206** Foundational Skills 8


To further consolidate learning, a final high-frequency word game that reviews all the words
introduced in the unit is played at designated Pausing Points, ensuring multiple opportunities
to interact with and master these words. Additionally, fluency checkpoints are conducted to
monitor progress in automaticity and fluency, essential components of reading proficiency. This
comprehensive approach ensures that students are not only exposed to high-frequency words but
also engage with them in a variety of contexts, enhancing reading skills and confidence.

|Unit|High-Frequency Word Scope and Sequence|
|---|---|
|1|night, about, tree, story, thought, every, began, hard, important, river, small, near|
|2|talk, walk, head, eyes, book, being, run, drink, long, much, keep, group|

|10|eight, school, enough, show, watch, song, almost, list|



~~**CUSTOMIZING AND ADAPTING THE PROGRAM**~~


This is a highly structured and sequenced program. We are unapologetic about that, as we believe
the structure and sequence will be very helpful to students as they work to learn the English
spelling code. However, this is not a scripted program in which teachers are required to read
the manual and give one of a handful of approved responses. We expect—indeed, we hope—
teachers will tweak the phrasing and come up with ways to customize, personalize, and adapt the
instruction.


Our goal has been to put things in a logical order and provide all the guidance and support
necessary for a new teacher, or a teacher new to this kind of phonics instruction.


At the same time, we believe there is room for experienced and creative teachers to customize
and adapt the program. Indeed, some of the exercises included in this version of the program were
developed by teachers in our pilot programs!


Sometimes in the lessons, we give exact phrasing that we suggest you use; more often, however,
we give indirect phrasing and/or encourage you to explain something using your own words. You
should feel free to make changes to the phrasing. For example, you may prefer to speak of “a
picture of a sound” or a “spelling.” Later in the year, you may want to teach the term digraph, or
you may prefer to refer to the letters in a digraph as a “letter team” or as “buddy letters.” There are
many ways to customize the program and the language while preserving the basic instructional
principles and sequence of instruction.


Teacher Resources **207**


For the presentation of words, you may write on a chalkboard, a whiteboard, chart paper, an
overhead projector, a document camera, or the projection system of your choice. A projection
system works especially well for activity pages since it allows the teacher to model the task exactly
as the students will be completing it. You may use a pocket chart, a magnetic board with magnetic
letters, an overhead projector with letters cut from a transparency, or a smart board. Many
modifications of this sort can be made without adversely impacting the quality of the instruction.


You should also always feel free to add additional activities and activity pages that are consistent
with our philosophy of instruction. You should always feel free to respond to the teachable
moment, even if it leads you slightly off the path laid out in the Teacher Guide.


There are only a handful of things you should not do:


You should not skip a lesson in which new code knowledge is taught. If you do, students will lack
important code knowledge, untaught spellings will begin to appear in their word lists and on their
activity pages, and the lessons will start to make less sense to them.


For the same reasons, you should not reorder the lessons. The program relies heavily on
sequencing, and instruction will be confused and less effective if the lessons are reordered.


~~**SMALL-GROUP WORK**~~


Large parts of this program have been written for whole-group instruction, but the program can
be customized to allow for small-group instruction of various kinds. You will note that there are
Support and Challenge sidebars sprinkled throughout the lessons that will guide you in how to
differentiate instruction for your students, while still using the whole-class approach described in
the lessons.


Since some students will learn the new information right away while others will need more practice,
you may wish to do small-group work to follow up the initial introduction of code knowledge.
You will note that many lessons do include suggestions for small groups; you should feel free to
adapt to these and other lessons as they best meet the needs of your students. We have seen this
program taught very effectively in small groups and in workstations students visit on rotation.


~~**ADJUSTING THE SPEED OF INSTRUCTION**~~


This sequence will work for most children. However, all children are different, and all classrooms
are different. Some classrooms may need more time to master concepts than others. The program
has been designed so the pace of instruction can be adjusted as needed.


The most important thing for you to know is that you can pause at any point in the program.
If students are not learning the material, simply stop where you are and do additional work to
accelerate or reteach as needed. All lessons contain some materials you can use if you pause.


**208** Foundational Skills 8


In addition, at the end of each unit there is a “Pausing Point.” If the end-of-unit assessment or your
observations suggest some members of the class need additional time to master the concepts
taught in the unit, this is an especially good place to stop and provide additional practice and
review. The Teacher Guides include additional work at each Pausing Point. They will typically
provide enough for at least 2 days of additional work. The materials provided in the Pausing Point
can be used in various ways. Sometimes you may wish to have all students do the same activity
or activity page. At other times you may wish to work individually or in small groups with students
who are struggling with a particular concept.


To slow down instruction, you can pause either in the middle of a unit or at a Pausing Point. We do
not recommend that you attempt to speed up the sequence of instruction. The program lays out an
ambitious program of instruction.


The Grade 3 program of instruction should work well for a wide range of students. You should begin
with the assumption that the Grade 3 program is an appropriate option for all students in the class.


Inevitably, however, there will be differences in learning. Students learn at different rates. Some
students will pick up the material quickly; others will have more difficulty. There are many
strategies for dealing with this. In general, we encourage you to try to keep most of the class
together if it makes sense. It is much easier to teach one set of students at roughly the same level
than it is to teach two or three groups at very different levels.


If you find some students are lagging, you may still be able to keep the class together for the main
lessons but find extra time two to four times a week to work with those students who seem to need
extra practice.


If this is not sufficient, you may eventually need to regroup some students. As we note in Lessons
4–5 of this unit, it is especially important to administer the placement assessment to all students
at the start of the year. We strongly recommend that teachers then use an “across grade” approach
to grouping students. If there are two classrooms, these two teachers should look at all of the
Grade 3 students in both classrooms and consider regrouping students for Skills instruction only,
with one teacher taking the class of students who need review and more practice, while the other
teacher works with those students ready to move on to Grade 3 Skills instruction. It will likely be
worthwhile to reconvene at multiple times during the year to plan across the grade level, using
the end-of-unit assessments. In this way, students in need of acceleration can be moved to the
appropriate group, while students who are making progress can advance.

**Appendix C:**
#### Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words


Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught will enable students to read one
syllable word with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences is no
guarantee that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllabic words. To this
end, most students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk and read
parts of words—syllables—to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can
then be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated, and students are
expected to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, the program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the
easiest two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is
already a familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In
addition, each syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic
familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing_, _hunt·er_, _bust·ed_ ).
The dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain doubleletter spellings for consonants, in this program, the divider is typically placed after the doubleletter spelling rather than between the two consonants (e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers
that are familiar with other ways to chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is
done, however, because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single-spelling units
since kindergarten ( _nn_   - /n/, _mm_   - /m/, _tt_   - /t/, etc.). The program strives to be consistent in
representing these spellings in the way that the students have been taught to process them (e.g.,
as whole entities for a sound). (Ultimately, as students become more proficient at decoding and
chunking syllables through subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually
chunk and decode these words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding
these two-syllable words consisting of root words and suffixes relatively easy.


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable
words.


**216** Foundational Skills 8


To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


  - **Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound (e.g.,**
**/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/):** _let, pad, rod, tin, fun, pic·nic, un·til_


  - **Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /**
**ie/, /oe/, /ue/):** _cake, home, like, mule, Pete, mis·take, stam·pede_


  - **Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint, speak, proud, play, dis·may, be·low, coun·sel_


  - **R-Controlled Syllables:** _art, curb, girl, fort, clerk, tur·nip, ar·tist, fe·ver_


  - **Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /ie/,**
**/oe/, /ue/):** _go, me, hi, a·pron, fi·nal, com·pre·hend_


  - **Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple, puz·zle, raf·fle, ca·ble, ri·fle_


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


  - _Schwa Syllables:_ ben·e·fit, ap·pe·tite, a·bout, hos·pit·al, e·mo·tion


**Note:** The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately
because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


To decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these names. The names of the
syllable types are provided here only to establish a common vocabulary for teachers as they use
the materials. What is necessary, however, for students to become fluent readers of longer words in
increasingly complex text is that they be able to visually parse certain spelling patterns as syllable
chunks so they can quickly and easily decode each syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


  - When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.
_ad·mit_ _nap·kin_ _trum·pet_


  - For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed
after the double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is
because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units since kindergarten
( _nn_    - /n/, _mm_    - /m/, _tt_    - /t/, etc.).
_traff·ic_ _muff·in_ _happ·en_


Teacher Resources **217**


   - When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.
_mon·ster_ _con·tract_ _pil·grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read
the first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model
for students how to blend the two syllables aloud:


   - In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the magic
‘E’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


   - Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for closed
syllables:
_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


   - In Grades 2 and 3, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to
use a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying
each possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


   - When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:
_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_


**218** Foundational Skills 8


However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There
is no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be
flexible and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to
determine whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. To recognize
whether a word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has
heard before (i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent
an additional challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a
second language.


  - If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:

_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is straightforward.


  - When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings
in the words.
_ban · gle twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_


In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings
represent the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a
combination of stressed and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed
or weakly stressed, its vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that
linguists call a schwa. This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include


Teacher Resources **219**


‘a’, ‘e’, _al_, _il_, _el_, and _tion_ . Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite
challenging for many students.


   - Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the
schwa sound has a particular spelling:
_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is a schwa syllable, but it is identified separately
because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables
accordingly throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _tri·cycle_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness_ _help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten—Grade
3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.
