**Lesson 13: Review Suffix Rules** **Digital Component 13.1**

#### **Review Suffi x Rules**


**Double the fi nal consonant:** One-syllable words with a
short vowel sound and a single consonant ending change
to a double-letter spelling at the end when – _ing_ is added
(example: _run_ / _running_ ).


**Drop the silent ‘e’:** When a word ends in silent ‘e’ and you
add a vowel suffi x like   - _ed,_   - _er,_ and – _ing_, you drop the ‘e’
(example: _bake_ / _baking_ ).


**Change ‘y’ to ‘i’:** When a word ends with a consonant and
‘y’, we change the ‘y’ to ‘i’ before adding – _ed_ or – _er_ (example:
_reply_ / _replied_ ).
