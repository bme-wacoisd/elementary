# **Fluency Supplement**

Research demonstrates that fluency practice produces gains in reading
comprehension. The program’s fluency instruction includes modeled reading,
assisted reading (such as choral or paired reading), independent reading, along
with breadth of text encounters and extended deep reading of selected texts.
This multi-faceted approach ensures that students receive low-stakes practice
along with engaging, authentic fluency tasks, such as performances.

This fluency supplement was created to accompany the program’s Grade
3 materials. It consists of poetry, folklore, and fables. These additional text
selections provide opportunities for students to practice reading with fluency
and prosody (expression).

The fluency routine outlined below provides a structured approach that equips
students to read passages accurately and with expression, including phrasing
and intonation. As they gain accuracy and confidence, they will naturally
begin to read more quickly. However, it’s important not to pressure students
to race through the text or read with undue speed. In addition, it is not a
memorization drill—students should read the text as they act it out even if they
have memorized the words. The goal is to read smoothly, accurately, and with
prosody.

At the beginning of the week, you should make sufficient copies of the week’s
selection for each student. You should model reading the selection aloud to all
students. When time allows, have students spend time practicing reading the
passages aloud each day and encourage additional practice at home. During
classroom practice, you should circulate around the room and provide students
with corrective feedback. The expectation for all students should be that they
are prepared to read the selection fluently and with prosody by Friday.

The five-day fluency development routine below includes the following
components:

**Day 1:** Introduce the text and read it aloud several times, modeling different
tones or inflections, phrasing, and expression, and encouraging students to
reflect on each one. For example, if you read in a monotone, students should
realize that this is not a stellar reading; they may suggest better approaches,
such as reading in a happy tone, an excited tone, a nervous tone, or other tone
appropriate to the selected text. Discuss with students that text features, such
as punctuation, and sentence structure can help them know when to read
text with phrasing, intonation, and expression (prosody). After modeling, invite
students to read aloud sample sentences from the text.


_Grade 3_ | Fluency Supplement **1**


Students are encouraged to start reading the target text aloud at home. They
may use reading logs to record each session, if desired.

**Day 2:** Students practice reading the text chorally, with varying inflection or
tone, phrasing, intonation, expression, or other elements.

**Day 3:** Students practice both choral and paired readings, continuing to
develop tone, inflection, phrasing, intonation, and expression. Listen to
students practice reading and provide corrective feedback where necessary.

**Day 4:** Students continue practicing paired readings in preparation for the
following day’s performance. Circulate around the room and provide paired
students with corrective feedback where necessary.

**Day 5:** Student pairs perform their reading.

**Differentiation Options:** Students who are ready for a challenge may be
prepared to perform the text independently, while students who require
additional support may read the text chorally in groups rather than pairs.

If you choose to evaluate students’ performances, you may use the Fluency
Passage Performance Rubric to evaluate each performance.












|Fluency Passage Performance Rubric|Col2|Col3|Col4|
|---|---|---|---|
||**Advanced**|**Proficient**|**Basic**|
|Accuracy|Reading contains<br>no errors in<br>pronunciation.|Reading contains<br>minimal errors in<br>pronunciation.|Reading contains<br>numerous errors in<br>pronunciation.|
|Rate|Reading is<br>conversationally<br>paced or paced to<br>show appropriate<br>emphasis and<br>inflection.|Reading is uneven,<br>with interspersed<br>periods of speed and<br>sluggishness.|Reading is labored<br>and slow.|
|Expression<br>(Prosody)|Expression is strong<br>throughout the<br>reading. While the<br>tone and volume<br>may vary, they<br>do so in keeping<br>with the student’s<br>understanding of the<br>piece.|Reading generally<br>sounds like everyday<br>speech, with<br>possible lapses<br>into expressionless<br>speech.|Words are<br>pronounced,<br>but they are not<br>spoken in a manner<br>that indicates an<br>understanding of<br>their meaning.|



These selections may also be used to assess students’ performance in fluency
and expression (prosody). We recommend asking a student to read a passage
aloud for a set amount of time, such as one minute. During that time, the
student will read from their copy, while you use an additional copy of the text


_Grade 3_ | Fluency Supplement **2**


to mark any words the student misses during the allotted time and to record
student’s use of expression (prosody), including phrasing and intonation. At
the conclusion of the allotted time, calculate the words read correctly to get
an estimate of the student’s fluency rate. Provide the student with feedback
and work together to set achievable goals to support each student in reading
smoothly, accurately, and with prosody. This activity may be repeated
throughout the year with different texts in order to measure student progress
in fluency.


_Grade 3_ | Fluency Supplement **3**


**Dear Family Member,**


Throughout Grade 3, your student will be bringing home short text selections
on a weekly basis to practice reading. Your student should read the selection aloud
each night to help them become increasingly fluent and able to read without
hesitation. You or another family member may want to read the selection aloud
first to model reading with fluency and expression.


At the end of each week, your student may be called upon to practice reading
the selection aloud in class.


Repeated readings of text help build reading fluency, which includes automatic
word recognition, expression, accuracy, and speed. The goal of using these short
text selections is to help your student continue to strengthen their reading skills.

**1.** **“Winter Night”**


by Mary F. Butts


Blow, wind, blow!

Drift the flying snow!

Send it twirling, whirling overhead!

There’s a bedroom in a tree,

Where, snug as a snug can be,

The squirrel nests in his cozy bed.


Shriek, wind, shriek!

Make the branches creak!

Battle with the boughs till break of day!

In a snow cave warm and tight,

Through the icy winter night,

The rabbit sleeps the peaceful hours away.


Scold, wind, scold!

So bitter and so bold!

Shake the windows with your tap, tap, tap!

With half-shut, dreamy eyes

The drowsy baby lies,

Cuddled close in his mother’s lap.

**2.** **“The Horse”**


by F. Wyville Home


Oh a strange and curious thing is a horse,

Believe or not, as you choose.

For he takes it quite as a matter of course

That he goes to bed in his shoes.


And his shoes, which are iron and not soft leather,

Are nailed to his feet with pegs

And he falls asleep without minding the weather,

As he stands upright on his legs


And his hair doesn’t grow in the proper place

But out of his neck instead

And his ears are not at the side of his face,

But stand on the top of his head.

**3.** **“Foreign Lands”**


by Robert Louis Stevenson


Up into the cherry tree

Who should climb but little me?

I held the trunk with both my hands

And looked abroad on foreign lands.


I saw the next door garden lie,

Adorned with flowers, before my eye,

And many pleasant places more

That I had never seen before.


I saw the dimpling river pass

And be the sky’s blue looking-glass;

The dusty roads go up and down

With people tramping into town.


If I could find a higher tree

Farther and farther I should see,

To where the grown-up river slips

Into the sea among the ships,


To where the roads on either hand

Lead onward into fairy land,

Where all the children dine at five,

And all the playthings come alive.

**4.** **“To the Pacific Ocean”**


by Katherine Chandler


The party went down the Columbia River in canoes.

It was a hard trip.

It rained all the time.

Each day the men were wet to the skin.

They had to carry their goods around some rapids.

They could not be very cheerful.

One day it stopped raining for a little time.

The low clouds went away.

The party saw that the river was very wide.

They rowed on.

Then they saw the great ocean lying in the sun.

They became very happy.

They cheered and laughed and sang.

They rowed on very fast.

Captain Lewis wrote in his book:

“Ocean in view! O! the joy! We are in VIEW of the Ocean, this
great Pacific Ocean, which we have been so long anxious
to see. The noise made by the waves breaking on the rocky
shores may be heard distinctly.”

**5.** **“The Philosopher and the Acorn”**


by Marmaduke Park


A philosopher, proud of his wit and his reason,

Sat him under an oak in a hot summer season.

On the oak grew an acorn or two, it is said:

On the ground grew a pumpkin as big as his head.

Thought the sage, “What’s the reason this oak is so strong

A few acorns to bear that are scarce an inch long;

While this poor feeble plant has a weight to sustain,

Which had much better hang on the tree, it is plain?”

But just at the time the philosopher spoke

An acorn dropp’d down on his head from the oak;

Then, said he, who just now thought _his_ plan was so clever,

“I am glad that _this_ was not a pumpkin, however.”


Word Count: 124 words


**Moral:**

The sage would no doubt have looked grievously dull,

Had a pumpkin descended with force on his skull.

Of his folly then let us in future beware,

And believe that _such_ matters _are best as they are_ :

Leave the manners and customs of oak trees alone,

Of acorns, and pumpkins—and look to our own.

**6.** **“How the Leaves Came Down”**


by Susan Coolidge


“I’ll tell you how the leaves came down,”

The great Tree to his children said,

“You’re getting sleepy, Yellow and Brown,

Yes, very sleepy, little Red;

It is quite time you went to bed.”


“Ah!” begged each silly, pouting leaf,

“Let us a little longer stay;

Dear Father Tree, behold our grief,

‘Tis such a very pleasant day

We do not want to go away.”


So, for just one more merry day

To the great Tree the leaflets clung,

Frolicked and danced, and had their way,

Upon the autumn breezes swung,

Whispering all their sports among,


“Perhaps the great Tree will forget

And let us stay until the spring

If we all beg and coax and fret.”

But the great Tree did no such thing;

He smiled to hear their whispering.

“Come, children all, to bed,” he cried;

And ere the leaves could urge their prayer

He shook his head, and far and wide,

Fluttering and rustling everywhere,

Down sped the leaflets through the air.


I saw them; on the ground they lay,

Golden and red, a huddled swarm,

Waiting till one from far away,

White bedclothes heaped upon her arm,

Should come to wrap them safe and warm.


The great bare Tree looked down and smiled.

“Good-night, dear little leaves,” he said;

And from below each sleepy child

Replied “Good-night,” and murmured,

“It is _so_ nice to go to bed!”

**7.** **“Why the Bear Has a Short Tail”**


by Florence Holbrook


One cold morning when the fox was coming up the road
with some fish, he met the bear.


“Good-morning, Mr. Fox,” said the bear.


“Good-morning, Mr. Bear,” said the fox. “The morning is
brighter because I have met you.”


“Those are very good fish, Mr. Fox,” said the bear. “I have
not eaten such fish for many a day. Where do you find them?”


“I have been fishing, Mr. Bear,” answered the fox.


“If I could catch such fish as those, I should like to go
fishing, but I do not know how to fish.”


“It would be very easy for you to learn, Mr. Bear,” said the
fox. “You are so big and strong that you can do anything.”


“Will you teach me, Mr. Fox?” asked the bear.


“I would not tell everybody, but you are such a good friend
that I will teach you. Come to this pond, and I will show you
how to fish through the ice.”


So the fox and the bear went to the frozen pond, and the
fox showed the bear how to make a hole in the ice.


“That is easy for you,” said the fox, “but many an animal
could not have made that hole. Now comes the secret. You
must put your tail down into the water and keep it there. That
is not easy, and not every animal could do it, for the water
is very cold; but you are a learned animal, Mr. Bear, and you
know that the secret of catching fish is to keep your tail in the
water a long time. Then when you pull it up, you will pull with it
as many fish as I have.”

The bear put his tail down into the water, and the fox went
away. The sun rose high in the heavens, and still the bear sat
with his tail through the hole in the ice. Sunset came, but still
the bear sat with his tail through the hole in the ice, for he
thought, “When an animal is really learned, he will not fear a
little cold.”


It began to be dark, and the bear said, “Now I will pull the
fish out of the water. How good they will be!” He pulled and
pulled, but not a fish came out. Worse than that, not all of his
tail came out, for the end of it was frozen fast to the ice.


He went slowly down the road, growling angrily, “I wish I
could find that fox;” but the cunning fox was curled up in his
warm nest, and whenever he thought of the bear he laughed.
