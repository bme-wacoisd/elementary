**Introduction**


Our bodies are amazing machines. But
they only stay amazing with some help. Our
bodies need good food, regular exercise, and
lots of rest. There are many ways to keep
your body in tip-top shape. So, lace up your
sneakers, and grab some water. Get ready to
be the best you!

**Chapter**
### **[Sleep Routine]**
# **1**

Think about a toy electric race car. If you play
with it for a long time, the batteries run down,
and you need to recharge it. You also get tired
and need to rest to recharge your body. Sleep is
like giving your body a battery boost. You feel
rested and ready to play and learn again when
you wake up after sleeping.


When we sleep, our bodies actually grow
stronger. As you’re dreaming at night, your body
is doing something cool. There’s a small part of
your brain called the **pituitary gland** . It creates
something called growth hormone, which plays
a key role in your body’s growth. It helps you get
taller and makes your muscles strong. While you
are resting, this gland is working.



2


But there’s more that happens when you
recharge during sleep at night!


With all the running around we do, our
bodies need some fixing. Activities during
the day can make our cells run down. Sleep
helps those run-down cells, too. During deep




These proteins fix our **cells**, repairing them
and helping them grow. They are like tiny
workers in our bodies, fixing everything while we
dream. When you sleep, you’re not just resting;



4


Do you remember what you learned at school
today? Or a new game your friend showed you?
Sleep helps you remember those things better.
Your brain has billions of nerve cells called
**neurons** . These tiny parts talk to each other.
When you learn, your neurons connect, and
sleep helps strengthen these connections. During
very deep sleep, you dream, but your brain is also
busy thinking about the day. It is like updating
and **organizing** files on a computer. Sleep makes
your memory better.


Getting enough sleep can make it easier for
your brain to remember things. When you miss
sleep, your brain can’t sort and save what you
learned that day. But with good sleep, your brain
can store all the cool things you learned. So,
when you sleep, your brain works to make you
smarter!

**Get Into a Routine**


What you do before bedtime can really affect
how you feel in the morning and the whole next
day.


Athletes have routines they follow to get
better at their sport. Following a **routine** means
doing things in the same order every time.


If you make a bedtime routine **consistent**,
you can get better sleep. Your body and mind
need time to shift from ‘day mode’ to ‘night
mode.’ Doing the same things in the same order
every night signals to your body that it is time to
sleep.

7


Going to sleep and waking up at the same
time, even on weekends is a routine that helps
your body know when it’s bedtime. Before bed,
experts suggest turning off TVs, phones, and
computers for at least an hour. Their blue light
can make your brain too awake. Experts also say
not to eat a big meal right before bed. When a
person eats, their belly stays busy for a while,
so for their whole body to rest, it’s better to eat
earlier. Things with caffeine, like some sodas, can
keep people awake, so not drinking them before
bedtime can help with better sleep too.


Right before bed, doing quiet things help slow
your body down. Running around is fun, but it
increases **cortisol** in your body. Cortisol is your
body’s stress hormone. Quiet activities could
include playing quiet games, reading a book,
or illustrating a picture. These activities lower
cortisol and stress to help a body to relax.



8


9


When it gets dark, our bodies make a
hormone called **melatonin** to help us sleep.
A dark room helps your body make more
melatonin. Some people decorate their sleeping
space with light-blocking curtains. A sleeping



10


A clean room can help you relax. If each item
in your room has its own spot, you can find
what you need more easily. Consider doing your
homework outside of your bed. This might train




Loud sounds can wake us up or stop us from
sleeping. Some people use earplugs or a machine
that makes soothing sounds. Even a fan’s sound
can help a person sleep. A quiet place seems to
produce the best sleep.


What if you still can’t sleep after trying these
tips? It’s okay! Sometimes, we just need more
time to relax. Sleep experts suggest that you
inhale and exhale slowly by thinking about
inflating a balloon with your breath and then
letting the air out slowly.



12


Another suggestion is to close your eyes and
think of a nice place, like the beach or woods.
Picture waves or singing birds. Think about how
the sun’s warmth or the cool shade feels. This can
help you breathe easily and feel sleepy. Soon, you
will be ready to escape to dreamland. What other
tricks can you use to help you sleep better?

**Chapter**
### **[Exercise and Water]**
# **2**

Playing and being active is really good for you.
Doctors **advise** that you exercise every day.


**Pumping Power**


Your heart is a strong muscle inside your
chest that beats day and night. It sends blood
everywhere in your body. Your heart beats about
100,000 times a day! That’s a lot of hard work!
The sound your heart makes, “lub-DUB, lubDUB,” is the sound of its **valves** opening and
closing. Even when you’re resting, your heart is
working hard. But when you run around and
play, it beats faster. It’s like your heart is a little
drummer that plays quicker when you move,
sending blood and air to every part of you.



14


Your heart gets good at its job when you
stay active, just like a drummer who’s great at
keeping the beat. What are your favorite ways
to be active?




**Clean Streets**


Think of your body like a big city. In this
city, there are lots of roads. These roads are called
**arteries** . They let blood travel all through you.
When you’re active, your heart makes the blood
rush down these roads. Being active is important
because it keeps the roads open and clean. It’s
like having a street cleaner that clears away any
trash. The arteries get **clogged** if you don’t get up
and move. So when you exercise, you’re helping
keep the roads for your blood open and trafficfree.


Blood also has little soldiers in it called white
blood cells. They look for germs that don’t
belong, like bad bacteria and viruses. When
you’re active, your heart pumps more, and these
soldiers can zoom around faster to find germs.
They can also talk to each other better, like using
walkie-talkies to call for help.



16


This makes it easier for them to unite to stop
the germs. Movement excites your blood soldiers




**Good to Go**


Think of a super-cool car. Every car needs
**fuel** to go. Your body is the same. Your body
uses food instead of gas for energy. There are
different types of fuel for cars and many types
of food for your body. Healthy foods like fruits,
vegetables, whole grains, and protein are the
best fuel for humans. When you eat, your body
works hard to break the food into tiny parts.
This is called digestion. When food is digested,
the smallest bits are called nutrients.


One special nutrient is glucose, a kind of
sugar. It gives your body energy, like a speed
boost for a car! Your body’s tiny parts, called
cells, use glucose and oxygen to make energy.
This is called **cellular respiration**, which is like
your cells breathing!



18


If you eat more food than you need
right then, your body saves some for later. It
stores extra energy in special parts called fat
cells. Your body uses this saved energy when it is
needed.


This energy helps you do everything from
running and jumping to thinking and breathing!
Every time you move and even when you’re

energy from food. What

healthy foods?.


Next time you’re
munching on a meal,

actions going on inside
you. You’re not just
eating; you’re fueling up!




**Mighty Muscles**


Every time you move, you are using your
muscles. The harder you work them, the stronger
they get. But how?


Your muscles are made of many tiny fibers
like a bunch of small ropes all bundled together.


Your brain sends muscles to these fibers to make
them contract and relax. This puts stress on your
muscles. It might sound scary, but it’s actually a
good thing!



20


Here’s why: Your body is super smart.
It sends in special cells to help them. The cells
add more material, promoting muscle growth.
This repair makes the muscle fibers thicker and
stronger than before. It’s like when you build
with clay. If you add more and more layers, the
shape becomes bigger.




Every time you exercise, you’re
challenging your muscles and bones. Your body’s
cells build up your muscles and bones even more,
making you stronger over time.


do their job right!



22


Just like you wouldn’t
dump trash on trees, you
wouldn’t want to fill your
lungs with dirty stuff.
Smoke, pollution, and dust
can harm our lungs. These

to breathe. Spending time
outside, especially in green
places like parks or forests, gives your lungs a
treat because the air there is clean and fresh, full
of good oxygen your lungs love.


Exercise is like a workout for your lungs! You
breathe faster and deeper when you run, skip, or
play. Your body needs more oxygen when you are
active, and this deeper breathing helps keep your
lungs strong and healthy. It’s like giving your
lung balloons a good **stretch** !



23


**Happy Tummy**


Imagine your digestive system is a wild
waterslide at an amusement park. The fun
starts at the top. When you eat, you put food
in your mouth; then it travels down your
throat. This is like a person zooming down
a waterslide. The food goes through many
twists and turns to get to the bottom. When
you exercise, it’s like getting an extra push at
the top of the slide. Working out helps your
stomach and intestines move the food along
faster.


Exercise increases blood flow in your body.
Your body sends more blood to your muscles
when you’re active. It also sends more blood
to your stomach and intestines to help them
work better. Did you know your stomach and
intestines have muscles? Yep! And when you
move, those muscles move, too.



24


They squeeze and relax, pushing the food
along and helping break it down. It’s like how
you’d squish and squash clay to shape it.




Your intestines hold more than food.
There are friendly little bugs called **microbes**
or **bacteria** that help you digest your food.
Most of these bacteria are friendly. They
help break down the food you can’t digest on
your own. When you exercise, it helps these
bacteria do their job. Movement contributes
to a better home in your intestines. The
bacteria help you get the most out of the food
you eat. This means a short walk after a meal
is helpful to the work your body is doing
with food. Exercise can also help increase the
number of good bacteria in your gut.



26


**27**


28


29


Water also helps clean up any mess the cells
produce. After the nutrients are delivered, there’s
some leftover stuff called waste. Water helps carry
this waste away like a garbage truck. If we don’t
drink enough water, it’s like the garbage truck
refuses to work. This may cause us to feel sleepy,
have headaches, or forget things.


We sweat to cool down when we run around,
especially on a sunny day. This sweat is our
body’s way of saying, “Whew! It’s hot!” There are
tunnels from the glands to our skin, that send
sweat to our skin when we are too hot. The air
dries the sweat, which is mostly water, on our
skin. It’s like getting out of a shower or pool and
feeling the cool air. The sweat takes heat away as
it dries, but it also takes away the water. When
we’re sweaty, there is no substitute for drinking
water. Sweating uses up some of our water, so we
must drink more to stay cool and **hydrated** .



30


Even when we’re just chilling or watching TV,
our body still needs water. Sometimes, when our
tummy rumbles, and we think we’re hungry, we
might be thirsty! So, the next time you want a
cookie or chips, try drinking water first. Maybe
your body is just asking for a cool drink!




**Chapter**
### **Personal Hygiene**
# **3**


**hygiene**, which means keeping ourselves
clean.


**Scrub a Dub Dub!**



32


33


When we’re feeling the heat or getting active,
our bodies sweat. This sweat can mix with the
oil, becoming a sticky trap for even more dirt
and germs.


When we wash, it’s like giving our body a
fresh start. Soap is useful for removing the oils
from around the germs so the water can wash the
germs away. We scrub away all the dirt and germs
on our skin, which means fewer germs to make
us sick, helping our skin stay clean and happy.


Our scalp, the skin under our hair, also makes
oil. This oil keeps our hair shiny and healthy, but
dirt from the playground or dust from our homes
can stick to the oil in our hair. Washing your hair
regularly keeps your scalp and hair clean.


Our feet work hard! They carry us everywhere:
to school, the park, and back home. But they also
get sweaty, especially when we’re running around



34


or if our shoes are tight. Sweat mixed with the
oils of our skin creates a damp place germs
absolutely love! After washing, dry your feet well,
even between the toes because germs love hiding
there.




**Keep It Clean**


Every day, our clothes grab tiny bugs called
germs from things like dust or sneezes. These
germs then hop onto our skin. Clean clothes help
protect our skin and body from germs that might
make us sick.


After playing all day, our shoes might feel a
bit damp inside. Wet shoes are like a fun park for
germs and can make our feet smelly. But if our
shoes dry properly, our feet stay happy and fresh.
Giving shoes time to dry before wearing them
again helps to keep germs away from your feet.

**Great Times to Wash Your Hands:**


- Before eating: Anything on our hands might
end up in our mouth when we eat. Clean
hands mean clean food!


- After using the bathroom: Plenty of soap and
water will remove the germs.


- After playing outside: Even if you can’t see it,
there could be dirt and germs on your hands
and body.


- After touching pets: Our furry friends are
great but can carry tiny germs on their fur or
skin.


- After coughing or sneezing: Tiny water
droplets spray out when we cough or sneeze,
and these droplets can carry germs. It’s like
splashing in a puddle.



40


41


Water works best when combined with soap.
You need soap to ensure the germs are really
gone. Sing “Happy Birthday” twice while you
scrub your hands with soap and water. After
washing, use a clean cloth or air dryer to dry
your hands fully. That way, you will know your
hands are truly clean and free of germs.


We use an umbrella to keep the rain off us
when it rains, and tissues are like umbrellas that
protect us from germs. In the same way, a tissue
can trap germ-filled water **droplets** when we
sneeze or blow our noses. After using the tissue,
remember to toss it in the trash and then wash
your hands. Hopefully, by doing this, germs
won’t spread to your friends or family.



42


Our nose is a warm **cave** for germs. Germs
love to hang out there, so it’s best to keep fingers
out. Otherwise, you might move the germs
from your nose to other parts of your body or to




**Chapter**
### **[Dental Hygiene]**
# **4**

Mouths are busy places. We use them to
eat yummy meals, sip on drinks, chat with
friends, and even sing our favorite songs. Our
teeth become shiny and look like little white
stars when we brush them.


**Mouth Matters**


Brushing after eating is important! Tiny
food bits and icky bacteria stick around if
we forget to brush. It’s like how bugs gather
around a bright light. These bacteria love the
leftover food and make a sticky thing called
**plaque** . Plaque can make **acid** if we don’t
clean it off, which creates tiny holes in our
teeth. And it turns into hard **tartar** if we wait
too long. Tartar can make our gums (the pink
stuff holding our teeth) look red and puffy.



44


45


46


Brushing keeps our breath fresh. Leftover food
and bacteria from our meals can give breath a
bad odor. Using a toothbrush helps by making
our teeth super clean. But the brush can’t always
reach the tiny spaces between our teeth. That’s
where floss comes in! Floss is a tiny tool that
slides between teeth and grabs food bits and
bacteria.


Need more inspiration to brush? Keeping our
mouths clean doesn’t just make our teeth happy.
The rest of our body might get upset if we don’t
brush well. Germs from our mouths can get into
our blood and create problems for our **organs**,
like our hearts. Taking care of our teeth keeps our
whole body smiling!



47


**Tip Top Teeth**


Here is some guidance for a good
toothbrushing routine. Dentists suggest that you
use toothpaste and a soft toothbrush, and brush
in circles to cover all parts of your teeth. Focus
on more than the teeth closest to the front of
your mouth, and be sure to get to the teeth in
the back. People who brush in the morning clean
off bacteria that grew overnight. Brushing again
later removes the food you ate during the day.
What other tips have you learned for good teeth
brushing?


**Flossing** removes food and plaque between
teeth, so dentists suggest that people floss daily.
Mouthwash can make your breath smell good
and kill germs, but you still need to brush and
floss. Remember that bacteria on your tongue
can cause bad breath.

move teeth to the right place so they

will look great when they come off!

### **Mind-Body** **Connection**
# **5**

Just like bodies go through many changes,
our minds change often as well. Sometimes, we
feel happy, excited, or calm. Other times, we
might feel sad, angry, or scared. Our feelings
can affect the health of our bodies. Just as we
sleep and exercise to keep our bodies healthy,
we can do things to keep our minds healthy,
too.


**Feel and Heal**


Think about playing a video game and
being surprised by an enemy. You would be on
high alert, right? In the same way, when you
face problems, your body gets ready to respond.
This is called the “fight or flight” response.



52


**Stress** causes the production of **chemicals** that
get you ready for action.


One of these chemicals is **adrenaline** .




Luckily, there are many ways to control
stress and reduce adrenaline. It can clear your
mind to play, exercise, or even just take a walk.
Happy and relaxed feelings are more noticeable
after playing. That’s because exercising helps
your brain release tiny happy helpers called



54


55


Everyone’s brain works in its own **fascinating**
way. Some of our friends might find it hard to
focus. Some might have a lot of worries. Some
might get sad often. All feelings are okay. It’s
normal to have many different feelings, even in
one day! But it’s important to talk about it if a
feeling like sadness doesn’t go away. You can share
your worries with a trusted adult, like a family
member, if the feelings make things hard for you.
Sharing feelings is courageous.


**Friendly Faces**


Good friends are great for our mind and body
because friends can help us feel happy and less
alone. They may listen when we are sad, and they
may make us laugh. Being with friends can make
bad times easier and fun times even better. This
can lead to lower stress levels, and some experts
believe that less stress makes you less likely to get
sick. So being with friends is not just a good time,
but also a great way to stay healthy.



56


57


Being part of a group or having close
friends can give us a sense of belonging.
Friends can also help us feel good about
ourselves. We may learn from friends
how to share, solve problems, and
understand others’ feelings. Positive
friendships can be encouraging to us.
Good friends may keep us from making
bad choices because they want the best
for us. They can make us want to try
new things. Engaging in active play with

great for our body. Friends can **motivate**
each other to do well in school or study
together. Having good friends is like
having a team always there for you.

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully leveled
in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.

The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many spellings
can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to make early
reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of the available
spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out as part of their
phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been deliberately
introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if they are
assigned at the proper time.

As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.


TRICKY WORDS:


bacteria, batteries, blood, building, cells, earlier, early, energy, exercise, flossing, fruit, germ,
heart, healthy, hygiene, intestine, muscle, pressure, proteins, routine, should, soldier, sugar,
tissues


**Code Knowledge added gradually in the unit for this Reader:**


  - Decoding multisyllabic words with VCe syllables


  - Decoding words with suffixes that change the base word by dropping the final E
