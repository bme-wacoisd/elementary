**Grade 2 Foundational Skills 2|**
###### Introduction


~~**UNIT OVERVIEW**~~


Unit 2 builds on the previous unit and introduces several new skills and concepts that students will
revisit or build upon in later units. This unit begins with a continuation of their learning about the
VCV syllable division pattern, shifting from the VC/V pattern and closed syllables explored in Unit
1 to the V/CV pattern and open syllables. The focus of the unit then transitions to using context to
determine the meaning of multiple-meaning words, followed by a deeper look at multisyllabic words
with open syllables. The unit ends with students’ first interaction with affixes in Grade 3 as they
identify the meaning and use of words with the _–ed_ and _–ing_ suffixes. As students work with the
unit’s Reader, these skills are underscored and solidified through word choices in the text, allowing
them to see and engage with these foundational skills in action.


Students will first work on encoding and decoding multisyllabic words that follow the V/CV
pattern and thus have open syllables. Breaking down words into syllables and understanding
syllable patterns is particularly helpful to early readers and language learners as they learn how to
decode, spell, and pronounce words and simultaneously build their language awareness, reading
comprehension, and fluency.


Students will next examine multiple–meaning words and how to use the context in which they are
used to understand which meaning is correct. Learning how to understand these words’ meanings
in context is a critical thinking skill that not only enhances reading comprehension but also builds
competency toward vocabulary development and language proficiency that will benefit them as
developing readers, writers, and speakers.


Finally, students are introduced to affixes with the _–ed_ and _–ing_ suffixes, building on earlier work in
the unit with the V/CV pattern and with decoding and encoding multisyllabic words. Students learn
introductory rules about adding suffixes that will benefit them as they delve deeper into many more
suffixes in later units.


~~**TRICKY SPELLINGS**~~


As new spellings are introduced, some complexity is added to the reading process. Some of the
spelling units that students have to process are ambiguous in the sense that they can stand for
more than one sound. These ambiguous spellings are called “tricky spellings.” This concept was
previewed by students in previous years; it is not an introductory concept. In Unit 2, instruction
focuses on spelling words with the _–ed_ and _–ing_ affixes.


Introduction
**1**


**2**



**Tricky Words and High-Frequency Words**


Tricky Words are introduced in this unit on an as-needed basis in the context of the different
selections included in the Reader. Tricky Words should be taught in the lessons before the reading
selections are assigned. When introducing Tricky Words, be sure to draw attention to the parts that
are read (and spelled) just as students would expect based on what they have learned so far, and
also point out the tricky parts of each word.


The Tricky Words taught in this unit are:


 - Lesson 1 - _engine, curious_


 - Lesson 6 - _dangerous_


 - Lesson 11 - _leopard, camouflage_


 - Lesson 12 - _territorial_


 - Lesson 13 - _favorite, successful_


In addition to addressing Tricky Words and tricky spellings, this program emphasizes the reading
and spelling of high-frequency words, carefully selected from word lists compiled by researchers
Edward William Dolch and Edward Fry. The selection of these words was based on their prevalence
within the unit Reader, and instruction is integrated into lessons at points where students will
naturally encounter these words within the assigned sections of the Readers.


The curriculum includes a structured approach for teaching high-frequency words, starting with
the introduction of 8–12 keywords at the beginning of each unit, selected for their relevance and
frequency in the unit’s text. Words are introduced using phonetic sounding and Spelling Cards for
decoding. Throughout the unit, these words are reviewed in various contexts, including through
decode/encode games and fluency checkpoints to assess automaticity and fluency. This ensures
that students engage with the words multiple times, enhancing their reading skills and confidence.


The high-frequency words taught in this unit are:


 - Lesson 1 - _talk_, _walk_, _head_


 - Lesson 2 - _eyes_, _book_


 - Lesson 3 - _being_, _run_


 - Lesson 6 - _drink_, _long_


 - Lesson 9 - _much_


 - Lesson 12 - _group_


Foundational Skills 2


~~**READER: A TALK WITH ANIMALS**~~


The Unit 2 Reader tells the story of Annie, who, along with her family, embarks on a safari to explore
the vast savanna. Along the way, Annie learns about the terrain and the creatures who live there
through the animals she meets—and talks to! She first encounters an ostrich named Olivia, who
tells Annie about these huge birds’ unique traits and the challenges of being a baby ostrich. The
family then encounters a riverbank teeming with animals, where the guide warns of the hidden
danger—crocodiles—and where Annie’s alertness saves some zebras from a crocodile. Annie learns
about crocodile habits, their swimming abilities, and the tension between crocodiles and other
animals as Cooper the crocodile shares insights into his species. As they move into the forest, Annie
encounters Lenny, a leopard with unique spots, who shares leopard behaviors with the girl, including
their camouflage techniques, use of their powerful hind legs for hunting, and the importance
of climbing trees for safety. Back home, Annie reflects on the unforgettable safari experiences
and shares her adventure with her friends through a slideshow that highlights the beauty and
excitement of the safari and the lessons she learned about wildlife, survival, and the importance of
understanding and respecting nature.


Each time students encounter a new section of text in the Reader, the lesson includes new
vocabulary words and/or phrases to accompany the section of text. There are lessons in which
students reread sections of the Reader, for the purpose of building fluency. These lessons do not
introduce new vocabulary or have a vocabulary chart.


~~**UNIT 2 ASSESSMENT**~~


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


Throughout this unit, formative assessments are clearly marked for monitoring individual student
performance and progress in key skills. Quick Checks for Understanding to evaluate classroom
performance as a whole are also designated in each lesson. Fluency practice takes place regularly
throughout the unit.


Records for recording student performance in an Anecdotal Reading Record, Grade 3 Foundational
Skills Record, Grade 3 Fluency Record, and Grade 3 End-of-Year Summary are included in the
Teacher Resources.


**Student Performance Assessment**


In Lessons 14 and 15, you will be prompted to administer a multipart end-of-unit assessment. In the
first part, you will work one-on-one with students to complete the Fluency Assessment. Students
will engage in a review activity while awaiting their turn for the assessment. The Reading and
Spelling portions of the assessment take place during the first 20 minutes of the second lesson.
Once students have completed the assessment, they will have time for Self-Sustained Reading.
Use time in this lesson to finish working with students who still need to complete the Fluency
Assessment in the previous lesson.


Introduction
**3**


**4**



The target words in each of these assessments include the vowel sound/
spellings taught in this unit; distractors have been intentionally selected
because they represent frequent sound/spelling confusions. Student
performance on these assessments is a good indicator of whether students
have mastered the new sound/spellings.


~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice Unit 2 skills
can be found in the Pausing Point section included after the last lesson. It
is strongly recommended that you pause for one day and provide targeted
review for individuals or groups of students in any areas in which they had
significant gaps on the end-of-unit assessment.


All students will benefit from an additional opportunity to reread pages
from the decodable student Readers. It is particularly important to make
use of targeted activities if the end-of unit assessment and/or formative
assessments indicate that any students are experiencing difficulties with
specific skills taught during the unit. In the Pausing Point, activity pages are
provided. You may wish to reproduce the handwriting pages and use them for
morning or seat work.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available in the
program’s online materials. This component has been designed to
complement the unit. It consists of poetry, folklore, and fables. These
additional text selections provide opportunities for students to practice
reading with fluency and prosody (expression). See the Unit 1 introduction or
directions in the Fluency Supplement for further guidance.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


In the Teacher Resources section at the end of this Teacher Guide, you will
find forms and charts which may be useful, including the following:

~~**REVIEW VC/V AND INTRODUCE THE V/CV SYLLABLE PATTERN (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students to recall what type of syllable they focused on in the previous
unit (closed syllables; single short vowel between (closed in) two consonant
or consonant digraphs).


  - Explain that in this unit, students will be adding to their understanding of
syllables by looking at open syllables: syllables with a long vowel sound. In
these words, the syllables are divided differently.


  - Write the words _cabin_ and _tiger_ on the board in cursive, modeling proper
letter formation. Invite students to write the words in cursive in the air with
their index finger.


  - Prompt students to turn to a partner and identify the vowels in each word.
Invite students to share their answers. Underline the vowels (‘a’ and ‘i’ in
_cabin_ ; ‘i’ and ‘e’ in _tiger_ ).


  - Invite a student to the board. Direct the student to point to the letter ‘b’ in
_cabin_ and the letter ‘g’ in _tiger_ .


**TEKS 3.1.B** Follow, restate, and give oral instruction that involves a series of related sequences of actions; **TEKS 3.2.A.iv**

Foundational Skills 2


- Ask: What do you notice about the location of the consonants in the words?
_(Both ‘b’ and ‘g’ are located between two vowels.)_


- Label each word with the VCV syllable pattern. Have students spell each word
aloud, stomping their feet for the vowels (Vs) and tapping the top of their
desk for the consonants (Cs) that represent the VCV pattern in each word.


- Display VCV Syllable Patterns (Digital Component 1.1 or TR 1.1), and read the
rules and examples aloud to students to clarify the differences between the
VC/V and V/CV syllable division patterns.


- Have students repeat the VCV Syllable Pattern rules to a turn and talk
partner in their own words.


- Explain that these rules can also be used when figuring out how to pronounce
a word.


- Model this routine: Clap the syllables to _cabin_ aloud.


- Write the word cabin on the board and mark the syllables you hear by using a
slash mark. It should look something like this: cab/in.


- Examine the syllables for patterns you recognize: cab = CVC (the medial vowel
should make a short a sound); in = VC (the vowel makes the short i sound)


- Say the word, keeping the syllable rules in mind. Cab-in. (Cab-in is VC/V
closed syllable word)


- Guided practice with the same routine but different words for students to
practice with: Say the word _tiger_ .


- Prompt students to repeat and clap the syllables.


- Write the word _tiger_ on the board.


- Have a student come up and mark the word by dividing into syllables ti/ger.
Read the word. Ti-ger (Ti-ger is a V/CV open syllable word)


- Display Digital Component 1.2 and have students open to Activity Page 1.1.
Focus students’ attention on the top section, questions 1 and 2.


- For additional guided practice, direct students to work with a partner and use
the same process they just practiced with the words _savanna_ and _revealed_ .


- Circulate and monitor, providing corrective feedback such as, “Don’t forget to
use the vowels and consonants to help break the word into syllables.”

 - Explain that they will listen as you say each word once and then listen again
and write the word on the line. Direct students to write each word in cursive.


   - Recite the words _visited_ and _refocusing_ .

   - Circulate and monitor students’ proper cursive letter formation. Provide
feedback and assistance as students encode multisyllabic words
accurately. Provide immediate and corrective feedback such as, “Check
that your loops and tails are formed smoothly and connect to the next
letter.”


   - Direct students to label the VCV pattern and independently mark the
appropriate syllable division.


   - Focus students on question 5. Dictate the words _lemon_ and _taken_ . Direct
students to use the words _lemon_ and _taken_ in an original sentence.


   - Remind them to write neatly in cursive, leaving space between words.

   - Direct students to label the VCV pattern and mark the appropriate syllable
division for _lemon_ and _taken_ independently.


 - Write the word _pilot_ on the board. Explain that this word is in today’s chapter
and follows the V/CV syllable division pattern. Model for students how to
decode this word.


   - Points to consider while decoding: The word has two syllables.


 - Pronounce the word with the long vowel sound and the short vowel sound for
the initial vowel ‘i’ to determine which pronunciation sounds like a known word.

- Display this lesson’s vocabulary words: _savanna_, _revealed_ and _spyglass_ .


- Ask students to speak coherently and share what they know about these
words with a partner. Define unknown words.


- Ask students, based on these vocabulary words, what do they predict this
text will be about?


- Explain that _A Talk with Animals_ contains many high-frequency words. These
are common words, so they will come across them often as they read, in both
the Reader and in many different texts. Explain that learning to recognize
these words and how to spell them will improve their overall reading and
writing fluency.


- Display this lesson’s three high-frequency words: _talk_, _walk_, and _head_ .


- Focus students on the word _talk_ in the title of the Reader. Circle the ‘a,’ and
point out that it comes before the letter ‘l’. Remind students that when ‘a’
comes right before ‘l’ within a word, the ‘a’ makes the /aw/ sound. Say the
sound /t/ /aw/ aloud while running your fingers below the letters _ta_ .


Foundational Skills 2


  - Underline the letters _lk_ . Remind them that they may have learned that _lk_ is
a final blend; both ‘l’ and ‘k’ make their own sounds, but when next to each
other they blend together. Say the sound /l/ /k/ aloud while running your
fingers below the letters _lk_ .


  - Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves: /t/ /aw/ /k/. For additional
support, display the Spelling Cards for each sound.


  - Focus students on the word _walk_ . Point out that _walk_ follows the same
pattern as _talk_ .


  - Focus students on the word _head_ . Underline the vowel team _ea_ . Remind
students that with some exceptions, the vowel team _ea_ can make different
sounds: /ee/ as in _beach_ or /e/ as in _bread_ .


  - Remind students that most English words play by the rules, meaning they are
pronounced and spelled as we would expect. There are a few words that do
not play by the rules, including some very common and important ones.


  - Ask: What do we call words that do not play by the rules? _(Tricky Words)_ Why
are they called Tricky Words? _(Because they are not pronounced and spelled_
_as expected)._


  - Display the Tricky Words _engine_ and _curious_ .


  - Point out which parts of each word are not regular and will either be taught
later or simply must be remembered.

    - Tricky Word: _engine_ (explain that the split digraph i_e is pronounced /ĭ/)

    - Tricky Word: _curious_ (explain that the letter ‘i’ is pronounced /ē/)


  - Direct students to turn to his or her partner, assign one word to each partner,
and have each use their assigned word in a sentence.


  - Focus students the first section of Chapter 1, starting on page 1.


  - Explain that readers can warm up for reading just as athletes warm up before
playing a sport. Display the following sentences adapted from the Reader:


    - The pilot waved.

    - Annie stopped.

    - The ride had been scary.

    - She heard every sound.

    - Annie put her hand over her ears.

- Explain to students that they will read some short sentences as a warm-up
for reading longer, more complex sentences


- Direct students to hold their hand in front of their mouth, cupping it to direct
the sound back to themselves. Instruct them to read each sentence aloud
three times to themselves, practicing their intonation (the rise and fall of
their voice) to improve fluency each time.


- Refocus the class. Chorally read the first two paragraphs of the Reader on
page 1, Point out that these paragraphs contained many of the phrases from
the warmup sentences.


- Direct students to read the next two paragraphs on page 2 aloud into their
hands, Chorally read the two paragraphs as a class.


- Move students into small groups. Direct them to take turns reading each
paragraph aloud to their group. Read pages 3–7. Encourage them to use the
strategies of choosing phrases from the text to use as warmups or reading
into their hand as needed.


- Review the definition together and ask students to share their understanding
of the word. Call on a few students to share their thinking.


- Conduct a brief discussion about the different words and phrases in the
chart.


- Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension and students’ ability to
use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or multiple-meaning
words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant questions to clarify
any information from the text or prompts. Remind students to speak at
an appropriate rate and volume while maintaining eye contact. Example
prompts include:


1. **Inferential.** What do Annie’s thoughts and actions at the beginning of the
story show about how she felt about the plane ride? _(She thought it was_
_scary; she shook her head, she put her hands over her ears, she was glad to_
_be back on the ground.)_


2. **Inferential.** Based on what you have read so far, what can you infer about
Annie? _(she is nervous about flying, she is excited about the trip, she is_
_looking forward to seeing animals)_


3. **Literal.** What words from the text show that Annie feels small next to the
ostrich? _(Her mouth dropped open as she saw one of the birds; she felt like a_
_tiny rodent next to a huge human.)_


4. **Evaluative.** What is the most likely reason Annie is amused by the birds?
_(They have a big body, covered in feathers, and they are very large.)_

Foundational Skills 2


  - Ask students, based on these vocabulary words, what do they predict this
text will be about?


  - Explain that students will examine two new high-frequency words. Remind
them that these are common words that they will come across often as they
read and write.


  - Display this lesson’s high-frequency words: _eyes_ and _book_ .


  - Focus on the word _eyes_ . Point out that this is a plural noun and that the
singular is _eye_ . This is an irregular word; it is not written as it sounds, so we
need to use our memory to remember its spelling.


  - Provide students with whiteboards and dry erase markers, and have them
write the word twice while saying e-y-e in unison. Explain that repeatedly
practicing with reading and writing a word is one way we learn to quickly
recognize that word.


  - Direct students to erase their whiteboards. Write the word _eyes_ twice while
spelling it aloud by memory.


  - Focus on the word _book_ . Underline the vowel team oo. Remind students that the
vowel team oo can make different sounds: /oo/ as in look or /ōō/ as in soon.


  - Blend the sounds aloud for each possible pronunciation as students listen,
running your fingers underneath the letters each time: /b/ /oo/ /k/, /b/ /
ōō/ /k/. For additional support, display the Spelling Cards for each sound.
Confirm that the correct pronunciation is /b/ /oo/ /k/.


  - Write the word _moment_ on the board. Explain that this word is in today’s
chapter and contains the V/CV syllable division pattern. Model for students
how to decode this word.


  - Focus the class on the next section of Chapter 1, starting on page 7.


  - Direct students to scan this section of the text and notice the punctuation.
Explain that punctuation marks give clues about how a text should be read.
Clarify that when a sentence ends with a question mark, their voices should
go up to indicate that they are asking a question. When a sentence ends in an
exclamation mark, they should read the sentence with strong emotion. When
a sentence ends in a period, their voice should go down at the end.


  - Read aloud each of the following sentences from the Reader with expression,
and direct students to echo you:


    - “I am sorry for saying you look funny, but I have never seen a bird like you.”

    - “Will you talk with me so I can learn more about you?”

first person on the team to read it. Remind teams to communicate politely
with all other students while participating in the Baseball Syllable activity.


   - If the word is read correctly, draw a line from home plate to first base,
signifying a “hit.” This player should go to the back of his team’s line while
the next player comes forward to read the next card. If the second player
reads the word correctly, draw a line from first to second base.


   - Play continues in this way, so that each time a player reads a word
correctly, you draw a line to the next base. If the fourth player reads the
word correctly, draw a line from third base to home plate and mark “1
run” for this team.


   - Play continues for the members of this team so long as no words are
misread. When a word is misread, the next team takes its turn at bat.


   - As in the actual game of baseball, any players “left on base” when a word
is misread do not count or add to the score.

expression.


- Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension and for students’ ability
to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or multiple-meaning
words. Example prompts include:


1. **Literal.** What key details in the text support the idea that being a baby
ostrich is difficult? _(Baby ostriches have to peck their way out of their shell._
_Adult ostriches have to pre-chew a baby’s food. They need protection from_
_predators.)_

**Primary Focus:** Students will collaborate to read words that follow a VCV syllable
division pattern. ~~**[TEKS 3.1.D; TEKS 3.2.A.iv]**~~


~~**PRACTICE WITH PATTERN SEARCH (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Prompt students to discuss with a turn and talk partner: Why is it important
that we learn how to divide multisyllabic words into syllables? (it helps us
break apart unknown words, we can look closely at the vowel to determine
the sound it will make, etc.). What can you tell us about the V/CV and VC/V
division patterns? (this pattern tells us where to divide the syllable when a
consonant is between vowels based on the pronunciation of the first vowel)


  - Provide a sentence stem: The syllable division patterns we have learned
are . . .


  - Organize students into collaborative small groups.


  - Ensure each student has a sheet of lined paper and a large sticky note.


  - Explain to students that their group will be assigned a specific excerpt of
Chapter 1 of _A Talk with Animals_ to reread. Assign each small group Excerpt 1
(pages 1–3) or Excerpt 2 (pages 4–7).


    - Excerpt 1: Starting with “The pilot waved goodbye . . .” and ending with “. .

  - Tell students they will continue practicing syllabication of multisyllabic
words. When words are divided into syllables, it improves reading fluency and
accuracy. Understanding syllables can also help with learning to spell words
correctly.


  - Write the word _volcano_ on the board in cursive, modeling the proper letter
formation. Encourage students to use their index finger to write _volcano_ in
the air.


  - Ask: “How many syllables are in the word _volcano_ ?” “ How do you know the
number of syllables?”


  - Invite students to hold up the number of fingers that represent the number of
syllables in the word. Confirm that students should have three fingers in the air.


  - Provide a sentence frame to support students’ response: There are ___

syllables in the word ___. I know this because _____. (There are three
syllables in the word _volcano_ . I know this because there are three vowel
sounds in _volcano_, and every syllable has to have a vowel sound.)


  - Explain that multisyllabic words may have different syllable types within
the word. Model identifying the VCCV and VCV syllable division patterns to
separate _volcano_ into three syllables.


  - Focus on the first syllable.


  - Prompt students to turn to a partner and discuss: Is _vol_ an open or closed
syllable? How do you know? _(Closed because the syllable ends with a_
_consonant.)_

 - Model an action to represent a closed syllable: Clasp your hands together like
you are trying to flatten something between your palms. Prompt students to
mimic the action.


 - Focus on the second syllable.


 - Prompt students to turn to a partner and discuss: Is _ca_ an open or closed
syllable? How do you know? _(Open because the syllable ends with a vowel.)_


 - Model an action to represent an open syllable: Open your hands and hold
them apart like you are grasping an invisible soccer ball.


 - Focus on the third syllable.


 - Prompt students to turn to a partner and discuss: Is _no_ an open or closed
syllable? How do you know? _(Open because the syllable ends with a vowel.)_


 - Model the open hands action that represents an open syllable.


 - Remind students that the vowel sound in a closed syllable is short and the
vowel sound in an open syllable is long. Reiterate to students that identifying
the V/CV syllable pattern helps in determining if the syllable is an open
syllable.


 - Circle the open syllables in the word _volcano_ .


 - Write the word “relation”. Have students examine the syllables for the
patterns they recognize by isolating the vowel in each of the syllables. _re_ = CV
the vowel makes a long e sound; _la_ = the vowel makes the long a sound; _tion_
(suffix showing action)


 - Read the word, keeping the syllable rules in mind. Re-la-tion


 - Note: _relation_ contains a suffix which is an excellent place to start when
dividing a word into syllables as a suffix is its own syllable.

paragraph?” _(_ Curious _is used to describe what Annie is thinking and how she_
_would like to learn more.)_


  - Prompt students to turn and talk: “What words or phrases from the
paragraph help you understand the meaning of _curious_ ?” _(“did not know_
_much,” “had many questions,” “wanted to learn more”)_


  - Invite students to chorally read the second paragraph aloud.


  - Prompt students to turn and talk: “How is the word _curious_ used in this
paragraph?” _(Curious is describing the noise in the air and means strange, or_
_something you are not used to.)_

Provide students with
a simple sentence and
challenge them to think of
different ways of saying it
that change its meaning,
such as, “ _I_ didn’t say
you took my _cookie_ .” By
emphasizing different
words, the implication of

  - Tell students that today’s reading will focus on fluency. Remind students that
fluency refers to rate (appropriate pace), accuracy (reading words correctly),
and prosody (using phrasing and intonation to convey meaning).


  - Explain to students that they will reread a portion of Chapter 2 of the Reader
_A Talk with Animals_, “Cooper the Crocodile,” starting on page 20.


  - Inform students that today they will work on phrasing by scooping words
together in a sentence to make meaningful phrases instead of just reading
word by word.


  - Read the passage aloud and model disfluent reading, reading word by word,
with no meaningful phrasing.


  - Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share: “Did my reading sound fluent? Why or
why not?” _(When you read the words, it sounded sort of choppy. The words_
_did not connect like full thoughts or sentences. It was hard to know when one_
_thought ended and another one started.)_


  - Invite students to visualize a big shovel or a pelican scooping up fish in the
water. Explain that strong readers “scoop” phrases in a sentence, joining
them together in a way that conveys more meaning.


  - Display with the sentence: “Annie saw animals look around, move to the
water’s edge, drink from the river, and race off.”


  - Read aloud the sentence, pausing slightly after each comma. Draw an
imaginary scoop shape underneath each of these phrases.

Foundational Skills 2


- Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share: “Why might I have chosen these
specific phrases to scoop?” _(Each phrase describes one action. The words go_
_together to convey a single idea.)_


- Provide a non-example by rereading the sentence, scooping other groups of
words, such as, “Annie saw animals,” “look around move to,” “the water’s edge
drink,” “from the river and race off.”


- Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share: “How does the meaning of the
sentence change when scooping the words this way?” _(It’s harder to_
_understand. It’s not clear who is doing which actions in the sentence.)_


- Point out that the commas in this sentence are particularly helpful for
indicating where to pause and scoop phrases. Clarify that it won’t always be
obvious and there are usually multiple ways that a sentence could be read.


- Display the sentence: “She was concerned they did not drink enough water.”


- Invite students to share ideas for phrases that could be scooped together.
_(“She was concerned,” “they did not drink enough water.”)_


- Point out that there is no one right answer; the goal is to make sure that the
meaning is clear and, when reading aloud, that the reading is fluent.


- Today, students will follow these Partner Reading routines.


1. Open Reader


2. Partner Up.


3. Take turns reading paragraphs


4. After reading, provide feedback to your partner about reading smoothly

and scooping phrases. Use the stems provided such as, “I like how you

read that sentence with no mistakes and scooped that phrase in the

middle.”


- Have students repeat these steps back to you and then have them start the
Partner Reading routine.


- Pair students with intentional reading partners.


- Direct reading partners to draw scoops under phrases (with their finger and
an imaginary scoop or with pencils) in the first paragraph of the passage
together.


- Listen in on conversations listening for students’ ability to read in phrases

~~**REVIEW MULTISYLLABIC WORDS WITH OPEN SYLLABLES (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask: “Why is it important to break unknown words into syllables?” Suggest
the sentence starter: _It is important to break words I do not know into_
_syllables because_ . . . _(it can help me to figure out how to read and write the_
_word correctly)_


 - Write the word _phonemic_ on the board in cursive, modeling the proper letter
formation. Encourage students to use their index finger to write _phonemic_ in
the air.


 - Ask: “How many syllables are in the word _phonemic_ ?” _(three)_ “How do you
know the number of syllables?” _(Clapped out the syllables, three vowel sounds)_


 - Have students Turn and Talk to discuss the answers to the questions.
Invite students to hold up the number of fingers that represent the number
of syllables in the word. Provide a sentence frame to support students’
response: There are ___ syllables in the word ___. I know this because _____.
_(There are three syllables in the word phonemic. I know this because there are_
_three vowel sounds, and each must have a vowel sound.)_


 - Identify the VCV syllable division patterns to separate _phonemic_ into three
syllables.


 - Focus on the first syllable.


 - Ask students to turn to a turn and talk partner to answer the prompt: Is _pho_
an open or closed syllable? How do you know? _(Open because the syllable_
_ends with a vowel and makes the long vowel sound.)_


 - Encourage students to use the open hands action that represents an open
syllable.


 - Focus on the second syllable.


 - Ask students to turn to a turn and talk partner to answer the prompt: Is _ne_
an open or closed syllable? How do you know? _(Open because the syllable_
_ends with a vowel and makes the long vowel sound.)_


 - Encourage students to use the action for an open syllable.


 - Focus on the third syllable.


 - Ask: Is _mic_ an open or closed syllable? How do you know? _(Closed because_
_the vowel is closed in by consonants.)_


 - Encourage students to complete the clasped hands action that represents a
closed syllable.


Foundational Skills 2


 - Guide students through the same steps for VCV syllable division patterns
with the word _identify_, asking students to identify the syllable division
patterns and the open syllables. Encourage students to use the new actions
as they determine open syllables and closed syllables in the word _identify_ .


~~**PRACTICE WITH SPEAK AND SPELL (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students open to Activity Page 8.1 and follow the directions.


 - Review the Speak and Spell Activity.


 - Instruct students to listen as you say each word.


 - Say aloud the first word for students to hear: _radiant_


 - Repeat the word _radiant_ . Orally stretch the sounds.


 - Note: _Radiant_ may be an unfamiliar word for students. To provide context you
may mention that it means shining brightly or giving off a lot of light.


 - Instruct students to say the word aloud and clap the syllables as they say it.


 - Demonstrate how to move the word parts to their appropriate syllable boxes
on the activity page.


 - Circle the open syllables. Then, write the full word in the last column.


 - Remind students that they will do the same with each word they hear, writing
its syllables in cursive on their copies of Activity Page 8.1.


 - Repeat the process with each other word: _ingredient_, _momentum_, _component_
and _information_ .


 - Direct students to the blank lines on Activity Page 8.1. Explain that they will
listen as you say a word once and then listen again and write the word in
cursive: _humility_ and _conversation_ .


 - Note: To provide context you may mention that _humility_ means being modest
and not thinking that you are better or more important than others, and
_conversation_ means talking with someone, sharing ideas, and listening to
what others have to say during a discussion.


 - After writing the word, students divide the syllables and circle the open syllables.


 - For number 7, read the sentence to students and then repeat. Direct the
students to write the sentence neatly in cursive on the line:


   - His mom loves hazelnut candy.


 - Ask them to identify the multisyllabic word with an open syllable ( _hazelnut_ )
and mark the word by dividing the syllables and circling the open syllable.

**situation, n.,** the state of what is going on, or circumstances
Example: During recess, the situation changed when it started to rain, so we
had to go inside.


**lunge, v.,** to make a powerful forward movement, especially take hold of
something
Example: Our dog lunges toward his dinner bowl when he’s hungry.


 - Conduct a brief discussion about the meanings of the different words in the
chart. For example, show the words and ask students what prior knowledge
they may have about these words and where they might have seen them. The
multiple meanings of the words lunge, depending, behavior, and situation will
be explored in depth during the reading of the story. Briefly explain them as
you preview the vocabulary chart.


 - Model how to use the Glossary in the Reader to discover the pronunciation
and definition of words in bold. Review the definition together and ask
students to share their understanding of the word. Call on a few students to
share their thoughts.

- Explain that students will examine another high-frequency word.


- Display this lesson’s high-frequency word: _much_ .


- Circle the ‘ch’ at the end of the word. Remind students that they have learned
that the basic code spelling for /ch/ is usually _ch_ ; however, sometimes it is
spelled _tch_ .


- Remind students that if the final /ch/ sound comes after a short vowel
sound, it is usually spelled _tch_, like in _matchstick_ or _unhitch_ . Remind students
that if the final /ch/ sound comes after a long vowel sound, it is usually
spelled _ch_, like in _teacher_ or _encroaching_ .


Foundational Skills 2


- Point out the vowel sound /u/ in _much_ . _Much_ is an exception to these rules,
as the ‘u’ makes the /u/ sound and this word ends with a _ch_ instead of the
expected _tch_ .


- Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word _themselves_ : /m/ /u/ /ch/. For additional
support, display the Spelling Cards for each sound.


- Invite students to turn to a partner and use the word in a sentence.


- Display the following words from this lesson’s section of the Reader:
_depending_, _behavior_ and _situation_ .


- Pause to use the Glossary in the Reader to discover the pronunciation and
definition of: _lunge, depending, behavior,_ and _situation_ .


- Direct students to hold their hand in front of their mouth, cupping it to
bounce the sound back to themselves, and read each word aloud.


- Ask for volunteers to demonstrate and decode these words: de/pend/ing
_(de)_ ; be/hav/ior _(be)_ ; sit/u/a/tion _(‘u’, ‘a)_ .


- Guide the class in continuing to read Chapter 2, pages 33–36.


- Move students into four groups. Point out that this section contains eight
paragraphs. Each group will chorally read aloud two paragraphs. Assign the
two paragraphs to each group.


- Begin reading, pointing to each group to indicate when they should begin
chorally reading.


- Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension and for students’ ability
to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or multiple-meaning
words. Example prompts include:


1. **Inferential.** What does the word _modify_ mean on page 34? _(_ Modify _means_
_to change something based on what’s happening around you)_ What words
or phrases help you understand the meaning of the word _modify_ ? _(change,_
_depending on the situation, and wait)_


2. **Inferential.** On page 33 and 34, what key idea do you learn about
crocodiles? _(can still hunt completely under water, depend on element of_
_surprise to catch prey, use the advantage of hiding in the water to hunt)_


3. **Inferential.** What does the crocodile’s conversation with Annie on page
34 reveal about him? _(he asked Annie questions, so he is interested in what_
_she has to say; the text also says that he was eager to help her understand,_
_so he must want her to learn more about crocodiles)_

**Note to Teacher**


Unit 2 specifically focuses on the reading fluency skills of phrasing, reading
rate, and expression. The Fluency Self-Reflection Rubric is specifically
designed to highlight those skills but does not represent the entire spectrum
of reading fluency skills. The Fluency Supplement, available in the program’s
online materials, was created to accompany Grade 3 materials and is for use
at your discretion. It consists of short poetry, fiction, nonfiction selections,
and Reader’s Theater. These additional text selections provide opportunities
for students to practice reading with fluency and prosody. The selections
within a given unit can be used in any order, though they are arranged in the
supplement according to word count, starting with the shortest selections.
The rubric displayed on the Fluency Self-Reflection Rubric matches the one
provided in the Fluency Supplement.

  - Introduce _–ed_ and _–ing_ as suffixes, and explain how they change the
meaning of a word.


  - Ask: Do the meanings of _–ed_ and _–ing_ change when added to the end of a
word? _(The meanings of –ed and –ing do not change.)_


  - Explain to students that sometimes, adding _–ed_ or _–ing_ requires changing
the word’s form because letters have to be removed, replaced, or doubled.
However, this unit will focus on words that do not need to change to
accommodate the _–ed_ or _–ing_ suffixes.


  - Write the words _land_ and _climb_ on the board. Prompt students to turn to a
partner and orally add the suffixes _–ed_ and _–ing_ to each word, making a new
word _(landing, landed, climbing, climbed)_ .


  - Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share: How did adding each suffix change
the meaning of _land_ and _climb_ ? _(Adding –ed to each word makes the action_
_something that has already happened. Adding –ing to each word makes the_
_action something that is ongoing or something that is currently going on.)_


  - Write _plant_ and _look_ on the board.

   - Read the sentence. Invite a student volunteer to the board to identify and
underline the word with the suffix _–ed_ or _–ing_ _(adapting)_ .


   - Use sound-by-sound blending to decode the word.

   - Clap the syllables while saying the word, prompting students to echo the
clapping and pronunciation of the word.


   - Circle the suffix _(–ing)_ . Ask students to stand and walk in place _(to_
_represent the suffix –ing)_ or take a few steps backward _(to represent the_
_suffix –ed)_ based on the suffix in the word. Confirm that students should
be walking in place.


 - Read the meaning of the base word.


 - Determine how the meaning changed with the addition of the suffix.


   - Think aloud the meaning of the word adapt and how adding –ing helps
readers understand that it means that the change is happening at the
present time.


 - Organize students into small groups.


 - Focus students’ attention on questions 2–4 of Activity Page 11.1.


 - Direct students to follow the process they just practiced to identify the
meaning of and define words with the suffixes _–ed_ and _–ing_ .


 - Ask students to work together and complete Activity Page 11.1 with their

providing feedback for proper letter formation of cursive writing. Offer
feedback such as:


   - “Ensure that your letters are properly spaced and don’t run into each
other.”


   - “Focus on maintaining consistent slant and angle throughout your
writing.”


 - Instruct groups to choose one of the words to silently pantomime _(adapting,_
_confirmed, expecting,_ and _destroyed)_ . Invite each group to act out the

- Point out that the next section of the Reader includes a lengthy dialogue
between two characters, Annie and Lenny the Leopard.


- Ask students to partner read the dialogue. Partner A will be Annie. Partner B
will be Lenny.


- Guide each group in marking which paragraphs contain dialogue spoken by
each character.


- While in partner reading, coach students to use appropriate expression to
relay their assigned dialogue.


- Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension, as well as to check for
students’ ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or
multiple-meaning words. Example prompts include:


1. **Inferential:** What conclusions can you draw from the text about leopards
running long distances? _(Their legs are powerful and can run quickly, but_
_only for short distances.)_


2. **Evaluative:** What key details on page 48 support the idea that trees help
keep leopards safe? _(Sleeping in trees keeps leopards safe from other_


Foundational Skills 2


_animals. They observe other animals from the trees, They can hide their food_
_in trees, They are good climbers and can grip the limbs to avoid falling out.)_


3. **Inferential:** How do Lenny’s words about traveling and hunting alone
change Annie’s feelings about her brother? _(She thought differently about_
_tagging along. It would be lonely without him.)_


 - Ensure that students are speaking coherently about the Reader by using the
following sentence stems:


   - The details on p. 48 support the idea that... Annie changes her feelings
towards her brother because... After reading the text, I can see that
leopards...


~~**WRAP UP (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students open to Activity Page 12.2. Invite a student volunteer to read
the directions aloud.


 - Move students into pairs. Clarify that students will work together to
determine the key events to include in their retelling of pages 46–52 of their
Reader. Point out that the prompts can be used as hints, but they do not
need to answer each one of them.


 - Circulate and monitor as students write in cursive on Activity Page 12.2
providing feedback for proper letter formation. Offer feedback such as:


   - “Check that your loops and tails are formed smoothly and connect to the
next letter.”


   - “You’re doing well with your cursive! Pay attention to the slant of your
letters. Try to keep them all at the same angle.”

###### Additional Support


~~**MORE HELP WITH SUFFIXES**~~


  - To assist students in accurately using words with the suffixes _–ed_ and
_–ing_, provide students with sentence frames that have a definition already
incorporated into the sentence that represents the _–ed_ or _–ing_ form of the
word. Students then read a word list with definitions of the base word and
choose the correct base word for the sentence. Students determine whether
to add the – _ed_ or _–ing_ suffix based on the definition in the sentence.


  - Later in this program, students will learn the suffixes _-ness_, _-y_, and _-ful_ .
Challenge students to apply these suffixes to the base words presented in
this lesson and determine if they make real words.


~~**MORE HELP WITH HIGH FREQUENCY WORDS**~~


  - At this point in the program, students have been introduced to a number of
high-frequency words. Consider compiling these into a reference sheet or on
a Word Wall to write a closely-related passage.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today, the students will begin the multi-part Assessment. In the first part,
you will work one-on-one with students to complete the Fluency Assessment.
Students will engage in a review activity while awaiting their turn for the
assessment. Remind students to use a whisper voice, since testing will be
taking place concurrently with other activities.


You will most likely need more than one day to test each student; you may
plan on using time during the following lesson to complete the Fluency
Assessment.


The second part of the assessment takes place in the next lesson. It is a
reading and spelling exercise targeting each of the skills taught in Unit 2.


**Foundational Skills**

 - Predetermine collaborative small groups. Students will each work with one
partner.


 - Prepare the Unit Review Baseball Word Cards for each student pair. Copy
and cut out each word list. Use different colored paper for the A and B
lists. The word lists have been labeled by their syllable and spelling for
teacher reference. Do not provide these answers to students as they will be
annotating the words as part of the game. Mix up the word cards and provide
an A set and a B set to each pair.


 - Make one copy of the Unit Review Baseball Game Board for each student pair.


 - Gather whiteboards and dry erase markers. Each student gets their own. In
each pair, the two markers should be different colors.


 - Provide books of varying complexity for students to choose from during SelfSustained Reading. Consider both quantitative and qualitative factors when
selecting book options. Offer a variety of genres. Encourage students to
explore any books that interest them regardless of their reading level.


**Universal Access**

 - Sort the word cards for the Unit Review Baseball Game to differentiate
according to student needs.


 - Prepare sentence stem to provide to students: In the text, I learned that __.


 - Prepare audio books for students to listen to while following along with the text.

   - Player B checks for correct spelling.

   - Both players analyze their words for a VCV syllable pattern, multiple
syllables with an open syllable, and the _–ed_ and _–ing_ suffixes.


   - Students should label the VCV syllable pattern, mark syllable division
with a /, underline the open syllable, and circle the suffix.


   - Note that every word will not have all of these elements.

   - The partners switch whiteboards and look over each other’s work.

   - If there are no missing elements, each student draws a line in their
marker color from home plate to first base on the Unit Review Baseball
Game Board, signifying a “hit.”


   - Play continues in this way so that each time a player reads, spells, and
analyzes a word correctly, a line is drawn to the next base. If on the fourth
word, the players read, spell, and analyze the word correctly, each player
draws a line from third base to home plate and marks “1 run.”


   - The partners repeat the process, ultimately striving to see how many
runs they can get in the time allotted. Have students repeat the
instructions in their own words to their partner and then begin.


~~**SELF-SUSTAINED READING (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Students will be reading independently and quietly while peers continue to
take the Fluency Assessment.


 - Transition students to quiet reading time.


 - Use a previously established protocol for selecting recreational reading materials.


 - Allow students to find comfortable places around the classroom to read.


 - Remind students of the expectations for quiet independent reading and the
importance of building reading stamina.


 - Provide suggestions for how students can maintain focus while reading, such
as a short breathing and summary exercise in which they inhale through
their nose, summarize the last read paragraph in their head and then exhale
through their mouth.


Check for Understanding


Encourage students to keep track of the books they are reading and the pages where

they started and ended. Students can record their reading progress on the Self
Sustained Reading Tracker (TR 15.1).

**Lesson 14: Fluency Assessment**


**Primary Focus:** Students will read aloud with appropriate accuracy, rate, and
expression. ~~**[TEKS 3.1.C; TEKS 3.4]**~~


~~**FLUENCY ASSESSMENT**~~


You will work individually with each student and take a running record of the
student’s oral reading of a text. For this assessment, you will take a simple,
easily calculated measure of the student’s fluency by seeing how long it
takes the student to read the text. Allow each student three minutes to read
the story. Students with proficient fluency should be able to complete the
text in this amount of time. Instruct students to coherently complete the
comprehension questions after reading the text.


  - Have one student at a time come to a quiet assessment area to read “The
Bicycle Trip” with you.


  - Ask the student for Activity Page 14.1 (Fluency Assessment) and Activity
Page 14.2 (Fluency Assessment Questions).


  - Tell the student that you are going to ask him or her to read the story aloud.
Before reading aloud, remind students to speak at an appropriate rate and
volume.


  - Explain that you are going to use a stopwatch (or a timer) to see how long it
takes the student to read the story. Tell the student that this is not a race; he
or she should read at their regular pace and not rush.


  - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the title. If you are
using a watch, write the exact Start Time, in minutes and seconds, on your
record page.


  - If you are using a stopwatch, you do not need to write down the start time
since the stopwatch will calculate the Elapsed Time.


  - As the student reads the story, make a running record on a copy of the text
using the following guidelines:


**TEKS 3.1.C** Speak coherently about the topic under discussion, employing eye contact, speaking rate, volume, enunciation,
and the conventions of language to communicate ideas effectively; **TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and
prosody) when reading grade-level text.

- When the student finishes reading the story, write the exact Finish Time in
minutes and seconds on your record sheet.


- Alternatively, if you are using a stopwatch, simply write down the Elapsed
Time in minutes and seconds.


- If the student reads very slowly, you may need to stop the reading before the
student gets to the end of the story. (Five minutes should be enough time to
get a measurement.) If the student does not read to the end, draw a vertical
line on the record sheet to indicate how far the student read. Also write down
either the Finish Time or the Elapsed Time.


- Direct the student to read and select the correct answer for each question on
Activity Page 14.2. Encourage them to reference the text as they respond.


- Repeat this process for each student.


- As needed, use the Grade 3 Fluency Record to track students’ ability to read
with appropriate rate, prosody, and accuracy.


Activity Page 14.2: Fluency Assessment


- If the reading was fairly accurate (<10 uncorrected errors), you can get a
rough (and easy) estimate of a student’s W.C.P.M. score by simply noting the
time and looking at the chart on the Unit 1 W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


- Calculate each student’s exact W.C.P.M. score using the following steps:


  - First, complete the Words section of the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.

  - Count Words Read. This is the total number of words that the student
read or attempted to read, up to the point where they stopped. It
includes words that the student read correctly, as well as words that the
student read incorrectly or skipped over. If the student attempted to


Foundational Skills 2


read the whole story, including the title, use 237 words as your total. If
the student did not finish the story, you will need to count the number of
words that the student actually attempted to read. Write the count for
Words Read in the matching box on the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


    - Count the Uncorrected Mistakes noted in your running record. This
includes words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and words
that you had to supply. Write the total in the box labeled Uncorrected
Mistakes. (A mistake that is corrected by the student is not counted as a
mistake; the student is penalized for the time he or she lost making the
correction, but not for the initial mistake.)


    - Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get Words Correct.

    - Next, complete the Time section of the activity page.

    - Calculate the Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a
stopwatch, this should already be done for you. Skip to the next step.)
If you used a watch and recorded start and stop times, you will need to
subtract the Start Time from the Finish Time to calculate the Elapsed
Time. Subtract seconds from seconds then minutes from minutes.
Calculate Time in Seconds. Multiply the number of minutes by 60 to
convert minutes to seconds, and then add the number of seconds.


    - Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then multiply by 60 to get
Words Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.).


  - As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider:


    - It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.
scores. However, a major goal for Grade 3 students is to read with
sufficient fluency to ensure comprehension and independent reading of
school assignments in subsequent grades. Exact fluency targets vary
from state to state; the national mean calculated by Hasbrouck and
Tindal in 2017 for Fall of Grade 3 is 83 W.C.P.M.


    - A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared with the score of other
students in the classroom (or grade level) and also with the national
fluency norms for the Fall of Grade 3 obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal.
Students whose scores are below the 25th percentile (59 W.C.P.M) are
experiencing serious problems in reading fluently.


Lesson 14 Fluency Assessment
**139**


- Compare the student’s W.C.P.M. score to national norms for the Fall of
Grade 3 (Hasbrouck and Tindal, 2017):

~~**LESSON AT A GLANCE**~~


Foundational Skills 2


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today, you will complete the multi-part Assessment. The Reading & Spelling
portion of the Assessment takes place during the first 20 minutes of this
lesson. Once students have completed the assessment, they will have time
for quiet recreational reading. Use time in this lesson to finish working with
students who did not complete the Fluency Assessment in the previous
lesson.


You may also use Pausing Point days to administer the optional Tricky Word
Assessment included in Teacher Resources to specific students that you
suspect may not have thoroughly mastered the Tricky Words and highfrequency words reviewed in this unit.


**Foundational Skills**

  - Provide colored pencils for students to use when checking and correcting
their spelling on Activity Page 15.2.


  - Consider preparing games used in previous lessons in this unit for review to
be available as an optional activity after assessments.


**Reading**

  - Gather books of varying complexity for students to choose from during SelfSustained Reading time.


  - Prepare the Self-Sustained Reading Tracker (TR 15.1) for students to record
their reading progress during independent reading time.


**Universal Access**

  - Provide audiobooks or books in students’ home languages as options for
recreational reading.


  - To gain additional information about students’ mastery of unit skills, provide
targeted practice to accelerate learning where errors occurred during the
Reading Assessment. Place Activity Page 15.1 in front of the student and have
them read the line(s) with the error(s). Then, ask the student to point at and
read the correct word for that line. The student’s oral response will indicate
whether the mistake was a careless error or if the student needs additional
instruction in specific letter-sound correspondences. If the student makes
more than six uncorrected mistakes, they are having problems with word
recognition and may need more practice decoding specific spellings. Use the
Reading Assessment Scoring Analysis (TR 15.2) and Spelling Assessment
Scoring Analysis (TR 15.3) to help determine and understand which
phonemes and words students missed.


Lesson 15 Reading and Spelling Assessment
**143**


- Provide a tracking tool for students to record their progress on each of the
Skills summative assessments. Guide them through the process of defining
their goals, breaking them down into smaller steps, and creating a plan of
action. Incorporate regular reflection activities where students can assess
their progress, identify obstacles, and adjust their goals as needed.


- Prepare sentence stems to provide to students:




- I think the story will be about



_ because _.

~~**READING FLUENCY PASSAGE**~~


**Reading Fluency Passages**


Note: These passages are excerpts from _A Talk with Animals_


Passage 1 (810-1000L)


When asked about her favorite moment, Annie said, “There were too

many great moments. I can’t choose a favorite.” Her parents smiled and gave

each other a high five. After the successful trip, they headed home.


Driving through the city, Annie and her parents talked about sharing their

love of travel with others. They agreed to organize their pictures and invite

family and friends over to hear about the trip.


Annie was tasked with building a fun frame for the screen where they

would share their photos. She began forming ideas of sketches of the animals

seen on the trip. Her idea was to draw and paint the animals on a large scale.

After drawing and painting, she would cut out the images and paste them on a

background. This would be her best art project yet!


Arriving at the house, Annie and her parents decided to keep the event

a surprise. The front door opened, and Nolan wrapped his little arms around

Annie’s legs. Annie began to think of how to share the trip with Nolan in a way

he could understand.


Passage 2 (610-800L)


An hour later, Annie and Nolan played “Leopard.” The game had three

moves: climbing, watching, and pouncing. Nolan added his component to the

game by screeching like an animal in the wild. If Lenny were observing the

game, Annie knew he would not like the screeching.


Annie worked on her part of the surprise for a week. She made her

animal frame and showed it to her parents. They were impressed by the level

of detail in Annie’s drawings. After collecting and organizing the pictures for

the slideshow, they were ready to invite friends to the event.


Everybody arrived expecting only a simple dinner. After dinner, Annie

and her parents guided their friends to the backyard and asked them to take a

seat. Their friends were surprised to see and hear about the trip. The pictures

and stories about the trip were the highlight of the event. Annie knew the trip

would be a memory she would cherish forever.

Teacher Instructions: Create one copy of the Foundational Skills Record per student. Use assessments
within the unit to track the student’s progress toward mastery of each standard. Use the rating system
to indicate the level of teacher support required and the space provided to take notes.


  - Students at level 1 require focused instruction to accelerate learning in a specific area. Use the
Additional Supports and Pausing Points to target areas of growth.


  - Students at levels 2 and 3 should be showing steady growth. These students would benefit from the
Take Home Materials and side-bar support suggestions within each lesson.


  - Students at level 4 are excelling. Use the side-bar challenge suggestions to increase rigor.

**VCV Syllable Patterns**


There are two types of VCV syllable patterns:


  - VC/V


     - The word has a syllable that ends with a
consonant (closed syllable).


     - The closed syllable creates a short vowel sound.


     - The word’s syllables are divided after the
consonant.


› Example: logic; log/ic


  - V/CV


     - The word has a syllable that ends with a vowel
(open syllable).


     - The open syllable creates a long vowel sound.


     - The word’s syllables are divided after the vowel.


› Example: token; to/ken

**Suffixes** _**–ed**_ **and** _**–ing**_


A suffix is a group of letters added to the end of a base word;
these letters change the meaning of the word when they are
added.


The suffixes _–ed_ and _–ing_ impact a word by changing when
an action is happening.


   - The suffix _–ed_ changes an action to mean that it has
already happened in the past.


     - Example: Diego washed the dishes after his
parents cooked a big, festive meal for their
family and friends.


› The base word _wash_ means “to clean with a
liquid.”


› Adding _–ed_ to the word _wash_ changes when
the action has happened. Diego has already
completed the action of cleaning the dishes
with a liquid.

**Reading Assessment Scoring and Analysis**


The more words a student can read and the farther the
student can progress in the assessment, the stronger his or
her preparation for the next unit of instruction.


The number of words read correctly indicates the following:


Students who score 6 or fewer words out of 10 words
correctly have minimal preparation for the next unit.


Students who score 7 out of 10 words correctly have
adequate preparation for the next unit.


Students who score 8 or more words out of 10 words
correctly have outstanding preparation for the next
unit.


After scoring the assessment, you might find it helpful to


determine which phonemes students missed that caused


them to score below the benchmark for word recognition.

**Appendix A:**
###### Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program


~~**THE SIMPLE VIEW OF READING**~~


Virtually everyone who writes about reading now recognizes that reading comprehension requires
more than just decoding ability. Many reading researchers now subscribe to a view of reading that
is known as “the simple view of reading.” This view, which is associated with reading researchers
Philip Gough and William Tunmer, holds that there are two chief elements that are crucially
important to reading comprehension: decoding skills and language comprehension ability.


To achieve reading comprehension, a person needs to be able to decode the words on the page and
then make sense of those words. The first task is made possible by decoding skills and the second
by language comprehension ability. If the person cannot decode the words on the page, she will not
be able to achieve reading comprehension, no matter how much oral language she can understand.
Even if the person can decode the words on the page, that in and of itself is still no guarantee of
reading comprehension. Thus, if a person cannot understand sentences when they hear them,
they are unlikely to understand those sentences when reading. Supporters of the simple view—and
there are a growing number of them among reading researchers—argue that a person’s reading
comprehension ability can be predicted, with a high degree of accuracy, based on two basic
measures. The first is a measure of decoding skills (e.g., a test of single word reading or pseudoword reading). The second is a measure of listening comprehension. Researchers who hold to the
simple view say, “Tell me a person’s decoding ability, as ascertained by a word-reading task, and
tell me that person’s language comprehension ability, as ascertained by a listening comprehension
task, and I can make a very accurate prediction of that person’s reading comprehension ability.” If
the person is a rapid and accurate decoder and able to understand a wide range of oral language—
for instance, classroom presentations, news items on the radio or TV, books on tape, etc.—then it is
a safe bet the person will also do well on tests of reading comprehension.


An interesting thing about the simple view of reading is that it can be expressed as an equation:





In this equation, each of the letters is a variable that stands for a specific skill:


R is a measure of reading comprehension ability.


D is a measure of decoding skills.


**224** Foundational Skills 2


C is a measure of language-comprehension ability as measured using a listening task.


Each of these skills can be quantified as a numerical value between 0 and 1, where 0 stands for no
ability whatsoever and 1 stands for perfect, not-to-be-improved-upon ability. Most people have a
skill level that falls somewhere between these two extremes.


The equation says that if you have some decoding ability (D > 0) and you also have some language
comprehension ability (C > 0), you will probably also have some reading comprehension ability (R >
0). How much reading comprehension ability you have will depend on the exact values of D and C.


What does it mean to have no decoding ability (D = 0)? It means you cannot turn printed words
into spoken words. A person who cannot decode letters on a page cannot read. The person is
illiterate.


What does it mean to have no language comprehension ability (C = 0)? It means you do not know
the language, and you cannot understand any of it when you hear other people speaking or reading
aloud in that language.


It is not very common for a person to have decoding ability (D > 0) but not language
comprehension ability (C = 0). Why would you learn to read and write a language you cannot
understand? It does happen. One famous example involves the English poet John Milton, the
author of Paradise Lost and other well-known poems. Milton went blind late in life. Since Braille had
not yet been invented, this meant he could not read for himself. Nevertheless, Milton found a way
to keep learning from books: he had friends and relatives read the books aloud for him. However,
he was not always able to find a scholar who had the free time and the ability needed to read to him
in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and other ancient languages. The solution? Milton taught his daughters
to decode these languages so they could read books in those languages aloud to him. Milton did
not teach his daughters the actual languages—the thousands of words and tens of thousands
of meanings. That would have been a difficult, time-consuming task. He only taught them the
rules they would need to turn letters into sounds. Thus, his daughters acquired solid decoding
skills for these languages (D > 0), but they would have scored a zero on any measure of language
comprehension (C = 0). They could turn symbols into sounds, but they had no idea what the
sounds meant. Milton, on the other hand, due to his blindness, had no functional decoding skills (D
= 0). However, by virtue of his great learning, he was able to understand Hebrew, Latin, and Greek
when they were read aloud to him (C > 0). Between Milton and his daughters, you might say, there
was reading comprehension (R), but the younger generation brought the decoding skills (D) and
the elderly poet brought the language comprehension (C).


The Milton example is an unusual one, but it is possible to give a less unusual one. A decent teacher
can teach you to decode Russian letters (or the letters used in many other writing systems) during
a couple days of intensive work. Since you already know a lot about reading, all you would need to
learn is which sound values the unfamiliar letters stand for. Once you learned that, you would be
able to sound out most of the words in the language, but nobody would claim that you are reading
Russian. You would have some rudimentary decoding skills (D > 0), but you would be lacking
language comprehension (C = 0). You would be able to pronounce words, but you would not be able
to make sense of them. Essentially, you would be doing what Milton’s daughters did.


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program **225**


~~**HOW THESE IDEAS INFORM THIS PROGRAM**~~


Although this may seem very abstract and theoretical, there are two ideas here that are very
important for reading instruction and for understanding this program. The first important idea
is that reading comprehension depends crucially on both decoding skills (D) and language
comprehension ability (C); the second is that language comprehension ability takes much longer
to acquire than decoding skills.


Milton chose to teach his daughters decoding skills because he could teach those relatively
quickly. It would have taken him much, much longer to build up their language comprehension
abilities. Likewise, in the hypothetical example just given, a decent teacher could teach you to
decode Russian print in a few days of intensive instruction, but he or she would need to keep
working with you for many weeks—possibly even many years—to teach you enough Russian words
and phrases to understand a movie, make sense of a radio report, or read a short story.


You are facing a similar situation as a teacher in the early grades. You want your students to learn
to read. A crucial first step is to teach them decoding skills. Strong decoding skills can be taught
to most young children throughout Grades K–3. It takes longer to teach decoding skills to young
children who are learning to read for the first time than it does to teach the same skills to adults
who have already learned to read in another language, and it takes longer to teach decoding
skills in English-speaking countries because English spelling is rather complex; but even so,
most students can acquire basic decoding ability in the early grades. The children will continue
to automatize their decoding skills, learn new spelling patterns, and build fluency for many more
years, but the basics can be taught in Grades K–3.


That is not the case with language comprehension ability. It will take you and your school system
a long time to build up your students’ language comprehension ability because this is not a job
you can accomplish in a single school year. Rather, language comprehension ability is acquired
over many years. Your students began to develop a rudimentary ability to understand language
even before they could speak and continued to increase their language comprehension abilities
throughout the preschool years. They will make even more gains in your classroom and the
classrooms they join after yours. With each new sentence they read or hear, and each new subject
they study in school, they will be building up background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural
literacy, thus increasing the range of materials they are equipped to understand, first orally and
later via reading. The more you teach them and the more you expose them to, the more they will be
able to understand. It takes a long time to build up the vocabulary and knowledge needed to make
sense of most stories in a newspaper or magazine, but this buildup is crucial for your students’
reading abilities: no matter how good their decoding skills may be, they will not understand what
they read unless they have the language comprehension ability to make sense of the words they
decode.


The program includes two strands of instruction, and these strands correspond with the
elements of reading isolated in the simple view of reading. The Skills Strand is meant to build
students’ decoding skills (D), while the Knowledge Strand is meant to build students’ language
comprehension ability (C) by exposing them to vocabulary, concepts, and ideas through


**226** Foundational Skills 2


frequent reading aloud. It is important to understand that both strands are crucial for reading
comprehension in later grades. You may feel the decoding skills taught in the Skills Strand are
more important to teach in the early grades, and certainly, this is the area where you can expect to
have the most immediate impact, but it is important that you not neglect language comprehension
ability. Remember, it takes many years to build up enough vocabulary and general knowledge to
understand a wide range of printed materials. The building of background knowledge needs to
begin in kindergarten (if not before) and continue throughout the elementary and middle school
years.


If students are not building their language comprehension ability in the early grades, their reading
scores are likely to begin to fall off in Grade 4 and later. This has been called the “fourth-grade
slump,” and it occurs because material assessed on reading tests changes over time. As students’
progress through the grades, test questions focus less on rudimentary decoding skills and more
on comprehension—and comprehension depends on having sufficient vocabulary, background
knowledge, and cultural literacy to understand the words you are decoding. Thus, the importance
of language comprehension ability increases with time. A weakness in this area may not show up
on tests in early grades, but it will show up in later elementary grades.


This has been well documented in research. In one very interesting study, researchers at the
University of Kansas looked at measurements of reading comprehension (R), decoding/word
recognition (D), and listening comprehension (C) for the same 570 students in the second, fourth,
and eighth grades. They found the two factors D and C accurately predicted R in each grade,
but that C became more important, in the sense that it explained more of the variation among
students over time. The measure of decoding (D) was extremely important in the second-grade
results. Twenty-seven percent of the variance in reading comprehension in second grade could
be explained by decoding skills (D) alone. Only 9 percent of the variance could be explained
by listening comprehension (C) alone. By fourth grade, however, the measure of listening
comprehension had begun to account for more variance: the unique contribution of C rose to 21
percent, while the equivalent number for D fell. By eighth grade, fully 36 percent of the variance
in reading comprehension scores could be explained with reference to the children’s listening
comprehension ability. The unique contribution of D sank even further. In other words, while
reading comprehension depended on D and C at every stage, as the simple view would predict,
C explained more and more of the variation among students as time went by. What this tells us
is that, once the intricacies of decoding are mastered (and in English, this takes some time),
reading comprehension depends more and more heavily on language comprehension. Language
comprehension depends on background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural literacy.


~~**TWO MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT READING AND WRITING**~~


The Skills Strand teaches the mechanics of both reading and writing. It is based on the most
current research on reading and writing, but at the same time, it has been written in opposition to
some ideas that have been very influential in elementary education in recent decades. Two of those
ideas are:


Learning to read and write is natural.


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program **227**


Learning to read and write is easy.


Both ideas have great emotional appeal. Unfortunately, both are wrong.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT NATURAL**~~


Many scholars have argued that spoken language is natural for human beings. The cognitive
scientist Stephen Pinker, for example, has argued that human beings have a language instinct,
meaning that humans are born with an innate capacity for learning language. This may turn out to
be true. It is at least a plausible theory since historians, linguists, and anthropologists have never
found a human culture that does not use language. When something is universal, it may turn out to
be natural.


What is true of oral language is not necessarily true of written language. In fact, with written
language, we know we are dealing with something that is not natural or innate because we know
when and where writing was invented, and we know that, even today, not all languages have a
system of writing. There are still hundreds of languages in the world that are spoken but not
written or read.


Ten thousand years ago this was the norm rather than an exception. At that time, there were
probably no human beings who knew how to read or write. According to the linguist Florian
Coulmas, the idea of writing down language was probably developed independently by three
ancient cultures: the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, and the Chinese. Each used a slightly different
system, and the mechanisms these pioneers developed for recording speech then spread from one
culture to another, evolving as they went. If these initial inventors had not come up with schemes
for writing down speech, we might all be illiterate today.


Writing is many things. It is an art that can be taught and learned. It is an invention—one of the
greatest inventions in human history. It is a technology enabling us to do things we could not do
without it—a technology every bit as exciting and amazing as airplane flight or electric power. But
it is not natural. The same is true of reading, which is simply the process of unpacking, or decoding,
what somebody else has written.


Reading and writing are both highly artificial. We tend to recoil at that word. We have internalized
the idea that natural is good and artificial is bad. Therefore, we think reading must be natural. In
fact, as the reading researcher Philip Gough has written, reading is a highly unnatural act.


The first step toward good reading and writing instruction is to understand that reading and
writing are artificial—but not necessarily in a bad sense. We need to remind ourselves that the
word artificial derives from the word art. To say reading and writing are forms of art that had to be
invented and need to be taught to children does not make reading and writing any less wonderful
or important. On the contrary, it makes these things more wonderful and precious, and it also
emphasizes the importance of your job as a teacher. There is no job more important than teaching
young children the magnificent, valuable, and highly unnatural arts of reading and writing.


**228** Foundational Skills 2


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT EASY**~~


The second idea noted earlier, that learning to read and write is easy, is also mistaken. Reading and
writing are complex behaviors, and they are more complex in English than in many other languages
because English has a complicated spelling system. In Spanish, for example, the relationships
between letters and sounds are mostly one-to-one, meaning each sound is usually written with
one spelling, and each spelling unit is usually pronounced one way. This is not the case in English.
To read and write English with a high degree of accuracy, there is quite a lot that students need to
learn.


As a way of demonstrating the complexity involved in learning to read and write in English, suppose
we attempted to list all the discrete bits of information a person needs to know to be able to read
and write in English. As a starting point, we might begin with the 26 letters and argue that these
are the 26 things one really needs to learn to read and write English. However, for each letter, one
eventually needs to learn not only the letter shape but also the letter name (to be able to read
abbreviations and initials). So that is 52 bits of information.


That is a good start, but we must not stop there. In English, all letters can be written in uppercase
and lowercase forms, and the uppercase forms are not always the same as the lowercase forms.
Compare ‘B’ to ‘b,’ ‘D’ to ‘d,’ ‘H’ to ‘h,’ ‘R’ to ‘r,’ and ‘Q’ to ‘q.’ At least 16 uppercase letters have a
slightly different form than the matching lowercase letters. So, we must raise our estimate of the
complexity of the English writing system to 68 bits of information.


We are not done yet. Students must also know the 44 sounds these letters stand for. That raises
our estimate of the complexity to 112.


If there was a simple one-to-one relationship between letters and sounds, that might be a good
estimate of the code’s complexity. Unfortunately, the relationships between sounds and letters in
English are quite complicated. The 44 sounds of English can be spelled many ways. In our work on
this program, we have identified 150 spellings that are frequent enough to be worth teaching in the
early grades. That boosts our estimate of the complexity of the code to 262.


In addition, students need to learn to track from left to right, blend sounds into words (when
reading), and segment words into sounds (when writing and spelling). They need to learn a handful
of symbols used in writing, including the period, comma, exclamation point, question mark,
quotation mark, and apostrophe. That raises our estimate of code complexity to about 270 bits of
information.


We could boost the estimate even higher by adding Tricky Words and unusual spellings or by
pointing out that many letters in English can be pronounced in different ways. We could also point
out that reading a word like thin requires students to group the first two letters and attach them to
one sound, and reading a word like cake requires students to scan ahead, see the ‘e,’ and realize it
controls the pronunciation of the ‘a’ earlier.


Even without these additions, the English writing system is quite complicated.


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program **229**


~~**THE PROBLEM WITH WHOLE LANGUAGE**~~


On a conservative estimate, there are 270 bits of knowledge a person needs to be able to read and
write English. It is unwise to ask students to tackle all this complexity at once and hope they will
figure it out. Yet that is precisely what is done in so-called “Whole Language” approaches. Whole
Language instruction is based on the assumption that learning to read is natural and not difficult,
so reading skills can be allowed to develop gradually, without much explicit instruction. Lots of
students in Whole Language classrooms do manage to figure out the English writing system, but
many others do not. Whole Language ideas have tremendous emotional appeal, but the Whole
Language approach is actually a recipe for leaving many children behind. It is an especially risky
strategy for disadvantaged children.


A much better strategy is to introduce the English spelling code explicitly, beginning with the
easiest, least ambiguous, and most frequently used parts of the code and then adding complexity
gradually. That is the central strategy on which this program is based.


The strategy adopted in this program is the same strategy that successful coaches use when
teaching children, a sport such as tennis. The successful coach does not ask students to learn
“Whole Tennis” and soak up the necessary skills all at once by trying to hit all different kinds of
shots the first day on the court. Instead, the successful coach teaches the student to hit a forehand
ground stroke and provides lots of practice hitting forehands. Then the coach moves on to teach
a backhand ground stroke, then a forehand volley, then a backhand volley, then a serve, then an
overhead smash, then a drop shot, etc. With each element taught, the student becomes a stronger
and more complete player. In the same way, this program begins by teaching the most common
and least ambiguous spellings for sounds and then moves on to introduce the more complex parts
of the writing system.


~~**KEY ASPECTS OF THE SKILLS STRAND**~~


Some key aspects of the Skills Strand are listed below.


  - This program teaches reading and writing in tandem, since they are inverse processes. English
writing involves making pictures of sounds; reading involves translating those pictures back into
sounds and blending the sounds to make words.


  - This program includes explicit, systematic phonics instruction in which students are taught target
skills needed to independently decode and encode words This program explicitly teaches lettersound correspondences as opposed to leaving students to figure these out on their own or deduce
them by analyzing familiar whole words (as in some forms of “analytic” phonics).


  - This program focuses on sounds, or phonemes, as the primary organizing principle of the program,
rather than letters.


  - This program focuses consistently on the phoneme, or single sound, and not on larger units.
Students learn to read words that contain onsets, rimes, and consonant clusters, but they learn to
view and process these larger units as combinations of smaller phoneme-level units. Rimes like _-ick_
and initial clusters like _st-_ are not taught as units but as combinations.


**230** Foundational Skills 2


  - This program uses a synthetic phonics approach that teaches students to read by blending through
the whole word; it does not teach multiple cueing strategies, use of pictures as a primary resource in
decoding, or part-word guessing.


  - This program begins by teaching the most common or least ambiguous spelling for a sound (the
basic code spelling); later it teaches spelling alternatives for sounds that can be spelled several
different ways. Thus, the system is kept simple at first, and complexity is added bit by bit as
students gain confidence and automatize their reading and writing skills.


  - This program includes words, phrases, and stories for students to read and activity pages for
them to complete that allow for focused, distributed practice working with the letter-sound
correspondences they have been taught.


  - This program does not require students to read words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have learned. In other words, all words students are asked to read as
part of the program are decodable, either because they are composed entirely of letter-sound
correspondences students have been taught or because they are Tricky Words that have been
taught. This means students have a chance to begin reading words and stories that are completely
decodable before tackling words and stories that are full of spelling alternatives.


  - This program does not require students to write words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have been taught. In other words, students are only asked to write words that
can be spelled (at least plausibly if not always correctly) using the code knowledge they have been
taught.


  - This program carefully controls the introduction of Tricky Words and words with ambiguous or rare
spellings, preferring to have students learn to read and write with regular words that can be blended
and spelled by the letter-sound correspondences taught.


  - High-frequency words compiled from a research-based list for Grade 3 are also taught as they
appear in the Unit Readers. They are revisited frequently to build automaticity and fluency.


  - This program avoids letter names because what is important for reading is not the letter name but
the sound value the letter stands for. To read the word cat, it is essential to know /k/ /a/ /t/, not
“see aay tee.”


~~**THE BASIC AND ADVANCED CODE**~~


The program teaches the highly complex letter-sound correspondences of the English language
in an explicit and systematic manner in Kindergarten–Grade 3. Students are taught how the 26
letters (or graphemes) of the alphabet are used in various combinations to represent 44 sounds
(or phonemes). There are approximately 150 different spellings for these sounds.


Students are first taught the basic code for each of the 44 phonemes. The basic code spelling for
a sound is usually the most common, or the least ambiguous, spelling for a sound. By learning
these letter-sound correspondences first, students experience a high degree of predictability, and
therefore success, in decoding words with these spellings.


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program **231**


Basic code spellings may be single letters, such as these spellings and sounds: ‘a’ > /a/, ‘e’ > /e/,
‘b’ > /b/, and ‘m’ > /m/. Basic code spellings may also include digraphs, or two letters to represent
a sound, such as _ee_  - /ee/, _oy_  - /oi/, _ou_  - /ow/, _sh_  - /sh/, and _th_  - /th/. Other basic code
spellings include separated digraphs, such as _a_e_  - /ae/, and _o_e_  - /oe/.


The advanced code consists of all other spelling alternatives (over 100) that may be used to spell
the 44 phonemes in English. Examples of alternative spellings include _mm_  - /m/, _ss_  - /s/, _c_  - /s/,
_g_ - /j/, _ay_ - /ae/, and _ey_ - /ee/. Some of these spelling alternatives occur relatively frequently
in the English language, while others are quite rare. See the charts provided for the basic and
advanced code.

~~**TRICKY WORDS**~~


The term _Tricky Word_ is used in this program to refer to a word that does not “play by the rules” of
spelling and/or pronunciation. Examples of Tricky Words include _one_, _said_, _of_, _were_, and _have_ .


You can describe the trickiness of a Tricky Word like said in two ways. If you think about it from
a spelling point of view, you might say that the word said is tricky because the sound /e/ is not
spelled with an ‘e,’ as you might expect it would be. On the other hand, if you think about it from a
reading point of view, you might say the word is tricky because the letters _ai_ are not pronounced
/ae/, as you might expect they would be. Either way you look at it, _said_ is a Tricky Word.


But notice that the word is not completely irregular, either. The first letter and the last letter are
pronounced exactly as you would expect. It is only the second and third letters, representing the
vowel sound, that are not sounded as you would expect. Or, if you prefer to look at things from the
speller’s perspective, you might say the first and last sound are spelled just as you would expect; it
is only the middle sound—the vowel sound—that is spelled irregularly. This is the case with many
Tricky Words: most of them have a regular part (or parts) and then a tricky part. You will find that
the tricky part involves the vowel sound and its spelling.


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program **233**


When you are asked to teach a Tricky Word, the guidelines in the Teacher Guide will generally
prompt you to begin by reminding students that not all words play by the rules and words that do
not play by the rules are called Tricky Words. Next, the Teacher Guide generally suggests you write
the Tricky Word on the board. You may wish to ask a student to read the word as he or she thinks it
might be sounded (i.e., to blend according to the normal procedures). Alternatively, you can read
Tricky Word that way yourself. Then you can point out how the word is pronounced. Once you have
established the actual pronunciation, you can point out and/or discuss what is regular and what
is irregular about the word. Most Tricky Words have at least some parts pronounced exactly the
way you would expect. For example, as noted above, the first and last letter in _said_ are pronounced
just as one would expect. After discussing the regular parts, you should then draw attention to the
tricky part (or parts) of the word, pointing out letters not pronounced as one might expect they
would be (e.g., the _ai_ in _said_ ). This is the part of the word that students just must remember.


By drawing attention to the regular as well as the irregular parts of the word, you teach students
that Tricky Words are only partial exceptions to the normal rules of reading and writing. (They are
not so much irregular as they are a little less regular than most words.) There are some parts of
the word spelled as you would expect and pronounced as expected. Then there are some others
that are not. There is a subtle but important difference between teaching Tricky Words this way and
teaching them as single entities that must be memorized as wholes, as if every part of the word
were unpredictable.


Note that some Tricky Words are part of spelling patterns. For example, the words _he_, _she_, _we_,
_be_, and _me_ are taught as Tricky Words in earlier grades because it is hard to write stories without
them. However, once the ‘e’ spelling alternative for /ee/ is taught, these Tricky Words can be seen
as part of a larger pattern that includes words like _replay_ and _prefix_ . Other Tricky Words, such as
_one_ and _of_, remain tricky even when most of the spelling alternatives have been taught. By Grade
3, students have been taught the majority of the code knowledge needed to decode most words in
the English language. As such, there is less of an emphasis on Tricky Words in the Grade 3 program.


~~**SIGHT WORDS AND TRICKY WORDS**~~


One of the most common terms in the world of reading instruction is _sight word_ . Unfortunately, this
is also a rather ambiguous and potentially confusing term. Educators use the term sight word in
two different senses. For some people, sight words are high-frequency words that students need to
encounter frequently and learn to decode rapidly and effortlessly. Other people use the term sight
word in a more restrictive sense, to refer to words that cannot be sounded out using letter-sound
correspondences and may need to be taught as exceptions.


In this program, we define these terms as follows:


  - A Tricky Word is a word that does not play by the rules. It is a word containing at least one part that
cannot be read correctly via blending or cannot be spelled correctly using the code knowledge
taught so far.


  - A sight word is a high-frequency word that we want students to see many, many times and learn to
read quickly and eventually learn to recognize rapidly.


**234** Foundational Skills 2


The main difference here is that a Tricky Word always contains some irregular element, whereas a
sight word might or might not. The Venn diagram below shows the relationship between these two
categories, as understood within this program.

|Tricky Words|Overlap|Sight Words|
|---|---|---|
|colonel, aisle, Aarol, ballet|of, to, once, one, was, who, said|in, it, at, on, if, then, this, did, and, with|



The words in the left circle are Tricky Words: each one contains at least one set of letters that is not
pronounced the way you would expect. Or, if you prefer to look at matters from a spelling point of
view, you could say each contains at least one sound that is not written as you would expect it to
be.


The words in the right circle are sight words: they are all high-frequency words that students
should see frequently and eventually learn to recognize rapidly.


The shaded area in the middle shows that there is considerable overlap between the two categories
(which is probably why the two senses of _sight word_ are regularly confused). Some words qualify
as sight words because they are used a lot and as Tricky Words because they are not pronounced
(or written) as you would expect. These are irregular words (and therefore hard to read and write,
at least first) and very common (and important for student success). They are candidates for
special instruction, and many of them are given special instruction in this program.


The area on the far left shows words that are tricky in the sense that they depart from the most
common spelling patterns. But these words do not qualify as sight words on most lists because
they are not especially common. Words of this sort are sprinkled throughout the language but do
not receive much attention because they are only used occasionally. Students can learn them as
the need arises in upper grades.


The area on the far right shows words that qualify as sight words because they are very common
and should be rapidly recognized but do not qualify as Tricky Words because they are completely
regular. All of them are pronounced and spelled exactly as you would expect. They can be sounded
out and set down on paper using basic letter-sound correspondences taught in Kindergarten.
Students need to see these words—and they will see most of them frequently in the materials—but
you probably do not need to give these words special attention, and you certainly should not ask
students to memorize them as wholes. Students can simply read them by sounding them out. After
sounding them out several times, they will begin to recognize them more rapidly. In other words, no
special teaching is required for these regular high-frequency words. All that is required is multiple
exposures, and students are likely to get multiple exposures since the words are so common.


~~**SIGHT WORDS**~~


The guidelines for teaching Tricky Words are outlined in the section above. As noted above, we use
the term sight word in this program to refer to high-frequency words that we want students to see
many, many times and learn to recognize rapidly.


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program **235**


The program does place the initial emphasis on reading regular words. But that does not mean
high-frequency sight words are not being learned. In fact, as noted above, many sight words are
completely regular and become decodable as students learn letter-sound correspondences. This
means that the program is a very effective program for teaching sight words.


To illustrate this, consider one of the most widely used lists of sight words, Dr. Edward Fry’s
“Instant Word” list. Fry’s list is divided into groups of 100. For illustration purposes, we will focus
on the first three lists of 100 words, 300 words in all. These are words that Fry recommends be
mastered in the first several grades of school. We found more than half of the Fry Instant Words
become fully decodable in kindergarten, meaning they are either regular and can be sounded out
using the letter-sound correspondences taught, or they are Tricky Words explicitly taught in the
program.


**HIGH-FREQUENCY WORDS**


In addition to addressing Tricky Words and tricky spellings, this program emphasizes the reading
and spelling of high-frequency words carefully selected from word lists compiled by researchers
Edward William Dolch and Edward Fry. These lists are instrumental in aiding students, particularly
young learners, to become more proficient readers by focusing on words that frequently appear in
English reading materials.


Specifically for grade 3 students, the lists include 132 words, of which this program provides
explicit instruction for 98. These words are selected based on their prevalence across various unit
Readers, ensuring instruction is both relevant and practical. Instruction is integrated into lessons
at points where students will naturally encounter these words within the assigned sections of the
Readers.


The program encourages students to identify and recall previously taught high-frequency words
to reinforce learning, thereby gradually expanding their lexicon through repeated exposure. This
strategic approach ensures that students learn to recognize and use these essential words and
improve their reading fluency and comprehension.


The process for determining which high-frequency words to teach and the timing of their
introduction is structured and integral to the curriculum, designed to optimize comprehension
and retention. Each unit focuses on 8-12 high-frequency words. These words are carefully selected
based on their relevance as content words central to the unit’s Reader and their frequent usage
throughout the Reader. To facilitate learning, these words are introduced by sounding them out and
employing Spelling Cards, which aid in decoding.


As the unit progresses, the high-frequency words highlighted in the Reading section of each
lesson are consistently reviewed, ensuring recognition and understanding of these words both in
and out of context. To reinforce learning and maintain engagement, focused high-frequency word
decode/encode games found in the Reading section are incorporated every few days, strategically
reviewing one-third of the previously encountered words to reinforce retention.


**236** Foundational Skills 2


To further consolidate learning, a final high-frequency word game that reviews all the words
introduced in the unit is played at designated Pausing Points, ensuring multiple opportunities
to interact with and master these words. Additionally, fluency checkpoints are conducted to
monitor progress in automaticity and fluency, essential components of reading proficiency. This
comprehensive approach ensures that students are not only exposed to high-frequency words but
also engage with them in a variety of contexts, enhancing reading skills and confidence.

|Unit|High Frequency Word Scope and Sequence|

|1|night, about, tree, story, thought, every, began, hard, important, river, small, near|
|2|talk, walk, head, eyes, book, being, run, drink, long, much, keep, group|

|10|eight, school, enough, show, watch, song, almost, list|



~~**CUSTOMIZING AND ADAPTING THE PROGRAM**~~


This is a highly structured and sequenced program. We are unapologetic about that, as we believe
the structure and sequence will be very helpful to students as they work to learn the English
spelling code. However, this is not a scripted program in which teachers are required to read
the manual and give one of a handful of approved responses. We expect—indeed, we hope—
teachers will tweak the phrasing and come up with ways to customize, personalize, and adapt the
instruction.


Our goal has been to put things in a logical order and provide all the guidance and support
necessary for a new teacher, or a teacher new to this kind of phonics instruction.


At the same time, we believe there is room for experienced and creative teachers to customize
and adapt the program. Indeed, some of the exercises included in this version of the program were
developed by teachers in our pilot programs!


Sometimes in the lessons, we give exact phrasing that we suggest you use; more often, however,
we give indirect phrasing and/or encourage you to explain something using your own words. You
should feel free to make changes to the phrasing. For example, you may prefer to speak of “a
picture of a sound” or a “spelling.” Later in the year, you may want to teach the term digraph, or
you may prefer to refer to the letters in a digraph as a “letter team” or as “buddy letters.” There are
many ways to customize the program and the language while preserving the basic instructional
principles and sequence of instruction.


For the presentation of words, you may write on a chalkboard, a whiteboard, chart paper, an


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program **237**


overhead projector, a document camera, or the projection system of your choice. A projection
system works especially well for activity pages since it allows the teacher to model the task exactly
as the students will be completing it. You may use a pocket chart, a magnetic board with magnetic
letters, an overhead projector with letters cut from a transparency, or a smart board. Many
modifications of this sort can be made without adversely impacting the quality of the instruction.


You should also always feel free to add additional activities and activity pages that are consistent
with our philosophy of instruction. You should always feel free to respond to the teachable
moment, even if it leads you slightly off the path laid out in the Teacher Guide.


There are only a handful of things you should not do:


You should not skip a lesson in which new code knowledge is taught. If you do, students will lack
important code knowledge, untaught spellings will begin to appear in their word lists and on their
activity pages, and the lessons will start to make less sense to them.


For the same reasons, you should not reorder the lessons. The program relies heavily on
sequencing, and instruction will be confused and less effective if the lessons are reordered.


~~**SMALL-GROUP WORK**~~


Large parts of this program have been written for whole-group instruction, but the program can
be customized to allow for small-group instruction of various kinds. You will note that there are
Support and Challenge sidebars sprinkled throughout the lessons that will guide you in how to
differentiate instruction for your students, while still using the whole-class approach described in
the lessons.


Since some students will learn the new information right away while others will need more practice,
you may wish to do small-group work to follow up the initial introduction of code knowledge.
You will note that many lessons do include suggestions for small groups; you should feel free to
adapt to these and other lessons as they best meet the needs of your students. We have seen this
program taught very effectively in small groups and in workstations students visit on rotation.


~~**ADJUSTING THE SPEED OF INSTRUCTION**~~


This sequence will work for most children. However, all children are different, and all classrooms
are different. Some classrooms may need more time to master concepts than others. The program
has been designed so the pace of instruction can be adjusted as needed.


The most important thing for you to know is that you can pause at any point in the program.
If students are not learning the material, simply stop where you are and do additional work to
remediate or reteach as needed. All lessons contain some materials you can use if you pause.


In addition, at the end of each unit there is a “Pausing Point.” If the end-of-unit assessment or your


**238** Foundational Skills 2


observations suggest some members of the class need additional time to master the concepts
taught in the unit, this is an especially good place to stop and provide additional practice and
review. The Teacher Guides include additional work at each Pausing Point. They will typically
provide enough for at least 1–2 days of additional work. The materials provided in the Pausing
Point can be used in various ways. Sometimes you may wish to have all students do the same
activity or activity page. At other times you may wish to work individually or in small groups with
students who are struggling with a particular concept.


To slow down instruction, you can pause either in the middle of a unit or at a Pausing Point. We do
not recommend that you attempt to speed up the sequence of instruction. The program lays out an
ambitious program of instruction.


The Grade 3 program of instruction should work well for a wide range of students. You should begin
with the assumption that the Grade 3 program is an appropriate option for all students in the class.


Inevitably, however, there will be differences in learning. Students learn at different rates. Some
students will pick up the material quickly; others will have more difficulty. There are many
strategies for dealing with this. In general, we encourage you to try to keep most of the class
together if it makes sense. It is much easier to teach one set of students at roughly the same level
than it is to teach two or three groups at very different levels.


If you find some students are lagging, you may still be able to keep the class together for the main
lessons but find extra time two to four times a week to work with those students who seem to need
extra practice.


If this is not sufficient, you may eventually need to regroup some students. As we note in Lessons
4–5 of this unit, it is especially important to administer the placement assessment to all students
at the start of the year. We strongly recommend that teachers then use an “across grade” approach
to grouping students. If there are two classrooms, these two teachers should look at all of the
Grade 3 students in both classrooms and consider regrouping students for Skills instruction only,
with one teacher taking the class of students who need review and more practice, while the other
teacher works with those students ready to move on to Grade 3 Skills instruction. It will likely be
worthwhile to reconvene at multiple times during the year to plan across the grade level, using
the end-of-unit assessments. In this way, students in need of remediation can be moved to the
appropriate group, while students who are making progress can advance.

**Appendix C:**
###### Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words


Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught will enable students to read one
syllable word with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences is no
guarantee that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllabic words. To this
end, most students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk and read
parts of words—syllables—to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can
then be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated, and students are
expected to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, the program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the
easiest two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is
already a familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In
addition, each syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic
familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing_, _hunt·er_, _bust·ed_ ).
The dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain doubleletter spellings for consonants, in this program, the divider is typically placed after the doubleletter spelling rather than between the two consonants (e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers
that are familiar with other ways to chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is
done, however, because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single-spelling units
since kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.). The program strives to be consistent in
representing these spellings in the way that the students have been taught to process them (e.g.,
as whole entities for a sound). (Ultimately, as students become more proficient at decoding and
chunking syllables through subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually
chunk and decode these words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding
these two-syllable words consisting of root words and suffixes relatively easy.


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable
words.


**246** Foundational Skills 2


To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


   - **Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound (e.g.,**
**/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/):** _let, pad, rod, tin, fun, pic·nic, un·til_


   - **Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /**
**ie/, /oe/, /ue/):** _cake, home, like, mule, Pete, mis·take, stam·pede_


   - **Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint, speak, proud, play, dis·may, be·low, coun·sel_


   - **R-Controlled Syllables:** _art, curb, girl, fort, clerk, tur·nip, ar·tist, fe·ver_


   - **Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /ie/,**
**/oe/, /ue/):** _go, me, hi, a·pron, fi·nal, com·pre·hend_


   - **Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple, puz·zle, raf·fle, ca·ble, ri·fle_


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


   - _Schwa Syllables:_ ben·e·fit, ap·pe·tite, a·bout, hos·pit·al, e·mo·tion


**Note:** The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately
because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


To decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these names. The names of the
syllable types are provided here only to establish a common vocabulary for teachers as they use
the materials. What is necessary, however, for students to become fluent readers of longer words in
increasingly complex text is that they be able to visually parse certain spelling patterns as syllable
chunks so they can quickly and easily decode each syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


  - When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.
_ad·mit_ _nap·kin_ _trum·pet_


  - For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed
after the double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is
because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units since kindergarten
(‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).
_traff·ic_ _muff·in_ _happ·en_


Appendix C: Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words **247**


  - When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.
_mon·ster_ _con·tract_ _pil·grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read
the first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model
for students how to blend the two syllables aloud:


  - In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the magic
‘E’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


  - Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for closed
syllables:
_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


  - In Grades 2 and 3, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to
use a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying
each possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


  - When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:
_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_


**248** Foundational Skills 2


However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There
is no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be
flexible and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to
determine whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. To recognize
whether a word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has
heard before (i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent
an additional challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a
second language.


 - If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:

_cam · el     mel · on     pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is straightforward.


 - When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings
in the words.
_ban · gle     twin · kle     sta · ble     cra · dle     tur · tle_


In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings
represent the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a
combination of stressed and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed
or weakly stressed, its vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that
linguists call a schwa. This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include



Appendix C: Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words



**249**


‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’ and ‘tion’. Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite
challenging for many students.


  - Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the
schwa sound has a particular spelling:
_a · bout     de · pos · it      med · al e · vil     nick · el     lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is a schwa syllable, but it is identified separately
because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables
accordingly throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend     non·sense     tri·cycle     re·peat     elf·ish     sad·ness     help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten—Grade
3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.
