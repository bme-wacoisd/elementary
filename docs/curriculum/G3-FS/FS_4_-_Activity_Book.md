**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 4. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. Teachers will explain these activity
pages to the students orally, using the instructions in the Teacher Guide. There are also instructions
on the activity pages for students to read themselves. The Activity Book is a student component,
which means each student should have an Activity Book.

Dear Family Member,


Your student has been reading _Frankie Figures It Out_ at
school. Have your student read this excerpt from the reader
aloud to you. Encourage your student to change their voice
to match the character speaking. After reading, have your

finishes, have a discussion with them about the importance of
rules for safety in our homes and communities.


Her mom said, “Without rules, the world would be hard to live
in. Just imagine if we didn’t have any rules while driving. That’s how
it was 100 years ago. It would be dangerous even to approach a car.
And what if people didn’t have to wear seatbelts?”


Frankie said, “So rules are just to keep yourself safe?” “It is also
about keeping other people safe,” said Mom. Mom. “If there is a car
accident, not only could the passengers be hurt, but police and rescue
workers helping to clear the accident could be at risk.”


Her mom continued, “It’s important to have fun, and rules help
us ensure everyone can have fun and stay safe at the same time.”


“I won’t disagree with that!” said Frankie.

like detectives. We’ll look for examples of rules in action!”

Once upon a time, in the small village of Booktown, there
was an adorable little library. One morning, the librarian,
Professor Pagemaster, opened the library and found that
a bookshelf had fallen over. The books were scattered
everywhere. Professor Pagemaster asked the children of
Booktown to help fix the shelves. After the children finished
the shelves, it was time to all of the
books. They noticed that some of the old book covers were
worn out. They decided to the covers
with new ones. Once the shelves were rebuilt, it was time to
all the adventure books to their rightful
places. The children also noticed that the walls of the
adventure section were scratched and faded. With Professor
Pagemaster’s approval, they decided to
the walls with vibrant colors to
match the excitement of the stories. With the library
fully            , it was time to open the doors and
allow all the library patrons to

Dear Family Member,



**Take-Home**



Your student has been practicing working with homophones
(words that sound the same but have different spellings
and different meanings). Please have your student use the
following activity for additional support. Solve the riddle by
using the secret code. The answer contains a homophone,
and the other part of the homophone pair is in parentheses.
Ask your student to explain the different meanings for
the two homophones in the pair, and how the riddle is
“playing” with the words. Encourage students to create their
own riddles or sentences throughout the week using the
code. Then, ask students to explain the meaning of each
homophone used.

##### **The Fox Rescue**


Dr. Chan was a veterinarian. He was passionate about helping
animals. He loved all animals, from rowdy rabbits to polite parrots.
Every day in Dr. Chan’s office was exciting; it was always filled with
happy barks and gentle purrs.


One afternoon, Dr. Chan received a phone call about a group of
kits in need of rescue in a nearby forest. The group of baby foxes had
climbed up a tree and were now stuck in a branch. Dr. Chan packed
his medical bag in a hurry. He set out to help the animals.


When Dr. Chan arrived in the forest, he saw the baby foxes
huddled together in the tree branch. They were struggling to climb
down from the tree. As they tried, they stepped on each other and
made a lot of noise. Dr. Chan carefully and gently helped each kit
down from the tree, placing them on the forest floor.


Dr. Chan decided to bring the baby foxes back to his office so he
could make sure they were healthy. He put them in a big cardboard
box in his car trunk. While he was driving, the foxes leaped out of the
box and crawled over the backseats. They turned Dr. Chan’s car into a
messy playground. They scattered dirt all around. They left tiny paw

amused. He laughed at the playful foxes.


Upon reaching his office, Dr. Chan made the kits feel safe as he

made sure they were healthy. After spending a little time in his office,
the kits were ready to return to their home.


From that day on, Dr. Chan would return to the forest to visit
the baby foxes. He always remembered rescuing them that day in the
forest.

##### **Forest Adventures**

one sentence at a time.


Once upon a time, in a sunny village, lived a cheerful team of
animals. There was a wise owl, a playful cat, and a brave dog. Every
day, they went on exciting adventures together. One day, they decided
to explore the deep forest.


The animals made their way through the tall trees. They
encountered a family of deer grazing peacefully. The animals watched
as the deer gracefully leaped through the green meadow.


Suddenly, they heard a sound nearby. It was a group of squirrels
playing hide-and-seek among the bushes. Their fluffy tails twitched.
The squirrels giggled and hopped around.


The owl hooted with delight. The cat purred happily. The dog
wagged its tail in excitement. Together, they continued their journey,
eager to explore more in the forest.


As the animals went deeper into the forest, they found a stream.
The water looked shiny in the sun and felt refreshing after a day of
exploring. The owl touched it with its claws. The cat tried to catch
the shiny spots. The dog played in the water, making it move.
