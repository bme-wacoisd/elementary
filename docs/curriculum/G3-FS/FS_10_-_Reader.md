**Chapter**
#### **The Instrument** **of Choice**
# **1**


A young boy named Sam lived on
Eighteenth Street in a neighborhood that was
lined with trees and cheerful houses . Sam was
eight years old and in the third grade . He had
a special love for music .


He would wake up to birds singing outside
his window every morning . He’d hum along,
matching their tunes . He enjoyed all kinds of
music and always came up with different songs .


Sam’s passion for music was as great as his
love for exploring new things . He knew music
was extraordinary, and that it could make
you feel happy, sad, or even take you on an
adventure without ever leaving home .

Sam often dreamed of creating beautiful
**melodies** on an instrument, but something
was missing . As much as he loved music, deep
down, he knew he needed to learn more .


Sam and his best friend, Ben, played catch
in Sam’s backyard one sunny afternoon .
Sam started humming “Take Me Out to the
Ballgame” to himself . Ben joined in .


“I think you have real music talent,”
Ben said .


Sam smiled . “Thanks, Ben . I wish I could
make real music, not just humming .”


Sam enjoyed the compliment . Music was
something that Sam loved to hear . Ben thought
momentarily and then said, “Why don’t you
try learning to play an instrument? If you did
that, you could make music!”



4


Sam’s eyes lit up with excitement . “That’s
a brilliant idea, Ben! But I don’t know which
instrument to pick, so I must consider it .”


Sam thought about all of the different
instruments he liked . He knew that learning
to play an instrument would be a fun way to
bring more **melodies** to life .


The next day, Sam and his mom got ready
for the mall . They jumped in the car and
started the drive .


“Mom, how much longer until we get to
the mall?” said Sam .


“We are only eighteen minutes away . Be
patient,” said Mom .

Sam listened to each musical note the
musician played and felt like the notes were
weightless .


Sam thought, “Wow, I would love to play
the piano .” At that moment, he knew what
instrument he wanted to learn to play . He
wanted to play melodies on the piano just like
the musician at the mall .


Sam gathered his family after dinner . He told
them he wanted to learn to play the piano . His
parents were thrilled with his choice, but they
reminded him that playing an instrument would
take time and practice .


His mom smiled and said, “I used to play the
piano when I was your age . I can teach you some
basics, and you can take lessons .”



8


Sam thought about it . He decided to
talk to his music teacher, Mrs . Anderson .
She and his mom could both help him
learn to play the piano .


He remembered that Mrs . Anderson
always played the piano in his music
class . He thought they could practice
there, too . He couldn’t wait to go to
school tomorrow to see Mrs . Anderson
and share the news .


Sam was on top of the world .
His journey into the world of music
had just begun . Sam couldn’t wait to
explore every melody, **harmony**, and all
the wonderful sounds the piano could
create .

Sam walked up to his teacher and told her
of his dream to learn how to play the piano .


Mrs . Anderson’s face lit up with a warm
smile . She agreed to help him and suggested
they begin their lessons at eight o’clock the
next day . She reminded him to ask his mom
first .


Sam sprinted home . Bursting with
excitement, he said, “Mom, guess what? Mrs .
Anderson said she could teach me to play the
piano! We’ll start with lessons tomorrow at
eight .” His mom was delighted, promising to
clean up their old piano for him to practice .


“That’s fantastic news! We’ll be ready for
Mrs . Anderson tomorrow . I’ll get the piano
ready for you,” she said with a smile .



12


13


“Thanks, Mom,” Sam replied, feeling grateful .
Sam’s mom and dad asked their neighbor, Mr . Kim,
to help them roll the piano out of the corner in the
family room . Dad pulled off the sheet that had kept
the piano safe all these years .


Sam helped by wiping away the dust . Mom
carefully polished the piano until it shone .


They took a step back once they finished
cleaning and both admired the piano . It was a
beautiful instrument . Sam’s mom gently tapped a
few keys to ensure the piano was in tune .


Mrs . Anderson arrived at eight o’clock, and
they got started . She explained the basics of the
instrument . She told him, “Sam, a piano has
eighty-eight keys . You can play high and low
notes by pressing these keys . Each key has a
different sound .”



14


Sam tried to take in all the information
while he stared at the piano . “Wow, that’s a lot
of keys! But I’m ready to learn,” Sam said .


They started with the middle C key in the
center of the piano . Mrs . Anderson showed
him where to place his fingers and the correct
**technique** to play the notes .


The two practiced a few simple tunes .
It was as thrilling as riding a sleigh down
a snowy hill . Sam wanted to wiggle with
excitement!


Mrs . Anderson pointed to a piece of sheet
music with what looked like a big “eight” at
the beginning, indicating the **rhythm** and
speed of the song .


Sam then realized that learning the piano
wasn’t just about loving music, playing the
keys, and reading the notes .



15


16


17


Learning to read sheet music was like
decoding a secret musical language . It was neat!


Finally, Mrs . Anderson said, “That’s
enough for today, Sam . Learning to play the
piano takes time and practice . But remember,
you’re on your way to creating beautiful
music, and I’m here to help you every step of
the way .”


It felt like their one-hour lesson had gone
by so fast . Sam had learned so much and
could not wait to learn more .


Mrs . Anderson started the next lesson
by showing Sam how to read musical notes .
She explained how the notes on the **treble**
**clef** and **bass clef** matched the piano keys .
Sam found distinguishing between the notes
**complex** . It was like a musical battle in his
mind, where the notes fought to get his
attention .



18


19


Mrs . Anderson explained that to read notes,
you need to follow the lines and spaces on the
staff . The notes are placed on different lines
and spaces . These notes tell you which key to
play on the piano .


Higher notes are found higher on the staff .
Lower notes are located lower on the staff .
You’ll find different notes on sheet music, each
with its own shape and position on the staff .


Sam nodded and took in all of this
information . He took notes as Mrs . Anderson
taught him, then began to play . At first, the
melody sounded more like a jumble of sounds
than a beautiful tune . Finding the right keys
proved to be quite a struggle . The notes just
refused to flow smoothly .


“I just don’t think I can read these notes and
play them at the same time,” said Sam .



20


“It’s okay, Sam . Learning the piano takes
time and practice . Remember, every musician
faces challenges at the beginning . Let’s take it
step by step,” said Mrs . Anderson .


They continued the lesson together . Mrs .
Anderson taught him that there are different
types of musical notes .


There is a whole note, half note, quarter
note, eighth note, and sixteenth note . Each
note looked different and had different beats .
Playing each of the notes would be more
complicated than Sam thought .


Sam sighed, doubting himself . He kept
wondering if he could ever play the piano like
he had dreamed .



21


22


23


“Mrs . Anderson, I still don’t know how to
read all these notes,” said Sam .


Mrs . Anderson gave him a kind smile . She
explained that many young musicians start
just like Sam, and reminded him that it is
**crucial** to keep trying and not give up . Sam
believed Mrs . Anderson when she said he
would get a little better every time .


Sam continued to practice with Mrs .
Anderson’s **guidance**, working through
each challenge one note at a time . He came
to realize that even minor changes in his
technique could make a big difference in the
music he played .



24


**Chapter**
#### **The Road to** **Rhythms**
# **2**


Sam arrived at Mrs . Anderson’s music room
for his piano lesson one day . He looked a bit
down, and his backpack felt heavier than usual . As
Sam sat down at the piano, he started coughing
nervously . He thought he might be getting sick .


Mrs . Anderson noticed something was
bothering him . She asked, “Sam, do you have
something on your mind?”


Sam sighed, and his voice sounded
troubled . “Mrs . Anderson, I’m not sure I can
do this . The music is too tough, and I don’t
think I’m improving . Maybe I should try a
different instrument . Maybe I am just not
good enough,” said Sam .



25


26


“Sam, learning to play any instrument can
be hard . But remember, with practice, you
can overcome these obstacles . I promise,” said
Mrs . Anderson .


Sam nodded, hoping that Mrs . Anderson
was right, although he wasn’t feeling so sure .


“Okay, Sam, let’s be thorough in what we
will practice today . Let’s get started,” said Mrs .
Anderson .


Sam was still worried about if would ever
be able to play the piano well . How long
would it take him to learn? When would
he be able to play his own music? What if
he didn’t like it anymore? He didn’t want to
disappoint anyone . He decided to continue to
focus on playing the piano .



27


28


When Sam struggled with a song, Mrs .
Anderson sat beside him and said, “Sam,
close your eyes, and imagine you’re at the
base of a tree . Learning the piano is like
climbing that tree . Each note you learn, and
each song you conquer takes you higher to
the top of that tree .”


Sam closed his eyes, and pictured the
tree in his mind . He felt calmer and more
determined as he played the song again .


“Let’s break it down . Remember, any time
you play music, take it step by step and note
by note,” said Mrs . Anderson .



29


30


31


Sam agreed, and with Mrs . Anderson’s
guidance, they practiced the song in smaller
parts . They broke up each piece and practiced
it one at a time . Sam practiced each part many
times .


Mrs . Anderson would count the **tempo**
and the beats . He grew tired but kept going
with Mrs . Anderson’s help . I can get through
this song little by little, he thought to himself .


Sam continued to practice the song
tirelessly . He learned to navigate the tricky
rhythms and **master** the tough parts . Slowly,
the song began to come together . Sam felt a
burst of happiness .



32


He turned to Mrs . Anderson with a big smile
and said, “I never thought I could do it, Mrs .
Anderson . I wanted to give up, but you helped me
through it . I realize now that I must keep going
when things get rough .”


Sam felt so proud of himself as he left the
lesson that day . He noticed something amazing
start to happen as the weeks passed: Playing music
felt more and more natural .




Sam began to look and sound like a real
musician . He even started to watch videos
of professional musicians to see how they
performed . Sam wanted to be just like those
musicians and be confident in himself . He was
learning that success came to those who never
gave up, no matter how hard the struggle .



34


As Sam headed toward his classroom a few
weeks later, he spotted a colorful sign in the
hallway that read “First **Annual** Talent Show .”


The loudspeaker came on . “Good morning,
students . This is Dr . Sandberg, and these are the
morning announcements . This month, we will
host our first talent show . Tryouts will take place
on November 4 at 9:00 a .m . The show will take
place at 1850 SW 90th Ave . Everyone is welcome
to participate . Teachers will pass out flyers today
in your homeroom . Teachers, make sure to pass
these out ASAP .”


Everybody started whispering to each other .
Sam’s heart raced at the thought of being able
to **showcase** his piano skills . He wondered if he
should join the talent show .



35


36


**Chapter**
#### **Sam’s Grand** **Performance**
# **3**


Sam went to Mrs . Anderson’s music room
the following day . When he reached her room,
he found Mrs . Anderson tuning a violin .


Sam cleared his throat and asked Mrs .
Anderson if she thought he should participate
in the talent show .


Mrs . Anderson put the violin aside and
gave Sam her full attention . “Sam, that’s
wonderful news! It’s a fantastic opportunity to
showcase your talent .”


Sam fiddled with his backpack strap,
his thoughts racing like a speeding train .
“But what if I make a mistake in front of
everyone?” he asked .



37


38


39


Mrs . Anderson smiled kindly at Sam,
recognizing his hesitation . “It’s natural to have
those thoughts . Even professional musicians
get nervous sometimes . But remember, it’s
not about being perfect . It’s about sharing
your love for music with others and doing
something you enjoy . I do not doubt that you
can do it .”


Sam felt a sense of determination growing
within him . The decision was challenging . He
knew it was time to take a leap and try out for
the talent show .



40


Saturday morning finally arrived . It was
the day of the school talent show tryouts . Sam
woke up with excitement and nerves swirling
in his belly .


Sam hopped in the car with Dad and
headed toward school .


Students of all ages gathered for the
tryouts . Sam watched kids perform magic
tricks, sing their hearts out, and do funny
stand-up comedy routines . They were all so
well prepared . He wondered if he would stand
out and earn a spot in the show .


Sam noticed four groups . Each group was
labeled North, East, South, and West .


“Mrs . Anderson, where should I go?” asked
Sam . “You are in group West,” said Mrs .
Anderson .



41


42


43


Sam got into his group and waited his
turn . When his turn finally came, Sam took a
deep breath and stepped onto the stage .


He sat at the piano, started playing, and
let his music fill the room . He was shocked
to hear applause at the end . He hoped that
meant that they liked his audition .


Sam asked Mrs . Anderson when he would
find out if he had made the talent show . Mrs .
Anderson told him the list would be posted
the next week .


Sam checked the bulletin board nonstop
in the school hallway . Days passed, and
Sam grew impatient . The wait felt almost
impossible . He hoped the music teachers
would not be **indecisive** because he couldn’t
wait to see the final list .



44


Finally, the day came . He saw a crowd
gathered around the bulletin board . Sam
joined the group as his heart pounded with
anticipation . He saw the list posted on the
board, and he was about to find out if his
name was on it .


Right there, in the middle of the list, was
Sam’s name: “Sam – Piano Performance .” He
couldn’t believe it! He had made it! A rush of
joy washed over him .



45


46


Sam knew he wanted to make an **impact** at
the show . Even though he felt a bit **insecure**
about how to do that, something inside told
him he could .


He quickly ran to Mrs . Anderson . “Mrs .
Anderson! Mrs . Anderson! I’m in! I’m in!”
shouted Sam .


“That’s wonderful news, Sam,” said Mrs .
Anderson .


They both shared the same sense of disbelief
that the show was approaching so quickly . It
was just a few weeks away, so it was time to
decide on the perfect piece for Sam to play .


“Now, I hope this is not **inconvenient**, but
we need to think about what song you want
to perform,” said Mrs . Anderson .



47


48


49


“Thanks, Mrs . Anderson . I will think about
it some more . See you tomorrow at my lesson!”
said Sam . Sam felt proud of all his hard work .


Mrs . Anderson knew that choosing the
right song was crucial . She wanted it to be an
immediate hit for the crowd . It should capture
everyone’s attention from the very first note .


Sam felt a bit of discomfort mixed with
excitement . He had many songs to choose
from . Some were **classic** and timeless, while
others were more modern and upbeat . Sam
knew that while he wanted the song to be
perfect, even great musicians are sometimes
imperfect .



50


51


They eventually discovered a beautiful
piece that felt just right .


He practiced every day and could tell he
was making improvements . Complex notes
became easier . He was bringing the song to
life . Sam turned an incomplete piece into a
beautiful **masterpiece** .


It was the day of the big talent show .
He was feeling a mix of happiness and
nervousness . His heart drummed in his chest .


“You’re going to do great, Sam,” his parents
said with joyful faces . “Just be yourself and
play your best .”



52


53


Sam grabbed his backpack and headed out
the door . The day was a bit rainy, with soft
drops of water falling from the sky . It was not
a good sign .


**Anticipation** washed over him as he
entered the auditorium . Sam saw students,
families, and teachers filling the space and
a beautifully decorated stage with colorful
curtains and bright lights . Sam looked around
and tried to predict how performing in front
of so many people would feel .


He spotted his teacher, Mrs . Anderson,
sitting in the front row . Sam felt relief and
walked over to her .


“Mrs . Anderson,” he said with a nervous
smile, “I’m starting to feel a bit funny, like I
have butterflies in my stomach .”



54


Mrs . Anderson giggled, her voice full of
softness and warmth .


“Sam, it’s perfectly normal to feel this way .
Every performer gets a little nervous before
going on stage . Remember, you’ve prepared
for this . I do not doubt that you’re going to
do well . Just breathe and enjoy the moment,”
said Mrs . Anderson .


Sam took a deep breath and felt a little
better . He knew Mrs . Anderson was right .
He watched as other students performed
their acts . Some acts were funny, making
the audience burst into laughter . Others
were beautiful, evoking tears of happiness .
Everyone was so talented .



55


56


57


Sam sat down in front of the piano, took
a deep breath, and started to play . Sam’s
nervousness faded away with the first notes
of his piece . He allowed the music to tell his
story .


Sam’s face displayed a mix of concentration
and happiness . His eyes stayed on the music
sheet and the notes before him . While
playing, he tapped the piano’s pedals with his
feet .


Sam felt like he had transformed from
being terrified to feeling fearless . Sam
continued to play, and although he made a
mistake or two, he kept going . He hoped no
one would notice . As he reached the song’s
end, he could feel everyone’s eyes on him .



58


Sam played his final notes, and there was
a moment of silence . Suddenly, the audience
erupted with noise . Everyone clapped and
cheered .


Sam’s heart swelled with emotion as he
took a bow . He was on cloud nine . He had
played his first performance, but at that
moment, he realized it would not be his last .


“Great job, Sam! Congrats, Sam!” shouted
his friends and family .


“Bravo! Bravo!” shouted Mrs . Anderson .



59


60


61


His best friend, Ben, was the first to give him
a high five as he came off the stage . “Sam, that
was incredible! It seemed like it was a piece of
cake for you .”


Sam’s parents, standing close by, quickly
embraced him . His dad said, “Son, you’ve come
a long way since you first started learning to play .
It’s been such a great learning experience for you .
We are both so proud of you .”


Mom suggested, “How about we celebrate
with some ice cream?”


Sam’s eyes lit up . “Ice cream sounds perfect!
Let’s do it .”

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully leveled
in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.

The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many spellings
can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to make early
reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of the available
spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out as part of their
phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been deliberately
introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if they are
assigned at the proper time.

As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.


TRICKY WORDS:


brilliant, journey, technique, rhythm, language, distinguishing, doubting, conquer, natural,
annual, routines


**Code Knowledge added gradually in the unit for this Reader:**


  - Decode multisyllabic words with final stable syllables _–ble_, _–tle_, _–gle_ .

  - Identify the meaning of words with affixes ( _im–_, _non–_, _dis–_, _in–_ ).

  - Decode multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns for _eigh_ .

  - Decode multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns for _ough_ .
