### **Chapter The Importance of** **Sound in Daily Life**
# **1**

One Thursday morning, Marcus and Cory
were walking to school and talking about
Marcus’s birthday party that was coming soon.


“Do you think it will be loud with
everyone talking and playing games?”
Cory asked.


“Yes! But it will be fun and interesting,”
Marcus replied with a smile.



1


2


As they turned, there was a loud car beep
and a hiss of tires on wet pavement. A large
puddle of water was on the road. A car sped by,
and the water went squirting onto the sidewalk.


“Wow, that was a surprise! But isn’t it cool
how we could hear the car before we saw it?”
Marcus said.


“Yes, you are right,” Cory said as he nodded.


Cory and Marcus kept walking and
listening to the sounds around them. Dogs
were barking, and leaves were rustling in the
breeze. It was like a concert.



3


“Every sound happens for a reason,” Cory
said. “For example, the barking dog might
have seen a squirrel.”


Marcus agreed. “It’s important to listen.
Sounds can tell us things without seeing
them. I can hear someone turning the corner
because of their footsteps.”


As they were talking, they didn’t realize
they had disturbed Mrs. Jenkins, who was out
for a walk. “Boys, please use a softer voice.
Remember, voices carry in this quiet town!”


“Sorry, Mrs. Jenkins!” they both said,
understanding the power of their voices.

6


Children were talking, a whistle blew, and the
bell rang, **signaling** the start of the school day.
It was another type of music to their ears. They
finally got close enough to see the school.


Marcus thought about his party again. “I hope
the music at my party makes everyone happy. I
want it to be a day no one will forget.”


Cory smiled. “With your taste in music, I’m
sure it will be a hit. Can’t wait for it, buddy!”


The boys entered the school ready to return to
the classroom, where the only sound for the next
hour would be the teacher’s soft voice reading
them a story.



7


The school day passed quickly, and soon
it was time for music class, Marcus’s favorite.
Today, they were learning about different
instruments and how each made its sound. Mrs.
Lopez, their teacher, explained how the **vibration**
of strings on a guitar or the air through a flute
creates different tones.


Marcus and Cory were both eager to try.
Marcus picked up a guitar and gently turned
the pegs to tune it before strumming the strings.
The sound was a warm, rich melody that made
everyone stop and listen. Cory chose the flute,
and with a burst of air, he created a soft, highpitched tune.



8


9


Their classmates clapped, and Mrs. Lopez had
a big smile. “You see when something vibrates,
it makes a sound. And those vibrations travel
through the air to reach your ears.” The boys
were amazed to learn how unique sounds are.
They decided to find out more.



10


11


12


Marcus and Cory planned to listen to sounds
in different places in town after school. They
found many sounds over the next few days. They
heard the tap, tap of water dripping, a laptop’s
low buzz, and people talking. On Saturday,
they went to the park. A band was there to play
music. Marcus and Cory sat on the grass and
watched. The drummer hit his drums and made
a beat that got people tapping their feet. When
the music started, the boys felt it all around
them. It was a big moment. The boys understood
how sounds can bring people together and make
them happy. They decided to go to the park
every Saturday to enjoy the music.



13


**Chapter**
### **Producing Sound**
# **2**

After learning about sounds, Marcus and
Cory were excited to have a new adventure.
They were going to a garden party this
weekend and knew there would be lots of
sounds to hear.


“The music artist at the party is named
Martha, and she is known for her great
tunes,” said Marcus, his eyes shining.


“I’m excited to see how she uses sound in
her songs,” said Cory.



14


15


16


The boys loved the music at the party. They
saw how the singer played different guitar
strings to change the tune. The music stood
out, even with the noise of the people, making
a peaceful space in the garden.


When the music stopped, they asked the
singer, “How do you make such cool sounds?”


She smiled and said, “You must know your
guitar and how sound works. How the strings
shake, the guitar’s shape, and how you hit the
strings to change the sound. You have to know
how notes work and how to read music. It all
matters.”


Hearing her talk about music filled the boys
with wonder.



17


The party had many sounds, like talking
and glasses clinking. They saw lanterns light
up the singer’s face as they walked through the
garden.


Seeing their interest, Martha invited
them to learn more about sound with her.
She showed them how each part of her
guitar made the beautiful music that filled the
garden. She talked with such joy about her
music. The boys’ minds were buzzing! It was
like a **spectacular** carnival of sounds
and music.


Marcus and Cory felt inspired by the
night, the smell of flowers, and the thrill of
new ideas. They planned to make musical
instruments when they got home.



18


19


20


Days later, they sat in Marcus’s yard with
their homemade instruments. Marcus made a
drum from a pot and rubber bands, and Cory
made a flute from a pipe with some holes.


They were like musical artists, trying to
understand sound. They smiled when the
music didn’t sound right and kept trying. It
was all part of their musical adventure.



21


**Chapter**
### **How People Hear**
# **3**

Marcus and Cory went to the library to
learn about hearing. They saw a big ear model
in the library’s science corner. The librarian
showed them how the ear works. They
learned how forces make sound waves travel
through the air. Then, sound enters a person’s
ears, making the eardrum vibrate.


A special machine taught them about the
inside of the ear. They listened to different
sounds and saw how amazing their ears were.


“I can’t believe how many sounds our ears
can hear,” Cory said.



22


23


24


“Yes, our ears catch all the sounds
around us. We can’t afford to forget to protect
them,” Marcus agreed, impressed.


The next day, they were going to a concert
and a sporting event, so they ordered special
headphones to protect their ears from the
loud noises.


“It’s important to take care of our ears and
not hear loud sounds for too long,” said Cory
on their way to the concert.


“Yes, some places use soft walls to **absorb**
sound so it’s not too loud. These walls are on
the border of the room,” Marcus added.


“But I don’t think the concert or game will
have those walls,” Cory said.



25


At the concert, they used their headphones.
They still enjoyed the music without hurting
their ears. The concert was full of loud music.
Cory and Marcus felt the music move through
them, even with their headphones.


They talked afterward about how the
headphones helped support their hearing.
They giggled as they recalled that the
performer wore a shiny suit that looked like
armor. They had a lot of fun.



26


27


**Chapter**
### **Sounds Outdoors**
# **4**

One day, Cory and Marcus decided to
explore the great outdoors. They wanted to
enjoy some quiet time in nature and listen
for the sounds they might hear there. There
was a chill in the air. The sky was cloudy, and
the air felt icy as they started their trip. They
wore their cozy jackets because the weather
report said it might get misty and snowy.


They walked through the forest along the
dusty path. “It’s kind of gloomy today, isn’t
it?” Marcus said.



28


29


Cory nodded, pushing his hands deep in
his pockets to stay warm. “Yes, but it’s exciting!
Every step feels like we’re in a new world.” The
boys commented on the unique sounds they
heard, like the crunching of the dirty dried
leaves under their shoes and the sound of the
water in a small stream.


Suddenly, they heard a splash! Their hearts
jumped at the **startling** sound. It was only a
frog hopping into the stream, leaving circles in
the water where it landed.


They laughed and were feeling a bit thirsty
after their long walk. Luckily, Cory had
brought a bottle of water. As they sat on a
log, they heard the world around them. It was
noisy, with birds chirping and the wind playing
through the branches.


“Windy, isn’t it?” Marcus said, his hair a
mess from the **gusts** .



30


31


32


“Yes, but it will be sunny soon!” Cory
smiled, pointing at the sky where the sun was
peeking through the clouds.


Their trip was far from over, and they
could not wait to see what else they would
discover on that fun day. The world was
full of surprises. They were ready for all the
wonders ahead.



33


### **Chapter The Importance of** **Light in Daily Life**
# **5**

One night, Marcus and Cory were
thinking about light.


“Light can be helpful but also **dangerous**,”
said Marcus. “The sun helps plants to grow,
but staring at the sun is bad for our eyes.”


“Yes, we can wear sunglasses to protect
our eyes from the sun’s light. Also, we can
get sunburn from staying too long in the
bright sun. That’s why wearing sunscreen is
important,” said Cory.



34


They thought about other kinds of light, like
the signs that lit their town and the bright lights
used by firefighters to see in the dark.



35


36


The next day, Cory and Marcus
went to a science center. There was
a light display with quiet, melodic
music. The boys learned light sources
can be natural or constructed by
people. For example, the sun is a
natural light source. A light bulb,
however, may make light, but it is
machine-made. They learned that
light is the only form of energy seen
with our eyes and that we can see
rainbows because light from the sun
shines through water droplets.


The boys also learned that it is
important to protect our eyes from
blue light from computer screens and
ultraviolet light from the sun.



37


They looked up at the sky and saw the light
from the stars.


“We should be cautious with light, but it can
be pretty too,” Cory said.


Cory and Marcus discussed holiday lights and
played with light beams and colored glass.


They remembered the special lights used
in shows. They also learned about the glorious
northern lights and fireflies.



38


39


**Chapter**
### **Colors and Light**
# **6**

“Colors have many purposes, right?”
Marcus wondered aloud.


“Yeah, like how traffic lights tell us when
to be cautious,” Cory answered.


Marcus and Cory looked around at
different colors and then looked for rainbows.


“Let’s try making a rainbow,” Marcus said.
They sprayed water from a hose into the
sunlight and saw a rainbow form.



40


41


“It happens because the light breaks apart,”
Cory said.


They noticed another rainbow form as light
shined through a clear glass.


With their homemade **prism**, they looked
at how a beam of light could split into
various colors.


They visited an art store with **gorgeous**
paintings. The boys were amazed by the colors
in each painting. Different shades of light
shone on the paintings, making the colors
come alive and change. It was as if the colors
could tell a story.


“Being able to identify all the different
colors that exist is an enormous task,” joked
Marcus as they looked at the different
paintings.



42


43


44


Their next stop was a flower garden with
numerous and **vibrant** colors. They spent the
afternoon watching the changing colors of the
sunset.


“It’s amazing how light and color are
connected,” Cory said as the sky turned into a
marvelous mix of colors.


They watched how colors blended, forming a
continuous spread.


Their quest for colors led them to an artist’s
workshop. They saw her making beautiful
paintings.



45


46


“Colors are like music for the eyes,” the artist
said, mixing her paints.


They saw blue and red merge into a gorgeous
purple. The artist taught them the color wheel
and how some colors go well together.


“The color of something depends on which
waves of light it reflects,” she explained, using
green paint.


Not surprisingly, the boys wanted to try
painting. They learned the meticulous balance
needed to mix colors right. Their first tries were
humorous and led to some messy results.


“We should make a color wheel,” Cory said.



47


They painted a paper plate with different
colors. It was a rigorous task, needing careful
work to mix the paints correctly.


Marcus and Cory talked about the uses of
colors as they painted.


“Green for ‘go’ on traffic lights,” said Marcus.


“And red as an alert, like for stop signs,”
added Cory.


They admired their completed color wheel. It
was a continuous circle of marvelous colors.


Before cleaning up, Marcus had an idea.


“Let’s add black and white to see the effect on
the colors.”


The boys mixed black paint into a part of the
blue paint to turn it dark navy like the night sky.
Then they mixed white paint into a part of the
red paint to create a rosy pink.



48


“It all starts with light,” Cory said.


“Yep, light is continuous, just like color,”
Marcus replied.


“Without light, we couldn’t see any of this.”



49


**Chapter**
### **How the Eye Works**
# **7**

After seeing all of the vibrant colors and
light in the world around them, Marcus and
Cory wanted to learn more about how the eye
works. They decided to go back to the local
science center to see the exhibit on the eye.
They planned their visit **thoughtfully** and
arrived early to beat the crowds.


“Let’s check out the human eye section,”
Marcus said.


Cory agreed happily and led the way.


A friendly guide welcomed them to
the exhibit.



50


51


52


She showed them a big model of an eye and
eagerly told them how light enters the eye and
passes through a **lens** .


“The eye can focus automatically. That
helps us see clearly,” she explained. She moved
her hands softly over the different parts of the
eye model.


Marcus and Cory listened attentively. They
moved closer to the model and examined it
curiously.


“Notice how the black dot gets bigger
and smaller,” the guide said, pointing to the
model’s **pupil** .



53


“It’s **reacting** to light instantly, just like our
eyes do,” Cory said.


They saw an interesting display with glasses,
and they got to try on glasses that showed
different eye conditions. They quickly understood
how glasses helped people see. The guide
explained some people need glasses to see clearly.


“People also have an amazing ability to see
things beside them without turning their heads.
This is called seeing peripherally,” the guide said.



54


55


56


The boys were surprised at how much they
could see without looking directly at something.


They tried to surprise each other from the
side, but their side vision saw the movement.


Cory and Marcus sat tiredly on a bench as
their visit ended. They were thinking about all
the information they learned.


“Our eyes are amazing,” Marcus said as he
looked around the museum.


“Yes, they work flawlessly to give us amazing
vision,” Cory added.


Both boys felt thankful their eyes allowed
them to see the world.



57


### **Chapter How Magnifying** **Glasses Work**
# **8**

One afternoon, Marcus and Cory eagerly
set out to understand **magnification** . They
carefully laid out their magnifying glasses on
the wooden table in the backyard. The sun
was shining brightly above them.


“Let’s look at things closely, like real
scientists,” said Marcus, his eyes sparkling
excitedly.


“Absolutely,” agreed Cory as he picked up a
magnifying glass and carefully examined a leaf.


The boys looked at many objects,
observing each one individually. They moved
slowly and made sure they got all the details.



58


Then, they shared their **findings** .



59


60


“Did you notice how smoothly the ants are
moving?” Cory asked, focusing the lens on a
line of ants marching on the ground.


“Yes, and when I look at them through the
glass, they seem to be moving more quickly,”
Marcus replied as he watched the tiny ants
with interest. They kept looking for exciting
things to see under a magnifying glass.


The boys made a map of their
**observations**, neatly noting each discovery.
They focused intently as they recorded the
information they saw.


“Look at this flower,” Marcus said suddenly,
holding a daisy under the lens. “The petals
look so smooth, and the center is bumpy with
pollen.” Cory peered over curiously.



61


They looked at flashlight beams through the
magnifying glasses when it got dark. The beams
passed through the lenses and created a brightly
lit circle.


“This is so cool,” Cory said. “The light spreads
out evenly and makes everything look so clear.”


“You’re right,” Marcus replied, moving the
lens slightly. “The magnifying glass enlarges and
sharpens the image.”


Cory and Marcus kept exploring until the
stars twinkled softly in the night sky. Soon, they
realized time had passed surprisingly quickly.


Finally, they sat the magnifying glasses on the
table and chatted about the day. It had been full
of discovery with their magnifying glasses.



62


63


**Chapter**
### **Night Vision**
# **9**

After learning about how the eye works,
Cory and Marcus thought about nocturnal
animals and their activity at night. They
thought of how owls have impressive night
vision, having a reflective layer in their eyes
that makes them effective hunters.


The boys’ parents planned a night walk in
the woods so they could see and learn more
about nocturnal animals. They saw how
bright some animals’ eyes looked when light
shone on them.



64


65


66


The boys learned about how the responsive
nature of some animals’ eyes allowed them to
navigate in the dark.


This **spurred** Marcus and Cory to think
about night vision for humans, too. One night,
their active minds were eager to figure out how
night vision works. They began an investigative
quest to learn how people could see in the
dark.


“Night vision is like a magic trick,”
said Marcus.


“Yes, it turns night into day!” Cory added.


“Our eyes don’t see like that,” Marcus said.



67


“But it’s still fun to pretend,” Cory said with
a smile. Since they didn’t have real night-vision
goggles, they were creative. They made pretend
night-vision goggles. They played in the yard,
acting like they could see objects in the dark.


Marcus and Cory wanted to learn more,
so they began a comprehensive search on how
night-vision equipment worked. They checked
out books at the library to learn about the
impressive **technology** . The devices use small
amounts of light to make things that are in the
dark visible.


“This technology is so amazing,” Marcus said.
“It’s like having superpowers!”


“It is incredible,” Cory added, thinking of
how night vision could be helpful and adaptive.


Marcus and Cory felt excited about all the
new things they learned about night vision.



68


69


**Chapter**
### **Fun with Flashlights** **and Shadows**
# **10**

Marcus and Cory were feeling very
inventive the next day. They wanted to
learn more about light and shadows.
They transformed their backyard into an
**imaginative** stage. The boys were ready for an
active evening of fun with their flashlights.


“Let’s see who can make the most creative
shadow,” Marcus challenged.



70


71


72


“I’m on it!” Cory replied. They started
with simple shapes. They moved their hands
expressively to form animals and objects. The
boys’ shadow play became more inventive.
They used other items to cast silhouettes. Then
they discovered shadows were sharpest when
the light source was directly behind the object.


“My action figure looks massive when I put
it close to the light,” Marcus said. He held his
toy close to the light, making its shadow grow
large on the wall.


“And when I move it away, it becomes tiny,”
Cory said in amazement.


The boys invented a game in which they
tried to guess the object just by its shadow.
It was surprisingly hard. The shadows were
**deceptive** . It took many creative guesses to get
them right.



73


As they played, they began to tell a story with
their shadows. Marcus’s shadow was a protective
knight, and Cory’s was a dragon. As they moved
their flashlights, the shadows seemed to come
alive. “The dragon’s shadow looks so scary!”
exclaimed Cory. His hands made the dragon’s
shadow flap its wings **aggressively** .


“The knight’s shadow is brave,” Marcus said,
moving his action figure to make the knight’s
shadow stand firm.


The boys made quite a show with the shadows
on the wall. They learned how to change the
angle of the light to make the shadows look more
active or **passive**, depending on how they wanted
the story to go.



74


75


76


Marcus and Cory took turns making their
story more imaginative. At one point, they even
used a fan to make the shadows flicker and move.


They decided to make a big ending for their
shadow play. They used all the objects they had
to cast a massive shadow of all the toys together.


Cory nodded, the flashlight in his hand
casting a warm glow on his face. “They look
like they’re all gathering together for a big
party.” With that, they turned off the flashlights,
allowing the shadows to fade into the night.



77


**Chapter**
### **Lights and Sounds at** **the Amusement Park**
# **11**

Marcus and Cory’s next adventure took
them to a place where lights and sounds were
all around. They went to the local amusement
park! The park was full of excited visitors. The
air was buzzing with the sounds of laughter
and music. The boys stood at the entrance,
looking forward to the fun times ahead.


The flashing lights of the rides and the
colorful game booths greeted the boys. The
sun was coloring the sky with its evening light.



78


The contrast between the park’s lights and
the darkening sky added a magical glow.



79


80


“Look at the Ferris wheel!” Cory shouted. It
had flashing lights that seemed to brighten and
flatten against the sky as it spun.


Marcus pointed to the roller coaster. “Check
out how the lights make it look even faster as
it twists and turns!” He was **entranced** by the
exciting scene.


They thought taking notes on the different
lights and sounds they **encountered** would
be good. They saw the soft golden glow of the
carousel. They heard the engines on the other rides.


The boys enjoyed the hundreds of different
sounds in the park. They thought the noises
could be entertaining but too loud at times.



81


They found a game booth with a ring toss in a
quiet park area. The attendant explained how to
play and made sure to address all the rules. The
rings clinked against the bottles. It was very hard
to land the rings on the necks of the bottles. The
game required athletic skill. The sounds and soft
lights of the game enveloped the players in a cozy
bubble away from the rest of the park.


Marcus and Cory’s favorite area was the
haunted house. Flickering lights cast strange
shadows on the walls, and hidden speakers made
scary sounds.


As they exited the haunted house, the boys
were surprised by a sudden burst of music from
a nearby stage where a live band was setting up.
The sound check sent vibrations through the air.



82


“This is the best mix of lights and
sounds!” Marcus said with excitement.



83


84


Cory agreed, “It’s like the whole park is alive!”


“Look at the Ferris wheel now!” Marcus said.
The ride lit up the evening sky. “It brightens the
sky with so many colors!”


Cory’s eyes were **gleaming** with excitement.
“And listen to the music!”


They walked through the park. Their steps
quickened as they got close to more fun games
and rides.


Marcus and Cory were hungry, so they
decided to go to the amusement park’s food
court. There were many choices of things to eat.
Marcus decided to get a sandwich and a candy
apple. Cory chose a piece of pumpkin pie.



85


“Let’s take a ride on the carousel,” offered
Cory. As they ran toward the beautiful ride, the
lights softened.


As they rode on the painted horses, the
music from the ride blended with the sounds
around them. The boys felt like they were part
of an **enchanting** story, the heroes of their own
adventure.


Marcus and Cory were drawn in next by a
game where they had to knock down stacks of
cans with beanbags. Each good throw caused a
loud clang that sweetened the victory.


“Nice shot!” Marcus cheered as Cory’s throw
sent the cans tumbling down.



86


87


88


They ended their visit with a ride on the
bumper cars. The ride had bright lights and
energetic music. The boys laughed as they drove
their cars, the crashes softened by the rubber
bumpers. The night ended with a dazzling
fireworks display. The sky was dark and then
suddenly brightened by the explosive lights.
The fireworks strengthened the bond between
Marcus and Cory as they stood together
watching the display.


“It’s been an amazing day,” Marcus said
happily.


“I couldn’t agree more!” Cory replied, as his
smile widened.


The sights and sounds of the amusement
park were all around as they enjoyed the
fireworks display.

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully leveled
in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.

The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many spellings
can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to make early
reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of the available
spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out as part of their
phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been deliberately
introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if they are
assigned at the proper time.

As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.

carousel, figure, guitar, silhouettes, sorry
