**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 7. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. Teachers will explain these activity
pages to the students orally, using the instructions in the Teacher Guide. There are also instructions
on the activity pages for students to read themselves. The Activity Book is a student component,
which means each student should have an Activity Book.

###### **Fluency Assessment**

Read aloud the txext below.

###### **Maya and the Monster**


Once upon a time, there was a big hill in a faraway land. There
was a village at the bottom of the hill. There was a monstrous creature
who lived in a tower at the top of the hill. The villagers were afraid of
the monster. They never went up the hill.


One day, a kind and brave girl named Maya, who lived in the
village, wanted to learn more about the mysterious creature. She had
heard awful stories, but she believed that maybe the monster wasn’t
mean. Maybe he was just lonely.


Maya set off on an adventure up the hill without telling anyone
in the village. As she climbed higher, the air became thinner, and the
wind whispered. However, Maya kept going. She really wanted to
show kindness to the monster.


When she reached the top of the hill, she was surprised. She didn’t
see a scary monster at all. He was a furry creature with big, kind eyes.
He looked weak and sad. The monster was surprised to see Maya.


Maya smiled and said, “I came here to be your friend. I don’t want
you to be lonely anymore.”


Foundational Skills 7

**36**



The monster was grateful for Maya’s kindness. He explained that
when the villagers saw him prowling around the tower and the hill,
he was only looking for food. He did not want to hurt anyone.


Maya and the monster became friends. Now the monster
wasn’t lonely anymore. Maya returned to the village and explained
to everyone about the monster. The villagers realized that some
things that seem awful aren’t so bad. They are just misunderstood.
The villagers joined Maya and the monster in spreading kindness.
From that day on, the village and the hill were filled with love and
friendship.
