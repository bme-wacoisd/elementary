**Lesson 13: VC/V Syllable Pattern** **Digital Component 13.1**

# **VC/V Syllable Pattern**


VC/V Syllable Pattern


       - The word has a syllable that ends with a consonant
(closed syllable).


       - The closed syllable creates a short vowel sound.


       - The word’s syllables are divided after the consonant.


         - Example: punish; pun/ish


          - valid


         - robin


         - lavish


         - vanish


Foundational Skills 1 Digital Components 8


**Lesson 14: VCCCV Syllable Pattern** **Digital Component 14.1**


**VCCCV Syllable Pattern**


When a word contains two single vowel sounds separated by
three consonants, separate the syllables after the first single
consonant unless the first two consonants function as a
blend or digraph.


Steps to Syllabicate:


                - Label each vowel sound with a ‘V’.


               - Label each consonant between the vowel sounds with
a ‘C’.


                - Identify and underline a digraph or blend (if present).


                 - Split the syllable after the fi rst single consonant or
consonant blend/digraph.













|VC/CCV (split after the first<br>consonant)|VCC/CV (split after the first<br>two consonants)|
|---|---|
|h u n / d r e d<br>    V  C     C C  V|k i n g / d o m<br>   V C  C     C  V|
|kitchen|mushroom|
|children|pumpkin|

     - Label each consonant between the vowel
sounds with a ‘C’.


     - Identify and underline a digraph or blend (if
present).


  - Identify the VCCV, VCV, or VCCCV syllable patterns
and follow the rules on this page to divide the
syllables.
