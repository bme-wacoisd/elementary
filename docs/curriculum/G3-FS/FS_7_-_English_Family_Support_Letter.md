# **Welcome!**
### **Grade 3, Unit 7**
## **Foundational Skills**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will learn about diphthongs, homophones, homographs, and other suffixes, such
as _–able_ and _–ible_, as well as using suffixes to determine the meaning of a word.


**What will my student learn?**


Students will be introduced to the diphthongs _aw_, _ou_, and _oi_ . Students will identify, use, and explain
the meaning of homographs and will practice spelling homophones. They will also learn suffixes, such
as _–able_ and _–ible_, along with how suffixes change the meanings of base words. Students will practice
reading with the Reader, _Everyday Heroes_ . This Reader has stories about heroes in our communities,
such as paramedics, firefighters, and police officers, that play an important part in keeping us safe.


**Additional Practice**

Students can practice these words each night by doing the following activities:

1. **Word Association:** Ask your student to think of other words related to the Tricky and

High-Frequency Words. This will help reinforce their understanding of each word’s
meaning and usage.

Students can practice these words each night by doing the following activities:

1. **Word Challenges:** Challenge your student to find words with the focus spelling patterns in

books, in magazines, or around the house. When they identify a word, discuss its spelling
and meaning.

2. **Drawing and Writing:** Invite your student to write a sentence using the focus spelling

patterns and then to draw a picture to match their sentence.
