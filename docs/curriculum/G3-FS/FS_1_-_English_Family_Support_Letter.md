# **Welcome!**
## **Grade 3, Unit 1** **Foundational Skills**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will review skills taught in Grade 2, including digraphs and trigraphs. Students will also be

assessed to ensure appropriate level of instruction.


**What** **will** **my** **student** **learn?**

Students will review common consonant digraphs, such as _wh_, _sh_, _th_, _ng_, _nk_, _ck_, _ch_, _ge_, _ph_, and _gh_, and trigraphs, such as

_tch_, _igh_, _ear_, _eer_, _ere_, _ore_, and _dge_ . The Reader for this unit is _Campfire_ _Tales_, which tells the story of a group of

Friday-night campers sharing stories around the campfire. Each story carries a moral lesson, fostering values such as

kindness, respect, and bravery. In Grade 3, students are expected to write neatly in cursive, using correct letter

formation and leaving space between words.

magazines, or around the house. When they identify a word, discuss its spelling and meaning.

draw a picture to match their sentence.
