**Grade 3 | Foundational Skills 10**
Introduction


~~**UNIT 10 OVERVIEW**~~


This unit focuses on several skills that will give students the tools to decode unfamiliar words. Skills
include new spelling patterns, affixes, and final stable syllables, as well as abbreviations, compound
words, and idioms.


Unit 10 introduces the new spelling patterns _eigh_ and _ough_ . Teaching students spelling patterns
gives them the tools they need when encountering new words, rather than just allowing them to
memorize single words. They can transfer their knowledge of a pattern to new words they have not
seen before but that contain that pattern.


Similarly, the instruction on final stable syllables and compound words helps students understand
how to break longer words into manageable parts. It allows them to read longer words more
accurately and fluently, can help to build their confidence as readers, and gives them a strategy for
attacking longer, more challenging words.


Students review affixes and learn new ones, such as _im‒, in‒,_ and _pre‒_ . Affixes modify the meanings
of base words; this knowledge is fundamental in word formation and vocabulary expansion, allowing
for more precise language use and better comprehension of complex texts.


Unit 10 introduces abbreviations and idioms. Abbreviations shorten words. By using them, students
are communicating more fluently, with more complex and nuanced language. Idioms are an
important aspect of learning vocabulary, and by using them, students can become better speakers.
These skills go beyond the basic communication skills.


~~**TRICKY SPELLINGS**~~


As new spellings are introduced, some complexity is added to the reading process. Some of the
spelling units that students have to process are ambiguous in the sense that they can stand for more
than one sound. These ambiguous spellings are called “tricky spellings.” In Unit 10, instruction focuses
on introducing spelling patterns and reviewing final syllables. Students will continue learning how to
decode, encode, and syllabicate words with these commonly used final stable syllables.


~~**TRICKY WORDS & HIGH-FREQUENCY WORDS**~~


Tricky Words are introduced in this unit on an as-needed basis in the context of the different
selections included in the Reader. Tricky Words should be taught in the lessons before the reading
selections are assigned. When introducing Tricky Words, be sure to draw attention to the parts that
are read (and spelled) just as students would expect based on what they have learned so far, and
also point out the tricky parts of each word.


Introduction
**1**


**2**



The Tricky Words taught in this unit are:


 - Lesson 1 - _brilliant, journey_


 - Lesson 2 - _technique, rhythm, language, distinguishing_


 - Lesson 3 - _doubt_


 - Lesson 4 - _conquer, natural_


 - Lesson 5 - _annual_


 - Lesson 9 - _routines_


In addition to addressing Tricky Words and tricky spellings, this program emphasizes the reading
and spelling of high-frequency words carefully selected from word lists compiled by researchers
Edward William Dolch and Edward Fry. These lists are instrumental in aiding students, particularly
young learners, to become more proficient readers by focusing on words that frequently appear in
English reading materials.


Specifically for Grade 3 students, the lists include 132 words, of which this program provides explicit
instruction for 98. These words are selected based on their prevalence across various unit Readers,
ensuring instruction is both relevant and practical. Instruction is integrated into lessons at points
where students will naturally encounter these words within the assigned sections of the Readers.


The program encourages students to identify and recall previously taught high-frequency words
to reinforce learning, thereby gradually expanding their lexicon through repeated exposure. This
strategic approach ensures that students learn to recognize and use these essential words and
improve their reading fluency and comprehension.


The curriculum includes a structured approach for teaching high-frequency words, starting with the
introduction of eight to twelve keywords at the beginning of each unit, selected for their relevance
and frequency in the unit’s text. Words are introduced using phonetic sounding and Spelling Cards
for decoding. Throughout the unit, these words are reviewed in various contexts, including through
decode/encode games and fluency checkpoints to assess automaticity and fluency. This ensures
that students engage with the words multiple times, enhancing their reading skills and confidence.


The high-frequency words taught in this unit are:


- Lesson 1 - _eight_, _school_


- Lesson 2 - _song_, _enough_


- Lesson 5 - _watch_, _show_


- Lesson 9 - _almost_, _list_


Foundational Skills 10


~~**DECODABLE READER: SAM’S MUSICAL JOURNEY**~~


The Unit 10 Reader tells the story of Sam, an eight-year-old who has a love for music. After a
suggestion from his friend Ben, Sam decides to learn the piano. With the support of his mom, Mrs.
Anderson (his music teacher), and an old family piano, Sam begins his musical journey. Sam faces
challenges in learning to read sheet music and playing different notes on the piano. With Mrs.
Anderson’s guidance, he perseveres through difficulties, gains confidence, and hones his skills.
Sam overcomes his doubts and decides to audition for the school talent show. Sam successfully
auditions for the talent show and, with Mrs. Anderson’s help, prepares for his performance.
Overcoming nerves and self-doubt, Sam delivers a remarkable piano performance, impressing the
audience. His journey demonstrates the rewards of perseverance and the joy of sharing his love for
music with others.


Each time students encounter a new section of text in the Reader, the lesson includes new
vocabulary words and/or phrases to accompany the section of text. There are lessons in which
students reread sections of the Reader, for the purpose of building fluency. These lessons do not
introduce new vocabulary or have a vocabulary chart.


~~**FORMATIVE ASSESSMENTS AND ADDITIONAL SUPPORT**~~


Throughout this unit, formative assessments are clearly marked for monitoring individual student
performance and progress in key skills. Quick Checks for Understanding to evaluate classroom
performance as a whole are also designated in each lesson. Fluency practice takes place regularly
throughout the unit. Records for recording student performance in an Anecdotal Reading Record,
Grade 3 Foundational Skills Record, Grade 3 Fluency Record, and Grade 3 End-of-Year Summary are
included in the Teacher Resources.


~~**STUDENT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT**~~


In Lessons 14 and 15, you will be prompted to administer a multipart end-of-unit assessment. In the
first part, you will work one-on-one with students to complete the Fluency Assessment. Students
will engage in a review activity while awaiting their turn for the assessment. The Reading and
Spelling portion of the assessment takes place during the first 20 minutes of the second lesson.
Once students have completed the assessment, they will have time for Self-Sustained Reading.
Use time in this lesson to finish working with students who still need to complete the Fluency
Assessment in the previous lesson.


The target words in each of these assessments include the vowel sound/spellings taught in this
unit; distractors have been intentionally selected because they represent frequent sound/spelling
confusions. Student performance on these assessments is a good indicator of whether students
have mastered the new sound/spellings.


Introduction

~~**CURSIVE WRITING**~~


At Grade 3, students are expected to write neatly in cursive, using correct letter formation and
leaving space between words. Throughout the program, teachers are prompted to remind students
of this expectation and provide corrective feedback.


Note that the lessons and activity pages do not comprise an exhaustive handwriting program, and
teachers may wish to consult other sources for information on topics such as writing posture, pencil
grip, and differentiated instruction for left-handed students.


~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


Pausing Point suggestions for further practice and reinforcement appear at the end of the unit,
following the last unit lesson. Pausing Point activities are organized by the unit objectives they
address. It is strongly recommended that you pause for one or two days at the end of each unit to
solidify the skills introduced in it. All students will benefit from an additional opportunity to reread
pages from the decodable student Readers. It is particularly important to make use of targeted
activities if the end-of unit assessment and/or formative assessments indicate that any students
are experiencing difficulties with specific skills taught during the unit.


**Repeated Routines**


This unit strategically utilizes activities, games, and protocols from previous units to allow students
to practice new skills using familiar routines. Review and prepare for the following activities
introduced in previous units:


 - Speak and Spell


 - Reading and Dictation


 - Abbreviation Match Up Game


 - Roll It and Read It


 - Tap the Tricky Word


 - Choral Reading


 - Partner Reading


 - Swim to the Finish


 - Idiom Match


 - Stable Syllable Baseball


 - Extra Innings Affixes Baseball

site. This component has been designed to complement the unit. It consists of poetry, folklore,
and fables. These additional text selections provide opportunities for students to practice reading
with fluency and prosody (expression). See the Unit 1 introduction or directions in the Fluency
Supplement for further guidance.

Foundational Skills


**Beginning**



After reading the first
part of Chapter 1, have
students orally retell
what they have learned
about Sam and what Sam
wants to learn how to
do (play an instrument).
Provide pictures or
illustrations of Sam and
musical instruments to aid
comprehension and include
a word bank and a starter
phrase (i.e., Sam wants to
learn how to _______.) to
help students formulate
their retelling of the story.


**Intermediate**


Pair students, and have
them share what they have
learned in the first part of
Chapter 1 about playing
an instrument. Use the
sentence stem: “In chapter
one, I learned that ________.” .



________.



.




- Display this lesson’s high-frequency words: _eight_ and _school_ .


- Focus on the word _eight_ . Have students discuss with a partner anything they
notice about the word _eight_ . In previous units we have talked about vowel
teams. Underline the vowel team in this word ( _ei_ ). In the word _eight_ there is a
vowel team _ei_ at the beginning of the word. Discuss what sound the ei makes
in this word (/ _ae_ /.)


- Blend sounds aloud as you run your fingers under the word: / _ae_ / /t/. Clarify
the meaning of _eight_ as needed. Invite students to turn to a partner and use
the word in a sentence.


- Focus on the word _school_ . Point out that the digraph ch makes a hard ‘c’
sound /k/.


- Blend sounds aloud as you run your fingers under the word: /s/ /k/ /oo/ /l/.
Have students discuss with a partner anything they notice about the word
_school_ .


- Model fluent reading for a sentence or two, using appropriate rate,
expression, and pausing for punctuation.


- Then, assign students to read pages 1–12 aloud, either with a partner or
independently.


- Circulate and listen to students read, making notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record. Record notes about pausing
for punctuation, mispronunciation, self-correction, pacing, transposition of
words, and expression.


- Choose strategic prompts to check for comprehension as well as to check
for their ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or
multiple-meaning words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant
questions to clarify any information from the text or prompts. Example
prompts include:


1. **Literal:** What did Sam notice as he watched the musician play the piano at
the mall? ( _Sam looked around and noticed that people had stopped what_
_they were doing and were listening to the playful piano sounds._ )


2. **Inferential:** “What is the most likely reason Mrs. Anderson’s face lit up
with a warm smile on p. 12? ( _Answers may vary but should reflect that Mrs._
_Anderson is friendly and wants to help Sam learn to play the piano._ )


3. **Evaluative:** Do you think learning to play an instrument is important? Why
or why not? ( _Answers may vary but should reflect that instruments are vital_
_to making different types of music._ )

**Advanced High**


In pairs, students will retell
what they read in the first
part of Chapter 1. Have
them include at least two
to three events and key
details about each. You
may provide a word bank
for students or encourage
them to go back to the text.


~~**ELPS 1.E; ELPS 3.D**~~

4. **Evaluative:** In our country, we have the privilege of enjoying many
freedoms. Why do you think it was important that Sam had the freedom to
choose to play the piano? ( _Answers may vary._ )


 - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses.
Provide the following sentence stems:


   - At the mall, Sam noticed that...


   - The most likely reason Mrs. Anderson...


   - Having the freedom to choose the piano is important because…”


~~**PRACTICE PATTERN WRAP-UP (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Direct students to search for and list on a piece of paper or whiteboard the
five words with the _eigh_ in the section of text they just read.


 - Have students share the words and display them on the board or chart
paper: _neighborhood, eighteenth, eight, eighteen, weightless._


 - Read each word aloud. Direct students to echo you.


 - Have students turn to a partner and take turns using each word in a
sentence. Circulate and monitor, offering support for any words students
may not understand the meaning of.


Check for Understanding


During Pattern Wrap up, search, monitor and take note of which students were able

to identify the eigh spelling pattern. If a student lists a word that does not contain the

target skill pattern, pause to ask for clarification from the student.


**End Lesson**



Challenge


Provide students with a
list of words containing
the _eigh_ spelling pattern,
including single and
multisyllabic words.
Challenge students
to conduct a word
investigation where they
explore the etymology,
origins, and meanings of
the _eigh_ words. They can
research the historical
development of these
words and how the _eigh_
pattern came to be used in
English.

 - Write the following words on the board, and read them as you write: _table, giggle._


 - Ask students to work with a partner to determine where to divide the word
into syllable parts.


 - When students are finished, ask students to share what strategy they used to
determine where to divide the word.


 - Point out to students that when a syllable ends in _le_, they should look at how
many consonants come before the _le_ . Explain that when there is only one
consonant before _le_, we divide before the consonant. If there is a double
consonant before _le_, then we split those consonants.


 - Divide the syllables in _settle: set/tle._


 - Remind students that the syllables are divided this way because there is a
double consonant before the _le_, which means we split the consonants.


 - Ask: Where would I divide the syllables in s _table_ ? _(between the ‘a’ and the ‘b’)_


 - Ask: What is the rule that tells me that? _(When there is only one consonant_
_before le, we divide before the consonant.)_


 - Repeat this process with the words _double, dismantle_, _tangle,_ and _triangle._
Model how to decode each word after it has been split.

   - **Note:** In the word _double_, mention the tricky spelling _ou_ for the sound
/u/ when decoding.


 - Pronounce each word clearly, emphasizing the final stable syllables ( _ble, tle_,
and _gle_ ).


~~**PRACTICE WITH SYLLABLE SLICE (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 2.1.


 - Ask students to point to the first word and read it: _jumble_ .


 - Instruct students to slice (divide) the word into syllables, using a slash to
mark each syllable: _jum/ble_ .


 - Direct students to the blank lines. Explain that they will listen as you say each
word once, then listen again and write the word. Direct students to complete
their responses in cursive. Provide immediate and corrective feedback such
as, “Great job on the cursive ‘l’! Keep practicing to ensure the vertical stroke
remains straight and doesn’t slant.”


 - Say each word and then repeat it: assemble, brittle, rectangle, disentangle, belittle.


 - After dictating the words, have students work in partners to read the words
and slice the syllables.

 - Remind students that the syllables are divided this way because there is a
double consonant before the le, which means we split the consonants.


 - Instruct students to turn to Activity Page 3.1.


 - Read aloud the directions for reading: “Underline the final stable _–ble_, _–_
_tle_, and _–gle_ pattern in each word. Draw a slash to separate the syllables.”


 - Have students work with a partner to read each word, underline the _–ble_,
_–tle_, and _–gle_ pattern, and divide it into syllables.


 - Tell students to listen as you say a sentence using a word with the final
stable spelling _–ble_, _–tle_, and _–gle_ .


 - Read: Will you help me assemble the desk? She drew a rectangle on her
paper. It is unkind to belittle someone.


 - Tell students to write the sentence paying attention to correct spelling
and cursive format.


 - Circulate and monitor to check for correct letter formation. Offer
feedback such as:


   - “Check that your loops and tails are formed smoothly and connect to
the next letter.”


   - “Check the spacing between your words. Make sure there’s enough
room between each word to maintain readability.”


   - “Your cursive handwriting is developing nicely, demonstrating a good
balance between speed and legibility. Keep practicing regularly to build
on your current skills and achieve even greater proficiency.”

- Display the Tricky Word, read it, and use it aloud in a sentence:


  - _doubt_


- Point out which parts of the word are regular and can be blended as you
would expect and which parts are not regular and will either be taught later
or simply must be remembered.


  - Tricky Word: _doubt_ (Explain that the letters _bt_ are pronounced /t/.)


- Guide the class in reading the next section of _Sam’s Musical Journey_, starting
at “Sam nodded . . .” and ending at “. . . music he played.”


- Model fluent reading for one or two sentences, using appropriate rate,
expression, and pausing for punctuation.


- Then, assign students to read pages 20–24 aloud, either with a partner or
independently.


- Circulate and listen to students read, making notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record. Record notes about pausing
for punctuation, mispronunciation, self-correction, pacing, transposition of
words, and expression.


- Choose strategic prompts to check for comprehension. Have students listen
actively and ask relevant questions to clarify any information from the text or
prompts. Example prompts include:


1. Literal: What are the different types of musical notes? _(There is a whole_
_note, half note, quarter note, eighth note, and sixteenth note.)_


2. Inferential: What do Mrs. Anderson’s words and actions on p. 24 show about
her relationship with Sam? _(When she provides advice to Sam about not_
_giving up, this shows that she knows he can overcome his challenges.)_

3. Evaluative: What details on p. 20–21 support the idea that Sam did give up?
_(Sam continued to practice with Mrs. Anderson’s guidance, working through_
_each challenge one note at a time.)_


             - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses by
using these sentence stems:


                   - Mrs. Anderson’s words and actions on p. 24 show that. . .


                   - The details on page say. . .which shows that. . .


~~**PRACTICE WITH PATTERN WRAP UP (5 MIN.)**~~


              - Direct them to search for and highlight nine words with the final stable
syllables of _-ble, -tle,_ and _-gle_ in the section they just read.


             - Have students share the words and display them on the board or chart
paper: _jumble, struggle, little_ .


             - Read each word aloud. Direct students to echo you.


             - Have students turn to a partner and take turns using each word in a
sentence. Circulate and monitor, offering support for any words students
may not understand the meaning of.

Foundational Skills 10


 - Explain that the spelling pattern _ough_ can represent several sounds.


 - Write these six examples on the board. Each example is a different _ough_
sound:


1. though (/oe/)


2. through (/ue/)


3. rough (/u/ /f/)


4. cough (/o/ /f/)


5. thought (/aw/)


6. bough (/ou/)


 - Instruct students to repeat the examples and the sound the _ough_ makes.
Hand out sticky notes and ask students to generate words that follow the
pattern.


 - Tell students to write one _ough_ word on the sticky note and place them under
the correct use of the sound. ( _example words: tough, fought, overbought,_
_dough_ )


 - Read the words aloud and ask students to echo you. Have them discuss the
_ough_ sounds.


 - Next, write the words _fought, thoughtless, doughnut, thorough, enough_ and
have students isolate the _ough_ and decode the words.


 - Move students into partners to collaborate more about the _ough_ sounds.


 - Direct them to try pronouncing the words using one of the other sounds
for _ough._ Model this process with the word _bought_, pronouncing it as _boot_
as though the _ough_ were making the /ue/ sounds as in _through_ . Remind
students that they can look at the board for _ough_ word ideas. Have students
repeat the instructions and then release partners to begin, making many
different combinations of words and sounds. Encourage humor!

partner, and discuss what abbreviations usually begin and end with. ( _a capital_
_letter and a period_ )


  - On the board write these words: _butterfly, doughnut, breakfast, lighthouse._


**TEKS 3.1.D** Work collaboratively with others by following agreed-upon rules, norms, and protocols; **TEKS 3.2.A.iii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding compound words, contractions, and abbreviations.


Foundational Skills 10


  - Have students look at the words on the board and discuss with a partner
what they notice about all the words? _(All the words are compound words.)_


  - Ask students to turn to a partner and recall what compound words are.


  - Ask the partners to think of an example of a compound word.


  - Use a randomizer (popsicle sticks with students’ names, dice, or online
randomizer) to call on a student, and ask them to share what they came up
with in their partner group. ( _A compound word is made by combining two_
_smaller words to create a new word.)_


  - Explain that compound words are when two or more words combine to form
a new single word. Each word within a compound word has its own meaning.
When the words are combined into a compound word, the compound word
has a new meaning.


  - Write the word _cupcake_ on the board.


  - Ask: What vowel sounds do you see? ( _short u/ a_e_ ). What two words form
this compound word? _(cup_ and _cake)_


  - Ask students how many syllables are in the word “cupcake” (two). Have
students explain what a cupcake is to a partner.


  - Repeat with the following words by having students isolate the vowel sounds
and then decode the words: _sailboat, lighthouse, playground,_ and _dragonfly._


~~**BUILD COMPOUND WORDS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Explain to the students that they will work collaboratively with a partner to
complete the task. Ask students to turn to Activity Page 7.1.


  - Distribute Compound Word Cards (located in the teacher resources on TR
7.1) Students will cut out the word cards and definitions.


  - Read the definitions that were cut out from page TR 7.1, and then work
with a partner to combine the individual words on the word cards to create
compound words that match the definition.


  - Glue the definition card under the definition column, and glue the matching
compound words next to the corresponding definition on Activity Page 7.1.


  - After finishing, have students take turns using each compound word in a
sentence with their partners.

**Beginning**
As an alternative to Partner
Reading, read a sentence,
and have the group repeat
the sentence to you,
working on fluently using
expressions while reading.


**Intermediate**
As an alternative to
Partner Reading, read the
text slowly, pointing to
the words. Have students
put a sticky note by any
words they notice that
talk about expression
or feelings. Discuss
these expressions and
feelings. Have students
reread the text with their
partner, remembering
these expressions and
incorporating them in how
they reread the text.


**Advanced/Advanced**
**High**
To demonstrate reading
comprehension have
students retell this
portion of the Reader
after Partner Reading.
Students should include
two to three main events,
including supporting
details. Provide sentence
frames such as: One main
event in this portion of
the Reader is _______,
and a supporting detail
is ________. Encourage
students to listen to their
partner’s response and
build on their ideas.


~~**ELPS 4.G; ELPS 4.I**~~

 - As students partner read, note students who need additional support
with fluency, including accuracy, rate, and prosody. Circulate and listen to
students read, making notes regarding their individual reading ability in the
Anecdotal Reading Record. Consider pulling these students to better assess
and address fluency gaps.


 - Choose strategic prompts to check for comprehension while students
are practicing rereading for fluency. Have students listen actively and ask
relevant questions to clarify any information from the text or prompts.
Examples include:


1. **Literal:** What did Sam discover at the mall to help him realize the
instrument he should play? _(He heard a piano being played at the mall.)_


2. **Inferential:** What can be inferred about how Sam’s mom felt about him
wanting to play the piano? How do you know? ( _Sam’s mom felt excited_
_about him wanting to play the piano. I can tell because in the text she made_
_sure he had a piano and polished it for him.)_


3. **Evaluative:** How did Mrs. Anderson encourage Sam when he was feeling
doubtful about his ability to read music? ( _Mrs. Anderson encouraged Sam_
_by remind him that learning the piano takes time and that it’s normal to_
_struggle at first, but he shouldn’t give up.)_


 - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses
using the following sentence stems:


   - Sam discovered...


   - I can infer that...


   - Mrs. Anderson encouraged Sam by...


Check for Understanding


Ask students to retell and paraphrase what they read. They should use the words,

_First, Then, Next,_ and _Last_, and include the main events, characters, and significant

details. Observe Partner Reading to check that students are reading with expression

and their ability to retell the story events in logical order.

- Tell students they will work with affixes today. Give Partner A 30 seconds
to explain to partner B what an affix is. _(An affix is a group of letters added_
_to a base word; these letters change the meaning of the word when they are_
_added._ )


- Give Partner B 30 seconds to share examples of words with affixes. _(nonstick,_
_impatient, etc…)_


- Remind students that prefixes are a type of affix that comes before the base
word, and suffixes are a type of affix that comes after the base word.


- Display Word Matrix (Digital Component 9.1 or TR 9.1) and tell students they
will work with three prefixes today: _im–_, _in–_, and _pre–_ . Explain that _im–_
means “into,” _in–_ means “not or non,” and _pre–_ means “before.”


- Write the word _import_ on the board.


- Clap the syllables, prompting students to echo the clapping and
pronunciation. Remind students that a prefix adds another syllable to the
base word.


- Circle the prefix _im–_ in the word _import_ .


- Ask: What does the prefix _im–_ mean? _(into)_


- Ask: So what does the word _import_ mean? _(into the port)_


- Clarify that a port is a place where ships load and unload freight for trade.


- Tell students that the prefix _im–_ can also mean _not_, so they will need to pay
attention to the meaning of the base word when determining the meaning of
the prefix and how it changes the meaning of the base word.


- Write the word _impossible_ on the board.


- Clap the syllables, prompting students to echo the clapping and
pronunciation. Remind students that a prefix adds another syllable to the
base word.


- Ask students to turn to a partner and identify the prefix in the word. Then,
have them discuss the meaning of the word “impossible”. Have a few
students share their answers. Clarify that in this word, the prefix _im–_ means
“not.” Point out that “into possible” wouldn’t make sense.


- Write the words _ineffective_ and _preseason_ on the board. Have students
work with a partner to identify the prefix and meaning of each word. Provide
students with dictionaries to clarify the meaning of each word or to check
their definition’s accuracy. Challenge students to use a different prefix or
suffix to change the meaning of the base words season and effect.

                   - Model fluent reading for a sentence or two, using appropriate rate,
expression, and pausing for punctuation. On page 47, take the sentence,
“Sam knew he wanted to make an _impact_ at the show.” Talk about how the
word _impact_ is a bolded word. While reading try emphasizing that word. How
does that change the expression of what you read? ( _It makes the word stand_
_out._ )


             - Then, assign students to read pages 47–52 aloud, either with a partner or
independently.


              - Circulate and listen to students read, making notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record. Record notes about
appropriate rate, pausing for punctuation, mispronunciation, self-correction,
pacing, transposition of words, and expression.


             - Choose strategic prompts to check for comprehension as well as to check
for their ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or
multiple-meaning words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant
questions to clarify any information from the text or prompts. Example
prompts include:


1. **Literal:** How did Sam feel when he found out he would be performing in the
talent show? ( _He was full of joy._ )


2. **Literal:** What can the reader infer about Mrs. Anderson based on these
sentences from the text? “Mrs. Anderson knew that choosing the right
song was crucial. She wanted it to be an immediate hit for the crowd.” ( _The_
_reader can infer that Mrs. Anderson was going to try to choose the best song_
_for Sam, so he could win the contest._ )


3. **Evaluative:** What evidence from the text supports the idea that Sam was
determined to do his best? ( _He practiced every day and could tell he was_
_making improvements._ )

does the use of idioms make someone’s writing more interesting or creative?
_(Authors use idioms to add description or humor to their writing. These_
_expressions create imagery that can be fun and make writing interesting.)_


 - Direct students to work in small groups to match the idiomatic expression
with its meaning. Remind students that when they are working together,
they should speak clearly about the topic, give their partner eye contact,
and speak in a manner in which their partner will understanding including:
how slow or fast they speak (their rate), how loud or soft they speak (their

**Beginning**
Provide students with
a word bank of feeling
words: sad, happy, relieved,
nervous, proud, scared,
angry. Ask students to use
those words in a sentence
using the stem: Sam most
likely felt ___ at the end of
his performance because

____.


**Intermediate**
Ask students to think
of words to describe
how Sam felt after his
performance. Ask students
to discuss with a partner
using those words in
a sentence. Provide
sentence stems such as:
Sam most likely felt ___ at
the end of his performance
because ____.


**Advanced/**
**Advanced High**
Ask students to turn to
a partner to discuss how
Sam felt at the end of his
performance. Ask students
to use text evidence to
support their answer. Then
have students write a
sentence about how Sam felt
and read it to their partner.

- Model fluent reading for a sentence or two, using appropriate rate,
expression, and pausing for punctuation.


- Then, assign students to read pages 54–62 aloud, either with a partner
or independently.


- Direct students to pay particular attention to when the author has included
an idiom to make the story more descriptive.


- Circulate and listen to students read, making notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record. Record notes about
appropriate rate, pausing for punctuation, mispronunciation, self-correction,
pacing, transposition of words, and expression.


- Choose strategic prompts to check for comprehension as well as to check
for their ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or
multiple-meaning words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant
questions to clarify any information from the Reader or strategic prompts.
Example prompts include:


1. **Literal:** What happened when Sam finished the performance? ( _Sam played_
_his final notes, and there was a moment of silence. Suddenly, the audience_
_erupted with noise. Everyone clapped and cheered._ )


2. **Inferential:** What is the most likely reason the author uses figurative
language in the sentence, ”Anticipation washed over him...” to describe Sam
before the talent show? ( _to show that we was excited about performing_ )


3. **Inferential:** What is the most likely reason the author uses the idiom ”butterflies
in my stomach” to describe how Sam was feeling? ( _to describe Sam’s feeling of_
_nervousness, to help the reader understand how Sam was feeling_ )


- Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses by
asking questions such as the following:


  - When Sam finished his performance...


  - The most likely reason the author uses figurative language is because...


  - The most likely reason the author uses the idiom is because...


- As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record and provide immediate and
corrective feedback regarding their rate and expression. Offer feedback to
students such as:


  - “Remember to vary your reading speed depending on what’s happening in
the story. Use expression to make the characters’ voices sound different.”


  - “Pay close attention to the punctuation and use it to guide your expression.”

~~**PRACTICE WITH IDIOM MATCH (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 12.2. Read the directions.


  - Clarify that students will read excerpts from the Reader, _Sam’s Musical_
_Journey_, and determine which idiom could be added into the text to retain
the meaning. Students should choose idioms listed on Activity Page 12.1.


  - Release students to begin. Direct students to write in cursive leaving space
between words. Provide immediate and corrective feedback such as “I’ve
noticed that your cursive letter ‘o’ tends to be slightly uneven in its formation.
Try to make sure the top and bottom curves are symmetrical.”


Activity Page 12.2: Idiom Match


Collect and assess Activity Page 12.2 to determine students’ ability to
understand the meaning of idiomatic expressions and how to accurately

and Mittens” with you.


  - Ask the student for Activity Page 14.1 (Unit 10 Fluency Assessment) and
Activity Page 14.2 (Unit 10 Fluency Assessment Questions).


  - Tell the student that you are going to ask them to read the text aloud.


  - Explain that you are going to use a watch to see how long it takes them to
read the text. Tell the student that this is not a race; they should read at their
regular pace and not rush.


  - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the title. If you are
using a watch, write the exact start time on your record page in minutes and
seconds.


  - If you are using a stopwatch, you do not need to write down the start time
since the stopwatch will calculate elapsed time.


  - As the student reads the text, make a running record on the copy with the
student’s name using the following guidelines:


**TEKS 3.1.C** Speak coherently about the topic under discussion, employing eye contact, speaking rate, volume, enunciation,
and the conventions of language to communicate ideas effectively; **TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and
prosody) when reading grade level text.

 - When the student finishes reading the text, write the exact finish time in
minutes and seconds on your record sheet.


 - Alternatively, if you are using a stopwatch, simply write down the elapsed
time in minutes and seconds.


 - If the student reads very slowly, you may need to stop the reading before the
student gets to the end of the text. (Three minutes should be enough time to
get a measurement.) If the student does not read to the end, draw a vertical
line on the record sheet to indicate how far the student read. Also, write down
either the Finish Time or the Elapsed Time.


 - Repeat this process for additional students.


Activity Page 14.2: Fluency Assessment


If the reading was fairly accurate (< 10 uncorrected errors), you can get a rough (and

easy) estimate of a student’s W.C.P.M. score simply by noting the time and looking at

the Unit 10 W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


Foundational Skills 10


  - To calculate a student’s exact W.C.P.M. score, follow the described steps:


    - First, complete the Words section of the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


    - Count Words Read. This is the total number of words that the student
read or attempted to read, up to the point where they stopped. It
includes words that the student read correctly as well as words that the
student read incorrectly or skipped over. If the student attempted to
read the whole text, including the title, use 307 words as your total. If
the student did not finish the text, you will need to count the number of
words that the student actually attempted to read. Write the count for
Words Read in the matching box on the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


    - Count the uncorrected mistakes noted in your running record. This
includes words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and words
that you had to supply. Write the total in the box labeled Uncorrected
Mistakes. (A mistake that is corrected by the student is not counted as
a mistake; the student is penalized for the time they lost making the
correction, but not for the initial mistake.)


    - Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get Words Correct.


    - Next, complete the Time section of the activity page.


    - Calculate elapsed time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a stopwatch,
this should already be done for you. Skip to the next step.) If you used a
watch and recorded start and stop times, you will need to subtract the
Start Time from the Finish Time to calculate the Elapsed Time. Subtract
seconds from seconds then minutes from minutes. Calculate Time in
Seconds. Multiply the number of minutes by 60 to convert minutes to
seconds, and then add the number of seconds.


    - Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then, multiply by 60 to get
Words Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.).


  - As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider:


    - It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.
scores. However, a major goal for Grade 3 students is to read with
sufficient fluency to ensure comprehension and independent reading of
school assignments in subsequent grades. Exact fluency targets vary
from state to state; the national mean calculated by Hasbrouck and
Tindal in 2017 for Spring of Grade 3 is 112 W.C.P.M.


    - A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared with the score of other
students in the classroom (or grade level) and also with the national
fluency norms for Spring of Grade 3 obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal.
Students whose scores are below the 25th percentile (91 W.C.P.M) are
experiencing serious problems in reading fluently.


Lesson 14 Fluency Assessment
**115**


- Compare the student’s W.C.P.M. score to national norms for Spring of Grade
3 (Hasbrouck and Tindal, 2017):






|Reading Time<br>for this Text|W.C.P.M.|National Percentiles<br>for Spring, Grade 3|
|---|---|---|
|2:35|166|90th|
|3:05|139|75th|
|4:05|112|50th|
|5:55|91|25th|
|8:00|63|10th|



**116**




 - After you have entered each student’s scores on the W.C.P.M Calculation
(TR 14.3) Sheet, record them on the Grade 3 End-of-Year Summary for each
student.

Pausing Point

This is the end of Unit 10. Analyze the results from the Unit 10 Assessments
in the two previous lessons and determine which skills in the unit students
need to review. Pause here and spend 1-2 days providing targeted
acceleration in the specific areas of weakness. This is also a good time
to expand the abilities of students who are able to go further and need a
challenge. Students can do any combination of the exercises listed below,
in any order. The exercises are listed by unit objectives. You may find that
different students need extra practice with different objectives. It can be
helpful to have students focus on specific exercises in small groups.

~~**MORE HELP WITH SPELLING PATTERNS**~~


**Targeted Dictation for eigh and ai**


  - You may wish to do this exercise cooperatively, offering feedback as you
complete the items, rather than presenting it in test-like format where no
feedback is given until you return the students’ written work.


  - Choose one of the following sets of words.


  - Ask students to take out a pencil and a piece of paper.


  - Explain you are going to say ten words and all words will follow a pattern.


  - Ask students to provide the pattern for the words you have chosen.


  - Tell students to write each word you say.


  - Explain that you are going to say five words, all will have the /ae/ sound
spelled _eigh_ or _ai_ . Tell students, for this exercise, they should use the _eigh_
spelling if the / _ae_ / sound is at the end of a syllable and the _ai_ spelling in all
other cases.


~~**MORE HELP WITH FINAL STABLE SYLLABLES**~~


**Stable Syllable Baseball**


  - Divide the class into two teams. Have one team at a time come to the front of
the room in front of the Final Stable Syllable Baseball Game Board (located
at the end of this Pausing Point section) and line up.


  - To play, teams take turns “at bat”:


    - Pick a card from the pile (Stable Syllable Baseball Word Cards located
at the end of this Pausing Point section) and ask the first person on the
team to read it.


    - If the word is read correctly, draw a line from home plate to first base,


Foundational Skills 7


signifying a “hit.” This player should go to the back of his team’s line while
the next player comes forward to read the next card. If the second player
reads the word correctly, draw a line from first to second base.


    - Play continues in this way, so that each time a player reads the word
correctly, you draw a line to the next base. If the fourth player reads the
word correctly, draw a line from third base to home plate and mark “1
run” for this team.


    - Play continues for the members of this team so long as no words are
misread. When a word is misread, the next team takes its turn at bat.


    - As in the actual game of baseball, any players “left on base” when a word
is misread do not count or add to the score.


~~**MORE HELP WITH ABBREVIATIONS**~~


**Abbreviation Match Word Cards**


  - Make copies of Abbreviation Match Word Cards located at the end of
this Pausing Point section. Have students cut out each of the words and
abbreviations.


  - Then have students mix all their cards they cut out. Have students match the
abbreviation to the word it goes with. For example: Mr. with Mister


  - After one round of matching independently, students can get with a partner
and use one set of the abbreviation cards to play a matching game.


  - The pair of students will flip their cards over and take turns picking two at
a time. If they pick an abbreviation that matches with the word, they get to
keep the set. If they don’t match, they have to put them back in the middle
facedown with all the other cards. Continue this until student pairs find all the
sets of abbreviation matches.


**Roll It and Read It**


  - Move students into pairs. Provide each pair with one Roll It and Read It


  - Game Board (located at the end of this Pausing Point section), one game
piece, and one die.


  - Game board will need to be set up with Roll It and Read It Word List. (located
at the end of this Pausing Point section)


  - Explain the game instructions:


    - One player rolls the die.


    - That player moves the game piece the number of spaces indicated by the
die number.


Pausing Point
**127**


**128**




    - That player reads the Abbreviation on the space they landed on. Then
they write one sentence using the Abbreviation, while their partner writes
a sentence using the word the abbreviation stands for.


    - The next player rolls the die and repeats the process with the same game
piece.


    - The first pair of students who get to the end of their game board with
correct sentences for each of the abbreviations they landed on is the
winning group.


    - If time permits, students can play multiple rounds.


~~**MORE HELP WITH AFFIXES**~~


**Play Swim to the Finish**


  - Move students into pairs.


  - Give each pair a copy of the Swim to the Finish Game Board (located at the
end of this Pausing Point section) and a set of Swim to the Finish Word Cards.
(located at the end of this Pausing Point section)


  - Have each student write their name or initials at the top of a column, or swim
lane.


  - Explain the game:


    - Place cards face down in a pile. Students take turns drawing a card and
reading the word on the card.


    - When students read their words correctly, they should write a check
mark in the next square of their swim lane.


    - The first one to the finish line wins! If both students read all of their
words correctly, it will be a tie swim meet.


  - Have students play one full round of the game. If time allows, they can shuffle
the cards and play again, marking spaces with an ‘X’ or other marking of their
choice. You may also choose to use laminated boards and dry erase markers.


**Extra Innings Affixes Baseball**


  - Divide the class into two teams. Have one team at a time come to the front of
the room in front of the Affix Baseball Game Board (located at the end of this
Pausing Point section) and line up.


  - To play, teams take turns “at bat”:


Foundational Skills 7


    - Pick a card from the pile (Affix Baseball Word Cards located at the end of
this Pausing Point section) and ask the first person on the team to read it.


    - If the word is read correctly, draw a line from home plate to first base,
signifying a “hit.” This player should go to the back of his team’s line while
the next player comes forward to read the next card. If the second player
reads the word correctly, draw a line from first to second base.


    - Play continues in this way, so that each time a player reads the word
correctly, you draw a line to the next base. If the fourth player reads the
word correctly, draw a line from third base to home plate and mark “1
run” for this team.


    - Play continues for the members of this team so long as no words are
misread. When a word is misread, the next team takes its turn at bat.


    - As in the actual game of baseball, any players “left on base” when a word
is misread do not count or add to the score.


~~**MORE HELP WITH IDIOMS**~~


**Idiom Match Up**


  - Make copies of Idiom Match Up Cards located at the end of this Pausing
Point section. Have students cut out each of the idioms and meanings.


  - Then have students mix all their cards they cut out. Have students match the
idiom with the meaning. For example: ‘Burn the midnight oil.’ with ‘To work
late into the night.’


  - After one round of matching independently, students can get with a partner
and use one set of the idiom cards to play a matching game.


  - The pair of students will flip their cards over and take turns picking two at
a time. If they pick an idiom that matches with the meaning, they get to
keep the set. If they don’t match, they have to put them back in the middle
facedown with all the other cards. Continue this until student pairs find all the
sets of idiom matches.

**Book Circle**


  - Divide students into groups.


  - Have students read any of the Unit 1–10 readers or an approved trade book.


  - Assign students the following roles:


    - Reader Leader: The Reader Leader’s responsibility is to read aloud a
portion of the decodable reader during each book circle meeting. They
should demonstrate fluency, clear pronunciation, and expressive reading
to engage the group and enhance comprehension.


    - Discussion Director: The Discussion Director leads the group in
discussing key elements of the story, such as characters, setting, plot
events, and main ideas.


    - Word Wiz: The Word Wiz focuses on identifying and understanding
unfamiliar words encountered during reading. They help the group
decipher the meanings of these words through context clues, word
analysis strategies, and discussions.


    - Time Keeper: The Time Keeper helps ensure that the book circle stays
on track and manages the allotted time for each activity or discussion.
They use a timer or clock to monitor the duration of reading sessions,
discussions, and transitions between roles.


**Fluency Café**

Grade 3 Foundational Skills Record


Teacher Instructions: Create one copy of the Foundational Skills Record per student. Use assessments
within the unit to track the student’s progress toward mastery of each standard. Use the rating system
to indicate the level of teacher support required and the space provided to take notes.


  - Students at level 1 require focused instruction to accelerate learning in a specific area. Use the
Additional Supports and Pausing Points to target areas of growth.


  - Students at levels 2 and 3 should be showing steady growth. These students would benefit from the
Take Home Materials and side-bar support suggestions within each lesson.


  - Students at level 4 are excelling. Use the side-bar challenge suggestions to increase rigor.

Grade 3 Fluency Record


Choose texts from the Grade 3 Fluency Packet or the Unit Readers for students to read aloud
as you measure their pace and accuracy. Subtract the Words Missed (words that are omitted,
mispronounced, or substituted for another word) from the Total Words in Text to determine the
number of Words Read Correctly. Divide the Words Read Correctly by the Total Words in Text to
determine the students’ accuracy. Record how long it takes the students to read the passage to
determine their Words Per Minute. Consider both accuracy and pace as well as expression when
evaluating a student’s overall fluency.

Overview of the
Grade 3 Skills Program


~~**THE SIMPLE VIEW OF READING**~~


Virtually everyone who writes about reading now recognizes that reading comprehension requires
more than just decoding ability. Many reading researchers now subscribe to a view of reading that is
known as “the simple view of reading.” This view, which is associated with reading researchers Philip
Gough and William Tunmer, holds that there are two chief elements that are crucially important to
reading comprehension: decoding skills and language comprehension ability.


To achieve reading comprehension, a person needs to be able to decode the words on the page and
then make sense of those words. The first task is made possible by decoding skills and the second
by language comprehension ability. If the person cannot decode the words on the page, he or she
will not be able to achieve reading comprehension, no matter how much oral language he or she
can understand. Even if the person can decode the words on the page, that in and of itself is still no
guarantee of reading comprehension. Thus, if a person cannot understand sentences when they
hear them, they are unlikely to understand those sentences when reading.


Supporters of the simple view—and there are a growing number of them among reading
researchers—argue that a person’s reading comprehension ability can be predicted, with a high
degree of accuracy, based on two basic measures. The first is a measure of decoding skills (e.g.,
a test of single-word reading or pseudo-word reading). The second is a measure of listening
comprehension. Researchers who hold to the simple view say, “Tell me a person’s decoding ability,
as ascertained by a word-reading task, and tell me that person’s language comprehension ability,
as ascertained by a listening comprehension task, and I can make a very accurate prediction of that
person’s reading comprehension ability.” If the person is a rapid and accurate decoder and also able
to understand a wide range of oral language—for instance, classroom presentations, news items
on the radio or TV, books on tape, etc.—then it is a safe bet the person will also do well on tests of
reading comprehension.


An interesting thing about the simple view of reading is that it can be expressed as an equation:





In this equation, each of the letters is a variable that stands for a specific skill:


R is a measure of reading comprehension ability.


Appendix A: Overview of the Skills Strand
**207**


**208**



D is a measure of decoding skills.


C is a measure of language-comprehension ability as measured using a listening task.


Each of these skills can be quantified as a numerical value between 0 and 1, where 0 stands for no
ability whatsoever and 1 stands for perfect, not-to-be-improved-upon ability. Most people have a
skill level that falls somewhere between these two extremes.


The equation says that if you have some decoding ability (D > 0) and you also have some language
comprehension ability (C > 0), you will probably also have some reading comprehension ability (R >
0). How much reading comprehension ability you have will depend on the exact values of D and C.


What does it mean to have no decoding ability (D = 0)? It means you cannot turn printed words into
spoken words. A person who cannot decode letters on a page cannot read. The person is illiterate.


What does it mean to have no language comprehension ability (C = 0)? It means you do not know
the language, and you cannot understand any of it when you hear other people speaking or reading
aloud in that language.


It is not very common for a person to have decoding ability (D > 0) but not language comprehension
ability (C = 0). Why would you learn to read and write a language you cannot understand? It does
happen. One famous example involves the English poet John Milton, the author of _Paradise Lost_ and
other well-known poems. Milton went blind late in life. Since Braille had not yet been invented, this
meant he could not read for himself. Nevertheless, Milton found a way to keep learning from books:
he had friends and relatives read the books aloud for him. However, he was not always able to find
a scholar who had the free time and the ability needed to read to him in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and
other ancient languages. The solution? Milton taught his daughters to decode these languages so
they could read books in those languages aloud to him. Milton did not teach his daughters the actual
languages—the thousands of words and tens of thousands of meanings. That would have been a
difficult, time-consuming task. He only taught them the rules they would need to turn letters into
sounds. Thus, his daughters acquired solid decoding skills for these languages (D > 0), but they
would have scored a zero on any measure of language comprehension (C = 0). They could turn
symbols into sounds, but they had no idea what the sounds meant. Milton, on the other hand, due
to his blindness, had no functional decoding skills (D = 0). However, by virtue of his great learning,
he was able to understand Hebrew, Latin, and Greek when they were read aloud to him (C > 0).
Between Milton and his daughters, you might say, there was reading comprehension (R), but the
younger generation brought the decoding skills (D) and the elderly poet brought the language
comprehension (C).


The Milton example is an unusual one, but it is possible to give a less unusual one. A decent teacher
can teach you to decode Russian letters (or the letters used in many other writing systems) in the


Foundational Skills 1


course of a couple days of intensive work. Since you already know a lot about reading, all you would
need to learn is which sound values the unfamiliar letters stand for. Once you learned that, you
would be able to sound out most of the words in the language, but nobody would claim that you are
reading Russian. You would have some rudimentary decoding skills (D > 0), but you would be lacking
language comprehension (C = 0). You would be able to pronounce words, but you would not be able
to make sense of them. Essentially, you would be doing what Milton’s daughters did.


~~**HOW THESE IDEAS INFORM THIS PROGRAM**~~


Although this may seem very abstract and theoretical, there are two ideas here that are very
important for reading instruction and for understanding this program. The first important idea
is that reading comprehension depends crucially on both decoding skills (D) and language
comprehension ability (C); the second is that language comprehension ability takes much longer to
acquire than decoding skills.


Milton chose to teach his daughters decoding skills because he could teach those relatively quickly.
It would have taken him much, much longer to build up their language comprehension abilities.
Likewise, in the hypothetical example just given, a decent teacher could teach you to decode
Russian print in a few days of intensive instruction, but he or she would need to keep working with
you for many weeks—possibly even many years—to teach you enough Russian words and phrases to
understand a movie, make sense of a radio report, or read a short story.


You are facing a similar situation as a teacher in the early grades. You want your students to learn
to read. A crucial first step is to teach them decoding skills. Strong decoding skills can be taught
to most young children throughout Grades K–3. It takes longer to teach decoding skills to young
children who are learning to read for the first time than it does to teach the same skills to adults
who have already learned to read in another language, and it takes longer to teach decoding skills in
English-speaking countries because English spelling is rather complex; but even so, most students
can acquire basic decoding ability in the early grades. The children will continue to automatize their
decoding skills, learn new spelling patterns, and build fluency for many more years, but the basics
can be taught in Grades K–3.


That is not the case with language comprehension ability. It is going to take you and your school
system a long time to build up your students’ language comprehension ability because this is not a
job you can accomplish in the course of a single school year. Rather, language comprehension ability
is acquired over many years. Your students began to develop a rudimentary ability to understand
language even before they could speak and continued to increase their language comprehension
abilities throughout the preschool years. They will make even more gains in your classroom and the
classrooms they join after yours. With each new sentence they read or hear, and each new subject
they study in school, they will be building up background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural
literacy, thus increasing the range of materials they are equipped to understand, first orally and later


Appendix A: Overview of the Skills Strand
**209**


**210**



via reading. The more you teach them and the more you expose them to, the more they will be able
to understand. It takes a long time to build up the vocabulary and knowledge needed to make sense
of most stories in a newspaper or magazine, but this buildup is crucial for your students’ reading
abilities: no matter how good their decoding skills may be, they will not understand what they read
unless they have the language comprehension ability to make sense of the words they decode.


The program includes two strands of instruction, and these strands correspond with the elements of
reading isolated in the simple view of reading. The Skills Strand is meant to build students’ decoding
skills (D), while the Knowledge Strand is meant to build students’ language comprehension ability
(C) by exposing them to vocabulary, concepts, and ideas through frequent reading aloud. It is
important to understand that both strands are crucial for reading comprehension in later grades.
You may feel the decoding skills taught in the Skills Strand are more important to teach in the early
grades, and certainly, this is the area where you can expect to have the most immediate impact,
but it is important that you not neglect language comprehension ability. Remember, it takes many
years to build up enough vocabulary and general knowledge to understand a wide range of printed
materials. The building of background knowledge needs to begin in Kindergarten (if not before) and
continue throughout the elementary and middle school years.


If students are not building their language comprehension ability in the early grades, their reading
scores are likely to begin to fall off in Grade 4 and later. This has been called the “fourth-grade
slump,” and it occurs because material assessed on reading tests changes over time. As students
progress through the grades, test questions focus less on rudimentary decoding skills and more
on comprehension—and comprehension depends on having sufficient vocabulary, background
knowledge, and cultural literacy to understand the words you are decoding. Thus, the importance
of language comprehension ability increases with time. A weakness in this area may not show up on
tests in early grades, but it will show up in later elementary grades.


This has been well documented in research. In one very interesting study, researchers at the
University of Kansas looked at measurements of reading comprehension (R), decoding/word
recognition (D), and listening comprehension (C) for the same 570 students in the second, fourth,
and eighth grades. They found the two factors D and C accurately predicted R in each grade
but that C became more important, in the sense that it explained more of the variation among
students over time. The measure of decoding (D) was extremely important in the second-grade
results. Twenty-seven percent of the variance in reading comprehension in second grade could be
explained by decoding skills (D) alone. Only 9 percent of the variance could be explained by listening
comprehension (C) alone. By fourth grade, however, the measure of listening comprehension
had begun to account for more variance: the unique contribution of C rose to 21 percent, while
the equivalent number for D fell. By eighth grade, fully 36 percent of the variance in reading
comprehension scores could be explained with reference to the children’s listening comprehension
ability. The unique contribution of D sank even further. In other words, while reading comprehension
depended on D and C at every stage, as the simple view would predict, C explained more and more


Foundational Skills 1


of the variation among students as time went by. What this tells us is that, once the intricacies of
decoding are mastered (and in English, this takes some time), reading comprehension depends
more and more heavily on language comprehension. Language comprehension depends on
background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural literacy.


~~**TWO MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT READING AND WRITING**~~


The Skills Strand teaches the mechanics of both reading and writing. It is based on the most current
research on reading and writing, but at the same time, it has been written in opposition to some ideas
that have been very influential in elementary education in recent decades. Two of those ideas are:


  - Learning to read and write is natural.


  - Learning to read and write is easy.


Both of these ideas have great emotional appeal. Unfortunately, both of them are wrong.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT NATURAL**~~


Many scholars have argued that spoken language is natural for human beings. The cognitive
scientist Stephen Pinker, for example, has argued that human beings have a language instinct,
meaning that humans are born with an innate capacity for learning language. This may turn out to
be true. It is at least a plausible theory since historians, linguists, and anthropologists have never
found a human culture that does not use language. When something is universal, it may turn out to
be natural.


What is true of oral language is not necessarily true of written language. In fact, with written
language, we know we are dealing with something that is not natural or innate because we know
when and where writing was invented, and we know that, even today, not all languages have a
system of writing. There are still hundreds of languages in the world that are spoken but not written
or read.


Ten thousand years ago this was the norm rather than an exception. At that time, there were
probably no human beings who knew how to read or write. According to the linguist Florian
Coulmas, the idea of writing down language was probably developed independently by three ancient
cultures: the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, and the Chinese. Each used a slightly different system, and
the mechanisms these pioneers developed for recording speech then spread from one culture to
another, evolving as they went. If these initial inventors had not come up with schemes for writing
down speech, we might all be illiterate today.


Writing is many things. It is an art that can be taught and learned. It is an invention—one of the
greatest inventions in human history. It is a technology enabling us to do things we could not do


Appendix A: Overview of the Skills Strand
**211**


**212**



without it—a technology every bit as exciting and amazing as airplane flight or electric power. But
it is not natural. The same is true of reading, which is simply the process of unpacking, or decoding,
what somebody else has written.


Reading and writing are both highly artificial. We tend to recoil at that word. We have internalized the
idea that natural is good and artificial is bad. Therefore, we think, reading must be natural. In fact, as
the reading researcher Philip Gough has written, reading is a highly unnatural act.


The first step toward good reading and writing instruction is to understand that reading and writing
are artificial—but not necessarily in a bad sense. We need to remind ourselves that the word _artificial_
derives from the word _art_ . To say reading and writing are forms of art that had to be invented and
need to be taught to children does not make reading and writing any less wonderful or important.
On the contrary, it makes these things more wonderful and precious, and it also emphasizes the
importance of your job as a teacher. There is no job more important than teaching young children
the magnificent, valuable, and highly unnatural arts of reading and writing.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT EASY**~~


The second idea noted earlier, that learning to read and write is easy, is also mistaken. Reading and
writing are complex behaviors, and they are more complex in English than in many other languages
because English has a fairly complicated spelling system. In Spanish, for example, the relationships
between letters and sounds are mostly one-to-one, meaning each sound is usually written with
one spelling, and each spelling unit is usually pronounced one way. This is not the case in English.
To read and write English with a high degree of accuracy, there is quite a lot that students need to
learn.


As a way of demonstrating the complexity involved in learning to read and write in English, suppose
we attempted to list all the discrete bits of information a person needs to know in order to be able
to read and write in English. As a starting point, we might begin with the 26 letters and argue that
these are the 26 things one really needs to learn to read and write English. However, for each letter,
one eventually needs to learn not only the letter shape but also the letter name (to be able to read
abbreviations and initials). So that is 52 bits of information.


That is a good start, but we must not stop there. In English, all letters can be written in uppercase
and lowercase forms, and the uppercase forms are not always the same as the lowercase forms.
Compare ‘B’ to ‘b,’ ‘D’ to ‘d,’ ‘H’ to ‘h,’ ‘R’ to ‘r,’ and ‘Q’ to ‘q.’ At least 16 uppercase letters have a slightly
different form than the matching lowercase letters. So we must raise our estimate of the complexity
of the English writing system to 68 bits of information.


We are not done yet. Students must also know the 44 sounds these letters stand for. That raises our
estimate of the complexity to 112.


Foundational Skills 1


If there were a simple one-to-one relationship between letters and sounds, that might be a fairly
good estimate of the complexity of the code. Unfortunately, the relationships between sounds and
letters in English are quite complicated. The 44 sounds of English can be spelled many different
ways. In our work on this program, we have identified 150 spellings that are frequent enough to be
worth teaching in the early grades. That boosts our estimate of the complexity of the code to 262.


In addition, students need to learn to track from left to right, blend sounds into words (when
reading), and segment words into sounds (when writing and spelling). They need to learn a handful
of symbols used in writing, including the period, comma, exclamation point, question mark,
quotation mark, and apostrophe. That raises our estimate of code complexity to about 270 bits of
information.


We could boost the estimate even higher by adding Tricky Words and unusual spellings or by
pointing out that many letters in English can be pronounced in different ways. We could also point
out that reading a word like _thin_ requires students to group the first two letters and attach them to
one sound, and reading a word like _cake_ requires students to scan ahead, see the ‘e,’ and realize it
controls the pronunciation of the ‘a’ earlier.


Even without these additions, it is clear that the English writing system is quite complicated.


~~**THE PROBLEM WITH WHOLE LANGUAGE**~~


On a conservative estimate, there are 270 bits of knowledge a person needs to be able to read and
write English. It is unwise to ask students to tackle all this complexity at once and hope they will
figure it out. Yet that is precisely what is done in so-called “Whole Language” approaches. Whole
Language instruction is based on the assumption that learning to read is natural and not difficult,
so reading skills can be allowed to develop gradually, without much explicit instruction. Lots of
students in Whole Language classrooms do manage to figure out the English writing system, but
many others do not. Whole Language ideas have tremendous emotional appeal, but the Whole
Language approach is actually a recipe for _leaving many children behind_ . It is an especially risky
strategy for disadvantaged children.


A much better strategy is to introduce the English spelling code explicitly, beginning with the
easiest, least ambiguous, and most frequently used parts of the code and then adding complexity
gradually. That is the central strategy on which this program is based.


The strategy adopted in this program is the same strategy that successful coaches use when
teaching children a sport such as tennis. The successful coach does not ask students to learn
“Whole Tennis” and soak up the necessary skills all at once by trying to hit all different kinds of
shots the first day on the court. Instead, the successful coach teaches the student to hit a forehand
ground stroke and provides lots of practice hitting forehands. Then the coach moves on to teach


Appendix A: Overview of the Skills Strand
**213**


**214**



a backhand ground stroke, then a forehand volley, then a backhand volley, then a serve, then an
overhead smash, then a drop shot, etc. With each element taught, the student becomes a stronger
and more complete player. In the same way, this program begins by teaching the most common and
least ambiguous spellings for sounds and then moves on to introduce the more complex parts of the
writing system.


~~**KEY ASPECTS OF THE SKILLS STRAND**~~


Some key aspects of the Skills Strand are listed below.


 - This program teaches reading and writing in tandem, since they are inverse processes. English
writing involves making pictures of sounds; reading involves translating those pictures back into
sounds and blending the sounds to make words.


 - This program includes explicit, systematic phonic instruction in which students are taught target
skills needed to independently decode and encode words.


 - This program explicitly teaches letter-sound correspondences as opposed to leaving students to
figure these out on their own or deduce them by analyzing familiar whole words (as in some forms of
“analytic” phonics).


 - This program focuses on sounds, or phonemes, as the primary organizing principle of the program,
rather than letters.


 - This program focuses consistently on the phoneme, or single sound, and not on larger units.
Students learn to read words that contain onsets, rimes, and consonant clusters, but they learn to
view and process these larger units as combinations of smaller phoneme-level units. Rimes like _–ick_
and initial clusters like _st–_ are not taught as units but as combinations.


 - This program uses a synthetic phonics approach that teaches students to read by blending through
the whole word; it does not teach multiple cueing strategies, use of pictures as a primary resource in
decoding, or part-word guessing.


 - This program begins by teaching the most common or least ambiguous spelling for a sound (the
basic code spelling); later it teaches spelling alternatives for sounds that can be spelled several
different ways. Thus, the system is kept simple at first, and complexity is added bit by bit as students
gain confidence and automatize their reading and writing skills.


 - This program includes words, phrases, and stories for students to read and activity pages for them to
complete that allow for focused, distributed practice working with the letter-sound correspondences
they have been taught.


 - This program does not require students to read words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have learned. In other words, all words students are asked to read as
part of the program are decodable, either because they are composed entirely of letter-sound


Foundational Skills 1


correspondences students have been taught or because they are Tricky Words that have been
taught. This means students have a chance to begin reading words and stories that are completely
decodable before tackling words and stories that are full of spelling alternatives.


  - This program does not require students to write words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have been taught. In other words, students are only asked to write words that
can be spelled (at least plausibly if not always correctly) using the code knowledge they have been
taught.


  - This program carefully controls the introduction of Tricky Words and words with ambiguous or rare
spellings, preferring to have students learn to read and write with regular words that can be blended
and spelled by the letter-sound correspondences taught.


  - High-frequency words compiled from a research-based list for Grade 3 are also taught as they appear
in the unit Readers. They are revisited frequently to build automaticity and fluency.


  - This program avoids letter names because what is important for reading is not the letter name but
the sound value the letter stands for. To read the word _cat_, it is essential to know /k/ /a/ /t/, not “see
aay tee.”


~~**THE BASIC AND ADVANCED CODE**~~


The program teaches the highly complex letter-sound correspondences of the English language
in an explicit and systematic manner in Kindergarten–Grade 3. Students are taught how the 26
letters (or graphemes) of the alphabet are used in various combinations to represent 44 sounds (or
phonemes). There are approximately 150 different spellings for these sounds.


Students are first taught the basic code for each of the 44 phonemes. The basic code spelling for
a sound is usually the most common, or the least ambiguous, spelling for a sound. By learning
these letter-sound correspondences first, students experience a high degree of predictability, and
therefore success, in decoding words with these spellings.


Basic code spellings may be single letters, such as these spellings and sounds: ‘a’ > /a/, ‘e’ > /e/,
‘b’ > /b/, and ‘m’ > /m/. Basic code spellings may also include digraphs, or two letters to represent
a sound, such as ‘ee’ > /ee/, ‘oy’ > /oi/, ‘ou’ > /ow/, ‘sh’ > /sh/, and ‘th’ > /th/. Other basic code
spellings include separated digraphs, such as ‘a_e’ > /ae/, and ‘o_e’ > /oe/.


The advanced code consists of all other spelling alternatives (over 100) that may be used to spell
the 44 phonemes in English. Examples of alternative spellings include ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘ss’ > /s/, ‘c’

 - /s/, ‘g’ > /j/, ‘ay’ > /ae/, and ‘ey’ > /ee/. Some of these spelling alternatives occur relatively
frequently in the English language, while others are quite rare. See the provided charts for the basic
and advanced code.

~~**TRICKY WORDS**~~


The term _Tricky Word_ is used in this program to refer to a word that does not “play by the rules” of
spelling and/or pronunciation. Examples of Tricky Words include _one_, _said_, _of_, _were_, and _have_ .


You can describe the trickiness of a Tricky Word like _said_ in two ways. If you think about it from a
spelling point of view, you might say that the word _said_ is tricky because the sound /e/ is not spelled
with an ‘e,’ as you might expect it would be. On the other hand, if you think about it from a reading
point of view, you might say the word is tricky because the letters ‘ai’ are not pronounced /ae/, as
you might expect they would be. Either way you look at it, _said_ is a Tricky Word.


But notice that the word is not completely irregular, either. The first letter and the last letter are
pronounced exactly as you would expect. It is only the second and third letters, representing the
vowel sound, that are not sounded as you would expect. Or, if you prefer to look at things from the
speller’s perspective, you might say the first and last sound are spelled just as you would expect; it
is only the middle sound—the vowel sound—that is spelled irregularly. This is the case with many
Tricky Words: most of them have a regular part (or parts) and then a tricky part. More often than
not, you will find that the tricky part involves the vowel sound and its spelling.


When you are asked to teach a Tricky Word, the guidelines in the Teacher Guide will generally prompt
you to begin by reminding students that not all words play by the rules and words that do not play
by the rules are called Tricky Words. Next, the Teacher Guide will generally suggest that you write
the Tricky Word on the board. You may wish to ask a student to read the word as he or she thinks it
might be sounded (i.e., to blend according to the normal procedures). Alternatively, you can read the
Tricky Word that way yourself. Then you can point out how the word is actually pronounced. Once
you have established the actual pronunciation, you can point out and/or discuss what is regular and
what is irregular about the word. Most Tricky Words have at least some parts pronounced exactly the
way you would expect. For example, as noted above, the first and last letter in _said_ are pronounced
just as one would expect. After discussing the regular parts, you should then draw attention to the
tricky part (or parts) of the word, pointing out letters not pronounced as one might expect they
would be (e.g., the ‘ai’ in _said_ ). This is the part of the word that students just have to remember.


By drawing attention to the regular as well as the irregular parts of the word, you teach students
that Tricky Words are only partial exceptions to the normal rules of reading and writing. (They are
not so much irregular as they are a little less regular than most words.) There are some parts of the
word spelled just as you would expect and also pronounced just as you would expect. Then there are
some others that are not. There is a subtle but important difference between teaching Tricky Words
this way and teaching them as single entities that have to be memorized as wholes, as if every part
of the word were unpredictable.


Foundational Skills 1


Note that some Tricky Words are actually part of spelling patterns. For example, the words _he_, _she_,
_we_, _be_, and _me_ are taught as Tricky Words in earlier grades because it is hard to write stories without
them. However, once the ‘e’ spelling alternative for /ee/ is taught, these Tricky Words can be seen
as part of a larger pattern that includes words like _replay_ and _prefix_ . Other Tricky Words, such as
_one_ and _of_, remain tricky even when most of the spelling alternatives have been taught. By Grade 3,
students have been taught the majority of the code knowledge needed to decode most words in the
English language. As such, there is less of an emphasis on Tricky Words in the Grade 3 program.


~~**SIGHT WORDS AND TRICKY WORDS**~~


One of the most common terms in the world of reading instruction is _sight word_ . Unfortunately, this
is also a rather ambiguous and potentially confusing term. Educators use the term _sight word_ in
two different senses. For some people, sight words are high-frequency words that students need to
encounter frequently and learn to decode rapidly and effortlessly. Other people use the term _sight_
_word_ in a more restrictive sense, to refer to words that cannot be sounded out using letter-sound
correspondences and may need to be taught as exceptions.


In this program, we define these terms as follows:


  - A Tricky Word is a word that does not play by the rules. It is a word containing at least one part that
cannot be read correctly via blending or cannot be spelled correctly using the code knowledge taught
so far.


  - A sight word is a high-frequency word that we want students to see many, many times and learn to
read quickly and eventually learn to recognize rapidly.


The main difference here is that a Tricky Word always contains some irregular element, whereas a
sight word might or might not.


There is considerable overlap between the two categories (which is probably why the two senses of
_sight word_ are regularly confused). Some words qualify as sight words because they are used a lot
and also as Tricky Words because they are not pronounced (or written) as you would expect. These
are words that are both irregular (and therefore hard to read and write, at least at first) and also very
common (and therefore important for student success). They are candidates for special instruction,
and many of them are given special instruction in this program.


Tricky Words do not qualify as sight words on most lists because they are not especially common.
Words of this sort are sprinkled throughout the language but do not receive much attention because
they are only used occasionally. Students can learn them as the need arises in upper grades.

~~**CUSTOMIZING AND ADAPTING THE PROGRAM**~~


This is a highly structured and sequenced program. We are unapologetic about that, as we believe
the structure and sequence will be very helpful to students as they work to learn the English spelling
code. However, this is not a scripted program in which teachers are required to read the manual and
give one of a handful of approved responses. We expect—indeed, we hope—teachers will tweak the
phrasing and come up with ways to customize, personalize, and adapt the instruction.


Our goal has been to put things in a logical order and provide all the guidance and support
necessary for a new teacher, or a teacher new to this kind of phonics instruction.


At the same time, we believe there is room for experienced and creative teachers to customize
and adapt the program. Indeed, some of the exercises included in this version of the program were
developed by teachers in our pilot programs!


Sometimes in the lessons, we give exact phrasing that we suggest you use; more often, however, we
give indirect phrasing and/or encourage you to explain something using your own words. You should
feel free to make changes to the phrasing. For example, you may prefer to speak of “a picture of a
sound” or a “spelling.” Later in the year, you may want to teach the term _digraph_, or you may prefer
to refer to the letters in a digraph as a “letter team” or as “buddy letters.” There are many ways to
customize the program and the language while preserving the basic instructional principles and
sequence of instruction.


For the presentation of words, you may write on a chalkboard, a whiteboard, chart paper, an
overhead projector, a document camera, or the projection system of your choice. A projection
system works especially well for activity pages since it allows the teacher to model the task exactly
as the students will be completing it. You may use a pocket chart, a magnetic board with magnetic
letters, an overhead projector with letters cut from a transparency, or a smart board. Many
modifications of this sort can be made without adversely impacting the quality of the instruction.


You should also always feel free to add additional activities and activity pages that are consistent
with our philosophy of instruction. You should always feel free to respond to the teachable moment,
even if it leads you slightly off the path laid out in the Teacher Guide.


There are only a handful of things you should not do:


You should not skip a lesson in which new code knowledge is taught. If you do, students will lack
important code knowledge, untaught spellings will begin to appear in their word lists and on their
activity pages, and the lessons will start to make less sense to them.


For the same reasons, you should not reorder the lessons. The program relies heavily on sequencing,
and instruction will be confused and less effective if the lessons are reordered.


Foundational Skills 1


~~**SMALL-GROUP WORK**~~


Large parts of this program have been written for whole-group instruction, but the program can be
customized to allow for small-group instruction of various kinds. You will note that there are Support
and Challenge sidebars sprinkled throughout the lessons that will guide you in how to differentiate
instruction for your students, while still using the whole-class approach described in the lessons.


Since some students will learn the new information right away while others will need more practice,
you may wish to do small-group work to follow up the initial introduction of code knowledge. You will
note that many lessons do include suggestions for small groups; you should feel free to adapt these
and other lessons as best meets the needs of your students. We have seen this program taught very
effectively in small groups and in workstations students visit on rotation.


~~**ADJUSTING THE SPEED OF INSTRUCTION**~~


This sequence will work for most children. However, all children are different, and all classrooms are
different. Some classrooms may need more time to master concepts than others. The program has
been designed so the pace of instruction can be adjusted as needed.


The most important thing for you to know is that you can pause at any point in the program.
If students are not learning the material, simply stop where you are and do additional work to
accelerate or reteach as needed. All lessons contain some materials you can use if you pause.


In addition, at the end of each unit there is a “Pausing Point.” If the end-of-unit assessment or your
observations suggest some members of the class need additional time to master the concepts
taught in the unit, this is an especially good place to stop and provide additional practice and
review. The Teacher Guides include additional work at each Pausing Point. They will typically provide
enough for at least 1–2 days of additional work. The materials provided in the Pausing Point can be
used in various ways. Sometimes you may wish to have all students do the same activity or activity
page. At other times you may wish to work individually or in small groups with students who are
struggling with a particular concept.


To slow down instruction, you can pause either in the middle of a unit or at a Pausing Point. We do
not recommend that you attempt to speed up the sequence of instruction. The program lays out an
ambitious program of instruction.


The Grade 3 program of instruction should work well for a wide range of students. You should begin
with the assumption that the Grade 3 program is an appropriate option for all students in the class.


Inevitably, however, there will be differences in learning. Students learn at different rates. Some
students will pick up the material quickly; others will have more difficulty. There are many strategies


Appendix A: Overview of the Skills Strand
**221**


**222**



for dealing with this. In general, we encourage you to try to keep most of the class together if it
makes sense. It is much easier to teach one set of students at roughly the same level than it is to
teach two or three groups at very different levels.


If you find some students are lagging, you may still be able to keep the class together for the main
lessons but find extra time two to four times a week to work with those students who seem to need
extra practice.


If this is not sufficient, you may eventually need to regroup some students. As we note in Lessons
4–5 of this unit, it is especially important to administer the placement assessment to all students at
the start of the year. We strongly recommend that teachers then use an “across grade” approach to
grouping students. If there are two classrooms, these two teachers should look at all of the Grade 3
students in both classrooms and consider regrouping students for Skills instruction only, with one
teacher taking the class of students who need review and more practice, while the other teacher
works with those students ready to move on to Grade 3 Skills instruction. It will likely be worthwhile
to reconvene at multiple times during the year to plan across the grade level, using the end-of-unit
assessments. In this way, students in need of acceleration can be moved to the appropriate group,
while students who are making progress can advance.

**Appendix C:**
Using Chunking to Decode
Multisyllable Words

Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught will enable students to read onesyllable words with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences is no
guarantee that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllabic words. To this
end, most students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk, and read
parts of words—syllables—to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can then
be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated, and students are expected
to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, the program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the easiest
two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is already a
familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In addition, each
syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing, hunt·er, bust·ed_ ). The
dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain double-letter
spellings for consonants, in this program, the divider is typically placed after the double-letter
spelling rather than between the two consonants (e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers that are
familiar with other ways to chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is done, however,
because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single-spelling units since kindergarten
(‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.). The program strives to be consistent in representing these
spellings in the way that the students have been taught to process them (e.g., as whole entities
for a sound). (Ultimately, as students become more proficient at decoding and chunking syllables
through subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually chunk and decode
these words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding these two-syllable
words consisting of root words and suffixes relatively easy.


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable words.


Foundational Skills 1


To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


**• Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound (e.g.,**
/ **a** / **,** / **e** / **,** / **i** / **,** / **o** / **,** / **u** / **):** ~~_let_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_pad_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_rod_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_tin_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_fun_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_pic·nic_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_un·til_~~


**• Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g.,** / **ae** / **,** / **ee** / **,** /
**ie** / **,** / **oe** / **,** / **ue** / **):** ~~_cake_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_home_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_like_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_mule_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_Pete_~~ ~~,~~ _mis·_ ~~_take_~~ ~~,~~ _stam·_ ~~_pede_~~


**• Vowel Digraph Syllables:** ~~_joint_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_speak_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_proud_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_play_~~ ~~,~~ _dis·_ ~~_may_~~ ~~,~~ _be·_ ~~_low_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_coun·_~~ _sel_


**• R-Controlled Syllables:** ~~_art_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_curb_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_girl_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_fort_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_clerk_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_tur·_~~ _nip_, ~~_ar·_~~ _tist_, _fe·_ ~~_ver_~~


**• Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g.,** / **ae** / **,** / **ee** / **,** / **ie** / **,**
/ **oe** / **,** / **ue** / **):** ~~_go_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_me_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_hi_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_a·_~~ _pron_, ~~_f·_~~ _nal_, _com·_ ~~_pre·_~~ _hend_


**• Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·_ ~~_ple_~~ ~~,~~ _puz·_ ~~_zle_~~ ~~,~~ _raf·_ ~~_fe_~~ ~~,~~ _ca·_ ~~_ble_~~ ~~,~~ _ri·_ ~~_fe_~~


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


**• Schwa Syllables:** _ben·_ ~~_e·_~~ _fit_, _ap·_ ~~_pe·_~~ _tite_, ~~_a·_~~ _bout_, _hos·pit·_ ~~_al_~~ ~~,~~ ~~_e·_~~ _mo·tion_


Note: The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately because
of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


To decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these names. The names of the
syllable types are provided here only to establish a common vocabulary for teachers as they use
the materials. What is necessary, however, for students to become fluent readers of longer words in
increasingly complex text is that they be able to visually parse certain spelling patterns as syllable
chunks so they can quickly and easily decode each syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.


Appendix C: Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words
**233**


_ad·mit_ _nap·kin_ t _rum·pet_


For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed after
the double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is because the
double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units since kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’

- /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).


_traff·ic_ _muff·in_ _happ·en_


When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.


_mon·ster_ _con·tract_ _pil·grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read
the first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model
for students how to blend the two syllables aloud:







**234**



In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the magic
‘E’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for closed
syllables:


_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


In Grades 2 and 3, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to use


Foundational Skills 1


a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying each
possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:


_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_









However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There is
no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be flexible
and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to determine
whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. To recognize whether a
word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has heard before
(i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent an additional
challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a second language.


If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:


Appendix C: Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words
**235**


_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is straightforward.


When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings
in the words.


_ban · gle_ _twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_









**236**



Foundational Skills 1


In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings represent
the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a combination of
stressed and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed or weakly
stressed, its vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that linguists call
a schwa. This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’
and ‘tion’. Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite challenging for
many students.


Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the
schwa sound has a particular spelling:


_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is a schwa syllable, but it is identified separately
because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables
accordingly throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness_ _help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten–Grade
3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.

In order for the ELL to meet grade-level learning expectations<br>across foundation and enrichment curriculum, all instruction delivered in English must be linguistically accommodated<br>(communicated, sequenced, and scaffolded) commensurate with the student’s level of English language proficiency. For<br>Kindergarten and Grade 1, certain of these student expectations do not apply until the student has reached the stage of<br>generating original written text using a standard writing system. The student is expected to:|
|ELPS 5.A|learn relationships between sounds and letters of the<br>English language to represent sounds when writing in<br>English;|p. 26|
|ELPS 5.B|write using newly acquired basic vocabulary and<br>content-based grade-level vocabulary;|p. 106, p. 112|
|ELPS 5.C|spell familiar English words with increasing accuracy,<br>and employ English spelling patterns and rules with<br>increasing accuracy as more English is acquired;|p. 26, p. 71, p. 81, p. 88|
|ELPS 5.D|edit writing for standard grammar and usage, including<br>subject-verb agreement, pronoun agreement, and<br>appropriate verb tenses commensurate with grade-<br>level expectations as more English is acquired;||
|ELPS 5.E|employ increasingly complex grammatical structures<br>in content area writing commensurate with grade-level<br>expectations, such as: (i) using correct verbs, tenses,<br>and pronouns/antecedents; (ii) using possessive case<br>(apostrophe ‘s’) correctly; and (iii) using negatives and<br>contractions correctly;|p. 14, p. 20|
|ELPS 5.F|write using a variety of grade-appropriate sentence<br>lengths, patterns, and connecting words to combine<br>phrases, clauses, and sentences in increasingly<br>accurate ways as more English is acquired; and||
|ELPS 5.G|narrate, describe, and explain with increasing<br>specificity and detail to fulfill content area writing<br>needs as more English is acquired.||
