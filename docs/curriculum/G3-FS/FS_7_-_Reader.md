### **Introduction**

Do you know about the heroes that walk
among us? You may not notice them because
they don’t wear capes, fly through the air,
or shoot webs to catch lawbreakers. But this
doesn’t make the work they do any less heroic.



1


These heroes are even better than
superheroes from movies or books because
they’re real, and they live in our communities.
These brave people quickly come to the
rescue in an emergency. They are firefighters,
**paramedics**, and police officers.


Firefighters, paramedics, and police
officers are also known as first responders.
They’re the first people we call when there’s
an emergency, fire, or community problem.
Let’s learn more about **first responders** and
their vital work to protect our communities.

**Chapter**
### **Paramedics**
# **1**

**The First Paramedics**


We all know that emergencies can
happen anywhere. Until a few decades ago
in the United States, however, there was no
emergency care system outside hospitals.


People in many communities live far away
from hospitals. Some people are alone when
they get hurt or sick, or they can’t drive to
see a doctor. These **awful** situations are why
paramedics are so important.



4

6


How did the job of a paramedic come to
be? President Lyndon B. Johnson received a
haunting report in 1966. The report showed
that a high number of people were dying each
year from accidental injuries and that there
needed to be a system of **standard** emergency
medical care. The people in charge of that
emergency medical care would be trained
paramedics.


Paramedics would receive training on how
to provide medical care to people outside
hospitals. Paramedics would assist people
who were choking or having a heart attack.
They could deliver babies and treat **physical**
**traumas**, such as broken bones. Establishing
such a system seemed **daunting**, but it soon
became a reality.



7


**Hospitals on Wheels**


Paramedics show up to help people during
emergencies, arriving in ambulances that are
hospitals on wheels. The ambulance is where
a paramedic can provide **vital** critical care
to a patient before they reach the hospital.
Ambulances today have **awe-inspiring** tools
such as **defibrillators** to restart hearts, oxygen
for people who struggle to breathe, and splints
to set broken bones. This technology is a
dramatic shift from the emergency care that
people received in the past.


**Constant Communication**


Paramedics must always stay in contact
with each other and with hospitals to share
important information about the people they
treat. The paramedics and the hospital staff
must work as a team.



8


Constant communication prepares the
medical staff to help the patient quickly
when the ambulance arrives. This system
of communication is called the **Emergency**
**Communication System**, or ECS.



9


Think about how phones, computers,
and video games have advanced. You can
imagine how much ECS has changed since it
began in the 1960s. Paramedics struggled to
relay crucial information to hospitals using
only basic radios. They now use the internet
to update medical information about the
patient, such as heart rate, oxygen levels, and
temperature, before they even arrive at the
hospital.


Hospital teams can also know the exact
location of the ambulance using the **Global**
**Positioning System**, or GPS. GPS is a system
that uses satellites to detect where objects and
people are. This technology is critical during
an emergency. Medical teams at the hospital
can know when the patient will arrive.



10


The ambulance driver can also use GPS
to find the fastest way to the hospital by
avoiding traffic and roadblocks.




12


Paramedics can also use computer
programs to send details about their patients
to hospital staff. Computer programs are a
faster and almost **flawless** way to transfer
information using photos and videos rather
than audio. This allows hospitals to prepare
for the patient and not have to pause for
this information when they arrive. It can
also let the paramedics know that the
hospital doesn’t have the right equipment
to treat the patient, so they can go to
another hospital if needed. Paramedics
can use advanced technology to locate
people who need emergency care and to
respond to emergencies more quickly. It is
truly awesome how advanced the tools for
communication have become.



13


**The Life of a Paramedic**


Paramedics often work a **shift** that can last
anywhere from 24 to 48 hours. Emergencies
can occur around the clock, so a team of
paramedics must always be ready to help. Most
paramedics work **overtime** or on weekends
because of these emergencies.


For the first 12 hours of a 24-hour shift, the
paramedic is the first responder who answers
911 calls and drives patients to the hospital.


The paramedic can shower and sleep during
the next 12 hours of the shift but are still
considered “on-call.” Being on-call means that
if they are needed, they must return to work.
Some paramedics living near the base station
can return home to sleep. If they live too far
outside the station, there is a “sleep house” in
or next to the station where they can rest.



14


15


Paramedics begin their shift by preparing
the ambulance. They ensure that all the
equipment is working and that the ambulance
has all the necessary supplies. They take
care of chores at the station if there are no
emergency calls. They also discuss how to
handle emergencies and learn from each other.


When paramedics get a 911 call, they
quickly drive to the scene and **assess** their
**surroundings** . The first ten minutes after
an accident are the most important. The
paramedics must use their powerful skills in
emergency care to consider how to treat the
patient without losing any time. They might
perform CPR if the patient needs it. CPR is
a way to revive someone who isn’t breathing.
The most important job of the paramedic is
to help the patient reach a **stable** state where
they are breathing and able to be moved.



16


Then, they must get the patient to the
hospital as quickly as possible, where they will
get the necessary care.




Paramedics are essential for keeping us
safe. They are skilled professionals providing
critical, life-saving services. Their ability to
quickly assess and respond to emergencies
makes a difference in helping patients survive.
We owe our gratitude to these everyday heroes
for their dedication to their challenging work.

**Chapter**
### **Firefghters**
# **2**

**The First Firefighters**


Firefighters are brave heroes in our
communities. Not only are they trained
to fight fires, but many are also trained
paramedics. A firefighter is often the first to
respond to an emergency: fires, accidents, or
even spills of **poisonous** liquids. The work
of a firefighter and a paramedic can overlap.
A paramedic has more medical training than
most firefighters but doesn’t rescue people
from fires like a firefighter would. They are
both employed as first responders at the scene
of an emergency.



20


21


22


Firefighting has a rich history. The earliest
firefighters were regular community members
who volunteered to put out fires in **ancient**
Rome. These groups, called “bucket brigades,”
**deployed** buckets of water to put out fires.


European towns appointed community
members as fire wardens starting in the
1500s. These early firefighters patrolled,
prevented, and put out fires.


People realized they needed a more
organized fire-fighting system as cities grew.
The Great Fire of London swept through
the city in 1666, destroying thousands of
businesses, houses, and historic buildings.
In response, Sir Christopher Wren suggested
creating the first official firefighting teams
in London. Firefighting also became a paid
profession around this time.



23


The horse-drawn fire engine was invented in
the 1800s so firefighters could respond faster to
emergencies. Steam-powered pumps also became
more widely used, making putting out fires
quicker and easier. Firefighters started receiving
special training to be part of a fire brigade (or



24


fire department) by the 20th century. They
also started to use masks to help them breathe
when they entered a building filled with smoke.
Firefighters began to also help with various
medical emergencies by the mid-1900s.




**Firefighting Technology Today**


The tools used by firefighters have changed
dramatically over the years.


Firefighters today use state-of-the-art
equipment, such as **thermal** cameras, to
detect fires. Thermal cameras allow firefighters
to locate fires, even when they are voyaging
through smoke-filled areas **devoid** of light.
These thermal cameras are often attached to
firefighters’ helmets or masks, leaving their
hands free to carry people out of buildings.


**Drones** provide images of fires from above.
Firefighters can use this information to plan
how to put out the fire, monitor its path, and
assess safety.



26


27


28


Each firefighter wears a **Personal Alert**
**Safety System** or PASS device. The PASS
device lets out a loud alarm if the firefighter
doesn’t move for a while, allowing other
firefighters to respond. The firefighter
can receive prompt medical care and get
treated quickly for injuries by wearing the
PASS. These communication devices can
withstand the broiling temperatures of big
fires. Firefighters also wear fire-resistant suits,
gloves, and helmets that protect them from
extreme heat.



29


Modern fire trucks have new tools,
too, such as systems that allow firefighters to
control the flow and mix of water and foam.
This allows them to fight different kinds of
fires. They also use pumps to deliver water
with great force, helping put out fires high up
or far away. Some fire trucks even have robotic
systems that operators can control from a
distance. These robots can enter dangerous
environments in place of humans.


**Wildland Firefighters**


Some firefighters work in nature
fighting wildfires. They are called **wildland**
**firefighters** .



30


31


Wildland firefighters use tools like shovels,
rakes, and chainsaws to create lines in the dirt
that stop wildfires from spreading. It’s not
unusual to see a wildland firefighter flying
a plane over a fire to drop water and special
chemicals from above. Wildland firefighters
work in **harsh** conditions and must wear
full-body, heat-resistant suits. They are the
first responders to protect communities from
harmful wildfires that can spread **quickly** . It’s
plain to see how vital these heroes are.


**A Day in the Life of a Firefighter**


A firefighter’s main shift is 24 or 48 hours
long, like the shift of a paramedic. The day
starts around 6 a.m. at the fire station with
a loud alarm ringing. Firefighters put on
their essential gear. They meet as a group to
participate in drills, allowing them to practice
their skills as they put out fires and help people
flee danger.



32


33


Firefighters have to be alert and in
peak condition during their shifts. The
emergency alarm can go off at any time,
and once it goes off, they must hurry
to attend to the emergency. Firefighters
will rush to the fire engine and drive to
the emergency site as quickly as possible.
The siren’s wail alerts other cars that the
fire truck must pass so they can arrive at
the scene fast. Some firefighters called
“smoke jumpers” even ride in planes and
parachute into remote areas to put out
fires.


Firefighters quickly assess the situation
once they arrive at the scene. They use
their thermal cameras to guide them.
They wear fire-resistant gear to beat the
extreme heat of the flames. If people are
in danger, the firefighters will go into the
smoke and flames to rescue them.



34


35


Firefighters are usually off duty for 48
hours after a 24-hour shift, but they are still
on-call and must report to work if needed.


Firefighters are real-life heroes who risk
their lives to save others. It’s certainly a
challenging feat. Firefighters have saved
countless people from fires and other
emergencies.

**Chapter**
### **Police Offcers**
# **3**

**The First Police Officers**


Paramedics and firefighters are important
real-life heroes who protect people during
fires and medical emergencies. But who steps
in to help solve community problems? That’s
the police officers. They serve and protect our
communities.


Every community has laws to keep people
safe. These laws show us how to treat each
other respectfully and live peacefully. Police
officers teach us about the laws we must
follow and help to **enforce** them. They watch
over the community and help people solve
problems.



38


In the United States, police officers are
the first people present when there is a
problem or a **dispute** . They are responsible
for assessing the scene and ensuring everyone
is safe. They have an enormous responsibility
and face many risks to protect us.




Police officers have been part of
communities for a long time. The idea
of a police force began in ancient Egypt
and Rome when groups of people came
together to keep order and catch lawbreakers.
Watchmen walked the streets of medieval
English towns at night to ensure everyone
was safe. **Constables** —or local police—
helped to keep order and take care of regional
disputes in growing communities in early
America. **Sheriffs** are another type of police
officer. The word _sheriff_ comes from an old
word that means king’s representative. The
first sheriffs were in charge of keeping the
peace in one area of the kingdom. In the
United States, they maintained law and



40


order as the nation expanded toward the
West.




The modern police force was born in
London in the 1800s. Police officers there
were called “ **bobbies**,” named after Sir
Robert Peel, the prime minister of the United
Kingdom, who created the city’s new police
service. Peel’s famous saying was, “The police
are the public, and the public are the police.”
Peel believed that the police were there to
serve and protect the community. This idea is
very close to our understanding of the role of
the police officer today.



42


43


44


**Protecting the Community**


Police play many roles in our communities.
They are partners who work with city leaders
to design community programs. They
also direct traffic and help with everyday
problems, like finding lost items or resolving
disputes.


Police officers visit schools and teach
students how to follow laws. They may teach
them about traffic laws and bicycle safety.
Students often get the chance to ask the
police officers questions. Older students may
even join a youth auxiliary or youth police
academy, where they can learn more about the
work police officers do.



45


Some police officers connect with
communities by coaching local sports teams.
They also help older community members
by checking on them at home or bringing
them warm meals. Police also work with
community leaders on events like toy drives or
holiday parties.



46


47


48


A police officer’s job includes talking to
different people in the community to solve
problems. Take a small car accident, or fender
bender, as an example. An officer talks to the
drivers and anyone who saw what happened,
known as witnesses. The information from
witnesses helps the officer learn more about
the accident. Officers are trained to be kind
and careful when talking to witnesses. Officers
also look for clues, like broken car pieces, to
better understand accidents. Doing this work
helps prevent future accidents and teaches
everyone to follow safety rules.


Police officers are also on the scene when
there is a crime. If someone steals from a store
or gets into a fight, police officers help to
catch the person or people who committed
the crime and help others who might have
been hurt or who witnessed it.



49


50


51


52


Each day involves patrolling the streets
by car, bike, or foot—or sometimes even by
horse if it’s **feasible** ! Patrolling is a way to
keep a watchful eye on what’s going on in the
community and to be visible and noticeable
on the streets. A police officer’s presence
allows them to be ready to lend a helping
hand as needed.



53


Another part of the day may include
visiting schools or community events. An
essential part of a police officer’s job is getting
to know the people in the community. They
might join neighborhood watch meetings,
conduct safety workshops, or speak to
students at a school about how to stay safe.


At any point throughout the day, a police
officer must be ready to quickly respond to
possible radio alerts that signal a call for help.
People call on the police for many different
reasons. Once the officers arrive on the scene,
they make sure that everyone is safe before
investigating what happened.



54


55


Officers patrol the streets after dark to keep
us safe while we sleep. There are always police
officers ready to help.


Police officers may wear uniforms and
badges instead of capes, but they are **genuine**
heroes.


Paramedics, firefighters, and police officers
are essential to keeping communities safe and
peaceful. They are the first responders who
help us in emergencies, often risking their
own lives to keep us safe. The next time you
see one of these heroes, make sure you thank
them for all they do.

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully leveled
in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.

The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
forty-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many
spellings can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to
make early reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of
the available spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out
as part of their phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been
deliberately introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if
they are assigned at the proper time.

As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.


TRICKY WORDS:


accidental, breathe, patient, temperature, ancient, unusual, patrolling


**Code Knowledge added gradually in the unit for this Reader:**


  - Decode multisyllabic words with the diphthongs _aw, ou,_ and _oi_ .

  - Spell homophones with the pattern _a_e, ai, ee,_ and _ea_ .

  - Identify, use, and explain the meaning of homophones and homographs.


  - Identify the meaning of and use words with the suffixes – _able_, – _ible_, and _–ish_ .
