# **Welcome!**
## **Grade 3, Unit 2** **Foundational Skills**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will continue learning the VCV syllable-division pattern. Students will use context to determine the

meaning of multiple-meaning words, followed by a deeper look at multisyllabic words with open syllables.


**What** **will** **my** **student** **learn?**

Students will first work on encoding and decoding multisyllabic words that follow the VCV pattern and have open

syllables. To enhance reading comprehension, students will examine multiple-meaning words and use context to

determine the meaning. Students will be introduced to affixes with the _–ed_ and _–ing_ suffixes. The Reader for this unit is

_A_ _Talk_ _with_ _Animals_, which tells the story of Annie, who, along with her family, embarks on a safari to explore the vast

savanna. Through her adventures, Annie reflects on the lessons she’s learned about wildlife, survival, and the

importance of understanding and respecting nature. In third grade, students are expected to write neatly in cursive,

using correct letter formation and leaving space between words.
