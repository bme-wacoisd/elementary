**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 2. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. Teachers will explain these activity
pages to the students orally, using the instructions in the Teacher Guide. There are also instructions
on the activity pages for students to read themselves. The Activity Book is a student component,
which means each student should have an Activity Book.

###### **Open Syllables**


Dear Family Member,

Your student is learning the VCV syllable pattern: V (vowel) C
(consonant) V (vowel). For example, the word raven has two
vowel sounds, so the word has two syllables.

In the following chart, look at the images and read the words.
Separate each word into syllables, writing each syllable in the
appropriate column. Circle the open syllable.

Feel free to practice the VCV syllable pattern with your
student while visiting the grocery store. Ask your student to
identify the VCV and ask how many syllables are in each word.
Examples may include: banana, potato, lemon, and melon.

|Col1|Col2|Syllable 1|Syllable 2|
|---|---|---|---|
||**minor**|**mi**|**nor**|
||**unite**|||

In a small town, three friends, Mia, Alex, and Sam, found a

how adventures could bring them closer
together.


“It’s the little things that us,” Mia said,

###### **Use Context to Determine Word Meaning**


Read the excerpt from _A Talk with Animals_ . Read the
dictionary entries for three words found in the text. Answer
each prompt. Write neatly in cursive, leaving spaces
between words.


Annie checked her animal fact book for one detail. She did not
relent in her search for facts. “My book says ostriches do not fly. Is
that true? Why do you have feathers if you do not fly?”


Olivia ruffled her feathers in protest. “Feathers are used for more
than flying. Ostrich feathers help with body heat and balance. Body
feathers impact body heat, and tail feathers help with balance when
running.” Olivia continued, “Ostriches have feathers like other birds,
but the purpose of the feathers differs. While other birds use feathers
to fly, ostriches use them for running.”


**balance** (noun): the state of being in a stable position or the
ability to stay upright without falling
**balance** (verb): adjusting the weight or position of something so
that it does not fall


**running** (verb): (1) moving swiftly or quickly;
(2) trying to get elected to a position in the government


**detail** (noun): (1) a small, specific part of something; (2) a
military unit assigned to a specific duty or mission
**detail** (verb): (1) to describe or report something with specifics;
(2) to clean and refurbish something

read this excerpt from the story aloud. Encourage your
student to focus on accuracy (reading the words correctly)
and fluency (reading the words smoothly). Ask your student

“What animals will we see? Will they get close to us? I have an
animal fact book to share with everyone!” Annie was so vocal about
the trip, talking as soon as they got in the car with the trip leader,
that her father laughed.


Her mother placed a hand on Annie’s head and said, “Relax,
Annie. Enjoy the view, or you might miss an animal.”


The car stopped, and the guide pointed to a huge dust cloud
ahead.


Annie said in a soft voice, “Please let it be a bunch of zebras.”


The guide told Annie, “Just wait to see what happens. You cannot
imagine how special it is here in the wild because there are things you
have never seen and will never see anywhere but here.”

**The Bicycle Trip**


Amari got a new bicycle for her birthday. The bicycle was a vibrant
orange and the wheels shined like silver. Amari loved it! She made it
a habit to ride it every day and everywhere. The bicycle had a basket
in front. Amari liked to keep snacks in the basket. Her favorite snack
was hazelnut chocolate candy bars.


It was a scorching sunny day during school vacation. Amari
decided to go exploring for a place to cool down. She hopped on her
bicycle. She had heard about a beautiful meadow just outside the
town. She hoped that a breezy open meadow would help to tame the
heat. Also, she had never been there and was curious to explore it.


Amari rode her bicycle through the town. Then she rode through
some woods. The shade from the trees gave her some relief. Just then,
a red squirrel darted across her path. She braked quickly. It dashed
down a hidden path. Amari turned and rode on the path. It led to the
meadow! In the middle of the meadow was a large hazelnut tree. The
squirrel was chomping on the hazelnuts that had fallen from the trees.
The squirrel looked happy to be filling his hungry belly.

Amari was excited. She parked her bicycle and ran to the tree.
The tree was full of hazelnuts! She could tell because they have a
tough brown shell on the outside that opens when they’re ready to eat.
The nut inside the shell is round and white and tastes sweet. Amari
thought, _These will make a great snack later!_ She filled her basket.
Then she got back on her bicycle and returned home.


At dinner that evening, Amari told her family about her amazing
day. She shared her hazelnuts with everyone. Dad salted and roasted
some then added them to a salad. Mom blended them with chocolate
powder to make a spread for toast. They were delicious! For the rest
of her vacation, Amari continued to visit the meadow and collect
hazelnuts.
