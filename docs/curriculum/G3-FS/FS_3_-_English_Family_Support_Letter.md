# **Welcome!**
## **Grade 3, Unit 3** **Foundational Skills**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will practice reading and spelling words with the vowel-consonant-e (VCe) pattern.


**What** **will** **my** **student** **learn?**


Students will learn how to read and spell words that have the vowel-consonant-e (VCe) spelling pattern. They will learn

that the final ‘e’ in these words often changes the pronunciation of the preceding vowel, and they will practice this

concept using preceding vowels, such as: _a_e,_ _i_e,_ _o_e,_ and _u_e_ . Students will then learn to read and spell words with

suffixes that change the VCe base word by dropping the final ‘e’ _(_ e.g., _bake_ plus _–ing_ becomes _baking)_ . Students will also

practice reading with the Reader, _Healthy_ _Humans:_ _How_ _to_ _Keep_ _Your_ _Body_ _Strong._ The Reader educates children on the

importance of physical, mental, and social health in a holistic approach to well-being. It discusses the importance of

sleep, regular exercise, a balanced diet, hydration, personal hygiene, and dental care. The Reader also addresses the

positive impacts of expressing emotions, building friendships, and experiencing social interactions.
