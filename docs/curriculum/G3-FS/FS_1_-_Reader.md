### **Introduction:** **Friday Stories**

“Everyone join me down at the firepit!”
our camp leader Jen sang out. We were so
eager we almost jumped from our seats. It was
Friday night. Even Jack, the pickiest eater in
the group, cleaned his dinner plate without
grumbling on Friday nights. It was the night
when we didn’t bother to check the time.
Instead, we watched our shadows sink into the
ground. We shared stories around the campfire
past our bedtime, marshmallows dripping
from sticks onto our shirts. The stories always
changed. There were stories of whales that used
soap. There were stories of singing chipmunks.



1


The sky turned a dark shade of purple in
Texas’s Big Thicket National Preserve. The first
stars began to appear. We ran to the firepit. As
we ran, we searched the ground for long sticks
to roast our marshmallows.


“I win!” Matteo shouted, holding up a thin,
knobby branch.


“It’s not a race,” Sadie said as she looked for
her own branch.


Winnie and Asha were a few steps back. “I
wonder what the theme of tonight’s story time
will be,” Winnie said.


“Whatever it is, I hope the stories aren’t
scary again,” Asha said. She shivered a little
bit, thinking about the frightening stories they
shared at the campfire the Friday before.



2


“Argh!” Jack yelled, jumping in front of
the two girls. “I hope the theme is pirates!” he
smiled.

We finally reached the firepit. Jen was
waiting with a fresh bag of marshmallows at
her side. Matteo sat on a rock next to Winnie
on one side of the firepit. Asha, Sadie, and Jack
sat on the other side. It was so quiet. We could
hear the wind in the trees.


“Welcome,” Jen began, just like every Friday
night, “to Friday campfire stories. The theme
for tonight is . . .”


We moved to the edge of our seats. We
hung on Jen’s every word.


“Family stories.”


We were all puzzled.


“Family stories? What’s a family story?”
Matteo asked.



5


“Is it like a family tree but where you tell
stories about each family member?” Sadie
asked.


Jen smiled. “Good guess. A family story
is a story passed down by a family member.
I will share a story my grandmother told me
when I was a little girl. Before I begin, does
everyone remember the rules we created for
listening during story time?”


“Don’t talk over the storyteller,” Winnie
said.


“Don’t talk to other friends during the
story,” said Jack.


“Don’t make fun of someone’s story,” Asha
said.


“Remember that everyone’s story is
important to them,” said Sadie.



6


Jen beamed . “Good work, campers! I think
we’re ready to start . The story I’m going to
share takes place in Poland, the country where
my grandmother grew up .”

**Chapter**
### **Jen’s Story:** **“The Golden Peach”**
# **1**

“Once, in the middle of a forest in Poland,
a peach tree grew with the most enchanting
golden peaches. A wish would be granted to
anyone who ate one of the peaches.


“Outside the forest, rain had not fallen for
many months. The ground was cracked and
the crops **withered** . Food was hard to come
by. People in the town no longer ate big plates
of meat for dinner. The children didn’t drink
tall glasses of milk. Instead, they ate a few
small pieces of bread each day. They drank
from the creek, but it was drying up.



9


10


“Everyone’s bellies rumbled with hunger.
The hunger would attack them most at night
while trying to sleep. The children **sulked** and
cried. Some had heard the tale of the tree with
the magical peaches. They were waiting for the
peaches to ripen in the fall.


“One very **bright** girl named Kat wanted
to find the peach tree herself. When the leaves
began to change color, she made a plan. She
waited until the sun was high in the sky,
quietly went into the forest, and **embarked**
on her quest. As Kat went deeper and deeper
into the woods, she could hear whispering in
the trees. She stopped to listen. The trees were
whispering tales of the peach tree’s power!
Woodland animals helped her find her way
along the path.



11


“Finally, she reached the golden peach tree.
It matched all of the stories she had heard
about it. Its branches hung with enchanting
fruit shining in the sunlight. She fidgeted as
she thought, wanting to make the most of this
gift. Then she finally made her wish. Instead
of being greedy and wishing for something for
herself, Kat wished no one in the town would
ever go hungry again.”


“As soon as she made her wish, the wind
picked up. A great storm churned in the sky.
Rain showered the fields for the first time
in four months. It fell on all of the crops
that had been drying up. Vegetables, wheat,
heaping servings of meat, and sandwiches
filled everyone’s plate. Everyone ate and ate
until they were full.



12


13


“Kat brought a big basket of peaches to
share with all the other children in the town.
Thanks to her kindness, no one in the town
would suffer from hunger again.”


“Is there anything we can learn from the
story of the golden peach?” Jen asked.


We all munched on our s’mores as we
thought about the story’s lesson.


“Always be kind and share with others,”
Sadie said. She saw Jack’s marshmallow fall to
the ground and get smudged with dirt. She
nudged his arm, passing him the one on her
stick so he could make his s’more.


“That’s right! My grandmother told me that
story when I was a kid. She wanted me to learn
to be kind and give back to others like Kat,”
Jen said.



14


“Now, who would like to go next?”


The night was quiet while we thought about
our family stories.


“Me! I’ll go!” said Matteo.



15


**Chapter**
### **Matteo’s Story:**

**“Melody of the Desert”**
# **2**

“When my brother and I visit my uncle in
Mexico, he tells us this story. He’s tough on us
but gives great advice.”


“Once upon a time, a small cactus named
Melody lived in the desert. Melody had a gift.
Whenever the wind whispered through the
desert, Melody burst into song. Everyone in
the desert wondered about the **phantom** song
rising over the sand.



16


“One day, a wise old tortoise named
Pedro and a playful jackrabbit named Lola
discovered Melody’s enchanting music. They




“Lola and Pedro told everyone about
Melody’s gift of a beautiful voice. Soon, desert
animals of all shapes and sizes traveled to listen
to her sing every night under the moonlit sky.


“A raven named Rascal grew jealous of
Melody’s songs. He wanted to steal her gift
and fill the night sky with his own music.
One night, he tried to sneak over and pluck
all Melody’s needles while she was sleeping.
He would fly away **triumphant**, knowing she
could not sing without her needles.


“Lola, the jackrabbit, saw him before he
could complete his plan. She jumped quickly
through the desert, leading Rascal on a wild
chase after her. Melody awoke and sang as
Rascal flew through the air.



18


19


20


“Her voice was so **soothing** that Rascal
forgot about the chase and his jealousy. He
began to glide through the sky, listening to the
music. He was tired and felt ashamed for being
so jealous.


“Rascal landed on the ground next to
Melody. Pedro, the tortoise, walked over
to him. ‘There’s no need to be jealous,’ the
tortoise said. ‘Everyone has their talents.
Melody can sing, but you can soar through the
sky.’ Rascal thought for a moment and began
to laugh. Pedro was right. Not every animal
could fly like he could. The tortoise couldn’t
fly, but he could carry his home on his back.
Lola, the jackrabbit, couldn’t fly, but she could
run and hop very fast. Every animal had their
special gift.”


Matteo finished. He looked at the faces of
the other campers in the firelight.



21


“That was a great story, Matteo!” Asha
piped up.


Matteo smiled.


“Does anyone know the lesson of Matteo’s
story?” Jen asked.


“We all have our special gifts,” Jack said.
“Like my gift of pretending to be a pirate!” He
waved his stick in the air. The marshmallow
on it flew over the campers and into a tree.
“Oops,” he said.


“Who is our next volunteer?” Jen asked.


“Me!” Sadie shouted.



22


23


**Chapter**
### **Sadie’s Story:** **“The Clever Rabbit”**
# **3**

“This is a story my grandfather tells me
when it’s past my bedtime, and he wants me
to sleep.” Sadie laughed. “I never want to
sleep . . . so he tells this story a lot!”


“In the African **grasslands**, there lived
a clever rabbit named Kwame. Kwame was
known for his sharp mind. He was smart and
**persistent**, ready to overcome any problem
that came his way. One summer, a **drought**
swept across the land. The animals became
very thirsty. The plants withered and died.



24


25


26


“Kwame decided to find a solution, no
matter what. He wouldn’t **resign** himself to
watching his friends and family suffer. He
visited the wise snake, Amina. He found her
resting on the branch of a large **baobab tree** .


“Kwame explained that rain had not fallen
for many weeks. He told Amina the animals
were weak from thirst. Amina shared her wise
words: ‘With hardship comes opportunity.’


“‘This is just one moment. One knob on
the large branch of the baobab tree,’ she said.
‘You must not think of it as forever.’


“With these words in mind, Kwame got to
work. He designed a plan to solve the problem.



27


“He called all of the animals to a meeting.
He explained they would work together to dig
wells deep in the ground to bring water to the
land.


“As they worked, Kwame saw a group of
elephants passing by. He had an idea. He asked
the elephants to help the animals reach the
water beneath the ground. The elephants were
impressed by Kwame’s plan. They joined the
effort, using their strong tusks to dig deeper
wells.


“Word of Kwame’s plan spread, and soon
the once-parched land became dotted with
wells where the animals could find cool, clean
water. They were proud of their hard work.
They had aligned their forces to do what they
had thought was impossible. Kwame the clever
rabbit became well known for his leadership.”



28


29


30


“That’s a great story!” Jen said. “Does
anyone know the lesson from Sadie’s story?”


“The animals worked together. But they
also needed a leader to show them the way,”
Winnie said.


“That’s right,” Asha said. “Kwame didn’t
give up. He worked really hard and learned
hard times can be opportunities for making the
world better.”


“Smart thinking, girls!” Jen said. “Now,
who would like to go next?”


“Can I go?” Asha asked shyly.


“Of course!” Jen called out.



31


**Chapter**
### **Asha’s Story:**
##### **“The Distracted Boy”**
# **4**

“This is a story my great-aunt tells us
during family parties.”


“Once upon a time, there was a very
distracted boy named Arjun. Instead of doing
his chores, he would stay in bed. He often sat
at the window, daydreaming. He was so lost
in his imagination he sometimes forgot to
eat or drink. His parents were puzzled. Even
when they asked him to help with an easy
task, they knew it would not get done.



32


“Arjun’s parents needed help. They
could not understand why he was always so
distracted.”



33


34


“One morning, Arjun’s mother noticed a leak
in one of the rooms. She knew Arjun had the
day off from school. ‘Arjun!’ she called. ‘Since
you have the day off, and we will be working all
day, can you fix this leak? Here is some **caulk** to
fix it. Knead the caulk over the hole, and let it
dry.’


“She explained the task in great detail so
Arjun wouldn’t forget. But Arjun was distracted
while she was speaking.


“Soon, she left. Arjun tried to remember what
his mother had told him to do, but he couldn’t.
He went downstairs and looked out the window
at the flowers and birds. The birds pursued each
other, flying back and forth around the fruit
trees. He watched the garden and daydreamed
for hours. Soon, he grew sleepy.



35


“Suddenly, he noticed there was water
rushing around his feet. He jumped up, scared.
A flood was coming down the staircase toward
the chair where he was sitting.


“He began to cry for help. A group of
neighbors with buckets came and helped him
dump the water outside, but it was too late.
The small leak his mother had shown him had
grown into a large crack, and the burst pipe
had flooded the entire house.


“Arjun knew what he had to do. He worked
after school and on weekends. He saved all
his money to help repair the house. He had
learned his lesson. He would never again let
his daydreaming get in the way of things he
was trusted to do. He would be careful, pay
attention, and work hard.”



36


37


Everyone looked thoughtful.


“I understand, Arjun,” said Matteo. “I
daydream a lot, too.”


“I don’t think there’s anything wrong with
daydreaming,” said Jen. “As long as you also
take care of your work and take responsibility
for your actions.”


“I think I know the lesson for that one,”
Jack smiled. “Beware of leaks!”


Everyone laughed.


“I think it’s also about making sure you’re
taking care of the most important tasks first
and not getting distracted,” Asha added.



38


“That’s such a great lesson. Thanks for
sharing, Asha!” Jen said, smiling. “Jack, would
you like to go next?”


“Sure,” said Jack.



39


**Chapter**
### **Jack’s Story:** **“The Selfsh Deer”**
# **5**

“This is a story my aunt and uncle told me
when I visited them last summer.”


“Once upon a time, there was a selfish
deer named Luna. If an animal tried to speak
to Luna, she ignored them. If anyone asked
her for help, Luna would walk away. She only
cared about herself.


“One day, Luna was walking through a
meadow to the river. She wanted to spend a
few hours admiring her stunning reflection in
the water. On the way, she heard a bird’s sharp
cry coming from a bush.



40


“As she got closer, she noticed a small
bird with a broken wing on the ground next
to the bush. The bird was crying out and was
very much in pain. ‘Help me!’ the bird called
to her. ‘Please lift me, and put me in the nest
above you. I will repay you for your selfless
act.’ Luna looked up and saw a nest just above
her head.



41


“‘Sorry, I’m busy,’ Luna said. She hurried on
toward the river to see her fantastic reflection.


“As she walked away, the bird kept calling
out for help. The sound echoed through the
forest, but Luna paid no attention to it.


“Luna spent hours at the river, looking at
her face in the water. She felt sleepy when she
suddenly realized the sun was already setting.
She jumped up in fear, wondering how to find
her way home in the darkness.


“The forest was full of dangerous shapes
and sounds. Luna’s happy mood turned to
fear. The sounds of the trees scared her. The
darkness seemed to get darker as she moved
deeper into the forest. ‘Help me!’ she cried, but
no one responded.



42


“She had never helped them, so why would
they help her now, in her time of need?



43


“‘Help me!’ she cried again. This time, she
heard a small voice call out in the darkness.
‘Follow my song!’ it said. It let out a sharp
trill, and then another, and another. Luna
followed the sound until she made her way
out of the forest and found the path home.
She could see a bird in the moonlight. It had
a hard time flying because of an injured wing.
She saw it was the same bird that had asked
her for help earlier that day. She had ignored
the bird because she wanted to look at her
own reflection. Luna felt awful about how she
had treated the bird and vowed to change her
ways.


“From that point on, Luna helped every
animal she could.



44


“She had grown from a selfish deer to a
selfless helper because of the caring bird who
helped her in her time of need.”



45


“What a fantastic lesson!” said Jen.


“The same thing that happened to Luna
happened to me,” Asha said. “My older sister
fell and hurt herself, but I was so busy playing
I didn’t even ask if she was okay. Later that
day, I fell, and she insisted on helping me
up. She showed me what it means to care for
someone. It made me think of how selfish I
had been.”


“These things happen,” Jen said. “The
important thing is to learn from our mistakes
and act differently the next time.”


Stars glittered in the sky. Matteo let out a
big yawn. He had a habit of yawning near the
end of story time on Fridays.


“I think we still have one more story to
listen to,” Jen said. “Unless we’re too tired and
ready to finish.”



46


“No!” we all shouted.


Jen laughed. “Okay. Winnie, I think it’s
your turn.”


Winnie looked unsure. “I’m not sure I can
remember all of it,” she said, “but I’ll try.”



47


**Chapter**
### **Winnie’s Story:**

**“The Brave Little Fish”**
# **6**

“This is a story my mother tells me.”


“Once upon a time, there was a little fish
named Mei. Mei lived in a little river in the
south of China. A large rushing waterfall
bordered a little river that led to a bigger river
with pure, clear water. On the other side of
the river was a dock where many people would
come to catch fish to sell at the market.



48


49


50


“Mei’s home was near the middle of the
river. It was not too close to the waterfall’s
currents and not too close to the dock and
the fishermen. Mei became very bored with
swimming back and forth in her tiny part of
the river. She longed for the freedom to swim
past the limits of her corner and into the deep
water on the other side of the waterfall, but she
was too afraid.


“‘I’m too small,’ Mei thought to herself,
shaking with fear. ‘I’ll be thrown out of the
water and onto a rock.’ So she stayed in her
spot and grew more bored each day.



51


“One day, another small fish named Li
joined her. She wasn’t sure where he was from,
but he had shining scales like hers. He chased
her playfully to the edge of her part of the
river and kept going, almost to the waterfall’s
edge. ‘Come on!’ he shouted. Mei stopped. She
didn’t want to be **candid** with him and admit
she was afraid. ‘There are many more fish like
you and me on the other side!’ he called out.


“Mei was shocked. She thought she was
the only fish like herself in the entire river.
She realized she knew nothing outside of her
small part of water. Why did she want to keep
swimming in the same small pool of water
every day? There was a whole world to explore
on the other side of the waterfall. Mei knew
she had to face her fears.



52


53


54


“‘Come on, you can do it!’ Li shouted
with **encouragement** . And for the first time,
Mei believed it. She swam through the hectic
current, the roaring water, and the waterfall.
Nothing had changed other than the fact that
she believed in herself. And, of course, she had
made a friend.


“Mei went on to make many friends. She
relished chasing them through the clear water
of her new home. She was not bored anymore.
Every day, she found a different corner of the
river to explore. The best part was that Mei was
no longer afraid of anything in the river. She
had become so brave, she even helped other
small fish travel over the waterfall, just like Li
had helped her.”



55


We sat quietly, looking at the stars, as
Winnie finished her story.


“I wish I were as brave as Mei,” Sadie
whispered.


“You are brave, Sadie!” Winnie said. “We
all are. It takes a lot of bravery to share a story
with everyone. Especially when the story is
important to you.”


“That’s true. You all shared wonderful
stories with important lessons,” said Jen.
“Lessons about sharing, listening, and treating
others with respect.”


“And about golden peaches, singing
cactuses, and brave fish,” said Asha, smiling.



56


57


58


We were all sleepy. We had eaten too many
marshmallows.


“Time to put out the fire,” Jen said. We
groaned.


“Until next time,” Matteo said as he helped
Sadie **dump** water over the flames.


The wind in the trees blended with our
footsteps as we headed back to our cabins. We
all dreamed that night about the stories we
had heard.

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully leveled
in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.

The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
approximately 40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and
many spellings can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed
to make early reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of
the available spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out
as part of their phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been
deliberately introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if
they are assigned at the proper time.

As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings, and
other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader accompanies.


TRICKY WORDS:


baobab, caulk, desert, drought, encouragement, flooded, pirates, solution, tortoise


HIGH-FREQUENCY WORDS:


night, about, tree, story, thought, every, began, hard, important, river, small, near


**Code Knowledge added gradually in the unit for this Reader:**


  - Decoding single-syllable and multisyllabic words with the following digraphs: _wh, sh, th_
(including voiced and unvoiced), _ng, nk_ (including _ang, ing, ong, ung, ank, ink, onk, unk_ ).
