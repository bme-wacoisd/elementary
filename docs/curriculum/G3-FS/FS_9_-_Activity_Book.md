**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 9. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. Teachers will explain these activity
pages to the students orally, using the instructions in the Teacher Guide. There are also instructions
on the activity pages for students to read themselves. The Activity Book is a student component,
which means each student should have an Activity Book.

**Synonyms and Antonyms**


Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students have learned about synonyms
(words with the same meaning) and antonyms (words
with the opposite meaning). Ask students to share with
you any words that are synonyms and words that are
antonyms. Ask your student to think of times they have
used synonyms or antonyms when they speak or write in
order to show importance or vary their vocabulary. In this
activity, students will read the sentence and change the
underlined words with a synonym and antonym to match
each underlined word. Write the new words in a sentence
next to synonyms and antonyms. Write neatly in cursive,
leaving spaces between words.


Example:


The freezing wind blew through the trees.


Synonym:
###### **The chilly wind blew through the trees.**


Antonym:
###### **The hot wind blew through the trees.**

###### **Adding Prefix non–, im– or Suffix –ful**


Dear Family Member,


Your student has been learning about prefixes and suffixes.
They have learned about the prefix _non_ - meaning ‘not’ and
_im_ - meaning ‘into’ or ‘not’ and the suffix – _ful_ that means ‘full
of or able to.’ Have your student complete each word in the
table below with either a prefix or suffix. When finished, have
them sketch a picture below each word to show its meaning.
Challenge your student to look for words with prefixes and
suffixes in the stories they are reading, on billboards when
driving, or in other text they come across in everyday life.

**Use Context to Define Unfamiliar Words**


Dear Family Member,


Your students have been learning about how to determine
the meaning of unfamiliar words using context clues.
In class, students learned about stopping to notice an
unfamiliar word, rereading the sentence, paying close
attention to the word, using words around it to help, making
educated guesses, and asking if it makes sense. For this
take-home activity, students should gather different forms
of text: cookbooks, mail, magazines, letters, or books. Then,
students should skim the text searching for unfamiliar
words. Have students write the unfamiliar words they find
and then have them write what the word means on the
line under it. Talk about how you know that is the correct
meaning as a family. Write neatly in cursive, leaving spaces
between words.


Example:


Unfamiliar Word:
### **quart**

Meaning:
##### **a way to measure liquid; a quarter of a gallon**

Read aloud the text below.

###### **Sweet Treats**


In the town of Sweetville, there was a magical candy store
named Sugar Delights. All the children and adults in the town
went there when they wanted some sweet treats. The store was very
large. It seemed to go on forever, filled with an endless selection of
candies, chocolates, and lollipops.

Ravi, Bo, and Rina were best friends who lived in Sweetville.
Today, they wanted to visit the candy store after school. As they
entered the store, they immediately smelled caramel and chocolate.
Their mouths watered with excitement. Their eyes grew large as
they saw big and small jars filled with every candy you could think
of. They saw colorful candy wrappers. They saw lollipops in every
flavor.

As the friends walked around, they heard something near the
gumball machine. They walked over to the machine. They saw two
big, naughty, magical gummy bear brothers, Buzzy and Wiggly,
fighting over who could grab the most gumballs from the machine.
They were arguing so loudly that everyone in the store started to
notice them.

Ravi, Bo, and Rina knew they had to do something. Instead

of yelling at the gummy bears to stop, they decided to turn the
situation into a game. “Why don’t you both try to grab as many
candies as you can in one minute?” Rina suggested with an excited
smile.

The gummy bears agreed. Ravi found bags for them, and Bo set
a timer. Buzzy and Wiggly started grabbing candies and dropping
them into their bags. Everyone cheered for them. Laughter filled
the store.

When the timer buzzed, the gummy bears counted their
candies. Surprisingly, they each had the same amount! The friends
and the entire store erupted in applause. The gummy bears noticed
the joy they had spread and replied with grateful smiles.

The store owner gave Buzzy and Wiggly a special bag of
rainbow candies to share. The gummy bears learned that working
together brought more joy than fighting ever could. As the friends
left Sugar Delights, the store owner gave each of them a bag of
candies to thank them for their help.
