#### **Chapter Voyage to the** **Library**
# **1**

Lily loved **gazing** at the night sky. She
looked up with her big, bright eyes at the
stars above. She wondered what it was like to
go to space. Lily thought about an article she
had read in a magazine about **astronauts** who
work at NASA. They go to work each day and
learn the skills they need to travel to space.
She wondered about flying in space and what
it would be like to see a star up close. She
couldn’t stop thinking about what else was
in space and hoped to one day visit NASA in
Houston, Texas, to see real astronauts.


Lily was sitting on her porch one clear
summer evening. She gazed at the sky and saw
the moon and a few **shimmering** stars. She



1


didn’t know much about space yet, but she
knew there was so much to discover out
there.


Lily was still thinking about the stars and
space when she ate breakfast with her dad the
next morning.


“Dad, can you take me to the library?”
Lily asked.


“I can’t go this morning, but we can go in
the afternoon,” her dad said.


“Great! Thanks, Dad!”


Lily and her dad went to the library that
afternoon. Lily needed help finding the books
she was looking for, so she asked the librarian.


“Ms. Lopez, I would like to learn more
about space. Can you help me find books
about space?” Lily asked.



2


“Sure, Lily. There’s an astronomy shelf in
the science section. Astronomy is the study of
space,” Ms. Lopez answered.



3


Lily found books about the planets,
stars, and universe. She learned the universe
includes everything, including all living
things, dust clouds, galaxies, light, planets,
and stars. She picked a book with a cool
picture of a **galaxy** on the cover. Lily’s
excitement grew as she started reading. She
learned about the different **constellations**, or
groups of stars, seen from Earth. These were
the stars that Lily loved to look at each night!


“Look, Dad! There’s so much about space
to learn! I’m so excited to read these books!”
Lily exclaimed.


She learned a group of stars is called a
galaxy, and Earth’s galaxy is called the Milky
Way. The Milky Way contains over 100
billion stars! The Milky Way is like a river of
stars in the night sky. It’s an **enormous** galaxy,
like a big city of stars and planets.



4


Lily’s home, Earth, is one of those planets.
She learned that the Milky Way is so massive
that it would take a spaceship millions and
millions of years to travel from one side to the
other. Like Earth’s sun, it’s full of stars, and
many have planets.



5


6


Lily told her dad, “When we look up
at the night sky, we see a tiny piece of our
amazing Milky Way galaxy!”


Lily also learned about Earth’s corner
of the Milky Way. She read about the solar
system and the planets that orbit the sun. She
read about the sun, the star that lights up our
world. It’s a gigantic ball of hot, glowing gas.
It provides the light and warmth that allows
life to thrive on Earth.


Lily marveled at the sun’s power. She
explained to her dad that the sun is like a
giant, super-bright light bulb in the sky. This
light bulb is bright because it contains very
hot gasses.


Lily learned the sun is the source of energy
for everything on Earth. Without the sun,
people wouldn’t have the food, light, and
warmth they need to live and grow.



7


The sunlight makes it warm on Earth,
like a cozy blanket. This warmth is essential
because it helps support life.


Plants, like the ones in a garden or the
trees in a park, use this sunlight to make their
food through **photosynthesis** .


When animals, including people, eat
plants, they get the energy from the sun’s light
that the plants store. They indirectly eat the
sun’s energy through the plants.


Lily exclaimed, “The sun is like our
biggest, most important friend in the sky!”

**Chapter**
#### **Orbiting the Sun**
# **2**

Lily continued to visit the library to learn
more about space. Her dad brought her three
weekends in a row!


Lily learned that the sun is like the big
star in the center of a cosmic dance floor, and
planets in the solar system move through space
like dancers. The “dancers” twirl while moving
around the sun. Each planet has a path called
an orbit. They’re like toy hoops in space. These
hoops keep the planets from getting too close
to or far from the sun. The closer a planet is
to the sun, the faster it has to dance to stay in
**orbit** . It’s like a game of musical chairs, but,
instead of chairs, there are orbits.



10


11


The moon orbits around Earth as the
planets orbit the sun. Lily thought of the
moon as Earth’s friend. The moon takes a path
in the sky like a stretched-out, oval-shaped
loop. The moon is closer to Earth sometimes,
and other times, it’s a bit farther away. It
takes the moon about 27 days to finish going
around the Earth. **Gravity** keeps the moon
moving around the Earth. It’s like the string
that keeps a kite from flying away. The moon’s
gravity also pulls on the Earth, causing the
water to shift and create low and high tides.


The amount of the moon that is visible
from Earth changes during its orbit. The moon
sometimes looks like a bright round plate in
the sky, and other times, it’s just a **sliver** . This
is because the sun’s light shines on it from
different angles. This causes the different phases
of the moon. If the sun did not shine its light
on the moon from different angles, then the
moon would always look the same.



12


13


Ms. Lopez helped Lily learn about many
of the planets in the solar system. She learned
Earth is the third planet from the sun in the
solar system.


Lily also learned that Mercury is the closest
planet to the sun. It has **scorching** days and
freezing nights. Venus is sometimes called
Earth’s “sister planet” because it’s similar to
Earth in size. It is the hottest planet in the solar
system, rotates backward, and has no moons.
Mars is the Red Planet because it looks red. It
has the largest volcano in the solar system, and
there is some water there! Jupiter is the largest
planet in the solar system. It features a giant,
swirling storm called the Great Red Spot.


Lily also learned about her favorite planet,
Saturn. Saturn is known for its unique rings,
and it has more than 80 moons.



14


15


**Chapter**
#### **Black Holes**
# **3**

Lily didn’t just learn about Earth’s galaxy. She
also learned about nebulae, clouds of gas and
dust in space. Some **nebulae** are so long and
thin, they look like cables or flexible objects.


Lily also read about how a star begins, and
how, in the end, it turns into a **black hole** .
A black hole is a place in space where gravity
pulls so much that even light can’t get out.
When objects get too close to a black hole,
they stretch out really long and thin, like
spaghetti! A single black hole can be billions of
times larger than the Earth’s sun. This process
takes a long time and only happens to really
big stars. A star has to be at least 20 times
bigger than the sun to turn into a black hole!



16


“Wow,” thought Lily. “What would it be
like to be in a black hole? I bet my friends
don’t know about black holes. They’ll be so
surprised!”



17


18



Lily started to wonder how people knew
so much about space. How did scientists
discover black holes? How do they know what
they’re like?


Lily went back to Ms. Lopez to ask another
question. She asked, “How do scientists study
black holes?”


Ms. Lopez found a book from the Space
Center in Houston all about black holes. She
pointed to the book’s table of contents. Ms.
Lopez found a section all about how scientists
study black holes. Black holes do not give
off any light, so scientists struggle to observe
them directly. According to the book, the
NASA scientists use powerful **telescopes** to
discover the mysteries of black holes. Using
a telescope enables them to look at how
the black holes affect nearby objects. They
look at what the black holes do to nearby
objects instead. For example, if they find stars
orbiting an invisible object, that object is


19


20


Lily asked her dad and her brother, Ted, to
act out the planets orbiting around the sun.


“We’ll dance like the planets orbiting
around the sun!” Lily laughed.


“Don’t fall down!” exclaimed her dad when
Ted got dizzy.


“You better catch me if I fall!” cried Ted.


Lily said, “We aren’t done yet! Let’s pretend
Ted is a black hole!” Lily and Dad moved
toward her brother like gravity was pulling
them. They giggled together as Ted tried to
wiggle away.



21


**Chapter**
#### **Comets**
# **4**

Lily continued her space education. She
was surprised to learn comets are amazing
icy objects from far away in the solar system.
They have bright, glowing heads like big, icy
balls. Comets have long, glowing tails that
can be seen in the night sky when they get
close to the sun. Up close, comets look like
dirty snowballs flying through space, but the
trickle of dust and gas from their tails creates
a beautiful sight. Comets can get bright and
shiny when they get closer to the sun. Comets
can have different colors, from white to blue
or even green, like cosmic fireworks.



22


Lily hoped to see a comet sparkle and
twinkle like a star in the night sky someday.



23


People like Lily have been interested in space
throughout history. A scientist who studies space
is called an **astronomer** . Studying comets helps
astronomers understand the solar system. They
work hard to find patterns in how comets and
other objects journey through space.


Lily learned about one astronomer named
Maria Mitchell. Maria Mitchell was the first
woman to be an astronomer in the United
States. One night in 1847, she was looking
through her telescope on the roof of her
father’s house. Looking for comets became
the focal point of her stargazing. She saw
something unusual in the sky. She observed
it carefully. She realized it was a brand-new
comet! Her discovery was a big deal. Comets
are rare and not easy to find. They named
the comet “Miss Mitchell’s Comet” in her
honor. People celebrated her locally and far
from home. She even won a gold medal from



24


25


#### **Chapter Meteors and** **Asteroids**
# **5**

Lily was excited to learn about **asteroids**
and **meteors**, fantastic objects that zoom
through space. Asteroids are like space rocks
that orbit the sun. Some are big. Some are
small. Some asteroids are tiny, like pebbles,
while others are as big as mountains. Asteroids
can have all kinds of shapes, like big space
potatoes or strange space diamonds.


Meteors are smaller pieces of asteroids that
enter Earth’s **atmosphere** . The word _meteor_
comes from the Greek meteōros, meaning
“high in the air.” The atmosphere is a layer
of gas that surrounds Earth. When several
meteors burn up, they create streaks of light
in the sky called meteor showers.



26


27


All the objects flying through space
**enchanted** Lily. Asteroids, comets, and
meteors were marvelous!


Lily soon realized she needed a telescope
to see the comets, planets, and stars up close.
She saved her allowance and, with the help
of her parents, got a small telescope. She set
it up in her backyard and started exploring
the night sky. Her favorite time was when her
dad joined her. They spent hours together,
stargazing and talking about the mysteries of
the universe.


“Look up there,” said Lily’s dad. “Those
stars are so bright!”


“I wish I could see a comet, Dad.” Lily
lamented.



28


29


**Chapter**
#### **Space Club**
# **6**

Lily wanted to share her love of space
with her friends at school. Her friend Max
suggested they start a Space Club.


The Space Club members decided to learn
more about space together.


Anita brought in a book about space
missions. Anita said, “It’s like an incredible
adventure when you journey beyond Earth’s
atmosphere and see the wonders of space.”


Max **pondered** what it was like to go
on a space mission. He thought about how
astronauts would need to think creatively to
solve problems in space.



30


Their friend David was amazed by the
wonders of space, such as the beginning of
stars and the dance of planets and galaxies.


Zara thought about the multiple scientists
who help on space missions. These scientists
have to work together to tackle critical
questions.



31


Lily brought her new telescope to the
Space Club.


“This is my telescope,” Lily said. “My dad
and I use it to see things far away, like the stars.”


“How does it work?” asked Anita.


Lily replied, “It’s really neat, but it’s
actually science! A telescope has two main
parts. The big lens in the front is called the
**objective lens** . The smaller lens in the back is
called the **eyepiece** .”


Lily explained, “The objective lens collects
lots of light from the thing you’re looking at,
like the moon, a star, or a planet. It bends that
light and brings it all together at one point.”


Max asked, “What happens next?”



32


“That’s where the eyepiece comes in! The
eyepiece is like a tiny magnifying glass. It takes
all the light that the big lens has collected and
makes it even bigger, so it looks like the thing
you’re looking at is closer than it is.”


Anita exclaimed, “Oh, I get it! So, the
telescope helps us see things bigger and closer.”



33


34


Lily replied, “Exactly! And that’s how
we can explore the night sky and see all the
amazing objects in space. Telescopes are like
our super cool space binoculars!”


Lily also explained that large space
telescopes have tentacle-like instruments that
capture light particles to reveal distant objects
in space. Those telescopes are more than four
times as powerful as hers!



35


**Chapter**
#### **Astronomers**
# **7**

Lily and the Space Club also learned
more about astronomers. Astronomers use
powerful telescopes to see **distant** galaxies.
It’s a joyful job for astronomers because
they get to explore the wonderful and vast
universe. Astronomers watch for changes in
the sky, always hoping to make meaningful
discoveries.


Lily and the Space Club also learned about
other famous astronomers and their incredible
accomplishments. Members of the Space Club
made presentations about an astronomer they
researched.



36


37


38


Zara started, “I’ll tell about Copernicus.”


She explained that Nicolaus Copernicus
had been a Polish astronomer. People used
to believe that the sun orbited the Earth. He
believed the universe is heliocentric, meaning
the Earth goes around the sun. This idea
helped people see the universe in a new way.
Copernicus increased our knowledge about
Earth and the stars and is well remembered in
the history of science.



39


David explained that Galileo Galilei
built upon Copernicus’s ideas. Galileo was
an incredibly successful scientist. One of
his big accomplishments was improving
the use of the telescope to look at the night
sky. He was careful in his observations and
discovered craters on the moon and four of
Jupiter’s moons. His discoveries confirmed
Copernicus’s **theory** that Earth was not the
center of the universe but orbited around
the sun. Galileo’s discoveries helped people
understand the universe better, and he is often
called the “father of modern science.”


Learning about these astronomers showed
the Space Club that scientists could make a
limitless number of discoveries about space. The
universe is so enormous and full of wonders.
Astronomers are fearless in their search for
knowledge and can always find more.



40


41


**Chapter**
#### **Astronauts**
# **8**

Lily and the Space Club also learned
about famous astronauts and their incredible
**accomplishments** . It takes a lot of planning
and training to be an astronaut, beginning
with their education. Astronauts need to
know a lot about engineering, science,
and math. They may learn to speak other
languages to talk with astronauts from other
countries. They have to be good at teamwork
and problem-solving. Astronauts work inside
and outside of the spaceship. Inside, they do
science **experiments** . Outside, they go on
spacewalks. During a spacewalk on the moon,
astronauts discovered they could hop very
high due to low gravity!



42


43


44


Max described Neil Armstrong’s life and
accomplishments. Max exclaimed, “He was
the first person to walk on the moon!”


On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong stepped
out of the Apollo 11 spacecraft on the moon.
He said, “That’s one small step for [a] man,
one giant leap for mankind.” David explained
that this was very meaningful. It showed
that humans could explore places far from
Earth. Neil Armstrong’s incredible journey
has inspired many kids to dream big about
exploring space.



45


Anita explained how Sally Ride became
the first American woman to travel to space in
1983. Sally Ride made history when she flew
on the space shuttle _Challenger_ . But that was
only the beginning. She also studied how to
prevent accidents in space.


“She makes me want to be an astronaut,
too,” said Anita.


The Space Club learned that Sally Ride
didn’t stop there. She returned to space again
and was later inducted into the National
Women’s Hall of Fame. She worked hard to
inspire young people to reach for the stars.
She showed that anyone can become an
astronaut and explore the universe.



46


Astronauts and astronomers both explore
space. Astronomers may not travel into
space, but they add to the understanding of
the universe, and their knowledge makes it
possible for astronauts to travel into space.
Astronauts and astronomers work together to
make the biggest discoveries!



47


**Chapter**
#### **Stargazing**
# **9**

The Space Club loved learning about many
impressive astronomers and astronauts, but
they were eager to see the stars and planets up
close. They decided to plan a stargazing night
at school.


Lily and her friends carried the telescope
onto the school’s lawn. Many parents and kids
from the town came to join them. Members
of the Space Club gave a short talk about the
stars, planets, and constellations. They passed
out copies of maps of stars, and they all took
turns looking through the telescope.



48


49


50


Lily pointed her telescope toward Saturn.
She spied the planet and invited everyone
to have a look. Everyone loved the **gas**
**giant** with its beautiful rings. Lily happily
explained what she knew about the planet
and its **stunning** rings.


Lily and her friends shared stories about
the asteroids, comets, meteors, planets,
and stars they had read about as the night
continued. They applied everything they
learned in the Space Club and felt like
astronauts on a grand adventure. They were
exploring the vast universe right from their
small town.


Anita spotted Venus. David showed
everyone how to adjust the telescope. Zara
pointed out different constellations. It was a
lot of fun.



51


When Lily saw a meteor blazing across the
sky, she excitedly cried, “Look, it’s a shooting
star! I mean, it’s a meteor!” Lily had never
been happier.


Lily knew that the night sky held endless
mysteries. She was excited to keep learning
about the wonders of astronomy. Her journey
among the stars had just begun. She knew
there was so much more to explore in the vast
universe.


Under the glittering stars and the moon’s
soft glow, Lily’s love for astronomy continued
to shine. She dreamed of exploring distant
galaxies. She also hoped to follow in the
footsteps of famous astronomers and astronauts.
This was just the beginning of her space story.



52


53


**Chapter**
#### **Looking to** **the Stars**
# **10**

The club members kept thinking about
their incredible stargazing adventure at the
next Space Club meeting. They thought
about all the asteroids, **comets**, galaxies,
planets, and stars.


Lily shared her plan to become an
astronomer when she grew up. She wanted to
spend her life understanding everything about
space. Lily was a big dreamer, but she was also
a careful planner. Lily studied what she would
have to do to be an astronomer. She planned
to visit a large space telescope to understand
what being an astronomer was like.



54


55


Anita said, “I’ll be an astronaut!” She
wanted to see the moon (and maybe Mars)
for herself. She applied to go to a special space
camp for kids. She was hoping to go this
summer.


David wanted to build **space shuttles** .
He loved taking things apart to see how they
worked and putting them back together.
Building space shuttles would be like a great
big puzzle!


Max was interested in working at
NASA (National Aeronautics and Space
Administration) in the space program. He
wanted to do the planning to make sure space
**missions** succeeded. Max wanted to be in the
action when a spaceship took off!



56


Zara said she wanted to write a book about
space to help other kids learn about space. She
was a great artist. She wanted to use her skills
as an artist to create dazzling pictures of space.


Lily was happy that her friends all found
space as interesting as she did. She knew there
was so much more to explore and was excited
to keep looking to the stars.

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully leveled
in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.

The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many spellings
can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to make early
reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of the available
spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out as part of their
phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been deliberately
introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if they are
assigned at the proper time.

As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings, and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.


TRICKY WORDS:


beautiful, diamond, done, journeys, knowledge, spaghetti, suggested, thought, through


**Code knowledge added gradually in the unit for this Reader:**


  - Decoding and forming contractions


  - Decoding and spelling multisyllabic words with consonant + _le_ syllables


  - Decoding words with suffixes - _ful_ and - _less_


  - Decoding words with suffixes that change the base word by dropping final ‘e’, doubling the final
consonant, or changing the “y” to “i”
