This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 8. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. Teachers will explain these activity
pages to the students orally, using the instructions in the Teacher Guide. There are also instructions
on the activity pages for students to read themselves. The Activity Book is a student component,

###### **Drawing and Writing Homophones**



**Take-Home**



Dear Family Member,


Your student has practiced using homophones. Discuss with
your student that homophones are words that sound the
same but have different meanings and are spelled differently.
Ask your student to go on a scavenger hunt around the house
or community and find their own examples of homophones
(stake/steak, bored/board). Have students write the
homophone, write a sentence using the homophone, and draw
an illustration of that example from their environment.






|Homophone|Sentence|Illustration|
|---|---|---|
|**board**|**My mom puts**<br>**important**<br>**papers on the**<br>**board in her**<br>**office.**||

###### **Read and Write: ai or ay**

Dear Family Member,


Your student has practiced words with ai and ay spellings.
Read the passage with _ai_ and _ay_ words for students to
practice fluency. Then answer the question in complete
sentences below. Write neatly in cursive, leaving spaces
between words.


It was a rainy Saturday afternoon. My family was complaining
because we could not go to the holiday parade. My brother decided
that we should have our own family parade indoors at the house
instead. My mom and dad grabbed instruments and passed them out
to all of us. We walked around the house at a snail’s pace and played
our instruments all afternoon. It was the best entertainment.


What does it mean to walk at a snail’s pace? Why do you
think the family walked around like that for their parade?

###### **Using Abbreviations**

Dear Family Member,

Your student has practiced using abbreviations this week.
Ask your student to read the following passage and explain
what an abbreviation is. Share any abbreviations that you
know that your student did not share.


The National Museum of the Pacific War is located in
Fredericksburg, TX. This museum was created to preserve and honor
the history of WWII, with a focus on individual stories of those
who impacted the war and served. Some of the features that the
museum covers are the different aspects of war, including technology
advancements, major battles, and the day-to-day life at the home
front. The museum’s goal is to educate visitors from all over about
the events of WWII and to ensure that those who served are never
forgotten.


Ask your student to fill out the right side of the table with the
abbreviations of the words listed.

###### **Fluency Assessment**

Read aloud the text below.

###### **Marco’s Family Trip**


It was the summer holiday. Marco’s family was going on a
vacation to explore a new state in the United States. They packed
their suitcases, and Marco made sure to bring his favorite hoodie,
which he threw in his bag. They went to the airport and boarded a
large plane. The plane zoomed through the sky, and Marco pressed
his nose against the window. He stared at the clouds below. He was
thrilled to be on his first plane ride ever!


After a smooth landing, they finally arrived at their destination.
Marco looked around as they drove to their hotel. He saw people
smiling and laughing everywhere. When he arrived at the hotel, he
smelled something delicious. There was a food festival on the street
outside his hotel. Marco was thrilled to explore all the new types
of food. The thought of it made his stomach grumble. Marco’s
eyes widened as he saw the colorful decorations and people playing
musical instruments. It was so impressive that he couldn’t contain his
excitement. He and his family quickly put their suitcases in their hotel
room and rushed back out to experience the tastes, smells, and sounds
of the festival.


As the sun set, Marco put his hands in his hoodie’s pockets. He felt
something mysterious. He took it out of his pocket and saw that it was

a postcard from his grandparents. They couldn’t come on the trip. The
postcard showed a picture of the moonlit sky with twinkling stars and
read, “Dear Marco, We miss you! Have fun exploring the world—it’s
beautiful and full of surprises. Enjoy your vacation! Love, Grandma and
Grandpa.”


Marco smiled at the thoughtful postcard. He decided to write his
grandparents a letter to share about his exciting adventure.


Dear Grandma and Grandpa,


Guess what? We went on a plane and landed in a place
with giant buildings! We went to a food festival, and the
food was yummy! I wish you were here, but I will see you
soon. I miss you lots!


Love,


Marco


Marco put the letter in an envelope with a stamp on the top
corner. He would mail it first thing in the morning the next day. As
Marco’s family continued to relish their vacation, Marco felt thankful
for his family and their adventures.
