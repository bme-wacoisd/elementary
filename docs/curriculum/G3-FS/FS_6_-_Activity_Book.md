**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 6. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. Teachers will explain these activity
pages to the students orally, using the instructions in the Teacher Guide. There are also instructions
on the activity pages for students to read themselves. The Activity Book is a student component,
which means each student should have an Activity Book.

One sunny afternoon, Zeke and Alex, two curious ten-year-olds,
decided they’d become space experts. Their class had just started learning
about space, and both boys were eager to show off what they knew.

“I’m going to learn all the planets,” Zeke said, flipping through
his book.

Alex wanted to go even bigger. “I want to learn about stars and
faraway galaxies,” he boasted.

When they started their project, Zeke got the planets mixed up.
“Is Mars before or after Jupiter?” he wondered aloud.

Alex tried to talk about light-years but got a bit tangled up. “Are
they, like, super far . . . or super fast?” he guessed, scratching his head.

After trying hard but getting some things wrong, the boys got
help from their teacher, Mrs. Clark, so they would understand better.
Walking out of class, Zeke was still excited.

“Space is trickier than I thought, but it’s awesome!”

Alex agreed, “Yeah! We just have to keep learning and maybe
watch some space shows. You’ll see. We’ll know everything soon.”

Even with the mix-ups, Zeke and Alex couldn’t wait to learn more
about space. They realized that discovering space wasn’t just about getting
facts straight, but about the fun and wonder in learning new things.

“If you’re into stars, I’ll ask my mom if you can come over tonight
to look at the constellations,” Zeke offered.

“And I’d love to learn more about the planets,” Alex replied.
“They’re so cool!”

##### **The Lost Key**



Your student has been practicing reading fluently at school.
Engage in this short play with your student. Pick a role, read,
and act out your lines! Then, you may switch roles, discuss
an alternative ending, or use props while acting out lines.
Tell your student they can practice fluency by incorporating
appropriate expression and intonation into their reading.
Encourage your student to vary their pitch, tone, and volume
to match the mood and meaning of the text. The sentences
in parenthesis are directions for the adult and the child.


Character 1: Adult


Character 2: Child


(Adult is searching around the room, looking concerned.)


**Adult:** (calling out) Have you seen my key anywhere? I can’t find
it! I don’t want us to be late to meet your friend at the airport.


(Child enters, looking puzzled.)


**Child:** Your key? No, I haven’t seen it. Where did you last have
it? Sometimes you leave it on the table by the front door, especially if
your hands are full!

**Child:** Look! Here it is! It fell behind the couch, between the
couch and the wall. Maybe we can put a bowl to hold the keys so that
they do not slip and slide off the table. We walk by this table often
and may bump into it unknowingly.


**Adult:** (relieved) Oh, thank you! I’m so glad you found it.


(They both smile, and Adult takes the key.)


**Adult:** (gratefully) I really like the idea of having something to
hold the keys. That is great problem solving! Thanks again!

Dear Family Member,


Your student has been learning about special word endings
that change how words are spelled and defined. Play this
game with your student for more practice.


Locate two dice to play. If you do not have dice, you may
choose to say aloud two random numbers from 1–6 instead.


1. Roll two dice.


2. Choose either a row or column that corresponds with
the numbers on the dice (if a 3 and 4 is rolled, the player
can go down column three and over to row 4).


3. Read the word in the box. Discuss the meaning of the
word and work together to identify the root word and
the suffix. Write a checkmark over the box to note that it
was read and defined.

##### **Fluency Assessment**

Read aloud the following text.

##### **Fluffy the Poodle**


Fluffy the poodle was the cutest and happiest poodle in the whole
neighborhood. Fluffy, who got his name because of his big, curly,
poofy, white fur, looked like a walking cloud. Every day, his owner
would take him to the park. At the park, Fluffy would run around
with kids alongside him and play with the other dogs. His wagging
tail was a display of his excitement.


One sunny day at the park, as Fluffy was dashing around, he
noticed a trickle of water dripping off a bench, forming a puddle
underneath. Fearless and fond of water, Fluffy approached and peered
under the bench, discovering something wonderful—a shiny red ball
nestled in the water.


Fluffy leaped into the puddle with an excited woof, causing water to
splash everywhere, leaving him soaked. Snatching the ball in his mouth,
Fluffy couldn’t contain his joy as he darted around the park, shaking
his wet fur and proudly displaying the ball to every dog he encountered.
Soon, a chorus of woofs echoed through the park as Fluffy led the other
dogs on a merry chase after the red ball, their tails wagging with delight.


Thanks to Fluffy’s discovery, the park was filled with the sounds
of happiness and the sight of wagging tails. Fluffy played with the red
ball until it turned dark outside.

As the day ended, Fluffy looked around at his friends, smiling
and grateful. It was a day full of excitement, wonderful discoveries,
and the joy of sharing. He had so much fun. It was finally time to go
home. With a heart full of happiness, Fluffy curled up in his cozy bed,
tired from his fun day in the park. He couldn’t wait to do it again
tomorrow.
