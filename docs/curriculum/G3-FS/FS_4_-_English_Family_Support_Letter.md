# **Welcome!**
## **Grade 3, Unit 4** **Foundational Skills**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will practice reading and spelling words with common vowel teams, prefixes and suffixes, and

homophones.


**What will my student learn?**


Students will learn how to read and spell words with more than one syllable that have the vowel teams _ee_ / _ea_, _ai_ / _ay_, and

_ue_ . They will apply what they know about long vowel sounds to new words. Students will then work with the prefixes

_un–_, _dis–_, _mis–_, _re–_, and _pre–_, as well as the suffixes _–ist_, _–ian_, and _–al_ . Students will identify, use, and explain the

meaning of homophones such as _ate_ and _eight_, and they will practice spelling those homophones as well. Students will

also practice reading with the Reader, _Frankie Figures It Out._ This story is about a young girl named Frankie who learns

the importance of rules. She initially finds rules confusing, but, through experiencing various situations, Frankie learns

that rules are needed for a safe and harmonious society.

Students can practice these words each night by doing the following activities:


1. **Sentence Creation:** Have your student use Tricky or High-Frequency Words in sentences. Encourage them to

create sentences that demonstrate the meaning of each word and explain its context.

2. **Word Association:** Ask your student to think of other words related to the Tricky and High-Frequency Words.

This will help reinforce their understanding of each word’s meaning and usage.

Students can practice these words each night by doing the following activities:


1. **Drawing and Writing:** Invite your student to write a sentence using the focus spelling patterns and then to

draw a picture to match their sentence.

2. **Word Challenges:** Challenge your student to find words with the focus spelling patterns in books, in

magazines, or around the house. When they identify a word, discuss its spelling and meaning.
