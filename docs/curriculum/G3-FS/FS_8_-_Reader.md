**Chapter**
### **A New Home**
# **1**

Tisha came into the house and marched by
Dad and Darrius without speaking. She went
right up the stairs to her bedroom. Tisha felt
sad and nervous. She did not like living in
Australia. It had been another long week since
she moved from Houston, Texas, to Brisbane,
Australia.


Tisha’s mom got a **promotion** that
demanded she work from the company’s
**headquarters** in Brisbane, so the family
packed up and moved to **Australia** during the
fall break from school. Tisha did not want to
move. She missed her friends, her school, and
her soccer team.

While Darrius tried to make his broccoli stand
up in his mashed potatoes during dinner, Tisha
just stared at her plate and pushed food around.
She was gloomy.


Dad asked, “How was your day?”


Tisha responded, “The school is so different
from my old one, and I’m still trying to make
friends.” Tisha’s family moved to Brisbane after
the school year began, and most of the kids
already knew each other and were friends.


“Plus,” Tisha added, “they do things so
differently here.”


“It takes time to adapt to a new place,” Dad
said. “Moving here was a special opportunity for
our whole family. This is a great place to live.
You’ll see. You just have to give it time.”


Unconvinced, Tisha groaned, poked a hole
in her napkin with her thumb, and weakly went
back to pushing food around on her plate.

“Let’s pump the brakes on talk of school,”
Mom said. “I have an idea. Why don’t you and
Dad go exploring this weekend? There are some
cool places to see.”


Before four-year-old Darrius could object to
not being invited, Mom made him an offer. “You
and I will hang out at the park and get ice cream,”
Mom said to Darrius. Mom wanted Tisha to have
one-on-one time with Dad. Back in Houston,
Dad coached Tisha’s soccer team. After games, the
team always went out for pizza. Mom knew that
spending time with Dad on the weekend the way
they did back home might lift Tisha’s mood.


“So,” Dad said to Tisha after dinner, “let’s learn
about Australia.”

**Chapter**
### **All About Australia**
# **2**

Dad and Tisha plopped down on the
couch with their tablets to learn more about
their new home. Dad suggested they first
learn about Australia’s landscape. “Once we
get the lay of the land,” Dad said, “we’ll plan
our first trip.”


After some research, Dad exclaimed,
“Here’s an interesting fact! Did you know
Australia is the only country that takes up a
whole continent?”


Tisha replied, “Yep, we learned about the
continents in first grade.”


“Okay, well, how about this fact? Much of
the middle of Australia is dry and sandy. This

area is commonly called the Outback. And




called the Great Dividing Range, where many




Dad added, “There’s so much more to
see. We should visit the Opera House; it’s the
most famous place for music and theater in
Australia. They have dance shows, singers, and
plays.”


Tisha’s eyes sparkled as she pointed to an
image. “And don’t forget the Sydney Harbor
Bridge,” she chimed in. “It’s called the Coat
Hanger because it looks like a huge clothes
hanger. By climbing to the top, we can see the
whole city and take in its sights and the scent
of the ocean.”


Dad nodded. “Australia is also known for
its beautiful **opals**, colorful **gems** dug from the
earth. They’re sent all around the world.” Tisha
started to feel enthusiastic about her new home
for the first time.



10


The family woke up early the following
Saturday and drove to the Brisbane **Festival**,
an international arts festival. “This will be a
day to remember,” Mom said as they arrived.


The best part of the festival was the **kazoo**
orchestra. The family each got a kazoo and
joined a big group of people making music
together. They laughed and played, the sounds




On Sunday, the family decided to watch a
**cricket** game. Dad explained, “Cricket is a big
deal here. It’s a game with a flat bat and a hard
ball, played by two teams of eleven players.
If the batting team hits the ball, the batter
runs back and forth between two stumps until
they’re out. It’s like baseball mixed with tag!”


The family cheered and clapped as they
watched the game, getting swept up in the

**Chapter**
### **Exploring the Great** **Barrier Reef**
# **3**

Dad and Tisha took off to see more sites
the following weekend. They were aiming for
a full day of activities. Dad and Tisha began
with the Great Barrier Reef. At daybreak, they
loaded the car with backpacks containing
snacks and bottled water for the drive north
to the city of Cairns. Snacks are always
a **mainstay** for long car rides! They said
goodbye to Mom and Darrius and hit the
road. Dad used the car’s GPS to follow the
pathway to the reef. Tisha didn’t admit it to
Dad, but she was excited to try snorkeling.



14


15


Dad and Tisha began with a tour cruise on a
glass-bottom boat. They could see magnificent
sea animals from the boat, like parrotfish and
giant clams. Tisha snapped photos to show
Mom and Darrius.


Their tour guide shared interesting facts
about the reef while Dad and Tisha watched all
the sea life.


“A coral reef is made mostly of coral
skeletons. Corals are small sea animals that live
in oceans. Some corals, called **polyps**, grow
together like a family,” the guide explained.
“When corals die, they leave behind their
skeletons. These skeletons build the **structure**
of the reef over many years.”



16


“The Great Barrier Reef helps **sustain**
the life of the many types of animals that
call it home,” the guide added. “Clownfish
are small, brightly colored fish. Despite their
name, clownfish are no more entertaining than
any other sea animal. An array of sharks also
inhabit the reef, including reef sharks, whitetip
sharks, and tiger sharks. The wobbegong is a
smaller shark that spends much of its time in
shallow waters to about 100 meters deep.”




18


Tisha pointed at the manta rays nearby.
“Those are my favorite,” Tisha said as she
watched them glide through the water with
their large, wing-like fins on full **display** . She
enjoyed their graceful underwater movements.


“Many of the reef’s sea residents rely on
one another for food and to maintain their
safety,” the guide said as they watched a small
fish move into the coral. “Smaller fish may
hide in corals to avoid being eaten by large
predators.”


“The reef has so many interesting sea
animals to admire, but **refrain** from getting
close to them when you are in the water!” the
tour guide said.



19


Dad and Tisha could also see many
underwater plants as they looked through the
boat’s glass. The tour guide pointed out and
discussed the many plants they observed.


“ **Algae** is one of the most common
plants in the Great Barrier Reef,” the guide
explained. “It can be green, brown, or red. It
has an essential job to do in the reef. Many
sea animals obtain their food and **oxygen** by
consuming algae.


“Mangroves aren’t part of the Great Barrier
Reef. They are trees found in coastal areas
near the reef. Their root system helps improve
water quality. Birds like the little bronze
cuckoo dwell in these trees.”


Tisha took out her sketch pad and doodled
some cool things she saw.



20


21


22


“Can we try **snorkeling** now?” Tisha
looked up and asked.


“Let’s do it!” Dad said.


Dad and Tisha made their way to a tour
operator offering snorkeling trips for people
of all ages. Dad rented the equipment and
reminded Tisha to listen carefully to the
guide’s instructions as they put on their
wetsuits.


Tisha kept an eye out for dolphins and sea
turtles. She learned during the boat tour that
whale-watching tours were popular during the
migration season. She’d love to see the whales
migrating to other areas and hoped they could
return when the time came.



23


Dad and Tisha explored some of the
islands after snorkeling. Dad scooped up
their backpacks, Tisha put on a hoodie, and
they headed to their next stop, Lizard Island.
“Darrius would love to visit an island named
for lizards,” Tisha said.


Dad agreed. “Next time we visit the island,
we’ll bring Mom and Darrius. Mom would
love the nature trails and seeing the island on
a moonlit evening,” Dad said.


Tisha took more photos, zooming in with
her camera to get close-ups. Tisha snapped
pictures of birds smoothly swooping to catch
fish. She couldn’t wait to share them with Mom
and Darrius.

**Chapter**
### **Australia’s First** **People**
# **4**

Tisha and Dad went to a local cultural
center for their next trip. Tisha was super
excited to learn about the art of Australia. She
had a neat idea: to make an art project using
pictures from her tour.


Tisha couldn’t wait. She started looking up
information about Australia’s First Nations
people while she rode in the car and shared
fun facts with Dad.


“Did you know,” Tisha read, “Australia’s
First Nations people have lived here for a long
time? They live on the mainland and some
islands close by.”



26


27


28


She discovered there are many different
groups of First Nations people, each group
with remarkable art, traditions, and ways of
talking. Tisha would love to recruit a native
person to speak at her school.


Tisha also learned something
extraordinary: The First Nations people have
a special bond with animals and nature. They
see themselves as nature’s friends, here to take
care of the land. Tisha imagined being a true
friend to all the trees and animals!


The First Nations culture is full of
storytelling, art, music, and dancing. They
use art and symbols, like secret codes, to share
stories about their past. They love telling
stories out loud, passing them from older
people to younger ones, and keeping their
traditions alive.



29


Tisha and her dad got to make a dot
painting during the tour. Dot painting is a
special kind of art where each dot and their
pattern tell a story about animals, land, or
people.


Tisha decided to paint the colorful fish
and corals she saw while snorkeling in the
beautiful blue water. She dotted her canvas
while the tour guide explained how people
used to paint with rocks, sticks, and leaves.
Now, those **fluent** in the art form use paint
and canvas, often choosing Australia’s earthy
colors like brown, red, and yellow.


“Did you know some of the oldest art in
the world is from Australia?” Tisha asked her
dad, smiling as she added another dot to her
underwater scene.

**Chapter**
### **Australia’s** **Animals**
# **5**

“Dad, look! Koalas!” Tisha excitedly
squealed as they entered Lone Pine Koala
Sanctuary in Fig Tree Pocket. Tisha loved
koalas‒they were her favorite!


It was Dad’s turn to do some research this
time. Dad grabbed a colorful pamphlet about
koalas as they strolled through the sanctuary
to pursue new activities and started to read.


“Guess what, Tisha? Koalas aren’t bears at
all! They’re a special kind of **mammal** called
a marsupial. Marsupials are cool because they
carry their babies in a pouch.”


Tisha looked amazed. “Like a kangaroo?”
she asked.



32


33


34


“Exactly!” Dad said, smiling. “Koalas live
in forests in Australia and are good at sitting
still in trees. It’s like they’re playing the world’s
longest game of freeze tag!”


“Do you think you could sit still as long as
a koala, Tisha?” Dad asked, chuckling.


Tisha giggled and shook her head. “No
way!”


Koalas, they continued to read, have super
strong arms and sharp claws for cruising up
trees. “They’re like little superheroes of the
trees!” Dad said. They also discovered that
koalas don’t see well but have excellent hearing
so they know when danger is near.



35


“Did you know, Tisha, koalas eat more
than a pound of leaves daily? That’s a lot of
chewing! That’s like eating a salad every single
meal!”


Tisha made a face. “That’s a lot of salad!”


Next, they visited the kangaroos and
wallabies. Tisha and Dad got to feed them!
“They’re so bouncy!” Tisha laughed as a
kangaroo hopped away with its snack.


The last stop was the **Platypus** House.
“I’ve never seen a platypus before,” Tisha said,
her eyes wide with curiosity.


“That makes two of us,” Dad replied,
equally excited.



36


They went home after a day full of animals
and adventures. At dinner, Tisha couldn’t
stop talking about the koalas, kangaroos,
and mysterious platypus. The **sanctuary** visit
gave her a renewed interest in learning about

**Chapter**
### **Deep in the Caves**
# **6**

Mom had exciting news one evening.
“Guess what? We’re going on a trip!” she
announced. Mom had to work in Perth, a big
city on the other side of Australia, and the
whole family was going!


Dad, Tisha, and Darrius explored Perth
while Mom was busy with her meetings. It
was a fun city with lots of things to see and
do. They couldn’t wait for Mom to finish
work so they could all explore together. Mom
hoped to find a museum about World War
II (WWII), something she remembered from
Grandpa’s stories.


Grandpa was in the Navy and used to
tell her about big battles. His ship, the USS
Houston, worked with the HMAS Perth
during one battle. During this battle, the


39


USS Houston and the HMAS Perth attacked
enemy ships to stall their advance toward
Australia. The effort between the ships began




Dad had a great idea! They could visit
Yanchep National Park (YNP) and a fantastic
museum called the WA **Maritime** Museum. The
museum houses many exhibits about sea history
and provides information about battles and


Mom got ready for work, and Dad and the
kids started planning. They decided their first
stop would be Yanchep National Park. Darrius
was eager to visit the Aquarium of Western
Australia (AQWA), and Tisha wanted to try
water sports at Swan River. They saved these for
when Mom could join.



41


Yanchep National Park was incredible!
They walked a long, protracted trail for about
one mi. through the park. It led them to
Crystal Cave. It was cool and a bit dark inside,
but they saw shiny rocks on the walls and
ceiling. Tisha thought the cave looked like a
fairyland. Darrius was amazed by the shapes of
the rocks.


They learned there are more than 400 caves
in the park. Dad and the kids **progressed**
through the park, visiting one cave after
another. Tisha wanted to see more, but Dad
told her, “Some of them are inactive and don’t
have tours.” Then they proceeded from the
caves to the chocolate shop and tearoom for a




Dad took Tisha and Darrius to the WA
Maritime Museum next. Tisha was amazed by
a giant submarine, and Darrius asked Dad lots
of questions about how it worked. Dad tried
to answer every question, and they all learned
something new.


They also had fun looking at old shipwrecks.
Tisha and Darrius talked about pirates and
treasure. They examined fascinating artifacts
from the sea. Dad liked watching them imagine
stories about the ships.




They saw models of enormous cargo
ships. Many sail as far as Antarctica. Dad
explained how these ships carry things all over
the world. Tisha and Darrius looked closely at
each model, pointing at the different parts.



44


They stopped at the gift shop before
going home. Tisha chose a book about sea
animals. Darrius picked a model submarine.


They talked a lot about their day in the
car ride home. Darrius said he wanted to be a
sailor. Tisha was excited about the sea.



45


**Chapter**
### **Finally, A Friend**
# **7**

Tisha felt more comfortable with her
new home now, but what’s a home without
friends? She still didn’t feel completely
comfortable at school.


Tisha burst into the house, one day, full of
excitement. “Dad! I made a new friend!” she
exclaimed. Her classmate, Sarah, had noticed
the cool **trinket** from Yanchep National Park
on Tisha’s desk and asked about it. Tisha told
her all about the adventure in the caves.



46


“Guess what? Sarah loves to play soccer,
or football as she calls it!” Tisha shouted.



47


48


A special guest named Rebecca from Football
Australia came to talk to the students at school.
She told them all about soccer in Australia. Tisha
learned that Brisbane’s first **prominent** women’s
soccer game was in 1921. Back then, not many
people thought girls could play soccer, so it took
a while to become popular.


“Things are different now,” Tisha reported.
“Women’s soccer is super popular! Rebecca even
talked about the Australian national team, the
Matildas, who played in the Olympic semi-finals
in 2021.”


Rebecca explained that the increased interest
in women’s football has **propelled** the sport
forward. She proceeded to explain that any kid
can join a soccer club in their community or play
at school. Her organization, Football Australia,
helps promote the sport by providing schools
with equipment and coaches for soccer programs.



49


after-school soccer program. Several kids
seemed to have a propensity for the sport. The
best part is that she got to play with her new
friend Sarah! They had so much fun kicking
the ball and learning new soccer tricks.


Driving home from Tisha’s football game
one day, the family dreamed about all the
fantastic spots they could visit in Australia.



50


“Let’s go to Sydney and Melbourne next,”
Dad suggested. Tisha was excited to visit the
Powerhouse Museum in Sydney. She couldn’t
wait to play with the interactive science
exhibits. Darrius was eager to check out
the Sydney Observatory. He loved stars and
planets, and the idea of using giant **telescopes**
to see them up close was awesome!




Mom had an excellent idea, too. She wanted
to visit Sydney Olympic Park and try her
hand at archery. “Maybe I’ll feel like a world
champion!” she laughed.




They planned to zoom over to Melbourne
from there. The family heard about the Star
Observation Wheel, where they could see the
whole city from high up in the sky. “It’ll be like
flying!” Darrius imagined.




There was also something extraordinary they
all wanted to see–the penguin parade at Phillip
Island. They heard visitors can watch little
penguins waddle up the beach at sunset. “That’s
going to be so cute!” Tisha giggled.




Tisha’s family needed to figure out where
to start with so many fun places to visit in
Australia. “There’s no need to rush,” Dad
assured them. “This is our home now. We’re
here to stay!”

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully leveled
in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.

The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
approximately forty sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and
many spellings can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed
to make early reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of
the available spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out
as part of their phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been
deliberately introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if
they are assigned at the proper time.

As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.


TRICKY WORDS:


algae, Australia, culture, marsupial. Melbourne, penguin, sanctuary, structure


**Code Knowledge added gradually in the unit for this Reader:**


  - Decode multisyllabic words with vowel teams.


  - Decode multisyllabic words with diphthongs.
