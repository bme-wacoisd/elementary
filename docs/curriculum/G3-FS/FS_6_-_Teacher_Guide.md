**Grade 3 | Foundational Skills 6**
#### Introduction


~~**UNIT 6 OVERVIEW**~~


This unit introduces several new skills that students will revisit or build upon in later units. It
begins with introducing contractions, moves to final stable syllables, and ends with spelling rules
for suffixes. Developing these foundational skills is essential to students’ proficient reading of
multisyllabic words and reading comprehension.


Students will first work on decoding and encoding contractions with _not, is, had, are,_ and _will_ . In
these lessons, students learn how contractions make our speech sound more friendly and improve
the tone of conversation within a text.


Students will then work with the final stable syllables _–ble, –dle, –gle, –sle, –zle, –ple, –cle, –kle,_ _–ckle_,
and _–cal_ . Students will learn how to decode, encode, and syllabicate words with these commonly used final
stable syllables. Syllable instruction in later units builds upon the foundation established in this unit.


Building upon the affix work from previous units, students will decode and encode words with _–ful_
and _–less_ suffixes while identifying how meanings change when these suffixes are applied to base
words. As the unit ends, students will continue working with suffixes as they revisit a previously
learned spelling rule (dropping the final ‘e’) and learn two new spelling rules that they will further
explore in later units (doubling final consonants and changing ‘y’ to ‘i’).


~~**TRICKY SPELLINGS**~~


As new spellings are introduced, some complexity is added to the reading process. Some of the
spelling units that students have to process are ambiguous in the sense that they can stand for
more than one sound. These ambiguous spellings are called “tricky spellings.” In Unit 6, instruction
focuses on final syllables, and students will learn how to decode, encode, and syllabicate words with
these commonly used final stable syllables.


~~**TRICKY WORDS & HIGH-FREQUENCY WORDS**~~


Tricky Words are introduced in this unit on an as-needed basis in the context of the different
selections included in the Reader. Tricky Words should be taught in the lessons before the reading
selections are assigned. When introducing Tricky Words, be sure to draw attention to the parts read
(and spelled) just as students would expect based on what they have learned so far and point out
the tricky parts of each word.


The Tricky Words taught in this unit are:


  - Lesson 2— _through_, _thought_


Introduction
**1**


**2**




 - Lesson 3— _spaghetti_


 - Lesson 5— _beautiful,_ _journeys_


 - Lesson 6— _diamond_


 - Lesson 7— _suggested_


 - Lesson 9— _knowledge_


In addition to addressing Tricky Words and tricky spellings, this program emphasizes the reading
and spelling of high-frequency words, carefully selected from word lists compiled by researchers
Edward William Dolch and Edward Fry. The selection of these words was based on their prevalence
within the unit Reader, and instruction is integrated into lessons at points where students will
naturally encounter these words within the assigned sections of the Readers. The curriculum
includes a structured approach for teaching high-frequency words, starting with the introduction of
8–12 keywords at the beginning of each unit, selected for their relevance and frequency in the unit’s
text. Words are introduced using phonetic sounding and Spelling Cards for decoding. Throughout
the unit, these words are reviewed in various contexts, including through decode/encode games and
fluency checkpoints to assess automaticity and fluency. This ensures that students engage with the
words multiple times, enhancing their reading skills and confidence.


The high-frequency words taught in this unit are:


 - Lesson 1 - _earth, life_


 - Lesson 2 - _high_


 - Lesson 3 - _done_


 - Lesson 6 - _mountains_


 - Lesson 7 - _together_


 - Lesson 9 - _often_


 - Lesson 12 - _under_


~~**READER: TO THE STARS: LILY EXPLORES SPACE**~~


Lily, a girl fascinated by the night sky and space, embarks on a journey to learn more about
astronomy. With her father’s support, she visits the library and discovers a wealth of knowledge
about stars, planets, the Milky Way galaxy, and the sun’s importance to life on Earth. Her excitement
about space grows as she learns about orbits, black holes, and other cosmic phenomena like
comets, asteroids, and meteors. Inspired by her newfound knowledge, Lily purchases a telescope,
indulging in stargazing with her dad and experiencing the wonders of the universe firsthand.


Foundational Skills 6


To share her passion with others, Lily starts a space club at school, where she and her friends
learn about famous astronomers and astronauts, including their groundbreaking discoveries
and missions. The club organizes a successful stargazing event, further igniting Lily’s dream of
becoming an astronomer. As she plans her future in space exploration, Lily’s love for astronomy
continues to flourish, symbolizing the endless mysteries of the universe waiting to be explored.


Each time students encounter a new section of text in the Reader, the lesson includes new
vocabulary words and/or phrases to accompany the section of text. There are lessons in which
students reread sections of the Reader, for the purpose of building fluency. These lessons do not
introduce new vocabulary or have a vocabulary chart.


~~**UNIT 6 ASSESSMENTS**~~


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


Throughout this unit, formative assessments are clearly marked for monitoring individual student
performance and progress in key skills. Quick Checks for Understanding to evaluate classroom
performance are also designated in each lesson. Fluency practice takes place regularly throughout
the unit.


**Student Performance Assessment**


In Lessons 14 and 15, you will be prompted to administer a multipart end-of-unit assessment. In the
first part, you will work one-on-one with students to complete the Fluency Assessment. Students
will engage in a review activity while awaiting their turn for the assessment. The Reading and
Spelling portion of the assessment takes place during the first twenty minutes of the second lesson.
Once students have completed the assessment, they will have time for Self-Sustained Reading.
Use time in this lesson to finish working with students who still need to complete the Fluency
Assessment in the previous lesson.


The target words in each of these assessments include the vowel sound/spellings taught in this
unit; distractors have been intentionally selected because they represent frequent sound/spelling
confusions. Student performance on these assessments is a good indicator of whether students
have mastered the new sound/spellings.


~~**REPEATED ROUTINES**~~


This unit strategically utilizes activities, games, and protocols from previous units to allow students
to practice new skills using familiar routines. Review and prepare for the following activities
introduced in previous units:


  - Reading and Dictation


  - Word Sort


Introduction
**3**


**4**




 - Pattern Search


 - Partner Reading


 - Choral Reading


~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice Unit 2 skills can be found in the Pausing
Point section included after the last lesson. It is strongly recommended that you pause for two days and
provide targeted review for individuals or groups of students in any areas in which they had significant
gaps on the end-of-unit assessment.


All students will benefit from an additional opportunity to reread pages from the decodable student
Readers. It is particularly important to make use of targeted activities if the end-of unit assessment and/
or formative assessments indicate that any students are experiencing difficulties with specific skills
taught during the unit. In the Pausing Point, activity pages are provided. You may wish to reproduce the
handwriting pages and use them for morning or seat work.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available in the program’s online materials. This
component has been designed to complement the unit. It consists of poetry, folklore, and fables.


These additional text selections provide opportunities for students to practice reading with fluency and
prosody (expression). See the Unit 1 introduction or directions in the Fluency Supplement for further
guidance.

~~**INTRODUCE CONTRACTIONS WITH NOT AND IS (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students to turn to their partner and discuss what they know about
contractions and how they change words.


  - Write the following sentences on the board: _They are going to the movies_ . and
_They’re going to the movies_ .


  - Ask: What do you notice about the two sentences? _(Answers may vary but_
_should reflect that one sentence has a contraction.)_


  - As students examine the sentences, explain that contractions are a way to
make writing seem more conversational and informal. As the sentences are
read aloud, direct students to notice the change.


  - Remind students when something contracts, it gets smaller. Similarly, they
can contract (make smaller) two words by combining them and leaving out a
letter. Explain that a _contraction_ is a new word made up of two words in which
some letters are replaced by an apostrophe.


  - Display Form Contractions (Digital Component 1.1) to show examples of

 - Focus on the first column: _is_ . Review the three examples: _she’s_, _it’s_, _that’s._


 - Prompt students to turn and talk: What letter does the apostrophe replace in
each example when the two words are condensed into a contraction? _(‘i’)_


 - Clarify that _she’s, it’s_, and _that’s_ can also stand for the words “she has,” “it
has,” and “that has.” Students will need to look at the context around the
word to decide which set of words makes up the contraction.


 - Display and read aloud the sentence: _She’s excited for her birthday party_ .


 - Ask: Does _she’s_ stand for _she is_ or _she has_ in this sentence? _(she is)_


 - Focus on the second column: _not._ Review the three examples: _can’t_, _aren’t_,
_wasn’t_ .


 - Prompt students to turn and talk: What letters does the apostrophe replace
in each example when the two words are condensed into a contraction? _(‘no’_
_and ‘o’)_


 - Think-Pair-Share: Pick one of the contractions in this column and use it in a
sentence. Say your sentence aloud to a partner.


 - Think-Pair-Share: Why might we sometimes choose to speak and write with
contractions? _(It’s faster to say or write. It sounds less formal.)_


~~**PRACTICE WITH READING AND DICTATION (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 1.1 while you display the digital version
(Digital Component 1.2).


 - Ask students to follow the directions and point to the first word: _cannot._

 - Then ask students to write a short letter to a friend using the contractions
from the boxes.


 - Remind students the difference between _it’s_ as a contraction and _its_ as a
possessive.


   - It’s a sunny day.


   - The dog lost its collar.


 - Release students to independently complete the rest of the table and the
writing activity.

Challenge


Have students orally
compose sentences
using glossary words
from Chapter 1 as well as
contractions: _astronauts,_
_galaxy, constellation,_
_photosynthesis,_
_gazing, enormous,_ and
_shimmering._




- Point to the root _astro_ in the word astronaut. Explain to students that the root
_astro_ means stars.


- Explain that _Lily Explores Space_ contains many high-frequency words. They
will come across these common words often as they read, in both the Reader
and in many different texts. Learning to recognize these words and how to
spell them will improve their overall reading and writing fluency.


- Display this lesson’s high-frequency words: _earth_ and _life_ .


- Ask: Based on what you already know about the Reader, why do you think
we might come across the words _earth_ and _life_ often as we read about Lily
exploring space? _(Earth is the name of the planet we live on, and the only_
_known planet to sustain life.)_


- Focus on the word _earth_ . Underline the common trigraph _ear_ . Remind
students that in Unit 4 they learned the high-frequency word _hear_, which has
this trigraph pronounced as /ee/, and review that when _hear_ becomes the
past-tense verb _heard,_ the trigraph _ear_ makes the /er/ sound.


- Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves: /er/ /th/. For additional support,
display the Spelling Cards for each sound.


- Point out that _earth_ can be written two ways: capitalized and uncapitalized.
When the ‘e’ is capitalized, _Earth_ is referring to our planet; it is a proper noun,
or the name of a specific place. When the ‘e’ is uncapitalized, _earth_ refers to
the ground or the surface of the land. In _Lily Explores Spac_ e, students will see
Earth as a proper noun.


- Focus on the word _life_ . Ask students to identify the VCe syllable pattern.
Remind them that even though the ‘i’ and the ‘e’ in _life_ are separated, they


Foundational Skills 6



**14**


work together to stand for the /ie/ sound. Point out the VCe syllable pattern
by drawing a horseshoe around the ‘i’ and ‘e’ and pointing to the consonant ‘f’
as the consonant within this pattern.


 - Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves: /l/ /ie/ /f/. For additional support,
display the Spelling Cards for each sound.


 - Focus students on the first paragraph of Chapter 1, starting with “Lily loved
gazing. . .” and ending with “. . . was in space.”


 - Explain that readers can warm up for reading just as athletes warm up before
playing a sport. Display the following sentences adapted from the Reader:


   - She gazed at the sky and saw the moon and a few shimmering stars.


   - Lily found books about the planets, stars, and universe.


   - Lily’s excitement grew as she started reading.


   - She read about the solar system and the planets that orbit the sun.


 - Explain that these sentences should be relatively easy for students to read;
they are good warm-ups for reading longer, more complex sentences.


 - Direct students to hold their hand in front of their mouth, cupping it to direct
the sound back to themselves. Instruct them to read each sentence aloud
three times to themselves, speeding up each time.


 - Ask: What contraction is used in this paragraph? _(couldn’t)_


 - Ask students to read Chapter 1, “Voyage to the Library” with a partner.


 - Move students into small groups. Direct them to take turns reading each
paragraph in the rest of the chapter aloud to their group, starting with “Lily
was sitting. . .” on page 1 and ending with “. . . in the sky!” on page 9.


 - Remind them to look for contractions as they read.


 - Review the definition together and ask students to share their understanding
of the word. Call on a few students to share their thinking.


 - Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension, as well as to check for
students’ ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or
multiple-meaning words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant
questions to clarify any information from the Reader or prompts. Example
prompts include:


1. **Literal.** What have you previously learned about NASA? _(Answers may vary_
_but should reflect that NASA is in Houston, Texas, and this is where astronauts_
_work to research space.)_

different contractions.


  - Focus on the third column: _are_ . Review the three examples: _you’re, they’re, we’re_ .


  - Prompt students to turn and talk: What letter does the apostrophe replace in
each example when the two words are condensed into a contraction? _(‘a’)_


  - Tell students that _you’re_ is sometimes confused with the possessive pronoun
_your._ Students will need to look at the context around the word to decide which
word is correct.


  - Display and read aloud the sentence: _I bought a bracelet that said,_ “ _You’re my_
_best friend.”_


  - Have students chorally read the sentence, replacing _you’re_ with the words _you are_ .


  - Display and read aloud the sentence: _I asked to use your eraser because I lost_
_mine._


  - Ask: What is being owned in this sentence? ( _eraser_ )


  - Focus on the fourth column: _will._ Review the three examples: _we’ll, I’ll_ and _you’ll_ .


  - Prompt students to turn and talk: What letters does the apostrophe replace

 - Clarify that _she’d, they’d,_ and _you’d_ can also stand for the words _she would_,
_they would_, and _you would_ . Students will need to look at the context around
the word to decide which set of words makes up the contraction.


 - Think-Pair-Share: Pick one of the contractions in this column and write a question
for your partner. Share your sentence aloud to your turn and talk partner.


~~**PRACTICE WITH READING AND DICTATION (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 2.1.


 - Read the directions to the students while students follow along: Choose
a word from the left column and a word from the right column. Combine
the words to form a contraction. Write the words you chose and the new
contraction in the middle column.


 - Model an example: _we_ + _had_ = _we’d_


 - Release students to independently complete the rest of the table.


 - Have students whisper read the two sentences below the table into their
hand and circle the contractions.


 - Direct students to the first set of blank lines. Explain that they will listen
as you say a contraction and the full form of the contraction with the two
individual words.


 - Clarify that students need only write down the contraction. Hearing the
individual words is just to help them think about how to condense two words
down to one.


 - Dictate the following contractions:


   - _we’ll—we will_


   - _I’d—I had_


   - _he’d—he had_


 - Direct students to the second set of blank lines. Explain that they will listen

- Prompt students to turn and talk: Does _it’s_ stand for _it is_ or _it has_ in this
passage? _(it is)_


- Focus on _sun’s_ on page 11.


- Ask: Is this a contraction or a possessive noun? _(possessive noun)_


Foundational Skills 6


 - Point out that _sun is_ or _sun has_ would not make sense in this context. Instead,
the sun owns or possesses the gravity in this sentence.


 - Point out the importance of accuracy when reading. Small errors can make
big changes in the meaning of a word or sentence. Accuracy in reading aloud
ensures that the text is understood as intended by the author.


 - Encourage students to self-correct as they read by pausing to reread any
words that they mispronounce. Direct them to pause regularly to go back
and question the meaning of specific words, as they did with _they’re_, _it’s_,
and _sun’s_ .


 - Pair students with intentional reading partners.


 - Instruct students to partner read the rest of Chapter 2, pages 12–15.


 - Direct them to look for other contractions in this chapter as they read
_(they’re, it’s, you’re, I’ll, you’ll, I’d)._


 - Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension, as well as to check
for their ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or
multiple-meaning words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant
questions to clarify any information from the Reader or prompts. Example
prompts include:


1. **Literal** . Based on what we have read today, what important information
did you learn about the solar system? _(Answers may vary but should reflect_
_understanding of the text.)_


2. **Inferential** . What is the most likely reason the author uses imagery in
paragraph 2, page 10, to describe the solar system? _(The author uses imagery_
_in paragraph 2 to help the reader visualize the sun being a light in the center of_
_the dance floor while the planets “dance,” or move, around the sun.)_


3. **Evaluative** . What key details from the text support the idea that gravity
plays an important role in the solar system? _(Gravity keeps the moon moving_
_around the earth. It’s like the string that keeps a kite from flying away. The_
_moon’s gravity also pulls on the Earth, causing the water to shift and create_
_low and high tides.)_


 - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses
using the following sentence stems:


   - Some facts I learned about the solar system are______ and another one
is ______.


   - The most likely reason is ...


   - Some key details are ...

syllables. ~~**[ TEKS 3.1.B; TEKS 3.2.A.ii; TEKS 3.2.B.i; TEKS 3.2.D ]**~~


~~**INTRODUCE FINAL STABLE SYLLABLES: –BLE, –DLE, –GLE (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that today they will learn another syllable type. Explain that the
syllable type ends in the sound / / + /l/ and is spelled with ‘le’.


 - Ask students to recall what every syllable must have. _(a vowel)_ Explain to
students that a final stable syllable provides the extra vowel necessary to
make it a two-syllable word. Think about the word _bumble_ . We hear the /b/,
/u/, /m/, /b/, /l/. We cannot spell the word as _bumbl_ because we need to
have at least two vowel sounds in a two syllable word.


 - Write the following word parts on the board: _han_, _stum_, _sing._


 - Write the following final stable syllables on the board: _–ble_, _–gle_, _–dle._


 - Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share and determine which final stable
syllable goes with each word part. _(handle, stumble, single)_


 - Circle the consonant + _le_ at the end of each word. Explain to students that
this combination of letters represents a new syllable pattern.


 - Display Final Stable Syllables: _–ble, –dle, –gle_ (Digital Component 3.1), and
pass out copies of TR 3.1 to students. Tell students that they are going to
explore three consonant _+le_ syllables: _–ble_, _–dle_, and _–gle_ .


 - Point out to students that when a syllable ends in ‘le’, they should look at how
many consonants come before the ‘le’.

Foundational Skills 6


 - Explain that if there are two consonants before ‘le’, then the word is chunked
into syllables by dividing between the consonants.


   - For example: _han/dle_


 - Select two students to tell you where to divide the words _stumble_ and _single._
_(stum/ble, sin/gle)_


 - Point out that in each of the previous words, the first syllable has the CVC
pattern. This syllable is closed, and the vowels in that syllable are short.


 - Using small whiteboards or notebook paper, call out each of the words and
ask students to spell the words correctly, applying the spelling pattern
learned. Monitor students’ work and provide feedback on applying the
spelling pattern correctly.


 - Say the following words as students spell them: _table, idle, bugle._


 - Ask: What do you notice about the number of consonants before ‘le’? _(There_
_is only one consonant before ‘le’.)_


 - Explain that in most instances when there is only one consonant before the
‘le’, the word is chunked into syllables by dividing before the consonant.


   - For example: _ta/ble_


 - Select two students to tell you where to divide the words _cradle_ and _bugle._
_(cra/dle, bu/gle)_


 - Point out that in each of the previous words, the first syllable has the CV
pattern. This syllable is open, and the vowels in that syllable are long.


 - Tell students that today they will focus on reading and writing words using
the _–ble, –dle_, and _–gle_ syllables.


~~**PRACTICE WITH READING AND DICTATION (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 3.1.

about mispronunciations, self-correction, pacing, transposition of words, and
expression.


  - Choose strategic prompts to check for comprehension. Have students
listen actively and ask relevant questions to clarify any information from the
Reader or prompts. Example prompts include:


1. **Literal** . What information does the author include about objects that get too
close to a black hole? _(Objects that get too close to a black hole stretch out_
_really long and thin, like spaghetti, because gravity pulls them so much that_
_light can’t escape.)_


2. **Inferential** . What does the conversation between Lily and her friends about
black holes show you about Lily? _(Lily was excited because she finds the_
_information interesting, and she doesn’t think that many people know about_
_black holes. This shows that she is curious and helpful.)_


3. **Evaluative** . What key details from the text support the idea that black
holes are difficult to see? _(Scientists struggle to observe black holes directly_
_because black holes do not give off any light, so scientists look at the effects_
_on nearby objects and measure their orbits instead.)_


  - Ensure students draw on evidence from the text to support their responses.
Provide sentence frames:


    - The author included the text/graphic ____, so that _____.


    - The conversation shows me that Lily ...


    - Based on paragraph ___, I can infer that . . .

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**



In this lesson, students learn about another final stable syllable _–cal_ . This
spelling is included with _–cle, –kle,_ and _–ckle_ because all of these spellings
are used for the sounds /k/ / l/. This lesson will include information to help

students differentiate between _el_ and _al_ spellings for this sound by informing
students that _-al_ is usually used when the letter before the suffix is a tall or
deep letter, such as _b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, p, t,_ or _y_ . If the letter before the suffix
is a small letter ( _a, c, e, m, n, o, r, s, u, v, w, x,_ or _z_ ), then the ending is usually
spelled _–el_ or _–al_ .



**Foundational Skills**

  - Gather at least nine index cards for each student.


  - Prepare word cards to provide to students with words that have final stable
syllables (circle, ankle, buckle, local).

~~**REVIEW FINAL STABLE SYLLABLES: –CLE, –KLE, –CKLE, –CAL (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that today they will continue to learn four more syllable types
that end in the sound / / + /l/ and are spelled with ‘le’. Then, they will review
all final stable syllable sounds learned.


  - Display Final Stable Syllables: _–cle, –kle, –ckle, –cal_ (Digital Component 5.1),
and pass out copies of TR 5.1 to students. Tell students that today they are
going to explore these four consonant + _le_ syllables: _–cle, –kle, –ckle, –cal_ .
Tell students that all of these spellings are used for the sounds /k/ / l/.


  - Write the following words on the board, and read them as you write: _circle_,
_ankle_, _buckle_, _local_ . Point to these words on Final Stable Syllables: _–cle_, _–kle_,
_–ckle_, _–cal_ .


  - Underline ‘le’ at the end of _circle, ankle,_ and _buckle_ . Point out that this pattern
or combination of letters represents a new syllable pattern.


  - The ‘e’ is used with a syllable ending in a consonant ‘le’ pattern, as in _circle_,
_ankle_, and _buckle_ .


  - Point out that, just as in spellings like _–gle_, _–ble_, and _–zle_, when a syllable
ends in ‘le’, they should look at how many consonants come before the ‘le’. If
there are two consonants, then the word is chunked into syllables by dividing
between the consonants.

Foundational Skills 6


- Point out that in words with the _–ckle_ spelling, the ‘ck’ will be split apart into
two separate syllables.




- Point to the final word, _local_ . Tell students that this word has a spelling that
does not follow the same pattern we have been studying. Instead of the
spelling _–le_, _local_ uses the spelling _–al_ . Emphasize that this spelling works
with the letter ‘c’ to stand for the same sound as the other words in this
lesson: /k  l/.




 - In this word, there is only one consonant before ‘le’. In most instances when there
is only one consonant before the ‘le’, we divide before the consonant: _lo/cal._


 - Point out that in this case, the first syllable has the CV pattern. This syllable is
open, and the vowel is long.


~~**PRACTICE WITH READING AND DICTATION (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 5.1.


 - Pass out index cards to each student. Ask students to follow instructions and
listen carefully as you read each word.


 - Ask students to write the word on an index card, divide the words into
syllables, and underline the final stable syllable.

_fantastic, potatoes, enchanted)._


  - Prepare sentence frames to provide to students:


    - The syllables in this word are ___.


    - This syllable is ___ because ___.


**Reading**

  - Preview the section of the Reader that will be read during this lesson.
Consider using sticky notes to mark this section to easily find vocabulary
terms: _asteroid_, _astonishing_, _atmosphere_, _enchanted_, _meteor_, and _meteorite_ .
Display vocabulary on the board for students to decode.


  - Utilize data to intentionally predetermine reading partners. Consider utilizing
the following documents to track and record student progress:


    - Grade 3 Fluency Record


    - Partner Reading Feedback (Unit 1, Lesson 9)


    - Anecdotal Reading Record


  - Prepare sentence stems to provide to students:


    - An asteroid/meteor is ___. They are interesting because ___.


    - In this section of the text, the author talks about ___.


    - One key detail in this part of the text is ___.


    - After reading this section, it is clear that ___.


**Universal Access**

  - To make syllable division concrete for students, map from the first vowel to
the next vowel by pointing to the letters and writing ‘V’s and ‘C’s under the
letters in the word. This will show the first pattern for syllable division. Then,
underneath and to the right, map from the second vowel to the third so you
can more clearly see the next syllable division pattern. This is called stacked
mapping.


  - Prepare visuals of an asteroid and a meteor for Emergent Bilingual Students.


  - Prepare Syllable Cut-Ups resource game for additional syllabication support.

**Primary Focus:** Students will read and spell multisyllabic words by dividing them
into syllables. ~~**[TEKS 3.1.B; TEKS 3.2.A.ii; TEKS 3.2.B.i; TEKS 3.2.D ]**~~


~~**REVIEW SYLLABLE DIVISION RULES (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students what they recall about syllable division rules and why it is
important that we learn how to divide words into syllables. Have students
turn and talk to activate their background knowledge. Provide sentence
stems: “Syllables are divided by . . .” or “When we divide words into syllables,
“we . . .” for students to use in their discussions.


  - Review syllable division rules by modeling syllabication of _established_ .


  - Display the word _fantastic_ .


  - Underline the vowels and label each with a ‘V’ for vowel. Write a ‘C’ under
each consonant.


  - Explain that when two consonants come between two vowels, divide between
the consonants. This means the first syllable is closed because it ends with a
consonant, so the vowel has a short /a/.


  - Explain that because there are two consonants after the first vowel ‘a’, you
will put a slash between the letters ‘n’ and ‘t’. This is a CVC syllable pattern
_fan_ .


  - Point to the next vowel: ‘a’. Because only one consonant comes between two
vowels, divide after the ‘a’. This makes the second syllable an open syllable,
and it will have the short should /a/. This is a vowel-consonant-vowel pattern.


  - Review that the final syllable is – _stic_ and is pronounced /stik/.


  - Blend the syllables together to decode the word _fantastic_ .


**TEKS 3.1.B** Follow, restate, and give oral instructions that involve a series of related sequences of action; **TEKS 3.2.A.ii**
Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe

Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by spelling multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe syllables;
vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables; **TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete
words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.


Foundational Skills 6


~~**PRACTICE WITH DICTATION AND SYLLABICATION (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 6.1 and follow instructions.


 - Direct students to the blank lines. Explain that they will listen as you say
each word once, then listen again and write the word in cursive: _telescope_,
_fantastic_, _established_, _enchanted_, _potatoes_ . If a student needs to hear the
word again, say “Class repeat.” This will encourage active listening and
participation.


 - Instruct students to write a sentence on the lines with the word the teacher
says aloud. Remind students to write a complete sentence with a capital
letter at the beginning and punctuation at the end.


 - Dictate: _Studying comets helps astronomers understand the solar system_ .


 - Direct students to complete the responses by neatly writing in cursive,
leaving space between words.


 - After dictating words, have students work in partners to read the words,
dividing them into syllables. Offer feedback such as “Focus on keeping your
letters of uniform size and proportion.” and “Focus on connecting your letters
smoothly. Work on making the transition from ‘u’ to ‘d’ more fluid.”


**Note:** The word _telescope_ contains schwa–an open unstressed syllable.
Provide immediate and corrective feedback if students have difficulty with
syllabicating this word. You may consider syllabicating this word on the
board for the entire class: tel/e/scope (closed syllable/open schwa/VCe
syllable).

the letters with a ‘C’ or ‘V.’ Ask: What pattern emerges? _(two CVVC patterns)_


Lesson 6 Review Dividing Three-Syllable Words
**65**


**66**




- Ask: Where should the syllables be divided? _(between the consonants)_ Draw
a line to divide the two syllables, _moun/tains_ . Say the syllables as you clap
them, then have students repeat in unison.


- Focus on the first syllable. Underline the vowel team ‘ou’. Remind students
that they have learned that these vowels together are sometimes
pronounced as a diphthong, or sliding vowel, that sounds like /ow/ as in
_mouse_ . They have seen this team with the high-frequency word _about._


- Focus on the second syllable. Underline the vowel team ‘ai’. Remind students
that they have learned that schwa is a common sound for a vowel to make in
an unstressed syllable. In _mountains_, the stress is on the first syllable.


- Say the syllables as you clap them, then have students repeat in unison.
Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves: /m/ /ow/ /n/ /t/ / / /n/ /z/. For
additional support, display the Spelling Cards for each sound.


- Display the Tricky Word, read it, and use it aloud in a sentence:


  - _diamond_


- Point out which parts of each word are not regular and either will be taught
later or simply must be remembered.


  - Tricky Word: _diamond_ (Explain that the ‘ia’ is pronounced as a long ‘i’.)


- Invite students to share what they already know about the meaning of this
word.


- Guide the class in reading Chapter 5, starting with “Lily was excited . . .” on
page 26.


- Begin reading the first sentence. Pause before you get to the word _asteroid_ and
point it out as a word you are unsure how to pronounce. Point out the fact that
it is a bolded word, which means the pronunciation is located in the glossary.


- Review referencing the glossary to support reading the word _asteroid_ .


- Reread the entire sentence fluently from the beginning.


- Remind students they should restart and reread an entire sentence to build
fluency and ensure comprehension. Pausing to decode unfamiliar words
can disrupt comprehension, so this strategy helps tie the sentence together
smoothly.


- Tell students this chapter is full of multisyllabic words they may be unfamiliar
with, and they should read carefully and accurately while still supporting their
comprehension through rereading.


- Pair students with intentional reading partners.


Foundational Skills 6


 - Instruct students to partner read the assigned section of the Reader,
ending with “. . .stars with you.” on page 29. When reading or discussing the
story, remind students to speak at an appropriate rate and volume while
maintaining eye contact.


 - As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record and provide immediate and
corrective feedback about students reading accurately and self-correcting
when reading the text.


 - Choose strategic pausing points to check for comprehension. Have students
listen actively and ask relevant questions to clarify any information from the
Reader or prompts. Example prompts include:


1. **Literal.** What is the difference between asteroids and meteors mentioned in
the text? _(Asteroids are like space rocks that orbit the sun, while meteors are_
_smaller pieces of asteroids that enter Earth’s atmosphere.)_


2. **Inferential.** What is the most likely reason the author compares the shapes
of asteroids to potatoes and diamonds? How does that help you visualize
what asteroids look like? _(To illustrate that they can come in different sizes_
_and forms, such as space potatoes or diamonds.)_


3. **Evaluative.** What do Lily’s words and actions show about her relationship
with her dad? _(Lily is close to her dad and enjoys spending time with him._
_Evidence: Her favorite time was when her dad joined her. They spent hours_
_together, stargazing and talking about the mysteries of the universe.)_


 - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses
using the following sentence stems:


   - Asteroids are _____ while meteors are _____.


   - The author wanted to ...


   - Lily is _____. I know this because in the text...

  - Review syllable division rules by modeling syllabication of _quadruple_ .


  - Remind students that they can use what they know about syllable types and
chunking to read and spell these words.


  - Write the word _quadruple_ on the board in cursive, modeling proper letter
formation. Invite students to write the words in cursive in the air with their
index finger.


  - Ask: What do you notice about the end of this word? ( _It has a –ple_ _syllable._ )


  - Prompt students to turn to an elbow partner and identify the three vowel
spellings. _(‘a,’ ‘u,’ and ‘ple’_ ) Focus students’ attention on _quadruple_ while you
underline the vowels and label each with a ‘V’ for vowel. Write a ‘C’ under
each consonant.


  - Ask: Why is the first ‘u’ is not considered a vowel spelling? ( _It is there as part_
_of the ‘qu’ consonant spelling._ )


  - Focus students’ attention on _quadruple_ and direct students to Think-PairShare: Where does the first syllable end? ( _after the ‘d’_ ) Invite a student to the
board to draw a slash between the letter ‘d’ and ‘r’.


  - Direct students to Turn and Talk: How did you know the first syllable ended
there? ( _When two consonants come between two vowels, the word divides_
_between the consonants._ )


  - Prompt students to turn to an elbow partner and explain the difference
between an open syllable and a closed syllable. ( _An open syllable has a long_
_vowel sound and ends in a vowel; a closed syllable has a short vowel sound_
_and ends in a consonant._ )


**TEKS 3.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and make pertinent comments; **TEKS 3.2.A.ii**

Foundational Skills 6


 - Ask: Is the first syllable open or closed? ( _It is closed because it has a short_
_vowel sound and ends with a consonant.)_


 - Point out that this is a CVC syllable pattern: _quad_ .


 - Ask students to turn to an elbow partner and identify the final syllable. ( _–ple_ )


 - Confirm that this word ends with a consonant + _le_ syllable. Point out that the
vowel in that syllable is ‘e’. Explain that since this is a consonant + _le_ syllable,
it is pronounced /p/ / l/, so the syllable is divided before the spelling ‘ple’.


 - Point out the ‘r’ and ‘u’ in the middle. Ask students to turn to an elbow partner
and determine if this is an open or closed syllable. ( _Explain that it is a CV_
_syllable pattern, pronounced with a long ‘u’ sound, so it is open._ )


 - Prompt students to chorally blend the syllables together to decode the word
_quadruple_ .


 - Explain that _quadruple_ means “multiplied by four.”


 - Tell students that in this lesson, they will focus on reading and writing threesyllable words using all of the consonant + _le_ spellings they have learned.


~~**PRACTICE WITH READING AND DICTATION (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 7.1.


 - Display the following for student reference during Reading and Dictation:
Final Stable Syllables: – _ble_, – _dle_, – _gle_ ; Final Stable Syllables: – _sle_, – _zle_, – _ple_ ;
and Final Stable Syllables: – _cle_, – _kle_, – _ckle_, – _cal_ .


 - Ask students to point to the first word: _flexible_ .


 - Ask students what stable syllable they see in the word. (– _ble_ ) Have students
underline the syllable.


 - Ask students how many syllables are in the word. ( _three_ ) Have students write
‘V’ under each vowel.


 - Point out that because there is an ‘x’ after the vowel, the vowel is short, and
the syllable divides after the ‘x’. This is because the /x/ sound is always
preceded by a short vowel sound.


 - Prompt students to turn to an elbow partner and determine where to mark
the next syllable. ( _before the letter ‘b’_ ) Point out that this leaves the ‘i’ by
itself. Because it is not stressed, this ‘i’ is pronounced as a schwa.


 - Prompt students to chorally blend the syllables together to decode the word
_flexible_ .

Beginning
Ask questions about
words with final stable
syllables: What final
syllables do you hear in
the word _critical_ ? What
final syllables do you hear
in the word _flexible_ ? What
final syllables do you hear
in the word _multiple_ ?
In pairs, have students
practice pronouncing
these words.


Intermediate
Have students find words
with final stable syllables
in a book, newspaper,
or magazine. Have them
write down the words they
find and discuss their
meanings with a partner.
Encourage students to
listen to their partner’s
words and compare them
to their list to see if they
found any different words.


Advanced/Advanced High

Have students write
sentences using any
words with final stable
syllables that they have
learned. In pairs, they
can read their sentences

- Have students point to the word _multiple_ . Prompt them to underline the
consonant +le syllable ( _–ple_ ) and label the vowel spellings and consonants.


- Ask students how many syllables are in this word. ( _three_ )


- Ask students where they should divide the syllables. ( _mul/ti/ple_ )


- Prompt students to chorally blend the syllables together to decode the word
_multiple_ .


- Focus students’ attention to the word _critical_ . Remind students that _–al_ is
usually used when the letter before the suffix is a tall or deep letter ( _b_, _d_, _f_, _g_,
_h_, _j_, _k_, _l_, _p_, _t_, and _y_ ). If the letter before the suffix is a small letter ( _a_, _c_, _e_, _m_, _n_,

_o_, _r_, _s_, _u_, _v_, _w_, _x_, or _z_ ), then the ending is usually spelled _–el_ or _–al_ .


- Ask: Is the letter before the suffix a tall or deep letter, or is it a small letter?
Confirm for students that the letter before the suffix is small ‘c’, so the
sounds / / + /l/ are spelled with _–al_ .


- Prompt students to chorally blend the syllables together to decode the word
_comical_ .


- Direct students to read the remaining words, underline consonant + _le_
syllables, and divide the syllables.


- Have students read the two sentences next to numbers six and seven,
underline consonant + _le_ syllables, and divide the syllables.


- Direct students to the blank lines. Explain that they will listen as you say
each word once, then listen again and write the word: _comical_, _unstable_,
_mishandle_, _tentacle_, _optical_ .


- After dictating words, have students work independently to read the words,
underlining the consonant + _le_ ending and dividing them into syllables.


- Have students write a sentence using one three-syllable word with consonant
+ _le_ syllables from Activity 7.1 on the line next to number 13.


- Direct students to complete the responses in cursive. Offer feedback such as
“Focus on maintaining consistent slant and angle throughout your writing.”
and “Check the spacing between your words. Make sure there’s enough room
between each word to maintain readability.”

their groups after they finish reading. Have students listen actively and ask
relevant questions to clarify any information from the Reader or prompts.
Example prompts include:


1. **Literal.** What did Lily bring to the Space Club to share? _(She brought her_
_telescope so she could explain to her friends how it does important work.)_


2. **Inferential.** What is the most likely reason the author includes the diagram
of the telescope on page 33? _(so the reader will be able to see what a_
_telescope looks like and identify the different parts of a telescope)_


3. **Evaluative.** What is the most likely reason the author uses the words “the
dance of planets and galaxies” to describe what is happening in space on
page 31? _(to make a comparison of the planets moving and a dance)_


 - Ensure students draw on evidence from the text to support their responses
given the following sentence stems:


   - Lily brought...

  - Have students practice adding final stable syllables to base words. Provide
them with a list of base words (examples include _bit_, _chuck_, _gig_, _lit_, _hum_,
etc.). Have students determine what final stable syllable would make each
base word into a real two-syllable word. Also discuss with students which
words already have two consonants at the end (e.g., _chuck_ ) and which only
have one consonant, and therefore require that final consonant to be doubled
before adding – _le_ (e.g., _gig_, _lit_ ).


  - Provide students with final stable syllable words that have the final ‘e’ and the
consonant before the ‘l’ removed (e.g., provide _am_l__ for _ample,_ or _tac_l__ for

**Lesson 9: Introduce Suffixes: –ful and –less**
#### Foundational Skills


**Primary Focus:** Students will read and spell words with suffixes.

~~**TEKS 3.1.B; TEKS 3.2.A.vi; TEKS 3.2.B.vii; TEKS 3.2.D**~~


~~**ADD SUFFIXES: –FUL AND –LESS (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students they will work with suffixes today. Ask for student volunteers
to share with the class what they remember about suffixes. Answer may
include: a suffix is a group of letters added to the end of a base word, and
these letters change the meaning of the word when they are added.


  - Prompt students to turn and talk: Who can remember what happens to a
noun base word when the _–y_ suffix is added after a noun base word? _(It turns_
_a noun into an adjective.)_


  - Explain that the two new suffixes they will learn today will also change the
meaning of a base word.


  - Tell students they will work with two suffixes today: _–ful_ and _–less_ . Explain
that _–ful_ means “full of” and _–less_ means “without.”


  - Display Word Matrix (TR 9.2) _–ful_ and _–less,_ explain the contents of each
column.


  - In the first column is the base word in the next column is the suffix _–ful_ or _–less._


  - Tell students they will create new multisyllabic words with _–ful_ suffix using
the matrix for support.


**TEKS 3.1.B** Follow, restate, and give oral instructions that involve a series of related sequences of action; **TEKS 3.2.A.vi** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words using knowledge of suffixes, including how they can change base words
such as dropping e, changing y to i, and doubling final consonants; **TEKS 3.2.B.vii** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge
by spelling words using knowledge of suffixes, including how they can change base words such as dropping e, changing y to i,
and doubling final consonants; **TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate
spaces between words.


Foundational Skills 6


 - Model first using the base word _pain_ .


 - Demonstrate adding the suffix _–ful_ . Write _painful_ on the board. Ask students
to Think-Pair-Share what _painful_ may mean.


 - Prompt students to turn and talk: What does _painless_ mean? ( _without pain_ )
How do you know? Prompt students to use the sentence frame: “I understand
that ‘painless’ means ___ because ___.” Prompt students to turn and talk: How
are these words similar? (They both contain the base word _pain_ .)


 - Prompt students to turn and talk: How are these words different? _(They have_
_different endings or suffixes_ . _)_


 - Underline the suffix in each word. Explain that because _–ful_ means “full of,”
_painful_ means “full of pain.”


 - Call on student volunteers to come up with base words to try in the matrix.


 - Create new words, decode words, and discuss the meanings.
**Note:** Base words to use if students need guidance: color, skill, cheer. Give
students a brief meaning for each base word as needed.


 - Display Add Suffixes: _–ful_ and _–less._


 - Tell students they will help you add suffixes to some more base words. Point
to the word _harm_, and ask students to read the word aloud. Point to the suffix
_–ful_ . Write the new word in the third column: _harmful_ .


 - Ask students to read the new word aloud as you run your finger underneath it.


 - Repeat with the rest of the words from the chart: _harmless, meaningful,_
_meaningless._


 - Prompt students to turn and talk: How does the meaning of each word
change when a different suffix is added? ( _“full of harm” versus “without_
_harm”; “full of meaning” versus “without meaning”_ )


~~**PRACTICE WITH READING AND DICTATION (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 9.1, and pass out copies of TR 9.1 to
students.


 - Ask students to point to the first word: _hopeful_ .


 - Prompt students to turn and talk: What is the base word? ( _hope_ )


 - Prompt students to turn and talk: What is the suffix? ( _–ful_ )


 - Ask students to underline the suffix.



Support


Provide sentences if
students need additional
support with the meaning
of newly formed words.
For example, if a student
is not sure about the
meaning of _forceful_, offer
a sentence that provides
some context such as
“His knocks on the door
were so _forceful_ that the
wreath hanging on the
door shook.”



Lesson 9 Introduce Suffixes: –ful and –less
**93**


Challenge


Have students make a
T-chart with – _less_ as a
heading on one side and
_–ful_ as a header on the
other. Ask them to come
up with new base words
that could add both – _ful_
and _–less_ to make a new
word (e.g., harmful/
harmless, meaningful/
meaningless, etc.).


Activity Page 9.1


**94**




 - Use sound-by-sound blending to decode _hopeful_ .


 - Ask students to read all five words, annotating the suffix.


 - Direct students to the blank lines. Explain that they will listen as you say each
word once, then listen again and write the word.


 - Circulate and monitor to check for correct letter formation in cursive.
Provide corrective feedback on students annotation of suffixes. Offer
feedback such as such as “Ensure that your letters are properly spaced and
don’t run into each other.” and “Great job forming the letter ‘u’! I like how you
started at the top and made a smooth, curved line.”


 - Read the following words: _frightful, sleepless, unlawful, powerless, respectful_ .


 - After dictating words, have students work in pairs to read the words,
annotating the suffix and explaining how the suffix changes the meaning of
the word. Provide the following sentence stem for students: “The suffix ___
changed the meaning of the word ___ because ____.”


 - Read the directions to the Challenge section: Think of one word that has the
suffix _–less_ and one word that has the suffix _–ful_ . Write the words on the lines
below.

Reading




- Conduct a brief discussion about the different words in the chart. Before
reading each definition, ask students to hold up a 0–3 fingers to show how
well they know the word. 0 = never heard the word; 1 = heard the word but
don’t know what it means, 2 = would know the word if they heard it used in a
sentence; 3 = understand the word and could teach someone what it means.


- Model how to use the glossary in the Reader to discover the pronunciation
and definition of words in bold. Review the definition together and ask
students to share their understanding of the word. Call on a few students to
share their thoughts.



Beginning
Have students retell what
they have read in _To the_
_Stars: Lily Explores Space_ .
Have students draw
pictures to represent what
has happened. Provide
sentence frames: “In the
story, the main character
is ___.” “The story takes
place in ___.”

~~**ELPS 4.I**~~


**96**




- Write the word _meaningful_ on the board. Explain that this word is in today’s
chapter. Remind students that they have learned about base words with the
suffix _–ful_ .


- Change the suffix to _–less_ .


- Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share: How does this change the meaning
of the word? _(_ Meaningful _means “full of meaning” and_ meaningless _means_
_“without meaning.”)_


- Explain that students will follow instructions and examine a new highfrequency word. Display the word _often._


- Point out that _often_ is usually pronounced with a silent ‘t’, though some
people choose to pronounce the ‘t’.


- Explain that in the word ending with _–ften_, – _sten_, and – _stle_, the ‘t’ is usually
not pronounced. This is because it is between two other consonant sounds,
and leaving out the ‘t’ sound makes pronunciation easiest.


- Display the following words with a silent ‘t’ and instruct students to read the
words chorally: _often_, _soften_, _castle_, _whistle_, _jostle_, _listen_, _glisten_, _moisten_,
_fasten._


Foundational Skills 6


 - Display Tricky Word, read the word, and use it aloud in a sentence:


   - _knowledge_


 - Point out which parts of each word are not regular and either will be taught
later or simply must be remembered.


   - Tricky Word: _knowledge_ (Explain that the ‘k’ is silent; know is pronounced
with a /o/ instead of a /oe/ sound.)


 - Invite students to share what they already know about the meaning of this
word.


 - Guide the class in reading Chapter 7 in _To the Stars,_ pages 36–41.


 - Pair students with intentional reading partners. Instruct students to partner
read the assigned section of the Reader.


 - Model partner reading with a student volunteer, alternating reading
sentences and providing assistance to each other as needed.


 - Direct reading partners to focus on reading with appropriate pace. Model as
needed. (Example: “Pay attention to punctuation marks such as commas,
periods, and semicolons. Pause briefly at commas and longer at periods to
create natural breaks in your reading.”)


 - As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record. Record notes about
mispronunciations, self-correction, pacing, transposition of words, and
expression.


 - Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension, as well as to check
for their ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or
multiple-meaning words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant
questions to clarify any information from the Reader or prompts. Example
prompts include:


1. **Literal.** What did Nicolaus Copernicus believe about the universe according
to the text? _(Nicolaus Copernicus believed that Earth goes around the sun,_
_contrary to the common belief at that time that the sun orbited Earth.)_


2. **Inferential.** Based on the text, “Astronomers watch for changes in the sky,
always hoping to make meaningful discoveries,” what type of discovery would
be meaningful? _(Discovery of a new planet, comet, asteroid, or a new object in_
_space.)_


3. **Evaluative.** Do you agree with the statement “Astronomers are ‘fearless’
in their search for knowledge?” Why or why not? _(Answers may vary but_
_should reflect an understanding that astronomers continuously seek to make_
_discoveries about the vast and wondrous universe.)_



Challenge


Have students compare
and contrast Galileo and
Copernicus using a Venn
diagram. Encourage them
to use words with – _ful_
and – _less_ to describe
the similarities and
differences.

 - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses
using the following sentence stems:


   - Nicolaus Copernicus believed ...


   - Discovery of _____, ______, or ______ would be meaningful.


   - I agree because ... I disagree because ...


~~**WRAP UP (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 9.2, and pass out copies of TR 9.2 to
students. TR 9.3 is also an optional T-Chart to help students as needed.


 - Read the first sentence: _They use powerful telescopes to see distant galaxies._


 - Draw attention to the underlined base word: _power._


 - Prompt students to turn and talk: What suffix has been added to power?
_(–ful)_


 - Explain that this word would mean “full of power” because of the added
suffix.


 - Prompt students to turn and talk: If we change the _–ful_ to _–less_, what would
be the new meaning of the word? _(without power)_


 - Read the new sentence with the new suffix added to the base word: _The_
_superhero was powerless to stop the empty cargo ship from sinking in the_
_massive storm._


 - Draw students’ attention to the instructions at the top of the page and invite
them to answer question 2. Circulate and monitor to check for correct letter
formation in cursive. Provide corrective feedback.


 - Point out questions 3 and 4. Explain to students that they will need to use
what they know about each suffix to determine the meaning of the word in
context. Tell students to use the process of elimination, if needed, to help
determine the correct answer.


 - When students have finished the first four questions, draw their attention
to the last item on the page. Read it aloud: “Use at least one word from the
word bank to write a sentence telling something you learned about Galileo or
Copernicus.”


 - Invite students to complete the last item. Offer feedback such as “Focus on
maintaining consistent slant and angle throughout your writing.” and “Focus
on connecting your letters smoothly. Work on making the transition from ‘l’ to
‘e’ more fluid.”

Check for Understanding


As students search for words with the suffix _–ful_ and/or _–less_, note students who

may need additional support to identify these words. Pause to confer with students,

asking them to identify the base word and suffix and read the word.


**End Lesson**


**Lesson 9: Differentiated Instruction**

    - Word list: _painful_ versus _painless;_ _powerful_ versus _powerless;_ _joyful_
versus _joyless_


  - Read and/or show the following sentences. Ask them to choose the suffix,
_–ful_ or _–less,_ that would make the most sense to complete the sentence.


    - She is so cheer___ that she seems to always have a smile on her face.
_(_     - _ful)_


    - The broken tool was use___ for helping them fix the old door. _(_    - _less)_

**Primary Focus:** Students will collaborate with others to spell words that change
the base word by doubling final consonants. ~~**[ TEKS 3.1.D ]**~~

Students will read and spell words with suffixes that change the base word by
doubling final consonants. ~~**[ TEKS 3.1.B; TEKS 3.2.A.vi; TEKS 3.2.B.vii; TEKS 3.2.D ]**~~


~~**INTRODUCE SUFFIXES: DOUBLE THE FINAL CONSONANT (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students to turn to their partner to recall what they have learned about
suffixes.


  - Tell students they will continue to work with suffixes today. Remind them that
a suffix is a group of letters added to the end of a base word; these letters
change the meaning of the word when they are added.


  - Explain that students will work with the suffix _–ing_ ; this suffix shows an
action is taking place.


  - Explain that one-syllable words with a short vowel sound and a single
consonant ending change to a double-letter spelling at the end when the
suffix (ending) _–ing_ is added. (Write this rule on the board for students to
reference on Activity Page 10.2.) If the letters are not doubled, then the vowel
sound in the base word would change from short to long.


  - Display Word Matrix (TR 10.1) _–ing_, _–ed_, _–er_ explain the contents of each
column.


  - In the first column is the base word in the next column is the suffix _–ing_, _–ed_,
or _–er._


  - Tell students they will create new multisyllabic words with these suffixes
using the matrix for support.


**TEKS 3.1.D** Work collaboratively with others by following agreed-upon rules, norms, and protocols; **TEKS 3.1.B** Follow,
restate, and give oral instructions that involve a series of related sequences of action; **TEKS 3.2.A.vi** Demonstrate and apply
phonetic knowledge by decoding words using knowledge of suffixes, including how they can change base words such as
dropping e, changing y to i, and doubling final consonants; **TEKS 3.2.B.vii** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by
spelling words using knowledge of suffixes, including how they can change base words such as dropping e, changing y to i, and
doubling final consonants; **TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate
spaces between words.


Foundational Skills 6


 - Model using the Word Matrix with the word running. Write the word _running_
on the board. Ask students the base word. ( _run_ ) Ask students the suffix.
( _–ing_ ) Underline _–ing_ . Write the base word run on the matrix.


 - Ask students how many syllables are in the word _run._ ( _one_ ) Ask if it has a
short or long vowel. ( _short_ )


 - Explain that because _run_ is a one-syllable word that has a short vowel sound
and ends in a single consonant, we add an extra ‘n’ before adding the _–ing_
to _run_ . _Run_ turns into _running_ . Write running on the matrix in the _–ing_ box.
Circle the double ‘n’ in _running_ .


 - Write _runing_ ( _running_ without the double consonant) on the board. Ask
students how we would pronounce this word differently if we hadn’t added
the double ‘n’ to the word. _(it would have a long ‘u’ sound)_


 - Explain that this is true for some other suffixes as well: _–ed_ and – _er_ .


 - Display Suffix Spelling: Double the Final Consonant (Digital Component 10.1).


 - Point to the word _shop_ and ask students to read the word aloud. Point to the
suffix _–ing_ . Write the new word in the third column: _shopping_ . Practice using
the matrix to map out each new word.


 - Ask students to read the new word aloud and discuss with a shoulder partner
what they notice about the new spelling. Suggest the following sentence
starter: “I noticed…” _(the ‘p’_ _was doubled because the letter ‘o’ in shop is short)._


 - Have students collaborate with a partner and repeat with the rest of the
suffixes from the chart.


 - Call on students to share an example that they had discussed with their partner.


~~**PRACTICE WITH READING AND DICTATION (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 10.1, and pass out copies of TR 10.1 to
students.


 - Ask students to point to the first word: _gripper_ .


 - Ask: What is the base word and the suffix?


 - Student: The base word is _grip_, and the suffix is _–er_ .


 - Ask students to circle the double consonants and underline the suffix.


 - Use sound-by-sound blending to decode _gripper_ .


 - Ask students to read all five blending words, annotating the consonants and
the suffix.

 - Direct students to the blank lines. Explain that they will listen as you say each
word once, then listen again and write the word. Direct students to complete
the responses in cursive: _shopping_, _plugged_, _spotter_, _dripping_, _skipped_ .


 - After dictating words, have students read the words, annotate the consonants
and the suffix, and write two sentences containing two of the words. Remind
students to write neatly in cursive, leaving space between words.


 - Circulate and monitor to check for correct letter formation in cursive. Provide
corrective feedback. Offer feedback such as:


   - “Check that your loops and tails are formed smoothly and connect to the
next letter.”


   - “Check the spacing between your words. Make sure there’s enough room
between each word to maintain readability.”

- Pair students with intentional reading partners.


- Remind students that they have learned about base words with the suffixes
_–ing, –ed,_ and _–er_, and how to double the consonant in the base word when
we add these suffixes.


- Write the word _hop_ on the board. Explain that this base word is in today’s
chapter.


- Add the suffix _–ing_ and ask students to read the word as you run your finger
underneath it. Ask students to speak coherently and discuss with their
partner how adding this suffix changes the meaning of the word. Suggest the
sentence starter: The action . . . ( _is happening now_ )


- Erase _–ing_ and add the suffix _–ed_ . Ask students to read the word as you run
your finger underneath it. Ask students to discuss with their partner how
adding this suffix changes the meaning of the word. Suggest the sentence
starter: The action . . . ( _has already happened_ )


Foundational Skills 6


  - Erase _–ed_ and add the suffix _–er_ . Ask students to read the word as you run
your finger underneath it. Ask students to discuss with their partner how
adding this suffix changes the meaning of the word. Suggest the sentence
starter: The word changed from ___ to ___, and that means ___ ( _The word_
_changed from a verb to a noun, and that means something, or someone, is_
_doing an action._ )


  - Guide the class in partner reading Chapter 8 in _To the Stars._


  - Today, students will follow these Partner Reading routines.


1. Open Reader.


2. Partner up.


3. Take turns reading paragraphs.

  - Have students repeat these steps back to you and then have them start the
Partner Reading routine.


  - Ask students to find their reading partners.


  - Direct reading partners to focus on reading with appropriate pace and
pronunciation of words. (Example: Model how to pronounce words clearly
and accurately, paying attention to individual sounds, stress patterns, and
word endings. Demonstrate how to decode unfamiliar words by breaking
them down into phonetic elements and sounding them out systematically.)


  - As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record. Record notes about
mispronunciations, self-correction, pacing, transposition of words, and
expression.


  - Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension, as well as to check
for their ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or
multiple-meaning words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant
questions to clarify any information from the Reader or prompts. Example
prompts include:


1. **Literal.** What subjects do astronauts need to know a lot about? _(Astronauts_
_need to know a lot about engineering, science, and math, and they may need_
_to learn other languages.)_


2. **Inferential.** Why did Neil Armstrong’s statement upon stepping onto the
moon hold significant meaning, according to David? _(David found Neil_
_Armstrong’s statement meaningful, as it demonstrated humans’ capability to_
_explore distant places far from Earth.)_

 - Read the first word, _surprise_, and add each suffix aloud: _surprising_, _surprised_,
_surpriser._ Tell students that when deciding which suffix to use, they should
decide which suffixes make the most sense. While _surpriser_ is truly a word,
it is not a word we typically use in our common speech. Decide to use
_surprised_, which is the past tense form of the word _surprise_ in a sentence.
Write on the board: _I was surprised to walk in the door and see all my friends_
_on my birthday._

  - Ask students to Think-Pair-Share to answer the questions:


    - What does it mean to read at an appropriate rate? What is an appropriate
rate? Suggest the sentence starter “An appropriate reading rate depends
on factors such as . . .” _(not reading too quickly or too slowly)_


  - If you read too slowly, what can you do to improve? Suggest the sentence
starter “If I read too slowly, I can practice . . .” _(reading the words that I get_
_stuck on, etc.)_


    - Why is it not beneficial to read too quickly? Suggest the sentence starter
“If I read too quickly, then . . .” _(I may not remember what I read about; if I_
_am reading to someone else, they may not understand me.)_


  - Model partner reading with a fluent reader at an appropriate pace,
alternating reading sentences, and modeling reading too quickly or too

 - Today, students will follow these Partner Reading routines.


1. Open Reader.


2. Partner up.


3. Take turns reading paragraphs.


4. After reading, politely provide feedback to your partner about their
expression or self-correcting.


 - Have students repeat these steps back to you and then have them start the
Partner Reading routine.


 - Direct students to alternate reading paragraphs until the end of Chapter 7
on page 40. Remind students to practice reading at an appropriate pace,
rereading a sentence if it supports their reading fluency.


 - Have students evaluate each other’s reading by giving each other positive
feedback. Point out the sentence stems on Partner Reading Feedback (TR
9.2 from Unit 1). Remember to speak politely at all times to your partner.
Listen for effective student feedback. For example:


   - You read at an appropriate rate as we practiced.


   - You did a great job when you read with expression.


   - You corrected yourself when you made an error.


   - I like when you read with excitement about walking on the moon.


 - Identify trends in student partner reading. Provide the class batch feedback
to support future partner reading.


 - As needed use the Grade 3 Fluency Record to track students’ ability to read
with appropriate rate, prosody, and accuracy. Provide feedback such as,
“Adjust your pitch to emphasize important words or ideas. This helps convey
the meaning and emotion in the text.”


Observation: Anecdotal Reading Record


As students partner read, note students’ fluency, including accuracy, rate, and prosody

pause and self-correct if
they miss a word, using
sentence frames “I think it
says ___.” or “Let me try to
read that word one more
time.”


Intermediate
Pair students and have
them write sentences from
the Reader on sentence
strips or index cards. Ask
them to mix them up and
work collaboratively with
a partner to discuss and
arrange the sentences,
taking turns reading and
listening to their partner
to confirm the correct
order together.


Advanced/Advanced High
Have students select a
short passage from the
Reader and set a reading
fluency goal (e.g., words
per minute). Ask them to
read the selected passage

~~**ADD SUFFIXES: CHANGE ‘Y’ TO ‘I’ (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask: What are the two ways to add suffixes that we have already discussed in this
unit? _(doubling the consonant, dropping the ‘e’ before adding a vowel suffix)_


  - Have students turn and talk to discuss these questions:


    - How do we know we need to double a consonant before adding a
suffix? _(the word ends in a CVC syllable)_ What are some examples?
_(eavesdropping, beginning)_


    - When do we drop the ‘e’ before adding a vowel suffix? _(the word ends in a_
_VCe syllable)_ What are some examples? _(promising, fascinating)_


  - Tell students they will continue working with suffixes today, using base words
that end in ‘y’.


  - Write the following words on the board: _apply, applies, applied_ .


  - Read each word.


    - Ask: How are their spellings similar, and how are they different? _(They are_
_similar because they all contain the base word_ apply _. They are different_
_because they have different endings.)_


  - Underline the _–es_ and _–ed_ suffixes. Remind students that adding _–ed_ to a
word means that it happened in the past.


  - Explain to students that when a word ends with a consonant and ‘y’, we
change the ‘y’ to ‘i’ before adding a suffix.


  - Tell students that this rule does not apply when adding the suffix _–ing_ .

**Note to Teacher**


Today you will begin the multipart Unit 6 Assessment. In the first part, you
will work one-on-one with students to complete the Fluency Assessment.
Students will engage in a review activity while awaiting their turn for the
assessment. You will most likely need more than one day to assess each
student; you may plan on using time during Lesson 15 to complete the
Fluency Assessment. You will need to reference the Grade 3 End-of-Year
Summary from Lesson 1 of Unit 1.


The second part of the assessment takes place in Lesson 15. It is a reading
and spelling exercise targeting each of the skills taught in Unit 6.


**Reading**

 - Prepare copies of the Self-Sustained Reading Tracker (TR 14.1) for students
to record their reading progress during independent reading time.


 - Create intentional pairs for checking answers to the Word Sort.


 - Prepare sentence stems to provide to students:


   - This part of the book reminds me of __ because __.


**Universal Access**

 - Differentiate the degree of difficulty of the Word Sort by customizing word
sets for students according to mastery of unit concepts. Allow students to
practice in small groups, with a partner, or individually.


 - Provide books of varying complexity for students to choose from during selfsustained reading time. Consider both quantitative and qualitative factors
when selecting book options. Offer a variety of genres. Encourage students
to explore any books that interest them regardless of their reading level.


 - Provide a means for students to record themselves fluently reading aloud a
poem or giving a speech.

 - When the student finishes reading the story, write the exact Finish Time in
minutes and seconds on your record sheet.


 - Alternatively, if you are using a stopwatch, simply write down the Elapsed
Time in minutes and seconds.


 - If the student reads very slowly, you may need to stop the reading before the
student gets to the end of the story. (Five minutes should be enough time to
get a measurement.) If the student does not read to the end, draw a vertical
line on the record sheet to indicate how far the student read. Also write down
either the Finish Time or the Elapsed Time.


 - Repeat this process for additional students.


 - Direct the student to read and select the correct answer for each question on
Activity Page 14.3. Encourage them to reference the text as they respond.


Activity Page 14.2: Fluency Assessment


If the reading was fairly accurate (<10 uncorrected errors), you can get a rough (and

easy) estimate of a student’s W.C.P.M. score simply by noting the time and looking at the

chart on the Unit 6 W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet. (TR 15.1)



Challenge


Have students record
themselves fluently
reading aloud a poem or
giving a speech.


Activity Page 14.3



Lesson 14 Fluency Assessment

**148**



To calculate a student’s exact W.C.P.M. score, follow the described steps.


   - First, complete the Words section of the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


   - Count Words Read. This is the total number of words that the student
read or attempted to read, up to the point where they stopped. It
includes words that the student read correctly as well as words that the
student read incorrectly or skipped over. If the student attempted to
read the whole story, including the title, use 292 words as your total. If
the student did not finish the story, you will need to count the number of
words that the student actually attempted to read. Write the count for
Words Read in the matching box on the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


   - Count the Uncorrected Mistakes noted in your running record. This
includes words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and words
that you had to supply. Write the total in the box labeled Uncorrected
Mistakes. (A mistake that is corrected by the student is not counted as
a mistake; the student is penalized for the time they lost making the
correction, but not for the initial mistake.)


   - Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get Words Correct.


   - Next, complete the Time section of the activity page.


   - Calculate Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a
stopwatch, this should already be done for you. Skip to the next step.)
If you used a watch and recorded start and stop times, you will need to
subtract the Start Time from the Finish Time to calculate the Elapsed
Time. Subtract seconds from seconds, then minutes from minutes.
Calculate Time in seconds. Multiply the number of minutes by 60 to
convert minutes to seconds, and then add the number of seconds.


   - Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then multiply by 60 to get
Words Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.).


 - As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider:


   - It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.
scores. However, a major goal for Grade 3 students is to read with
sufficient fluency to ensure comprehension and independent reading of
school assignments in subsequent grades. Exact fluency targets vary
from state to state; the national mean calculated by Hasbrouck and
Tindal in 2017 for Winter of Grade 3 is 97 W.C.P.M.


   - A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared with the score of other
students in the classroom (or grade level) and also with the national
fluency norms for Winter of Grade 3 obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal.
Students whose scores are below the 25th percentile (79 W.C.P.M.) are
experiencing serious problems in reading fluently.


Foundational Skills 6


  - Compare the student’s W.C.P.M. score to national norms for Winter of Grade
3 (Hasbrouck and Tindal, 2017):

|Reading Time for<br>this Text|W.C.P.M.|National Percentiles for<br>Winter, Grade 3|
|---|---|---|
|2:35|141|90th|
|3:05|137|75th|
|4:05|97|50th|
|5:55|79|25th|
|8:00|62|10th|



  - After you have entered each student’s scores on the Unit 6 W.C.P.M
Calculation Sheet, record them on the Grade 3 End-of-Year Summary for
each student.

Foundational Skills 6


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today you will complete the multipart Unit 6 Assessment. The Reading
& Spelling portion of the Assessment takes place during the first twenty
minutes of this lesson. Use the Reading Assessment Scoring and Analysis
(TR 15.2) and Spelling Assessment Scoring and Analysis (TR 15.3) to help
determine and understand which phonemes and words students missed.
Once students have completed the assessment, they will have time for quiet
recreational reading. Use time in this lesson to finish working with students
who did not complete the Fluency Assessment in the previous lesson.


You may also use Pausing Point days to administer the optional Tricky Word
Assessment included in Teacher Resources to specific students that you
suspect may not have thoroughly mastered the Tricky Words and highfrequency words reviewed in this unit.


**Foundational Skills**

  - Provide colored pencils for students to use when checking and correcting
their spelling on Activity Page 15.2.


  - As needed, prepare a copy of the optional Unit 6 Tricky Word Assessment and
the Unit 6 Tricky Word Assessment List.


  - Locate and provide audio books for students to listen to as an alternative to/
support for silent reading.


  - Prepare sentence stems to provide to students:


    - In the text, I learned that __, which is important because __.


**Reading**

  - Consider preparing games used in previous lessons in this unit for review to
be available as an optional activity after assessments.


  - Gather books of varying complexity for students to choose from during SelfSustained Reading time. Students should continue listing out books read on
the Self-Sustained Reading Tracker (TR 14.1.)


**Universal Access**

  - Provide opportunities for self-directed breaks during recreational reading.

#### Pausing Point


This is the end of Unit 6. Analyze the results from the Unit 6 Assessments
in the two previous lessons and determine which skills in the unit students
need to review. Pause here and spend one or two days providing targeted
acceleration in the specific areas of weakness. This is also a good time to
expand the abilities of students who can go further and need a challenge.
Students can do any combination of the exercises listed below, in any
order. The exercises are listed by unit objectives. You may find that different
students need extra practice with different objectives. It can be helpful to
have students focus on specific exercises in small groups.

**Split the Syllables**

 - Have students open to Activity Page PP.1.


 - Direct students to read the sentences and syllabicate the bolded words on
the line below.


 - Remind students to write neatly in cursive.


**Syllable Division Evaluation**

 - Have students open to Activity Page PP.2.


 - Instruct students to carefully examine the multisyllabic words divided into
syllables in the first column.


 - If the word is correctly divided, have students write the word _correct_ in the
second column.


 - If the word is incorrectly divided, have students write the correct syllable
division in the second column.


 - Remind students to write neatly in cursive, leaving space between words.


~~**MORE HELP WITH CONTRACTIONS**~~


**Writing Contractions**

 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page PP.3.


 - Ask students to point to the first words in the first column: _we will_ .


 - Draw attention to the contraction next to it in the second column: _we’ll_ .


 - Ask: Which letters will the apostrophe replace to make a contraction with
these two words? _(‘w’ and ‘i’ in the word_ will)


 - Explain that on some rows, they will need to fill in the contraction and, on
some rows, they will need to fill in the two original words. Direct students to
complete the responses in cursive.


**Mix and Mingle**

 - Explain that students will play a game called Mix and Mingle to create as
many contractions as possible.


 - Pass out one Mix and Mingle word card per student. Note: Some words are
repeated, and you may copy more if you have more than 20 students.


Foundational Skills 6



**158**


 - Explain that once the timer begins, students will “mix and mingle” with each
other to create contractions using their flashcards. Once they’ve combined
their flashcards to create a contraction, they must each individually write the
contraction down on Activity Page PP.4. They will then repeat the process to
create a new word with different students.


 - Model how to combine flashcards to create a contraction, with the cards _is_
and _not._


 - Remind students that in order for their word to count, it must be spelled
correctly. Direct students to write words in cursive.


 - Begin the timer and release students to play the game.


 - Refocus the class. Ask for student volunteers to share the words they
created. Review the correct spellings for words that students spelled
incorrectly.


 - Extend the activity by having students write sentences on the lines below,
using contractions. Remind students to write neatly in cursive, leaving space
between words.


**Contraction Concentration**

 - Move students into pairs.


 - Distribute a set of Contraction Concentration Cards to each pair.


 - Direct students to shuffle the cards and lay them out on the table facedown.


 - Explain that one partner at a time will flip over two cards. If the cards match,
meaning that one card displays a contraction and the other displays the two
words that the contraction stands for, that partner gets to keep those two
cards.


 - If the cards do not match, they flip them back over and the play continues to
the next partner.


~~**MORE HELP WITH SUFFIXES**~~


**Mystery Word**

 - Ask students for examples of base words with suffixes added that use the
taught suffix rules: double the final consonant, drop the silent ‘e’, and change
‘y’ to ‘i’.

- List the words on the board.


- Once you have compiled a list of suffix words, make a statement about one
of the words or ideas listed, such as “This word uses the double the final
consonant rule. It is a verb that tells how a person might get from one place
to another.” _(running)_


- Encourage students to guess the word from the list. Add more hints as
needed.


- Have students work with partners, where one partner gives verbal clues
about a chosen word on the board and the other partner guesses. Encourage
them to provide verbal clues related to the suffix rules as well as the word
meaning.


- Lead a brief, whole-class discussion of clues that students gave.


- Nominate or ask a student volunteer to come to the front of the room and
stand facing the class with their back to the board.


- Point to a word from the generated list and ask other students to give clues
for the student volunteer to guess and pronounce the word.


- Remind students that in this activity, they should not use gestures but should
instead rely on verbal hints to help their classmate guess the word.


- Continue as time allows.

The following box contains all of the Tricky Words for Unit 6.







**Tricky Word and High-Frequency Word Baseball**

  - Divide the class into two teams. Have one team at a time come to the front of
the room and line up in front of the Tricky Word and High-Frequency Baseball
Game Board.


  - To play, teams take turns “at bat”:


    - Pick a card from the Tricky and High-Frequency Word Baseball Word
Cards and ask the first person on the team to read it.


    - If the word is read correctly, draw a line from home plate to first base,
signifying a “hit.” This player should go to the back of the team’s line
while the next player comes forward to read the next card. If the second
player reads the word correctly, draw a line from first to second base.


Pausing Point
**161**


Activity Page PP.5




   - Play continues in this way, so that each time a player reads a word
correctly, you draw a line to the next base. If the fourth player reads the
word correctly, draw a line from third base to home plate and mark “1
run” for this team.


 - Play continues for the members of this team so long as no words are
misread. When a word is misread, the next team takes its turn at bat.


   - As in the actual game of baseball, any players “left on base” when a word
is misread do not count or add to the score.


**Fill-in-the-Blank Sentence Trade**

 - Have students open to Activity Page PP.5.


 - Ask students to create sentences containing the selected Tricky Words from
the word box, but leaving a blank space where the word should be.


 - After completing their sentences, students exchange papers with another
student. Each student then attempts to fill in the blanks in the sentences
they received, using theTricky and high-frequency words provided.


~~**MORE HELP WITH READING AND FLUENCY**~~


**Book Club**

 - Divide students into groups.


 - Have students read any of the Unit 1–6 readers or an approved trade book.


 - Assign students the following roles:


   - Reader Leader: The Reader Leader’s responsibility is to read aloud a
portion of the decodable reader during each book circle meeting. They
should demonstrate fluency, clear pronunciation, and expressive reading
to engage the group and enhance comprehension.


   - Discussion Director: The Discussion Director leads the group in
discussing key elements of the story, such as characters, setting,
plot events, and main ideas. They may pose open-ended questions to
encourage critical thinking and facilitate meaningful conversations
among the members.


   - Word Wiz: The Word Wiz focuses on identifying and understanding
unfamiliar words encountered during reading. They help the group
decipher the meanings of these words through context clues, word
analysis strategies, and discussions. The Word Wiz may also lead
vocabulary-building activities to deepen comprehension and expand
students’ word knowledge.


Foundational Skills 6



**162**


    - Timekeeper: The Timekeeper helps ensure that the book circle stays
on track and manages the allotted time for each activity or discussion.
They use a timer or clock to monitor the duration of reading sessions,
discussions, and transitions between roles. The Timekeeper gently
reminds the group when it’s time to move on to the next activity, helping
maintain focus and productivity throughout the book circle meeting.

Teacher Instructions: Create one copy of the Foundational Skills Record per student. Use assessments
within the unit to track the student’s progress toward mastery of each standard. Use the rating system
to indicate the level of teacher support required and the space provided to take notes.


  - Students at level 1 require focused instruction to accelerate learning in a specific area. Use the
Additional Supports and Pausing Points to target areas of growth.


  - Students at levels 2 and 3 should be showing steady growth. These students would benefit from the
Take Home Materials and side-bar support suggestions within each lesson.


  - Students at level 4 are excelling. Use the side-bar challenge suggestions to increase rigor.

###### Grade 3 Fluency Record

Choose texts from the Grade 3 Fluency Packet or the Unit Readers for students to read aloud
as you measure their pace and accuracy. Subtract the Words Missed (words that are omitted,
mispronounced, or substituted for another word) from the Total Words in Text to determine the
number of Words Read Correctly. Divide the Words Read Correctly by the Total Words in Text to
determine the students’ accuracy. Record how long it takes the students to read the passage to
determine their Words Per Minute. Consider both accuracy and pace as well as expression when
evaluating a student’s overall fluency.

**Review Suffix Rules**


**Double the final consonant:** One-syllable words with a
short vowel sound and a single consonant ending change
to a double-letter spelling at the end when _–ing_ is added
(example: run/running).


**Drop the silent ‘e’:** When a word ends in silent ‘e’ and you
add a vowel suffix like _–ed, –er,_ and _–ing_, you drop the ‘e’
(example: bake/baking).


**Change ‘y’ to ‘i’:** When a word ends with a consonant and
‘y,’ we change the ‘y’ to ‘i’ before adding _–ed_ or _–er_ (example:
reply/replied).

**Reading Assessment Scoring and Analysis**


The more words a student can read and the farther the
student can progress in the assessment, the stronger his or
her preparation for the next unit of instruction.


**The number of words read correctly indicates the**
**following:**


- Students who score 6 or fewer words out of 10 words
correctly have minimal preparation for the next unit.


- Students who score 7 out of 10 words correctly have
adequate preparation for the next unit.


- Students who score 8 or more words out of 10 words
correctly have outstanding preparation for the next unit.


After scoring the assessment, you might find it helpful to
determine which phonemes students missed that caused
them to score below the benchmark for word recognition.

**Spelling Assessment Scoring and Analysis**


The words on today’s spelling assessment include
contractions and words that drop the final ‘e’, change the
‘y’ to ‘i’, and double final consonants.


Place an X in the column of any word that the student did
not spell correctly. Examine errors for patterns using the
information provided below. If a pattern is identified, speak
with the student and ask him or her to explain his or her
thinking to you. This may help you understand the student’s
confusion and allow you to clear up the misunderstanding.

**Unit 6 Tricky Word Assessment (Optional)**


Student Name: _________________


Instructions: This is an optional assessment of Tricky Words
and high-frequency words reviewed in this unit. At the end of
Unit 6, show the student the Tricky Word list that follows this
record. Ask the student to read each word from the list,
proceeding in order from top to bottom.


Provide the student with either a blank sheet of paper or
cardstock to place on the word list page directly under the row
he or she is reading. As the student completes a row, he or she
should slide the paper down just enough to read the next row.


Record the student’s performance on each word in the
following chart, using + to indicate that the word was read
correctly and – to indicate the word was read incorrectly; if the
student misreads a completely different word in its place,
record the word read by the student. Mark as incorrect any
word that the student does not read within 3–5 seconds.

#### Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program


~~**THE SIMPLE VIEW OF READING**~~


Virtually everyone who writes about reading now recognizes that reading comprehension requires
more than just decoding ability. Many reading researchers now subscribe to a view of reading that
is known as “the simple view of reading.” This view, which is associated with reading researchers
Philip Gough and William Tunmer, holds that there are two chief elements that are crucially
important to reading comprehension: decoding skills and language comprehension ability.


To achieve reading comprehension, a person needs to be able to decode the words on the page
and then make sense of those words. The first task is made possible by decoding skills and the
second by language comprehension ability. If the person cannot decode the words on the page,
they will not be able to achieve reading comprehension, no matter how much oral language they
can understand. Even if the person can decode the words on the page, that in and of itself is still no
guarantee of reading comprehension. Thus, if a person cannot understand sentences when they
hear them, they are unlikely to understand those sentences when reading. Supporters of the simple
view—and there are a growing number of them among reading researchers—argue that a person’s
reading comprehension ability can be predicted, with a high degree of accuracy, based on two basic
measures. The first is a measure of decoding skills (e.g., a test of single word reading or pseudo-word
reading). The second is a measure of listening comprehension. Researchers who hold to the simple
view say, “Tell me a person’s decoding ability, as ascertained by a word-reading task, and tell me that
person’s language comprehension ability, as ascertained by a listening comprehension task, and I
can make a very accurate prediction of that person’s reading comprehension ability.” If the person
is an efficient and accurate decoder and able to understand a wide range of oral language—for
instance, classroom presentations, news items on the radio or TV, books on tape, etc.—then it is a
safe bet the person will also do well on tests of reading comprehension.


An interesting thing about the simple view of reading is that it can be expressed as an equation:





In this equation, each of the letters is a variable that stands for a specific skill:


R is a measure of reading comprehension ability.


D is a measure of decoding skills.


C is a measure of language-comprehension ability as measured using a listening task.


Teacher Resources **233**


Each of these skills can be quantified as a numerical value between 0 and 1, where 0 stands for no
ability whatsoever and 1 stands for perfect, not-to-be-improved-upon ability. Most people have a
skill level that falls somewhere between these two extremes.


The equation says that if you have some decoding ability (D > 0) and you also have some language
comprehension ability (C > 0), you will probably also have some reading comprehension ability
(R > 0). How much reading comprehension ability you have will depend on the exact values of
D and C.


What does it mean to have no decoding ability (D = 0)? It means you cannot turn printed words
into spoken words. A person who cannot decode letters on a page cannot read. The person is
illiterate.


What does it mean to have no language comprehension ability (C = 0)? It means you do not know
the language, and you cannot understand any of it when you hear other people speaking or reading
aloud in that language.


It is not very common for a person to have decoding ability (D > 0) but not language
comprehension ability (C = 0). Why would you learn to read and write a language you cannot
understand? It does happen. One famous example involves the English poet John Milton, the
author of _Paradise Lost_ and other well-known poems. Milton went blind late in life. Since Braille had
not yet been invented, this meant he could not read for himself. Nevertheless, Milton found a way
to keep learning from books: he had friends and relatives read the books aloud for him. However,
he was not always able to find a scholar who had the free time and the ability needed to read to him
in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and other ancient languages. The solution? Milton taught his daughters
to decode these languages so they could read books in those languages aloud to him. Milton did
not teach his daughters the actual languages—the thousands of words and tens of thousands
of meanings. That would have been a difficult, time-consuming task. He only taught them the
rules they would need to turn letters into sounds. Thus, his daughters acquired solid decoding
skills for these languages (D > 0), but they would have scored a zero on any measure of language
comprehension (C = 0). They could turn symbols into sounds, but they had no idea what the
sounds meant. Milton, on the other hand, due to his blindness, had no functional decoding skills (D
= 0). However, by virtue of his great learning, he was able to understand Hebrew, Latin, and Greek
when they were read aloud to him (C > 0). Between Milton and his daughters, you might say, there
was reading comprehension (R), but the younger generation brought the decoding skills (D) and
the elderly poet brought the language comprehension (C).


The Milton example is an unusual one, but it is possible to give a less unusual one. A decent teacher
can teach you to decode Russian letters (or the letters used in many other writing systems) during
a couple days of intensive work. Since you already know a lot about reading, all you would need to
learn is which sound values the unfamiliar letters stand for. Once you learned that, you would be
able to sound out most of the words in the language, but nobody would claim that you are reading
Russian. You would have some rudimentary decoding skills (D > 0), but you would be lacking
language comprehension (C = 0). You would be able to pronounce words, but you would not be able
to make sense of them. Essentially, you would be doing what Milton’s daughters did.


**234** Foundational Skills 6


~~**HOW THESE IDEAS INFORM THIS PROGRAM**~~


Although this may seem very abstract and theoretical, there are two ideas here that are very
important for reading instruction and for understanding this program. The first important idea
is that reading comprehension depends crucially on both decoding skills (D) and language
comprehension ability (C); the second is that language comprehension ability takes much longer
to acquire than decoding skills.


Milton chose to teach his daughters decoding skills because he could teach those relatively
quickly. It would have taken him much, much longer to build up their language comprehension
abilities. Likewise, in the hypothetical example just given, a decent teacher could teach you to
decode Russian print in a few days of intensive instruction, but he or she would need to keep
working with you for many weeks—possibly even many years—to teach you enough Russian words
and phrases to understand a movie, make sense of a radio report, or read a short story.


You are facing a similar situation as a teacher in the early grades. You want your students to learn
to read. A crucial first step is to teach them decoding skills. Strong decoding skills can be taught
to most young children throughout Grades K–3. It takes longer to teach decoding skills to young
children who are learning to read for the first time than it does to teach the same skills to adults
who have already learned to read in another language, and it takes longer to teach decoding
skills in English-speaking countries because English spelling is rather complex; but even so,
most students can acquire basic decoding ability in the early grades. The children will continue
to automatize their decoding skills, learn new spelling patterns, and build fluency for many more
years, but the basics can be taught in Grades K–3.


That is not the case with language comprehension ability. It will take you and your school system a
long time to build up your students’ language comprehension ability because this is not a job you can
accomplish in a single school year. Rather, language comprehension ability is acquired over many
years. Your students began to develop a rudimentary ability to understand language even before
they could speak and continued to increase their language comprehension abilities throughout the
preschool years. They will make even more gains in your classroom and the classrooms they join
after yours. With each new sentence they read or hear, and each new subject they study in school,
they will be building up background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural literacy, thus increasing
the range of materials they are equipped to understand, first orally and later via reading. The more
you teach them and the more you expose them to, the more they will be able to understand. It takes
a long time to build up the vocabulary and knowledge needed to make sense of most stories in a
newspaper or magazine, but this buildup is crucial for your students’ reading abilities: no matter
how good their decoding skills may be, they will not understand what they read unless they have the
language comprehension ability to make sense of the words they decode.


The program includes two strands of instruction, and these strands correspond with the
elements of reading isolated in the simple view of reading. The Skills Strand is meant to build
students’ decoding skills (D), while the Knowledge Strand is meant to build students’ language
comprehension ability (C) by exposing them to vocabulary, concepts, and ideas through
frequent reading aloud. It is important to understand that both strands are crucial for reading


Teacher Resources **235**


comprehension in later grades. You may feel the decoding skills taught in the Skills Strand are
more important to teach in the early grades, and certainly, this is the area where you can expect to
have the most immediate impact, but it is important that you not neglect language comprehension
ability. Remember, it takes many years to build up enough vocabulary and general knowledge to
understand a wide range of printed materials. The building of background knowledge needs to begin
in kindergarten (if not before) and continue throughout the elementary and middle school years.


If students are not building their language comprehension ability in the early grades, their reading
scores are likely to begin to fall off in Grade 4 and later. This has been called the “fourth-grade
slump,” and it occurs because material assessed on reading tests changes over time. As students’
progress through the grades, test questions focus less on rudimentary decoding skills and more
on comprehension—and comprehension depends on having sufficient vocabulary, background
knowledge, and cultural literacy to understand the words you are decoding. Thus, the importance
of language comprehension ability increases with time. A weakness in this area may not show up
on tests in early grades, but it will show up in later elementary grades.


This has been well documented in research. In one very interesting study, researchers at the
University of Kansas looked at measurements of reading comprehension (R), decoding/word
recognition (D), and listening comprehension (C) for the same 570 students in the second, fourth,
and eighth grades. They found the two factors D and C accurately predicted R in each grade,
but that C became more important, in the sense that it explained more of the variation among
students over time. The measure of decoding (D) was extremely important in the second-grade
results. Twenty-seven percent of the variance in reading comprehension in second grade could
be explained by decoding skills (D) alone. Only 9 percent of the variance could be explained
by listening comprehension (C) alone. By fourth grade, however, the measure of listening
comprehension had begun to account for more variance: the unique contribution of C rose to 21
percent, while the equivalent number for D fell. By eighth grade, fully 36 percent of the variance
in reading comprehension scores could be explained with reference to the children’s listening
comprehension ability. The unique contribution of D sank even further. In other words, while
reading comprehension depended on D and C at every stage, as the simple view would predict,
C explained more and more of the variation among students as time went by. What this tells us
is that, once the intricacies of decoding are mastered (and in English, this takes some time),
reading comprehension depends more and more heavily on language comprehension. Language
comprehension depends on background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural literacy.


~~**TWO MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT READING AND WRITING**~~


The Skills Strand teaches the mechanics of both reading and writing. It is based on the most current
research on reading and writing, but at the same time, it has been written in opposition to some ideas
that have been very influential in elementary education in recent decades. Two of those ideas are:


Learning to read and write is natural.


Learning to read and write is easy.


Both ideas have great emotional appeal. Unfortunately, both are wrong.


**236** Foundational Skills 6


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT NATURAL**~~


Many scholars have argued that spoken language is natural for human beings. The cognitive
scientist Stephen Pinker, for example, has argued that human beings have a language instinct,
meaning that humans are born with an innate capacity for learning language. This may turn out to
be true. It is at least a plausible theory since historians, linguists, and anthropologists have never
found a human culture that does not use language. When something is universal, it may turn out to
be natural.


What is true of oral language is not necessarily true of written language. In fact, with written
language, we know we are dealing with something that is not natural or innate because we know
when and where writing was invented, and we know that, even today, not all languages have a
system of writing. There are still hundreds of languages in the world that are spoken but not
written or read.


Ten thousand years ago this was the norm rather than an exception. At that time, there were
probably no human beings who knew how to read or write. According to the linguist Florian
Coulmas, the idea of writing down language was probably developed independently by three
ancient cultures: the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, and the Chinese. Each used a slightly different
system, and the mechanisms these pioneers developed for recording speech then spread from one
culture to another, evolving as they went. If these initial inventors had not come up with schemes
for writing down speech, we might all be illiterate today.


Writing is many things. It is an art that can be taught and learned. It is an invention—one of the
greatest inventions in human history. It is a technology enabling us to do things we could not do
without it—a technology every bit as exciting and amazing as airplane flight or electric power. But
it is not natural. The same is true of reading, which is simply the process of unpacking, or decoding,
what somebody else has written.


Reading and writing are both highly artificial. We tend to recoil at that word. We have internalized
the idea that natural is good and artificial is bad. Therefore, we think reading must be natural. In
fact, as the reading researcher Philip Gough has written, reading is a highly unnatural act.


The first step toward good reading and writing instruction is to understand that reading and
writing are artificial—but not necessarily in a bad sense. We need to remind ourselves that the
word _artificial_ derives from the word _art_ . To say reading and writing are forms of art that had to be
invented and need to be taught to children does not make reading and writing any less wonderful
or important. On the contrary, it makes these things more wonderful and precious, and it also
emphasizes the importance of your job as a teacher. There is no job more important than teaching
young children the magnificent, valuable, and highly unnatural arts of reading and writing.


Teacher Resources **237**


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT EASY**~~


The second idea noted earlier, that learning to read and write is easy, is also mistaken. Reading and
writing are complex behaviors, and they are more complex in English than in many other languages
because English has a complicated spelling system. In Spanish, for example, the relationships
between letters and sounds are mostly one-to-one, meaning each sound is usually written with
one spelling, and each spelling unit is usually pronounced one way. This is not the case in English.
To read and write English with a high degree of accuracy, there is quite a lot that students need to
learn.


As a way of demonstrating the complexity involved in learning to read and write in English, suppose
we attempted to list all the discrete bits of information a person needs to know to be able to read
and write in English. As a starting point, we might begin with the 26 letters and argue that these
are the 26 things one really needs to learn to read and write English. However, for each letter, one
eventually needs to learn not only the letter shape but also the letter name (to be able to read
abbreviations and initials). So that is 52 bits of information.


That is a good start, but we must not stop there. In English, all letters can be written in uppercase
and lowercase forms, and the uppercase forms are not always the same as the lowercase forms.
Compare ‘B’ to ‘b’, ‘D’ to ‘d’, ‘H’ to ‘h’, ‘R’ to ‘r’, and ‘Q’ to ‘q’. At least 16 uppercase letters have a
slightly different form than the matching lowercase letters. So, we must raise our estimate of the
complexity of the English writing system to 68 bits of information.


We are not done yet. Students must also know the 44 sounds these letters stand for. That raises
our estimate of the complexity to 112.


If there was a simple one-to-one relationship between letters and sounds, that might be a good
estimate of the code’s complexity. Unfortunately, the relationships between sounds and letters in
English are quite complicated. The 44 sounds of English can be spelled many ways. In our work on
this program, we have identified 150 spellings that are frequent enough to be worth teaching in the
early grades. That boosts our estimate of the complexity of the code to 262.


In addition, students need to learn to track from left to right, blend sounds into words (when
reading), and segment words into sounds (when writing and spelling). They need to learn a handful
of symbols used in writing, including the period, comma, exclamation point, question mark,
quotation mark, and apostrophe. That raises our estimate of code complexity to about 270 bits of
information.


We could boost the estimate even higher by adding Tricky Words and unusual spellings or by
pointing out that many letters in English can be pronounced in different ways. We could also point
out that reading a word like _thin_ requires students to group the first two letters and attach them to
one sound, and reading a word like _cake_ requires students to scan ahead, see the ‘e,’ and realize it
controls the pronunciation of the ‘a’ earlier.


Even without these additions, the English writing system is quite complicated.


**238** Foundational Skills 6


~~**THE PROBLEM WITH WHOLE LANGUAGE**~~


On a conservative estimate, there are 270 bits of knowledge a person needs to be able to read and
write English. It is unwise to ask students to tackle all this complexity at once and hope they will
figure it out. Yet that is precisely what is done in so-called “Whole Language” approaches. Whole
Language instruction is based on the assumption that learning to read is natural and not difficult,
so reading skills can be allowed to develop gradually, without much explicit instruction. Lots of
students in Whole Language classrooms do manage to figure out the English writing system, but
many others do not. Whole Language ideas have tremendous emotional appeal, but the Whole
Language approach is actually a recipe for leaving many children behind. It is an especially risky
strategy for disadvantaged children.


A much better strategy is to introduce the English spelling code explicitly, beginning with the
easiest, least ambiguous, and most frequently used parts of the code and then adding complexity
gradually. That is the central strategy on which this program is based.


The strategy adopted in this program is the same strategy that successful coaches use when
teaching children a sport such as tennis. The successful coach does not ask students to learn
“Whole Tennis” and soak up the necessary skills all at once by trying to hit all different kinds of
shots the first day on the court. Instead, the successful coach teaches the student to hit a forehand
ground stroke and provides lots of practice hitting forehands. Then the coach moves on to teach
a backhand ground stroke, then a forehand volley, then a backhand volley, then a serve, then an
overhead smash, then a drop shot, etc. With each element taught, the student becomes a stronger
and more complete player. In the same way, this program begins by teaching the most common
and least ambiguous spellings for sounds and then moves on to introduce the more complex parts
of the writing system.


~~**KEY ASPECTS OF THE SKILLS STRAND**~~


Some key aspects of the Skills Strand are listed below as follows:


  - This program teaches reading and writing in tandem, since they are inverse processes. English
writing involves making pictures of sounds; reading involves translating those pictures back into
sounds and blending the sounds to make words.


  - This program includes explicit, systematic phonics instruction in which students are taught target
skills needed to independently decode and encode words This program explicitly teaches lettersound correspondences as opposed to leaving students to figure these out on their own or deduce
them by analyzing familiar whole words (as in some forms of “analytic” phonics).


  - This program focuses on sounds, or phonemes, as the primary organizing principle of the program,
rather than letters.


  - This program focuses consistently on the phoneme, or single sound, and not on larger units.
Students learn to read words that contain onsets, rimes, and consonant clusters, but they learn to
view and process these larger units as combinations of smaller phoneme-level units. Rimes like _–ick_
and initial clusters like _st–_ are not taught as units but as combinations.


Teacher Resources **239**


  - This program uses a synthetic phonics approach that teaches students to read by blending through
the whole word; it does not teach multiple cueing strategies, use of pictures as a primary resource in
decoding, or part-word guessing.


  - This program begins by teaching the most common or least ambiguous spelling for a sound (the
basic code spelling); later it teaches spelling alternatives for sounds that can be spelled several
different ways. Thus, the system is kept simple at first, and complexity is added bit by bit as
students gain confidence and automatize their reading and writing skills.


  - This program includes words, phrases, and stories for students to read and activity pages for
them to complete that allow for focused, distributed practice working with the letter-sound
correspondences they have been taught.


  - This program does not require students to read words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have learned. In other words, all words students are asked to read as
part of the program are decodable, either because they are composed entirely of letter-sound
correspondences students have been taught or because they are Tricky Words that have been
taught. This means students have a chance to begin reading words and stories that are completely
decodable before tackling words and stories that are full of spelling alternatives.


  - This program does not require students to write words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have been taught. In other words, students are only asked to write words that
can be spelled (at least plausibly if not always correctly) using the code knowledge they have been
taught.


  - This program carefully controls the introduction of Tricky Words and words with ambiguous or rare
spellings, preferring to have students learn to read and write with regular words that can be blended
and spelled by the letter-sound correspondences taught.


  - High-frequency words compiled from a research-based list for Grade 3 are also taught as they
appear in the Unit Readers. They are revisited frequently to build automaticity and fluency.


  - This program avoids letter names because what is important for reading is not the letter name but
the sound value the letter stands for. To read the word _cat_, it is essential to know /k/ /a/ /t/, not
“see aay tee.”


~~**THE BASIC AND ADVANCED CODE**~~


The program teaches the highly complex letter-sound correspondences of the English language
in an explicit and systematic manner in Kindergarten–Grade 3. Students are taught how the 26
letters (or graphemes) of the alphabet are used in various combinations to represent 44 sounds
(or phonemes). There are approximately 150 different spellings for these sounds.


Students are first taught the basic code for each of the 44 phonemes. The basic code spelling for
a sound is usually the most common, or the least ambiguous, spelling for a sound. By learning
these letter-sound correspondences first, students experience a high degree of predictability, and
therefore success, in decoding words with these spellings.


**240** Foundational Skills 6


Basic code spellings may be single letters, such as these spellings and sounds: ‘a’ > /a/, ‘e’ > /e/,
‘b’ > /b/, and ‘m’ > /m/. Basic code spellings may also include digraphs, or two letters to represent
a sound, such as ‘ee’ > /ee/, ‘oy’ > /oi/, ‘ou’ > /ow/, ‘sh’ > /sh/, and ‘th’ > /th/. Other basic code
spellings include separated digraphs, such as ‘a_e’ > /ae/, and ‘o_e’ > /oe/.


The advanced code consists of all other spelling alternatives (over 100) that may be used to spell
the 44 phonemes in English. Examples of alternative spellings include ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘ss’ > /s/, ‘c’

  - /s/, ‘g’ > /j/, ‘ay’ > /ae/, and ‘ey’ > /ee/. Some of these spelling alternatives occur relatively
frequently in the English language, while others are quite rare. See the charts provided for the
basic and advanced code.

~~**TRICKY WORDS**~~


The term _Tricky Word_ is used in this program to refer to a word that does not “play by the rules” of
spelling and/or pronunciation. Examples of Tricky Words include _one_, _said_, _of_, _were_, and _have_ .


You can describe the trickiness of a Tricky Word like _said_ in two ways. If you think about it from
a spelling point of view, you might say that the word said is tricky because the sound /e/ is not
spelled with an ‘e’, as you might expect it would be. On the other hand, if you think about it from a
reading point of view, you might say the word is tricky because the letters ‘ai’ are not pronounced
/ae/, as you might expect they would be. Either way you look at it, _said_ is a Tricky Word.


But notice that the word is not completely irregular, either. The first letter and the last letter are
pronounced exactly as you would expect. It is only the second and third letters, representing the
vowel sound, that are not sounded as you would expect. Or, if you prefer to look at things from the
speller’s perspective, you might say the first and last sound are spelled just as you would expect; it
is only the middle sound—the vowel sound—that is spelled irregularly. This is the case with many
Tricky Words: most of them have a regular part (or parts) and then a tricky part. You will find that
the tricky part involves the vowel sound and its spelling.


**242** Foundational Skills 6


When you are asked to teach a Tricky Word, the guidelines in the Teacher Guide will generally
prompt you to begin by reminding students that not all words play by the rules and words that do
not play by the rules are called Tricky Words. Next, the Teacher Guide generally suggests you write
the Tricky Word on the board. You may wish to ask a student to read the word as he or she thinks it
might be sounded (i.e., to blend according to the normal procedures). Alternatively, you can read
Tricky Word that way yourself. Then you can point out how the word is pronounced. Once you have
established the actual pronunciation, you can point out and/or discuss what is regular and what
is irregular about the word. Most Tricky Words have at least some parts pronounced exactly the
way you would expect. For example, as noted above, the first and last letter in _said_ are pronounced
just as one would expect. After discussing the regular parts, you should then draw attention to the
tricky part (or parts) of the word, pointing out letters not pronounced as one might expect they
would be (e.g., the ‘ai’ in _said_ ). This is the part of the word that students just must remember.


By drawing attention to the regular as well as the irregular parts of the word, you teach students
that Tricky Words are only partial exceptions to the normal rules of reading and writing. (They are
not so much irregular as they are a little less regular than most words.) There are some parts of
the word spelled as you would expect and pronounced as expected. Then there are some others
that are not. There is a subtle but important difference between teaching Tricky Words this way and
teaching them as single entities that must be memorized as wholes, as if every part of the word
were unpredictable.


Note that some Tricky Words are part of spelling patterns. For example, the words _he_, _she_, _we_,
_be_, and _me_ are taught as Tricky Words in earlier grades because it is hard to write stories without
them. However, once the ‘e’ spelling alternative for /ee/ is taught, these Tricky Words can be seen
as part of a larger pattern that includes words like _replay_ and _prefix_ . Other Tricky Words, such as
_one_ and _of_, remain tricky even when most of the spelling alternatives have been taught. By Grade
3, students have been taught the majority of the code knowledge needed to decode most words in
the English language. As such, there is less of an emphasis on Tricky Words in the Grade 3 program.


~~**SIGHT WORDS AND TRICKY WORDS**~~


One of the most common terms in the world of reading instruction is _sight word_ . Unfortunately, this
is also a rather ambiguous and potentially confusing term. Educators use the term _sight word_ in
two different senses. For some people, sight words are high-frequency words that students need to
encounter frequently and learn to decode rapidly and effortlessly. Other people use the term _sight_
_word_ in a more restrictive sense, to refer to words that cannot be sounded out using letter-sound
correspondences and may need to be taught as exceptions.


In this program, we define these terms as follows:


   - A Tricky Word is a word that does not play by the rules. It is a word containing at least one part that
cannot be read correctly via blending or cannot be spelled correctly using the code knowledge
taught so far.


  - A sight word is a high-frequency word that we want students to see many, many times and learn to
read quickly and eventually learn to recognize rapidly.


Teacher Resources **243**


The main difference here is that a Tricky Word always contains some irregular element, whereas a
sight word might or might not. The Venn diagram below shows the relationship between these two
categories, as understood within this program.

|Tricky Words|Overlap|Sight Words|
|---|---|---|
|colonel, aisle, Aarol, ballet|of, to, once, one, was, who, said|in, it, at, on, if, then, this, did, and, with|



The words in the left circle are Tricky Words: each one contains at least one set of letters that is not
pronounced the way you would expect. Or, if you prefer to look at matters from a spelling point of
view, you could say each contains at least one sound that is not written as you would expect it to
be.


The words in the right circle are sight words: they are all high-frequency words that students
should see frequently and eventually learn to recognize rapidly.


The shaded area in the middle shows that there is considerable overlap between the two categories
(which is probably why the two senses of _sight word_ are regularly confused). Some words qualify
as sight words because they are used a lot and as Tricky Words because they are not pronounced
(or written) as you would expect. These are irregular words (and therefore hard to read and write,
at least first) and very common (and important for student success). They are candidates for
special instruction, and many of them are given special instruction in this program.


The area on the far left shows words that are tricky in the sense that they depart from the most
common spelling patterns. But these words do not qualify as sight words on most lists because
they are not especially common. Words of this sort are sprinkled throughout the language but do
not receive much attention because they are only used occasionally. Students can learn them as
the need arises in upper grades.


The area on the far right shows words that qualify as sight words because they are very common
and should be rapidly recognized but do not qualify as Tricky Words because they are completely
regular. All of them are pronounced and spelled exactly as you would expect. They can be sounded
out and set down on paper using basic letter-sound correspondences taught in Kindergarten.
Students need to see these words—and they will see most of them frequently in the materials—but
you probably do not need to give these words special attention, and you certainly should not ask
students to memorize them as wholes. Students can simply read them by sounding them out. After
sounding them out several times, they will begin to recognize them more rapidly. In other words, no
special teaching is required for these regular high-frequency words. All that is required is multiple
exposures, and students are likely to get multiple exposures since the words are so common.


~~**SIGHT WORDS**~~


The guidelines for teaching Tricky Words are outlined in the previous section. As already noted, we
use the term _sight word_ in this program to refer to high-frequency words that we want students to
see many, many times and learn to recognize rapidly.


**244** Foundational Skills 6


The program does place the initial emphasis on reading regular words. But that does not mean
high-frequency sight words are not being learned. In fact, as noted above, many sight words are
completely regular and become decodable as students learn letter-sound correspondences. This
means that the program is a very effective program for teaching sight words.


To illustrate this, consider one of the most widely used lists of sight words, Dr. Edward Fry’s
“Instant Word” list. Fry’s list is divided into groups of 100. For illustration purposes, we will focus
on the first three lists of 100 words, 300 words in all. These are words that Fry recommends be
mastered in the first several grades of school. We found more than half of the Fry Instant Words
become fully decodable in kindergarten, meaning they are either regular and can be sounded out
using the letter-sound correspondences taught, or they are Tricky Words explicitly taught in the
program.


**HIGH-FREQUENCY WORDS**


In addition to addressing Tricky Words and tricky spellings, this program emphasizes the reading
and spelling of high-frequency words carefully selected from word lists compiled by researchers
Edward William Dolch and Edward Fry. These lists are instrumental in aiding students, particularly
young learners, to become more proficient readers by focusing on words that frequently appear in
English reading materials.


Specifically for Grade 3 students, the lists include 132 words, of which this program provides
explicit instruction for 98. These words are selected based on their prevalence across various unit
Readers, ensuring instruction is both relevant and practical. Instruction is integrated into lessons
at points where students will naturally encounter these words within the assigned sections of the
Readers.


The program encourages students to identify and recall previously taught high-frequency words
to reinforce learning, thereby gradually expanding their lexicon through repeated exposure. This
strategic approach ensures that students learn to recognize and use these essential words and
improve their reading fluency and comprehension.


The process for determining which high-frequency words to teach and the timing of their
introduction is structured and integral to the curriculum, designed to optimize comprehension and
retention. Each unit focuses on 8–12 high-frequency words. These words are carefully selected
based on their relevance as content words central to the unit’s Reader and their frequent usage
throughout the Reader. To facilitate learning, these words are introduced by sounding them out and
employing Spelling Cards, which aid in decoding.


As the unit progresses, the high-frequency words highlighted in the Reading section of each
lesson are consistently reviewed, ensuring recognition and understanding of these words both in
and out of context. To reinforce learning and maintain engagement, focused high-frequency word
decode/encode games found in the Reading section are incorporated every few days, strategically
reviewing one-third of the previously encountered words to reinforce retention.


Teacher Resources **245**


To further consolidate learning, a final high-frequency word game that reviews all the words
introduced in the unit is played at designated Pausing Points, ensuring multiple opportunities
to interact with and master these words. Additionally, fluency checkpoints are conducted to
monitor progress in automaticity and fluency, essential components of reading proficiency. This
comprehensive approach ensures that students are not only exposed to high-frequency words but
also engage with them in a variety of contexts, enhancing reading skills and confidence.

|Unit|High-Frequency Word Scope and Sequence|

|1|night, about, tree, story, thought, every, began, hard, important, river, small, near|
|2|talk, walk, head, eyes, book, being, run, drink, long, much, keep, group|

|10|eight, school, enough, show, watch, song, almost, list|



~~**CUSTOMIZING AND ADAPTING THE PROGRAM**~~


This is a highly structured and sequenced program. We are unapologetic about that, as we believe
the structure and sequence will be very helpful to students as they work to learn the English
spelling code. However, this is not a scripted program in which teachers are required to read
the manual and give one of a handful of approved responses. We expect—indeed, we hope—
teachers will tweak the phrasing and come up with ways to customize, personalize, and adapt the
instruction.


Our goal has been to put things in a logical order and provide all the guidance and support
necessary for a new teacher, or a teacher new to this kind of phonics instruction.


At the same time, we believe there is room for experienced and creative teachers to customize
and adapt the program. Indeed, some of the exercises included in this version of the program were
developed by teachers in our pilot programs!


Sometimes in the lessons, we give exact phrasing that we suggest you use; more often, however,
we give indirect phrasing and/or encourage you to explain something using your own words. You
should feel free to make changes to the phrasing. For example, you may prefer to speak of “a
picture of a sound” or a “spelling.” Later in the year, you may want to teach the term _digraph_, or
you may prefer to refer to the letters in a digraph as a “letter team” or as “buddy letters.” There are
many ways to customize the program and the language while preserving the basic instructional
principles and sequence of instruction.


For the presentation of words, you may write on a chalkboard, a whiteboard, chart paper, an


**246** Foundational Skills 6


overhead projector, a document camera, or the projection system of your choice. A projection
system works especially well for activity pages since it allows the teacher to model the task exactly
as the students will be completing it. You may use a pocket chart, a magnetic board with magnetic
letters, an overhead projector with letters cut from a transparency, or a smart board. Many
modifications of this sort can be made without adversely impacting the quality of the instruction.


You should also always feel free to add additional activities and activity pages that are consistent
with our philosophy of instruction. You should always feel free to respond to the teachable
moment, even if it leads you slightly off the path laid out in the Teacher Guide.


There are only a handful of things you should not do:


You should not skip a lesson in which new code knowledge is taught. If you do, students will lack
important code knowledge, untaught spellings will begin to appear in their word lists and on their
activity pages, and the lessons will start to make less sense to them.


For the same reasons, you should not reorder the lessons. The program relies heavily on
sequencing, and instruction will be confused and less effective if the lessons are reordered.


~~**SMALL-GROUP WORK**~~


Large parts of this program have been written for whole-group instruction, but the program can
be customized to allow for small-group instruction of various kinds. You will note that there are
Support and Challenge sidebars sprinkled throughout the lessons that will guide you in how to
differentiate instruction for your students, while still using the whole-class approach described in
the lessons.


Since some students will learn the new information right away while others will need more practice,
you may wish to do small-group work to follow up the initial introduction of code knowledge.
You will note that many lessons do include suggestions for small groups; you should feel free to
adapt to these and other lessons as they best meet the needs of your students. We have seen this
program taught very effectively in small groups and in workstations students visit on rotation.


~~**ADJUSTING THE SPEED OF INSTRUCTION**~~


This sequence will work for most children. However, all children are different, and all classrooms
are different. Some classrooms may need more time to master concepts than others. The program
has been designed so the pace of instruction can be adjusted as needed.


The most important thing for you to know is that you can pause at any point in the program.
If students are not learning the material, simply stop where you are and do additional work to
remediate or reteach as needed. All lessons contain some materials you can use if you pause.


In addition, at the end of each unit, there is a “Pausing Point.” If the end-of-unit assessment or your


Teacher Resources **247**


observations suggest some members of the class need additional time to master the concepts
taught in the unit, this is an especially good place to stop and provide additional practice and
review. The Teacher Guides include additional work at each Pausing Point. They will typically
provide enough for at least one or two days of additional work. The materials provided in the
Pausing Point can be used in various ways. Sometimes you may wish to have all students do the
same activity or activity page. At other times you may wish to work individually or in small groups
with students who are struggling with a particular concept.


To slow down instruction, you can pause either in the middle of a unit or at a Pausing Point. We do
not recommend that you attempt to speed up the sequence of instruction. The program lays out an
ambitious program of instruction.


The Grade 3 program of instruction should work well for a wide range of students. You should begin
with the assumption that the Grade 3 program is an appropriate option for all students in the class.


Inevitably, however, there will be differences in learning. Students learn at different rates. Some
students will pick up the material quickly; others will have more difficulty. There are many
strategies for dealing with this. In general, we encourage you to try to keep most of the class
together if it makes sense. It is much easier to teach one set of students at roughly the same level
than it is to teach two or three groups at very different levels.


If you find some students are lagging, you may still be able to keep the class together for the main
lessons but find extra time two to four times a week to work with those students who seem to need
extra practice.


If this is not sufficient, you may eventually need to regroup some students. As we note in Lessons 4
and 5 of this unit, it is especially important to administer the placement assessment to all students
at the start of the year. We strongly recommend that teachers then use an “across grade” approach
to grouping students. If there are two classrooms, these two teachers should look at all of the
Grade 3 students in both classrooms and consider regrouping students for Skills instruction only,
with one teacher taking the class of students who need review and more practice, while the other
teacher works with those students ready to move on to Grade 3 Skills instruction. It will likely be
worthwhile to reconvene at multiple times during the year to plan across the grade level, using
the end-of-unit assessments. In this way, students in need of remediation can be moved to the
appropriate group, while students who are making progress can advance.

**Appendix C:**
#### Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words


Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught will enable students to read one
syllable word with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences is no
guarantee that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllabic words. To this
end, most students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk and read
parts of words—syllables—to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can
then be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated, and students are
expected to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, the program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the
easiest two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is
already a familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In
addition, each syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic
familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing_, _hunt·er_, _bust·ed_ ).
The dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain doubleletter spellings for consonants, in this program, the divider is typically placed after the doubleletter spelling rather than between the two consonants (e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers
that are familiar with other ways to chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is
done, however, because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single-spelling units
since kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.). The program strives to be consistent in
representing these spellings in the way that the students have been taught to process them (e.g.,
as whole entities for a sound). (Ultimately, as students become more proficient at decoding and
chunking syllables through subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually
chunk and decode these words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding
these two-syllable words consisting of root words and suffixes relatively easy.


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable
words.


Teacher Resources **255**


To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


  - **Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound (e.g.,**
**/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/):** _let, pad, rod, tin, fun, pic·nic, un·til_


  - **Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/,**
**/ie/, /oe/, /ue/):** _cake, home, like, mule, Pete, mis·take, stam·pede_


  - **Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint, speak, proud, play, dis·may, be·low, coun·sel_


  - **R-Controlled Syllables:** _art, curb, girl, fort, clerk, tur·nip, ar·tist, fe·ver_


  - **Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /ie/,**
**/oe/, /ue/):** _go, me, hi, a·pron, fi·nal, com·pre·hend_


  - **Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple, puz·zle, raf·fle, ca·ble, ri·fle_


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


  - _Schwa Syllables:_ ben·e·fit, ap·pe·tite, a·bout, hos·pit·al, e·mo·tion


**Note:** The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately
because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


To decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these names. The names of the
syllable types are provided here only to establish a common vocabulary for teachers as they use
the materials. What is necessary, however, for students to become fluent readers of longer words in
increasingly complex text is that they be able to visually parse certain spelling patterns as syllable
chunks so they can quickly and easily decode each syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


  - When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.
_ad·mit_ _nap·kin_ _trum·pet_


  - For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed
after the double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is
because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units since kindergarten
(‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).
_traff·ic_ _muff·in_ _happ·en_


**256** Foundational Skills 6


  - When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.
_mon·ster_ _con·tract_ _pil·grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read
the first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model
for students how to blend the two syllables aloud:


  - In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the magic
‘E’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


  - Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for closed
syllables:
_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


  - In Grades 2 and 3, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to
use a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying
each possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


  - When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:
_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_


Teacher Resources **257**


However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There
is no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be
flexible and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to
determine whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. To recognize
whether a word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has
heard before (i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent
an additional challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a
second language.


  - If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:

_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is straightforward.


  - When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings
in the words.
_ban · gle twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_


In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings
represent the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a
combination of stressed and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed
or weakly stressed, its vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that
linguists call a schwa. This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include


**258** Foundational Skills 6


‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’, and ‘tion’. Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite
challenging for many students.


  - Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the
schwa sound has a particular spelling:
_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is a schwa syllable, but it is identified separately
because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables
accordingly throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _tri·cycle_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness_ _help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten—Grade
3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.
