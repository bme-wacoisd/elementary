**Unit 1 | Lesson 1**
#### **Summary of “The Riverbank, Part I”**





_The Wind in the Willows_ follows the adventures of many

animals who live in the English countryside. The animals in

the story act like people.


The chapter “The Riverbank” begins with Mole doing his

spring cleaning. He has swept and dusted. But when he is

mixing some paint, he smells a hint of the fresh spring air

outside. He drops his brush and runs up the tunnel. The world

outside his den is all warm grass and yellow sunlight.


He happily jumps and skips across the grass until he comes

to a hedge. He walks until he comes to a river that is full to the

brim with rushing water. He sits down to rest as he watches

and listens to the river. Soon, a water rat comes out of a hole

on the riverbank. Rat says hello to Mole and asks if Mole

would like to go for a boat ride. Mole has never been in a boat

before and can’t wait to hop in.


Mole has such a good time that Rat invites him to stay on the

boat all day. He packs a picnic basket, and they float down

the river. Mole relaxes and drags a paw in the cool water as

they go. After a while, Mole asks Rat about the places they are

passing by. Rat tells him about the Wild Wood, where many

other creatures live but where they must always be careful.

Mole asks what is past the Wild Wood. Rat doesn’t seem to

want to talk about it. He tells Mole that no one with any sense

goes into the Wide World! Then they stop in a backwater to

have their lunch.





Unit 1 **3**


**Unit 1 | Lesson 3**
#### **Summary of “The Open Road”**





“The Open Road” begins with Mole and Rat on the riverbank.

Mole says that he would like to meet Mr. Toad. Rat agrees to

take Mole for a visit. They row a boat up the river.


Mr. Toad’s house is old and quite nice. Rat says that Mr. Toad

is rich. To their surprise, Mr. Toad is waiting for Rat on the

porch. He hopes Rat will help him with something. He shows

them a brand-new covered wagon painted bright yellow and

green. The inside is complete with bunks for sleeping, a tiny

living space, and a kitchen.


Toad announces that everything is ready for them to leave

that very afternoon. Mole is excited, but Rat is not so sure.

Toad talks to them over lunch. Rat agrees to take the trip. He

is full of praise for “the open road.” They harness Toad’s gray

horse and set off through the countryside.


They sleep in the bunks. In the morning, Mr. Toad sleeps late.

Rat and Mole must do all the work of finding and making

breakfast. On the second morning, they make Mr. Toad join in

doing the chores. He complains.


Later that day, they plod along the narrow lane, and disaster

strikes. From behind comes the strange noise “pup-pup!”

and a white cloud of dust. A motorcar races up the lane. It

passes them so quickly that the caravan goes off the road and

crashes. Rat and Mole try to restore it so they can drive home,

but Mr. Toad does not help. He no longer cares. He has seen

what he wants: a motorcar.





Unit 1 **4**


**Unit 1 | Lesson 5**
#### **Summary of “Mr. Badger”**





The setting for “Mr. Badger” begins in the middle of a cold,

snowy night. Rat and Mole have lost their way and are waiting

outside Badger’s house. Mole is hurt, with a cut on his shin.


When Badger opens his door, they tumble inside. The

house is a set of underground tunnels, and Badger is a very

capable host. With a candle, he leads them to his kitchen. It

is warm and cozy. They hear the crackle of a fire and see a

comfortable place to settle. Badger gives them food and helps

Mole tend to his shin. Later, he offers them two little beds to

sleep in.


In the morning, the weather is worse. In Badger’s kitchen,

they find a couple of young hedgehogs who have lost their

way. They all sit at the table for breakfast. Badger has already

eaten and has settled into his armchair for a nap. Later, Otter

rings the doorbell and asks for Rat and Mole. They have been

gone a long time, and their friends are worried about them.


Badger gives them a tour of his home. It is not simple at all!

Instead, it is a huge tangle of tunnels and rooms. He explains

that it was built by people who left long ago. As the daylight

begins to dwindle, they shuffle along the passages to a

shortcut home, with a jumble of vines and plants hiding

the door.





Unit 1 **5**


**Unit 1 | Lesson 11**
#### **Summary of “The Further Adventures** **of Toad, Part II”**





“The Further Adventures of Toad, Part II” begins with Toad in

disguise, riding a horse he stole. He is tired and hungry, and

he has no money. Soon, he meets a traveler with a covered

wagon cooking stew over a fire. The traveler offers to buy the

horse. Toad bargains for a higher price that includes a very

good breakfast.


Toad starts to walk with some cents in his pocket and a big

meal in his belly. He shows his pride by singing a song about

how clever he is. Then a fancy motorcar comes along. Toad

decides to ask for a ride but then remembers the car. It is the

one he stole! He is sure he will be caught, and he plunges to

the ground.


Luckily, the drivers do not know it is Toad because he is still in

disguise. They gently lift him into the car. Soon, Toad regains

his energy. He convinces them to let him drive. Thinking

himself quite the genius, he jumps behind the wheel. He

begins by driving carefully. Then he goes faster and faster. He

reveals that he is Toad. They try to grab him, but he crashes

the car, and everyone goes flying.


Angry with himself, Toad runs away. Then he sees that the

gentlemen from the car are chasing him. With them are two

policemen. It looks like he can’t get away. All of a sudden, he is

splashing and gasping. He has fallen into the river!



Unit 1 **6**


**Unit 1 | Lesson 12**
#### **Summary of “The Return of Toad,** **Part I”**





When “The Return of Toad, Part I” begins, Toad is soaking

wet and on the run. He thinks the gentlemen chasing him will

whisk him away. Then he sees a familiar face in a hole in the

riverbank. Rat quickly pulls him inside the hole.


Rat tells Toad to change out of his stolen clothes while

Rat makes lunch. After washing up, Toad tells Rat about

everything he has done. He quietly admits that he was wrong

to steal the motorcar. Toad wants to go home. He doesn’t

yet know that he can’t return. Over lunch, Rat tells Toad that

some of the animals from the Wild Wood have wrongfully

taken over Toad Hall.


Outraged, Toad storms off to his home. He marches up to the

gate. There, he quarrels with a ferret. Feeling upset, Toad runs

back to Rat’s house. But he isn’t ready to give up. He makes

a request to borrow Rat’s boat and goes quietly up the river.

Two stoats drop a huge stone from a bridge onto the boat. The

boat sinks.


Toad returns to Rat, who is upset at the loss of his boat.

Toad says he will quit making decisions without his friends’

approval. Rat suggests that they wait for Mole and Badger,

who might know what to do to get the house back. Soon,

Badger knocks at the door.



Unit 1 **7**


**Unit 1 | Lesson 13**
#### **Summary of “The Return of Toad,** **Part II”**





In “The Return of Toad, Part II,” Rat ushers in Mole to join Toad

and Badger. The friends chat about what they should do to

reclaim Toad Hall. Toad cannot stop showing off. He has not

learned his lesson about bragging.


Badger hushes everyone and tells Toad that he should be

ashamed. Toad sobs into the sofa cushions. He aches for

home and feels hopeless. But Badger tells them about a

secret passage into Toad Hall. Together, they make a plan.


The next night, the weasels are having a birthday party in

Toad Hall. The four friends creep in along the secret passage.

Soon, they are below the party. They hear cheering, speeches,

and chatter. They push open the trap door and surprise the

weasels. They march into the room. They swing and thump

sticks. It seems like there are more than four of them. The

four heroes are like fighting machines! The weasels screech

and rush away, turning over tables and chairs. Toad can

reclaim his ownership of Toad Hall in triumph.


Toad thinks he should be praised for the victory. But his

friends remind him of the problems his bragging has caused

before. He thinks about it and takes on a new philosophy.

He tries to change. As time goes on, Toad becomes more

thoughtful.



Unit 1 **8**


**Unit 1 | Lesson 14**
#### **Summary of “The Open Road, Part II”**





At the beginning of “The Open Road, Part II,” Toad orders Rat

and Mole to help him. He informs them that it is important.

Rat, who knows Toad very well, is not sure he wants to be of

service.


It turns out that Toad has purchased a wagon with a motor

for traveling and camping. It carries beds, food, water, books,

and even a bird in a birdcage. Toad wants to start their journey

today. As a matter of fact, he wants to depart this very

afternoon.


Toad doesn’t care that Rat has other plans. He doesn’t care

that Rat would prefer to go boating on the river.


Rat firmly says no. However, Toad paints a charming picture.

As he dances and whirls about them with excitement, he tells

of the splendor of the road. He says their life in the open air

will be carefree and thrilling. Mole is quite eager to experience

it. He has never had such an adventure.


Rat starts to waver. He is no longer so sure. He begins to think

that a journey could be fun after all.





Unit 1 **9**


### **Grade 3 | Unit 2**

Lessons 1 and 6: “Rattenborough and Frieda”


Lesson 11: “All About Woodpeckers”


**Unit 2 | Lessons 1 and 6**
#### **Rattenborough and Frieda**





Rattenborough here! I was waving at you, but I wasn’t sure you

saw me.


That reminded me of the time I met my friend Frieda in the

woods. I was hiking, and it was just after sunset. I had a

flashlight so that I could see where I was going. Between the

trees, I thought I saw another flashlight bobbing up and down.

But then it blinked off. I thought someone must have tripped

while they were hiking. I rushed over to help. I looked all around

in the dark, but nobody was there.


Then a small light flashed right next to me. I guess you could

say I was shocked. I jumped and almost dropped my flashlight.

But then a little voice yelped, “Watch where you’re going!” That’s

when I saw where the light was coming from.


Have you guessed? It was Frieda. She’s a firefly. Fireflies talk to

each other with light. Chemicals mix in their bodies, creating light.


Despite the name, fireflies are really part of the beetle family.

They have strong, shell-like wings. They like living in warm, humid

woods and fields, and they love drifting near lakes and ponds.


I don’t know about you, but I think being able to light up would

be pretty useful. For one thing, you wouldn’t have to carry a

flashlight. For another thing, firefly lights are more efficient than

any light bulb humans have ever invented.


Frieda says that some fireflies are endangered. Humans are

moving into the places where fireflies once lived. But people

can help by planting bug-friendly gardens. People can also start

letting autumn leaves rot on the ground instead of bagging them

up as well as turning off outdoor lights that could be confusing

for insects like Frieda.



Unit 2 **11**


**Unit 2 | Lesson 11**
#### **All About Woodpeckers**





_Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat!_ What is that?


Maybe you’ve heard something that sounds like quick hammering

in the trees. It might be a woodpecker. Different kinds of

woodpeckers live in the forests of almost every continent.


A woodpecker’s hammering noise comes from its beak. The

beak is long and sturdy, like a sharp tool. And like a sharp

tool, the woodpecker uses its beak to dig into the wood. The

woodpecker bangs its beak into tree trunks. It also pulls and

pries dry bark off the trunk.


Why would woodpeckers spend so much time shredding

branches? Do they hate trees? Nope! They’re hungry.

Woodpeckers eat insects like flies and beetles, as well as spiders

and millipedes. Many of these creepy-crawlies live in trees or lay

eggs in the wood.


Woodpeckers also eat nuts, grains, and seeds. The acorn

woodpecker drills holes into the sides of trees and stores acorns

in these holes.


A woodpecker’s noise carries far and wide. It helps other

woodpeckers know where to find it. The sound also helps

woodpeckers define their territories, or the areas where they live.


So, why don’t woodpeckers hurt themselves? If we hit our heads

against the trees, we could get badly hurt, but woodpeckers are

fine. For one thing, their brains are much smaller and lighter

than ours. We also know that some of the bones in their necks

are like sponges. They have open cavities, or pockets of air, that

might offer padding. Lastly, when woodpeckers are pecking,

most of the force is spread out towards their body and very little

to the bird’s brain. Woodpeckers remind us of the beauty of

nature and the world around us.





Unit 2 **12**


### **Grade 3 | Unit 3**

Lessons 1 and 6: “How Do Your Skeleton and Your Joints Help You Walk?”


Lesson 11: “All About the Bones in Your Ears”


**Unit 3 | Lessons 1 and 6**
#### **How Do Your Skeleton and Your Joints** **Help You Walk?**





You probably do something difficult every day without even

thinking about it. You walk!


People are the only mammals that usually walk on two feet.

Adults and children all walk on two feet. Other mammals, like

wolves, sheep, and deer, walk on four. Some mammals, like

bears, can balance on two feet. They might even walk a few

steps, but that isn’t the main way they get around.


Can you think of any other animals that _always_ walk on two

feet? Here’s a hint: _Honk!_ That’s right—geese. In fact, all birds



walk (or hop, or waddle) on two feet.


Babies don’t walk. They crawl until the first or second year of their lives. They have to learn to

walk. It takes a lot of practice. It also takes a lot of falling down. The muscles in their legs and feet

have to get stronger.


Wiggle your toes. Spread them out wide. Point and flex your foot. Rotate it in a circle. Your feet

and ankles can move in many different ways. The calf—the big muscle below your knee on the

back of the leg—helps your feet move. If you touch your calves, you can feel them working as you

move your feet and toes.


Why do you think your feet and toes need to move in so many different ways? One reason is

that you move in many ways. You walk, run, jump, and dance. You go forward and backward and

sideways. That takes balance. It takes flexibility. The bones in your feet form three different

arches. These help your feet respond to changes in the ground you walk on. The joints in each of

your legs—ankle, knee, and hip—also help. If you step on a small pebble, you don’t fall over.


Walking takes strength too. Your legs are heavy. When you walk or run, your feet take a beating

from the weight. Did you know your feet were that strong?


Unit 3 **14**


**Unit 3 | Lesson 11**
#### **All About the Bones in Your Ears**





You can see and feel the shapes of some of your bones. If you

watch your fingers moving, you can see where the different

bones begin and end. By putting your hand on your knee, you

might be able to feel your patella, or kneecap, as you bend

and straighten your leg to raise your foot.


But you have other bones that are covered. You can’t see

them or touch them. Three of these bones are inside each

of your ears. They’re the smallest bones in the human body.

These bones help people hear.



The hammer bone is next to your eardrum. The eardrum vibrates, or moves back and forth

quickly when a sound enters the ear. When that shaking reaches the hammer, the hammer shakes

too. It shakes in a way that increases the vibrations.


Next to the hammer is the anvil bone. An anvil is a hard metal surface that a blacksmith strikes.

A blacksmith is a person who melts iron and uses tools to make metal objects like horseshoes.

The bones look a little bit like a hammer and anvil. When the hammer vibrates, the anvil starts to

vibrate too. Although it is smaller than the hammer, the anvil amplifies the vibrations even more.


The vibrations reach the tiniest bone of all, the stirrup. It is shaped like the stirrup on a saddle. At

its end is a membrane, which connects to the inner ear. The stirrup carries the vibrations to the

fluid in the inner ear. Waves in this fluid reach the hairlike cells in the cochlea. (Remember, the

cochlea is the bony, snail-shaped tube in the inner ear.) The cells translate the waves into nerve

signals. When the signals reach your brain, you hear the sound!


That’s a complicated process. But it happens very fast, without you ever having to think about it.


Unit 3 **15**


### **Grade 3 | Unit 4**

Lesson 1: “The Founding of Rome”


Lesson 6: “What Did Ancient Romans Eat?”


Lesson 11: “All About the Pantheon”


**Unit 4 | Lesson 1**
#### **The Founding of Rome**





How did the city of Rome get its start? One story is that Rome

was founded, or started, by the twins Romulus and Remus.


According to the myth, Princess Rhea Silvia gave birth to twin boys

named Romulus and Remus. Their father was the Roman god of

war, Mars. You might also know him by his Greek name, Ares.


Rhea was the daughter of Numitor, the king of Alba Longa.

Numitor had been forced from his throne by his brother

Amulius. Amulius was afraid that the twins would grow up and

take control of the kingdom. The boys were put in a basket and

sent down the Tiber River. Miraculously, they survived!


The river’s waters carried them to a fig tree growing on the

riverbank. There, a she-wolf and a woodpecker fed the boys.

The twins were rescued by a shepherd, who raised them.


When they grew up, Romulus and Remus returned to Alba

Longa. They helped their grandfather Numitor become king

again. Later, they built the city of Rome at the place where

they had been rescued from the river. The Tiber River still runs

through Rome today.


Unfortunately, this story doesn’t have the happiest ending. Romulus

wanted more power. He built a city wall to get rid of Remus. For a

while, Romulus ruled with the leader of a nearby group of people

called the Sabines. Then, he disappeared in a storm. In one version

of the story, he became the immortal Roman god Quirinus.


The story of brother against brother is common in many Greek

and Roman myths. So is the story of the fearful ruler who tries to

protect their power. Over the years, people who retold the stories

of real historical figures may have also added other details. So we

will likely never know the whole true story of how Rome got

its start.





Unit 4 **17**


**Unit 4 | Lesson 5**
#### **What Did Ancient Romans Eat?**





What were daily mealtimes like in ancient Rome? A plebeian

might eat vegetables with cheese and bread. The bread would

have been made from wheat or barley, like today’s multigrain

bread. Protein would usually come from peas, beans, or

seafood. Beef was expensive, so it wasn’t in every dish.


Dishes might be spicy or salty. Romans liked fresh herbs

and pepper. Many people seasoned their food with a fish

sauce called garum. It might have tasted a bit salty. Romans

wrote down some of these recipes. We can still see the

old recipes today.


Wealthy patrician Romans ate differently. Their meals

included poultry and even songbirds. Would you like to taste

peacock or flamingo? The wealthiest patricians did! They also

liked to eat dormice, or tiny rodents. Romans stuffed them

with sausage and spices. For them, this was a delicacy, or

luxurious treat.


Romans liked sweets too, just as we do. The taste of

sweetness often came from honey or fruits, like dates or

grapes. Little cakes or cookies with sesame seeds were both

sweet and nutty.


Some people ate at home. Others bought food at street

vendors or bakeries in the city. Two things they didn’t eat

were pizza and spaghetti. We now think of those as typical

foods that come from Italy, where modern-day Rome is

located. However, tomatoes were first grown by people in

South America and were not brought to Rome or other parts

of Europe until the 1500s. The ancient Romans didn’t eat

them at all.





Unit 4 **18**


**Unit 4 | Lesson 9**
#### **All About the Pantheon**





You might think of concrete as something modern. After all,

it’s in many cities. But it’s actually ancient! Romans made

concrete many centuries—or hundreds of years—ago. Roman

concrete was made from a mix of seawater, lime, and ash

from volcanoes.


Roman concrete can be seen in an ancient temple called the

Pantheon. Its concrete dome is the largest in the world. You

might think all that concrete would be heavy, and you would

be right. The dome weighs nearly 5,000 tons. The concrete

coffers, or building blocks, were carefully placed in rings so

that the blocks pressed against each other to stay in place.


Inside the Pantheon, there is more beauty to behold. The

marble floor and walls are decorated with paintings and small

nooks which hold statues. The domed ceiling used to be

covered in bronze, but now it is bare. In the 1600s, the bronze

was removed and used to make weapons and decorations.


The Pantheon does not have windows. At the top of the dome

is the oculus, a round hole. It lets light into the building. It also

lets in rain, so the floor has a cleverly built drain. During the

day, a circle of light creeps around the inside.


Many of the magnificent buildings of ancient Rome are ruins

now. The Pantheon is not. This is partly because it has been

used since it was built. It became a church. It is also a place

where great artists and saints of the past are buried. People

still get married there today. The Pantheon can feel quite

empty. Even in a crowd, you might feel as though you are

alone with the circle of sky you can see through the oculus.

### **Grade 3 | Unit 5**

Lesson 1: “Summary of ‘What Is Light?, Part I’”


Lesson 6: “All About Refraction”


Lesson 11: “Samuel Explains Energy to Amy and Ethan”


Unit 5 **20**


**Unit 5 | Lesson 1**
#### **Summary of “What Is Light?, Part I”**





Chapter 1 reveals information about a form of energy we

see every day: light. Light moves through the world at great

speed—up to 186,000 miles per second.


Light travels as a wave. The waves have many lengths. The

length of a wave determines whether or not we can see the

light. Wavelengths also affect how we see color. We see the

longest waves as red and the shortest as violet.


Some animals’ eyes are different from ours. They can see light

people can’t see with our eyes alone. Bees, for example, can

see a color called ultraviolet. There are ultraviolet patterns

on flower petals. We need special lenses to view these colors.

However, we can see red easily and bees can’t!


The sun is our main source of energy. That energy comes

to us as heat and light, which are created when the sun’s

hydrogen atoms are converted to helium. The energy travels

through space to Earth. The sun’s light is called white light.

That means it is made up of a combination of all the colors

we can see: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.

The moon can also look as though it gleams with white light.

Actually, it doesn’t create light of its own. It reflects the light

of the sun.


We use electricity to power our own sources of light and heat.

Electricity is a type of energy. Where do you think the energy

for electricity comes from?





Unit 5 **21**


**Unit 5 | Lesson 6**
#### **All About Refraction**





You already know that light rays travel at a very fast speed.

You also know that light rays travel in straight lines. But

what happens when something gets in the way of a ray’s

movement?


Light waves can pass through many things. Some things do

not break the wave, but they change its shape. They bend it,

or change the direction in which it is moving. This is known as

refraction. When light rays bend, they look different to us.


Maybe you have seen the way someone seems to change

shape when they are in a swimming pool. Their legs may look

flat or the parts of the body that are out of the water may look

dainty. That’s because light slows down as it moves from air

to water, and the water bends rays of light.


A convex lens curves out. When light rays pass through a

convex lens, they bend in, toward the center of the lens. This

makes what you see through the lens look magnified, or

greater. Convex lenses help us see tiny details more plainly.

They also help us see things that are far away, like the faintest

stars in the night sky. Our eyes contain convex lenses. We also

use them in cameras, microscopes, and telescopes.


A concave lens curves in, toward its center. It bends the light

rays so they move away from each other. This makes what you

see through the lens look smaller. It can help the lens show a

wider array, or range, of things. When might we need to use

a concave lens? What would someone gain by making things





look



smaller?



Unit 5 **22**


**Unit 5 | Lesson 11**
#### **Samuel Explains Energy to Amy** **and Ethan**





_Tick, tick, tick, tick . . . ding!_


“Finally!” yelled Ethan. “The cake has finished baking!” Samuel

raced to put on an apron and oven mitts. As he took out the

cake, he inhaled the fragrant smell of chocolate that filled

the air.


“How can you still crave cake after everything we just ate?”

asked Amy. The Thanksgiving plates were piled high on

the table. Everyone had eaten turkey, potatoes, kale salad,

stuffing, gravy, and Jack’s famous maple-glazed bacon and





carrots. Jack was snoozing in Samuel’s armchair.


“I can always make space for cake,” said Ethan.


“Same here,” said Samuel. “We’ll just have to be patient while I make the frosting.” The oven made

a vibrating sound and then whirred.


“What was that?” yelped Ethan.


“There’s a fan in the oven,” Samuel explained. “It helps cool down the oven after I turn it off.”


Amy stared through the oven window. “Does baking use energy?” she asked.


“It sure does,” said Samuel. “It takes energy to heat something up. There’s a gas flame in the

oven.”


“There’s a lot of energy in a kitchen, isn’t there?” asked Amy.


“Yes!” agreed Samuel. “You’re probably thinking about things like the oven and the microwave

and the refrigerator. Those all use energy from gas or electricity, and they release light, heat, and

sound waves. But there’s also energy in things like that kale salad. Food stores energy. When we

eat the food, we get the energy to do things like walk, paint, play baseball—”


“Or eat cake,” interrupted Ethan.


“Or eat cake,” Samuel smiled.

**Unit 6 | Lesson 6**
#### **The Ravens’ Journey**





It is a bright morning. Sunshine pours into the window of Odin’s

castle. Odin sits at a long table eating his breakfast. At his side

are his ravens, Thought and Memory. He slices pieces of bread

and feeds his pets. Odin is a wise man. He has taken a drink

from the well of wisdom and knows about the universe, yet he

wants to know more.


Odin whispers to Thought and Memory, “Fly to every kingdom.

Visit the brave in Valhalla. Travel over the rainbow bridge to

Earth. Soar to faraway lands and watch the giants and the

dwarves. Glance in every window and door. Return to me in the

evening and tell me all you have seen and heard.” The birds take

to the sky and promise to return at sunset.


A cold wind is in the air as Thought and Memory take flight

over the kingdoms. They see Thor and his wife Sif traveling

through the roads of Asgard outside Odin’s great castle. They

see the dwarves hard at work making valuable treasures. In the

kingdom of giants, the ground rumbles as they lumber around.

Thought and Memory soar across the Rainbow Bridge to

watch the Vikings on Earth. The birds crisscross the kingdoms

fascinated by what they see and excited to share their news

with Odin.


The sun starts to set. Odin gives a whistle from his window but

there is no response. Odin puts his hand to his ear and listens

carefully. He is scared his birds are lost. Then, there is a soft

flap of wings and response in the wind. He hears a scratchy

“Caw! Caw!” Thought and Memory land on Odin’s shoulders.

They whisper about their journey in his ears. They tell him

stories of kindness and scoundrels, princesses and farmers,

and all they have seen. Odin, pleased with the report from his

loyal ravens, congratulates Thought and Memory on a job

well done.

Lesson 1: “Seasons and Equinoxes”


Lesson 6: “Who Was Annie Jump Cannon?”


Lesson 11: “All About Gravity”


**Unit 6 | Lesson 1**
#### **Seasons and the Equinoxes**





Today is my favorite day of the year: September 22. It’s not

just because the trees are starting to turn gold and orange

and red—though they are. It’s not just because right now you

can get the best-tasting apples of the whole year—though

you can. It’s not just because the edge of Lake Michigan is a

beautiful, shining blue—though it is.


No, today is my favorite because it’s one of the two days each

year when day and night are exactly the same length. There





are only two times of the year like this. One is on or around March 20. The other is on or around

September 22. After today, nights here will be longer, because the Northern Hemisphere will be

tilting away from the sun. These days are called equinoxes.


My aunt showed me pictures of a place in England called Stonehenge. It’s a big circle of giant

wedges of rock. Some ancient people arranged the rocks. My aunt said we don’t know much

about those people, but they must have been observing the skies and the seasons. At the summer

solstice—the longest day of the year, in June—the sun appears to set exactly in line with a gap in

the rocks. It’s pretty amazing that people who lived so long ago had the knowledge to figure out

these patterns.


We live in Chicago, which is in the Northern Hemisphere. Today, my aunt and I are going

downtown. During the fall equinox, the sun appears to set exactly in line with a gap between the

skyscrapers. It floods the streets with orange light edging across the landscape. People call this

“Chicagohenge.” I can’t wait to see it for myself.


What I find most amazing about the equinox is that people have been observing it for so long. It’s

as though, throughout the ages, people have understood how special this planet is. They must

have understood how the sun gives us just the right amount of heat—along with gorgeous orange

light. They must have understood how the trees lose their leaves and then regrow them (and then

grow apples!). And they must have understood how all of these patterns of change let us change

and grow along with them. Is it any wonder that this is my favorite day?


Unit 6 **26**


**Unit 6 | Lesson 6**
#### **Who Was Annie Jump Cannon?**





Humans have been studying the sky for centuries. Bit by

bit, scientists have gained knowledge and helped us better

understand the stars and the universe.


One such scientist was Annie Jump Cannon. Cannon was a

computer. Back in the 1890s, the word _computer_ didn’t mean

what it means today. It referred to a person who did repetitive

mathematical work. Many of the first computers were women.


Cannon worked with a number of other women in a laboratory

at Harvard University. Astronomer Edward Pickering ran the

lab. He had announced a goal of listing all the stars seen in

the sky. That work would have once involved telescopes.

Innovations in photography meant that the lab had images of

the stars. The computers scanned photographs of the night

sky. They counted and classified each point of light.


Two computers, Williamina Fleming and Antonia Maury, had

created a system. When Cannon joined the work, she changed

certain things in their system. She had a knack for identifying

the different forms of light that the stars seemed to give off.

She designed a system to assign the stars to different groups.

Other scientists soon recognized that Cannon was actually

organizing stars by their temperatures. Her system became

the standard way to classify stars.


New technology helps scientists find stars and galaxies that

hadn’t been visible before. But scientists still use Annie Jump

Cannon’s system to classify the stars they find.





Unit 6 **27**


**Unit 6 | Lesson 11**
#### **All About Gravity**





Gravity is a force of attraction. Gravity pulls matter—all

matter—together. You can’t see it, but you can see and feel

what it does. If you’ve ever been to the shore of a large body

of water and been captivated by the rise and fall of the water

level with the tide, you’ve seen gravitational pull in action.


Objects with great mass—that is, a great amount of matter—

have a strong gravitational pull. Earth and the sun have strong

gravitational pulls. An object with less mass has a weaker

gravitational pull. The moon has less mass than Earth, and

its pull is weaker. A house has much less mass than the moon

has. You don’t even notice its gravitational pull, but it’s there!


Mass is not the only thing that affects gravity. Distance

does too. The pull is stronger from close objects than from

those that are far away. That’s why, even when you jump, you

quickly return to the surface of Earth instead of flying through

space toward the sun. In another example, when planets

move farther from the sun in their orbits, the force of gravity

becomes weaker between the sun and those planets.


The sun has nearly all of the mass in our solar system. It is far

larger than any of the planets, even the gas giants like Jupiter.

It is larger than moons, comets, and asteroids. So the sun

has the strongest gravitational pull in the system. However, it

is balanced by the speed at which the planets move in their

orbits. Instead of falling in toward the sun, the entire system

keeps moving.

Lesson 1: “Etu and the Mammoth Hunt”


Lesson 6: “Traditions: Old and New”


**Unit 7 | Lesson 1**
#### **Etu and the Mammoth Hunt**







“Etu, the Hunter” begins with young Etu following his brothers

Hakan and Delsin across the snow. Delsin steps carefully in

Hakan’s footprints, and Etu must do the same. It is his first

hunt, and he must learn from his brothers. They all move

silently to avoid scaring any animals.


It is winter again. The land is covered in snow, and a cold wind

is blowing. Tall grasses peek out above the snow. Etu and his

brothers are hunting woolly mammoths, following a herd that

eats these grasses. Etu’s people will eat the mammoth meat

and use the skin and bones for clothes, shelter, and tools.

Each woolly mammoth is huge and will provide enough meat

to last a long time.


The camp area was damaged by a storm several days ago, so

Etu’s mother and sister stayed behind to repair a shelter. It is

a warm tent made of mammoth skins and bones.


In the distance, Etu’s father and uncles are moving through

the snow. They carry spears and spear-throwers. They will

be the ones to corner a woolly mammoth and surround it for

the hunt. They could still face problems, since the mammoth

might panic and run toward them. It might even cause the

whole herd to stampede. This is why they must move with

such silence.


Late in the day, one mammoth falls behind the herd. The

hunters gather around it and trap it in a ditch, or a low-lying

area. The hunt is successful.

#### **Traditions: Old and New**





“I had an excellent day in school,” said Luna, as she hopped

into the car and buckled her seatbelt.


Oliver smiled. Curious to hear more, he casually asked his

little sister, “Why? What did you learn today?”


“At recess, we used our imaginations and made a castle for

animals who live in the jungle. It was fun,” said Luna. “We

worked on our snail survival investigation during Science,

and after that, we read a story about the Ancestral Puebloans

from this area.”


Oliver’s eyes sparkled. “I love learning about the people who

came before us. What was the story about?”


“The title of the story was ‘Alemeda, the Basket Weaver,’”

explained Luna. “It was about an Indigenous, or Native, girl

who lived in the American Southwest. Her people had a

tradition of making baskets. The basket construction skills

were passed down from mother to daughter. Alemeda would

rather hunt, so she hid. But her little brother revealed where

she was, and her mother reminded her that she must do her

work. Alemeda learned that baskets woven by the Ancestral

Puebloans were both traditional and important for survival.”


“Wow,” said Oliver. “That reminds me of a project our

Aunt Mabel was talking about. She works with a national

organization of Native Americans in Arizona. They help teach

others about the Indigenous food systems used by earlier

generations. They preserve local seeds to grow crops that are

originally from the area. They also teach people how to cook

traditional meals using those regional crops. Grandmother

said that Aunt Mabel has been busy planning a Community



Unit 7 **31**


Healing Meal event.”


“What’s a Community Healing Meal?” asked Luna.


“A Community Healing Meal will bring local people together for a meal made with Indigenous

ingredients,” answered Oliver. “The meal will be made to meet the community’s needs and share

ancestral traditions. I hope I can go.”


“What a sensational idea!” exclaimed Luna. “You are bringing your favorite little sister too, right?”


Oliver laughed. “Sure! It can be a new tradition for us.”


“Now, let’s go to the market and pick up some ingredients to make an after-school snack.”

**Unit 8 | Lesson 1**
#### **Sailors Needed!**





“Crew needed! Sailors needed! Gold, silver, and endless

adventure!” _Clang! Clang!_ The mariner continued along the

street, shouting and ringing a large bell. Young boys followed

him, and behind the boys were several dogs and chickens

whose naps had been rudely disturbed. “Crew needed! Sailors

needed! Leaving in two days!”


Jack and Wilfredo stared after the mariner as the hubbub

faded. _Endless adventure_ . . .





Wilfredo tugged at Jack’s sleeve. “Jack! You’re a thousand miles away.”


“I wish,” said Jack. “Have you ever thought of sailing, Wilfredo?”


“No,” said Wilfredo, laughing. “Absolutely not. Why would anyone want to? The crews on half of

those ships wind up needing to be rescued. The other half of them don’t find anything useful.

Everything’s salty and damp. Everyone gets seasick. You’re stuck wearing a stiff, stinking uniform.”


“But you could find gold,” Jack argued. “They say there’s a whole city of gold! Think of it, Wilfredo!

You could find spices like cumin, perfume, or silks in every hue.”


“Bah,” said Wilfredo. “What use is gold? Oh, it’s beautiful, sure. But no one has ever built a city

of it. You know the issue with gold? It’s heavy, and it’s soft—two things you don’t want building

materials to be. Your city of gold is just a rumor.”


The mariner’s bell echoed from a neighboring street. Jack fell into a thoughtful silence, musing.


“Stay here,” said Wilfredo. “Learn to make shoes, like I do. You have to occupy your time somehow.

You might as well be of use to the world.”


“I do have to occupy my time somehow,” said Jack. “And of course shoes are useful. But . . .

Wilfredo, I want to see and explore the world before I decide to stay in one place.”


“Suit yourself, of course,” said Wilfredo, just as a delicious smell of stew reached them from a

nearby window. “For me, this place has amusement enough.”


Two days later, just as the sun rose, Jack stepped onto the deck of the ship. He had never left his

town before. He would never see it the same way again.


Unit 8 **34**


**Unit 8 | Lesson 6**
#### **Coronado Describes Hawikuh to the** **King of Spain**





Perched on his throne, the King of Spain was surrounded by

his advisors. He faced Francisco Vázquez de Coronado, who

had just made a proposal to the king. “It seems terribly risky.”

The king, who did not trust Francisco, raised an eyebrow and

looked at his advisors. He knew they were shrewd and would

tell him what they thought of Francisco’s plan.


Francisco did not want to lose his opportunity to persuade the

king. “Your Majesty, Friar Marcos saw the place. He swore to





witnessing the city of El Dorado. The people there call it Hawikuh.”


“You talk of gold,” said the king as he threw a disapproving glance at the maps strewn across the

advisors’ table. “You talk of riches. You don’t talk of the men who died after claiming to see the

place.”


Francisco coughed. “Some misunderstandings are— _ahem_ —bound to happen when two groups of

people meet each other.”


“Nearly fifty years!” an advisor shouted from behind the king. “For nearly fifty years, Spain has

sent ships, armies, food, and supplies to the New World, always with the promise of gold, gold,

and more gold. What have we gained? Shipwrecks and, as you say, misunderstandings.”


“We have never had a lookout like Friar Marcos,” said Francisco.


“That proves nothing,” hissed the advisor. “You want the crown to set you loose with even more

resources when there’s no proof—” The king held up a jeweled hand, and the advisor stopped

speaking. The throne room filled with an uncomfortable silence.


Francisco coughed again. “I am prepared to— _ahem_ —invest a large amount of my own money in

this expedition.”


The king’s mouth grew into a smile. “Your own money! Ah, then, sir, Spain will give you support.

And we look forward to the report that you have claimed this El Dorado, this Hawikuh, for

New Spain.”

**Unit 8 | Lesson 10**
#### **A Tale of Mutiny on Henry Hudson’s** **Last Voyage**





“Sausage pie,” said Stefan, seeming to see something far off

in the distance. “That’s what I’ll eat first. Steaming hot, full of

egg and cheese . . . a flaky, buttery crust . . .”


“Stop,” moaned Ralph. “It’s too much to think about.”


Stefan laughed. “If you’re hungry, Ralph, there’s plenty more

dried fish. There’s enough of that to go around forever.”


Peter wrinkled his nose. “Don’t I know it! It’s foul stuff. I’ll

never get that smell out of my nose.”





“Fine then,” said Stefan. “What will you eat, Peter, when you’re back in Amsterdam?”


“Fresh figs,” said Peter, looking as though he had just seen the love of his life. “Have you ever

tasted them? They’re like honey turned into fruit. Most figs don’t grow on the land so far north,

but my folks have a tree, in a warm part of the garden, where the walls keep the leaves safe. You

can eat the fruit right off the tree. It’s fantastic.”


Before Stefan could respond, the three of them were flung to the wooden deck. The ship had

crashed hard against a bank of ice. For days they had been sailing slowly and carefully between

the floating chunks. A rough-edged iceberg could easily tear a hole in the side of the ship and

leave them stranded in the frozen lands at the top of the world.


Peter lifted his head. “Is everyone all right?” he asked.


“Fine enough,” said Stefan, pushing himself up and fighting for balance. Half the ship seemed to

be on top of the ice, and the deck was tilted.


“Oof,” muttered Ralph. He had landed face down, and a large piece of dried fish was stuck to his beard.


The door to the cabin fell open, and Captain Hudson staggered out, doing his best to appear

confident while walking across the slippery floor. “Well!” he said. “We’ve found an ice bank,

haven’t we? Best to hop off and push with some oars until the bottom of the ship is back in the

water. Then we can sail northward.”


Unit 8 **36**


For a moment, his phrases hung in the air. Everyone on the deck was silent. Ralph was staring at

Hudson, fuming, flakes of fish slowly falling off of his face.


“Come on now,” said Hudson. “If we stay here, the sheet of floating ice will freeze solid. Over the

side! Hurry up!” He clapped his gloved hands for emphasis.


Ralph spoke then, and his voice was even more frigid than the Arctic air. “ _You_ can go over the

side,” he said. “ _We_ have gone far enough north.”

Lesson 1: “Life on Roanoke Island”


Lesson 6: “A Day in Anna’s Life in Maryland”


Lesson 12: “William Penn’s Dream Comes True”


**Unit 9 | Lesson 1**
#### **Life on Roanoke Island**









The October sun was low behind the trees as I rose from the

rough earth of the garden. I dusted off my skirt and wobbled

a bit as I stooped for my basket. There was not enough in it.

I had planted long rows of herbs and beans, just as I would

have in England, but they had not grown well on this island,

with its raw sea winds. This would be a feeble harvest.


Father joined me as I walked back to the log house. “How are

you, Eleanor?” he asked.


“I am well,” I said. “Just hungry.” I was always hungry. All of







us were. All summer we had caught fish, but now the fish had moved to warmer waters. On the

mainland, when we could reach it, we could gather nuts. But for two weeks now, the waters had

been too rough to allow a crossing.


“At least you have reason to be hungry,” said Father, smiling at the spherical curve of my belly.

“Some of the men here . . . they complain of hunger, but they do scarcely any work.” His voice

sounded bitter. Leading our group had been difficult for him. Some who wished to occupy the new

land could not work together to feed themselves. Since April, he had been speaking of the need to

secure a food supply. Now, as we gathered the poor harvests, starvation seemed to loom over us.


At the door of the house, my husband raised his hand in greeting. “I have a surprise, Eleanor,” he

said. He lifted a large basket. “Beans! Two Powhatan were on the east shore earlier, seeking trade.”

The Powhatan could cross to and from the mainland even when we could not. They used low

boats that cut smoothly through the water.


“What did you trade with them?” I asked.


He looked sheepish. “My coat,” he said. “It’s no matter. We must be able to provide for you and

the baby.”


Father shook his head in disapproval. “If you two fear starvation—you, who work so much—then I

fear for the rest of the group. I will have to sail back to England for more supplies.”


“Perhaps we can trade more,” I began, but my father cut me off.


“We have nothing left to trade,” he said. “We need flour and oats. We need more seeds—perhaps

different seeds—and fruit tree saplings to make orchards. And you need a coat. The winter will

only get colder. Eleanor,” he added suddenly, “you should sail back with me. The baby could be

born in England.”


Unit 9 **41**


“I want to stay here,” I said. “It will be tougher, but we should be together.”


Father sighed. “You’re free to choose, of course.”


All at once I imagined what this place might be like after he had left. I had never seen the beach

without the great sailing ship at anchor. It had always seemed to promise us that we would be

safe. When it was gone, our isolation would feel absolute.


Unit 9 **42**


**Unit 9 | Lesson 6**
#### **A Day in Anna’s Life in Maryland**





“Anna! Mercy on me, haven’t you finished the chores yet?”


“I’ve _almost_ finished,” I said, hoping my voice didn’t betray

how guilty I felt. As I was gathering the eggs from the

henhouse, I saw a beautiful orange and black bird with a white

stripe on its wing. I had never seen that kind of bird before. I

stopped to enjoy it—only for a moment!—as it chittered and

peeped. Then, before I knew it, the sun was higher in the sky,

and Mama was waiting in the doorway, looking annoyed.





“You’ve been avoiding work long enough, young lady. I want you to run down to the shore and find

some clams and oysters.”


“Yes, Mama,” I replied, trying to disguise my joy. I had thought I was going to have to sit quietly

inside and practice my embroidery—needlepoint, to be more specific. I do not like needlepoint.

You make tiny stitch after tiny stitch, your neck hurts, your eyes squinch up, and you poke your

fingers with the needle—all for a disappointing scrap of fabric. I would far rather go oystering on

the shore.


I grabbed my basket and hurried through the streets. The streets really are streets now, full of

people, horses, and carts. A few years ago, they were just stretches of soil and grass. But now this

is becoming what Papa calls “a proper town.” There are stores, workshops, and three different

churches. People have begun to make the voyage here because Maryland allows people to

practice different kinds of Christianity. That seems to be rare, for some reason I can’t understand,

since we all get to make our own choices.


I came over the hill, and all at once the bay spread out before me—teal, turquoise, and royal blue.

I breathed in the clean salty smell of the ocean. I stood poised at the top of the hill, with the wind

blowing in my face. I love the ocean. It’s always changing, always shifting with the wind or the sky,

and yet always the same.


Another orange and black bird darted ahead of me. It perched on a nodding bit of seagrass, as

though to remind me not to become distracted. I sighed and hurried down to the dunes.


Unit 9 **43**


**Unit 9 | Lesson 11**
#### **William Penn’s Dream Comes True**





William read through the letter three times and then set

it down on his desk. Though it described exactly what he

had been promised, he didn’t believe it. Doubt crept in. He

slouched in his chair and read it again. It astounded him

that it was all there: the grant of land in North America,

the boundaries, the charming name “Penn’s Sylvania,” the

royal seal.


For years he had cherished a vision of a town founded in true





equality. It would have wide, serene streets, laid out on a grid, shaded by towering trees. All men

and women would be empowered to speak up. All religious faiths would be allowed. During the

long, lonely months when he was imprisoned in the Tower of London, he had occupied himself

with these dreams and plans. Now, at last, those dreams could become real.


What to do first? There were many people who needed to be told and accounts that needed

to be managed. Perhaps he should write to his friend and counselor, Thomas. Thomas was

another Quaker who shared William’s belief in equality. He would help bring people of different

backgrounds to the new colony. However, when William started to talk about stone foundations

and grids, Thomas tended to smile and lose interest.


There was another person who would be involved—very closely, William hoped. Miss Springett

had waited for about four years. Even at the announcement of his arrest, she had remained true

to him. Now, at last, they could be married.


But William set that letter aside too. The first people he needed to talk to were the ones who

would be most affected—the ones who lived on the land now. Without their agreement, his plans

would sour. William knew what he needed to do. He began to plan his voyage. Soon he would be

bound for America.
