**Grade 3 | Foundational Skills 1**
#### Introduction


~~**WELCOME**~~


**Dear Third Grade Teacher,**


Welcome! This program was carefully researched and crafted to make every student in your classroom a
reader.


Some key aspects of the Grade 3 Skills Program are listed below.


  - This program follows a scope and sequence that is systematic, and distinct from the foundational
skills integrated into the Grade 3 Reading Language Arts Program. It is not required to teach both
programs to Grade 3 students. Please consider the needs of students in your classroom or district.
If additional time on foundational skills and phonics is needed, plan for a total of 150 minutes of
literacy instruction into the daily schedule. This program may also be paired with another high quality
instructional material that covers comprehension, composition, and inquiry strands of the TEKS.


  - This program teaches reading and spelling in tandem, because they are reciprocal processes. English
spelling involves making pictures of sounds; reading involves translating those pictures back into
sounds and blending the sounds to make words.


  - This program includes explicit, systematic phonics instruction in which students are taught target
skills needed to independently decode and encode words.


  - This program explicitly teaches letter-sound correspondences as opposed to leaving students to
figure these out on their own or deduce them by analyzing familiar whole words (as in some forms of
“analytic” phonics).


  - This program focuses consistently on the phoneme, or single sound, and not on larger units.
Students learn to read words that contain onsets, rimes, and consonant clusters, but they learn to
view and process these larger units as combinations of smaller phoneme-level units. Rimes like _-ick_
and initial clusters like _st-_ are not taught as units but as combinations.


  - This program uses a synthetic phonics approach that teaches students to read by blending through
the whole word; it does not teach multiple cueing strategies, use of pictures as a primary resource in
decoding, or part-word guessing.


  - This program begins by teaching the most common or least ambiguous spelling for a sound (the
basic code spelling); later, it teaches spelling alternatives for sounds that can be spelled several
different ways. Thus, the system is kept simple at first, and complexity is added bit by bit as students
gain confidence and automatize their reading and spelling skills.


  - This program includes words, phrases, and stories for students to read and activity pages for them to
complete that allow for focused, distributed practice working with the letter-sound correspondences
they have been taught.


Introduction
**1**


**2**




 - All words students are asked to read as part of the program are decodable, either because they are
composed entirely of letter-sound correspondences students have been taught or because they
are Tricky Words that have been taught. This means students have a chance to begin reading words
and stories that are completely decodable before tackling words and stories that are full of spelling
alternatives.


 - This program does not require students to write words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have been taught. In other words, students are only asked to write words that
can be spelled (at least plausibly if not always correctly) using the code knowledge they have been
taught.


 - This program carefully controls the introduction of Tricky Words and words with ambiguous or rare
spellings, preferring to have students learn to read and write with regular words that can be blended
and spelled by the letter-sound correspondences taught.


 - This program avoids letter names because what is important for reading is not the letter name but
the sound value the letter stands for. To read the word _cat_, it is essential to know /k/ /a/ /t/, not “see
aay tee.”


 - The remainder of this introduction will provide you with an overview of the various materials included
in the Grade 3 Skills Program, general unit and lesson features, and detailed information about this
first unit of Skills instruction and how you will determine whether your students have the prerequisite
skills needed to be successful in the Grade 3 program.


~~**GRADE 3 SKILLS PROGRAM COMPONENTS**~~


Teacher Components


 - Teacher Guide (one per unit)


 - Spelling Card Set


 - Fluency Supplement (in the program’s online materials)


 - Digital Components (in the program’s online materials)


Student Components


 - Individual Code Chart


 - Activity Book (one copy per student per unit)


 - Reader (one copy per student per unit)


Foundational Skills 1


~~**COMPONENT DESCRIPTIONS**~~


**Teacher Components**
**Teacher Guide**


Each Skills Teacher Guide includes daily lessons that provide detailed directions for all Skills
instruction. The Teacher Guide will indicate whether instruction and/or accompanying activities
should be presented as a whole group, small group, or independent practice. Instruction and
exercises should be presented in the order listed in the Lesson at a Glance chart.


**Spelling Cards**


The Spelling Cards in Unit 1 should be used as new sound/spelling correspondences are introduced
and may also be used at any time during the year with individual or groups of students in need
of targeted acceleration and practice. Students who participated in Grade 2 are very familiar
with the introduction and review of letter-sound correspondences using the Spelling Cards. Each
Spelling Card is printed front and back. One side of the card shows the sound. The other side of
the card shows three things: the top of the card shows the spelling; the bottom shows a sample
word containing the spelling; in the middle is something called a power bar. The power bar gives
an indication of how common the spelling is for the sound it represents. A long power bar that
stretches almost across the card means that this is the main spelling for the sound and there are
very few words that have this sound spelled any other way. A very short power bar means that the
spelling is less common and occurs in fewer English words.


Also note that vowel sound spellings will always be written in green on the Spelling Cards because
when saying a vowel sound, the mouth is wide open, letting the air “go”; the one exception to this
are the r-controlled vowel sound spellings which are written in blue. Consonant sound spellings are
written in red.


**Fluency Supplement**


The Fluency Supplement, available in the program’s online materials, was created to accompany
Grade 3 materials and is for use at your discretion. It consists of short poetry, fiction, nonfiction
selections, and Reader’s Theater. These additional text selections provide opportunities for students
to practice reading with fluency and expression (prosody). The selections are grouped by unit;
selection topics relate to the content of the respective unit’s student Reader.


The selections within a given unit can be used in any order, though they are arranged in the
supplement according to word count, starting with the shortest selections. At the beginning of
each week, it is suggested that you choose an online selection and make sufficient copies for
each student. Early in the week, you should take time to model reading the selection aloud to all
students. Then, students should take the selection home to practice reading aloud throughout
the week. The expectation for all students should be that they are prepared to read the selection
fluently and with prosody by Friday. At the end of the week, you should select a few students to
individually read the selection aloud and/or have a few students choral read the selection. Be sure
to provide opportunities for different students to read aloud each week. You may also wish to use
these selections to assess students’ performance in fluency and expression (prosody). A fluency
rubric is included to help track students’ progress toward fluent reading. For more information on
implementation, along with the take-home letter for families, please consult the supplement.

**Digital Components**


The program’s digital components include copies of all sections in the student Reader and the
activity pages for each unit, so these materials may be displayed or projected for all to see. In
addition, whenever a lesson directs a teacher to create charts and/or to write substantive material
on the board, the same materials are also included in the unit’s digital components to facilitate
projection, if you prefer to display them in that way.


**Student Components**
**Individual Code Chart**


Students will use the Individual Code Chart to record the vowel sound/spelling correspondences
and consonant sound/spelling correspondences that they learn. These charts are a good way for
students to have at hand a guide to help them remember what they have learned. You may wish to
encourage students to refer to the Individual Code Chart when reading and spelling independently.
A copy of the Grade 3 Individual Code Chart is included in Teacher Resources at the back of this
Teacher Guide for your reference.


**Activity Book**


The student Activity Book pages are organized by lesson; the Teacher Guide provides directions
within each lesson as to when and how each activity page should be used. Some pages are designed
to be completed as a group with teacher assistance, while other pages are intended to be completed
independently by each student. In addition to practice exercises for reinforcement of skills, the
Activity Book also includes assessment pages, homework, copies of the stories read in class, and
take-home letters for family members. On the program’s digital components site, you will find
a digital version of the Activity Book so it can be displayed or projected for all to see as you give
directions and/or provide scaffolded instruction, modeling how to complete each page.


**Reader**


The Readers for each unit contain 100 percent decodable text for students to read. There is one
Reader for each unit, and all students should have their own copy. The last page of each Reader
identifies new code knowledge introduced in the current unit.


By Grade 3, students have learned most of the code knowledge needed to confidently tackle natural
text in any grade-level-appropriate book. Not every word in the Reader is decodable; however,
students are taught to segment these words using the code knowledge they have learned to read
challenging, unfamiliar words. The Readers are designed for students to grapple with complex text,
including many new content-specific vocabulary words. They learn to use a glossary, as needed, to
better understand the text.


Students will be engaging in repeated readings of the Reader. Repeated readings is a researchbased strategy that enhances student fluency and rate by providing opportunities for students to
practice reading passages multiple times. Through repetition, students develop greater familiarity
with the text, leading to improved fluency, accuracy, and speed. This approach allows students
to internalize vocabulary, syntax, and comprehension strategies, ultimately boosting their overall
reading proficiency. Students will have the opportunity to practice repeated readings in Units 1, 2, 7,
9 and 10.


Foundational Skills 1


**Note:** Each time students encounter a new section of text in the Reader, the lesson includes new
vocabulary words and/or phrases to accompany the section of text. There are lessons in which
students reread sections of the Reader, for the purpose of building fluency. These lessons do not
introduce new vocabulary or have a vocabulary chart.


~~**UNIT AND LESSON FEATURES**~~


Within each Teacher Guide, you will find the following elements in the order listed:


  - A **Table of Contents** provides a quick overview of the time allocation, skills, and activities included in
each lesson and the unit.


  - Individual **Lessons** for the unit:


    - Each lesson begins with a list of the **Primary Focus Objectives** . These objectives are tagged
with the corresponding Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) standards. The objectives
are repeated in subsequent parts of the lesson in association with the specific instructional
activity with which they are associated. The order of the TEKS footer follows the order of the
progression of the lesson. By following this sequence, educators can scaffold learning effectively,
ensuring that students build upon prior knowledge and skills as they advance through the
curriculum. This systematic arrangement facilitates coherent instruction and enhances student
comprehension and retention.


    - Next is a list of the **Formative Assessment** opportunities within the lesson. These assessments
are linked to the Primary Focus Objectives and are also tagged with the corresponding TEKS
standards. Not every Primary Focus Objective is evaluated in every lesson. Rather, specific
objectives are evaluated in different lessons. Over the course of the entire unit, the Primary
Focus Objectives are assessed on multiple occasions, so teachers have a clear sense of
individual student progress with regard to unit skills before the end of the unit.


    - A **Lesson at a Glance** chart lists the lesson’s instructional activities, the materials needed, and
the amount of time allotted for each activity.


    - An **Advance Preparation** section delete prompts teachers to select and/or prepare lesson
materials prior to the lesson. Whenever a lesson activity suggests that the teacher write
something on the board/chart paper, this information is included in Advance Preparation.
Additionally, this type of material, as well as any activity pages that the teacher will model
completing with students, is also available online as **digital components** that the teacher may
access and project during the lesson. Finally, **Universal Access** preparation prompts are also
included to ensure that teachers are ready to adapt specific activities as needed for Emergent
Bilingual Students or students who need additional support.


    - Throughout each lesson, **Support** and **Challenge** sidebars provide further guidance to assist
teachers in differentiating instruction. **Emergent Bilingual Students** sidebars provide specific
tips for working with Emergent Bilingual Students.


    - **Take-Home Material** is also identified at the end of some lessons to maximize reinforcement
of skills taught during the lesson and to encourage family member involvement. Use of these

activity pages is optional but highly recommended. Should you choose to use them, please
distribute the pages to students and instruct them to take them home to complete. At your
discretion, these take-home pages may also be used in classroom centers during other times of
the day.


   - Foundational Skills Acceleration **Additional Support** activities are suggested at the end of
each lesson for more practice and follow-up reinforcement of skills outside the 30-minute
instructional block devoted to the program. These activities can be used with any students
needing more help, including students with special needs and Emergent Bilingual Students.


**• Student Performance Assessment(s)** representing an end-of-unit assessment are included in the
final lesson(s) of the unit.


**• Pausing Point** suggestions for further practice and reinforcement appear at the end of the unit,
following the last unit lesson. Pausing Point activities are organized by the unit objectives they
address. **It is strongly recommended that you pause for one or two days at the end of each**
**unit to solidify the skills introduced in it.** All students will benefit from an additional opportunity
to reread pages from the decodable student Readers. It is particularly important to make use of
targeted activities if the end-of unit assessment and/or formative assessments indicate that any
students are experiencing difficulties with specific skills taught during the unit.


**• Teacher Resources**, comprised of assorted forms and documents for monitoring student progress,
and an answer key for the unit Activity Book, complete each Teacher Guide.


**• Appendices** providing more detailed information about the program are sometimes included in the
Teacher Guide.


~~**STUDENT COLLABORATION: STRATEGIES, STRUCTURES, AND ROUTINES**~~


Throughout the Grade 3 Foundational Skills curriculum, you will find routine instructional guidance
for the following skills:


 - Vocabulary development


 - Glossary Usage


 - Dictionary Usage


Instructional guidance will be framed similarly to the following:


**Vocabulary Instruction**


Preview the following vocabulary words that students will encounter in this section
of the Reader. Have students work with a **partner** to decode the words in isolation
first and go over the correct pronunciation of each word.


Foundational Skills 1


Conduct a **brief discussion** about the meanings of the different words in the chart.
For example, show the words and **ask** students what prior knowledge they may have
about these words and where they might have seen them. Briefly explain them as
you preview the vocabulary chart.


**Glossary Instruction**


Model how to use the Glossary in the Reader to discover the pronunciation and
definition of words in bold. Review the definition **together** and ask students to **share**
their understanding of the word. Call on a few students to share their thoughts.


**Dictionary Instruction**


Model how to use the dictionary to discover the pronunciation of words in bold.
Review the definition **together** and ask students to **share** their understanding of the
word. Call on a few students to share their thinking.


Allow students to work in **partners** to find the entry mainstay in the dictionary.
Monitor students and provide feedback on using the alphabet and locating guide
words, as needed.


When providing Vocabulary, Glossary, or Dictionary instruction it is important to not only analyze
the meanings of the words but also the words’ pronunciation and syllable breakdown. This will
support students in analyzing word parts and how they affect the meaning of the words.


To encourage student interaction during this time, the following instructional strategies can be
strategically integrated into the lessons to develop vocabulary, oral language and oracy within the
designated time frame for each section of the lesson.

~~**ESTABLISH PROTOCOLS**~~


Throughout the Grade 3 Foundational Skills lessons, students will be working in partners and
individually. It is important to establish clear expectations and protocols for student success during
these instructional segments.


**Self-selecting Texts**


Establish a protocol to support students in selecting recreational reading materials. This should
include providing books of varying complexity for students to choose from during self-sustained
reading time. Students should practice self-selecting texts based on their interests and reading
ability. Meeting with students 1:1 or in small groups to coach them on effective selection practices
can support students in selecting texts independently.


**Self-sustained Reading**


Consider both quantitative and qualitative factors for students when selecting book options. Offer
a variety of genres. Encourage students to explore any books that interest them regardless of
their reading level. Incorporate practices of pre-reading, re-reading, and progress monitoring to
encourage students to practice their reading skills throughout a variety of texts.


**Intentional Partnerships**


Intentional partnerships are important to build capacity in student learning. When using
collaboration structures consider the varying levels of students academically within the classroom
in conjunction with the purpose of the activity. For example, students who are on similar levels may
partner well to practice fluency. On the other hand, students who need more support may benefit
from working with students who have more advanced reading skills. Both types of partnerships are
important to student learning.


**Choral Reading**


Choral reading is used to provide more opportunities for students to read aloud. Choral reading is
a reading structure where all students read aloud, practicing fluency and expression (prosody) in
unison. This can be carried out as a whole class, in small groups, or partnerships. The purpose of
reading stories chorally is for students to improve fluency, self-confidence, and motivation.


**Echo Reading**


Echo reading is when students listen to a sentence, paragraph, or excerpt modeled aloud by the
teacher and then repeat it back. When students echo the reading, they will focus on matching tone,
accuracy, and pace.


**Partner Reading Feedback**


During partner reading, students will have the opportunity to provide feedback to one another.
This instructional strategy will be used throughout all ten skills units and provides opportunities.
It is important to be consistent with this protocol so that students learn to provide and receive
constructive feedback to their peers. In some instances, students might feel more comfortable
asking their peers questions or for help on academic work, and peer feedback can provide this
opportunity. As students listen to their peers read, they can also improve their fluency by hearing a
peer model fluent reading with appropriate rate, accuracy, and prosody (expression).


Foundational Skills 1


~~**UNIT 1 ORGANIZATION**~~


Unit 1 launches the Grade 3 Skills curriculum. The Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills focused on
foundational reading skills have several similarities between Grade 2 and Grade 3, primarily because
they are designed to build upon each other progressively. By Grade 3, students have been taught
most of the necessary code knowledge needed to read and spell most words in American English,
including all short, long, or variant vowels; most digraphs, diphthongs, trigraphs, blends, and silent
letters; several syllable division patterns; and multiple affixes. The Grade 3 curriculum increases the
rigor by identifying advanced codes in multisyllabic words, teaching less common sound-spelling
patterns, introducing homophones, and recognizing stressed and unstressed syllables.


**Placement Assessment Lessons (1–2)**


During these lessons, all students will participate in two placement assessments to evaluate their
knowledge of the skills taught in the Grade 2 program. Detailed instructions are provided for
analyzing each student’s performance, along with suggestions for grade-wide planning to determine
the most effective and efficient way to group students for phonics instruction. **It is imperative that**
**students be placed in groups that correspond with their reading abilities. Students must**
**receive instruction that is a good match for their current reading abilities and knowledge of**
**the code.**


**Back-to-School Week Lessons (3–5)**


The Back-to-School lessons reacquaint students with the daily routines and exercises. In addition,
the Back-to-School lessons prepare students for the placement assessments that follow by
providing practice and review of reading skills and code knowledge.


~~**VOWEL SPELLINGS**~~


Vowel sounds are made with an open mouth and unobstructed flow of air. There are nineteen vowel
sounds in English. Consider quickly reviewing these in Unit 1. These are the single-letter spellings for
the five “short” vowel sounds:


  - ‘o’ > /o/ ( _hop_ )


  - ‘e’ > /e/ ( _pet_ )


  - ‘a’ > /a/ ( _hat_ )


  - ‘i’ > /i/ ( _it_ )


  - ‘u’ > /u/ ( _but_ )


In previous grades, students have also been taught vowel digraph spellings such as ‘ee’, ‘aw’, ‘oe’,
and ‘ai’. They should also be familiar with tricky spellings for vowel sounds, like the letter ‘a,’ which
routinely stands for /a/ ( _cat_ ), as well as /ae/ ( _table_ ), /o/ ( _lava_ ), and schwa ( _about_ ). These skills are
revisited and reviewed throughout the curriculum.


Introduction
**11**


**12**



~~**CONSONANT SPELLINGS**~~


By Grade 3, students should have mastered the basic code spelling for each consonant sound and
some common spelling alternatives. Consider quickly reviewing these in Unit 1:


 - ‘t’ > /t/ ( _top_ ), ‘tt’ > /t/ ( _sitting_ ), and ‘ed’ > /t/ ( _asked_ )


 - ‘d’ > /d/ ( _dot_ ), ‘dd’ > /d/ ( _add_ ), and ‘ed’ > /d/ ( _filled_ )


 - ‘p’ > /p/ ( _pot_ ) and ‘pp’ > /p/ ( _napping_ )


 - ‘b’ > /b/ ( _bat_ ) and ‘bb’ > /b/ ( _rubbing_ )


 - ‘c’ > /k/ ( _cat_ ), ‘k’ > /k/ ( _kid_ ), ‘cc’ > /k/ ( _hiccup_ ), and ‘ck’ > /k/ ( _black_ )


 - ‘g’ > /g/ ( _gift_ ) and ‘gg’ > /g/ ( _egg_ )


 - ‘ch’ > /ch/ ( _chin_ ) and ‘tch’ > /ch/ ( _itch_ )


 - ‘j’ > /g/ ( _jump_ ), ‘g’ > /g/ ( _gem_ ), and ‘ge’ > /ge/ ( _fringe_ )


 - ‘f’ > /f/ ( _fit_ ) and ‘ff’ > /f/ ( _stuff_ )


 - ‘v’ > /v/ ( _vet_ ) and ‘ve’ > /v/ ( _twelve_ )


 - ‘s’ > /s/ ( _sun_ ), ‘ss’ > /s/ ( _dress_ ), ‘c’ > /s/ ( _cent_ ), ‘se’ > /s/ ( _rinse_ ), and ‘ce’ > /s/ ( _prince_ )


 - ‘z’ > /z/ ( _zip_ ), ‘zz’ > /z/ ( _buzz_ ), and ‘s’ > /z/ ( _dogs_ )


 - ‘th’ > / ~~th/~~ ( _thin_ ) as a spelling for unvoiced /th/


 - ‘th’ > / ~~th/~~ ( _them_ ) as a spelling for voiced /th/


 - ‘m’ > /m/ ( _mad_ ) and ‘mm’ > /m/ ( _swimming_ )


 - ‘n’ > /n/ ( _nut_ ), ‘nn’ > /n/ ( _running_ ), and ‘kn’ > /n/ ( _knock_ )

 - ‘y’ > /y/ ( _yes_ )


 - ‘x’ > /x/ ( _tax_ ) as a spelling for the sound combination /x/ (/k/ + /s/)


 - ‘qu’> /qu/ ( _quit_ ) as a spelling for the sound combination /qu/ (/k/ + /w/)


Foundational Skills 1


The list includes the basic code spelling for each consonant sound and some common spelling
alternatives. When a sound can be spelled more than one way, we say it has spelling alternatives.
Common consonant digraphs _wh_, _sh_, _th_, _ng_, _nk_, and _ck_ as well as _ch_ and _tch_ are reviewed at the
beginning of this unit.


The consonant list also illustrates another kind of complexity in our writing system: the existence
of what we call _tricky spellings_ . When a spelling can represent more than one sound, we say it
is a tricky spelling. For example, notice the tricky spelling ‘s’ can stand for /s/ as in _cats_ or /z/
as in _dogs_ . Tricky spellings cause problems for us when we are reading. When we come upon an
unfamiliar printed word with an ‘s’ in it, we may need to try pronouncing the ‘s’ as /s/ and then as
/z/ to correctly identify the word. This is also true of digraph and trigraph spellings, such as: (1) ‘sh’
in _shop_ ; (2) ‘ng’ in _sing_ ; (3) ‘se’ in _rinse_ ; and (4) ‘tch’ as a spelling for /ch/ as in _itch_ .


In digraph spellings, two letters stand for one sound, but they are not the same two letters. You
may choose to teach students the terms _digraph_ and _trigraph_ . An alternative, which works for
both digraphs and trigraphs, is to characterize the letters as a “letter team,” where two or more
letters work together to stand for one sound. Whatever terms you use, it is extremely important
for students to understand that a letter can stand for a single sound all by itself, or it can work
with other letters to stand for a single sound. For example, when discussing the word _rinse_, you are
encouraged to talk about how the ‘s’ and the ‘e’ work together as a letter team to stand for the /s/
sound, just like the letters ‘t’ and ‘h’ work together to stand for the /th/ sound in the word _with_ .


The consonant sounds are listed in a particular order to help you learn more about the sounds. The
first fourteen consonants are unvoiced and voiced pairs such as /s/ and /z/, /f/ and /v/. When
comparing these sounds, you will notice your vocal box vibrates when saying voiced consonants,
while it does not with unvoiced consonants. The voiced and voiceless pairs sometimes “share”
spellings. For example, ’s’ is a spelling for the voiceless /s/ in _cats_ and the voiced /z/ in _dogs_ . Having
a deep understanding of the sounds of our language can help you explain sounds and spellings to
students.


An understanding of the sounds of the language and the similarities among them can also help you
understand students’ spelling. Sometimes even the strangest looking “invented” spellings make
sense if you understand which sounds are like other sounds. Young children often misspell a word by
choosing a spelling for a sound that is like the sound they are trying to spell. For example, a student
who writes chump for jump has confused sounds made with the same mouth position. The ‘ch’
spelling can therefore be seen as closer to the correct spelling than we might initially assume.


Unit 1 specifically focuses on the following skills:


  - reading and spelling multisyllabic words with consonant digraphs and trigraphs: _wh_, _sh_, _th_, _ng_, _nk_, _ck_,
_tch_, _ch_, _dge_, _ge_, _ph_, _gh_, _kn_, _gn_, _igh_, _ear_ (hear/wear), _eer_, _ore_, _ere_ (here/there), _air_, and _are_


  - reading and spelling multisyllabic words with closed syllables


  - reading and spelling multisyllabic words with closed-syllable VCCV, VCV, and VCCCV syllable division
patterns with accent shift

~~**REVIEW OF TRICKY WORDS**~~


The term _Tricky Word_ is used in this program to refer to a word not pronounced quite the way
you would expect based on the letters in its printed form, or not spelled quite the way you would
expect based on the sounds in the spoken word. Remind students to use their puzzling skills, such
as chunking words into syllables, trying alternative sounds for specific spellings, referring to the
Individual Code Chart and Spelling Trees, and using context when they encounter challenging words.
If you find that students still need additional practice decoding these tricky spellings, you can
choose among tricky spelling activities listed in the Additional Support activities at the end of the
lessons and in the Pausing Point.


A few words should be said about “sight words.” The term _sight word_ is often used to describe a
common word students should practice reading and learn to recognize rapidly. At the same time,
a sight word may describe a Tricky Word. It is necessary to distinguish between words that are
genuinely tricky (words like _one_, _of_, _two_, _who_, and _could_ ) and words that are high frequency but
pronounced as expected (words like _in_, _at_, _on_, _this_, _that_, and _up_ ). Words in this last category should
not be taught as Tricky Words, because there is nothing tricky about them. They can be read via
blending, and students should be encouraged to read them that way.


Tricky Words are introduced in this unit on an as-needed basis in the context of the different
selections included in the Reader. Tricky Words should be taught in the lessons before the reading
selections are assigned. When introducing Tricky Words, be sure to draw attention to the parts read
(and spelled) just as students would expect based on what they have learned so far, and point out
the tricky parts of each word. (See Appendix A for more detailed information about Tricky Words.)


The Tricky Words taught in this unit are:


 - Lesson 3 - _pirates_


 - Lesson 7 - _desert_, _tortoise_


 - Lesson 8 - _drought_, _solution_, _baobab_


 - Lesson 10 - _neighbors_, _flooded_


 - Lesson 14 - _encouragement_


~~**HIGH-FREQUENCY WORDS**~~


In addition to addressing Tricky Words and tricky spellings, this program emphasizes the reading
and spelling of high-frequency words carefully selected from word lists compiled by researchers
Edward William Dolch and Edward Fry. These lists are instrumental in aiding students, particularly
young learners, to become more proficient readers by focusing on words that frequently appear in
English reading materials.


Foundational Skills 1


Specifically for Grade 3 students, the lists include 132 words, of which this program provides explicit
instruction for 98. These words are selected based on their prevalence across various unit Readers,
ensuring instruction is both relevant and practical. Instruction is integrated into lessons at points
where students will naturally encounter these words within the assigned sections of the Readers.


The program encourages students to identify and recall previously taught high-frequency words
to reinforce learning, thereby gradually expanding their lexicon through repeated exposure. This
strategic approach ensures that students learn to recognize and use these essential words and
improve their reading fluency and comprehension.


The curriculum includes a structured approach for teaching high-frequency words, starting with the
introduction of eight to twelve keywords at the beginning of each unit, selected for their relevance
and frequency in the unit’s text. Words are introduced using phonetic sounding and Spelling Cards
for decoding. Throughout the unit, these words are reviewed in various contexts, including through
decode/encode games and fluency checkpoints to assess automaticity and fluency. This ensures
that students engage with the words multiple times, enhancing their reading skills and confidence.


The high-frequency words taught in this unit are:


  - Lesson 3 - _night, about_


  - Lesson 4 - _tree, story_


  - Lesson 5 - _thought_


  - Lesson 7 - _every, began_


  - Lesson 8 - _hard_


  - Lesson 11 - _river, small_


  - Lesson 13 - _near_


~~**REVIEW OF MULTISYLLABIC WORDS**~~


Multisyllabic words that feature code knowledge taught in previous grades are reviewed in Unit 1
lessons. However, a few multisyllabic words are used in the Reader in order to keep readability levels
as easy as possible for this first Reader in Grade 3.

~~**READER: CAMPFIRE TALES**~~


The Reader for Unit 1 follows a group of campers during their Friday night campfire, a time
dedicated to sharing stories. Led by camp leader Jen, they gather around the fire pit, eagerly
anticipating the storytelling session. This Friday’s theme is “family stories,” where each camper
shares a story passed down within their family.


Jen starts with a tale from Poland about a magical peach tree granting wishes, teaching the
importance of selflessness. Matteo shares a Mexican story about a singing cactus and a jealous
raven, emphasizing everyone’s unique gifts. Sadie tells an African story of a clever rabbit leading
a community effort to overcome drought, highlighting leadership and teamwork. Asha recounts a
cautionary tale about a distracted boy learning the value of responsibility and focus. Jack narrates
a story about a selfish deer learning empathy and kindness. Lastly, Winnie shares a story about a
brave little fish overcoming fear, inspiring courage and exploration.


Each story carries a moral lesson, fostering values like kindness, respect, and bravery. The campers
enjoy marshmallows and bond over these tales, carrying the lessons and memories back to their
cabins.


Each Reader has been carefully written to progress in complexity across the curriculum.
Comprehension is the goal of learning to read. To this end, comprehension discussion questions are
included in the Teacher Guide.


It is strongly recommended that you have students engage in partner reading. Partner reading
involves two students taking turns reading both new and old stories aloud to each other. The
National Reading Panel (2000) found that repeated oral reading boosted reading achievement,
and partner reading is an efficient way to conduct repeated oral reading. Planning and establishing
a partner reading routine with students will help this activity run smoothly; you should take into
consideration: (1) where students will partner read in the classroom; (2) good partner reading
manners, such as taking turns; and (3) what to do when students finish reading a story before other
partner pairs.


In addition to partner reading, there are other effective oral reading methods. Some suggestions
are:


 - Whole group reading: Students follow along as classmates take turns reading aloud. However, avoid
“Round Robin” reading.


 - Small group reading: Some students can read aloud in a small group with the teacher, while other
students partner read or engage in other activities.


During reading time, it is important to circulate and listen to students read. Utilize the provided
Anecdotal Reading Record located in the Teacher Resources section at the end of this Teacher
Guide to note students’ progress. You can make multiple copies of the blank record to have on hand
when listening to students read aloud. You should strive to hear every student read aloud at least
once or twice each week. Comprehension is the goal of learning to read. To this end, suggested
comprehension discussion questions are provided in instruction.


Foundational Skills 1


~~**CODE KNOWLEDGE**~~


Students who have mastered the letter-sound correspondences taught in this program up to this
point have learned most of the important letter-sound correspondences they need to read English
writing. The ones they have not explicitly studied are relatively rare letter-sound correspondences
that come up perhaps once in every 2,000–3,000 words. Most students will be able to decode the
occasional unusual spelling by using the puzzling strategies that you have taught them. For this
reason, we will continue to encourage you to ask students to use the Individual Code Chart, syllable
chunking, and context to puzzle out unfamiliar words. In Grade 3, many students are already reading
trade books and other publications that are not controlled for decodability.


Any student who has done well with the program up to this point can be encouraged—or, if you like,
required—to read trade books and textbooks written at an appropriate level. Students should be
strongly encouraged to self-select reading material. It is important to move students toward taking
responsibility for their own learning.


Prior to entering Grade 3, students who have been instructed in this program from Kindergarten will
have been taught all of the following code knowledge.





Introduction

~~**UNIT 1 ASSESSMENT**~~


**Placement Assessments**


As noted earlier, a placement assessment of prerequisite skills needed for successful participation
in Grade 3 instruction will be administered to all students during Lessons 1–2 of this unit. Each
Placement Assessment consists of two parts: a spelling assessment and a reading assessment. The
assessments will help you determine which students have the knowledge and skills they need to
profit from Grade 3 Skills instruction and which students you will need to regroup to an earlier point
in the Skills program.


Foundational Skills 1


Complete the analysis for each student well before the end of Unit 1 instruction. This analysis will
inform decisions as to whether students are ready to continue with Grade 3, Unit 2 instruction or
whether other instruction is needed to ensure mastery of skills taught at the Grade 2 level. Students
may lack these skills for a variety of reasons, including being new to the program, perhaps having
used different approaches and/or instructional materials in previous grades, difficulty in thoroughly
mastering these skills despite having received instruction in the program, and so on. Whatever the
reason, it is important to identify code knowledge gaps now and address them rather than simply
push students ahead through the Grade 3 materials.


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


In every lesson, formative assessments are marked for monitoring individual student performance
and progress in key skills. Quick “Checks for Understanding” to evaluate classroom performance are
also designated in each lesson.


Careful attention to this information, collected daily, will enable teachers to quickly determine which
students may benefit from reteaching and/or more practice in particular skills using the Additional
Support activities found at the end of each lesson.


**Student Performance Assessment**


In Lessons 15 and 16, you will be prompted to administer a multipart end-of-unit assessment. In the
first part, you will work one-on-one with students to complete the Fluency Assessment. Students
will engage in a review activity while awaiting their turn for the assessment. The Reading and
Spelling portion of the assessment takes place during the first 20 minutes of the second lesson.
Once students have completed the assessment, they will have time for Self-Sustained Reading.
Use time in this lesson to finish working with students who still need to complete the Fluency
Assessment in the previous lesson.


The target words in each of these assessments include the vowel sound/spellings taught in this
unit; distractors have been intentionally selected because they represent frequent sound/spelling
confusions. Student performance on these assessments is a good indicator of whether students
have mastered the new sound/spellings.


~~**CURSIVE WRITING**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


At Grade 3, students are expected to write neatly in cursive, using correct letter formation and
leaving space between words. Throughout the program, teachers are prompted to remind students
of this expectation and provide corrective feedback. For students who need additional review, the
Grade 2 curriculum contains fourteen lessons of instruction in cursive writing. The cursive program
covers the lower- and uppercase alphabets and with the accompanying Activity Book, it provides
both a solid introduction to students new to cursive and a timely refresher to more experienced
students.


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.


Introduction
**19**


**20**



Although this volume contains all the cursive instruction, the lessons are not designed to be
completed in the time allotted for Unit 1. Teachers should proceed at a pace that is right for their
classes, allowing new students of cursive to become comfortable writing each letter or letter group
before introducing new ones. Students reviewing cursive can sharpen their penmanship skills. Once
students have learned all the letters, have them practice by completing select writing assignments
in cursive.


Note that the lessons and activity pages do not comprise an exhaustive handwriting program, and
teachers may wish to consult other sources for information on topics such as writing posture, pencil
grip, and differentiated instruction for left-handed students.


~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice the Unit 1 skills can be found in the
Pausing Point section included after the last lesson.


~~**APPENDICES**~~


Unit 1 includes three appendices that provide additional information about the Grade 3 program.
Appendix A, “An Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program,” explains the philosophy and theoretical
principles that underlie the approach to teaching reading. Appendix B, “Grade 3 Scope and
Sequence,” provides an overview of the skills taught in each of the Grade 3 units. Appendix C,
“Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words,” explains how students learned to use chunking, or
syllabication, to read longer, multisyllable words in Grade 3.

~~**ADDITIONAL MATERIALS**~~


Some additional materials (most typically available in Grade 3 classrooms) are needed for specific
lessons of Unit 1. These materials are always listed in the Lesson at a Glance chart at the beginning
of each lesson. For your convenience, a complete list of these additional materials is included here.


The number in parentheses indicates the first lesson in which the materials are used:


  - whiteboards and dry erase markers (3)


  - paper and pencil (3)


  - dice (4)


  - whisper phones (15)


  - colored pencils (17)


  - recreational reading options (16)


  - Digital Components: Throughout this unit and others, whenever the lesson suggests you model the
completion of an activity page or prepare a chart to display, you may use the digital version provided
in the program’s online materials. (3)


  - User Guide: You may wish to consult the program’s User Guide throughout this unit and others for
best practices and strategies on Supporting All Learners including Emergent Bilingual Students,
Gifted/Talented Students, Dual Language Students, and Students with Disabilities. The User Guide
can be found in the program’s online materials. (1)


**Back-to-School Lessons**


After the summer break, all students need time to reacclimate to the school environment. The
Back-to-School lessons are designed to provide just such an opportunity for students. They will


Introduction
**21**


**22**



also provide an opportunity to begin to get to know students as you observe the skills they use to
complete these review lessons in which no new skills are introduced.


These Back-to-School lessons (Lessons 3–5) have been created to help students remember the
daily routines and exercises associated with the program. Basic skills from Grade 2 are reviewed
in these lessons. The selection of material for use in these lessons, which includes skills that all
students should have already mastered, is intentional, so the primary focus is on familiarization with
the routines and pacing of a typical Skills lesson, rather than learning new skills.


Please take the time to teach these procedures thoroughly, making sure you present at least part
of every exercise in each lesson. Use the time recommendations for each exercise as a guideline. If
you find you have exceeded the time estimated for the initial activities in a lesson, please adjust the
remaining exercises accordingly by doing fewer items per exercise.


As students relearn the procedures, your presentation of each lesson will become more efficient.
Do not get frustrated in these first days if it takes a little longer to do portions of the lessons. It will
come back to students, and everyone will benefit from the time taken to establish a routine.


The following exercises are included in each Back-to-School lesson:


**Individual Code Chart Review**


Students who participated in the program in Kindergarten, Grade 1, and Grade 2 are very familiar
with the introduction and review of letter-sound correspondences using the same format
incorporated in the Grade 3 Individual Code Chart.


**Note:** The exercises in the Back-to-School lessons are not designed to teach letter-sound
correspondences to students who have not mastered the code in earlier grades. Students who have
large gaps in their code knowledge will be identified through the placement assessments presented
during Lessons 1–2 of this unit so they can be placed in the appropriate level of materials that meet
their individual instructional needs.


As noted earlier, the Back-to-School lessons are intended to “prime the pump,” reminding students
to think about letter-sound correspondences and the written English code after the summer break.
Keep the Individual Code Chart exercises briskly paced so they do not become tedious.


Do encourage students to use their Individual Code Charts whenever they are reading and/or
spelling throughout the day, not just during the Skills instruction portion of the language arts block.
This reinforces applying the skills they are learning during language arts whenever they are reading
and writing.


To take full advantage of the Individual Code Chart (see sample in Teacher Resources), it is
important that you and students understand the logic with which the various letter-sound
correspondences have been grouped on the Individual Code Chart:


Foundational Skills 1


  - The spellings for each sound are arranged in left-to-right order on the Individual Code Chart, from the
most frequent way the sound is spelled to the least frequent way the sound is spelled.


    - For example, on Chart 1, the left-to-right sequence of the spellings for the /t/ sound indicates
that the most frequent spelling for /t/ is ‘t’, with the spelling alternatives ‘tt’ and ‘ed’ being less
common spellings. Note that this same information is communicated by the length of the power
bar.


  - Consonant sounds are grouped separately from vowel sounds.


  - Consonant sounds resembling one another are often included on the same chart. For example, Code
Charts 1–4 show voiced and unvoiced consonant sounds and similar spellings.


  - Code Charts 5–6 include all remaining, unrelated consonant sounds and spellings.


  - Spellings for short vowel sounds are included on Code Chart 7, with the spellings for long vowel
sounds on Code Chart 8. Code Chart 9 groups all vowel digraph spellings, and Code Chart 10 includes
the spellings for r-controlled vowels.


**Chaining**


Students have been completing chaining exercises since the earliest Kindergarten units. This critical
activity reinforces students’ abilities to manipulate the sounds in words in which only a single
phoneme/grapheme is changed (added or deleted) at a time, like _cat_  - _hat_ ; _cat_  - _cab_ ; _at_  - _hat_ ; or
_cat_  - _at_ .


At Grade 3, this activity is adapted to change words by adding or deleting digraphs, trigraphs, and
entire syllables, like _cat_  - _chat_  - _chatting_ .


In the early grades, students chained by manipulating individual letter cards on either an individual
chaining folder or a group pocket chart. In Grade 3, chaining activities are completed by either the
teacher or the student writing on a blackboard, a whiteboard, a Smart Board, or chart paper.


**Dictation**


Simple dictation exercises are included frequently to remind students about the connection
between decoding and encoding (i.e., reading and writing). Encourage students to actively and
openly refer to their Individual Code Charts, if needed, during this portion of the lesson.


Introduction
**23**


**24**



Once the dictation is completed, review and model the correct spelling for each word and instruct
students to correct their own work by simply crossing out any incorrect spelling, then copying and
writing the correct spelling next to it. There should be no stigma associated with having spelled
a word incorrectly. Teachers may want to comment that it’s normal to make mistakes, especially
at the beginning of the year. Emphasize the importance of recognizing and understanding when a
mistake has been made and correcting the error.


It is recommended that students complete dictation exercises in a notebook, which offers the
advantage of providing an ongoing written record of each student’s work.


**Oral Reading**


The Unit 1 Reader is introduced in the first lesson. Some students may find these initial sections of
the Reader challenging after summer vacation. You will read (solo) some parts of the story aloud as
students listen and follow along. The class will then join you sometimes in reading a sentence or two
aloud together. The point of reading these stories chorally is to ensure a measure of reading success
and enjoyment in the opening days of school.


**Activity Pages**


Activity pages are used in most lessons of the curriculum. During the initial lessons, these activity
pages are to reacquaint students with procedures used to answer questions and complete activity
pages. You will note that the lesson directs you to model this for students. Please be sure to
model the responses to several activity page questions in each lesson. As noted earlier, if there is
not enough time to model and complete all the questions, especially in the early lessons, model
responses to a few questions instead of all.


Please do not skip the modeling and simply assign students to complete the activity pages entirely
on their own at this point in the year.


Throughout this unit and others, whenever the lesson suggests the teacher model the completion
of an activity page, you should choose the most convenient and effective method of reproducing
and displaying the activity page for all to see. This may include making a transparency of the activity
page and using an overhead projector, scanning the page and projecting it on a Smart Board, or
writing the activity page exercises on the board/chart paper.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


In each of the first two lessons of the Grade 3 Skills curriculum, students
will complete placement assessments to help you gauge their mastery of
foundational skills taught thus far. Each placement assessment consists of two
parts: a spelling assessment and a reading assessment. The assessments will
help you determine which students have the knowledge and skills they need
to profit from Grade 3 Skills instruction and which students you will need to
regroup to an earlier point in the Skills program.


For the spelling assessment, dictate each word, use it in a sentence, and
then read the word again, allowing students time to write it. Complete the
assessment by dictating the complete sentence provided, allowing students
time to write the complete sentence. Use the Placement Assessment –
Analysis of Spelling Errors document in Unit 1 Teacher Resources to analyze
patterns in the errors students make.


For the reading assessment, students will read a story silently and then answer
comprehension questions. The stories and questions are in students’ Activity
Books. “Heroes” is 278 words long. It uses the most common spellings for
long vowel patterns and consonant blends/digraphs, all of which are taught
in Grade 2. Use the Placement Assessment – Analysis of Reading Errors
document in the Unit 1 Teacher Resources to analyze patterns in the errors
students make.


Complete this analysis for each student well before the end of Unit 1
instruction. This analysis will inform decisions as to whether students are
ready to continue with Grade 3, Unit 2 instruction or whether other instruction
is needed to ensure mastery of skills taught at the Grade 2 level. Students may
lack these skills for a variety of reasons, including being new to the program,
perhaps having used different approaches and/or instructional materials in
previous grades, difficulty in thoroughly mastering these skills despite having
received instruction in the program, and so on. Whatever the reason, it is
important to identify code knowledge gaps now and address them rather than
simply push students ahead through the Grade 3 materials.


Grade 2 teachers were asked to pass forward a summary of results for each
student to Grade 3 teachers. A strong performance on the end-of-year Grade
2 assessment is an indication that the student should be ready for Grade 3
instruction, even if his or her performance on this placement assessment
is now slightly below his performance at the end of the Grade 2 school year.
Some learning loss is expected during the summer months if students have
not been encouraged to continue reading.


Foundational Skills 1


**Universal Access**

  - Students who finish the assessments early can be engaged in independent
activities you have planned for them, such as quietly looking at trade books,
working at listening centers, or writing in journals. Remember, it is important
that your class maintains a calm environment conducive to student
assessment.


**Next Steps and Placement Indicated by Assessment Score**

  - To gain additional information on students’ mastery of foundational skills
taught thus far, pull aside students who missed all of the questions on the
reading assessment. Have these students reread the passage aloud to you.
This will allow you to identify whether the students lack decoding knowledge
to successfully answer the questions or if they may lack comprehension of
the text.


  - Be aware that some students may have little previous experience with
multiple-choice assessments. They may need support to answer the
questions even if they read the story and understood it. You may wish to have
borderline students read the story aloud you and then discuss it with you.


  - Analyze student responses and use them to inform small group instruction.
Depending on the level of skill gaps, consider reteaching skills that were
presented or consult the Grade 2 materials to target the specific skill. For
example, if you can identify the specific letter-sound correspondences
causing difficulty, or the specific Tricky Words he or she has not learned, you
may be able to provide extra practice sessions while the student participates
in Grade 3 instruction.


  - Students who demonstrate mastery of the content in the placement
assessments may be ready to practice more advanced skills. Consider
assessing for students’ understanding of trigraphs, such as _tch_, _igh_, _dge_, _eer_,
_ear_, _oul_, _ore_, _are_, _air_, and _ere_ . You may also provide a more advanced reading
assessment by providing a text with a higher Lexile level with complex
vocabulary and lengthier sentence structure.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


In each of the first two lessons of the Grade 3 Skills curriculum, students
will complete placement assessments to help you gauge their mastery of
foundational skills taught thus far. Each placement assessment consists
of two parts: a spelling assessment and a reading assessment. The
assessments will help you determine which students have the knowledge and
skills they need to profit from Grade 3 Skills instruction and which students
you will need to regroup to an earlier point in the Skills program.


For the spelling assessment, dictate each word, use it in a sentence, and
then read the word once more, allowing students time to write the word.
Complete the assessment by dictating the complete sentence provided,
allowing students time to write the complete sentence. Use the Placement
Assessment – Analysis of Spelling Errors document in the Unit 1 Teacher
Resources to analyze patterns in the errors students make.


For the reading assessment, students will read a story silently and then
answer comprehension questions. The stories and questions are in students’
activity books. “The Scavenger Hunt” is 382 words long. It uses words with
the most common long vowel and consonant digraph patterns and a few
multisyllabic words, all of which are taught in Grade 2. Use the Placement
Assessment – Analysis of Reading Errors document in Unit 1 Teacher
Resources to analyze patterns in the errors students make.


**Universal Access**

 - Gather reading materials of varying complexities for students to read if they
finish the assessment early.


 - Provide additional time for students as needed. Consider chunking questions
and tasks as a scaffold or expanding the white space on the page to help
students focus.


**Next Steps and Placement Indicated by Assessment Score**

 - To gain additional information on students’ mastery of foundational skills
taught thus far, pull aside students who missed all the questions on the
Reading Assessment. Have these students reread the passage aloud to you.
This will allow you to identify whether students lack decoding knowledge to
successfully answer the questions or if they may lack comprehension of the
text.


 - If the placement test indicates the student has limited code knowledge, seek
resources in the previous grade level materials and resources that target a
specific skill.


Foundational Skills 1


- It is highly recommended that all Grade 3 teachers meet as a grade-level
team to examine students’ scores across the entire grade level, rather than
having each teacher examine only the scores of students in his or her own
classroom. Homogeneous grouping for Skills instruction is the most efficient
and effective way to differentiate instruction and meet students’ needs when
teaching phonics skills. Once the grade-level team has examined the scores
of all students on these assessments, you may find that it makes sense to
regroup some students presently in different classrooms based on their
specific decoding skills for purposes of Skills instruction only.


- Teachers may wish to write each student’s name and placement assessment
scores on an index card for ease in grouping students, especially if multiple
teachers will be working with students across the grade-level.

  - Repeat the words from the code chart and model clapping, exaggerating the
sound of the digraphs while pointing to them in the words.


  - Model clapping the syllables while saying each word again. Draw attention to
how you only clapped once for each word. Prompt students to turn and talk
to hypothesize why you only clapped once for each word. Use the following
sentence stems:


    - I think you clapped once because . . .


    - After discussing with my partner, we concluded that the single clap
suggests . . .


  - Explain that each word has one syllable. Define a _syllable_ as “a word part with
one single vowel sound.”


  - Confirm that word has one syllable. Define a _syllable_ as “a word part with one
vowel sound.”


  - Write the word _thank_ on the board in cursive and ask students to read it.


  - Segment each sound in the word _thank_, th/a/nk, and ask students to find the

 - Define _multisyllabic words_ as “words with multiple syllables, or word parts
with one single vowel sound.”


 - Write _fishing_ on the board in cursive. Ask students to identify which
consonant digraph patterns they notice in the word and say them aloud
together while pointing to _sh_ and _ng_ .


 - Model aloud each sound in the word: f/i/sh/i/ng. Have students repeat
each sound as you point. Blend the sounds together to form the word. Ask
students to repeat the word.


 - Model how to split the word _fishing_ into two syllables. Students can use
consonants or consonant digraphs after a vowel sound to know where one
syllable ends and another begins. When splitting a word into its syllables,
digraphs like those in this lesson stick together because they make one
sound.


 - Point out that in the word _fishing_, the first syllable ends after the _sh_ digraph.


 - Explain how they will continue to practice syllabication and these consonant
digraph patterns in more multisyllabic words.


~~**PRACTICE WITH SPEAK AND SPELL (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students open to Activity Page 3.1.


 - Explain that for all activities, students are expected to write in cursive.
Additionally, when writing sentences, it’s important for them to leave spaces
between words.


 - Model leaving adequate space between words on the board by writing in
cursive the phrase "Thank you." Provide students with additional phrases to
practice writing in cursive.


 - Circulate and monitor to check for correct letter formation in cursive. Offer
feedback such as:


   - "Great job forming the letter 'a'! I like how you started at the top and
made a smooth, curved line."


   - "You're doing well with your cursive! Pay attention to the slant of your
letters. Try to keep them all at the same angle."


 - Model the Speak and Spell activity.


   - Instruct students to listen carefully for the syllables and sounds in the

  - Remind students that most English words play by the rules, meaning they
are pronounced and spelled as we would expect. There are a few words that
do not play by the rules, including some very common and important ones.
Words that do not play by the rules (i.e., words not pronounced and spelled
as expected) are called _Tricky Words_ .


  - Display the Tricky Word, read it aloud, and use it in a sentence:


    - _pirates_


  - Point out which parts of each word are regular and can be blended as you
would expect, and which parts are not regular and will either be taught later
or simply must be remembered.


    - Tricky Word: _pirates_


     - Expected: /p/, /ī/, /r/, /t/, /s/


    - Tricky spelling: the pattern a_e is pronounced /ĭ/


  - Direct students to write the Tricky Word on their whiteboard and underline
the letters that form the tricky spelling.

- Invite students to share what they already know about the meanings of this
word.


- Ask students to predict what the Reader might be about based on the title.


- Explain that _Campfire Tales_ contains many high-frequency words. These are
common words, so they will come across them often as they read, in both the
Reader and in many different texts. Explain that learning to recognize these
words and how to spell them will improve their overall reading and writing
fluency.


- Display this lesson’s two high-frequency words: _night_ and _about_ .


- Focus on the word _night_ . Underline the letters ‘igh.’ Remind students that
they may have learned that this trigraph is a spelling for the long /ie/ sound
as in _like_ .


- Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves: /n/ /igh/ /t/. Clarify the meaning
of _night_ as needed. Invite students to turn to a partner and use the word in a
sentence. For additional support, display the Spelling Cards for each sound.


- Focus on the word _about_ . Underline the vowel team _ou_ . Remind students
that they may have learned that these vowels together are sometimes
pronounced as a diphthong, or sliding vowel, that sounds like /ow/ as in
_mouse_ .


- Draw a line to divide the two syllables, a/bout. Say the syllables as you clap
them, then have students repeat in unison. Segment and blend the sounds in
each syllable: /a/ /b/ /ou/ /t/. Blend the syllables and read the word aloud.


- Explain that _about_ is a preposition used before a noun to mean “on the
subject of.” Provide the sentence starter “This morning before school, I was
thinking about…” Direct students to turn and talk to a partner to complete
the sentence.


- Provide students with a whiteboard and dry erase marker, and invite them to
write either one or two sentences using the high-frequency words _night_ and
_about_ . Remind students to write in cursive and to use their finger to make a
space between each word.


- Read page 1 of _Campfire Tales_ aloud.


- Pair students with intentional reading partners.


- Instruct students to partner read pages 2–3 of the Reader.


- Model partner reading with a student volunteer, alternating reading
sentences and providing assistance to each other as needed.


Foundational Skills 1


  - Direct reading partners to speak coherently and focus on reading with
appropriate pace and volume.


  - Record notes about mispronunciations, self-correction, pacing, transposition
of words, and expression.


  - Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension. Have students listen
actively and ask relevant questions to clarify any information from the text or
prompts. Ask the following question and prompt students to use context for
support, if needed. Example prompts include:


    - **Literal.** What day of the week does the text say is special for the group?
_(It is Friday.)_


       - **Evaluative:** What are some things that make is special? _(It is special_
_because they got to stay up past their bedtime, eat marshmallows_
_around a campfire, and spend time together.)_


    - **Inferential.** During what time of day is this text taking place? What
words or phrases in the text help you figure this out? _(it is nighttime, "the_
_first stars began to appear," "our shadows sink into the ground")_


    - **Literal.** What are the campers looking for as they run down to the fire
pit? _(long sticks to roast marshmallows on)_


    - **Literal.** What are the children talking to each other about as they look for
branches? _(the theme of the night's story time)_


    - **Evaluative.** Why is visiting a Texas National Preserve a unique and
valuable experience? _(Answers may vary but might include the unique_
_features and activities of the park.)_


    - **Literal.** What do the different children say about the campfire stories
they might hear? _(Asha hopes the stories aren't scary; Jack hopes the_
_theme is pirates.)_


  - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses.


~~**PRACTICE WITH PATTERN SEARCH (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Direct students to collaborate with a partner to search for and list out
on a piece of paper eleven words in the section they just read that are
multisyllabic—with two or three syllables—and follow the consonant digraph
patterns.


  - Direct partners to share the words they found and record them on the board.
Ask them to write down any they may have missed: _shadows_, _dripping_,
_marshmallows_, _shouted_, _holding_, _Asha_, _shivered_, _thinking_, _frightening_,
_jumping_, _whatever_ .

  - Read each word aloud, clapping the syllables. Direct students to echo you.


  - As time allows, have students mark the high-frequency words _night_ and
_about_ in the text.


  - Instruct students to write a phrase on their piece of paper using one of the
words from their list that are multisyllabic and follow the consonant digraph
patterns. Remind them that they examined the phrase “marshmallows
dripping” prior to reading.


  - Invite students to turn to an elbow partner, hold up their papers, and state
their phrase aloud.


Check for Understanding


During the Pattern Search, monitor and take note of which students were able to

identify the target skill. If a student writes down a word that does not contain the

target skill pattern, ask for clarification from the student. Informally ask students to

reread a written word aloud to you as you rotate to other students.

  - Have students take home Activity Page 3.2 to share with a family member.


**Lesson 3: Differentiated Instruction**
#### Additional Support


For additional practice with consonant digraphs, provide students with prepared
index cards. Write the digraphs _ch_, _th_, _wh_, and _sh_ on individual cards. Write the
letters ‘ut’, ‘in’, ‘op’, ‘at’, ‘en’, and ‘is’ on individual cards. Direct students to match
up digraphs with the other letter combinations to form as many real words as
possible. Ask them which combinations create real words and which create
nonsense words. For a challenge, provide letter chunks for multisyllabic words,
such as 'icken', 'istle', and ‘atter’ that can work with multiple consonant digraphs.

 - Explain that these rules can also be used when figuring out how to pronounce
a word.


 - Write _soaking_ and _locker_ on the board. Model cursive writing with proper
letter formation.


 - Model how you would determine the correct pronunciation of each word
based on the spelling, referring to _ck_ and ‘k’ Spelling Rules.


 - Focus on the word _soaking_ .


 - Review the spelling rules and eliminate the rules that are not relevant to the
word (r-controlled pattern, another consonant).


 - Point out that the remaining spelling rule tells you the _oa_ in _soaking_ is a long
vowel sound.


 - Pronounce _soaking_ .


 - Repeat the process with _locker_, utilizing its rule to confirm that the ‘o’ is a
short vowel sound /o/.


 - Reinforce that the spelling ‘k’ comes after a long vowel sound, and the
spelling _ck_ comes after a short vowel sound.


 - Explain that the ‘k’ and _ck_ rules apply to all syllables in a word, not just when
it is the final syllable. Underline the word _soak_ in _soaking_ and the word _lock_ in
_locker_ to reinforce this point.


~~**PLAY ROLL, FLIP, READ, WRITE (10 MIN.)**~~

~~**MORE SUPPORT WITH CONSONANT DIGRAPH CK**~~


Direct students to search for and write down eleven words in this lesson’s
assigned section of the Reader that have one syllable and where the base
word ends in the digraph _ck_ or the letter ‘k’: _rock_, _Jack_, _asked_, _talk_, _cracked_,
_drink_, _milk_, _drank_, _creek_, _sulked_, _sneak_ .


~~**MORE SUPPORT WITH FLUENCY**~~


Consider pairing students with varying reading levels to provide
opportunities for students to hear words their peers model correctly. One
way to create pairs is to rank the students by their reading proficiency,
starting with the most skilled and ending with the least. Split the ranked
list into two equal parts. Pair the highest-ranked student from the first half
with the highest-ranked student from the second half. Follow this pattern,
creating pairs down the list, until each student has a partner.

- Guide the class in reading Chapter 2, pages 16–18. Model fluent reading
for a paragraph, emphasizing proper pacing, expression, and intonation.
Demonstrate how to smoothly navigate through the text, maintaining a
natural flow that enhances comprehension. Pay particular attention to
phrasing and grouping words for meaningful expression.


- Pair students with intentional reading partners. Tell students that they will
partner-read the rest of Chapter 2. Direct students to alternate reading
sentences for the rest of Chapter 2, focusing on reading fluently with
appropriate pace and volume.


Foundational Skills 1


  - Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension, as well as to check for
students’ ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or
multiple-meaning words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant
questions to clarify any information from the text or prompts. Example
prompts include:


    - **Literal.** Who discovers where the music is coming from? _(Pedro the_
_tortoise and Lola the jackrabbit)_


    - **Evaluative.** What does the word _triumphant_ describe in the text? What
would you describe as _triumphant_ ? _(very pleased with himself, happy;_
_Answers may vary but could include winning a game, doing well on a_
_test, etc.)_


    - **Literal.** What does Rascal want to do to Melody, and why? _(He wanted to_
_steal her gift of music and fill the sky with his own music instead. He is_
_jealous of Melody.)_


    - **Inferential.** Why does Rascal feel ashamed, and what does Pedro the
tortoise tell him to help him understand and feel better? _(He is_
_ashamed for being jealous of Melody’s music. Pedro tells him that_
_everyone has their own talents.)_


    - **Evaluative.** What does it mean to have a special gift? _(Answers may vary_
_but could include that having a special gift means to be able to have or_
_do something unique to you.)_


  - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses.
Provide sentence stem as needed such as, . . . discovered where the music
is coming from. Triumphant means . . . Rascal wants to . . . Rascal feels
ashamed because . . ., and Pedro tells him . . . To have a special gift means . . .


  - As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record. Record notes about
mispronunciations, self-correction, pacing, transposition of words, and
expression.

~~**WRAP UP (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Direct students to Activity Page 7.2. Read the directions aloud.


 - Students will be answering questions about the story elements of the stories
while also utilizing ph or gh words from a word bank.


 - Release students to discuss with a partner. Provide sentence starters for
them to formulate their thoughts:


   - The most important part of the story is . . .


   - A major character in the story is ___.


   - I can use the word ___ to describe . . . in the story.


 - Once students discuss with a partner, prompt them to write their sentences
on the activity page. Remind students to write their responses in cursive.


Check for Understanding


While monitoring comprehension during the reading of the text, pay attention to

student responses and take notes regarding their individual reading ability in the

Anecdotal Reading Record. You can opt to confer with these students, asking them to

read a part of the text and then answer question(s) again. Collect Activity Page 7.2 to

assess their ability to spell words with the digraphs _ph_ and _gh_ while demonstrating

reading comprehension.

~~**MORE HELP WITH DIGRAPHS**~~


    - Work with students to create an anchor chart or reference sheet to help
students understand when to use the _ph_ and _gh_ digraphs. Consider
adapting TR 7.1 for this purpose. Clarify that _gh_ only makes the /f/ sound
after short vowel sounds, such as _cough_ and laugh. However, the ph can
be used in any part of a word, the beginning, middle, or end, to make the
/f/ sound.


    - Provide practice for students familiarizing themselves with the
digraphs ph and gh by encouraging them to create nonsense words and
presenting those words to a partner, being sure to say the ph and _gh_
digraphs correctly as /f/.


    - Provide additional practice for students in using words with the digraphs
_ph_ and _gh_ by encouraging them to write a rhyming poem about the
Reader using words containing the digraphs.

  - Explain that students will examine another high-frequency word.


  - Display this lesson’s high-frequency word: _hard_ .


  - Underline the letters ‘ar.’ Remind students that ‘r’ controls the way the vowel
before it sounds. In the word _hard_, ‘ar’ makes the /ar/ sound like in _car_ .
Sometimes ‘ar’ can make the /er/ sound like in _dollar_ . Have students say /ar/
with you as you point to the letters ‘ar.’

- Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves: h/ar/d. For additional support,
display the Spelling Cards for each sound.


- Tell students that _hard_ is a homonym; it is a word that has multiple meanings
but is spelled and pronounced the same.


- Ask: What does _hard_ mean in this sentence: “The chair was hard, so I put a
pillow on the seat”? _(not soft; firm)_


- Ask: What does _hard_ mean in this sentence: “The math text was not hard; I
think I got all the answers correct”? _(difficult)_


- Tell students that they will also see the word _hardship_ in today’s section
of _Campfire Tales_ . Display the word _hardship_ on the board and divide the
syllables: hard/ship. Define _hardship_ as a situation or experience that is
difficult to deal with or manage.


- Display the Tricky Words _drought,_ _solution_, and _baobab_ . Read each word, and
use it aloud in a sentence.


- Point out which parts of each word are regular and can be blended as you
would expect and which parts are not regular and will either be taught later
or simply must be remembered.


  - Tricky Word: _drought_


   - Expected: /d/, /r/, /ou/, /t/


   - Tricky: The letters gh are silent.


  - Tricky Word: _solution_


   - Expected: /s/,/l/, /tion/


   - Tricky: The letter ‘o’ is pronounced /ə/; the letter ‘u’ is pronounced
/oo/.


  - Tricky Word: _baobab_


   - Expected: /b/, /a/


   - Tricky: The letters ‘ao’ are pronounced /ae/ /o/.


- Invite students to share with a turn-and-talk partner what they already know
about the meanings of these words. Encourage students to maintain eye
contact while speaking coherently about these words from the Reader.

 - Guide the class in reading Chapter 3, pages 24–31. There are fifteen
paragraphs in this section. Assign each paragraph to two students who will
chorally read their assigned paragraph aloud while their peers follow along.
Some students may be assigned multiple paragraphs.


 - Have students mark the high-frequency word _hard_ in the text as they read.
Students might also identify previous high-frequency words also present in
this section of the Reader: _tree_, _story_, _thought_ .


 - Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension as well as to check for
students’ ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or
multiple-meaning words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant
questions to clarify any information from the text or prompts. Example
prompts include:


   - **Literal.** Why does Sadie’s grandfather tell her this story? _(He wants her_
_to go to sleep.)_


   - **Evaluative.** Why are Kwame’s family and friends suffering? _(There was a_
_drought. The plants withered and died.)_


   - **Inferential.** In the third paragraph, what does the word _resign_ mean?
Where can you look for the definition? _(to accept something bad that_
_can’t be changed; “he decided to find a solution no matter what”)_


   - **Literal.** What does Kwame do to help bring water to the land? _(He brings_
_the animals together to dig wells deep into the ground.)_


   - **Evaluative.** What are the qualities of a leader based on what Asha
described in the text? _(hard worker, determined)_


 - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses.


 - As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record. Record notes about
mispronunciations, self-correction, pacing, transposition of words, and
expression.


~~**PRACTICE WITH ENCODE AND APPLY (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students open to Activity Page 8.2. Read aloud the directions. Clarify
that students will complete each of the words with the digraph _kn_ or _gn_ .

~~**INTRODUCE COMMON TRIGRAPHS: IGH, EAR (DEAR), EER, ERE(HERE), ORE (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Display Consonant Trigraphs: _igh_, _ear_, _eer_, _ere_, _ore_ .


  - Explain these spellings as trigraphs (three letters that combine to make a
single sound).


  - Focusing on one spelling at a time, point to the spelling as you say it aloud,
and have students repeat the sound in unison. Then, read the examples while
underlining the trigraph spelling, stretching out the vowel sound to help
students hear that it is a long vowel sound (/ie/ for _igh_, /ee/ for _ear_ and _eer_,
and /or/ for _ore_ ).


  - Have students repeat the words read aloud and clap the syllables.


  - Point out that these are not the only spellings for the sounds, nor the only
sounds that these spellings can make. Remind students that oftentimes
there is more than one way to spell a sound. Ensure they understand that
today they will read, spell, and identify words with these specific sound
spellings.


  - Point out that there are no rules that show when to use the different sound
spellings, and that this can be difficult when the trigraphs sound the same,
such as _ear_, _eer_, and _ere_ . Explain that students will review a variety of words
that use the trigraphs _igh_, _ear_, _eer_, _ere_, and _ore_ so that they can become
familiar with them and apply them in their own writing.


  - Draw a table with a column for each trigraph on the board/chart paper.


  - Say the word _nearby_ aloud. Prompt students to turn and talk to identify the
trigraph used in the word.


  - Ask a student volunteer to share the spelling of the word, then write the
correct spelling on the board/chart paper in the ear column.


  - Repeat the process with the words _insight_, _cheerful_, _adhere_ and _ignore_ .

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


The four consonant trigraphs that students will learn in this lesson are
examples of r-controlled vowels. Although students have learned about
r-controlled syllables in Grade 2, they might not immediately recall this
type of syllable or the idea that the ‘r’ controls the sound the vowel before it
makes. Therefore, in this lesson, it is simply pointed out that these trigraphs
rhyme. Students will explore r-controlled syllables in depth in Unit 5.


**Foundational Skills**

) **Digital Component 10.1**


 - Prepare an enlarged version of Consonant Trigraphs: _ear_, _ere_, _air_, _are_


**Reading**

 - Preview the section of the Reader that will be read during this lesson.
Consider using sticky notes to mark this section to easily find vocabulary
terms: _caulk_ . Display vocabulary on the board for students to decode.


**Universal Access**

 - Use the images prepared in advance as you preview the Tricky Words
( _neighbors_, _flooded_ ) to provide visual support for the words and their
meanings. These visual supports make text more comprehensible for
all learners, and accessible for learners who would have difficulty with
comprehension when only provided in a written and/or verbal format.

 - Display Consonant Trigraphs: _ear_, _ere_, _air_, _are_ .


 - Remind students that these spellings are trigraphs (three letters that
combine to make a single sound).


 - Focus on one trigraph at a time, say it aloud, and have students repeat the
sound in unison. Then, read the examples while underlining the trigraph.


   - Point out the two spellings that are the same as the two that they learned
in the previous lesson ( _ear_ and _eer_ ). Emphasize the differences in the
sounds they represent in today’s lesson. Note the word _tearing_ and
explain that both pronunciations are words. Emphasize to students that
understanding the context is crucial when deciding how to pronounce
spellings with multiple sound patterns.


 - Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share: What do you notice about these four
trigraphs and the sounds that they represent? Provide sentence frames for
student responses: They all __________. The sound is _______. _(They all make_
_the same sound. The sound is /air/.)_


 - Circle the keywords _bear_, _there_, _pair_, and _square_ on Consonant Trigraphs:
_ear_, _ere_, _air_, _are_ . Ask students to echo as you read each word.


 - Explain that these keywords can help us when we have multiple spelling
patterns for one sound.


 - Tell students that the most frequently used spelling for /air/ is _air_ . Write
a number 1 next to the _air_ trigraph. Explain that this spelling is most often
found in words that are nouns.


 - Have students repeat the words read aloud and clap the syllables.


 - Remind students that often there is more than one way to spell a sound, and
that these are not the only sounds represented by these spellings. Ensure
they understand that today they will read, spell, and identify words with these
specific sound spellings.

their spellings. Explain that students will read each sentence and circle the
words that contain the /air/ sound. Then they will write the words under the
keyword for each spelling. Remind students to write neatly in cursive.


 - Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share: What do you notice about the spellings
of the words in each list? Provide sentence frames for student responses:
Most of the words are spelled with ____. The fewest words are spelled with
____. _(Most of the words are spelled with_ air _. The fewest words are spelled_
_with_ ere _.)_


 - Direct students’ attention to Part 2.

  - Instruct students to read the assigned section of the Reader, ending on page
39.


  - As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record. Record notes about
mispronunciations, self-correction, pacing, transposition of words, and
expression.


  - Model how to use the Glossary in the Reader to discover the pronunciation
and definition of words in bold. Review the definition together and ask
students to share their understanding of the word. Call on a few students to
share their thinking.


  - Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension, as well as to check for
students’ ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or
multiple-meaning words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant
questions to clarify any information from the text or prompts. Example
prompts include:


    - **Inferential.** Why are Arjun’s parents puzzled? What in the text makes
you say this? _(Arjun was very distracted. The text says, "Even when_
_they asked him to help with an easy task, they knew it would not get_
_done.")_


    - **Literal.** What does Arjun’s mom ask him to do? _(Fix a leak.)_


    - **Evaluative.** What is the effect of Arjun’s distraction and carelessness?
_(The small leak grew into a large crack, and the burst pipe flooded the_
_entire house.)_


    - **Inferential.** How do the characters feel about daydreaming? _(Answers_
_may vary but may include that there is nothing wrong with_
_daydreaming as long as you take care of your work and take_
_responsibility for your actions.)_


  - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses.
Provide the following sentence stems for students to use: In the beginning,


    - Luna was . . .


    - Luna feels . . .


    - when the sun is setting, Luna finds here way out of the forest by . . .


    - Selfless means . . .

**Primary Focus:** Students will read and spell multisyllabic words with closed
syllables.


~~**TEKS 3.2.A.ii; TEKS 3.2.B.i; TEKS 3.2.D**~~


~~**REVIEW CLOSED SYLLABLES (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that words can be broken into parts called syllables. A
syllable has one, and only one, vowel sound. All vowels cause the mouth to
open. So, if a word has a vowel, our mouth opens to say the vowel sound in
the word. For example, the word _cat_ is one syllable long. The short /a/ sound
causes the mouth to open in the middle of the word. A word has as many
syllables as it has sounded vowels. For example, a word with one vowel sound
has one syllable, and a word with two vowel sounds has two syllables.


  - Demonstrate the opening of the mouth for vowel sounds with a two-syllable
word: _hotdog_ .


  - Tell students that today they will read multisyllabic words (words with
multiple syllables) with closed syllables. A closed syllable is a syllable with
a single short vowel sound before a consonant or consonant digraph (or
“closed in”).


  - Students should read the words by blending the sounds in the first syllable,
then blending the sounds in the second syllable, and then putting the two
syllables together.


  - Write the word _mascot_ on the board in cursive, modeling proper letter
formation.


  - Ask students to sound out the word by first blending the sounds in the first
syllable (/m/ /a/ /s/: mas), then blending the sounds in the second syllable
(/k/ /o/ /t/: cot), and then putting the two syllables together ( _mascot_ ).


  - Add a visual and kinesthetic element to this activity by having students hold
up one finger on their right hand for each phonene in _mas_ and one finger on
their left hand for each phoneme in _cot_ . Then move their hands together as
they say _mascot_ .


**TEKS 3.2.A.ii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open

Challenge


Provide students with index
cards containing closed
syllable parts, such as _pic_,
_nic_, _bob_, _cat_, _rus_, _set_, _bas_,
_ket_, _Den, ton,_ _den_, _tist_ . Have
students mix and match
these closed syllable parts
to form actual multisyllabic
words. Then have them
form nonsense words
from the closed syllable
parts and decide what the
meaning of each nonsense
could be based on its parts.
Using the story from the
reader, have students draw
pictures to sequence the
events in the story.


**126**




 - Tell students that the syllables in _mascot_ are both closed syllables. In the
word _mascot_, the consonants ‘s’ and ‘t’ close the vowel in and mark the end
of the syllable. Students can identify consonants or consonant digraphs after
a short vowel sound to know where the syllable ends.


 - Repeat this process with the words _napkin, publish, attic, limited, magnet,_
and _sunset_ .


 - Prompt students to turn and talk to share what they noticed about closed
syllables and how merging them helps to read multisyllabic words.


 - Invite students to share what their partner said with the class.


~~**PRACTICE WITH DICTATION (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students open to Activity Page 11.1.


 - Explain that they will listen as you say each word once, and then listen again
and write the words _comic, ashes, public, plastic,_ and _fantastic._


 - Remind students to write words in cursive.


 - Direct students’ attention to the lines at the bottom of the activity page.
Dictate the following sentence: The children expected food at the picnic.


 - Slowly repeat the sentence twice. Direct students to complete responses in
cursive, leaving space between words.


 - Circulate and monitor, providing corrective feedback for proper letter
formation as needed. Offer feedback such as:


   - “Remember to keep your letters consistently sized. Try making your ‘l’ a
bit taller to match the height of your other letters.”


   - “Focus on connecting your letters smoothly. Work on making the
transition from ‘t’ to ‘i’ more fluid.”


 - At the end, reread each word and the sentence once more.

  - Remind students that words can be broken into parts called syllables.
Have students turn to a partner and share a multisyllabic word and how its
syllables are divided. A syllable has one, and only one, sounded vowel. All
vowels cause the mouth to open. So, if a word has a vowel, our mouth opens
to say the vowel sound in the word. A word has as many syllables as it has
sounded vowels. For example, the word _rabbit_ has two vowel sounds and two
syllables.


  - Emphasize the number of vowel sounds, not the number of vowels, and
remind students that sometimes one vowel sound is spelled with more than
one vowel.


  - Reiterate that a multisyllabic word can be more easily read by first dividing it
into its parts.


  - Tell students that they will first divide multisyllabic words using a vowelconsonant-consonant-vowel syllabication pattern.


  - Explain that this pattern is one of several patterns that show a reader where
to divide a word into its syllables.


  - Point students to the word _expect_ on the board. Model and think aloud the
following:


    - Label the vowels first by writing the letter ‘V’ under the vowels in the
word (the ‘e’s in this example).


    - Label the consonants between the vowels by writing the letter ‘C’ under
the consonants in the word (the ‘x’ and ‘p’ in this example).


    - Demonstrate the correct syllabication of this word by drawing a slash
through the middle of the consonants (the letters ‘x’ and ‘p’).

Then, have them put the
cards into piles based on
how many syllables each
word has.


**Intermediate**
In small groups, have
students sit in a circle.
Ask the first student to
say a word that has one
syllable. The next student
should say a word with
two syllables, and so on.
Students continue the
chain, ensuring each word
matches the required
syllable count. When
students cannot make any
more words, start over with
a one syllable word.


**Advanced/Advanced High**
Provide a printed list of
multisyllabic words with

Incorporate clapping if
students are struggling

**136**




- Explain that once you know what each syllable is, you can easily decode
them, combine the syllables, and read. Model decoding and recoding _expect_
syllable at a time (ex/pect).


- Model this process with the other two words on the board: _burden_ and
_support_ .


- Direct students to turn and talk: What is different about the way _burden_ and
_support_ are said? (The first syllable of _burden_ is emphasized, but the second
syllable of _support_ is emphasized.)


- Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share what they think a stressed and
unstressed syllable might be using what they observed about _burden_ and
_support_ .


- Define stressed syllables as part of the word that is emphasized or given
“special attention.” They might sound different because our voice gets louder
or higher. The other parts of the word are unstressed syllables. They don’t get
as much attention and don’t sound as loud or high.


  - Note: _Accented_ syllable is another term for _stressed syllable_ .


- Point to the word _burden_ and say it out loud. Exaggerate different parts of the
word to illustrate stressed and unstressed syllables. For example, say _BUR-_
_den_ with emphasis on the first syllable and then _bur-DEN_ with emphasis on
the second syllable. Point out how the correct pronunciation of the word puts
stress on the first syllable.


- Contrast this example by similarly exaggerating the second syllable of
_support_ (sup-PORT).


- Circle the stressed syllables for each of the three words on the board.


- Say aloud three additional words for students to practice orally: _bottom_,
_tunnel_, and _insisted_ . For each, have students turn to an elbow partner to
determine first the number of syllables and then which syllable in the word is
stressed.


  - Note for the word _bottom_ : Point out how the vowel sound in the
unstressed syllable of words sometimes changes from a short sound to
a schwa sound (that can sound like a short /ŭ/ or /ĭ/ at times). Illustrate
this in the word _bottom_ by pronouncing it first with both short sounds
and then pronouncing it by changing the sound to a schwa sound.

~~**PLAY JUMP FOR THE STRESSED SYLLABLE (8 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students open to Activity Page 12.1.


 - Read aloud the rule at the top of the page for students: In the VC/CV
syllabication pattern, split the word between the two consonants between
the vowels.


 - Review the example (rab/bit), drawing attention to the VC/CV labels and
where the syllables were split.


 - Direct students to the word boxes and ask them to identify the vowels in each
word and the consonants between the vowels and label them ‘V’ and ‘C’.


 - Ask students to draw lines in each word to divide the syllables between the
consonants (VC/CV), and have students write each syllable in cursive in the
space below the word.


 - Depending on students’ abilities, have them complete the rest of the words
independently or with a partner.


 - Circulate and monitor students’ cursive writing, providing feedback for
proper letter formation as needed. Offer feedback such as:


   - “You’re doing well with your cursive! Pay attention to the slant of your
letters. Try to keep them all at the same angle.”


   - “Check the spacing between your words. Make sure there’s enough room
between each word to maintain readability.”


 - Separate the class into three groups. Label the groups 1, 2, and 3. Explain
that each group matches each syllable in the words on Activity Page 12.1.
Direct students to crouch down and jump up if their syllable is stressed in the
word said aloud. For example, for the word _custom_, group 1 would jump up,
and groups 2 and 3 would remain crouched.


 - Read aloud each word on Activity Page 12.1 one at a time _(custom, upset,_
_afternoon, basketball)_ . Speak slowly enough for students to have time to
react.


 - Give students time to circle the stressed syllable after the activity.


 - Focus students on the final word box on Activity Page 12.1. Have them work
independently to write a new word in the top space that follows the VCCV
pattern. Note that students should choose a word that is two or three
syllables.


 - Prompt students to again label the word with VCCV and draw slashes. Have
them rewrite the syllables in the middle section of the word box and circle the
stressed syllable.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


In this lesson, we will delve into the VCV (vowel-consonant-vowel) syllable
division pattern, with a primary focus on the split that occurs after a closed
syllable (VC/V). We will explore how recognizing and understanding this
pattern aids students in decoding and spelling words with confidence. As you
progress through Unit 2, our focus will shift towards open syllables and the
split that occurs after the vowel, providing a comprehensive understanding
of syllable division in various contexts.


**Foundational Skills**

) **Digital Component 13.1**


 - Create an enlarged version of VC/V Syllable Pattern, or prepare to display the
digital version.


**Reading**

 - Preview the section of the Reader that will be read during this lesson.
Consider using sticky notes to mark he high-frequency words: _near_ .


 - Utilize data to intentionally predetermine reading partners. Consider utilizing
the following documents to track and record student progress:


   - Grade 3 Fluency Record


   - Partner Reading Feedback (Unit 1, Lesson 9)


   - Anecdotal Reading Record


**Universal Access**

 - Students may benefit from physically cutting up words with a closed first
syllable to see where the division split belongs in these VC/V words used in
this lesson.


 - Before the lesson, it may benefit students to review closed syllable types and
quickly state short vowel sounds. You may also use multimedia, such as a
song or video, to quickly review these concepts.


 - Prepare a recorded list of words for students to listen to and a chart with
three columns: one-syllable, two-syllable, and three-syllable words.


 - Prepare a list of words with different amounts of syllables and VC/V syllables.

**Primary Focus:** Students will read and spell words that follow a VCV syllable
division pattern with accent shifts.


~~**TEKS 3.2.A.iv; TEKS 3.2.B.v; TEKS 3.2.D**~~


~~**INTRODUCE VC/V SYLLABLE DIVISION (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that words can be broken into parts called syllables. A
syllable has one, and only one, sounded vowel. All vowels cause the mouth
to open. So, if a word has a vowel, our mouth opens to say the vowel sound
in the word. A word has as many syllables as it has sounded vowels. For
example, the word _finish_ has two vowel sounds and two syllables.


  - Remind students of the previous syllabication pattern they learned:
VCCV and closed syllables. Closed syllables always end in a consonant or
consonant digraph to close in the short vowel sound. This understanding is
crucial for knowing where to separate the syllables in this lesson’s words.


  - Ask: “Why is it helpful to recognize the syllable division pattern in
multisyllabic words?”


  - Have students turn and talk to discuss possible responses to this question
and then call on a student to share what their partner discussed. Provide a
sentence stem for support: My partner said recognizing the syllable division
pattern is helpful because. . . _(it can help us read the word correctly)_


  - Display VC/V Syllable Pattern. Invite student volunteers to read the rules
aloud.


  - Demonstrate the VC/V syllable rules using the word _punish_ .

   - Label the vowels first by writing the letter ‘V’ under the vowels in _punish_
(the letters ‘u’ and ‘i’).


   - Label the consonant between the vowels by writing the letter ‘C’ under
the consonants in _punish_ (the letter ‘n’).


   - Demonstrate the correct syllabication of this word by drawing a slash
after the ‘n’.


   - Model the accurate pronunciation of this word based on this syllabication
pattern.


 - Invite six students to stand up in the front of the room.


 - Explain that each student will represent one letter in the word _punish_ . Align
the students in the order of the word. As you say each letter, ask the assigned
student to create either a V or a C with their arms to indicate if the letter they
are representing is a vowel or a consonant.


 - As students hold their positions, invite another student to represent the
slash that shows where the syllable division should occur. Invite this student
to stand in the correct spot, leaning slightly at an angle like a slash.


 - Point out the VC/V pattern that the students have created with their bodies.


 - Repeat this process with new student volunteers for each of the following

  - Choose strategic prompts to check for comprehension and for students’
ability to use to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or
multiple-meaning words. Have students listen actively, speak coherently, and
ask relevant questions to clarify any information from the text or prompts.
Example prompts include:


    - **Literal.** What happened to Asha’s older sister, and how did Asha react?
_(Her sister fell and hurt herself, but she didn’t stop playing to ask if she_
_was okay.)_


    - **Literal.** What was on the other side of the little river? _(a dock where_
_people would catch fish)_


    - **Inferential.** In the first paragraph of the last page we read, what does
the word _currents_ mean? What parts of the text help you to know that?
_(Current means the speed of the water. Answers may vary but could_
_include being too close to the waterfall, being thrown out of the water.)_


    - **Literal.** Why did Mei stay in her corner instead of swimming to the other
side of the waterfall? _(She was afraid that she would be thrown out of the_
_water and onto a rock.)_


    - **Inferential.** Do you think Mei will continue to stay in her corner of the
river? Why or why not? _(Answers may vary.)_


  - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses.

~~**INTRODUCE VCCCV SYLLABLE DIVISION AND ACCENT SHIFTS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Begin the lesson by collecting information about what students have learned
so far in this unit. Ask the following questions, using a combination of Turnand-Talk, Think-Pair-Share, and Call and Response:


    - What is a syllable? _(A syllable is a word part that contains one vowel_
_sound.)_


    - Does a vowel sound always have a single written vowel? _(No, sometimes_
_more than one vowel is written for a single sound.)_


    - What does it mean when a syllable is stressed? _(It’s a part of the word_
_that has more emphasis, or is given more attention.)_


    - What is a digraph, and which have we reviewed so far? _(A digraph_
_contains two letters that make one sound. We have learned_ wh _,_ th _,_ ch _,_ sh _,_
ng _,_ nk _,_ ck _,_ dge _,_ ge _,_ ph _,_ gh _,_ kn _, and_ gn _.)_


    - What is a trigraph, and which have we reviewed so far? _(A trigraph_
_contains three letters that make one sound. We have learned_ tch _,_ dge _,_ ear _,_
ere _,_ air _,_ are _,_ igh _,_ eer _, and_ ore _.)_


    - What are consonant blends, and which have you learned previously?
_(Blends are made up of the letters for two or three consonant sounds in a_
_cluster before or after a vowel sound within a syllable. We can hear each_
_consonant sound in a blend. Examples include_ st _,_ dr _,_ tr _, and_ fl _.)_


  - Explain to students that everything they have reviewed and learned so far will
be applied to this last syllable division pattern. Explain that knowing syllable
division patterns helps to break down longer words into smaller, easy-to-read
parts.


  - Display VCCCV Syllable Pattern (Digital Component 14.1).


**TEKS 3.1.B** Follow, restate, and give oral instructions that involve a series of related sequences of actions; **TEKS 3.2.A.iv**

 - Invite student volunteers to read the rule and the steps to syllabicate aloud.


 - Have students restate the rules and steps to a turn-and-talk partner.


 - Point to the two words that have already been marked _(hundred_ and
_kingdom)_ and draw attention to the fact that the blend/digraph remains a
unit when you split the syllables.


 - Model the accurate pronunciation of the words based on the syllabication
pattern. Note: For the word _kingdom_, illustrate shifting the short /o/ sound
to a schwa sound for correct pronunciation. Verify that the schwa is in the
unstressed syllable for students.


 - Display the second chart of words in Digital Component 14.2 VCCCV Syllable
Pattern.


 - Invite seven students to stand up in the front of the room. Assign each
student one letter in the word _kitchen_ . Align the students in the order of the
word. As you say each letter, ask the assigned student to create either a ‘V’ or
a ‘C’ with their arms to indicate if their letter is a vowel or a consonant.


 - As students hold their positions, ask a student to identify any digraphs/blend
_(ch)_ . Ask the students representing letters ‘ _c_ ’ and ‘ _h_ ’ to hold their hand in an
“air high-five” to illustrate that these letters do not separate.


 - Invite another student to represent the slash that shows where the syllable
division should occur. Invite this student to stand in the correct spot, leaning
slightly at an angle like a slash.


 - Point out the VCCCV pattern that the students have created with their
bodies.


 - Repeat this process with new student volunteers for each of the following
words from the chart: _mushroom_, _children_, and _pumpkin_ .


~~**PLAY ROLL, FLIP, READ, WRITE (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Move students into pairs. Provide each pair with a die and provide each
student with their own set of Roll, Flip, Read, Write Word Cards numbered
from 1 to 6 on the back.


 - Have students open to Activity Page 14.1. The Roll, Flip, Read, Write Word
Cards words on page TR 14.2 in the Teacher Resources include: _control_,
_instant_, _photograph_, _sandwich_, _grassland_, _reckless_ .


Foundational Skills 1


 - Review the game directions:


   - Have students lay cards facedown on the table or floor in front of them,
careful to keep their cards separate from their partner’s cards.


   - To play, have Student A roll a die and then pick up the card corresponding
to the number rolled and read the word on the card aloud to their partner,
without showing their partner the card.


   - Student B writes the word in the column they think it goes in using their
understanding of VCCCV syllabication rules.


   - Student A reveals the card and Student B corrects their word placement
or spelling, as needed.


   - Play continues until all words have been revealed. Encourage students
to discuss and justify their reason for writing the word in the chosen
column.


   - Remind students to write words in cursive, leaving space between words.


 - Circulate and monitor student writing, providing feedback for proper letter
formation. Offer feedback such as:


   - “Check that your loops and tails are formed smoothly and connect to the
next letter.”


   - “Remember to keep your letters consistently sized. Try making your ‘b’ a
bit taller to match the height of your other letters.”


 - Focus students on the line below the chart. Explain that you will read aloud a
sentence. Students will write the sentence, identify two multisyllabic words
that follow the VCCCV pattern, and draw a slash to split the syllables in those
words.


 - Dictate the following sentence: The sandbox was farther than the swings.


 - Repeat slowly, stretching out the sounds.

expression.


- Pair students with intentional reading partners.


- Tell students that they will partner-read the rest of Chapter 6.


- Model partner reading with a student volunteer, alternating reading
sentences and providing assistance to each other as needed.


Foundational Skills 1


  - Choose strategic prompts to check for comprehension, as well as to check
for students’ ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar
or multiple-meaning words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant
questions to clarify any information from the text or prompts. Example
prompts include:


    - **Literal.** Why was Mei shocked when Li told her there were more fish like
them on the other side of the waterfall? _(She thought she was the only_
_fish like herself in the entire river.)_


    - **Evaluative.** How did Mei show her bravery in the river? _(She swam_
_through the current and the waterfall.)_


    - **Evaluative.** Where in the text does a character show encouragement?
_(Answers may vary but could include that Li shouts “Come on, you can do_
_it!” when Mei swims across the river.)_


    - **Literal.** According to Winnie, what takes bravery to do? _(to share a story_
_that is important to you)_


    - **Inferential.** What are some lessons that the characters’ stories taught?
_(sharing, listening, treating others with respect)_


  - Ensure students speak coherently about the Reader and draw evidence from
the text to support their responses. Provide the following sentence stems for
students to use:


    - Mei was shocked because . . .


    - Mei showed bravery by . . .


    - Encouragement is shown when . . .


    - Winnie says it takes bravery to . . .


    - Some lessons the stories taught are . . .


  - Circulate to listen to as many partner pairs as possible. As you listen
to students read _Campfire Tales_, make notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record. Record notes about
mispronunciations, self-correction, pacing, transposition of words, and ability
to decode multisyllabic words.

Today, you will begin the multi-part assessment. In the first part, you’ll
conduct one-on-one Fluency Assessments with each student. Meanwhile,
students will participate in review activities (Roll, Flip, Read, Write and selfsustained reading) while awaiting their turn for the assessment. To manage
time effectively, consider rotating students between the review activities
provided. You will most likely need more than one day to test each student;
you may plan on using time during the following lesson to complete the
Fluency Assessment.


You may also use Pausing Point days to administer the optional Word
Reading in Isolation Assessment designed to assess a student’s ability to
read words containing the spellings that were taught and reviewed in this
unit. The emphasis in this assessment is solely on decoding accuracy. It
would be ideal to assess all students using the Word Reading in Isolation
Assessment, but if there is a time restriction, assess only students who score
below the 50th percentile on the Fluency Assessment. Keep in mind that a
single word will target multiple letter-sounds.


The second part of the assessment takes place in the following lesson. It is a
reading and spelling exercise targeting each of the skills taught in Unit 1.


**Foundational Skills**

 - Prepare student pairings to work together to play Roll, Flip, Read, Write.


 - Create a set of Roll, Flip, Read, Write Word Cards for each student. Write a
number (1–10) on the reverse side of each card.


**Reading**

 - Gather books of varying complexity for students to choose from during selfsustained reading.


 - Provide the Self-Sustained Reading Tracker (TR 15.4) to students during selfsustained reading to keep track of the books they read.


**Universal Access**

 - During the Roll, Flip, Read, Write activity, consider collaboratively pairing
students with varying reading levels to provide opportunities for them to hear
words their peers model correctly in a collaborative group.


 - Identify which students may benefit from different word cards during the
Roll, Flip, Read, Write activity. Utilize Roll, Flip, Read Write Word Cards
(optional) and Activity Page 15.2 for this activity.


Foundational Skills 1


- Provide books of varying complexity for students to choose from during selfsustained reading. Consider both quantitative and qualitative factors when
selecting book options. Offer a variety of genres. Encourage students to explore
any books that interest them regardless of their reading level.

**Primary Focus:** Students will read aloud with appropriate accuracy, rate, and
expression. ~~**TEKS 3.4**~~


~~**FLUENCY ASSESSMENT**~~


You will work individually with each student and take a running record
of the student’s oral reading of a text. For this assessment, you will take
a simple, easily calculated measure of the student’s fluency by seeing
how long it takes the student to read the text. Allow each student three
minutes to read the story. Students with proficient fluency should be able to
complete the text in this amount of time. Instruct students to complete the
comprehension questions after reading the text.


  - Have one student at a time come to a quiet assessment area to read “The
Baseball Game” with you.


  - Ask the student for Activity Page 15.3 (Fluency Assessment) and Activity
Page 15.4 (Fluency Assessment Questions).


  - Tell the student that you are going to ask him or her to read the story aloud.


  - Explain that you are going to use a watch (or a stopwatch) to see how long it
takes the student to read the story. Tell the student that this is not a race; he
or she should read at their regular pace and not rush.


  - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the title. If you are
using a watch, write the exact Start Time, in minutes and seconds, on your
record page.


  - If you are using a stopwatch, you do not need to write down the start time
since the stopwatch will calculate the Elapsed Time.


  - As the student reads the story, make a running record on a copy of the text
using the following guidelines:


**TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text.

- When the student finishes reading the story, write the exact Finish Time in minutes
and seconds on your record sheet.


- Alternatively, if you are using a stopwatch, simply write down the Elapsed Time in
minutes and seconds.


- If the student reads very slowly, you may need to stop the reading before the
student gets to the end of the story. (Five minutes should be enough time to get
a measurement.) If the student does not read to the end, draw a vertical line on
the record sheet to indicate how far the student read. Also, write down either the
Finish Time or the Elapsed Time.


- Repeat this process for each student.


Activity Page 15.3: Fluency Assessment


- If the reading was fairly accurate (<10 uncorrected errors), you can get a rough
(and easy) estimate of a student’s W.C.P.M. score by simply noting the time and
looking at the chart on the Unit 1 W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


- Calculate each student’s exact W.C.P.M. score using the following steps:


  - First, complete the Words section of the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet (TR 15.3).


  - Count Words Read. This is the total number of words that the student read or
attempted to read, up to the point where they stopped. It includes words that
the student read correctly, as well as words that the student read incorrectly
or skipped over. If the student attempted to read the whole story, including the
title, use 253 words as your total. If the student did not finish the story, you
will need to count the number of words that the student actually attempted
to read. Write the count for Words Read in the matching box on the W.C.P.M.
Calculation Sheet.


  - Count the Uncorrected Mistakes noted in your running record. This includes
words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and words that you had to


Foundational Skills 1


supply. Write the total in the box labeled Uncorrected Mistakes. A mistake
corrected by the student is not counted as one; the student is penalized for
the time they lost making the correction, but not for the initial mistake.


  - Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get the Words Correct.


  - Next, complete the Time section of the activity page.


  - Calculate the Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a
stopwatch, this should already be done for you. Skip to the next step.)
If you used a watch and recorded start and stop times, you will need to
subtract the Start Time from the Finish Time to calculate the Elapsed Time.
Subtract seconds from seconds then minutes from minutes. Calculate
Time in Seconds. Multiply the number of minutes by 60 to convert minutes
to seconds, and then add the number of seconds.


  - Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then multiply by 60 to get
Words Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.).


- As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider:


  - It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.
scores. However, a major goal for Grade 3 students is to read with
sufficient fluency to ensure comprehension and independent reading of
school assignments in subsequent grades. Exact fluency targets vary from
state to state; the national mean calculated by Hasbrouck and Tindal in
2017 for Fall of Grade 3 is 83 W.C.P.M.


  - A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared with the score of other
students in the classroom (or grade level) and also with the national
fluency norms for the Fall of Grade 3 obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal.
Students whose scores are below the 25th percentile (59 W.C.P.M) are
experiencing serious problems in reading fluently.


- Compare the student’s W.C.P.M. score to national norms for the Fall of
Grade 3 (Hasbrouck and Tindal, 2017):







|Reading Time<br>for this Text|W.C.P.M.|National Percentiles<br>for Fall, Grade 3|
|---|---|---|
|2:35|134|90th|
|3:05|104|75th|
|4:05|83|50th|
|5:55|59|25th|
|8:00|40|10th|



  - After you have entered each student’s scores on the Unit 1 W.C.P.M. Calculation
Sheet, record them on the Grade 3 End-of-Year Summary for each student.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today, students will complete the multi-part assessment. The Reading
& Spelling portion of the assessment takes place during the first twenty
minutes of this lesson. Once students have completed the assessment, they
will have time for quiet recreational reading. Use time in this lesson to finish
working with students who did not complete the Fluency Assessment in the
previous lesson.


You may also use Pausing Point days to administer the optional Tricky Word
Assessment included in Teacher Resources to specific students that you
suspect may not have thoroughly mastered the Tricky Words and highfrequency words reviewed in this unit.


**Foundational Skills**

 - Provide colored pencils for students to use when checking and correcting
their spelling on Activity Page 16.1.


 - As needed, prepare a copy of the optional Unit 1 Tricky Word Assessment (TR
16.3) and the Unit 1 Tricky Word Assessment Analysis (TR 16.4).


**Reading**

 - Consider preparing games used in previous lessons in this unit for review to
be available as an optional activity after assessments.


 - Gather books of varying complexity for students to choose from during selfsustained reading time.


 - Provide the Self-Sustained Reading Tracker (TR 15.4) to students during selfsustained reading to keep track of the books they read.


**Universal Access**

 - Provide audiobooks or books in students’ home languages as options for
recreational reading.


 - To gain additional information about students’ mastery of unit skills, provide
targeted Place Activity Page 16.1 in front of the student and have them
read the line(s) with the error(s). Then, ask the student to point at and
read the correct word for that line. The student’s oral response will indicate
whether the mistake was a careless error or if the student needs additional
instruction in specific letter-sound correspondences. If the student makes
more than six uncorrected mistakes, they are having problems with word
recognition and may need more practice decoding specific spellings. Utilize
the Pausing Point to provide customized support for these students.


Foundational Skills 1


- Challenge students to apply syllabication rules and draw lines between the
syllables of each word on the Reading Assessment.


- Encourage students to write book reviews of their independent reading texts.
This can be done through writing or recording their thoughts on these texts
and making recommendations for their classmates.


- Invite students to craft a different ending for one of their texts. Encourage
them to use multisyllabic words containing the digraphs and trigraphs
covered in this unit as they write.


- Prepare a graphic organizer that includes sections for the word’s definition,
an example of its usage, and an illustration to enhance understanding.

**Two-Syllable Baseball**

 - Divide the class into two teams. Have one team at a time come to the front of
the room in front of the Two-Syllable Baseball Game Board and line up.


 - To play, teams take turns “at bat”:


   - Pick a card from the pile (Two-Syllable Baseball Word Cards) and ask the
first person on the team to read it.


   - If the underlined word in the sentence is read correctly, draw a line from
home plate to first base, signifying a “hit.” This player should go to the
back of his or her team’s line while the next player comes forward to read
the next card. If the second player reads the word correctly, draw a line
from first to second base.


   - Play continues in this way, so that each time a player reads the
underlined word in the sentence correctly, you draw a line to the next
base. If the fourth player reads the underlined word in the sentence
correctly, draw a line from third base to home plate and mark “1 run” for
this team.


   - Play continues for the members of this team so long as no words are
misread. When a word is misread, the next team takes its turn at bat.


   - As in the actual game of baseball, any players “left on base” when a word
is misread do not count or add to the score.


~~**MORE HELP WITH SYLLABICATION**~~


**Speak and Spell**

 - Have students open to Activity Page PP.1.


 - Explain that for all activities, students are expected to write in cursive.
Additionally, when writing sentences, they need to leave spaces between
words.


 - Model the Speak and Spell activity.


 - Instruct students to listen as you say a word, listening carefully for the
syllables and sounds.


 - Say aloud the word on the first card for students to hear: _magnetic_ .


 - Hold up the card to display the word.


 - Repeat the word _magnetic_ . Orally chunk the syllables.


 - Instruct students to say the word aloud and clap the syllables as they say it.


Foundational Skills 1


  - Demonstrate on the board how to syllabicate (label vowels and consonants
and put a slash between syllables) and move the word parts to their
appropriate syllable boxes on the activity sheet.


  - Instruct students that they will do the same with each word they will hear.
They will write its syllables on their copies of Activity Page PP.1 after they
hear you say it and read it themselves, and then they will say the word and
clap the syllables themselves.


  - Repeat the process with each word.


**Note:** Use the following word box to extend the lesson.


**Note:** This activity can also be done independently. Provide a list of words on
the board for students to see and syllabicate on their own paper.

##### Grade 3 Fluency Record

Choose texts from the Grade 3 Fluency Packet or the Unit Readers for students to read aloud
as you measure their pace and accuracy. Subtract the Words Missed (words that are omitted,
mispronounced, or substituted for another word) from the Total Words in Text to determine the
number of Words Read Correctly. Divide the Words Read Correctly by the Total Words in Text to
determine the students’ accuracy. Record how long it takes the students to read the passage to
determine their Words Per Minute. Consider both accuracy and pace as well as expression when
evaluating a student’s overall fluency.

**Reading Assessment Scoring and Analysis**


The more words a student can read and the farther the
student can progress in the assessment, the stronger his or
her preparation for the next unit of instruction.


The number of words read correctly indicates the following:


  - Students who score 6 or fewer words out of 10 words
correctly have minimal preparation for the next unit.


  - Students who score 7 out of 10 words correctly have
adequate preparation for the next unit.


  - Students who score 8 or more words out of 10 words
correctly have outstanding preparation for the next
unit.


After scoring the assessment, you might find it helpful to
determine which phonemes students missed that caused
them to score below the benchmark for word recognition.

**Appendix A:**
#### Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program


~~**THE SIMPLE VIEW OF READING**~~


Virtually everyone who writes about reading now recognizes that reading comprehension requires
more than just decoding ability. Many reading researchers now subscribe to a view of reading that is
known as “the simple view of reading.” This view, which is associated with reading researchers Philip
Gough and William Tunmer, holds that there are two chief elements that are crucially important to
reading comprehension: decoding skills and language comprehension ability.


To achieve reading comprehension, a person needs to be able to decode the words on the page and
then make sense of those words. The first task is made possible by decoding skills and the second
by language comprehension ability. If the person cannot decode the words on the page, he or she
will not be able to achieve reading comprehension, no matter how much oral language he or she
can understand. Even if the person can decode the words on the page, that in and of itself is still no
guarantee of reading comprehension. Thus, if a person cannot understand sentences when they
hear them, they are unlikely to understand those sentences when reading.


Supporters of the simple view—and there are a growing number of them among reading
researchers—argue that a person’s reading comprehension ability can be predicted, with a high
degree of accuracy, based on two basic measures. The first is a measure of decoding skills (e.g.,
a test of single-word reading or pseudo-word reading). The second is a measure of listening
comprehension. Researchers who hold to the simple view say, “Tell me a person’s decoding ability,
as ascertained by a word-reading task, and tell me that person’s language comprehension ability,
as ascertained by a listening comprehension task, and I can make a very accurate prediction of
that person’s reading comprehension ability.” If the person is an efficient and accurate decoder and
also able to understand a wide range of oral language—for instance, classroom presentations, news
items on the radio or TV, books on tape, etc.—then it is a safe bet the person will also do well on
tests of reading comprehension.


An interesting thing about the simple view of reading is that it can be expressed as an equation:





In this equation, each of the letters is a variable that stands for a specific skill:


R is a measure of reading comprehension ability.



**264**



Foundational Skills 1


D is a measure of decoding skills.


C is a measure of language-comprehension ability as measured using a listening task.


Each of these skills can be quantified as a numerical value between 0 and 1, where 0 stands for no
ability whatsoever and 1 stands for perfect, not-to-be-improved-upon ability. Most people have a
skill level that falls somewhere between these two extremes.


The equation says that if you have some decoding ability (D > 0) and you also have some language
comprehension ability (C > 0), you will probably also have some reading comprehension ability (R >
0). How much reading comprehension ability you have will depend on the exact values of D and C.


What does it mean to have no decoding ability (D = 0)? It means you cannot turn printed words into
spoken words. A person who cannot decode letters on a page cannot read. The person is illiterate.


What does it mean to have no language comprehension ability (C = 0)? It means you do not know
the language, and you cannot understand any of it when you hear other people speaking or reading
aloud in that language.


It is not very common for a person to have decoding ability (D > 0) but not language comprehension
ability (C = 0). Why would you learn to read and write a language you cannot understand? It does
happen. One famous example involves the English poet John Milton, the author of _Paradise Lost_ and
other well-known poems. Milton went blind late in life. Since Braille had not yet been invented, this
meant he could not read for himself. Nevertheless, Milton found a way to keep learning from books:
he had friends and relatives read the books aloud for him. However, he was not always able to find
a scholar who had the free time and the ability needed to read to him in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and
other ancient languages. The solution? Milton taught his daughters to decode these languages so
they could read books in those languages aloud to him. Milton did not teach his daughters the actual
languages—the thousands of words and tens of thousands of meanings. That would have been a
difficult, time-consuming task. He only taught them the rules they would need to turn letters into
sounds. Thus, his daughters acquired solid decoding skills for these languages (D > 0), but they
would have scored a zero on any measure of language comprehension (C = 0). They could turn
symbols into sounds, but they had no idea what the sounds meant. Milton, on the other hand, due
to his blindness, had no functional decoding skills (D = 0). However, by virtue of his great learning,
he was able to understand Hebrew, Latin, and Greek when they were read aloud to him (C > 0).
Between Milton and his daughters, you might say, there was reading comprehension (R), but the
younger generation brought the decoding skills (D) and the elderly poet brought the language
comprehension (C).


The Milton example is an unusual one, but it is possible to give a less unusual one. A decent teacher
can teach you to decode Russian letters (or the letters used in many other writing systems) in the


Appendix A: Overview of the Skills Strand
**265**


**266**



course of a couple days of intensive work. Since you already know a lot about reading, all you would
need to learn is which sound values the unfamiliar letters stand for. Once you learned that, you
would be able to sound out most of the words in the language, but nobody would claim that you are
reading Russian. You would have some rudimentary decoding skills (D > 0), but you would be lacking
language comprehension (C = 0). You would be able to pronounce words, but you would not be able
to make sense of them. Essentially, you would be doing what Milton’s daughters did.


~~**HOW THESE IDEAS INFORM THIS PROGRAM**~~


Although this may seem very abstract and theoretical, there are two ideas here that are very
important for reading instruction and for understanding this program. The first important idea
is that reading comprehension depends crucially on both decoding skills (D) and language
comprehension ability (C); the second is that language comprehension ability takes much longer to
acquire than decoding skills.


Milton chose to teach his daughters decoding skills because he could teach those relatively quickly.
It would have taken him much, much longer to build up their language comprehension abilities.
Likewise, in the hypothetical example just given, a decent teacher could teach you to decode
Russian print in a few days of intensive instruction, but he or she would need to keep working with
you for many weeks—possibly even many years—to teach you enough Russian words and phrases to
understand a movie, make sense of a radio report, or read a short story.


You are facing a similar situation as a teacher in the early grades. You want your students to learn
to read. A crucial first step is to teach them decoding skills. Strong decoding skills can be taught
to most young children throughout Grades K–3. It takes longer to teach decoding skills to young
children who are learning to read for the first time than it does to teach the same skills to adults
who have already learned to read in another language, and it takes longer to teach decoding skills in
English-speaking countries because English spelling is rather complex; but even so, most students
can acquire basic decoding ability in the early grades. The children will continue to automatize their
decoding skills, learn new spelling patterns, and build fluency for many more years, but the basics
can be taught in Grades K–3.


That is not the case with language comprehension ability. It is going to take you and your school
system a long time to build up your students’ language comprehension ability because this is not a
job you can accomplish in the course of a single school year. Rather, language comprehension ability
is acquired over many years. Your students began to develop a rudimentary ability to understand
language even before they could speak and continued to increase their language comprehension
abilities throughout the preschool years. They will make even more gains in your classroom and the
classrooms they join after yours. With each new sentence they read or hear, and each new subject
they study in school, they will be building up background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural
literacy, thus increasing the range of materials they are equipped to understand, first orally and later


Foundational Skills 1


via reading. The more you teach them and the more you expose them to, the more they will be able
to understand. It takes a long time to build up the vocabulary and knowledge needed to make sense
of most stories in a newspaper or magazine, but this buildup is crucial for your students’ reading
abilities: no matter how good their decoding skills may be, they will not understand what they read
unless they have the language comprehension ability to make sense of the words they decode.


The program includes two strands of instruction, and these strands correspond with the elements of
reading isolated in the simple view of reading. The Skills Strand is meant to build students’ decoding
skills (D), while the Knowledge Strand is meant to build students’ language comprehension ability
(C) by exposing them to vocabulary, concepts, and ideas through frequent reading aloud. It is
important to understand that both strands are crucial for reading comprehension in later grades.
You may feel the decoding skills taught in the Skills Strand are more important to teach in the early
grades, and certainly, this is the area where you can expect to have the most immediate impact,
but it is important that you not neglect language comprehension ability. Remember, it takes many
years to build up enough vocabulary and general knowledge to understand a wide range of printed
materials. The building of background knowledge needs to begin in Kindergarten (if not before) and
continue throughout the elementary and middle school years.


If students are not building their language comprehension ability in the early grades, their reading
scores are likely to begin to fall off in Grade 4 and later. This has been called the “fourth-grade
slump,” and it occurs because material assessed on reading tests changes over time. As students
progress through the grades, test questions focus less on rudimentary decoding skills and more
on comprehension—and comprehension depends on having sufficient vocabulary, background
knowledge, and cultural literacy to understand the words you are decoding. Thus, the importance
of language comprehension ability increases with time. A weakness in this area may not show up on
tests in early grades, but it will show up in later elementary grades.


This has been well documented in research. In one very interesting study, researchers at the
University of Kansas looked at measurements of reading comprehension (R), decoding/word
recognition (D), and listening comprehension (C) for the same 570 students in the second, fourth,
and eighth grades. They found the two factors D and C accurately predicted R in each grade
but that C became more important, in the sense that it explained more of the variation among
students over time. The measure of decoding (D) was extremely important in the second-grade
results. Twenty-seven percent of the variance in reading comprehension in second grade could be
explained by decoding skills (D) alone. Only 9 percent of the variance could be explained by listening
comprehension (C) alone. By fourth grade, however, the measure of listening comprehension
had begun to account for more variance: the unique contribution of C rose to 21 percent, while
the equivalent number for D fell. By eighth grade, fully 36 percent of the variance in reading
comprehension scores could be explained with reference to the children’s listening comprehension
ability. The unique contribution of D sank even further. In other words, while reading comprehension
depended on D and C at every stage, as the simple view would predict, C explained more and more


Appendix A: Overview of the Skills Strand
**267**


**268**



of the variation among students as time went by. What this tells us is that, once the intricacies of
decoding are mastered (and in English, this takes some time), reading comprehension depends
more and more heavily on language comprehension. Language comprehension depends on
background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural literacy.


~~**TWO MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT READING AND WRITING**~~


The Skills Strand teaches the mechanics of both reading and writing. It is based on the most current
research on reading and writing, but at the same time, it has been written in opposition to some ideas
that have been very influential in elementary education in recent decades. Two of those ideas are:


 - Learning to read and write is natural.


 - Learning to read and write is easy.


Both of these ideas have great emotional appeal. Unfortunately, both of them are wrong.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT NATURAL**~~


Many scholars have argued that spoken language is natural for human beings. The cognitive
scientist Stephen Pinker, for example, has argued that human beings have a language instinct,
meaning that humans are born with an innate capacity for learning language. This may turn out to
be true. It is at least a plausible theory since historians, linguists, and anthropologists have never
found a human culture that does not use language. When something is universal, it may turn out to
be natural.


What is true of oral language is not necessarily true of written language. In fact, with written
language, we know we are dealing with something that is not natural or innate because we know
when and where writing was invented, and we know that, even today, not all languages have a
system of writing. There are still hundreds of languages in the world that are spoken but not written
or read.


Ten thousand years ago this was the norm rather than an exception. At that time, there were
probably no human beings who knew how to read or write. According to the linguist Florian
Coulmas, the idea of writing down language was probably developed independently by three ancient
cultures: the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, and the Chinese. Each used a slightly different system, and
the mechanisms these pioneers developed for recording speech then spread from one culture to
another, evolving as they went. If these initial inventors had not come up with schemes for writing
down speech, we might all be illiterate today.


Writing is many things. It is an art that can be taught and learned. It is an invention—one of the
greatest inventions in human history. It is a technology enabling us to do things we could not do


Foundational Skills 1


without it—a technology every bit as exciting and amazing as airplane flight or electric power. But
it is not natural. The same is true of reading, which is simply the process of unpacking, or decoding,
what somebody else has written.


Reading and writing are both highly artificial. We tend to recoil at that word. We have internalized the
idea that natural is good and artificial is bad. Therefore, we think, reading must be natural. In fact, as
the reading researcher Philip Gough has written, reading is a highly unnatural act.


The first step toward good reading and writing instruction is to understand that reading and writing
are artificial—but not necessarily in a bad sense. We need to remind ourselves that the word _artificial_
derives from the word _art_ . To say reading and writing are forms of art that had to be invented and
need to be taught to children does not make reading and writing any less wonderful or important.
On the contrary, it makes these things more wonderful and precious, and it also emphasizes the
importance of your job as a teacher. There is no job more important than teaching young children
the magnificent, valuable, and highly unnatural arts of reading and writing.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT EASY**~~


The second idea noted earlier, that learning to read and write is easy, is also mistaken. Reading and
writing are complex behaviors, and they are more complex in English than in many other languages
because English has a fairly complicated spelling system. In Spanish, for example, the relationships
between letters and sounds are mostly one-to-one, meaning each sound is usually written with
one spelling, and each spelling unit is usually pronounced one way. This is not the case in English.
To read and write English with a high degree of accuracy, there is quite a lot that students need to
learn.


As a way of demonstrating the complexity involved in learning to read and write in English, suppose
we attempted to list all the discrete bits of information a person needs to know in order to be able
to read and write in English. As a starting point, we might begin with the 26 letters and argue that
these are the 26 things one really needs to learn to read and write English. However, for each letter,
one eventually needs to learn not only the letter shape but also the letter name (to be able to read
abbreviations and initials). So that is 52 bits of information.


That is a good start, but we must not stop there. In English, all letters can be written in uppercase
and lowercase forms, and the uppercase forms are not always the same as the lowercase forms.
Compare ‘B’ to ‘b,’ ‘D’ to ‘d,’ ‘H’ to ‘h,’ ‘R’ to ‘r,’ and ‘Q’ to ‘q.’ At least 16 uppercase letters have a slightly
different form than the matching lowercase letters. So we must raise our estimate of the complexity
of the English writing system to 68 bits of information.


We are not done yet. Students must also know the 44 sounds these letters stand for. That raises our
estimate of the complexity to 112.


Appendix A: Overview of the Skills Strand
**269**


**270**



If there were a simple one-to-one relationship between letters and sounds, that might be a fairly
good estimate of the complexity of the code. Unfortunately, the relationships between sounds and
letters in English are quite complicated. The 44 sounds of English can be spelled many different
ways. In our work on this program, we have identified 150 spellings that are frequent enough to be
worth teaching in the early grades. That boosts our estimate of the complexity of the code to 262.


In addition, students need to learn to track from left to right, blend sounds into words (when
reading), and segment words into sounds (when writing and spelling). They need to learn a handful
of symbols used in writing, including the period, comma, exclamation point, question mark,
quotation mark, and apostrophe. That raises our estimate of code complexity to about 270 bits of
information.


We could boost the estimate even higher by adding Tricky Words and unusual spellings or by
pointing out that many letters in English can be pronounced in different ways. We could also point
out that reading a word like _thin_ requires students to group the first two letters and attach them to
one sound, and reading a word like _cake_ requires students to scan ahead, see the ‘e,’ and realize it
controls the pronunciation of the ‘a’ earlier.


Even without these additions, it is clear that the English writing system is quite complicated.


~~**THE PROBLEM WITH WHOLE LANGUAGE**~~


On a conservative estimate, there are 270 bits of knowledge a person needs to be able to read and
write English. It is unwise to ask students to tackle all this complexity at once and hope they will
figure it out. Yet that is precisely what is done in so-called “Whole Language” approaches. Whole
Language instruction is based on the assumption that learning to read is natural and not difficult,
so reading skills can be allowed to develop gradually, without much explicit instruction. Lots of
students in Whole Language classrooms do manage to figure out the English writing system, but
many others do not. Whole Language ideas have tremendous emotional appeal, but the Whole
Language approach is actually a recipe for _leaving many children behind_ . It is an especially risky
strategy for disadvantaged children.


A much better strategy is to introduce the English spelling code explicitly, beginning with the
easiest, least ambiguous, and most frequently used parts of the code and then adding complexity
gradually. That is the central strategy on which this program is based.


The strategy adopted in this program is the same strategy that successful coaches use when
teaching children a sport such as tennis. The successful coach does not ask students to learn
“Whole Tennis” and soak up the necessary skills all at once by trying to hit all different kinds of
shots the first day on the court. Instead, the successful coach teaches the student to hit a forehand
ground stroke and provides lots of practice hitting forehands. Then the coach moves on to teach


Foundational Skills 1


a backhand ground stroke, then a forehand volley, then a backhand volley, then a serve, then an
overhead smash, then a drop shot, etc. With each element taught, the student becomes a stronger
and more complete player. In the same way, this program begins by teaching the most common and
least ambiguous spellings for sounds and then moves on to introduce the more complex parts of the
writing system.


~~**KEY ASPECTS OF THE SKILLS STRAND**~~


Some key aspects of the Skills Strand are listed below.


  - This program teaches reading and writing in tandem, since they are inverse processes. English
writing involves making pictures of sounds; reading involves translating those pictures back into
sounds and blending the sounds to make words.


  - This program includes explicit, systematic phonic instruction in which students are taught target
skills needed to independently decode and encode words.


  - This program explicitly teaches letter-sound correspondences as opposed to leaving students to
figure these out on their own or deduce them by analyzing familiar whole words (as in some forms of
“analytic” phonics).


  - This program focuses on sounds, or phonemes, as the primary organizing principle of the program,
rather than letters.


  - This program focuses consistently on the phoneme, or single sound, and not on larger units.
Students learn to read words that contain onsets, rimes, and consonant clusters, but they learn to
view and process these larger units as combinations of smaller phoneme-level units. Rimes like _–ick_
and initial clusters like _st–_ are not taught as units but as combinations.


  - This program uses a synthetic phonics approach that teaches students to read by blending through
the whole word; it does not teach multiple cueing strategies, use of pictures as a primary resource in
decoding, or part-word guessing.


  - This program begins by teaching the most common or least ambiguous spelling for a sound (the
basic code spelling); later it teaches spelling alternatives for sounds that can be spelled several
different ways. Thus, the system is kept simple at first, and complexity is added bit by bit as students
gain confidence and automatize their reading and writing skills.


  - This program includes words, phrases, and stories for students to read and activity pages for them to
complete that allow for focused, distributed practice working with the letter-sound correspondences
they have been taught.


  - This program does not require students to read words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have learned. In other words, all words students are asked to read as
part of the program are decodable, either because they are composed entirely of letter-sound


Appendix A: Overview of the Skills Strand
**271**


**272**



correspondences students have been taught or because they are Tricky Words that have been
taught. This means students have a chance to begin reading words and stories that are completely
decodable before tackling words and stories that are full of spelling alternatives.


 - This program does not require students to write words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have been taught. In other words, students are only asked to write words that
can be spelled (at least plausibly if not always correctly) using the code knowledge they have been
taught.


 - This program carefully controls the introduction of Tricky Words and words with ambiguous or rare
spellings, preferring to have students learn to read and write with regular words that can be blended
and spelled by the letter-sound correspondences taught.


 - High-frequency words compiled from a research-based list for Grade 3 are also taught as they appear
in the unit Readers. They are revisited frequently to build automaticity and fluency.


 - This program avoids letter names because what is important for reading is not the letter name but
the sound value the letter stands for. To read the word _cat_, it is essential to know /k/ /a/ /t/, not “see
aay tee.”


~~**THE BASIC AND ADVANCED CODE**~~


The program teaches the highly complex letter-sound correspondences of the English language
in an explicit and systematic manner in Kindergarten–Grade 3. Students are taught how the 26
letters (or graphemes) of the alphabet are used in various combinations to represent 44 sounds (or
phonemes). There are approximately 150 different spellings for these sounds.


Students are first taught the basic code for each of the 44 phonemes. The basic code spelling for
a sound is usually the most common, or the least ambiguous, spelling for a sound. By learning
these letter-sound correspondences first, students experience a high degree of predictability, and
therefore success, in decoding words with these spellings.


Basic code spellings may be single letters, such as these spellings and sounds: ‘a’ > /a/, ‘e’ > /e/,
‘b’ > /b/, and ‘m’ > /m/. Basic code spellings may also include digraphs, or two letters to represent
a sound, such as ‘ee’ > /ee/, ‘oy’ > /oi/, ‘ou’ > /ow/, ‘sh’ > /sh/, and ‘th’ > /th/. Other basic code
spellings include separated digraphs, such as ‘a_e’ > /ae/, and ‘o_e’ > /oe/.


The advanced code consists of all other spelling alternatives (over 100) that may be used to spell
the 44 phonemes in English. Examples of alternative spellings include ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘ss’ > /s/, ‘c’

- /s/, ‘g’ > /j/, ‘ay’ > /ae/, and ‘ey’ > /ee/. Some of these spelling alternatives occur relatively
frequently in the English language, while others are quite rare. See the provided charts for the basic
and advanced code.

Foundational Skills 1


~~**TRICKY WORDS**~~


The term _Tricky Word_ is used in this program to refer to a word that does not “play by the rules” of
spelling and/or pronunciation. Examples of Tricky Words include _one_, _said_, _of_, _were_, and _have_ .


You can describe the trickiness of a Tricky Word like _said_ in two ways. If you think about it from a
spelling point of view, you might say that the word _said_ is tricky because the sound /e/ is not spelled
with an ‘e,’ as you might expect it would be. On the other hand, if you think about it from a reading
point of view, you might say the word is tricky because the letters ‘ai’ are not pronounced /ae/, as
you might expect they would be. Either way you look at it, _said_ is a Tricky Word.


But notice that the word is not completely irregular, either. The first letter and the last letter are
pronounced exactly as you would expect. It is only the second and third letters, representing the
vowel sound, that are not sounded as you would expect. Or, if you prefer to look at things from the
speller’s perspective, you might say the first and last sound are spelled just as you would expect; it
is only the middle sound—the vowel sound—that is spelled irregularly. This is the case with many
Tricky Words: most of them have a regular part (or parts) and then a tricky part. More often than
not, you will find that the tricky part involves the vowel sound and its spelling.


When you are asked to teach a Tricky Word, the guidelines in the Teacher Guide will generally prompt
you to begin by reminding students that not all words play by the rules and words that do not play
by the rules are called Tricky Words. Next, the Teacher Guide will generally suggest that you write
the Tricky Word on the board. You may wish to ask a student to read the word as he or she thinks it
might be sounded (i.e., to blend according to the normal procedures). Alternatively, you can read the
Tricky Word that way yourself. Then you can point out how the word is actually pronounced. Once
you have established the actual pronunciation, you can point out and/or discuss what is regular and
what is irregular about the word. Most Tricky Words have at least some parts pronounced exactly the
way you would expect. For example, as noted above, the first and last letter in _said_ are pronounced
just as one would expect. After discussing the regular parts, you should then draw attention to the
tricky part (or parts) of the word, pointing out letters not pronounced as one might expect they
would be (e.g., the ‘ai’ in _said_ ). This is the part of the word that students just have to remember.


By drawing attention to the regular as well as the irregular parts of the word, you teach students
that Tricky Words are only partial exceptions to the normal rules of reading and writing. (They are
not so much irregular as they are a little less regular than most words.) There are some parts of the
word spelled just as you would expect and also pronounced just as you would expect. Then there are
some others that are not. There is a subtle but important difference between teaching Tricky Words
this way and teaching them as single entities that have to be memorized as wholes, as if every part
of the word were unpredictable.


Appendix A: Overview of the Skills Strand
**275**


**276**



Note that some Tricky Words are actually part of spelling patterns. For example, the words _he_, _she_,
_we_, _be_, and _me_ are taught as Tricky Words in earlier grades because it is hard to write stories without
them. However, once the ‘e’ spelling alternative for /ee/ is taught, these Tricky Words can be seen
as part of a larger pattern that includes words like _replay_ and _prefix_ . Other Tricky Words, such as
_one_ and _of_, remain tricky even when most of the spelling alternatives have been taught. By Grade 3,
students have been taught the majority of the code knowledge needed to decode most words in the
English language. As such, there is less of an emphasis on Tricky Words in the Grade 3 program.


~~**SIGHT WORDS AND TRICKY WORDS**~~


One of the most common terms in the world of reading instruction is _sight word_ . Unfortunately, this
is also a rather ambiguous and potentially confusing term. Educators use the term _sight word_ in
two different senses. For some people, sight words are high-frequency words that students need to
encounter frequently and learn to decode rapidly and effortlessly. Other people use the term _sight_
_word_ in a more restrictive sense, to refer to words that cannot be sounded out using letter-sound
correspondences and may need to be taught as exceptions.


In this program, we define these terms as follows:


 - A Tricky Word is a word that does not play by the rules. It is a word containing at least one part that
cannot be read correctly via blending or cannot be spelled correctly using the code knowledge taught
so far.


 - A sight word is a high-frequency word that we want students to see many, many times and learn to
read quickly and eventually learn to recognize rapidly.


The main difference here is that a Tricky Word always contains some irregular element, whereas a
sight word might or might not.


There is considerable overlap between the two categories (which is probably why the two senses of
_sight word_ are regularly confused). Some words qualify as sight words because they are used a lot
and also as Tricky Words because they are not pronounced (or written) as you would expect. These
are words that are both irregular (and therefore hard to read and write, at least at first) and also very
common (and therefore important for student success). They are candidates for special instruction,
and many of them are given special instruction in this program.


Tricky Words do not qualify as sight words on most lists because they are not especially common.
Words of this sort are sprinkled throughout the language but do not receive much attention because
they are only used occasionally. Students can learn them as the need arises in upper grades.


Foundational Skills 1


~~**CUSTOMIZING AND ADAPTING THE PROGRAM**~~


This is a highly structured and sequenced program. We are unapologetic about that, as we believe
the structure and sequence will be very helpful to students as they work to learn the English spelling
code. However, this is not a scripted program in which teachers are required to read the manual and
give one of a handful of approved responses. We expect—indeed, we hope—teachers will tweak the
phrasing and come up with ways to customize, personalize, and adapt the instruction.


Our goal has been to put things in a logical order and provide all the guidance and support
necessary for a new teacher, or a teacher new to this kind of phonics instruction.


At the same time, we believe there is room for experienced and creative teachers to customize
and adapt the program. Indeed, some of the exercises included in this version of the program were
developed by teachers in our pilot programs!


Sometimes in the lessons, we give exact phrasing that we suggest you use; more often, however, we
give indirect phrasing and/or encourage you to explain something using your own words. You should
feel free to make changes to the phrasing. For example, you may prefer to speak of “a picture of a
sound” or a “spelling.” Later in the year, you may want to teach the term _digraph_, or you may prefer
to refer to the letters in a digraph as a “letter team” or as “buddy letters.” There are many ways to
customize the program and the language while preserving the basic instructional principles and
sequence of instruction.


For the presentation of words, you may write on a chalkboard, a whiteboard, chart paper, an
overhead projector, a document camera, or the projection system of your choice. A projection
system works especially well for activity pages since it allows the teacher to model the task exactly
as the students will be completing it. You may use a pocket chart, a magnetic board with magnetic
letters, an overhead projector with letters cut from a transparency, or a smart board. Many
modifications of this sort can be made without adversely impacting the quality of the instruction.


You should also always feel free to add additional activities and activity pages that are consistent
with our philosophy of instruction. You should always feel free to respond to the teachable moment,
even if it leads you slightly off the path laid out in the Teacher Guide.


There are only a handful of things you should not do:


You should not skip a lesson in which new code knowledge is taught. If you do, students will lack
important code knowledge, untaught spellings will begin to appear in their word lists and on their
activity pages, and the lessons will start to make less sense to them.


For the same reasons, you should not reorder the lessons. The program relies heavily on sequencing,
and instruction will be confused and less effective if the lessons are reordered.


Appendix A: Overview of the Skills Strand
**277**


**278**



~~**SMALL-GROUP WORK**~~


Large parts of this program have been written for whole-group instruction, but the program can be
customized to allow for small-group instruction of various kinds. You will note that there are Support
and Challenge sidebars sprinkled throughout the lessons that will guide you in how to differentiate
instruction for your students, while still using the whole-class approach described in the lessons.


Since some students will learn the new information right away while others will need more practice,
you may wish to do small-group work to follow up the initial introduction of code knowledge. You will
note that many lessons do include suggestions for small groups; you should feel free to adapt these
and other lessons as best meets the needs of your students. We have seen this program taught very
effectively in small groups and in workstations students visit on rotation.


~~**ADJUSTING THE SPEED OF INSTRUCTION**~~


This sequence will work for most children. However, all children are different, and all classrooms are
different. Some classrooms may need more time to master concepts than others. The program has
been designed so the pace of instruction can be adjusted as needed.


The most important thing for you to know is that you can pause at any point in the program.
If students are not learning the material, simply stop where you are and do additional work to
accelerate or reteach as needed. All lessons contain some materials you can use if you pause.


In addition, at the end of each unit there is a “Pausing Point.” If the end-of-unit assessment or your
observations suggest some members of the class need additional time to master the concepts
taught in the unit, this is an especially good place to stop and provide additional practice and
review. The Teacher Guides include additional work at each Pausing Point. They will typically provide
enough for at least 1–2 days of additional work. The materials provided in the Pausing Point can be
used in various ways. Sometimes you may wish to have all students do the same activity or activity
page. At other times you may wish to work individually or in small groups with students who need
additional help with a particular concept.


To slow down instruction, you can pause either in the middle of a unit or at a Pausing Point. We do
not recommend that you attempt to speed up the sequence of instruction. The program lays out an
ambitious program of instruction.


The Grade 3 program of instruction should work well for a wide range of students. You should begin
with the assumption that the Grade 3 program is an appropriate option for all students in the class.


Foundational Skills 1


Inevitably, however, there will be differences in learning. Students learn at different rates. Some
students will pick up the material quickly; others will have more difficulty. There are many strategies
for dealing with this. In general, we encourage you to try to keep most of the class together if it
makes sense. It is much easier to teach one set of students at roughly the same level than it is to
teach two or three groups at very different levels.


If you find some students are lagging, you may still be able to keep the class together for the main
lessons but find extra time two to four times a week to work with those students who seem to need
extra practice.


If this is not sufficient, you may eventually need to regroup some students. As we note in Lessons
4–5 of this unit, it is especially important to administer the placement assessment to all students at
the start of the year. We strongly recommend that teachers then use an “across grade” approach to
grouping students. If there are two classrooms, these two teachers should look at all of the Grade 3
students in both classrooms and consider regrouping students for Skills instruction only, with one
teacher taking the class of students who need review and more practice, while the other teacher
works with those students ready to move on to Grade 3 Skills instruction. It will likely be worthwhile
to reconvene at multiple times during the year to plan across the grade level, using the end-of-unit
assessments. In this way, students in need of acceleration can be moved to the appropriate group,
while students who are making progress can advance.

**Appendix C:**
#### Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words

Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught will enable students to read onesyllable words with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences is no
guarantee that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllabic words. To this
end, most students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk, and read
parts of words—syllables—to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can then
be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated, and students are expected
to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, the program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the easiest
two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is already a
familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In addition, each
syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing, hunt·er, bust·ed_ ). The
dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain double-letter
spellings for consonants, in this program, the divider is typically placed after the double-letter
spelling rather than between the two consonants (e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers that are
familiar with other ways to chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is done, however,
because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single-spelling units since kindergarten
(‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.). The program strives to be consistent in representing these
spellings in the way that the students have been taught to process them (e.g., as whole entities
for a sound). (Ultimately, as students become more proficient at decoding and chunking syllables
through subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually chunk and decode
these words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding these two-syllable
words consisting of root words and suffixes relatively easy.


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable words.


Foundational Skills 1


To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


**• Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound (e.g.,**
/ **a** / **,** / **e** / **,** / **i** / **,** / **o** / **,** / **u** / **):** _let_, _pad_, _rod_, _tin_, _fun_, _pic·nic_, _un·til_


**• Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g.,** / **ae** / **,** / **ee** / **,** /
**ie** / **,** / **oe** / **,** / **ue** / **):** _cake_, _home_, _like_, _mule_, _Pete_, _mis·take_, _stam·pede_


**• Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint_, _speak_, _proud_, _play_, _dis·may_, _be·low_, _coun·sel_


**• R-Controlled Syllables:** _art_, _curb_, _girl_, _fort_, _clerk_, _tur·nip_, _ar·tist_, _fe·ver_


**• Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g.,** / **ae** / **,** / **ee** / **,** / **ie** / **,**
/ **oe** / **,** / **ue** / **):** _go_, _me_, _hi_, _a·pron_, _f·nal_, _com·pre·hend_


**• Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple_, _puz·zle_, _raf·fe_, _ca·ble_, _ri·fe_


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


**• Schwa Syllables:** _ben·e·fit_, _ap·pe·tite_, _a·bout_, _hos·pit·al_, _e·mo·tion_


Note: The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately because
of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


To decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these names. The names of the
syllable types are provided here only to establish a common vocabulary for teachers as they use
the materials. What is necessary, however, for students to become fluent readers of longer words in
increasingly complex text is that they be able to visually parse certain spelling patterns as syllable
chunks so they can quickly and easily decode each syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.


Appendix B: Scope and Sequence
**289**


_ad·mit_ _nap·kin_ t _rum·pet_


For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed after
the double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is because the
double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units since kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’

- /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).


_traff·ic_ _muff·in_ _happ·en_


When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.


_mon·ster_ _con·tract_ _pil·grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read
the first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model
for students how to blend the two syllables aloud:







**290**



In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the magic
‘E’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for closed
syllables:


_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


In Grades 2 and 3, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to use


Foundational Skills 1


a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying each
possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:


_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_









However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There is
no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be flexible
and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to determine
whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. To recognize whether a
word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has heard before
(i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent an additional
challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a second language.


If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:


Appendix B: Scope and Sequence
**291**


_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is straightforward.


When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings
in the words.


_ban · gle_ _twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_









**292**



Foundational Skills 1


In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings represent
the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a combination of
stressed and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed or weakly
stressed, its vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that linguists call
a schwa. This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’
and ‘tion’. Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite challenging for
many students.


Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the
schwa sound has a particular spelling:


_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is a schwa syllable, but it is identified separately
because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables
accordingly throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness_ _help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten–Grade
3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.
