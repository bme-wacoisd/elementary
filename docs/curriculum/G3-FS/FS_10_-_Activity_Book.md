###### **Activity Book**

This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 10. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. Teachers will explain these activity
pages to the students orally, using the instructions in the Teacher Guide. There are also instructions
on the activity pages for students to read themselves. The Activity Book is a student component,
which means each student should have an Activity Book.

Hannah was excited that her package was being delivered today!
She watched her front door closely, waiting for the delivery man to
appear. Before he could ring her doorbell, Hannah threw open the
door and took the package. She thanked him quickly before returning
inside.


It was time to her new computer.
She noticed that the packaging was very,
and she worried that her computer might not be in the best shape.
However, to her delight, everything inside the package was just
fine. There was a -shaped box with a
of cords inside that she set aside.


When she opened the box that held her computer, she let out
an excited shriek. She realized she had to

the computer in, and waited for it to charge.

##### **Read and Write: − ble, − tle, − gle**



Dear Family Member,


Your student has practiced spelling words with the final
stable syllables − _ble_, − _tle_, and − _gle_ . Ask your student to
read each word aloud to you. Share the meaning of each
word with your student. Then, have them draw a slash (/)
to separate the syllables in each word. Finally, have your
student write a sentence using each word. Remind them
to write neatly in cursive, leaving spaces between words.
Throughout the week, make it a point to draw attention to
words that you and your student see that end in − _ble_, − _tle_,
or − _gle_ . Each time a word is identified, ask your student to
say it aloud.

|hum/ble|My mom is a humble person who never<br>takes credit for all of her hard work.|

In the heart of the city of Houston, TX,
### **Texas**
a small bookshop named Reed's Reads, owned by Mr.

, Arthur Reed, stood proudly on Cobblestone Ln.
, Mr. Reed, a lover of literature and adventure, decided to add a
new section to his shop one sunny Fri., in Aug
,.


He measured a corner space perfect for a new bookshelf and
found it to be exactly 8 ft wide. That same day,
Ella entered the shop, excited about her trip planned for the next yr.
. She was thrilled to see the new travel section because she was
planning a trip across the USA .


To assist his customers better, Mr. Reed set up an FAQ

section in his shop. This area
provided answers to common questions about travel, literature, and
specific destinations, including VIP

spots in big cities.


The travel literature section quickly became popular among
Houston residents. It was not just a source of information but also an
inspiration for many who dreamed of exploring the world beyond.

try to generate additional words using those affixes.

**Alexa's Music Lesson**


Alexa had always wanted to play an instrument. She liked the
drums and was hopeful that her parents would allow her to play. Her
friends were particularly chatty about joining the school band, and she
wanted to join, too.


Alexa asked her parents for permission to begin taking drum
lessons. They said yes! On a foggy Monday afternoon, they scheduled
an appointment with the music teacher. Alexa could not wait for the
lesson to begin. She looked forward to making beautiful music. In all
of the excitement, Alexa was worried that she would be forgetful, so she
packed up her drum kit the night before the lesson. Alexa hoped that p
laying the drums would be effortless for her, but that is not exactly
what happened.

At her very first lesson, Alexa realized that playing the drums would
take lots of practice and hard work. The teacher began the lesson
by playing for Alexa. Her teacher kept a steady beat on the drums,
producing a powerful sound. However, when it was her turn, under
the watchful eye of her teacher, it did not sound the same. Her teacher
showed her kindness and encouraged her to not give up. Her teacher
made her realize that she would make progress if she worked hard. Alexa
was determined to become an excellent drummer and join the school
marching band.

Read aloud the text below.

##### **Rohan and Mittens**


Rohan's next door neighbor was Mrs. Garcia. Mrs. Garcia was
known in the neighborhood for having eighteen cats, all of whom she
lovingly cared for. One day, Rohan was playing outside, and he heard
some purring noises coming from Mrs. Garcia's backyard.


Rohan loved to play with Mrs. Garcia's cats, so he went to see
what was happening. To his surprise, he found one of Mrs. Garcia's
kittens on a tree branch. The poor kitten was stuck, and it was in
trouble.


Without hesitation, Rohan decided to help. He gathered some
leaves to make a soft landing spot on the ground around the tree in
case he or the kitten needed it. Then, he climbed up, reached the little
kitten, and gently brought it down. The kitten purred with gratitude.


Mrs. Garcia watched Rohan's act of kindness and smiled warmly.
“Thank you, Rohan! You've saved Mittens. I couldn't have reached
him without your help.”


Rohan beamed with pride. He realized that even a small act of
kindness can make a big difference. From that day on, Rohan and
Mittens became best buddies.

Rohan and Mrs. Garcia spent many afternoons together in Mrs.
Garcia's backyard. The eighteen cats would playfully chase butterflies,
and Mittens would often curl up in Rohan's lap, purring happily.


One day, Mrs. Garcia fell ill and needed to stay in the hospital.
Since Rohan knew how much Mrs. Garcia loved her cats, he wanted
to help her. So, he fed them and played with them. He took special
care of Mittens as if he were his own. He even visited Mrs. Garcia
in the hospital. Mrs. Garcia was touched by Rohan's kindness and
recovered faster than expected. She returned home to her eighteen
happy and healthy cats. She was grateful to have Rohan as a good
neighbor and a caring friend.
