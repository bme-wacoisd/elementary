# **Welcome!**
### **Grade 3, Unit 10**
## **Foundational Skills**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will learn new spelling patterns, abbreviations, and idioms, and they will review affixes,
final stable syllables, and compound words..


**What will my student learn?**


Students will learn the new spelling patterns _eigh_ as in _weight_ and _ough_ as in _bought_ . They will review final
stable syllables and compound words to practice breaking down longer words into manageable parts.
Students will also review affixes _im–_, _in–_, _pre–_, _–ness_, _–y_, and _–ful_, which can change the meaning of base
words. Students will then learn new abbreviations and idioms. Abbreviations shorten words, and idioms
are phrases or expressions that have a figurative meaning different from the literal meaning of the words.
Students will practice reading with the Reader, _Sam’s Musical Journey_, about a boy named Sam who loves
music. The Reader details the challenges Sam faces and overcomes as he learns to play the piano and
ultimately performs at a school talent show. The story demonstrates the rewards of perseverance and the joy
of sharing a love of music with others.


**Additional Practice**

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|_brilliant_|_journey_|_technique_|_rhythm_|_language_|_distinguishing_|
|_doubting_|_conquer_|_natural_|_annual_|_routines_||



Students can practice these words each night by doing the following activities:

1. **Word Association:** Ask your student to think of other words related to the Tricky Words. This
will help to reinforce their understanding of each word’s meaning and usage.

2. **Spell and Define:** Choose a few Tricky Words from the list and ask your student to spell each
word aloud. Once they’ve spelled a word correctly, discuss the meaning of the word together.


|Words That Follow a Spelling Pattern|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**eigh**|_eight_|_sleighed_|_neighbor_|_lightweight_|
|**ough**|_enough_|_doughy_|_thoughts_|_coughing_|


Students can practice these words each night by doing the following activities:

1. **Drawing and Writing:** Invite your student to write a sentence using the focus spelling
patterns and then to draw a picture to match their sentence.

2. **Word Challenges:** Challenge your student to find words with the focus spelling patterns in
books, in magazines, or around the house. When they identify a word, discuss its spelling
and meaning.
