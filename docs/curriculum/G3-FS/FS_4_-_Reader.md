**Chapter**
### **Frankie Forgets**
# **1**

A curious and **active** little girl, Frankie,
lived with her mom, her dad, and her little
brother, Cal. She was always looking for
the next adventure. Frankie had a million
questions about the world, but sometimes she
was a little too busy being curious instead of
staying **focused** .


One day, as Frankie was getting dressed for
school, her mom walked past her bedroom and
said, “Don’t forget to make your bed, Frankie.
Also, put your pajamas in the laundry basket
and brush your teeth before we leave.” _Oops! I_
_forgot!_ thought Frankie.



1


After school, Frankie went to the park
with her dad and brother. She and Cal played
together on the jungle gym while her dad read
a book under a tree nearby. Cal wanted to play
their favorite game, “Mighty Monster,” a game
where one of them pretends to be a monster
and catches the other. Frankie decided to be
the monster first and took off running beneath
the jungle gym to tag Cal. She raced between
the poles, her fingers just the slightest bit out of
reach. Just then, Cal ran up the stairs, heading
for the slide. Frankie thought of the perfect plan
to catch him. She turned quickly and **sprinted**
towards the slide. When she was halfway up the
slide, her dad called her name sharply.


“Frankie, no climbing up the slide! That isn’t
safe. Please come back down.”


“Oops! I forgot!” said Frankie under her
breath, as she slid back down.



2


3


The next day was Friday, and Frankie’s class
was going on a field trip to the zoo. The students
could not contain their excitement. They walked
around with their teacher, Ms. Chen, and saw
reptiles, elephants, and monkeys. Zookeepers
explained the **habitats** and habits of each type of
animal. As the class walked past the flamingos,
Frankie saw something thrilling. It was her friend
Alonso’s favorite animal: a meerkat. “Look,
Alonso,” said Frankie eagerly. “Meerkats! Let’s go
see them.”


“Cool!” exclaimed Alonso.


Alonso and Frankie took off, running as fast
as they could toward the meerkat **exhibit** . They
heard Ms. Chen calling after them, shouting,
“Alonso! Frankie! No running or you will
frighten the animals. Please stay with the group.”
_Oops! I forgot!_ thought Frankie.



4


5


That night, Frankie’s family gathered at the
dinner table and talked about their days over
pizza and fruit juice. Frankie’s mom inquired
about the field trip to the zoo. Frankie recounted
the highlights from the trip, repeating animal
facts she learned that day and describing the
amazing critters. Then, she recalled what Ms.
Chen said. Frankie explained that she and Alonso
were excited to get to the meerkats first, even
though they were supposed to walk and stay
together.


Frankie thought about what her dad had said
at the park when she climbed up the slide. She
remembered her mom always asked her to make
her bed, put her things away, and wash her dishes
after dinner.



6


She asked curiously, “Why do we need so
many rules, Mom?



7


**Chapter**
### **Rule Detective**
# **2**

Frankie’s mom understood. Knowing how
she felt, Mom explained, “Rules are like an
unseen base that maintain our **society** . They
help us live together in peace. They help keep
everyone safe and happy.”


Frankie frowned. “I don’t mean to argue,
but I still don’t understand. Would things
really be all that different if there were no
rules?”



8


Her mom said, “Without rules, the world
would be hard to live in. Just imagine if we didn’t
have any rules while driving. That’s how it was
100 years ago. It would be dangerous even to
approach a car. And what if people didn’t have to
wear seatbelts?”


Frankie said, “So rules are just to keep yourself
safe?”


“It is also about keeping other people safe,”
said Mom. “If there is a car accident, not only
could the passengers be hurt, but police and
rescue workers helping to clear the accident
could be at risk.”



9


Her mom continued, “It’s important to have
fun, and rules help us **ensure** everyone can have
fun and stay safe at the same time.”


“I won’t disagree with that!” said Frankie.


Frankie’s mom thought about what her
daughter had said while she chewed her pizza.
She thought of a fun and helpful idea that would
allow Frankie to learn about the value of rules.


With a warm smile, she said, “Let’s figure it
out together. Let’s be on the lookout for rules
while we run errands tomorrow. We’ll be like
detectives. We’ll look for examples of rules in
action!”



10


Frankie’s eyes got wide. Her mom often had
clever ideas. Plus, tomorrow was Saturday, the
perfect day for an adventure. She grinned at her
mom and said, “Yes, please!”



11


Frankie’s dad winked at his daughter and
poked her with an elbow. “What fun things
might you do if there were no rules? Maybe
you could fill the house with sand and make an
indoor beach!” Dad joked.


Frankie and Cal talked together while they ate
dessert about the exciting things they could do
with no rules. Cal suggested eating ice cream for
breakfast. Frankie thought that sounded much
better than her usual oatmeal.


Frankie was lying in bed with her head on
her pillow that night. She dreamed of being a
detective who knows everything about meerkats
and pizza, monsters, and ice cream!



12


13


**Chapter**
### **Swimming Lessons**
# **3**

The next morning, Frankie jumped out
of bed. Unfortunately, there was no time for
breakfast ice cream. Instead, Frankie’s mom
grabbed her a granola bar and fruit juice to eat
on the way to their first stop.


Their adventure began at the local
**recreation center**, where Frankie had
swimming lessons. After putting on her
swimsuit, Frankie walked with her mom from
the locker room to the pool deck. _What rules_
_could there be at a pool?_ she thought. _This place_
_is all about fun!_ “No rules.” She stood on the
pool deck and took off running.



14


15


Suddenly, two things happened at once. Just
as she heard a lifeguard’s whistle, Frankie felt
her foot slip on the wet tile. She spun her arms
wildly, unable to keep her balance. Right before
she crashed to the ground, her mom caught her.
She helped Frankie up as the lifeguard, Marissa,
came over.


“Are you okay?” asked Marissa. “It’s important
not to run on a pool deck. You could easily slip
and fall. I am trained to help and rescue people
when they get injured. But I would rather avoid
that in the first place!”


Frankie looked up at her, feeling **subdued**
now that Marissa had come over to check on her.
She was uncomfortable knowing she was wrong
to run.



16


“I’m sorry. I won’t do it again.”


As Marissa walked away, Frankie’s mom
looked worried. She hugged her daughter. “Are
you sure you are okay? I was so worried you
would hit your head.”




Frankie looked up at her mom. “It was
scary when I thought I would fall. I guess
we discovered our first rule in action: No
running on the pool deck.”


Frankie walked carefully to the **bleachers**
as her mom gave her a small, worried smile.
The instructor, Landon, had everyone
practice their skills at different **stations** in the
pool. He worked with Frankie to review her
turns as she pushed off the wall, kicked, and
then swam back, cruising back to the wall.


Frankie was working hard, and she listened
carefully to Landon’s tips. After she got the
hang of it, he told her to take a break and
catch her breath.



18


Sitting on the stairs, Frankie looked
around the pool. She saw other kids
swimming with the careful guidance of the
instructors. Some older kids were practicing
dives in the deep end. Frankie began thinking
about the pool rules again. She realized it
was important for her to stay in the shallow
end. If she went into the deep end right
then, she might crash into someone diving.
That would have been dangerous. “Hmm,”
thought Frankie to herself. “Maybe that rule
is important, too.” It definitely helped keep
the pool organized. Everyone could safely
have fun, and no one got any bruises.



19


The flavor was unbelievable. She was
hungry for more.


Excitedly, Frankie ran back to her mom.
“They are selling brownies over there! Please
can I buy one? They are so yummy.”




Frankie’s mom looked over at the baker,
and she agreed to give Frankie some cash for
one of the brownies. By the time Frankie had
gotten the $5 bill from her mom, a line had
formed in front of the baker. She looked at
her mom and asked, “Can I get in the front of
the line?”


“Let’s be detectives,” said her mom.
“Somehow all of those people knew to form a
line. Think about this: How do you feel when
Cal skips your turn in a game?”


Frankie thought about this and realized
her mom had a point. When Cal skipped
her turn, it made her angry. Peeking around
the line at the people waiting in front of her,
Frankie counted four of them.



22


She certainly did not want them to feel
angry or upset.


Frankie decided that it would be a mistake
to cut the line. She would wait her turn
instead; it was more fair that way. While
waiting, Frankie noticed that all the lines
were orderly. Everyone was taking their turn
nicely. Frankie thought the market would be
hectic if people disrespected the lines. “Lucky
these people don’t have Cal or me skipping
in front of them,” she thought. “Otherwise,
everyone at this market would be so angry
right now. If we all wait our turn, everything
goes smoothly.”


Even though she had to wait, Frankie’s
brownie tasted amazing when she finally got
to eat it as she and her mom walked through
the market.



23


**Chapter**
### **The Offce**
# **5**

After the market, Frankie’s mom needed to
return to her office for an hour. “Saturday office
visits are always unexpected. We have a big book
about a musician coming out soon, and everyone
is working nonstop to prepare for it. I hope you
are not unhappy about coming with me.”


That was fine with Frankie—she loved
visiting her mom’s publishing office. The office
**clerk**, Luke, always had a little bowl of candy on
his desk that he refilled before the office opened
each day. Frankie waved to Luke and grabbed a
piece of candy from the dish on his desk.



24


Her mom pointed to a chair in the corner
of the big office space.




“Here you go, artist,” she said as she handed
Frankie some paper to draw on while she waited.
As Frankie unwrapped a new pack of markers,
she looked around the office at all the busy
grown-ups working together. Her mom worked
with many different people who were specialists
or experts in certain parts of book publishing.
Some of them **edited** books. Others drew the
cover art. Others sold the books. And she could
not forget the custodian and the office clerk!
Frankie thought about how many people were
part of making just one book come to life. She
was grateful to know everybody in the office did
their part.



26


As she finished a drawing of a mad
scientist, she started thinking like a detective
again. What if there were no rules in her
mom’s office?



27


What if Luke wasn’t at the front desk
to help people or if her mom did not show
up to work? Who would reread the books
before printing them? Frankie wondered if
any books would make it onto a shelf.


Frankie completed a new drawing of
a dragon wearing a top hat as her mom
returned from her desk. Her mom said,
“That’s a great picture. Did you have a good
time?”


“I sure did! I got to be an artist and
a detective at the same time!” Frankie
responded. She returned the markers to their
box and folded up her artwork.



28


29


As they got in the car again, Frankie
asked her mom what working with so many
people felt like. “I get to work with so many
smart and creative people. I love my job, but
it would be much harder if I had to do it
all alone. Knowing we work together to get
books into the world feels good. That’s why
it’s so important for everyone in the office to
do their part. We can get more great books
out there that way.”


Frankie thought her mom had a good
point. Without the different jobs in the
office, she and other kids would miss out
on great books. Maybe an office was a good
place to have a few rules.



30


Everyone worked toward the same
goal in her mom’s office. The rules
helped them get there.



31


**Chapter**
### **The Library**
# **6**

Soon, Frankie and her mother arrived at
the library, but this was different from the
local **branch** Frankie was used to. This library
was huge! Her mom explained it was the main
library branch in their town. Frankie’s eyes
widened with amazement. She was used to
being around books and loved her local library
branch. But this was something different.
Frankie’s jaw dropped as she looked around,
**preoccupied** by her incredible surroundings.


There were thousands of books, maybe even
more. Frankie didn’t think she could begin to
count them all. There was a section with travel
books for tourists. There were books that taught
job skills like how to become a **pharmacist** .



32


She saw books about prehistoric times
and modern history. She saw stories about
big dreams, making mistakes, and how to
**rebound** after a challenge. She saw stories
for college students and preschool students.



33


She saw books about magicians, biologists,
historians, and athletes. At least five librarians
were walking around pulling down books,
scanning them, or putting them back on the
shelves.


“Isn’t it beautiful?” asked her mom. “I don’t
think I have taken you to this library since you
were a baby. They have so many great options.
Maybe you can find a book to read.”


Frankie wandered down the rows of books.
Each book had a sticker on the back, but Frankie
thought she must be misreading them, or maybe
they were misspelled. Frankie needed help to
make sense of the jumble of numbers and letters.
As she came around the corner, a librarian came
out from the children’s section.



34


35


“Hello!” she said. “My name is Sofia. I’m
a librarian, which means I am in charge of
organizing and taking care of the books. Can I
help you find one?”


Frankie looked up at Sofia. “I am looking for
a book about cartoonists. How can you find the
book I’m looking for? There are so many on the
shelves. Do you know where all of these books
are by heart?”


The librarian chuckled and said, “I definitely
don’t know all their places by heart. What I do
know very well is the **system** we use to organize
the books. Here, let me show you.”


Sofia led Frankie to the end of a bookshelf.
Frankie saw a sheet of paper with letters listed on
it. Noticing something else, Frankie said, “It’s in
the order of the alphabet!”



36


37


38


“Exactly,” replied the librarian. “We have
codes that help us keep all the books in the right
place. Then, when people return a book to the
library, we can put it back where it should be.
That way, the next person can find the same
book. It won’t disappear on some other shelf and
never be found again.”


Frankie looked at the section next to them.
“Are these comic books? I want to be an artist
when I grow up.”


“Yes, they are,” said Sofia. “Each one is
organized by the author’s name.”


“What if two people have the same name?”
asked Frankie. “I have two friends at school with
the same last name.”



39


“Great question,” said Sofia. “Look right
here. These books are both by people with the
last name Brown. But this person’s first name
is Alan. Since the letter ‘A’ comes first, that
book will be first on the shelf.”


“That’s a tricky rule,” said Frankie.


Sofia replied, “It might seem hard at
first, but you get used to it with practice.
This system lets us help library visitors, and
everything runs more **smoothly** .”


Sofia helped Frankie find a book. Then,
Frankie and her mom walked out of the
library into the sunny afternoon. “I had no
idea libraries worked like that,” said Frankie.
“I just put my books anywhere on the shelf at
home. That would be a big mistake at a place
like the library.”



40


“That’s right,” replied her mom. “Having
rules in the library is pretty useful.”



41


**Chapter**
### **The Zoo**
# **7**

“I thought we could have one more stop on
our big adventure,” said Frankie’s mom. “How
would you feel about a trip to the zoo? I know
you went with your class yesterday.”


“I love the zoo!” said Frankie. “Let’s do it.”


When they got to the zoo, Frankie and her
mom got popcorn to share while they walked.
They saw a veterinarian checking on a zebra,
who seemed to disagree about taking medicine.
They saw a zookeeper rebuild a broken toy for
a monkey and another person feeding some
animals.



42


43


44


The two watched as zookeepers brought
colorful fruit for the birds, meat for the big cats,
and a bowl of kale for some **unhurried** tortoises.
As they watched, Frankie saw how the zookeepers
entered the habitats. They were being careful and
clearly knew the habits of the animals. As much
as Frankie loved to see the animals, she would
have been nervous to hand a steak to a big tiger.
She would leave that to the professionals.


She thought like a detective again. Frankie
saw that no one was hopping over the fence to
play with the animals. Everyone seemed to know
that wasn’t a good idea. The fences were there for
a reason. They kept people safe, and they kept the
animals safe, too. They prevented everyone from
getting hurt. Even if the animals were nonviolent,
it was still important to respect their space.



45


Later, a kid nearby cried loudly as Frankie and
her mom stood and looked at the meerkats. The
meerkats ran to their tunnels, scared by the noisy
cry. Frankie thought back to her field trip the day
before. It made sense to walk quietly in the zoo.
She didn’t want to scare the animals!


Frankie’s mom noticed they allowed visitors
to pet the kangaroos as they walked past that
area on their way back to the parking lot. Frankie
was thrilled—she had never touched a kangaroo
before! A zookeeper told them the rules for the
kangaroo area. They had to stay on the sidewalk
and were only allowed to touch the kangaroos on
the back. Curious as always, Frankie asked why
they weren’t allowed to touch them on the front
of their bodies.



46


47


48


“Great question! **Zoologists** have learned
kangaroos can move forward more easily than
backward. If they want to hop away, they feel
safer and more comfortable going forward. If
they want space from people, needing to move
backward quickly might stress them out. It
would be a risky mistake to touch them from
the front.”


“Wow,” said Frankie’s mom, “I had no idea!
Thank you for letting us know. We will be sure
to respect them.”


“I want to follow the rules so the kangaroos
are happy,” agreed Frankie. “And I want to stay
safe in here with them, too. We need to get back
home to Dad and Cal **unharmed** !”



49


The family sat down together to dig into
some tacos for dinner. As they ate, Frankie told




She and her mom even did a few **impressions**
of the animals they saw at the zoo that afternoon.
Cal loved it when their mom pretended to be the
zebra who was grouchy about taking medicine.
Frankie said she might want to be a zoologist or a
veterinarian someday.


After Frankie finished her story, her dad raised
an eyebrow. He said, “It sounds like the pair of
you had an amazing and fun day, but you also
detected rules almost nonstop.”


Frankie’s mom smiled. “What do you think,
Frankie?”



52


Frankie returned her mom’s smile. “I learned
today that rules are pretty important whether I
like them or not. It might be frustrating to not
be allowed to do something you want to do, but
I saw today how much we need them. They are
there to keep everyone safe, and you can still
have fun while following the rules.”


“That’s a great point,” added her mom.


“It is healthy to be curious about rules. It’s
also good to know those rules are there to protect
us. They help our community and society live,
work, and play together in peace.”



53


Later that night, Frankie lay in her bed,
tired from the day. She thought about her day
and felt happy she didn’t get eaten by a tiger or
jumped on at the pool. She felt glad she found
a new library book and saw her mom working
at the office. Even though the day was full of
rules, Frankie was not unhappy. She knew she
understood these rules, and today, she had
learned the reasons behind them. Her mom came
in to say good night. Frankie thanked her for the
big adventure.


“I know there are so many rules we have to
live with,” said her mom. “But I had fun learning
about them today with you.”


“So did I,” said Frankie. “I can see how the
rules help keep people safe.”



54


55


56


They said good night, and her mom began
to close the door. Frankie called out, “Mom,
next week, can we play the Rule Detective game
again?”


Her mom smiled. “I’m glad to hear you
enjoyed it!”


From that day on, Frankie thought about
the reason behind the rules she had at school, at
the pool, in town, and at home. She liked how
rules allowed **plenty** of fun and joy and kept
everybody safer.

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully leveled
in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.

The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many spellings
can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to make early
reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of the available
spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out as part of their
phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been deliberately
introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if they are
assigned at the proper time.

As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.


TRICKY WORDS:


adventure, delicious, library, lifeguard


**Code Knowledge added gradually in the unit for this Reader:**


  - Decode multisyllabic words with vowel teams


  - Decode multisyllabic words with digraphs


  - Identify the meaning of words with affixes
