**Grade 3 | Foundational Skills 7**
##### Introduction


~~**UNIT 7 OVERVIEW**~~


This unit introduces and reviews several skills associated with sounds. It begins by introducing
diphthongs, moves to homophones and homographs, and ends with using suffixes to determine
meaning. Understanding these skills is important because they are very common in English and play a
significant role in pronunciation and vocabulary development.


Students will be introduced to the diphthongs /aw/, /ou/, and /oi/. Learning diphthongs builds
phonemic and phonological awareness.


Instruction on homophones and homographs develops accurate listening and reading skills, as they
help students recognize and understand words that may be confusing due to their similar sounds or
spellings. Students will identify, use, and explain the meaning of homographs, as well as practice spelling
homophones.


Students learn suffixes, such as _–able_ and _–ible_ . Suffixes modify the meanings of base words; this
knowledge is fundamental in word formation and vocabulary expansion, allowing for more precise
language use and better comprehension of complex texts.


~~**TRICKY SPELLINGS**~~


As new spellings are introduced, complexity is added to the reading process. Some of the spelling
units that students have to process are ambiguous in the sense that they can stand for more than
one sound. These ambiguous spellings are called “tricky spellings.” Earlier, in Unit 3, instruction
focused on split digraphs or VCe spellings. In Unit 5, students build on this concept by examining
how a consonant suffix, especially when attached to a base word that ends in silent ‘e’, changes
the spelling of the base word. In Unit 7, student will continuing learning about how to spell words
with suffixes that change the base word by dropping final ‘e,’ changing ‘y’ to ‘i,’ or doubling final
consonants. Also in Unit 7, students will spell multisyllabic words with diphthongs.


~~**TRICKY WORDS & HIGH-FREQUENCY WORDS**~~


Tricky Words are introduced in this unit on an as-needed basis in the context of the different
selections included in the Reader. Tricky Words should be taught in the lessons before the reading
selections are assigned. When introducing Tricky Words, be sure to draw attention to the parts that
are read (and spelled) just as students would expect based on what they have learned so far, and
also point out the tricky parts of each word.


Introduction
**1**


**2**



The Tricky Words taught in this unit are:


 - Lesson 1 - _accidental_


 - Lesson 2 - _breathe, patient, temperature_


 - Lesson 5 - _ancient_


 - Lesson 8 - _unusual_


 - Lesson 12 - _patrolling_


In addition to addressing Tricky Words and tricky spellings, this program emphasizes the reading
and spelling of high-frequency words, carefully selected from word lists compiled by researchers
Edward William Dolch and Edward Fry. The selection of these words was based on their prevalence
within the unit Reader, and instruction is integrated into lessons at points where students will
naturally encounter these words within the assigned sections of the Readers. The curriculum
includes a structured approach for teaching high-frequency words, starting with the introduction of
8–12 keywords at the beginning of each unit, selected for their relevance and frequency in the unit’s
text. Words are introduced using phonetic sounding and Spelling Cards for decoding. Throughout
the unit, these words are reviewed in various contexts, including through decode/encode games and
fluency checkpoints to assess automaticity and fluency. This ensures that students engage with the
words multiple times, enhancing their reading skills and confidence.


In addition to addressing Tricky Words and tricky spellings, this program emphasizes the reading
and spelling of high-frequency words carefully selected from word lists compiled by researchers
Edward William Dolch and Edward Fry. These lists are instrumental in aiding students, particularly
young learners, to become more proficient readers by focusing on words that frequently appear in
English reading materials.


The high-frequency words taught in this unit are:


 - Lesson 1 - _hurt_


 - Lesson 3 - _near_, _begin_


 - Lesson 5 - _both_, _start_


 - Lesson 6 - _above_


 - Lesson 8 - _once_


 - Lesson 10 - _example_


Foundational Skills 7


~~**READER: EVERYDAY HEROES**~~


The Unit 7 Reader highlights the unsung heroes in our communities—paramedics, firefighters, and
police officers. It emphasizes that these everyday heroes don’t wear capes but play crucial roles in
keeping us safe. The first chapter, “Paramedics,” traces the history of paramedics and their vital role
in providing emergency medical care outside hospitals. It explores their use of advanced technology
and the demanding life of a paramedic working 24–48-hour shifts. Chapter 2, “Firefighters,” delves
into the history of firefighting, emphasizing the dual role of many firefighters as trained paramedics.
It discusses the evolution of firefighting technology, including thermal cameras, drones, and
communication devices. The chapter also introduces wildland firefighters, who combat wildfires,
showcasing the diverse and challenging tasks firefighters undertake. A day in the life of a firefighter,
with its 24–48-hour shifts and rapid responses to emergencies, is highlighted. Chapter 3, “Police
Officers,” explores the historical development of police forces and their role in maintaining law and
order. It emphasizes the multifaceted responsibilities of police officers, from community engagement
to solving problems and promoting safety. The chapter provides insight into a day in the life of a police
officer, including patrolling, community events, and rapid responses to calls for help.


Each time students encounter a new section of text in the Reader, the lesson includes new
vocabulary words and/or phrases to accompany the section of text. There are lessons in which
students reread sections of the Reader, for the purpose of building fluency. These lessons do not
introduce new vocabulary or have a vocabulary chart.


~~**UNIT 7 ASSESSMENT**~~


**Formative Assessment and Additional Support**


Throughout this unit, formative assessments are clearly marked for monitoring individual student
performance and progress in key skills. Quick Checks for Understanding to evaluate classroom
performance as a whole are also designated in each lesson. Fluency practice takes place regularly
throughout the unit.


Records for recording student performance in an Anecdotal Reading Record, Grade 3 Foundational
Skills Record, Grade 3 Fluency Record, and Grade 3 End-of-Year Summary are included in the Teacher
Resources.


**Student Performance Assessment**


In Lessons 14 and 15, you will be prompted to administer a multipart end-of-unit assessment. In the
first part, you will work one-on-one with students to complete the Fluency Assessment. Students will
engage in a review activity while awaiting their turn for the assessment. The Reading and Spelling
portion of the assessment takes place during the first 20 minutes of the second lesson. Once students
have completed the assessment, they will have time for Self-Sustained Reading. Use time in this
lesson to finish working with students who still need to complete the Fluency Assessment in the
previous lesson.


Introduction
**3**


The target words in each of these assessments include the vowel sound/spellings taught in this
unit; distractors have been intentionally selected because they represent frequent sound/spelling
confusions. Student performance on these assessments is a good indicator of whether students have
mastered the new sound/spellings.


~~**REPEATED ROUTINES**~~


This unit strategically utilizes activities, games, and protocols from previous units to allow students to
practice new skills using familiar routines. Review and prepare for the following activities introduced in
previous units:


     - Speak and Spell


     - Pattern Wrap Up


     - Reading and Dictation


~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice Unit 1 skills can be found in the
Pausing Point section included after the last lesson. It is strongly recommended that you pause for
two days and provide targeted acceleration for individuals or groups of students in any areas in which
they require supplementation based on the Student Performance Assessment.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available on the program’s digital components
site. This component has been designed to complement the unit. It consists of poetry, folklore, and
fables. These additional text selections provide opportunities for students to practice reading with
fluency and prosody (expression). See the Unit 7 introduction or directions in the Fluency Supplement
for further guidance.

**physical trauma, n.,** any serious injury to the body
Example: The patient had undergone physical trauma as a result of crashing
his bike.


**standard, adj.,** regularly and widely used or supplied
Example: Chalkboards are standard equipment in school classrooms.


 - Conduct a brief discussion about the different words in the chart. For
example, show the words and ask students what prior knowledge they may
have about these words and where they might have seen them. Additionally,
have students decode any unfamiliar words and discuss the correct
pronunciation of each.


 - Model how to use the Glossary in the Reader to discover the pronunciation
and definition of words in bold. Review the definition together and ask
students to share their understanding of the word. Call on a few students to
share their thoughts.

- Remind students that most English words play by the rules, meaning they
are pronounced and spelled as we would expect. There are a few words that
do not play by the rules, including some very common and important ones.
Words that do not play by the rules (i.e., words not pronounced and spelled
as expected) are called “Tricky Words.”


- Display the Tricky Word, read it, and use it aloud in a sentence: _accidental_ .


- Point out which parts of the word are not regular and will either be taught
later or simply must be remembered.


  - Tricky Word: _accidental (explain that the first ‘c’ is pronounced /k/ and_


Foundational Skills 7


_the second ‘c’ is pronounced /s/)_


  - Invite students to share what they already know about the meaning of this
word. Other forms of the word such as accident and accidentally may be
easier for students to use in a sentence. If time, place students in small
groups to answer this question. Assign each person in the group a role, (e.g.,
facilitator, note-taker, speaker) to ensure each person has an opportunity to
contribute to learning.


  - Ask students to predict what the Reader might be about based on the title
and this tricky word.


  - Explain that _Everyday Heroes_ contains many high-frequency words. These
are common words, so they will come across them often as they read, in both
the Reader and in many different texts. Explain that learning to recognize
these words and how to spell them will improve their overall reading and
writing fluency.


  - Display this lesson’s high-frequency word: _hurt_ .


  - Focus on the word _hurt_ . Underline the letters _ur_ . Remind students that they
may have learned this r-controlled syllable makes the /er/ sound.


  - Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves: /h/ /er/ /t/. Clarify the meaning
of _hurt_ as needed. Invite students to turn to a partner and use the word in a
sentence.


  - Guide the class in reading the first part of Everyday Heroes, from “Do you
know. . .” to “. . .became a reality.” Model fluent reading when reading the first
couple of sentences by emphasizing clear articulation and smooth phrasing,
setting a benchmark for students to follow in their own reading practice.
Then assign students to read aloud the other paragraphs to the class while
their peers follow along.


  - Model how to use context to determine the meaning of an unfamiliar word
and to use the Glossary in the Reader to discover the pronunciation, part of
speech, and definition of words in bold.


  - Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension. Have students listen
actively and ask relevant questions to clarify any information from the
Reader or strategic prompts. Example prompts include:


1. **Literal:** What have you previously learned about first responders?
_(Answers may vary, but should reflect understanding that first responders_
_help others when in need.)_


2. **Inferential** : What can you infer about President Lyndon B. Johnson
based on his actions after receiving the accident report? _(He wanted to_

_wise and thoughtful.)_


3. **Evaluative:** What did the report read by President Lyndon B. Johnson
help him realize? _(It made him realize that too many people were dying_
_each year from accidental injuries.)_


 - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses.
Provide students with the following prompts to support the discussion:


   - I learned that first responders. . .

   - Based on President Johnson’s actions, I can infer that. . .

   - The report helped President Johnson realize. . .


~~**PRACTICE WITH PATTERN WRAP UP (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Direct students to go back into the Reader, _Everyday Heroes,_ to search
for and list on a piece of paper seven words with the /aw/ sound in those
sections of the reader.


 - Have students share the words and display them on the board or chart
paper: _lawbreakers_, _because_, _automatically_, _awful_, _haunting_, _daunting_,
_traumas_ .


 - Read each word aloud. Direct students to echo you.


 - Ask students to circle the /aw/ diphthong in each word, and then explain how
each word follows the spelling rules for the /aw/ diphthongs introduced in
the lesson, or identify if the word is an exception to the rules.


 - Write the following sentence frame on the board for students to use as they
answer questions about spelling: “The word _____ follows the /aw/ spelling
pattern because _____.”


 - Have students turn to a partner and take turns using each word in a
sentence. Circulate and monitor, offering support for any words students
may not understand the meaning of.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**

  - Consider clarifying that not all /aw/ diphthongs follow the rules. For example, if
the /aw/ diphthong comes at the very beginning of a word, it is usually spelled
_au_, as in the case of _audio_ or _auburn_, even if in these cases the diphthong is
found at the end of the first syllable of the word. However, the word _awesome_
uses the _aw_ spelling, even though the /aw/ sound is in the middle of the first
syllable.


**Foundational Skills**

  - Prepare to display Spell Words with Diphthong /aw/> _aw_, _au_ .


  - Write the following words on index cards: _August, sprawling, haunted,_
_lawbreaker, auburn_ .


**Reading**

  - Preview the section of the Reader that will be read during this lesson to model
fluent paragraph reading and using the Glossary to discover the pronunciation

~~**READ EVERYDAY HEROES**~~


  - Before reading, have students discuss with a turn and talk partner about
what they remember reading from the previous lesson. Students should
utilize the sentence stems: “Paramedics can. . .”, “Paramedics have. . .”, and
“Paramedics are. . .”


  - Explain that students will reread the previous section of their Reader,
_Everyday Heroes._ Tell students that today’s reading will be focused on
fluency, which is rate (appropriate pace), accuracy (reading words correctly),
and prosody (using phrasing and intonation to convey meaning).


  - Review the following vocabulary words that students will encounter in this
section of the Reader. Have students work with a partner to decode the
words in isolation and divide the words into syllables. Go over the correct
pronunciation of each word.


**assess, v.,** to form an opinion about the importance, ability, or value of
Example: When the paramedics arrive at the scene, they assess the situation
before taking action.


**overtime, n.,** time spent working beyond a set limit
Example: Many first responders are tasked to work overtime.


**shift**

**1. n.,** a scheduled period of work
Example: The first responders’ shift started at 9:00 am and ended at
5:00 am.


**TEKS 3.1.C** Speak coherently about the topic under discussion, employing eye contact, speaking rate, volume, enunciation,
and the conventions of language to communicate ideas effectively; **TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and

- Conduct a brief discussion about the meanings of the different words in the
chart. For example, show the words and ask students what prior knowledge
they may have about these words and where they might have seen them.
The multiple meanings of the word _shift_ will be explored in depth during
the reading of the story. Briefly explain them as you preview the vocabulary
chart.


- Model how to use the Glossary in the Reader to discover the pronunciation
and definition of words in bold. Review the definition together and ask
students to share their understanding of the word. Call on a few students to
share their thoughts.


- Direct students to reread from “The Life of a Paramedic” (pg. 14) to “…from
each other” (pg. 16, first paragraph). Note that students will be rereading
these pages so the vocabulary will be the same as the previous lesson, which
means there will be no new Vocabulary Chart for this section.


- Instruct students to read silently as you read the passage aloud.


Foundational Skills 7


 - Read a few sentences and model fluent reading for the students, using
intonation and expression. Adjust your pitch to emphasize important words
or ideas. This helps convey the meaning and emotion in the text. Use pauses
to signal transitions between ideas. Pauses allow students to process
information.


 - Ask the students to use a marker or finger to follow along with the text as
they read along with you.


 - Guide students in speaking coherently and evaluating the fluency of the
reading with the following prompts:


   - How was the pacing of the reading?

   - Did I read too quickly or slowly?

   - How can I adjust the pace to match the meaning of the text?


 - Direct students to read through “…their challenging work” (pg. 18).


 - Instruct all students to read aloud in unison and to focus on reading fluently.


 - Guide students in evaluating the fluency of the reading with the following prompts:


   - How smooth did your reading sound?

   - Were there any parts that felt choppy or hesitant?


 - As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual reading
ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record. Provide immediate and corrective
feedback such as, “Remember to adjust your pitch to emphasize important
words,” or “Great job pausing between paragraphs, that shows an
understanding of the text structure.”


 - After rereading “The Life of a Paramedic,” have students _Think-Pair-Share_
and retell what the chapter talked about in logical order. Use words like
_First…Next…Then…Last…_ (First it talked about the paramedics being first
responders in case of emergencies. Paramedics have many life saving skills
and tools that they use to help in these emergencies.)

- Display this lesson’s high-frequency words: _both_ and _start_ .


- Focus on the high-frequency word both. Underline the vowel. The _o_ in the
word both is pronounced as a long vowel sound in both. Blend sounds aloud
as you run your fingers under the word: /b/ /oe/ /th/. Clarify the meaning
of both as needed. Invite students to turn to a partner and use the word in a
sentence.


- Focus on the high frequency word start. Start is a good base word for adding
affixes like – _ed_ and – _ing_ . In the story _Everyday Heroes_, you will see start used
with these suffixes. Practice adding – _ing_ to start ( _starting_ ). And practice add

 - _ed_ ( _started_ ). Is there any other kind of affix you could add to start to make a
new word ( _restart_ ).


- Guide the class in reading from “The First Firefighters” to “. . .by the mid1900s.” Model fluent reading for a paragraph on page 20. Read at a natural
pace, not too fast or too slow. Vary your speed based on the content, slowing
down for important details or speeding up for less crucial information. Then
have students practice. Have students continue practicing reading at a
natural pace while reading aloud.


- Have students look back into the text and find the bolded vocabulary term. Use
context to determine the meaning of an unfamiliar word: _ancient._ Then have
students use the Glossary in the Reader to discover the pronunciation and find
out if their definition was correct.


- Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension. Have students listen
actively and ask relevant questions to clarify any information from the Reader
or strategic prompts. Example prompts include:


1. **Literal:** Why were the early firefighters called “bucket brigades”? _(they_
_deployed buckets of water on fires to douse them)_


2. **Literal:** What led to the creation of the first organized firefighting
brigades? _(The Great Fire of London)_


3. **Inferential:** What does _brigades_ mean in the sentence, “These groups, called
‘bucket brigades,’ deployed buckets of water to put out fires”? What words or
ideas in the text help you figure it out? _(It means a specific group, it talks about_
_this being a group of people who use buckets of water to douse fires.)_


- Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses
given the following sentence frames:


  - When I read the word _____ in the text, I imagined _____ in my mind.

  - Some similarities between firefighters and paramedics are _____.

  - Some differences between firefighters and paramedics are_____.

you took pauses between paragraphs to break up the text.”


~~**PRACTICE WITH PATTERN SEARCH (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Ensure each student has a whiteboard and dry erase marker.


 - Direct them to search for five words with the /oi/ sound in the section they just
read in _Everyday Heroes_, Chapter 2 “Firefighters.” Have students write the words
on their white boards. ( _poisonous, employed, deployed, appointed, destroying_ )


 - Display the words and ask them to add any that they may have missed:
_poisonous, employed, deployed, appointed, destroying_ .


 - Explain that all of these /oi/ words are multisyllabic words. To practice
decoding these words, students will break the words up using a dash mark
between syllables. Then circle the /oi/ sound.


 - Model one example to students using the word _poisonous_ . Read the word
aloud. Break the word up into syllables using dashes: _poi/son/ous_ . Circle the
oi in the first syllable. Say aloud that the /oi/ sound is spelt _oi_ because it is in
the first syllable.


 - Have students repeat steps with the next words individually on their
whiteboards. Read, separated into syllables using dashes and circle /oi/ sound.


_• em/ployed_


_• de/ployed_


_• ap/point/ed_


 - Ask students to explain how each word follows the rules for _oi_ diphthongs
learned earlier in the lesson, or identify if it’s an exception to the rules. _(When_
_you hear the /_ oi _/ sound at the beginning or in the middle of a syllable, it is_
_usually spelled_ oi _.)_

  - Instruct students to turn and talk about the _oi_ and _oy_ patterns in the words
_avoid_ and _annoy_ using the sentence frame: “In the word _____, the spelling
represents the sound _____. In the word _____, the _oy_ spelling represents the
sound _____. _”_


  - Remind students of the spelling rules learned in the previous lesson for the _oi_
diphthong: When you hear the /oi/ sound at the beginning or in the middle of
a syllable, it is usually spelled _oi_ . When you hear the /oi/ sound at the end of
a syllable, it is usually spelled _oy_ .


  - Ask: Why is the /oi/ sound spelled _oi_ in the word _avoid_ ? _(The /oi/ sound is in_
_the middle of the syllable.)_


  - Ask: Why is the /oi/ sound spelled _oy_ in the word _annoy_ ? _(The /oi/ sound is at_
_the end of the syllable.)_


  - Have students generate more multisyllabic words that include the /oi/
sound. Some words generated may have _oi_ or _oy_ . Sort through the words

discussing the Reader or strategic prompts, remind students to speak at
an appropriate rate and volume while maintaining eye contact. Example
prompts include:


1. **Literal:** How do thermal cameras help firefighters? _(they help locate the_
_fires even when it is smoke-filled)_


2. **Literal:** How do firefighters strategically utilize drones in the field? _(They_
_fly the drone over the fire to take an image. Firefighters can use that image_
_to help plan out how to put out the fire.)_


3. **Inferential:** Based on the information we learned about the Personal
Alert Safety System, what can you infer about the importance and
reasoning behind having the PASS? _(Sounds out an alarm if a firefighter_
_is not moving, which allows the team to know if someone is in danger.)_

4. **Evaluative:** After reading about all the tools firefighters use, what do you
think is the most useful tool and why? _(answers may vary)_


 - Ensure students speak coherently and draw evidence from the text to
support their responses given the following sentence stems:


   - From the information provided, I understand that _____.

   - In the text, it says that _____.


 - As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record. Provide immediate and
corrective feedback such as, “Remember to adjust your pitch to emphasize
important words,” or “Great job pausing between paragraphs, that shows an
understanding of the text structure.”


~~**PRACTICE WITH PATTERN WRAP UP (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Ensure each student has a whiteboard and dry erase marker.

these words, students will break the words up using a dash mark between
syllables. Then circle the /oi/ sound.


_• voy/a/ging_


_• de/void_


_• broi/ling_


 - Ask students to explain how each word follows the rules for _oi_ diphthongs
learned earlier in the lesson, or identify if it’s an exception to the rules. _(When_
_you hear the /oi/ sound at the beginning or in the middle of a syllable, it is_
_usually spelled_ oi _. When you hear the /oi/ sound at the end of a syllable, it is_
_usually spelled_ oy _.)_

~~**MORE HELP WITH HOMOGRAPHS**~~


**Play Roll It, Read It, Write It**

  - Move students into pairs. Provide each pair with one Roll It and Read It
Game Board (TR 14.1), one game piece, and one die.


  - Explain the game instructions:


    - One player rolls the die.

    - That player moves the game piece the number of spaces indicated by the
die number.


    - That player reads the homograph on the space they landed on. Then they
write one sentence using one meaning of that homograph.


    - The next player rolls the die and repeats the process with the same game
piece.


    - The first pair of students who get to the end of their game board with
correct sentences for each of the homographs they landed on is the
winning group.


    - If time permits, students can play multiple rounds.


  - Model how to play the game by following the steps for one turn.


    - Ask students to point to the word _second_ on their game boards.

    - Ask: What is a sentence we can write that uses one of the meanings of
the homograph, _second_ ?


    - Student: The basketball team won second place at the tournament.

    - Ask: What’s a sentence we can write that uses the other meaning of
_second_ ?


    - Student: You have one second left until the timer goes off.


    - Remind students that they should write their sentences in the lines
provided on Activity Page TR 14.1. Direct them to write in cursive,
leaving spaces between words.

  - Write the word _comfort_ on the board. Have students read it aloud.


  - Remind students that a suffix is a combination of letters added to the end of
a base word that changes the meaning of the word.


  - Point to _comfort_ and explain that it is a base word or a word that can stand on
its own.


  - Add the suffix _–able_ to the end of _comfort_ and ask students to read the new
word aloud ( _comfortable_ ).


  - Explain that the suffix _–able_ means “capable of,” “able to,” or “suitable for.” In
the case of the word _comfort_, it adds the meaning “capable of comfort.”


  - Explain that this suffix is used to turn a noun into an adjective. Therefore, when
you add _–able_ to the noun _comfort_, it turns it into the adjective _comfortable_,
which describes a place or thing that is capable of giving comfort.


  - Tell students that there are two suffixes with this meaning: _–able_ and _–ible_ .
Explain that there are different spelling rules for each suffix.

students will fill in the sentences with the correct word from the word bank.


 - Direct students to the first word. Ask: What suffix would we add to the base
_depend_ ? _(–able)_


 - Ask: How do we know? (It should be spelled using the _–able_ suffix because
when you remove the suffix, you’re left with a complete base word, _depend_ .)


 - Remind students of the meaning of the suffixes _–able_ and _–ible_, which will help
them determine the meaning of each word in the second part of activity page 12.1.


 - Release students to complete activity page 12.1.


 - Remind students to write neatly in cursive. Circulate and monitor to check

 - Model how to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words, for
example the word _feasible. (The word must mean if it is possible because it is_
_talking about different modes of possible transportation for police officers.)_


 - Choose strategic pausing points to check for comprehension. When
discussing the Reader or strategic prompts, remind students to speak at
an appropriate rate and volume while maintaining eye contact. Example
prompts include:


1. **Inferential:** In which ways do police officers interact with the community
to help solve community problems? _(by making sure people are learning_
_and following the laws)_


2. **Inferential:** Look at the word _feasible_ in this sentence, “Each day involves
patrolling the streets by car, bike, or foot—or sometimes even by horse if
it’s feasible!” Use the context in this sentence to determine the meaning
of _feasible_ . _(When something is likely to happen. In this sentence it is_
_saying that police have lots of options but they could travel by horse.)_


3. **Literal** : What does a police officer do during a typical day? _(meetings,_
_patrolling, community events, and responding to radio calls)_


4. **Evaluative** : In what ways do police officers patrolling benefit the
community? _(keeps a watchful eye on the community and lets people_
_know you are available to lend a helping hand)_


 - Ensure students speak coherently and draw evidence from the text to
support their responses given the following sentence frames:


   - An important part to consider is _____.

   - It helps by ______ and _____.

such as _fish_ and _radish_, don’t contain the same suffix that means ‘somewhat,’
‘similar to,’ or ‘related to.’ Remind students that the suffix _–ish_ is added to
a noun to turn it into an adjective and that nouns or verbs that end in _–ish_
would not be examples of words with the _–ish_ suffix.

~~**REVIEW THE SUFFIXES –ABLE AND –IBLE AND INTRODUCE THE**~~
~~**SUFFIX –ISH (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Display Spelling Rules for Suffixes _–able_ and _–ible_ from Lesson 12 (Digital
Component 12.1). Have students turn and talk about Lesson 12 suffixes.
Today we are going to review past suffixes and introduce a new suffix _–ish_ .


 - Ask students, “Using our spelling rules, is the word _terrible_ spelled with the

_–able_ or _–ible_ suffix?” _(the –ible suffix)_


 - Ask students, “What rule does this follow?” _(It follows the rule “Often if you_
_take away –ible, you are not left with a complete base word.” In this case, if you_
_take away –ible, you would be left with ‘terr’, which isn’t a complete word.)_


 - Ask students, “Using these rules, is the word _manageable_ spelled with the _–_
_able_ or _–ible_ suffix?” _(the –able suffix)_


 - Ask students, “What rule does this follow?” _(It follows the rule “If you take_
_away –able, you are usually left with a complete base word.” If you take away_

_–able, you are left with ‘manage,’ which is a complete word.)_


 - Remind students that they can use the suffixes _–able_ and _–ible_ to determine
the meaning of a word. If the suffix _–able_ means “capable of,” “able to,” or
“suitable for,” then _manageable_ means “able to be managed.”


 - Write the word _babyish_ on the board and underline the suffix _–ish_ .


 - Explain that today students will learn about another suffix, _–ish_ . Point to
_babyish_ and direct students to read the word aloud.


 - Tell students that the suffix _–ish_ means “somewhat,” “like,” or “related to.”
Like _–able_ and _–ible_, the suffix _–ish_ is added to a noun to turn it into an
adjective. When you add _–ish_ to the word _baby_, it means “like a baby.”


 - Explain that the suffix _–ish_ is almost always added to the end of the word
without changing the spelling of that word.


 - Have students create a list of words that end with _–ish_ . Think of words with
two syllables or more that include _–ish_ .


~~**USE SUFFIXES –ABLE, –IBLE, AND –ISH (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Direct students to Activity Page 13.1.


 - Complete the sentences with the correct word from the word bank. Remind
students to write their responses in cursive.

    - For the homophone and homograph game board, the player creates a
sentence using the homophone or homograph they landed on and writes
the sentence in Activity Page 14.1. If the player lands on a homograph,
they should write two sentences: one for each meaning of the
homograph. Remind students to write their sentences in cursive, leaving
spaces between words.


    - The student who arrives at the end of the game board first wins.


    - Students can play multiple rounds if time permits, as long as they are
spending ten minutes with each game board.


~~**SELF-SUSTAINED READING (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Students will be reading independently and quietly while peers continue to

students about the high
frequency words and tricky
words that they have been
learning.



Lesson 14 Fluency Assessment
**137**


Activity Pages
14.2, 14.3



~~**FLUENCY ASSESSMENT (30 MIN.)**~~


You will work individually with each student and take a running record of the
student’s oral reading of a text. For this assessment, you will take a simple,
easily calculated measure of the student’s fluency by seeing how long it
takes the student to read the text. Allow each student three minutes to
read the story. Students with proficient fluency should be able to complete
the text in this amount of time. Instruct students to speak coherently and
complete the comprehension questions after reading the text.


 - Have one student at a time come to a quiet assessment area to read “Maya
and the Monster” with you.


 - Ask the student for Activity Page 14.2 (Fluency Assessment) and Activity
Page 14.3 (Fluency Assessment Questions).


 - Tell the student that you are going to ask him or her to read the story aloud.


 - Explain that you are going to use a watch to see how long it takes them to
read the story. Tell the student that this is not a race; they should read at
their regular pace and not rush.


 - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the title. If you are
using a watch, write the exact Start Time, in minutes and seconds, on your
record page.


 - If you are using a stopwatch, you do not need to write down the start time
since the stopwatch will calculate Elapsed Time.


 - As the student reads the story, make a running record on the copy with the
student’s name using the following guidelines:

|Words Read Correctly|No mark is required.|
|---|---|
|**Omissions**|Draw a long dash above the word omitted.|
|**Insertions**|Write a caret (^) at the point where the insertion<br>was made.<br>If you have time, write down the word that was<br>inserted.<br>|
|**Words Read Incorrectly**|Write an ‘X’ above the word.|
|**Substitutions**|Write the substitution above the word.|
|**Self-Corrected Errors**|Replace original error mark with an ‘SC.’|
|**Teacher-Supplied Words**|Write a ‘T’ above the word (counts as an error).|



Foundational Skills 7



**138**


- When the student finishes reading the story, write the exact Finish Time in
minutes and seconds on your record sheet.


- Alternatively, if you are using a stopwatch, simply write down the Elapsed
Time in minutes and seconds.


- If the student reads very slowly, you may need to stop the reading before the
student gets to the end of the story. (Five minutes should be enough time to
get a measurement.) If the student does not read to the end, draw a vertical
line on the record sheet to indicate how far the student read. Also write down
either the Finish Time or the Elapsed Time.


- Repeat this process for additional students.


Activity Page 14.3: Fluency Assessment


   - If the reading was fairly accurate (<10 uncorrected errors), you can
get a rough (and easy) estimate of a student’s W.C.P.M. score simply
by noting the time and looking at the chart on the Unit 7 W.C.P.M.
Calculation Sheet.


   - To calculate a student’s exact W.C.P.M. score, follow the described
steps.


     - First, complete the Words section of the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.

     - Count Words Read. This is the total number of words that the
student read or attempted to read, up to the point where they
stopped. It includes words that the student read correctly as well
as words that the student read incorrectly or skipped over. If the
student attempted to read the whole story, including the title, use
288 words as your total. If the student did not finish the story, you
will need to count the number of words that the student actually
attempted to read. Write the count for Words Read in the matching
box on the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


     - Count the Uncorrected Mistakes noted in your running record.
This includes words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and
words that you had to supply. Write the total in the box labeled
Uncorrected Mistakes. (A mistake that is corrected by the student is
not counted as a mistake; the student is penalized for the time he or
she lost making the correction, but not for the initial mistake.)


     - Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get Words
Correct.



Challenge


Invite students to write
and read aloud a speech
highlighting the positive
contributions of first
responders in their
communities.



Lesson 14 Fluency Assessment
**139**


  - Next, complete the Time section of the activity page.

  - Calculate Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a
stopwatch, this should already be done for you. Skip to the next
step.) If you used a watch and recorded start and stop times,
you will need to subtract the Start Time from the Finish Time to
calculate the Elapsed Time. Subtract seconds from seconds then
minutes from minutes. Calculate Time in Seconds. Multiply the
number of minutes by 60 to convert minutes to seconds, and then
add the number of seconds.


  - Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then multiply by 60 to
get Words Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.).


- As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider:


  - It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in
W.C.P.M. scores. However, a major goal for Grade 3 students is
to read with sufficient fluency to ensure comprehension and
independent reading of school assignments in subsequent grades.
Exact fluency targets vary from state to state; the national mean
calculated by Hasbrouck and Tindal in 2017 for Winter of Grade 3 is
97 W.C.P.M.


  - A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared with the score of other
students in the classroom (or grade level) and also with the national
fluency norms for Winter of Grade 3 obtained by Hasbrouck and
Tindal. Students whose scores are below the 25th percentile (79
W.C.P.M), are experiencing serious problems in reading fluently.


- Compare the student’s W.C.P.M. score to national norms for Winter of
Grade 3 (Hasbrouck and Tindal, 2017):






|Reading Time for<br>this Text|W.C.P.M.|National Percentiles<br>for Winter, Grade 3|
|---|---|---|
|2:35|161|90th|
|3:05|137|75th|
|4:05|97|50th|
|5:55|79|25th|
|8:00|62|10th|



**140**




   - After you have entered each student’s scores on the W.C.P.M
Calculation Sheet, record them on the Grade 3 End-of-Year Summary
for each student.

  - Explain the game instructions:


    - One player rolls the die.

    - That player moves the game piece the number of spaces indicated by the
die number.


    - That player reads the homograph on the space they landed on. Then they
write one sentence using one meaning of that homograph while their
partner writes a sentence using the other meaning of the homograph, on
Activity Page 14.1.


    - The next player rolls the die and repeats the process with the same game
piece.


    - The first pair of students who get to the end of their game board with
correct sentences for each of the homographs they landed on is the

_are, too, two, to, witch, which._


  - Direct students to write words from the list on the board in any order in the
nine squares on their blank bingo boards. Remind them to write a different
word in each square.


  - Explain the game instructions:


    - Students will listen carefully as you read a sentence using a homophone.

    - If that homophone is on their game board, they will cover it with their
bingo piece.


    - The first student to correctly identify a row of three homophones—either
vertically, horizontally, or diagonally—on their bingo board will win the
game.


    - Remind students that to identify the correct spelling of the homophone
on their bingo board, they have to listen closely to how it is used in the
sentence.


  - Model how to play by reading the following sentence: _We went to visit_
_some friends at their house._ Write _their_ on the board and explain that in
this sentence, _their_ refers to the house of our friends and is a possessive
pronoun, so it is spelled _their_, not _they’re_ or _there_ . Direct students to cover
_their_ with a game piece if they have it on their bingo board.

the word itself or any part of it.


  - Set a time limit for each round, typically one to two minutes. If the word is not
guessed within the time limit, the turn ends.


  - You may choose to have students use white boards and markers to write
down and spell the word once it is revealed orally.

###### Grade 3 Foundational Skills Record

Teacher Instructions: Create one copy of the Foundational Skills Record per student. Use assessments
within the unit to track the student’s progress toward mastery of each standard. Use the rating system
to indicate the level of teacher support required and the space provided to take notes.


  - Students at level 1 require focused instruction to accelerate learning in a specific area. Use the
Additional Supports and Pausing Points to target areas of growth.


  - Students at levels 2 and 3 should be showing steady growth. These students would benefit from the
Take-Home Materials and side-bar support suggestions within each lesson.


  - Students at level 4 are excelling. Use the side-bar challenge suggestions to increase rigor.

###### Grade 3 Fluency Record

Choose texts from the Grade 3 Fluency Packet or the Unit Readers for students to read aloud
as you measure their pace and accuracy. Subtract the Words Missed (words that are omitted,
mispronounced, or substituted for another word) from the Total Words in Text to determine the
number of Words Read Correctly. Divide the Words Read Correctly by the Total Words in Text to
determine the students’ accuracy. Record how long it takes the students to read the passage to
determine their Words Per Minute. Consider both accuracy and pace as well as expression when
evaluating a student’s overall fluency.

The number of words read correctly indicates the following:


 - Students who score 6 or fewer words out of 10 words correctly have minimal preparation for the next unit.


 - Students who score 7 out of 10 words correctly have adequate preparation for the next unit.


 - Students who score 8 or more words out of 10 words correctly have outstanding preparation for the next unit.


After scoring the assessment, you might find it helpful to
determine which phonemes students missed that caused

**Appendix A:**
##### Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program


~~**THE SIMPLE VIEW OF READING**~~


Virtually everyone who writes about reading now recognizes that reading comprehension requires
more than just decoding ability. Many reading researchers now subscribe to a view of reading that is
known as “the simple view of reading.” This view, which is associated with reading researchers Philip
Gough and William Tunmer, holds that there are two chief elements that are crucially important to
reading comprehension: decoding skills and language comprehension ability.


To achieve reading comprehension, a person needs to be able to decode the words on the page and
then make sense of those words. The first task is made possible by decoding skills and the second
by language comprehension ability. If the person cannot decode the words on the page, he or she
will not be able to achieve reading comprehension, no matter how much oral language he or she
can understand. Even if the person can decode the words on the page, that in and of itself is still no
guarantee of reading comprehension. Thus, if a person cannot understand sentences when they
hear them, they are unlikely to understand those sentences when reading.


Supporters of the simple view—and there are a growing number of them among reading
researchers—argue that a person’s reading comprehension ability can be predicted, with a high
degree of accuracy, based on two basic measures. The first is a measure of decoding skills (e.g.,
a test of single-word reading or pseudo-word reading). The second is a measure of listening
comprehension. Researchers who hold to the simple view say, “Tell me a person’s decoding ability,
as ascertained by a word-reading task, and tell me that person’s language comprehension ability,
as ascertained by a listening comprehension task, and I can make a very accurate prediction of
that person’s reading comprehension ability.” If the person is an efficient and accurate decoder and
also able to understand a wide range of oral language—for instance, classroom presentations, news
items on the radio or TV, books on tape, etc.—then it is a safe bet the person will also do well on
tests of reading comprehension.


An interesting thing about the simple view of reading is that it can be expressed as an equation:





In this equation, each of the letters is a variable that stands for a specific skill:


R is a measure of reading comprehension ability.



**224**



Foundational Skills 7


D is a measure of decoding skills.


C is a measure of language-comprehension ability as measured using a listening task.


Each of these skills can be quantified as a numerical value between 0 and 1, where 0 stands for no
ability whatsoever and 1 stands for perfect, not-to-be-improved-upon ability. Most people have a
skill level that falls somewhere between these two extremes.


The equation says that if you have some decoding ability (D > 0) and you also have some language
comprehension ability (C > 0), you will probably also have some reading comprehension ability (R >
0). How much reading comprehension ability you have will depend on the exact values of D and C.


What does it mean to have no decoding ability (D = 0)? It means you cannot turn printed words into
spoken words. A person who cannot decode letters on a page cannot read. The person is illiterate.


What does it mean to have no language comprehension ability (C = 0)? It means you do not know
the language, and you cannot understand any of it when you hear other people speaking or reading
aloud in that language.


It is not very common for a person to have decoding ability (D > 0) but not language comprehension
ability (C = 0). Why would you learn to read and write a language you cannot understand? It does
happen. One famous example involves the English poet John Milton, the author of _Paradise Lost_ and
other well-known poems. Milton went blind late in life. Since Braille had not yet been invented, this
meant he could not read for himself. Nevertheless, Milton found a way to keep learning from books:
he had friends and relatives read the books aloud for him. However, he was not always able to find
a scholar who had the free time and the ability needed to read to him in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and
other ancient languages. The solution? Milton taught his daughters to decode these languages so
they could read books in those languages aloud to him. Milton did not teach his daughters the actual
languages—the thousands of words and tens of thousands of meanings. That would have been a
difficult, time-consuming task. He only taught them the rules they would need to turn letters into
sounds. Thus, his daughters acquired solid decoding skills for these languages (D > 0), but they
would have scored a zero on any measure of language comprehension (C = 0). They could turn
symbols into sounds, but they had no idea what the sounds meant. Milton, on the other hand, due
to his blindness, had no functional decoding skills (D = 0). However, by virtue of his great learning,
he was able to understand Hebrew, Latin, and Greek when they were read aloud to him (C > 0).
Between Milton and his daughters, you might say, there was reading comprehension (R), but the
younger generation brought the decoding skills (D) and the elderly poet brought the language
comprehension (C).


The Milton example is an unusual one, but it is possible to give a less unusual one. A decent teacher
can teach you to decode Russian letters (or the letters used in many other writing systems) in the


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program
**225**


**226**



course of a couple days of intensive work. Since you already know a lot about reading, all you would
need to learn is which sound values the unfamiliar letters stand for. Once you learned that, you
would be able to sound out most of the words in the language, but nobody would claim that you are
reading Russian. You would have some rudimentary decoding skills (D > 0), but you would be lacking
language comprehension (C = 0). You would be able to pronounce words, but you would not be able
to make sense of them. Essentially, you would be doing what Milton’s daughters did.


~~**HOW THESE IDEAS INFORM THIS PROGRAM**~~


Although this may seem very abstract and theoretical, there are two ideas here that are very
important for reading instruction and for understanding this program. The first important idea
is that reading comprehension depends crucially on both decoding skills (D) and language
comprehension ability (C); the second is that language comprehension ability takes much longer to
acquire than decoding skills.


Milton chose to teach his daughters decoding skills because he could teach those relatively quickly.
It would have taken him much, much longer to build up their language comprehension abilities.
Likewise, in the hypothetical example just given, a decent teacher could teach you to decode
Russian print in a few days of intensive instruction, but he or she would need to keep working with
you for many weeks—possibly even many years—to teach you enough Russian words and phrases to
understand a movie, make sense of a radio report, or read a short story.


You are facing a similar situation as a teacher in the early grades. You want your students to learn
to read. A crucial first step is to teach them decoding skills. Strong decoding skills can be taught
to most young children throughout Grades K–3. It takes longer to teach decoding skills to young
children who are learning to read for the first time than it does to teach the same skills to adults
who have already learned to read in another language, and it takes longer to teach decoding skills in
English-speaking countries because English spelling is rather complex; but even so, most students
can acquire basic decoding ability in the early grades. The children will continue to automatize their
decoding skills, learn new spelling patterns, and build fluency for many more years, but the basics
can be taught in Grades K–3.


That is not the case with language comprehension ability. It is going to take you and your school
system a long time to build up your students’ language comprehension ability because this is not a
job you can accomplish in the course of a single school year. Rather, language comprehension ability
is acquired over many years. Your students began to develop a rudimentary ability to understand
language even before they could speak and continued to increase their language comprehension
abilities throughout the preschool years. They will make even more gains in your classroom and the
classrooms they join after yours. With each new sentence they read or hear, and each new subject
they study in school, they will be building up background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural
literacy, thus increasing the range of materials they are equipped to understand, first orally and later


Foundational Skills 7


via reading. The more you teach them and the more you expose them to, the more they will be able
to understand. It takes a long time to build up the vocabulary and knowledge needed to make sense
of most stories in a newspaper or magazine, but this buildup is crucial for your students’ reading
abilities: no matter how good their decoding skills may be, they will not understand what they read
unless they have the language comprehension ability to make sense of the words they decode.


The program includes two strands of instruction, and these strands correspond with the elements of
reading isolated in the simple view of reading. The Skills Strand is meant to build students’ decoding
skills (D), while the Knowledge Strand is meant to build students’ language comprehension ability
(C) by exposing them to vocabulary, concepts, and ideas through frequent reading aloud. It is
important to understand that both strands are crucial for reading comprehension in later grades.
You may feel the decoding skills taught in the Skills Strand are more important to teach in the early
grades, and certainly, this is the area where you can expect to have the most immediate impact,
but it is important that you not neglect language comprehension ability. Remember, it takes many
years to build up enough vocabulary and general knowledge to understand a wide range of printed
materials. The building of background knowledge needs to begin in Kindergarten (if not before) and
continue throughout the elementary and middle school years.


If students are not building their language comprehension ability in the early grades, their reading
scores are likely to begin to fall off in Grade 4 and later. This has been called the “fourth-grade
slump,” and it occurs because material assessed on reading tests changes over time. As students
progress through the grades, test questions focus less on rudimentary decoding skills and more
on comprehension—and comprehension depends on having sufficient vocabulary, background
knowledge, and cultural literacy to understand the words you are decoding. Thus, the importance
of language comprehension ability increases with time. A weakness in this area may not show up on
tests in early grades, but it will show up in later elementary grades.


This has been well documented in research. In one very interesting study, researchers at the
University of Kansas looked at measurements of reading comprehension (R), decoding/word
recognition (D), and listening comprehension (C) for the same 570 students in the second, fourth,
and eighth grades. They found the two factors D and C accurately predicted R in each grade
but that C became more important, in the sense that it explained more of the variation among
students over time. The measure of decoding (D) was extremely important in the second-grade
results. Twenty-seven percent of the variance in reading comprehension in second grade could be
explained by decoding skills (D) alone. Only 9 percent of the variance could be explained by listening
comprehension (C) alone. By fourth grade, however, the measure of listening comprehension
had begun to account for more variance: the unique contribution of C rose to 21 percent, while
the equivalent number for D fell. By eighth grade, fully 36 percent of the variance in reading
comprehension scores could be explained with reference to the children’s listening comprehension
ability. The unique contribution of D sank even further. In other words, while reading comprehension
depended on D and C at every stage, as the simple view would predict, C explained more and more


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program
**227**


**228**



of the variation among students as time went by. What this tells us is that, once the intricacies of
decoding are mastered (and in English, this takes some time), reading comprehension depends
more and more heavily on language comprehension. Language comprehension depends on
background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural literacy.


~~**TWO MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT READING AND WRITING**~~


The Skills Strand teaches the mechanics of both reading and writing. It is based on the most current
research on reading and writing, but at the same time, it has been written in opposition to some ideas
that have been very influential in elementary education in recent decades. Two of those ideas are:


 - Learning to read and write is natural.


 - Learning to read and write is easy.


Both of these ideas have great emotional appeal. Unfortunately, both of them are wrong.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT NATURAL**~~


Many scholars have argued that spoken language is natural for human beings. The cognitive
scientist Stephen Pinker, for example, has argued that human beings have a language instinct,
meaning that humans are born with an innate capacity for learning language. This may turn out to
be true. It is at least a plausible theory since historians, linguists, and anthropologists have never
found a human culture that does not use language. When something is universal, it may turn out to
be natural.


What is true of oral language is not necessarily true of written language. In fact, with written
language, we know we are dealing with something that is not natural or innate because we know
when and where writing was invented, and we know that, even today, not all languages have a
system of writing. There are still hundreds of languages in the world that are spoken but not written
or read.


Ten thousand years ago this was the norm rather than an exception. At that time, there were
probably no human beings who knew how to read or write. According to the linguist Florian
Coulmas, the idea of writing down language was probably developed independently by three ancient
cultures: the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, and the Chinese. Each used a slightly different system, and
the mechanisms these pioneers developed for recording speech then spread from one culture to
another, evolving as they went. If these initial inventors had not come up with schemes for writing
down speech, we might all be illiterate today.


Writing is many things. It is an art that can be taught and learned. It is an invention—one of the
greatest inventions in human history. It is a technology enabling us to do things we could not do


Foundational Skills 7


without it—a technology every bit as exciting and amazing as airplane flight or electric power. But
it is not natural. The same is true of reading, which is simply the process of unpacking, or decoding,
what somebody else has written.


Reading and writing are both highly artificial. We tend to recoil at that word. We have internalized the
idea that natural is good and artificial is bad. Therefore, we think, reading must be natural. In fact, as
the reading researcher Philip Gough has written, reading is a highly unnatural act.


The first step toward good reading and writing instruction is to understand that reading and writing
are artificial—but not necessarily in a bad sense. We need to remind ourselves that the word _artificial_
derives from the word _art_ . To say reading and writing are forms of art that had to be invented and
need to be taught to children does not make reading and writing any less wonderful or important.
On the contrary, it makes these things more wonderful and precious, and it also emphasizes the
importance of your job as a teacher. There is no job more important than teaching young children
the magnificent, valuable, and highly unnatural arts of reading and writing.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT EASY**~~


The second idea noted earlier, that learning to read and write is easy, is also mistaken. Reading and
writing are complex behaviors, and they are more complex in English than in many other languages
because English has a fairly complicated spelling system. In Spanish, for example, the relationships
between letters and sounds are mostly one-to-one, meaning each sound is usually written with
one spelling, and each spelling unit is usually pronounced one way. This is not the case in English.
To read and write English with a high degree of accuracy, there is quite a lot that students need to
learn.


As a way of demonstrating the complexity involved in learning to read and write in English, suppose
we attempted to list all the discrete bits of information a person needs to know in order to be able
to read and write in English. As a starting point, we might begin with the 26 letters and argue that
these are the 26 things one really needs to learn to read and write English. However, for each letter,
one eventually needs to learn not only the letter shape but also the letter name (to be able to read
abbreviations and initials). So that is 52 bits of information.


That is a good start, but we must not stop there. In English, all letters can be written in uppercase
and lowercase forms, and the uppercase forms are not always the same as the lowercase forms.
Compare ‘B’ to ‘b,’ ‘D’ to ‘d,’ ‘H’ to ‘h,’ ‘R’ to ‘r,’ and ‘Q’ to ‘q.’ At least 16 uppercase letters have a slightly
different form than the matching lowercase letters. So we must raise our estimate of the complexity
of the English writing system to 68 bits of information.


We are not done yet. Students must also know the 44 sounds these letters stand for. That raises our
estimate of the complexity to 112.


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program
**229**


**230**



If there were a simple one-to-one relationship between letters and sounds, that might be a fairly
good estimate of the complexity of the code. Unfortunately, the relationships between sounds and
letters in English are quite complicated. The 44 sounds of English can be spelled many different
ways. In our work on this program, we have identified 150 spellings that are frequent enough to be
worth teaching in the early grades. That boosts our estimate of the complexity of the code to 262.


In addition, students need to learn to track from left to right, blend sounds into words (when
reading), and segment words into sounds (when writing and spelling). They need to learn a handful
of symbols used in writing, including the period, comma, exclamation point, question mark,
quotation mark, and apostrophe. That raises our estimate of code complexity to about 270 bits of
information.


We could boost the estimate even higher by adding Tricky Words and unusual spellings or by
pointing out that many letters in English can be pronounced in different ways. We could also point
out that reading a word like _thin_ requires students to group the first two letters and attach them to
one sound, and reading a word like _cake_ requires students to scan ahead, see the ‘e,’ and realize it
controls the pronunciation of the ‘a’ earlier.


Even without these additions, it is clear that the English writing system is quite complicated.


~~**THE PROBLEM WITH WHOLE LANGUAGE**~~


On a conservative estimate, there are 270 bits of knowledge a person needs to be able to read and
write English. It is unwise to ask students to tackle all this complexity at once and hope they will
figure it out. Yet that is precisely what is done in so-called “Whole Language” approaches. Whole
Language instruction is based on the assumption that learning to read is natural and not difficult,
so reading skills can be allowed to develop gradually, without much explicit instruction. Lots of
students in Whole Language classrooms do manage to figure out the English writing system, but
many others do not. Whole Language ideas have tremendous emotional appeal, but the Whole
Language approach is actually a recipe for _leaving many children behind_ . It is an especially risky
strategy for disadvantaged children.


A much better strategy is to introduce the English spelling code explicitly, beginning with the
easiest, least ambiguous, and most frequently used parts of the code and then adding complexity
gradually. That is the central strategy on which this program is based.


The strategy adopted in this program is the same strategy that successful coaches use when
teaching children a sport such as tennis. The successful coach does not ask students to learn
“Whole Tennis” and soak up the necessary skills all at once by trying to hit all different kinds of
shots the first day on the court. Instead, the successful coach teaches the student to hit a forehand
ground stroke and provides lots of practice hitting forehands. Then the coach moves on to teach


Foundational Skills 7


a backhand ground stroke, then a forehand volley, then a backhand volley, then a serve, then an
overhead smash, then a drop shot, etc. With each element taught, the student becomes a stronger
and more complete player. In the same way, this program begins by teaching the most common and
least ambiguous spellings for sounds and then moves on to introduce the more complex parts of the
writing system.


~~**KEY ASPECTS OF THE SKILLS STRAND**~~


Some key aspects of the Skills Strand are listed below.


  - This program teaches reading and writing in tandem, since they are inverse processes. English
writing involves making pictures of sounds; reading involves translating those pictures back into
sounds and blending the sounds to make words.


  - This program includes explicit, systematic phonic instruction in which students are taught target
skills needed to independently decode and encode words.


  - This program explicitly teaches letter-sound correspondences as opposed to leaving students to
figure these out on their own or deduce them by analyzing familiar whole words (as in some forms of
“analytic” phonics).


  - This program focuses on sounds, or phonemes, as the primary organizing principle of the program,
rather than letters.


  - This program focuses consistently on the phoneme, or single sound, and not on larger units.
Students learn to read words that contain onsets, rimes, and consonant clusters, but they learn to
view and process these larger units as combinations of smaller phoneme-level units. Rimes like _–ick_
and initial clusters like _st–_ are not taught as units but as combinations.


  - This program uses a synthetic phonics approach that teaches students to read by blending through
the whole word; it does not teach multiple cueing strategies, use of pictures as a primary resource in
decoding, or part-word guessing.


  - This program begins by teaching the most common or least ambiguous spelling for a sound (the
basic code spelling); later it teaches spelling alternatives for sounds that can be spelled several
different ways. Thus, the system is kept simple at first, and complexity is added bit by bit as students
gain confidence and automatize their reading and writing skills.


  - This program includes words, phrases, and stories for students to read and activity pages for them to
complete that allow for focused, distributed practice working with the letter-sound correspondences
they have been taught.


  - This program does not require students to read words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have learned. In other words, all words students are asked to read as
part of the program are decodable, either because they are composed entirely of letter-sound


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program
**231**


**232**



correspondences students have been taught or because they are Tricky Words that have been
taught. This means students have a chance to begin reading words and stories that are completely
decodable before tackling words and stories that are full of spelling alternatives.


 - This program does not require students to write words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have been taught. In other words, students are only asked to write words that
can be spelled (at least plausibly if not always correctly) using the code knowledge they have been
taught.


 - This program carefully controls the introduction of Tricky Words and words with ambiguous or rare
spellings, preferring to have students learn to read and write with regular words that can be blended
and spelled by the letter-sound correspondences taught.


 - High-frequency words compiled from a research-based list for Grade 3 are also taught as they appear
in the unit Readers. They are revisited frequently to build automaticity and fluency.


 - This program avoids letter names because what is important for reading is not the letter name but
the sound value the letter stands for. To read the word _cat_, it is essential to know /k/ /a/ /t/, not “see
aay tee.”


~~**THE BASIC AND ADVANCED CODE**~~


The program teaches the highly complex letter-sound correspondences of the English language
in an explicit and systematic manner in Kindergarten–Grade 3. Students are taught how the 26
letters (or graphemes) of the alphabet are used in various combinations to represent 44 sounds (or
phonemes). There are approximately 150 different spellings for these sounds.


Students are first taught the basic code for each of the 44 phonemes. The basic code spelling for
a sound is usually the most common, or the least ambiguous, spelling for a sound. By learning
these letter-sound correspondences first, students experience a high degree of predictability, and
therefore success, in decoding words with these spellings.


Basic code spellings may be single letters, such as these spellings and sounds: ‘a’ > /a/, ‘e’ > /e/,
‘b’ > /b/, and ‘m’ > /m/. Basic code spellings may also include digraphs, or two letters to represent
a sound, such as ‘ee’ > /ee/, ‘oy’ > /oi/, ‘ou’ > /ow/, ‘sh’ > /sh/, and ‘th’ > /th/. Other basic code
spellings include separated digraphs, such as ‘a_e’ > /ae/, and ‘o_e’ > /oe/.


The advanced code consists of all other spelling alternatives (over 100) that may be used to spell
the 44 phonemes in English. Examples of alternative spellings include ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘ss’ > /s/, ‘c’

- /s/, ‘g’ > /j/, ‘ay’ > /ae/, and ‘ey’ > /ee/. Some of these spelling alternatives occur relatively
frequently in the English language, while others are quite rare. See the provided charts for the basic
and advanced code.

Foundational Skills 7


~~**TRICKY WORDS**~~


The term _Tricky Word_ is used in this program to refer to a word that does not “play by the rules” of
spelling and/or pronunciation. Examples of Tricky Words include _one_, _said_, _of_, _were_, and _have_ .


You can describe the trickiness of a Tricky Word like _said_ in two ways. If you think about it from a
spelling point of view, you might say that the word _said_ is tricky because the sound /e/ is not spelled
with an ‘e,’ as you might expect it would be. On the other hand, if you think about it from a reading
point of view, you might say the word is tricky because the letters ‘ai’ are not pronounced /ae/, as
you might expect they would be. Either way you look at it, _said_ is a Tricky Word.


But notice that the word is not completely irregular, either. The first letter and the last letter are
pronounced exactly as you would expect. It is only the second and third letters, representing the
vowel sound, that are not sounded as you would expect. Or, if you prefer to look at things from the
speller’s perspective, you might say the first and last sound are spelled just as you would expect; it
is only the middle sound—the vowel sound—that is spelled irregularly. This is the case with many
Tricky Words: most of them have a regular part (or parts) and then a tricky part. More often than
not, you will find that the tricky part involves the vowel sound and its spelling.


When you are asked to teach a Tricky Word, the guidelines in the Teacher Guide will generally prompt
you to begin by reminding students that not all words play by the rules and words that do not play
by the rules are called Tricky Words. Next, the Teacher Guide will generally suggest that you write
the Tricky Word on the board. You may wish to ask a student to read the word as he or she thinks it
might be sounded (i.e., to blend according to the normal procedures). Alternatively, you can read the
Tricky Word that way yourself. Then you can point out how the word is actually pronounced. Once
you have established the actual pronunciation, you can point out and/or discuss what is regular and
what is irregular about the word. Most Tricky Words have at least some parts pronounced exactly the
way you would expect. For example, as noted above, the first and last letter in _said_ are pronounced
just as one would expect. After discussing the regular parts, you should then draw attention to the
tricky part (or parts) of the word, pointing out letters not pronounced as one might expect they
would be (e.g., the ‘ai’ in _said_ ). This is the part of the word that students just have to remember.


By drawing attention to the regular as well as the irregular parts of the word, you teach students
that Tricky Words are only partial exceptions to the normal rules of reading and writing. (They are
not so much irregular as they are a little less regular than most words.) There are some parts of the
word spelled just as you would expect and also pronounced just as you would expect. Then there are
some others that are not. There is a subtle but important difference between teaching Tricky Words
this way and teaching them as single entities that have to be memorized as wholes, as if every part
of the word were unpredictable.


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program
**235**


**236**



Note that some Tricky Words are actually part of spelling patterns. For example, the words _he_, _she_,
_we_, _be_, and _me_ are taught as Tricky Words in earlier grades because it is hard to write stories without
them. However, once the ‘e’ spelling alternative for /ee/ is taught, these Tricky Words can be seen
as part of a larger pattern that includes words like _replay_ and _prefix_ . Other Tricky Words, such as
_one_ and _of_, remain tricky even when most of the spelling alternatives have been taught. By Grade 3,
students have been taught the majority of the code knowledge needed to decode most words in the
English language. As such, there is less of an emphasis on Tricky Words in the Grade 3 program.


~~**SIGHT WORDS AND TRICKY WORDS**~~


One of the most common terms in the world of reading instruction is _sight word_ . Unfortunately, this
is also a rather ambiguous and potentially confusing term. Educators use the term _sight word_ in
two different senses. For some people, sight words are high-frequency words that students need to
encounter frequently and learn to decode rapidly and effortlessly. Other people use the term _sight_
_word_ in a more restrictive sense, to refer to words that cannot be sounded out using letter-sound
correspondences and may need to be taught as exceptions.


In this program, we define these terms as follows:


 - A Tricky Word is a word that does not play by the rules. It is a word containing at least one part that
cannot be read correctly via blending or cannot be spelled correctly using the code knowledge taught
so far.


 - A sight word is a high-frequency word that we want students to see many, many times and learn to
read quickly and eventually learn to recognize rapidly.


The main difference here is that a Tricky Word always contains some irregular element, whereas a
sight word might or might not.


There is considerable overlap between the two categories (which is probably why the two senses of
_sight word_ are regularly confused). Some words qualify as sight words because they are used a lot
and also as Tricky Words because they are not pronounced (or written) as you would expect. These
are words that are both irregular (and therefore hard to read and write, at least at first) and also very
common (and therefore important for student success). They are candidates for special instruction,
and many of them are given special instruction in this program.


Tricky Words do not qualify as sight words on most lists because they are not especially common.
Words of this sort are sprinkled throughout the language but do not receive much attention because
they are only used occasionally. Students can learn them as the need arises in upper grades.


Foundational Skills 7


~~**CUSTOMIZING AND ADAPTING THE PROGRAM**~~


This is a highly structured and sequenced program. We are unapologetic about that, as we believe
the structure and sequence will be very helpful to students as they work to learn the English spelling
code. However, this is not a scripted program in which teachers are required to read the manual and
give one of a handful of approved responses. We expect—indeed, we hope—teachers will tweak the
phrasing and come up with ways to customize, personalize, and adapt the instruction.


Our goal has been to put things in a logical order and provide all the guidance and support
necessary for a new teacher, or a teacher new to this kind of phonics instruction.


At the same time, we believe there is room for experienced and creative teachers to customize
and adapt the program. Indeed, some of the exercises included in this version of the program were
developed by teachers in our pilot programs!


Sometimes in the lessons, we give exact phrasing that we suggest you use; more often, however, we
give indirect phrasing and/or encourage you to explain something using your own words. You should
feel free to make changes to the phrasing. For example, you may prefer to speak of “a picture of a
sound” or a “spelling.” Later in the year, you may want to teach the term _digraph_, or you may prefer
to refer to the letters in a digraph as a “letter team” or as “buddy letters.” There are many ways to
customize the program and the language while preserving the basic instructional principles and
sequence of instruction.


For the presentation of words, you may write on a chalkboard, a whiteboard, chart paper, an
overhead projector, a document camera, or the projection system of your choice. A projection
system works especially well for activity pages since it allows the teacher to model the task exactly
as the students will be completing it. You may use a pocket chart, a magnetic board with magnetic
letters, an overhead projector with letters cut from a transparency, or a smart board. Many
modifications of this sort can be made without adversely impacting the quality of the instruction.


You should also always feel free to add additional activities and activity pages that are consistent
with our philosophy of instruction. You should always feel free to respond to the teachable moment,
even if it leads you slightly off the path laid out in the Teacher Guide.


There are only a handful of things you should not do:


You should not skip a lesson in which new code knowledge is taught. If you do, students will lack
important code knowledge, untaught spellings will begin to appear in their word lists and on their
activity pages, and the lessons will start to make less sense to them.


For the same reasons, you should not reorder the lessons. The program relies heavily on sequencing,
and instruction will be confused and less effective if the lessons are reordered.


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program
**237**


**238**



~~**SMALL-GROUP WORK**~~


Large parts of this program have been written for whole-group instruction, but the program can be
customized to allow for small-group instruction of various kinds. You will note that there are Support
and Challenge sidebars sprinkled throughout the lessons that will guide you in how to differentiate
instruction for your students, while still using the whole-class approach described in the lessons.


Since some students will learn the new information right away while others will need more practice,
you may wish to do small-group work to follow up the initial introduction of code knowledge. You will
note that many lessons do include suggestions for small groups; you should feel free to adapt these
and other lessons as best meets the needs of your students. We have seen this program taught very
effectively in small groups and in workstations students visit on rotation.


~~**ADJUSTING THE SPEED OF INSTRUCTION**~~


This sequence will work for most children. However, all children are different, and all classrooms are
different. Some classrooms may need more time to master concepts than others. The program has
been designed so the pace of instruction can be adjusted as needed.


The most important thing for you to know is that you can pause at any point in the program.
If students are not learning the material, simply stop where you are and do additional work to
accelerate or reteach as needed. All lessons contain some materials you can use if you pause.


In addition, at the end of each unit there is a “Pausing Point.” If the end-of-unit assessment or your
observations suggest some members of the class need additional time to master the concepts
taught in the unit, this is an especially good place to stop and provide additional practice and
review. The Teacher Guides include additional work at each Pausing Point. They will typically provide
enough for at least 1–2 days of additional work. The materials provided in the Pausing Point can be
used in various ways. Sometimes you may wish to have all students do the same activity or activity
page. At other times you may wish to work individually or in small groups with students who are
struggling with a particular concept.


To slow down instruction, you can pause either in the middle of a unit or at a Pausing Point. We do
not recommend that you attempt to speed up the sequence of instruction. The program lays out an
ambitious program of instruction.


The Grade 3 program of instruction should work well for a wide range of students. You should begin
with the assumption that the Grade 3 program is an appropriate option for all students in the class.


Inevitably, however, there will be differences in learning. Students learn at different rates. Some
students will pick up the material quickly; others will have more difficulty. There are many strategies


Foundational Skills 7


for dealing with this. In general, we encourage you to try to keep most of the class together if it
makes sense. It is much easier to teach one set of students at roughly the same level than it is to
teach two or three groups at very different levels.


If you find some students are lagging, you may still be able to keep the class together for the main
lessons but find extra time two to four times a week to work with those students who seem to need
extra practice.


If this is not sufficient, you may eventually need to regroup some students. As we note in Lessons
4–5 of this unit, it is especially important to administer the placement assessment to all students at
the start of the year. We strongly recommend that teachers then use an “across grade” approach to
grouping students. If there are two classrooms, these two teachers should look at all of the Grade 3
students in both classrooms and consider regrouping students for Skills instruction only, with one
teacher taking the class of students who need review and more practice, while the other teacher
works with those students ready to move on to Grade 3 Skills instruction. It will likely be worthwhile
to reconvene at multiple times during the year to plan across the grade level, using the end-of-unit
assessments. In this way, students in need of acceleration can be moved to the appropriate group,
while students who are making progress can advance.

**Appendix C:**
##### Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words

Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught will enable students to read onesyllable words with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences is no
guarantee that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllabic words. To this
end, most students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk, and read
parts of words—syllables—to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can then
be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated, and students are expected
to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, the program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the easiest
two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is already a
familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In addition, each
syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing, hunt·er, bust·ed_ ). The
dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain double-letter
spellings for consonants, in this program, the divider is typically placed after the double-letter
spelling rather than between the two consonants (e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers that are
familiar with other ways to chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is done, however,
because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single-spelling units since kindergarten
(‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.). The program strives to be consistent in representing these
spellings in the way that the students have been taught to process them (e.g., as whole entities
for a sound). (Ultimately, as students become more proficient at decoding and chunking syllables
through subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually chunk and decode
these words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding these two-syllable
words consisting of root words and suffixes relatively easy.


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable words.


Appendix C: Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words
**249**


**250**



To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


**• Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound (e.g.,**
/ **a** / **,** / **e** / **,** / **i** / **,** / **o** / **,** / **u** / **):** _let_, _pad_, _rod_, _tin_, _fun_, _pic·nic_, _un·til_


**• Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g.,** / **ae** / **,** / **ee** / **,** /
**ie** / **,** / **oe** / **,** / **ue** / **):** _cake_, _home_, _like_, _mule_, _Pete_, _mis·take_, _stam·pede_


**• Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint_, _speak_, _proud_, _play_, _dis·may_, _be·low_, _coun·sel_


**• R-Controlled Syllables:** _art_, _curb_, _girl_, _fort_, _clerk_, _tur·nip_, _ar·tist_, _fe·ver_


**• Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g.,** / **ae** / **,** / **ee** / **,** / **ie** / **,**
/ **oe** / **,** / **ue** / **):** _go_, _me_, _hi_, _a·pron_, _f·nal_, _com·pre·hend_


**• Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple_, _puz·zle_, _raf·fe_, _ca·ble_, _ri·fe_


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


**• Schwa Syllables:** _ben·e·fit_, _ap·pe·tite_, _a·bout_, _hos·pit·al_, _e·mo·tion_


Note: The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately because
of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


To decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these names. The names of the
syllable types are provided here only to establish a common vocabulary for teachers as they use
the materials. What is necessary, however, for students to become fluent readers of longer words in
increasingly complex text is that they be able to visually parse certain spelling patterns as syllable
chunks so they can quickly and easily decode each syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.


Foundational Skills 7


_ad·mit_ _nap·kin_ t _rum·pet_


For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed after
the double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is because the
double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units since kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’

- /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).


_traff·ic_ _muff·in_ _happ·en_


When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.


_mon·ster_ _con·tract_ _pil·grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read
the first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model
for students how to blend the two syllables aloud:







In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the magic
‘E’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for closed
syllables:


_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


In Grades 2 and 3, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to use


Appendix C: Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words
**251**


a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying each
possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:


_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_









**252**



However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There is
no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be flexible
and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to determine
whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. To recognize whether a
word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has heard before
(i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent an additional
challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a second language.


If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:


Foundational Skills 7


_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is straightforward.


When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings
in the words.


_ban · gle_ _twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_









Appendix C: Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words
**253**


**254**



In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings represent
the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a combination of
stressed and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed or weakly
stressed, its vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that linguists call
a schwa. This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’
and ‘tion’. Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite challenging for
many students.


Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the
schwa sound has a particular spelling:


_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is a schwa syllable, but it is identified separately
because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables
accordingly throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness_ _help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten–Grade
3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.
