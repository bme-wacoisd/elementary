**Grade 3 | Foundational Skills 3**
Introduction


~~**UNIT 3 OVERVIEW**~~


Unit 3 focuses on enabling students to read and spell multisyllabic words with vowel-consonant-e
(VCe) syllables, essential for understanding the structure and pronunciation of complex English
words. Understanding the pattern of VCe syllables helps students read multisyllabic words more
fluently. They learn that the final ‘e’ often changes the pronunciation of the preceding vowel, which
is crucial for accurate spelling. Additionally, methods are provided for teaching the nuances of
spelling words with suffixes, especially those requiring the alteration of the base word by dropping
the final ‘e.’ This alteration often changes both the meaning and pronunciation of the word. This
skill significantly expands a student’s vocabulary. It allows them to form and recognize a wider
array of words from a single base word. As students progress in their education, they will encounter
increasingly complex texts. Understanding word modification rules, like dropping the final ‘e’,
prepares them to tackle these texts more effectively.


~~**TRICKY SPELLINGS**~~


As new spellings are introduced, some complexity is added to the reading process. Some of the
spelling units that students have to process are ambiguous in the sense that they can stand for
more than one sound. These ambiguous spellings are called “tricky spellings.” In Unit 3, instruction
focuses on split digraphs, or VCe spellings. These terms mean the same thing and are used
interchangeably. Students build on this concept by examining how a consonant suffix, especially
when attached to a base word that ends in silent ‘e,’ changes the spelling of the base word. Students
build on this concept by examining how a suffix, especially when attached to a base word that ends
in a vowel, changes the spelling of the base word.


**Note:** The term “split digraph” is used throughout this unit. Using this term is the equivalent of
using VCe to denote the vowel–consonant–silent e pattern. VCe is referenced in multiple TEKS
throughout the unit; these terms are interchangeable.


~~**TRICKY WORDS AND HIGH-FREQUENCY WORDS**~~


Tricky Words are introduced in this unit on an as-needed basis in the context of the different
selections included in the Reader. Tricky Words should be taught in the lessons before the reading
selections are assigned. When introducing Tricky Words, be sure to draw attention to the parts that
are read (and spelled) just as students would expect based on what they have learned so far, and
point out the tricky parts of each word.


Introduction
**1**


The Tricky Words taught in this unit are:


     - Lesson 1 – _muscles_, _building_


     - Lesson 3 – _blood_, _soldier_, _bacteria_


     - Lesson 5 – _sugar_, _pressure_


     - Lesson 7 – _intestines_


     - Lesson 11 – _tissues, tissue_


In addition to addressing Tricky Words and tricky spellings, this program emphasizes the reading
and spelling of high-frequency words carefully selected from word lists compiled by researchers
Edward William Dolch and Edward Fry. The selection of these words was based on their prevalence
within the unit Reader, and instruction is integrated into lessons at points where students will
naturally encounter these words within the assigned sections of the Readers.


The curriculum includes a structured approach for teaching high-frequency words, starting with
the introduction of 8–12 keywords at the beginning of each unit, selected for their relevance and
frequency in the unit’s text. Words are introduced using phonetic sounding and Spelling Cards for
decoding. Throughout the unit, these words are reviewed in various contexts, including through
decode/encode games and fluency checkpoints to assess automaticity and fluency. This ensures
that students engage with the words multiple times, enhancing their reading skills and confidence.


The high-frequency words taught in this unit are:


Lesson 1 – _grow_


Lesson 2 – _become_, _better_


Lesson 3 – _open_


Lesson 5 – _food_


Lesson 7 – _carry_


Lesson 8 – _clean_, _feet_


Lesson 9 – _tissues, while_


Foundational Skills 3
**2**


~~**READER: HEALTHY HUMANS: HOW TO KEEP YOUR BODY STRONG**~~


The Unit 3 Reader emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It likens sleep
to recharging batteries, vital for growth, cell repair, and enhancing memory, and recommends
establishing a consistent sleep schedule and relaxing bedtime routines. The text highlights the
benefits of regular exercise for heart health, circulation, and boosting the immune system, along
with the importance of a balanced diet for energy and growth. Hydration is emphasized, explaining
water’s role in nutrient transportation and waste elimination. Personal hygiene, including cleanliness
and dental care, is portrayed as crucial for preventing illness. The text also addresses the mindbody connection, advocating physical activity to improve mood and focus, and the importance
of expressing emotions. Finally, it underscores the positive impact of friendships and social
interactions on mental and physical well-being, promoting a sense of belonging and support.
Overall, the story educates children on the importance of physical, mental, and social health in a
holistic approach to well-being.


**Note:** Each time students encounter a new section of text in the Reader, the lesson includes new
vocabulary words and/or phrases to accompany the section of text. There are lessons in which
students reread sections of the Reader, for the purpose of building fluency. These lessons do not
introduce new vocabulary or have a vocabulary chart.


~~**UNIT 3 ASSESSMENT**~~


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


Throughout this unit, formative assessments are clearly marked for monitoring individual student
performance and progress in key skills. Quick Checks for Understanding to evaluate classroom
performance are also designated in each lesson. Fluency practice takes place regularly throughout
the unit. Records for recording student performance in an Anecdotal Reading Record, Grade 3
Foundational Skills Record, Grade 3 Fluency Record, and Grade 3 End-of-Year Summary are included
in the Teacher Resources.


**Student Performance Assessment**


In Lessons 14 and 15, you will be prompted to administer a multipart end-of-unit assessment.
In the first part, you will work one-on-one with students to complete the Fluency Assessment.
Students will engage in a review activity while awaiting their turn for the assessment. The Reading
and Spelling portion of the assessment takes place during the first 20 minutes of Lesson 15. Once
students have completed the assessment, they will have 10 minutes for Self-Sustained Reading.
Use time in this lesson to finish working with students who still need to complete the Fluency
Assessment in the previous lesson.


Introduction
**3**


The target words in each of these assessments include the vowel sound/spellings taught in this
unit; distractors have been intentionally selected because they represent frequent sound/spelling
confusions. Student performance on these assessments is a good indicator of whether students
have mastered the new sound/spellings.



~~**CURSIVE WRITING**~~




~~**[TEKS 3.2.D ]**~~



**4**



At Grade 3, students are expected to write neatly in cursive, using correct letter formation and
leaving space between words. Throughout the program, teachers are prompted to remind students of
this expectation and provide corrective feedback. For students who need additional review, the Grade
2 curriculum contains fourteen lessons of instruction in cursive writing. The cursive program covers
the lower- and uppercase alphabets and with the accompanying Activity Book, it provides both a
solid introduction to students new to cursive and a timely refresher to more experienced students.


Although this volume contains all the cursive instruction, the lessons are not designed to be
completed in the time allotted for Unit 1. Teachers should proceed at a pace that is right for their
classes, allowing new students of cursive to become comfortable writing each letter or letter group
before introducing new ones. Students reviewing cursive can sharpen their penmanship skills. Once
students have learned all the letters, have them practice by completing select writing assignments
in cursive.


Note that the lessons and activity pages do not comprise an exhaustive handwriting program, and
teachers may wish to consult other sources for information on topics such as writing posture, pencil
grip, and differentiated instruction for left-handed students.


~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice Unit 3 skills can be found in the
Pausing Point section included after the last lesson. It is strongly recommended that you pause for
one day and provide targeted acceleration for individuals or groups of students in any areas in which
they require supplementation based on the Student Performance Assessment.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available in the program’s materials. This
component has been designed to complement the unit. It consists of poetry, folklore, and fables.
These additional text selections provide opportunities for students to practice reading with fluency
and prosody (expression), as indicated by the anecdotal records, as well as a way to track progress
from unit to unit. See the Unit 1 introduction or directions in the Fluency Supplement for further
guidance.


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.


Foundational Skills 3


~~**REPEATED ROUTINES**~~


This unit strategically utilizes activities, games, and protocols from previous units to allow students
to practice new skills using familiar routines. Review and prepare for the following activities
introduced in previous units:


  - Reading and Dictation


  - Partner Reading


  - Choral Reading


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~

  - Write the word _rat_ on the board. Ask students to read it in unison.


  - Ask: What is the vowel pattern in this word? _(CVC)_ When we have a CVC
word, is the vowel long or short? _(short)_


  - Ask students to turn and talk with a partner: How can we make the short
vowel sound a long vowel sound in this word? _(add an ‘e’ to the end of the_
_word to make the VCe pattern)_


  - Add an ‘e’ at the end to form _rate_ . Ask students to read it in unison.


  - Point to each sound in _rate_ and say them aloud: /r/ (point to the letter ‘r’),

/ae/ (simultaneously point to the letters ‘a’ and ‘e’ with two fingers), /t/
(point to the letter ‘t’).


  - Display the Spelling Card for /ae/ > ‘a_e’ ( _cake_ ).


  - Remind students the vowel sound in _rate_ is /ae/. Explain that even though
the ‘a’ and the ‘e’ in _rate_ are separated, they work together to stand for the
/ae/ sound. This kind of spelling is called a split digraph.


  - Point out the VCe syllable pattern by circling the consonants ‘r’ and ‘t’
drawing a horseshoe shape around the vowels ‘a’ and ‘e’ to visually show their
connection. Point to the consonant ‘t’ as the consonant within this pattern.

write a few original sentences
that include as many VCe
words as possible. Then ask
them to read their sentences
aloud to a partner.


**Advanced/Advanced High**
Give students a short
text from the Reader that
contains words with the
VCe or split digraph pattern.
In pairs, have students
take turns reading the text
aloud in partner pairs. Have
students locate and write
down the VCe words and then
compare and discuss them
using the sentence frame: “I
noticed that the VCe words in
the text __.” Students should
take turns listening to their
partner and building on their
ideas as they compare and
discuss the VCe words.

outline the code /ae/ > ‘a_e’. Have students read the sample word provided.


 - Add ‘nar’ at the beginning of _rate_ to form _narrate_ . Ask students to read it in
unison.


 - Explain that there are two vowel sounds in the word, so _narrate_ has two
syllables. Clap the syllables while repeating the word.


 - Explain that in multisyllabic words that have the VCe syllable pattern, the
syllables are divided so that the syllable with the VCe pattern begins with the
consonant before it.


 - Draw a slash (/) to separate the syllables of the word _narrate_ as _nar/rate_ .


 - Add a ‘d’ to the end of _narrate_ to form the word _narrated_ . Ask students to
read it in unison.


 - Clap the syllables while repeating the word. Point out that the ‘a_e’ sound
stays the same in the three-syllable word.


 - Write _take_, _mistake_, and _mistaken_ on the board and repeat the process,
identifying and marking the VCe pattern and drawing slashes to separate the
syllables in each word.


 - Explain that you will play a jumping game to test students’ understanding of
VCe words. Ask students to spread out so they are arm’s reach away from
their neighbors.


 - Write the word _name_ on the board. Next, ask students to crouch and jump
once as you read the word name. Explain that they only jumped once
because _take_ only has one syllable.


 - Add the letters _re_ before _name_ to form _rename_ ; read the word aloud and ask
students to crouch and jump with each syllable. Add the suffix – _ing_ to form
_renaming_ and ask the class to jump as you read each syllable.


 - Repeat the process with additional words: _restated_, _narrating_, and _frustrated_ .


~~**PRACTICE WITH HIGHLIGHT THE CODE (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Move students into small groups.


 - Have students open to Activity Page 1.1. Distribute highlighters.


 - Explain the directions for Highlight the Code. For each word, groups will
highlight the letters that make up the split digraph in each word, and draw a
slash to mark the syllables.

  - Direct students to then choose one word from the list and write a sentence.
Remind students to write their sentences in cursive, leaving spaces between
the words.


  - Circulate and monitor as students write in cursive on Activity Page 1.1.
Provide immediate and corrective feedback such as, “Check that your loops
and tails are formed smoothly and connect to the next letter.” Also, check to
ensure students are highlighting the split digraph accurately.


  - As students work, observe and make note of students who need additional
support to identify the split digraphs and/or syllabication of words. For those
students, you may wish to pull a small group and complete this activity
together.

Reader
~~**READ HEALTHY HUMANS: HOW TO KEEP YOUR BODY STRONG (10 MIN.)**~~


         - Explain that today, students will begin reading their new Unit 3 Reader,

_Healthy Humans: How to Keep Your Body Strong_ . They will start with the
Introduction on page 1.



Pages 1–5




 - Preview the following vocabulary words that students will encounter in

this section of the Reader. Have students work with a partner to decode
the words in isolation first and go over the correct pronunciation of each
word.


**cells, n.,** the smallest unit of life, making up all plants and animals
Example: Our bodies are made up of cells that are so tiny we cannot see
them individually without a microscope.


**gland, n.,** an organ that produces substances for the body to use
Example: Our salivary glands produce the saliva that helps digest our food.


**neurons, n.,** nerve cells that send information to the brain and body
Example: There are billions of neurons in your brain that connect with one
another.


**organizing, v.,** putting things in categories or a certain order to make them
easier to understand or find what you need

Example: She is organizing her books in alphabetical order, so titles starting
with “A” come first and “Z” comes last.


**pituitary, n.,** a small brain gland that makes important body hormones
Example: Your pituitary gland helps your body with many important
functions.


**proteins, n.,** parts of the body that help with growth, repair, and other
functions

Example: Sleep is important for our bodies because during that time they
make the proteins that you need to grow.


 - Conduct a brief discussion about the different words in the chart. For
example, show the words and ask students what prior knowledge they may
have about these words and where they might have seen them.


 - Model how to use the Glossary in the Reader to discover the pronunciation

and definition of words in bold. Review the definition together and ask
students to share their understanding of the word. Call on a few students to
share their thoughts.

  - Ask students: What are some ways to keep your body strong and healthy?

_(exercise, regular doctor visits, eating healthy foods)_


  - Write the word _healthy_ on the board. Focus on the ‘ea’ vowel team. Remind
students that they have learned that ‘ea’ most often makes the long /ee/
sound as in _clean_ . Sometimes it does not play by the rules and makes the
short /e/ sound as in _head_ . In _healthy,_ the ‘ea’ vowel team makes a short ‘e’
sound.


  - Direct a student to come up to decode the word _healthy_ . Have student isolate
the vowel sounds and blend the sounds together to read the word aloud.
Clarify the meaning of _healthy_ as needed. Invite students to turn to a partner
and use the word in a sentence. Provide sentence stems as needed, such as
“One way to be healthy is _______” or “I feel healthy when I _______.”


  - Invite students to share their sentences.


  - Write this passage from the Reader on the board: There’s a small part of your
brain called the pituitary gland. It creates something called growth hormone,
which plays a key role in your body’s growth.


  - Ask a student to come up and isolate the vowel sounds in the word _creates_
and then blend the sounds together to read the word.


  - Point out that this word follows the VCe pattern to make the /ae/ sound.


Lesson 1 Introduce Split Digraph a_e
**15**


                 - Guide student to divide the the word _creates_ into two syllables. Ask students

if they can locate the VCe pattern in the word _creates_ . Guide students to
notice that a-e makes the long a sound. Ask: What syllable patterns are
present in the word creates? _(The first syllable is open, and the second_
_syllable consists of the VCe pattern.)_


                  - Explain that _Healthy Humans: How to Keep Your Body Strong_ contains many

high-frequency words. These are common words, so they will come across
them often as they read, in both the Reader and in many different texts.
Explain that learning to recognize these words and how to spell them will
improve their overall reading and writing fluency.


                 - Display this lesson’s high-frequency word: _grow_ . Have students isolate the
vowel and consonant blend and then decode the word.


                  - Point out that in today’s section of the Reader, students will encounter _grow_

with two suffixes. Display _growth_ and _growing_ next to _grow_, and say each
word aloud. Point out that the root word _grow_ does not change its sound
when the suffix is added.


                        - Ask: Is _growth_ a noun or verb? What does it mean? _(It’s a noun. “Growth”_
_is showing the process of growing.)_ Ask for or provide a sentence to show
that _growth_ is a noun: The ruler at the doctor’s office shows your _growth_
from one visit to the next.


                        - Ask: Is _growing_ a noun or a verb? What does it mean? _(It’s a verb. Growing_
_expresses an action.)_ Ask for or provide a sentence to show that _growing_ is
a verb: The puppy is getting bigger and _growing_ every day.


                 - Display the Tricky Words, read them, and use them aloud in a sentence:
_building, muscles_ .


                 - Point out which parts of the words are not regular and will either be taught
later or simply must be remembered.


                        - Tricky Word: _building_ (Explain that the letters ‘ui’ are pronounced /i/ with
the /uil/ all working together to make the /il/ sound. In this case, the /u/
is silent.)


                        - Tricky Word: _muscles_ (Explain that the letters ‘sc’ blend to sound like the
soft ‘s’, and the ‘c’ remains silent.)


                 - Invite students to share what they already know about the meaning of the
words.


                 - Ask students to turn and talk to an elbow partner to answer the prompt:
Predict what the Reader might be about based on the title and the
vocabulary words.

- Provide sentence frames, such as “Based on the title and the vocabulary
word(s) _________, I predict that the text will be about __________.”


- Ask students to open to the Introduction on page 1 of their Reader.


- Read aloud the Introduction.


- Direct students to turn and talk: Find two words in this paragraph that follow
the VCe pattern with a long /ae/ vowel sound. _(shape and lace)_


- Direct students to turn and talk: Find one word in this paragraph that follows

the VCe pattern, but the silent ‘e’ has been dropped to add a suffix. _(amazing)_


- Focus students on Chapter 1, “Sleep Routine,” starting on page 2.


- Model fluent reading for a sentence or two, using appropriate rate,
expression, and pausing for punctuation.


- Invite students to think of a simple action they can pantomime with their
bodies to show a key idea from this paragraph. For example, they can pretend
to “power down” like a toy that has run out of batteries. Have students orally
share their key idea in a complete sentence with either a partner or in a small
group.


- Ask: How is this Reader different so far from _Campfire Tales_ or _A Talk with_
_Animals_ ? _(It is informational text._ Campfire Tales _and_ A Talk with Animals
_were literary texts with characters, settings, and events.)_


- Invite students to think of a simple action they can pantomime with their

bodies to show a key idea from this paragraph. For example, they can point
to their brain with one hand while flexing a muscle on their other arm. With a
partner, have students share their key idea in a complete sentence.


- Pair students with intentional reading partners. Instruct students to read the
assigned section of the Reader, ending on page 5 with “…make you smarter!”


- Have reading partners select one or two paragraphs. Instruct students to
come up with a simple action they can pantomime with their bodies to show
a key idea from that paragraph.


- As students are reading the second paragraph, direct them to locate the

words _pituitary gland_ and have them look up the term in the glossary to
confirm its meaning. Pause and ask students, “How did the glossary help
you understand the meaning of _pituitary gland_ ?” _(The glossary provided the_
_pronunciation and definition of the word.)_


- Have students write their key idea in a complete sentence in the margin of
the Reader.

 - Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension, and students’ ability
to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or multiple-meaning
words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant questions to clarify any
information from the Reader or strategic prompts. Example prompts include:


1. **Literal.** What details support the idea that the pituitary gland plays a key
role in our body’s growth? _(The text says that the pituitary gland helps us get_
_taller, makes our muscles stronger, and works even when we rest.)_


2. **Inferential.** Why do you think the author compares our body to a batterypowered toy? _(Our bodies get tired and need rest to recharge just like a_
_toy’s battery is recharged.)_


3. **Inferential.** What is the most likely reason the author refers to proteins as
building blocks? _(They help our cells grow by repairing them.)_


 - Ensure students find evidence from the text to support their responses by
restating the question.


   - The text says that the pituitary gland . . .


   - The author compares our body to a battery-power today because . . .


   - The author refers to proteins as building blocks because . . .


 - As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record. Record notes about
mispronunciations, self-correction, pacing, transposition of words, and
expression. The teacher may also provide immediate corrective feedback
around accuracy in decoding multisyllabic words with a split digraph.


 - Invite partners to model for the class the different actions they created to
show the key idea in the paragraph they selected.


~~**WRAP UP (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students open to Activity Page 1.2. Read aloud the directions. Point
out that the Word Bank contains words from the Reader that have a VCe
pattern that makes a long /ae/ vowel sound. Before writing, have students
collaborate with a partner about what the words from the Word Bank
mean. Point out the /ae/ vowel sound in each word. Read the prompt aloud
together.


 - Instruct students to answer the prompt about the Reader using a VCe word
from the Word Bank and the high-frequency word _enough_ .


 - Circulate and monitor to check for students’ ability to construct a response,
as well as for correct letter formation in cursive. Provide immediate and
corrective feedback such as, “Remember to keep your letters consistently

  - As students write, ask them to read their sentence(s) aloud to you and show
where they used a VCe and high-frequency word. If students need additional
support to identify the main message, ask guiding questions to have them
recall the key points of the text. For students who have successfully identified
the message of pages 1–4, ask them to help a partner locate evidence in the
text that supports their response.

variety of end punctuation. Promote reading fluency by providing immediate
feedback around rate and expression. Give performance opportunities by
inviting students to read aloud, adding dramatic flair when they encounter
exclamation points and question marks during the reading.


  - Write the high-frequency word _grow_ on the board. Circle the letters ‘gr.’
Remind them that they may have learned that ‘gr’ is a consonant blend; both
‘g’ and ‘r’ make their own sounds, but when next to each other they blend
together.


  - Underline the vowel team ‘ow’. Remind students that they may have learned
that these vowels together are sometimes pronounced as a diphthong, or
sliding vowel, that sounds like /oe/ as in _snow_ .


  - Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves: /g/ /r/ /oe/. For additional support,
display the Spelling Cards for each sound.

- Have students turn and talk with a partner. Encourage students to actively
listen to their partner. After a few minutes, elicit responses and record
students’ ideas on the board. Use these ideas to discuss the differences
between the two syllable patterns and clear up any misconceptions.


- Support students in responding to their classmates’ ideas using sentence
frames such as “I agree with ______ because ________.” or “To add to that, I
think __________.”


- Next, write the word _demonstrate_ on the board and model isolating the vowel
sounds. Point to each sound in _demonstrate_ as you say its sound:


- Remind students that even though the two vowels in the final syllable of
_demonstrate_ are separated, they work together to stand for one vowel
sound, the /ae/ sound. As learned in the previous lesson, this is called a split
digraph.


- Point out the VCe syllable pattern by drawing a horseshoe shape around the
vowels ‘a’ and ‘e’ to visually show their connection. Point to the consonant ‘t’
as the consonant within this pattern.


- Remind students that the best way to read a word with this pattern is to first
look for the vowels and then break the word into syllables around the vowel
spellings.


- Ask: How many syllables are in the word? _(three)_


- Draw a box around each syllable: _dem_ / _on_ / _strate_ .


- Remind students that although there are four vowels in the word
_demonstrate_, there are only three vowel spellings and three vowel sounds.
The ‘a’ and ‘e’ in _strate_ work together to form one vowel spelling and one
vowel sound. This means there are only three syllables in the word.


- Remind students that in multisyllabic words that have the VCe syllable
pattern, the syllables are divided so that the syllable with the VCe pattern
begins with the consonant, digraph, or consonant blend before it. Point to the
third syllable, _strate_, as an example of this rule.


- Ask: What vowel sound does the VCe syllable make in this word? _(/ae/)_


- Remind students that most VCe syllables will have a long vowel sound.


- Ask: Are the first two syllables open or closed? _(closed)_


- Remind students that closed syllables usually have a short vowel sound.

                 - Ask students to turn and talk to an elbow partner to answer the prompt:


                        - Based on the title of this heading, what do you think this section is going

to be about? _(having a healthy bedtime routine)_


                - You may provide a sentence frame such as:


                        - Based on the title, I predict this section is going to be about ________

because _______.


                 - Explain that students will examine two new high-frequency words, which

are common words that they will come across often as they read and write.
Display this lesson’s high-frequency words: _better_ and _become_ .


                - Focus on the word _better_ . Say the word _better_ slowly. Ask where the syllables

should be divided. Remind students that they may have learned that when a
consonant is doubled in a multisyllabic word, the syllables are divided there.
Draw a line to divide the two syllables, bet/ter. Say the syllables as you clap
them, then have students repeat in unison.


                 - Ask: What sound does the ‘e’ in the first syllable make, and why? What is this

type of syllable called? _(/e/ because it is between two consonants; closed_
_syllable)_


                  - Point out that in the second syllable, the ‘e’ is followed by an ‘r.’ Remind

students that ‘r’ controls the way the vowel before it sounds. In most words,
‘er’ makes the /er/ sound like in _her_ . Have students say /er/ with you as you
point to the letters ‘er.’


                 - Say the syllables as you clap them, then have students repeat in unison.

Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves: /b/ /e/ /t/ /er/. For additional
support, display the Spelling Cards for each sound.


                - Focus on the word _become_ . Have students think about where the syllables

should be divided as you say the word slowly. Ask: What sound does the ‘e’
in the first syllable make? What is this type of syllable called? ( _/ee/_ ; open
_syllable_ ) Ask students where the syllables should be divided, then draw a line
to divide the two syllables, be/come. Say the syllables as you clap them, then
have students repeat in unison.


                  - Look at the second syllable. Point out that the ‘o_e’ looks like a split digraph

but is not. Here, the ‘e’ is silent, but the ‘o’ is pronounced as a short /u/.

  - Say the syllables as you clap them, then have students repeat in unison.

Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves: /b/ /ee/ /k/ /u/ /m/. For additional
support, display the Spelling Cards for each sound.


  - Preview the following vocabulary words that students will encounter in this
section of the Reader. Have students work with a partner to decode the
words in isolation first and go over the correct pronunciation of each word.


**consistent, adj.,** having a regular style or pattern; not changing
Example: I have a consistent way of making my bed each day.


**cortisol, n.,** a hormone that gives our bodies the energy to fight stress, fever,
injury, or illness

Example: Being physically active will increase your body’s cortisol.


**melatonin, n.,** a hormone that helps control waking and sleeping
Example: Sleeping in a dark place will help your body produce more of the
melatonin it needs at night.


**routine**

**1. n.,** the usual order and way in which you do things
Example: Every morning, I have a routine where I brush my teeth and get
dressed for school.
**2. adj.,** ordinary or common, often repeating
Example: Cleaning up the leaves after a storm is a routine problem
because we have many large trees.


**Sayings and Phrases**


**Train your brain** is a saying that means when you do the same thing over
and over, your brain gets used to the routine and expects its regular tasks.

Example: Anytime you start something new, whether it’s a class, hobby,
sport, or schedule, it takes time to train your brain to get used to it.


  - Conduct a brief discussion about the different words and phrases in the

chart, including the meaning of the saying “train your brain.” For example,
show the words and ask students what prior knowledge they may have about
these words and where they might have seen them. The multiple meanings
of the word _routine_ will be explored in depth during the reading of the story.
Briefly explain them as you preview the vocabulary chart.


  - Model how to use the Glossary in the Reader to discover the pronunciation

and definition of words in bold. Review the definition together and ask
students to share their understanding of the word. Call on a few students to
share their thoughts.

                        - **Note:** The term “split digraph” is used throughout this unit. Using this

term is the equivalent of using VCe to denote the vowel–consonant–
silent e pattern. VCe is referenced in multiple TEKS throughout the unit;
these terms are interchangeable.


**Reading**

                 - Preview the section of the Reader that will be read during this lesson to
locate vocabulary, split-digraph, and VCe multisyllabic words referenced
during instruction. Consider using sticky notes to mark this section to
easily find vocabulary terms: _advise_, _arteries_, _clogged_ and _valves_ . Display
vocabulary on the board for students to decode.


                - Predetermine reading partners.

lesson’s two high-frequency words, the first syllables in better and become.
Repeat and emphasize _bet_ and _be;_ then say _open_, emphasizing the second
syllable.


  - Ask: Is the sound of the ‘e’ in _open_ the same as the sound of the ‘e’ in _bet_ or
the ‘e’ in _be_ ? (No, the ‘e’ in _open_ makes the schwa sound.)


  - Remind students that they may have learned that schwa is a common sound
for a vowel to make in an unstressed syllable. In _open_, the stress is on the first
syllable.


  - Display the three sentences from this section of the Reader that contain the
word _open_, and guide students in chorally reading each of these sentences:


    - The sound your heart makes, “lub-DUB, lub- DUB,” is the sound of its
valves opening and closing.


    - Being active is important because it keeps the roads open and clean.


    - So when you exercise, you’re helping keep the roads for your blood open

and traffic-free.

~~**INTRODUCE SPLIT DIGRAPH ‘O_E’ (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Review what students have learned in previous lessons. Explain students will

now learn VCe syllables with ‘o’ as the long vowel. Have students think-pairshare to answer questions:


  - Display the words _lane_, _line_, and _lone_ . Have students share what they notice
about these three words. _(All have VCe syllables;_ lane _has the long ‘a’ vowel_
_sound,_ line _has a long ‘i’ vowel sound, and_ lone _has a long ‘o’ vowel sound.)_


  - Write the word _tone_ on the board. Ask students to read it in unison.


  - Point to each spelling in _tone_ as you say its sound: /t/ (point to the letter ‘t’),
/o_e/ (simultaneously point to the letters ‘o’ and ‘e’), /n/ (point to the letter ‘n’).


  - Explain that the vowel sound in _tone_ is /oe/. Remind them that even though
the ‘o’ and the ‘e’ in _tone_ are separated, they work together to stand for the
/oe/ sound. As learned in the previous lessons where they reviewed the /ae/
and /ie/ vowel sounds, this kind of spelling is called a split digraph.


  - Display the Spelling Card for /o_e/ > ‘o_e’ ( _home_ ). Direct students to find the
/oe/ sound on their Individual Code Charts and outline the code /oe/ > ‘o_e’.

                 - Explain that there are a few things strong readers do to make sure they are
good to go for reading. A strong reader chooses a comfortable reading spot,
puts away distractions, and tells themselves that they are going to remain
engaged. An engaged reader asks themselves questions as they read to stay
focused.


                 - Model this process for students. Settle into a comfortable position, clear your
reading area, take a deep breath, and smile as you say, “I’m good to go!”


                 - Read aloud the first sentence or two on page 18. Model pausing every few
sentences to ask yourself a question about what you are reading.


                  - Pair students with intentional reading partners. Direct them to settle into a
comfortable position, clear their reading area, take a deep breath, and smile
as they say, “I’m good to go!”


                 - Instruct students to partner read the assigned section of the Reader starting
on page 18 and ending at “. . . stronger over time.” on page 22. Prompt them
to pause and ask themselves questions as they read.


                 - Circulate and monitor, using strategic prompts to check for comprehension,
and their ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or
multiple-meaning words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant
questions to clarify any information from the Reader or strategic prompts.
Example prompts include:


1. **Literal:** Explain how healthy nutrients serve as fuel for our bodies? _(Our_
_bodies break down food to give us energy to move.)_


Foundational Skills 3

2. **Inferential:** What words on page 18 help the reader understand what the
word glucose means? _(a kind of sugar, provides energy)_


3. **Literal:** What two things are essential for cellular respiration? _(glucose and_
_oxygen)_


4. **Evaluative:** What details on page 21 support the idea that the harder you
work, the stronger your muscles get? _(movement makes our muscles_
_contract and relax, stressing muscles to get stronger, when you exercise your_
_cells add more muscles)_


5. **[Evaluative:]** [ How is building strong bones similar to building strong muscles? ]

_(exercise and pressure build both muscles and bones, cells send messages to_
_build both muscle and bone)_


  - Ensure that students draw evidence from the text to support their responses
using the following sentence stems:


    - Healthy nutrients serve as fuel for our body by . . .


    - The words that helped me understand what glucose means are . . .


    - ____ and ____ are essential for cellular respiration.


    - On page 21, it says . . . This shows . . .


    - Building strong bones is similar to building strong muscles because . . .


  - As you listen to students read, make notes regarding students’ ability to
decode multisyllabic words containing the VCe syllable in the Anecdotal

~~**MORE HELP WITH VCE PATTERNS**~~


  - Conduct additional practice with students by providing practice with VCe
words from this and the previous lessons. Include patterns for /a_e/, /i_e/,
and /o_e/. Have students write one word with each of the vowel sounds on
a whiteboard. Then, prompt them to try swapping vowel sounds between
the words. For example, if the original words are lane (/a_e/), time (/i_e/),
and tone (/o_e/), have students try putting an ‘a” in _time_ to make it _tame_,
and in _tone_ to make it _tane_ . (Continue this pattern, turning _lane_ into _line_ and
_tone_ into _tine_ ; and _lane_ into _lone_ and _time_ into _tome_ .) Discuss with students
whether the new words are nonsense or real words. Repeat this process with
two-syllable words with the VCe pattern.


  - List on notecards several two-syllable or three-syllable words with the VCe
/o_e/ pattern. Cut them up into syllables and have students mix and match
them to practice forming the VCe pattern and making new words (real or
nonsense). Make sure students are matching the word parts to form the
appropriate pattern.


**Play Phonics Bingo**

  - Use the materials located in the Additional Support Materials sectionin the
back of the Teacher Guide to play Phonics Bingo.


  - Distribute the Bingo cards and counters.

**Primary Focus:** Students will read and spell multisyllabic words with VCe
syllables. ~~**TEKS 3.2.A.ii; TEKS 3.2.B.i; TEKS 3.2.D**~~


~~**REVIEW THE VCE PATTERN (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students: What syllable pattern we have been studying in this unit? _(VCe)_
Why is it important to understand different syllable types?


  - Write the word _tadpole_ on the board in cursive. Ask students to read it in
unison.


  - Clap the syllables while saying _tadpole_ to demonstrate that it is a two-syllable
word.


  - Ask: If this word has two syllables, how many vowel sounds does it have?

_(two)_


  - Ask students to identify the two syllables. As needed, remind students that
in multisyllabic words that have the VCe syllable pattern, the syllables are
divided so that the syllable with the VCe pattern begins with the consonant
before it.


  - Prompt students to Turn-and-Talk: How do we divide the syllables for
tadpole? _(tad/pole)_


  - Ask: What syllable has the VCe syllable pattern? _(the second syllable)_


  - Remind them that even though the ‘o’ and the ‘e’ in _tadpole_ are separated,
they work together to stand for the /oe/ sound. Point out the VCe syllable
pattern by drawing a horseshoe around the ‘o’ and ‘e’ and pointing to the
consonant ‘s’ as the consonant within this pattern.


  - Display the Spelling Card for /oe/ > ‘o_e’ ( _home_ ). Direct students to find the
/oe/ sound on their Individual Code Charts.


  - Write the word _composing_ on the board. Ask students to read it in unison. Ask
students to isolate the vowel sounds in the word.


**TEKS 3.2.A.ii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open
syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllable; VCe

Support


For students who need
additional support with
reading and spelling
multisyllabic words, first
practice the split digraph
work with one-syllable
base words such as
_woke_, _pose_, and _note_ to
build confidence. Then,
add affixes or make
into compound words
and practice again with
two-syllable words (e.g.,
_awoke_, _impose_, _notebook_ ).


Challenge


Have students list three
words identifying or
describing something
they see in the classroom
that follows the VCe rule
for /oe/. Write them on a
list and give each student
a copy. Students then can
locate the objects, and,
once found, recite and
spell the word to receive a
point.

 - Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension and for their ability to use
context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or multiple-meaning words
Example prompts include:


1. **Literal:** What details from page 13–15 support the idea that oxygen is healthy
for our lungs? _(Oxygen turns food into energy. It keeps your lungs strong and_
_healthy. It stretches them.)_


2. **Inferential:** Why does the author compare our lungs to balloons? _(They fill_

_up with air just like balloons.)_


3. **Evaluative:** What details from this section of the text could you use to
encourage someone to exercise and be active? _(The text says that exercise_
_brings oxygen into your lungs and oxygen is needed to turn food into energy._
_Exercise keeps our lungs strong and healthy by stretching them.)_


 - Ensure that students speak coherently and draw evidence from the text to
support their responses:


   - Oxygen is healthy for our lungs because . . . I know this because it
says . . . on pg . . .


   - The author compares our lungs to balloons because . . .


   - I would encourage someone to exercise by telling them . . .

  - Preview the following vocabulary words that students will encounter in this

section of the Reader. Have students work with a partner to decode the
words in isolation first and go over the correct pronunciation of each word.


**bacteria, n.,** tiny forms of life in air, water, food, and living things, that often
cause disease

Example: Raw chicken has bacteria in it that can make you very sick if you
eat it.


**hydrated, adj.,** when a living thing has enough water in it to stay healthy and
grow

Example: They brought lots of water on their hike so they could stay
hydrated during the steep climb.


**microbes, n.,** an extremely small living thing that can only be seen under a
microscope

Example: Different types of microbes are found everywhere; some types are
helpful, while others can be harmful.


**Sayings and Phrases**


Having a **happy tummy** is a phrase that refers to a healthy stomach and
digestive system

Example: When I eat fresh fruit, I have a happy tummy!


  - Conduct a brief discussion about the different words and phrase in the chart,
including the meaning of the saying “happy tummy.” For example, show the
words and ask students what prior knowledge they may have about these
words and where they might have seen them.


  - Model how to use the Glossary in the Reader to discover the pronunciation

and definition of words in bold. Review the definition together and ask
students to share their understanding of the word. Call on a few students to
share their thoughts.

- Explain that students will examine another high-frequency word.


- Display this lesson’s high-frequency word: _carry_ .


- Say the word _carry_ slowly. Ask where the syllables should be divided. Remind

students that as they reviewed with _better_, when a consonant is doubled in
a multisyllabic word, the syllables are divided there. Draw a line to divide the
two syllables, car/ry. Ask: What sound does the ‘a’ in the first syllable make?
_(/ae/)_


- Point out that even though the ‘a’ is followed by an ‘r’ in _carry_, the sound of
the ‘a’ is not controlled by the ‘r’; we do not pronounce this word _car_  - _ee_ .


- Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves: /c/ /ae/ /r/ /ee/. For additional
support, display the Spelling Cards for each sound.


- Display the Tricky Word, read the word, and use it aloud in a sentence:
_intestines_ .


- Point out which parts of the word are not regular and will either be taught
later or simply must be remembered:


- Tricky Word: _intestines_ (Explain that the second ‘i’ is pronounced /i/.)


- Invite students to share what they already know about the meaning of the
word.


- Display the following phrases which contain words from the text. Point

out spelling patterns and define words as needed. Have students use the
glossary if needed.


  - contributes to a better home


  - your digestive system


  - microbes or bacteria


  - substitute for drinking water


- Read aloud the first sentence under “Happy Tummy” on page 24.


- Model thinking aloud about the keywords in this sentence: I think the
keywords in this sentence are “digestive system” and “wild waterslide.”
“Digestive system” tells the reader what the sentence is about. “Wild
waterslide” is a comparison that helps readers to understand the digestive
system.


- Read aloud the first sentence again, modeling using expression and
emphasis on the keywords. Ensure students that there may be other words
that could be considered keywords. Emphasizing different words tells your
listener what big ideas you want to convey.

Lesson 8 Introduce Consonant Suffixes
**87**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


The next instructional arc in this unit moves students from focusing on
VCe syllable patterns to suffixes that follow the silent ‘e’. In Unit 3 lessons,
in which students are learning the rule about adding a suffix that begins
with a consonant to words ending in a VCe syllable, students will focus
on the suffixes _–ly_, _–ful_, and _–less._ These suffixes will be covered again in
later units. In Unit 3 lessons, in which students are learning the rule about
adding a suffix that begins with a vowel to words ending in a VCe syllable,
students will focus on the suffixes _–y_, _–ed_, and _–ing_, which they learned in
Unit 2. While there are many other suffixes—many of which are explored in
later units—limiting the suffixes that students work with now will help them
solidify their understanding of the rules.

Emergent Bilingual Students.


**Universal Access**

                 - Challenge students to create a list of words that contain the – _ful_ and – _ly_
suffixes. When doing so, students will notice and attend to the spelling rules
for adding suffixes. Asking students to write and act out sentences using
these words allows them to demonstrate their understanding of how – _ful_ and

             - _ly_ suffixes change the meanings from their base words.


                  - Make a list of VCe words with suffixes _(–ed, –ing, –er)_ from the lesson and
the Reader, _Healthy Humans: How to Keep Your Body Strong_ .


                 - Prepare word cards for VCe words with suffixes ( _–ed_, _–ing_, _–er_ ).

  - Tell students that today they will learn a rule about adding suffixes.


  - Remind students that prefixes come before the base word, and suffixes come

after the base word. Remind students that prefixes and suffixes also add a
syllable to the base word. Ask students to turn to a partner and discuss any
words they know with prefixes and suffixes. Have several students share out
and define the words.

Beginning
Provide word cards for VCe
words with suffixes _(–ed,_
_–ing, –er)_ . Have students
mix and sort the cards into
categories by suffix. Encourage
discussion about the patterns
they observe, and have them
explain why specific words
belong to particular categories.
Provide a sentence frame: “The
word ____ has suffix ____.”


Intermediate
Provide a set of VCe word
cards and suffix cards. In
pairs, have students combine
a VCe word card with a suffix
card to create a new word.
For example, combine “hope”

with “–ful” to form “hopeful.”

Have students write a list of
the words they create. Have
students analyze and discuss
the meanings of the newly
formed words. Ask how the
addition of different suffixes
transforms the meaning of
the base VCe words. Provide a
sentence frame: In our pairs,

we created the word ____ by

combining ____ with ____. We
think the new word means ____



we created the word ____ by

combining ____ with ____. We
think the new word means ____

because ____.



because ____.




- Explain to students that when prefixes and suffixes are applied to base
words, they can also change the meaning of the word.


- Tell students that today they will use base words with VCe syllables.


- Ask: What does a VCe syllable pattern look like in a word? _(A vowel, then a_
_consonant, then an ‘e’.)_


- Ask: What does the silent ‘e’ after the consonant do to the vowel it is split
from? _(It creates the long vowel sound.)_


- Remind students of the long vowel sounds they focused on in this unit
through their work with split digraphs: /ae/, /ie/, /oe/, and /ue/. As needed,
refer students to the Individual Code Chart for review.


- Display and give each student a copy of Adding Consonant Suffixes (TR 8.1).


- Read the first word _polite,_ and tell students it is a verb that means when one
shows respect.


- Point to the second row and read the word _polite_ and pause before pointing
to and reading the suffix – _ly_ . Explain the – _ly_ suffix changes a verb into an
adverb _(describes a verb)_ .


- Point to the last row and read the new word _politely_ . This adverb can now
describe a verb. So, when a person walks _politely_, they walk _(verb)_ in a way
that shows respect to others around them _(i.e. walking quietly and slowly to_
_not disturb others or run into them)_ .


- Chorally read the next word with students, _grace,_ and tell students it means
to be gentle or have care.


- Point to the second row chorally reading _grace_ and _–ful_ . Explain that – _ful_
means to be full of.


- Chorally read _graceful_ and prompt students to discuss what this new word
means.


- Follow this process with the last word _hope_, allowing students time to discuss
the meaning of the new word _hopeless_ .


- Ask: What does each suffix on TR 8.1 begin with? _(A consonant)_


- Ask: What kind of syllable does each base word end in? _(VCe)_


- Explain that when we add a suffix that begins with a consonant, like _–ly_, _–ful_,



Advanced/Advanced High

Provide sentence frames
with missing VCe words with
suffixes. In pairs, have students
complete the sentences by
filling in the appropriate word.

 - Direct students to point to the first sentence: That store _solely_ sells fresh
food. Identify the split digraph in _solely_ . (o_e)


 - Have students draw a horseshoe shape around the ‘o’ and ‘e’ to show how
they work together.


 - Underline the suffix _–ly_ .


 - Use sound-by-sound blending to decode the word _solely_ : /s/ /oe/ /l/ /ee/


 - Ask students to recall how the – _ly_ suffix changes a word. _(It makes the word_
_an adverb)_


 - Ask: In this sentence, what verb is solely describing? Suggest the sentence
starter: Solely is describing the verb... _(sells)_


 - Read the remaining sentences, drawing a horseshoe around the split digraph

in each, underlining the suffix, and discussing the new meaning of the words.


   - My dad likes to eat boneless chicken wings to refuel after working out.


   - She bravely walked across the rope bridge.


   - I am grateful to rest my body after playing.


 - Direct students to the blank lines. Explain that they will listen as you say
each word once, then repeat the word and write the word: _tirelessly_, _hopeful_,
_useful_, _absolutely_, _shameful_ . Repeat the word and write the word. If someone
needs a word repeated say: Class repeat.


 - Direct students to complete responses in cursive. Circulate and monitor
students’ ability to encode words with suffixes as they write in cursive on
Activity Page 8.1, monitoring student’s ability to encode words with suffixes.
Provide immediate and corrective feedback on letter formation such as,
“Check that your loops and tails are formed smoothly and connect to the
next letter.”


 - Invite students to partner up and discuss the meanings of the words they

wrote. Prompt students to use a dictionary to look up the definitions of each
word. Circulate and monitor students providing coaching and feedback as
needed. Review the definitions together and ask students to share their
understanding of the word.

Students will identify meaning of words with affixes. ~~**[ TEKS 3.3.C ]**~~


~~**REVIEW CONSONANT SUFFIXES (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that in the previous lesson, they learned about adding a

consonant suffix to a base word ending in a VCe syllable pattern. Explain that
today students will practice this rule.


  - Write the word _spine_ on the board in cursive, modeling proper letter

formation. Invite students to write the words in cursive in the air with their
index finger.


  - Create a three-column chart on the board. Label the columns – _ly_, – _ful_, and

  - _less_ . Point out that each suffix begins with a consonant.


  - Ask: Which of the three suffixes can be added to _spine_ to make a new word?
_(–less)_


  - Ask students to chorally spell the word as you add _spineless_ in the –less
column and then read the new word: _spineless_


  - Prompt students to turn and talk: How did adding the suffix – _less_ change

the meaning of the base word? _(The suffix –less means without, so spineless_
_means without a spine.)_


  - Focus students’ attention on the word _spineless_ . Prompt students to turn to

a partner and identify the split digraph in the word _spineless_ . Invite a student
to the board to draw a horseshoe to connect the split digraph ‘i’ to ‘e.’


  - Prompt students to turn to a partner and explain, in their own words, the rule

for adding a consonant suffix to a base word that ends in the VCe pattern.
Confirm that we keep the ‘e’ and add the suffix to the end of the word.


**TEKS 3.1.D** Work collaboratively with others by following agreed-upon rules, norms, and protocols; **TEKS 3.2.A.vi**
Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words using knowledge of suffixes, including how they can change

 - Direct students to Think-Pair-Share: Why is it important in words with a

split digraph to keep the ‘e’ before adding the suffix that begins with a
consonant? _(Dropping the ‘e’ would make the other vowel short. Keeping the_
_‘e’ keeps the vowel in the split digraph long.)_


 - Demonstrate the importance of keeping the silent ‘e’ at the end of _spine_ by
writing _spineless_ on the board for students to pronounce, then erase the
word.


 - Write the following words on the board: _rude_, _wise_, _late_, _taste_ .


 - Direct students to work with a partner and follow the same process using
their whiteboards with these words.


 - Tell students that some words will be able to be listed in more than one
column _(e.g., taste can become tasteful and tasteless)_ .


 - Tell students to take turns sharing the meaning of each word as they add it to
a column. As students work, if they are unsure about a word’s meaning, have
them look up the word in a dictionary and share it with their partner.


 - Remind students to write neatly in cursive.


 - Circulate and monitor, providing corrective feedback on letter formation.


~~**PRACTICE WITH ENCODE AND APPLY (5 MIN.)**~~

 - Recite the following words: graceful, solely, securely, timeless, strangely.


 - Direct students to draw a horseshoe to connect the split digraphs and

underline the suffix for words numbered 1–5 independently.


 - Focus students on the next section. Ask students to use the words that were
dictated to them and use each in an original sentence. Remind students to
write neatly in cursive.


 - As students work, if they come across a word that they do not know the
meaning of, have them use a dictionary to identify the meaning of the word.


 - Circulate and monitor as students write in cursive on Activity Page 9.1,
providing immediate and corrective feedback such as, “Ensure that your

**Beginning**
Provide word cards,
including base words and
suffixes. In small groups,
have students make words
by choosing a base word
card and a suffix card and
putting them together to
make a new word. Students
can share their work with
the sentence stem: I took

[base word] and the suffix

[add suffix] to make [new
word].


**Intermediate**
In small groups, provide
letter tiles and have groups
create word pyramids.
Start with one letter and
have students take turns
adding letters until a word
is formed. Each word
must include a suffix.
Have students discuss
the pattern for each
word pyramid. Provide a
sentence frame: All of these
words have ___ pattern.


**Advanced/Advanced High**

Provide a list of words
with suffixes that require
dropping the final ‘e’. In
pairs, have students take
turns spelling the words
aloud. Have students
discuss the language
patterns they notice. Ask
students: What is the
pattern? What suffixes
require you to drop

the final ‘e’?

~~**ELPS 1.H**~~


**112**




- Prompt students to turn and talk: What does the silent ‘e’ after the consonant
do to the vowel it is split from? ( _It creates the long vowel sound.)_


- Ask students to recall the long vowel sounds they focused on in this unit

through their work with split digraphs. They should name the sounds
/ae/, /ie/, /oe/, and /ue/. Invite students to provide examples of words that use
each of the sounds (i.e. _cave_, _hide_, _hope_, and _huge_ .) As needed, refer students to
the Individual Code Chart and Spelling Cards for review.


- Explain that when adding a vowel suffix, we drop the silent ‘e’ and add the vowel
suffix to the end.


- Explain that when adding a vowel suffix, we drop the silent ‘e’ and add the vowel
suffix to the end.


- List the following words on the board: _accelerate_, _synthesize_, _sunshine_, _diffuse_ .


- Gather the prepared sticky notes with suffixes – _y_, – _ed_, – _ing_, and – _ion_ on the
board.


- Ask: What effect does a suffix have when added to a base word? _(Suffixes can_

_change the part of speech and the meaning of a word.)_


- Use _accelerate_ in a sentence: When I pedal faster, my bike will accelerate down
the hill.


- Prompt students to turn and talk: What part of speech is _accelerate_ ? _(verb)_


- Demonstrate adding – _ion_ to the end of _accelerate_ to form _acceleration_ .


- Use _acceleration_ in a sentence: The acceleration of the roller coaster as it went
down the hill was exciting.


- Prompt students to turn and talk: What part of speech is _acceleration_ ? _(noun)_


- Clarify that the vowel suffix – _ion_ indicates an action, process, or state of being,
like _education_ or _donation_ .


- Display the prepared sticky notes with suffixes – _y_, – _ed_, – _ing_, and – _ion_ .


- Display the following answer options:


  - makes an adjective that describes a characteristic


  - indicates that an action happened in the past


  - indicates an ongoing action or state of being


Foundational Skills 3


  - Prompt students to match each option with one of the vowel suffixes to
indicate how it changes the meaning of a base word.


  - Confirm the following responses:


    - _y_ makes an adjective that describes a characteristic like _shiny_ or _wavy_ .


    -    - _ed_ indicates that an action happened in the past like _biked_ or _baked_ .


    -    - _ing_ indicates an ongoing action or state of being like _making_ or _writing_ .


  - Instruct students to write the first base word on their whiteboards.


  - For each base word, ask which suffixes could be added to form a real word.


  - Add the corresponding sticky note to the end of the base word, covering up

the silent ‘e’. Instruct students to erase the silent ‘e’ and write the suffix at
the end of the base word on their whiteboard.


  - Continue this process until students have practiced forming the following
words: _accelerating, accelerated, synthesizing, synthesized, sunshiny,_
_diffusion, diffusing, diffused._


~~**PLAY MIX AND MINGLE (5 MIN.)**~~

Activity Page 10.1

  - Have students open to Activity Page 10.1.


  - Explain that students will work together and play a game called Mix and

Mingle to create as many words as they can that have suffixes where the
base word changes because the silent ‘e’ drops.


  - Give each student Mix and Mingle Game Cards (TR 10.1).


  - Explain the instructions for Mix and Mingle:


    - Students will have several minutes to mix and mingle with each other to
create words with vowel suffixes using their cards.


    - Provide students with sentence stems to support their work together if

needed:


         - I have the base word _______. Which suffix can we add to it?


         - When I drop the ‘e’ and add _______, the word is _________.


         - With this suffix, the meaning changes to _______.


    - Once two students have combined their cards to create a real word, they
each individually write the word down on Activity Page 10.1.

based on information
from the Reader. Then,

have them write an
original sentence for each
vocabulary term. Have
the groups discuss their
definitions. They can listen

 - Focus students on the first section of “Dental Hygiene” from page 44 to page

47.


 - Move students to designated places in the room where they can read

independently and comfortably. Release them to read up through page 47.


 - Circulate and monitor, asking students to read aloud to you when prompted.

Offer corrective feedback on pronunciation and fluency as appropriate.


 - Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension and for their ability to use

context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or multiple-meaning words.
Example prompts include:


1. **Literal.** What words on page 44 help you understand what plaque means?

_(sticky, makes acid, creates tiny holes)_


2. **Literal.** How are plaque and tartar related? _(If we do not get plaque off of our_

_teeth, it turns to hard tartar.)_


3. **Inferential.** What key idea is supported by the details in the first

paragraph on page 47? _(We can use a toothbrush and floss to keep our_
_teeth clean.)_


4. **Evaluative.** Predict the outcome of someone not brushing their teeth

regularly. _(They would develop plaque which turns into tartar which eats_
_away at your teeth and affects your overall health. They would likely have_
_health issues inside and outside their mouth.)_


 - Ensure that students draw evidence from the text by restating the question in

their responses using the following sentence stems:


   - The words that helped me understand what plaque means are . . .


   - Plaque and tartar are related by . . .


   - The key idea of the first paragraph is . . .


   - I predict that if someone doesn’t brush their teeth, their teeth will . . .


 - As you circulate and listen to students read, make notes regarding their

individual reading ability on the Anecdotal Reading Record. Record notes
about mispronunciations, self-correction, pacing, transposition of words, and
expression.

Foundational Skills


**Foundational Skills**


**Beginning**
Provide students with a set
of cards of VCe words with
suffixes. Have students sort
the words into two groups:
words with the final ‘e’
dropped and words with no
changes. Provide a sentence
stem for students to explain
their sorting: The word
___ demonstrates the VCe
pattern. The word ___ does
not demonstrate the VCe
pattern.


**Intermediate**
Have students complete a
wordsearch puzzle of VCe
words with suffixes. Then
have them write the base
words next to list of puzzle
words. Ask students to
discuss in pairs how they
knew what the base

word was.


**Advanced/Advanced High**

Have students write
sentences with words
that follow the pattern of
dropping the final ‘e’. Have
students exchange with a
partner, read the sentences,

and highlight the words.
Then have students respond
to the question: Can you
explain why the final ‘e’ was
dropped in each highlighted
word? Discuss how it
impacts the pronunciation
and meaning of the word?

~~**ELPS 4.C**~~


**122**




- Ask: What happens when a suffix is added to a base word? _(The new word_

_has more syllables and has a different meaning.)_


- Remind students that for base words that have a split digraph (following the
VCe syllable pattern), dropping the silent ‘e’ before adding the vowel suffix
allows for the long vowel sound in the word to stay long.


- Divide the class into two teams. Have one team at a time come to the front of
the room in front of the baseball diamond and line up.


- To play, teams take turns “at bat”:


  - Pick a card from the pile Extra Innings Baseball Word Cards and ask the
first person on the team to read it and use it in a sentence.


  - If the word is read correctly and used correctly in a sentence, draw a line

from home plate to first base, signifying a “hit.” This player should go to
the back of his team’s line, while the next player comes forward to read
the next card. If the second player reads the word correctly, draw a line
from first to second base.


  - Play continues in this way so that each time a player reads a word
correctly a line is drawn to the next base. If the fourth player reads the
word correctly, draw a line from third base to home plate and mark one
run for this team.


  - Play continues by the members of this team until a run is scored or
when a word is misread or used incorrectly in a sentence. When a word
is misread or the sentence does not include the correct meaning of the
word, the next team takes its turn at bat.


  - As in the actual game of baseball, any “players left on base” when a word
is misread do not count or add to the score.


- After each player has had a turn “at bat,” play extra innings:


  - Have students open to Activity Page 11.2.


  - Call one player from Team A to pick a card from the pile and read it aloud.


  - Players on both teams will listen to the word, then write the word, and
underline the suffix. Direct students to complete responses in cursive.


  - Repeat with a player from Team B.


  - Repeat extra innings, alternating players from both teams, until all the
cards have been picked.


Foundational Skills 3


 - Circulate and monitor as students write in cursive on Activity Page 11.2,
providing immediate and corrective feedback such as, “Check that your
loops and tails are formed smoothly and connect to the next letter.”


 - Have teams spend time working together to define words from the game and
write the meaning on Activity Page 11.2.


 - Use the prompt to support students’ discussion: The suffix _____, helps me
to know that the word ______ means...


 - Encourage the use of reference sources, such as dictionaries, to confirm their

thinking.

 - Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension and for their ability to use
context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or multiple-meaning words.
When discussing the Reader or strategic prompts, remind students to speak
at an appropriate rate and volume while maintaining eye contact. Example
prompts include:


1. **Literal.** Using the information on page 48, describe the difference between
brushing your teeth in the morning versus brushing them at night. _(Brushing_
_in the morning cleans bacteria that grew overnight and brushing before bed_
_removes food you ate during the day.)_


2. **Inferential.** What will most likely happen if you only brush some of your
teeth? _(Bacteria and plaque can build up on the back teeth.)_


3. **Evaluative.** What detail from the text supports the idea that brushing and
flossing help keep our teeth healthy? _(Brushing helps remove bacteria, which_
_can cause plaque; flossing helps get the small pieces that can get stuck_
_between the teeth; the whole body is healthier when we brush our teeth.)_


 - Ensure that students speak coherently and draw evidence from the text by

restating the question in their responses using the following sentence stems:


   - The difference between brushing your teeth in the morning than at night

is . . .


   - If you only brush some of your teeth, they will . . .


   - . . . supports the idea that brushing and flossing keep our teeth healthy.


 - As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their ability to decode
multisyllabic words in context in the Anecdotal Reading Record. Provide
corrective feedback as students read such as “If you’re having difficulty
dividing words into syllables, say the word aloud and clap the syllables.”

Readings


**Reading**


**Beginning**
Preselect a portion of
text from the Reader for
students to read aloud.
As students read, listen to
how well they say target
words. Offer support as
needed.


**Intermediate**
Pair students and have
them write sentences from
the Reader on sentence
strips or index cards. Ask
them to mix them up and
work collaboratively with
a partner to discuss and
arrange the sentences,
taking turns reading and
listening to confirm the
correct order together.


**Advanced/Advanced High**

Have students select a
short passage from the
Reader and set a reading
fluency goal (e.g., words
per minute). Ask them to
read the selected passage
aloud, aiming to achieve
the set fluency goal using
self-monitoring strategies
to adjust reading speed,
if necessary, to meet the
fluency goal.

- Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension and for their ability to
use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or multiple-meaning
words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant questions to clarify any
information from the Reader or strategic prompts. Example prompts include:


1. Literal. What effect does adrenaline have on your body? _(makes your_
_heart pump faster and harder and increases your blood pressure)._


2. Inferential. What is the most likely reason the author compares
a body under stress to a video game? _(we are on high alert if we are_
_focused on a game or if we face a problem we need to solve)_


3. Literal. How is the effect of endorphins different than that of
adrenaline? _(endorphins are released when we exercise making us_
_relaxed and in a good mood, while adrenaline makes your heart pump_
_harder and faster making you feel stressed)_


4. Inferential. How does the suffix – _ful_ help you understand what
stressful means? _(stress is a response to address a challenge or_
_problem, stressful is an adjective that means something is causing the_
_response of stress)_


- Ensure students speak coherently and draw evidence from the text to
support their responses given the following sentence stems:


  - Adrenaline affects the body by _____.


  - The most likely reason the author compares our bodies’ response to a
problem to being surprised while playing a video game is _____.


  - Endorphins are different from adrenaline in that they _____.


  - The suffix _–ful_ helps me understand what _stressful_ means because . . .


- After reading the story, prompt students to reflect with a partner on their
fluency and accuracy.


- Offer students the following discussion sentence stems:


  - I was able to read fluently by ________ (making corrections, pausing at
punctuation, paying attention to phrasing).


  - I was able to decode unfamiliar words by ________.

~~**WRAP UP (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Direct students to Activity Page 12.2.


 - Tell students they will first isolate the vowel sound and draw a horseshoe

around the VCe to mark the split digraph in each word in the Word Bank.
Then they will use at least one word from the Word Bank to answer the
prompt about _Healthy Humans: How to Keep Your Body Strong_ .


 - Remind students to write neatly in cursive, leaving spaces between words.


 - Release students to complete Activity Page 12.2


 - Invite students to share their responses with a partner.

Additional Support


~~**MORE HELP WITH VCE PATTERN**~~


**Play Knock Out**

  - Use the materials located in the Additional Support Materials section in the
back of the Teacher Guide to play Knock Out with VCe words.


  - Explain that students will play a game called Knock Out to practice more

words that follow the VCe pattern and have suffixes.


  - Move students into pairs. Provide each pair with a Knock Out Game Board, a
set of Knock Out Word Cards, and two dice.


  - Review the game instructions:


    - Set a timer for 5 minutes.


    - One player rolls the dice.


    - That player picks up a card from the word card pile, reads it aloud,
identifies the letters that make the VCe pattern in the word, and writes
the word in the box on the game board that matches the number rolled,
underlining the VCe pattern.


    - The next player rolls the dice and repeats the process.


    - If a player rolls a number of a box that is already occupied with a word
written by the other player, they get to knock their opponent out by
erasing their word and replacing it with a new word from the next card in
their pile.


    - If a player rolls a number of a box that is already occupied with one of
their own words, they do not need to replace it.


    - Play continues until time is up. The player with the most boxes filled at
the end of time, wins!


    - If students use up all the word cards before time is up, they should
reshuffle the deck and begin again.


Foundational Skills 3


~~**MORE HELP WITH KNOCK OUT**~~


  - For students who need additional support, underline the suffixes and
highlight the long vowel on the Knock Out cards. It may also benefit these
students to preview the words before playing the game.


  - For students who require additional challenge, add more complex words

for the Knock Out game and the partner dictation activity: _absolutely_,
_usefulness_, _instituted_, _contributing_, _compensating_, _illustrated_, _gratefulness_,
_inhaling_, _restatement_, _completely_, _deleted_, _completeness_, _insider_, _excitement_,

**Reading**

 - Preview the section of the Reader that will be read during this lesson to
identify any soft ‘c’ and ‘g’ words students will encounter in this section.
Consider using sticky notes to mark this section to easily find vocabulary
terms: _fascinating_ and _motivate_ . Display vocabulary on the board for
students to decode.


**Universal Access**

 - Scaffold by introducing double syllable/shorter words, moving to multi-syllable
words with additional practice to assist students who need additional support
to determine when to drop or keep the ‘e’ in words with a soft ‘c’ and ‘g.’


 - For an additional challenge, teach students one more exception to the

vowel suffix spelling rule: keep the ‘e’ at the end of the word if it ends in ‘ee’
or ‘ye,’ such as _agree_   - _agreeing_ ; _decree_   - _decreeing_ ; _eye_   - _eyeing_ ; _foresee_   _foreseeing_ ; and _see_  - _seeing_ .


 - Prepare a list of base word cards and suffix cards for Emergent Bilingual
Students.


 - Prepare sentence stems to provide to students:


   - The word __ is spelled __ without the suffix.


   - Some key events in the story are _______.


 - Prepare visual aids, drawings, or a word bank to support Emergent Bilingual

  - Give a thumbs up if they add a syllable to the base word. _(thumbs-up)_


  - Distribute the Suffix Match Puzzle Pieces, ensuring each piece distributed
has a match.


  - Ask students to collaborate and move about the room and find the person
who has a suffix that can be added to their base word to form a real word.


  - Once all pairs have been created, ask each pair to read their words aloud.


  - Encourage the class to discuss each word as it is read aloud, offering
feedback on pronunciation. As time allows, invite students to share how the
word might be used in a sentence.


  - If students need help to find a partner, bring the whole group together
and ask a student with a base word to step to the front. Ask the rest of the
students to stand if they think they have a suffix that matches the base word.
Alternatively, ask three students with different suffixes to step to the front;
students with base words can then line up behind the suffix that matches
their word.


  - As time allows, redistribute the puzzle pieces and repeat the activity. For this
round, time students to see how long it takes them, then redistribute the
puzzle pieces and challenge them to beat their times.

Lesson 13 Review: Suffixes for Soft ‘c’ and ‘g’ Words
**143**


**144**



~~**REVIEW SUFFIXES (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Display the Spelling Card /s/ > ‘c’ ( _cent_ ).


 - Remind students that when a word has a ‘c’ followed by an ‘e’, the ‘c’ is usually
pronounced as /s/ (a soft sound), as in _face_ .


 - Display the Spelling Card /j/ > ‘g’ ( _gem_ ).


 - Remind students that when a ‘g’ is followed by an ‘e’, it often has a soft sound
/j/, as in page.


 - Remind students that usually when adding a vowel suffix like – _able_, – _ing_, and

 - _ous_ to a word ending in a silent ‘e’, the ‘e’ gets dropped. However, when the
base word ends in the letters ‘ce’ or ‘ge’ and the suffix begins with the letters
‘a’ or ‘o,’ the final ‘e’ should stay.


 - Write the word _manage_ on the board.


 - Ask students to read the first word aloud: _manage_ .


 - Direct students to identify the soft ‘g.’


 - Call a student to the board to add the suffix - _able_ .


 - Point out that the base word ends in ‘ge’ and the vowel suffix starts with ‘a,’ so
the ‘e’ remains.


 - Explain the suffix – _able_ means can be done. When added to _manage_, the new
word _manageable_ means can be _managed_ .


 - Repeat this process with the following words: _advantage_ - _advantageous_ ;
_change_  - _changeable_ ; _courage_  - _courageous_ ; _service_  - _serviceable_ ; _notice_  _noticeable_ .
**Note:**  - _ous_ means full of or having a lot of and – _ing_ shows that something is
happening right now.

time. ~~**[ TEKS 3.5 ]**~~


~~**PLAY KNOCK OUT (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students in the last lesson, we studied words with suffixes like _–able_,
_–ing_, and _–ous_ . Turn to a partner, and discuss what happens to the e when
these suffixes are added to a word ending in a silent ‘e’.


  - Explain that students will be called individually to take their Fluency
Assessment. While they are waiting their turn, they will play a game to review
the unit skills. Students should use whisper voices because their peers will be
concurrently testing as they play the review game.


  - Use the materials located in the Additional Support Materials section to play
Knock Out with VCe words.


  - Move students into pairs. Provide each pair with a Knock Out Game Board, a
set of Knock Out Word Cards, a whiteboard eraser, and two dice. Provide each
student with a whiteboard marker; each student must have a different color
marker from their partner.


  - Review the game instructions:


    - Set a timer for 5 minutes.


    - One player rolls the dice.


    - That player picks up a card from the word card pile, reads it aloud, and

writes the word in cursive in the box on the game board that matches the
number rolled.

    - The next player rolls the dice and repeats the process.


    - If a player rolls a number of a box that is already occupied with a word
written by the other player, they get to knock their opponent out by
erasing the current word and writing their new word in cursive.


    - If a player rolls a number of a box that is already occupied with one of
their own words, they do not need to replace it.


    - Play continues until time is up. The player with the most boxes filled at

the end of time wins!


    - If students use up all the word cards before time is up, they should
reshuffle the deck and begin again.


  - Consider allowing students to swap partners after each round of the game.


~~**SELF-SUSTAINED READING (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Students will be reading independently and quietly while peers continue to
take the Fluency Assessment.


  - Transition students to quiet reading time.


  - Use a previously established protocol for selecting recreational reading
materials.


  - Allow students to find comfortable places around the classroom to read.


  - Remind students of the expectations for quiet independent reading and the
importance of building reading stamina.


  - Provide suggestions for how students can maintain focus while reading, such
as breaking the text into chunks and taking short breaks between chunks, or
using a fidget toy.


  - Distribute the Self-Sustained Reading Tracker (TR 14.4) to students to keep
track of the books they are reading during self-sustained reading time.

**TEKS 3.1.C** Speak coherently about the topic under discussion, employing eye contact, speaking rate, volume, enunciation,
and the conventions of language to communicate ideas effectively; **TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and
prosody) when reading grade-level text.


Foundational Skills 3


~~**FLUENCY ASSESSMENT**~~


You will work individually with each student and take a running record of the
student’s oral reading of a text. For this assessment, you will take a simple,
easily calculated measure of the student’s fluency by seeing how long it
takes the student to read the text. Allow each student three minutes to
read the story. Students with proficient fluency should be able to complete
the text in this amount of time. Instruct students to speak coherently and
complete the comprehension questions after reading the text.


 - Have one student at a time come to a quiet assessment area to read “The

Town Parade” with you.


 - Ask the student for Activity Page 14.1 (Fluency Assessment) and Activity

Page 14.2 (Fluency Assessment Questions).


 - Tell the student you will ask them to read the story aloud.


 - Explain that you are going to use a watch to see how long it takes them to

read the story. Tell the student that this is not a race; they should read at
their regular pace and not rush.


 - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the title. If you are

using a watch, write the exact Start Time, in minutes and seconds, on your
record page.


 - If you are using a stopwatch, you do not need to write down the start time

since the stopwatch will calculate Elapsed Time.


 - As the student reads the story, make a running record on a copy of the text

using the following guidelines:



Activity Pages
14.1 and 14.2


|Individual Code Chart|No mark is required.|
|---|---|
|**Omissions**|Draw a long dash above the word omitted.|
|**Insertions**|Write a caret (^) at the point where the insertion was<br>made.<br>If you have time, write down the word that was<br>inserted.|
|**Words Read Incorrectly**|Write an ‘X’ above the word.|
|**Substitutions**|Write the substitution above the word.|
|**Self-Corrected Errors**|Replace original error mark with an ‘SC.’|
|**Teacher-Supplied Words**|Write a ‘T’ above the word. (counts as an error)|



Lesson 14 Fluency Assessment
**155**


**156**




- When the student finishes reading the story, write the exact Finish Time in
minutes and seconds on your record sheet.


- Alternatively, if you are using a stopwatch, simply write down the Elapsed

Time in minutes and seconds.


- If the student reads very slowly, you may need to stop the reading before the
student gets to the end of the story. (Five minutes should be enough time to
get a measurement.) If the student does not read to the end, draw a vertical
line on the record sheet to indicate how far the student read. Also, write down
either the Finish Time or the Elapsed Time.


- Direct the student to read and select the correct answer for each question on
Activity Page 14.2. Encourage them to reference the text as they respond.


- Repeat this process for each student.


- As needed, use the Grade 3 Fluency Record to track students’ ability to read
with appropriate rate, prosody, and accuracy.


Activity 14.2: Fluency Assessment


- If the reading was fairly accurate (<10 uncorrected errors), you can get a

rough (and easy) estimate of a student’s W.C.P.M. score simply by noting the
time and looking at the chart on the Unit 3 W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


- Calculate each student’s exact W.C.P.M. score using the following steps:


  - First, complete the Words section of the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


  - Count Words Read. This is the total number of words that the student

read or attempted to read, up to the point where they stopped. It
includes words that the student read correctly as well as words that the
student read incorrectly or skipped over. If the student attempted to read
the whole text, use 336 words as your total. If the student did not finish
the text, you must count the number of words they actually attempted to
read. Write the count for Words Read in the matching box on the W.C.P.M.
Calculation Sheet.


  - Count the Uncorrected Mistakes noted in your running record. This

includes words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and words
that you had to supply. Write the total in the box labeled Uncorrected
Mistakes. A mistake corrected by the student is not counted as one; the
student is penalized for the time they lost making the correction, but not
for the initial mistake.


  - Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get Words Correct.


Foundational Skills 3


    - Next, complete the Time section of the activity page.


    - Calculate Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a

stopwatch, this should already be done for you. Skip to the next step.)
If you used a watch and recorded start and stop times, you will need to
subtract the Start Time from the Finish Time to calculate the Elapsed
Time. Subtract seconds from seconds then minutes from minutes.
Calculate Time in Seconds. Multiply the number of minutes by 60 to
convert minutes to seconds, and then add the number of seconds.


    - Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then multiply by 60 to get
Words Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.).


  - As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider:


    - It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.

scores. However, a major goal for Grade 3 students is to read with
sufficient fluency to ensure comprehension and independent reading of
school assignments in subsequent grades. Exact fluency targets vary
from state to state; the national mean calculated by Hasbrouck and
Tindal in 2017 for Fall of Grade 3 is 83 W.C.P.M.


    - A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared with the score of other

students in the classroom (or grade level) and also with the national
fluency norms for Fall of Grade 3 obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal.
Students whose scores are below the 25th percentile (59 W.C.P.M) are
experiencing serious problems in reading fluently.


  - Compare the student’s W.C.P.M. score to national norms for Fall of Grade 3

(Hasbrouck and Tindal, 2017):

|Reading Time for this Text|W.C.P.M.|National Percentiles for Fall,<br>Grade 3|
|---|---|---|
|2:35<br>3:05<br>4:05<br>5:55<br>8:00|134<br>104<br>83<br>59<br>40|90th<br>75th<br>50th<br>25th<br>10th|



  - After you have entered each student’s scores on the W.C.P.M Calculation
Sheet, record them on the Grade 3 End-of-Year Summary for each student.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today you will complete the multi-part assessment. The Reading & Spelling
portion of the Assessment takes place during the first 20 minutes of this
lesson. Use the Reading Assessment Scoring Analysis (TR 15.1) and Spelling
Assessment Scoring Analysis (TR 15.2) to help determine and understand which
phonemes and words students missed. Once students have completed the
assessment, they will have 10 minutes for quiet recreational reading. Use time
in this lesson to finish working with students who did not complete the Fluency
Assessment in the previous lesson.


You may also use Pausing Point days to administer the optional Tricky Word
Assessment included in the Teacher Resources to specific students that
you suspect may not have thoroughly mastered the Tricky Words and highfrequency words reviewed in this unit.


**Reading**

 - Consider preparing games used in previous lessons in this unit for review to
be available as an optional activity after assessments.


 - Gather books of varying complexity for students to choose from during SelfSustained Reading time.


 - Prepare copies of the Self-Sustained Reading Tracker (TR 14.4) for students.


**Spelling**

 - Provide colored pencils for students to use when checking and correcting
their spelling on Activity Page 15.2.


**Universal Access**

 - Provide audiobooks or books in students’ home languages as options for
recreational reading.


 - To gain additional information about students’ mastery of unit skills, provide

targeted practice to accelerate learning where errors occurred during the
Reading Assessment. Place Activity Page 15.1 in front of the student. Have
the student read the line(s) that contained the error. Then ask the student
to point and read the correct word for that line. The student’s oral response
will indicate whether the mistake was a careless error or if the student
needs additional instruction in specific letter-sound correspondences. If
the student makes more than six uncorrected mistakes, they are having
problems with word recognition and may need more practice decoding
specific spellings.

**I Have, Who Has?**

  - Move students into small groups. Pass out a set of I Have, Who Has cards
to each group. I Have, Who Has Cards are located at the end of this Pausing
Point section.


  - Explain the game:


    - Pass out the cards so that each student has the same number of cards.


    - Identify who has the first card (the card says: “I have the first card!” at
the top).


    - Explain that the first person will start the game by reading the question
on their card, beginning with “Who has . . .” Students then look at their
cards to see if one of their cards is a match.


    - The person with the correct word says, “I have . . .” followed by the word.
If they are correct, they continue the game by reading their “Who
has . . .” question. If they are incorrect, students keep looking for the
correct answer.


    - The game ends when students read the final card.


  - Before beginning, instruct students to read their cards to familiarize
themselves with their words and “Who has . . .” questions.


  - Release students to play the game. Groups can reshuffle the cards and play
again.


**Moon Shot**

  - Use the materials in the Additional Support Activity Pages section of the
Teacher Guide to play Moon Shot with words following a VCe pattern.


  - Move students into pairs. Provide each pair with a Moon Shot Game Board.


  - Provide each student with a set of Oh No! cards and a set of Good to Go!
cards. Provide small tokens as playing pieces.


  - Review the game instructions: Students take turns drawing word cards. If a
student reads the word correctly, he or she can draw a Good to Go! card and
follow the directions on the card.


  - If a student does not read the word correctly, he or she will draw a card from
the Oh No! pile and follow the directions on that card.

~~**MORE HELP WITH MULTISYLLABIC WORDS**~~


**Phonics Bingo**

 - Distribute Bingo cards and counters.


 - Explain that students are going to play Phonics Bingo to practice reading
multisyllabic words.


 - Demonstrate how the game works by drawing the top card from the word
stack and reciting it aloud while students check their game boards for the
word. Show students how to place a counter on top of the word on the board
as it is called out.


 - Hold up the card to show the correct word so that students can check their
answers.


 - Show students how to get an official “bingo” by getting a full line in any
direction on the board.


 - Begin the game.


 - The game is finished when one line is covered with counters and a student
says “Phonics Bingo!”.


**Knock Out**

 - Move students into pairs. Provide each pair with a Knock Out Game Board, a
set of Knock Out Word Cards, a whiteboard eraser, and two dice. Provide each
student with a whiteboard marker; each student must have a different color
marker from their partner.


 - Explain the game instructions:


   - Set a timer for 5 minutes.


   - One player rolls the dice.


   - That player picks up a card from the word card pile and read it aloud. The
player then finds the space on the game board that matches the number
rolled using the dice. The player writes the word in that space.


   - The next player rolls the dice and repeats the process.


   - If a player rolls a number of a space occupied with a word written by the
other player, they get to knock their opponent out by erasing their word
and replacing it with their word.


   - If a player rolls a number of a box that is already occupied with one of
their own words, they do not need to replace it.


Foundational Skills 4


   - Play continues until time is up. The player with the most boxes filled at
the end of time wins.


   - If students use up all the word cards before time is up, they should
reshuffle the deck and begin again.


 - Consider allowing students to swap partners after each round of the game.


~~**MORE HELP WITH SUFFIXES**~~


**Chaining Dictation**

 - Have students take out a pencil and a piece of paper.


 - Tell students you are going to say a number of words starting with a split

digraph base word. Each new word will be very similar to the previous word,
but the suffix will be different. (For example, liked might be changed to
liking.)


 - Tell students to write each word.





**Add Suffixes**




  - Provide students with Activity Page PP.1 for additional practice with correctly

spelling words with suffixes.


  - Ask students to fill in the blank with the word in parenthesis adding the
correct suffix.


  - Provide students with Activity Page PP.2 for additional practice with correctly

**Suffix Relay Race**


**Note:** This game can be played using any of the Activity Pages PP.1–PP.2.


 - Divide the class into teams of equal size. Each team should have an equal
number of students.


 - Place the Activity Page and pencils at one end of the racing area.


 - Line up each team at the other end of the area, opposite the Activity Page.


 - Explain to the students that they will be completing the worksheet as part of
a relay race.


 - When you say, "Go!" the first player from each team races to the Activity
Page area, grab the Activity Page and a pencil, and returns to their team.


 - The first player starts working on the first question of the worksheet.


 - Once the first player completes their question, they pass the Activity Page
and pencil to the next player in line.


 - The second player continues working on the next question, and so on, until
all questions on the Activity Page are completed.


 - The first team to complete all questions correctly and return the worksheet
to the designated spot wins the race.

cards. Create one set for each pair of students.


    - Divide students into pairs.


    - Give each pair a copy of the Swim to the Finish Game Board and a set of
word cards.


    - Have each student write their name or initials at the top of a column or
swim lane.


    - Explain the game:


    - Place cards facedown in a pile. Students take turns drawing a card and

                - The first one to the finish line wins! If both students read all their words
correctly, it will be a tie swim meet.


               - Have students play one full round of the game. If time allows, they can shuffle
the cards and play again, marking spaces with an ‘X’ or other marking of their
choice.


**Tricky Word Concentration**

                - On index cards, create two sets of Tricky Word cards. Select eight pairs of the
same words from each set. (You can increase the number of cards in each
game to provide a greater challenge.)


               - Shuffle the cards and lay them face down on the table, so there are four rows
of four cards each.


               - Have students turn over two cards at a time, attempting to find matching
cards. Each time a pair is turned over, the student must read each word.


               - If a student finds a match, they may keep the cards if they have read the
words correctly.


               - Let the game continue until all matches have been found. The person or team
with the most cards is the winner.

Grade 3 Foundational Skills Record


Teacher Instructions: Create one copy of the Foundational Skills Record per student. Use assessments
within the unit to track the student’s progress toward mastery of each standard. Use the rating system
to indicate the level of teacher support required and the space provided to take notes.


  - Students at level 1 require focused instruction to accelerate learning in a specific area. Use the
Additional Supports and Pausing Points to target areas of growth.


  - Students at levels 2 and 3 should be showing steady growth. These students would benefit from the
Take Home Materials and side-bar support suggestions within each lesson.


  - Students at level 4 are excelling. Use the side-bar challenge suggestions to increase rigor.

Grade 3 Fluency Record


Choose texts from the Grade 3 Fluency Packet or the Unit Readers for students to read aloud
as you measure their pace and accuracy. Subtract the Words Missed (words that are omitted,
mispronounced, or substituted for another word) from the Total Words in Text to determine the
number of Words Read Correctly. Divide the Words Read Correctly by the Total Words in Text to
determine the students’ accuracy. Record how long it takes the students to read the passage to
determine their Words Per Minute. Consider both accuracy and pace as well as expression when
evaluating a student’s overall fluency.

**Reading Assessment Scoring and Analysis**


The more words a student can read and the farther the student can progress in the
assessment, the stronger his or her preparation for the next unit of instruction.


The number of words read correctly indicates the following:


  - Students who score 6 or fewer words out of 10 words correctly have minimal preparation for the
next unit. Students who score 7 out of 10 words correctly have adequate preparation for the next
unit.


  - Students who score 8 or more words out of 10 words correctly have outstanding preparation for
the next unit.


After scoring the assessment, you might find it helpful to determine which phonemes students
missed that caused them to score below the benchmark for word recognition.

**Spelling Assessment Scoring and Analysis**

The words on today’s spelling assessment include the split digraphs ‘a_e’, ‘i_e’,
‘o_e’, and ‘u_e’ and consonant and vowel suffixes –ly, –ing, –ed, –able, and
–ful.


Place an X in the column of any word that the student did not spell correctly.
Examine errors for patterns using the information provided below. If a pattern
is identified, speak with the student and ask him or her to explain his or her
thinking to you. This may help you understand the student’s confusion and
allow you to clear up the misunderstanding.

**Tricky Word Assessment – Unit 3**

**(Optional)**


Student Name:


Instructions: This is an optional assessment of Tricky Words and high-frequency words reviewed in this unit. At the end of Unit 3, show the student the
Tricky Word List which follows this record. Ask the student to read each word
from the list, proceeding in order from top to bottom.


Provide the student with either a blank sheet of paper or card stock to place
on the word list page directly under the row he or she is reading. As the student completes a row, he or she should slide the paper down just enough to
read the next row.


Record the student’s performance on each word in the following chart, using
+ to indicate that the word was read correctly and – to indicate the word was
read incorrectly; if the student misreads a completely different word in its
place, record the word read by the student. Mark as incorrect any word that
the student does not read within 3–5 seconds.

**Appendix A:**
Overview of the Grade 3
Skills Program


~~**THE SIMPLE VIEW OF READING**~~


Virtually everyone who writes about reading now recognizes that reading comprehension requires
more than just decoding ability. Many reading researchers now subscribe to a view of reading that
is known as “the simple view of reading.” This view, which is associated with reading researchers
Philip Gough and William Tunmer, holds that there are two chief elements that are crucially
important to reading comprehension: decoding skills and language comprehension ability.


To achieve reading comprehension, a person needs to be able to decode the words on the page and
then make sense of those words. The first task is made possible by decoding skills and the second
by language comprehension ability. If the person cannot decode the words on the page, she will not
be able to achieve reading comprehension, no matter how much oral language she can understand.
Even if the person can decode the words on the page, that in and of itself is still no guarantee of
reading comprehension. Thus, if a person cannot understand sentences when they hear them,
they are unlikely to understand those sentences when reading. Supporters of the simple view—and
there are a growing number of them among reading researchers—argue that a person’s reading
comprehension ability can be predicted, with a high degree of accuracy, based on two basic
measures. The first is a measure of decoding skills (e.g., a test of single word reading or pseudoword reading). The second is a measure of listening comprehension. Researchers who hold to the
simple view say, “Tell me a person’s decoding ability, as ascertained by a word-reading task, and
tell me that person’s language comprehension ability, as ascertained by a listening comprehension
task, and I can make a very accurate prediction of that person’s reading comprehension ability.” If
the person is a rapid and accurate decoder and able to understand a wide range of oral language—
for instance, classroom presentations, news items on the radio or TV, books on tape, etc.—then it is
a safe bet the person will also do well on tests of reading comprehension.


An interesting thing about the simple view of reading is that it can be expressed as an equation:





In this equation, each of the letters is a variable that stands for a specific skill:


R is a measure of reading comprehension ability.


D is a measure of decoding skills.


C is a measure of language-comprehension ability as measured using a listening task.


**306** Foundational Skills 2


Each of these skills can be quantified as a numerical value between 0 and 1, where 0 stands for no
ability whatsoever and 1 stands for perfect, not-to-be-improved-upon ability. Most people have a
skill level that falls somewhere between these two extremes.


The equation says that if you have some decoding ability (D > 0) and you also have some language
comprehension ability (C > 0), you will probably also have some reading comprehension ability (R

  - 0). How much reading comprehension ability you have will depend on the exact values of D and
C.


What does it mean to have no decoding ability (D = 0)? It means you cannot turn printed words
into spoken words. A person who cannot decode letters on a page cannot read. The person is
illiterate.


What does it mean to have no language comprehension ability (C = 0)? It means you do not know
the language, and you cannot understand any of it when you hear other people speaking or reading
aloud in that language.


It is not very common for a person to have decoding ability (D > 0) but not language
comprehension ability (C = 0). Why would you learn to read and write a language you cannot
understand? It does happen. One famous example involves the English poet John Milton, the
author of _Paradise Lost_ and other well-known poems. Milton went blind late in life. Since Braille had
not yet been invented, this meant he could not read for himself. Nevertheless, Milton found a way
to keep learning from books: he had friends and relatives read the books aloud for him. However,
he was not always able to find a scholar who had the free time and the ability needed to read to him
in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and other ancient languages. The solution? Milton taught his daughters
to decode these languages so they could read books in those languages aloud to him. Milton did
not teach his daughters the actual languages—the thousands of words and tens of thousands
of meanings. That would have been a difficult, time-consuming task. He only taught them the
rules they would need to turn letters into sounds. Thus, his daughters acquired solid decoding
skills for these languages (D > 0), but they would have scored a zero on any measure of language
comprehension (C = 0). They could turn symbols into sounds, but they had no idea what the
sounds meant. Milton, on the other hand, due to his blindness, had no functional decoding skills (D
= 0). However, by virtue of his great learning, he was able to understand Hebrew, Latin, and Greek
when they were read aloud to him (C > 0). Between Milton and his daughters, you might say, there
was reading comprehension (R), but the younger generation brought the decoding skills (D) and
the elderly poet brought the language comprehension (C).


The Milton example is an unusual one, but it is possible to give a less unusual one. A decent teacher
can teach you to decode Russian letters (or the letters used in many other writing systems) during
a couple days of intensive work. Since you already know a lot about reading, all you would need to
learn is which sound values the unfamiliar letters stand for. Once you learned that, you would be
able to sound out most of the words in the language, but nobody would claim that you are reading
Russian. You would have some rudimentary decoding skills (D > 0), but you would be lacking
language comprehension (C = 0). You would be able to pronounce words, but you would not be able
to make sense of them. Essentially, you would be doing what Milton’s daughters did.


Teacher Resources **307**


~~**HOW THESE IDEAS INFORM THIS PROGRAM**~~


Although this may seem very abstract and theoretical, there are two ideas here that are very
important for reading instruction and for understanding this program. The first important idea
is that reading comprehension depends crucially on both decoding skills (D) and language
comprehension ability (C); the second is that language comprehension ability takes much longer
to acquire than decoding skills.


Milton chose to teach his daughters decoding skills because he could teach those relatively
quickly. It would have taken him much, much longer to build up their language comprehension
abilities. Likewise, in the hypothetical example just given, a decent teacher could teach you to
decode Russian print in a few days of intensive instruction, but he or she would need to keep
working with you for many weeks—possibly even many years—to teach you enough Russian words
and phrases to understand a movie, make sense of a radio report, or read a short story.


You are facing a similar situation as a teacher in the early grades. You want your students to learn
to read. A crucial first step is to teach them decoding skills. Strong decoding skills can be taught
to most young children throughout Grades K–3. It takes longer to teach decoding skills to young
children who are learning to read for the first time than it does to teach the same skills to adults
who have already learned to read in another language, and it takes longer to teach decoding
skills in English-speaking countries because English spelling is rather complex; but even so,
most students can acquire basic decoding ability in the early grades. The children will continue
to automatize their decoding skills, learn new spelling patterns, and build fluency for many more
years, but the basics can be taught in Grades K–3.


That is not the case with language comprehension ability. It will take you and your school system
a long time to build up your students’ language comprehension ability because this is not a job
you can accomplish in a single school year. Rather, language comprehension ability is acquired
over many years. Your students began to develop a rudimentary ability to understand language
even before they could speak and continued to increase their language comprehension abilities
throughout the preschool years. They will make even more gains in your classroom and the
classrooms they join after yours. With each new sentence they read or hear, and each new subject
they study in school, they will be building up background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural
literacy, thus increasing the range of materials they are equipped to understand, first orally and
later via reading. The more you teach them and the more you expose them to, the more they will be
able to understand. It takes a long time to build up the vocabulary and knowledge needed to make
sense of most stories in a newspaper or magazine, but this buildup is crucial for your students’
reading abilities: no matter how good their decoding skills may be, they will not understand what
they read unless they have the language comprehension ability to make sense of the words they
decode.


The program includes two strands of instruction, and these strands correspond with the
elements of reading isolated in the simple view of reading. The Skills Strand is meant to build
students’ decoding skills (D), while the Knowledge Strand is meant to build students’ language
comprehension ability (C) by exposing them to vocabulary, concepts, and ideas through


**308** Foundational Skills 2


frequent reading aloud. It is important to understand that both strands are crucial for reading
comprehension in later grades. You may feel the decoding skills taught in the Skills Strand are
more important to teach in the early grades, and certainly, this is the area where you can expect to
have the most immediate impact, but it is important that you not neglect language comprehension
ability. Remember, it takes many years to build up enough vocabulary and general knowledge to
understand a wide range of printed materials. The building of background knowledge needs to
begin in kindergarten (if not before) and continue throughout the elementary and middle school
years.


If students are not building their language comprehension ability in the early grades, their reading
scores are likely to begin to fall off in Grade 4 and later. This has been called the “fourth-grade
slump,” and it occurs because material assessed on reading tests changes over time. As students’
progress through the grades, test questions focus less on rudimentary decoding skills and more
on comprehension—and comprehension depends on having sufficient vocabulary, background
knowledge, and cultural literacy to understand the words you are decoding. Thus, the importance
of language comprehension ability increases with time. A weakness in this area may not show up
on tests in early grades, but it will show up in later elementary grades.


This has been well documented in research. In one very interesting study, researchers at the
University of Kansas looked at measurements of reading comprehension (R), decoding/word
recognition (D), and listening comprehension (C) for the same 570 students in the second, fourth,
and eighth grades. They found the two factors D and C accurately predicted R in each grade,
but that C became more important, in the sense that it explained more of the variation among
students over time. The measure of decoding (D) was extremely important in the second-grade
results. Twenty-seven percent of the variance in reading comprehension in second grade could
be explained by decoding skills (D) alone. Only 9 percent of the variance could be explained
by listening comprehension (C) alone. By fourth grade, however, the measure of listening
comprehension had begun to account for more variance: the unique contribution of C rose to 21
percent, while the equivalent number for D fell. By eighth grade, fully 36 percent of the variance
in reading comprehension scores could be explained with reference to the children’s listening
comprehension ability. The unique contribution of D sank even further. In other words, while
reading comprehension depended on D and C at every stage, as the simple view would predict,
C explained more and more of the variation among students as time went by. What this tells us
is that, once the intricacies of decoding are mastered (and in English, this takes some time),
reading comprehension depends more and more heavily on language comprehension. Language
comprehension depends on background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural literacy.


~~**TWO MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT READING AND WRITING**~~


The Skills Strand teaches the mechanics of both reading and writing. It is based on the most
current research on reading and writing, but at the same time, it has been written in opposition to
some ideas that have been very influential in elementary education in recent decades. Two of those
ideas are:


Learning to read and write is natural.


Teacher Resources **309**


Learning to read and write is easy.


Both ideas have great emotional appeal. Unfortunately, both are wrong.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT NATURAL**~~


Many scholars have argued that spoken language is natural for human beings. The cognitive
scientist Stephen Pinker, for example, has argued that human beings have a language instinct,
meaning that humans are born with an innate capacity for learning language. This may turn out to
be true. It is at least a plausible theory since historians, linguists, and anthropologists have never
found a human culture that does not use language. When something is universal, it may turn out to
be natural.


What is true of oral language is not necessarily true of written language. In fact, with written
language, we know we are dealing with something that is not natural or innate because we know
when and where writing was invented, and we know that, even today, not all languages have a
system of writing. There are still hundreds of languages in the world that are spoken but not
written or read.


Ten thousand years ago this was the norm rather than an exception. At that time, there were
probably no human beings who knew how to read or write. According to the linguist Florian
Coulmas, the idea of writing down language was probably developed independently by three
ancient cultures: the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, and the Chinese. Each used a slightly different
system, and the mechanisms these pioneers developed for recording speech then spread from one
culture to another, evolving as they went. If these initial inventors had not come up with schemes
for writing down speech, we might all be illiterate today.


Writing is many things. It is an art that can be taught and learned. It is an invention—one of the
greatest inventions in human history. It is a technology enabling us to do things we could not do
without it—a technology every bit as exciting and amazing as airplane flight or electric power. But
it is not natural. The same is true of reading, which is simply the process of unpacking, or decoding,
what somebody else has written.


Reading and writing are both highly artificial. We tend to recoil at that word. We have internalized
the idea that natural is good and artificial is bad. Therefore, we think reading must be natural. In
fact, as the reading researcher Philip Gough has written, reading is a highly unnatural act.


The first step toward good reading and writing instruction is to understand that reading and
writing are artificial—but not necessarily in a bad sense. We need to remind ourselves that the
word artificial derives from the word art. To say reading and writing are forms of art that had to be
invented and need to be taught to children does not make reading and writing any less wonderful
or important. On the contrary, it makes these things more wonderful and precious, and it also
emphasizes the importance of your job as a teacher. There is no job more important than teaching
young children the magnificent, valuable, and highly unnatural arts of reading and writing.


**310** Foundational Skills 2


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT EASY**~~


The second idea noted earlier, that learning to read and write is easy, is also mistaken. Reading and
writing are complex behaviors, and they are more complex in English than in many other languages
because English has a complicated spelling system. In Spanish, for example, the relationships
between letters and sounds are mostly one-to-one, meaning each sound is usually written with
one spelling, and each spelling unit is usually pronounced one way. This is not the case in English.
To read and write English with a high degree of accuracy, there is quite a lot that students need to
learn.


As a way of demonstrating the complexity involved in learning to read and write in English, suppose
we attempted to list all the discrete bits of information a person needs to know to be able to read
and write in English. As a starting point, we might begin with the 26 letters and argue that these
are the 26 things one really needs to learn to read and write English. However, for each letter, one
eventually needs to learn not only the letter shape but also the letter name (to be able to read
abbreviations and initials). So that is 52 bits of information.


That is a good start, but we must not stop there. In English, all letters can be written in uppercase
and lowercase forms, and the uppercase forms are not always the same as the lowercase forms.
Compare ‘B’ to ‘b,’ ‘D’ to ‘d,’ ‘H’ to ‘h,’ ‘R’ to ‘r,’ and ‘Q’ to ‘q.’ At least 16 uppercase letters have a
slightly different form than the matching lowercase letters. So, we must raise our estimate of the
complexity of the English writing system to 68 bits of information.


We are not done yet. Students must also know the 44 sounds these letters stand for. That raises
our estimate of the complexity to 112.


If there was a simple one-to-one relationship between letters and sounds, that might be a good
estimate of the code’s complexity. Unfortunately, the relationships between sounds and letters in
English are quite complicated. The 44 sounds of English can be spelled many ways. In our work on
this program, we have identified 150 spellings that are frequent enough to be worth teaching in the
early grades. That boosts our estimate of the complexity of the code to 262.


In addition, students need to learn to track from left to right, blend sounds into words (when
reading), and segment words into sounds (when writing and spelling). They need to learn a handful
of symbols used in writing, including the period, comma, exclamation point, question mark,
quotation mark, and apostrophe. That raises our estimate of code complexity to about 270 bits of
information.


We could boost the estimate even higher by adding Tricky Words and unusual spellings or by
pointing out that many letters in English can be pronounced in different ways. We could also point
out that reading a word like _thin_ requires students to group the first two letters and attach them to
one sound, and reading a word like _cake_ requires students to scan ahead, see the ‘e,’ and realize it
controls the pronunciation of the ‘a’ earlier.


Even without these additions, the English writing system is quite complicated.

~~**THE PROBLEM WITH WHOLE LANGUAGE**~~


On a conservative estimate, there are 270 bits of knowledge a person needs to be able to read and
write English. It is unwise to ask students to tackle all this complexity at once and hope they will
figure it out. Yet that is precisely what is done in so-called “Whole Language” approaches. Whole
Language instruction is based on the assumption that learning to read is natural and not difficult,
so reading skills can be allowed to develop gradually, without much explicit instruction. Lots of
students in Whole Language classrooms do manage to figure out the English writing system, but
many others do not. Whole Language ideas have tremendous emotional appeal, but the Whole
Language approach is actually a recipe for leaving many children behind. It is an especially risky
strategy for disadvantaged children.


A much better strategy is to introduce the English spelling code explicitly, beginning with the
easiest, least ambiguous, and most frequently used parts of the code and then adding complexity
gradually. That is the central strategy on which this program is based.


The strategy adopted in this program is the same strategy that successful coaches use when
teaching children a sport such as tennis. The successful coach does not ask students to learn
“Whole Tennis” and soak up the necessary skills all at once by trying to hit all different kinds of
shots the first day on the court. Instead, the successful coach teaches the student to hit a forehand
ground stroke and provides lots of practice hitting forehands. Then the coach moves on to teach
a backhand ground stroke, then a forehand volley, then a backhand volley, then a serve, then an
overhead smash, then a drop shot, etc. With each element taught, the student becomes a stronger
and more complete player. In the same way, this program begins by teaching the most common
and least ambiguous spellings for sounds and then moves on to introduce the more complex parts
of the writing system.


~~**KEY ASPECTS OF THE SKILLS STRAND**~~


Some key aspects of the Skills Strand are listed below.


  - This program teaches reading and writing in tandem, since they are inverse processes. English
writing involves making pictures of sounds; reading involves translating those pictures back into
sounds and blending the sounds to make words.


  - This program includes explicit, systematic phonics instruction in which students are taught target
skills needed to independently decode and encode words This program explicitly teaches lettersound correspondences as opposed to leaving students to figure these out on their own or deduce
them by analyzing familiar whole words (as in some forms of “analytic” phonics).


  - This program focuses on sounds, or phonemes, as the primary organizing principle of the program,
rather than letters.


  - This program focuses consistently on the phoneme, or single sound, and not on larger units.
Students learn to read words that contain onsets, rimes, and consonant clusters, but they learn to
view and process these larger units as combinations of smaller phoneme-level units. Rimes like -ick
and initial clusters like st- are not taught as units but as combinations.


**312** Foundational Skills 2


  - This program uses a synthetic phonics approach that teaches students to read by blending through
the whole word; it does not teach multiple cueing strategies, use of pictures as a primary resource in
decoding, or part-word guessing.


  - This program begins by teaching the most common or least ambiguous spelling for a sound (the
basic code spelling); later it teaches spelling alternatives for sounds that can be spelled several
different ways. Thus, the system is kept simple at first, and complexity is added bit by bit as
students gain confidence and automatize their reading and writing skills.


  - This program includes words, phrases, and stories for students to read and activity pages for
them to complete that allow for focused, distributed practice working with the letter-sound
correspondences they have been taught.


  - This program does not require students to read words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have learned. In other words, all words students are asked to read as
part of the program are decodable, either because they are composed entirely of letter-sound
correspondences students have been taught or because they are Tricky Words that have been
taught. This means students have a chance to begin reading words and stories that are completely
decodable before tackling words and stories that are full of spelling alternatives.


  - This program does not require students to write words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have been taught. In other words, students are only asked to write words that
can be spelled (at least plausibly if not always correctly) using the code knowledge they have been
taught.


  - This program carefully controls the introduction of Tricky Words and words with ambiguous or rare
spellings, preferring to have students learn to read and write with regular words that can be blended
and spelled by the letter-sound correspondences taught.


  - High-frequency words compiled from a research-based list for Grade 3 are also taught as they
appear in the Unit Readers. They are revisited frequently to build automaticity and fluency.


  - This program avoids letter names because what is important for reading is not the letter name but
the sound value the letter stands for. To read the word cat, it is essential to know /k/ /a/ /t/, not
“see aay tee.”


~~**THE BASIC AND ADVANCED CODE**~~


The program teaches the highly complex letter-sound correspondences of the English language
in an explicit and systematic manner in Kindergarten–Grade 3. Students are taught how the 26
letters (or graphemes) of the alphabet are used in various combinations to represent 44 sounds
(or phonemes). There are approximately 150 different spellings for these sounds.


Students are first taught the basic code for each of the 44 phonemes. The basic code spelling for
a sound is usually the most common, or the least ambiguous, spelling for a sound. By learning
these letter-sound correspondences first, students experience a high degree of predictability, and
therefore success, in decoding words with these spellings.


Teacher Resources **313**


Basic code spellings may be single letters, such as these spellings and sounds: ‘a’ > /a/, ‘e’ > /e/,
‘b’ > /b/, and ‘m’ > /m/. Basic code spellings may also include digraphs, or two letters to represent
a sound, such as ‘ee’ > /ee/, ‘oy’ > /oi/, ‘ou’ > /ow/, ‘sh’ > /sh/, and ‘th’ > /th/. Other basic code
spellings include separated digraphs, such as ‘a_e’ > /ae/, and ‘o_e’ > /oe/.


The advanced code consists of all other spelling alternatives (over 100) that may be used to spell
the 44 phonemes in English. Examples of alternative spellings include ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘ss’ > /s/, ‘c’

 - /s/, ‘g’ > /j/, ‘ay’ > /ae/, and ‘ey’ > /ee/. Some of these spelling alternatives occur relatively
frequently in the English language, while others are quite rare. See the charts provided for the
basic and advanced code.

The term _Tricky Word_ is used in this program to refer to a word that does not “play by the rules” of
spelling and/or pronunciation. Examples of Tricky Words include _one_, _said_, _of_, _were_, and _have_ .


You can describe the trickiness of a Tricky Word like _said_ in two ways. If you think about it from
a spelling point of view, you might say that the word _said_ is tricky because the sound /e/ is not
spelled with an ‘e,’ as you might expect it would be. On the other hand, if you think about it from a
reading point of view, you might say the word is tricky because the letters ‘ai’ are not pronounced
/ae/, as you might expect they would be. Either way you look at it, _said_ is a Tricky Word.


But notice that the word is not completely irregular, either. The first letter and the last letter are
pronounced exactly as you would expect. It is only the second and third letters, representing the
vowel sound, that are not sounded as you would expect. Or, if you prefer to look at things from the
speller’s perspective, you might say the first and last sound are spelled just as you would expect; it
is only the middle sound—the vowel sound—that is spelled irregularly. This is the case with many
Tricky Words: most of them have a regular part (or parts) and then a tricky part. You will find that
the tricky part involves the vowel sound and its spelling.


Teacher Resources **315**


When you are asked to teach a Tricky Word, the guidelines in the Teacher Guide will generally
prompt you to begin by reminding students that not all words play by the rules and words that do
not play by the rules are called Tricky Words. Next, the Teacher Guide generally suggests you write
the Tricky Word on the board. You may wish to ask a student to read the word as he or she thinks it
might be sounded (i.e., to blend according to the normal procedures). Alternatively, you can read
Tricky Word that way yourself. Then you can point out how the word is pronounced. Once you have
established the actual pronunciation, you can point out and/or discuss what is regular and what
is irregular about the word. Most Tricky Words have at least some parts pronounced exactly the
way you would expect. For example, as noted above, the first and last letter in _said_ are pronounced
just as one would expect. After discussing the regular parts, you should then draw attention to the
tricky part (or parts) of the word, pointing out letters not pronounced as one might expect they
would be (e.g., the ‘ai’ in _said_ ). This is the part of the word that students just must remember.


By drawing attention to the regular as well as the irregular parts of the word, you teach students
that Tricky Words are only partial exceptions to the normal rules of reading and writing. (They are
not so much irregular as they are a little less regular than most words.) There are some parts of
the word spelled as you would expect and pronounced as expected. Then there are some others
that are not. There is a subtle but important difference between teaching Tricky Words this way and
teaching them as single entities that must be memorized as wholes, as if every part of the word
were unpredictable.


Note that some Tricky Words are part of spelling patterns. For example, the words _he_, _she_, _we_,
_be_, and _me_ are taught as Tricky Words in earlier grades because it is hard to write stories without
them. However, once the ‘e’ spelling alternative for /ee/ is taught, these Tricky Words can be seen
as part of a larger pattern that includes words like _replay_ and _prefix_ . Other Tricky Words, such as
_one_ and _of_, remain tricky even when most of the spelling alternatives have been taught. By Grade
3, students have been taught the majority of the code knowledge needed to decode most words in
the English language. As such, there is less of an emphasis on Tricky Words in the Grade 3 program.


~~**SIGHT WORDS AND TRICKY WORDS**~~


One of the most common terms in the world of reading instruction is _sight word_ . Unfortunately, this
is also a rather ambiguous and potentially confusing term. Educators use the term sight word in
two different senses. For some people, sight words are high-frequency words that students need to
encounter frequently and learn to decode rapidly and effortlessly. Other people use the term sight
word in a more restrictive sense, to refer to words that cannot be sounded out using letter-sound
correspondences and may need to be taught as exceptions.


In this program, we define these terms as follows:


  - A Tricky Word is a word that does not play by the rules. It is a word containing at least one part that
cannot be read correctly via blending or cannot be spelled correctly using the code knowledge
taught so far.


  - A sight word is a high-frequency word that we want students to see many, many times and learn to
read quickly and eventually learn to recognize rapidly.


**316** Foundational Skills 2


The main difference here is that a Tricky Word always contains some irregular element, whereas a
sight word might or might not. The Venn diagram below shows the relationship between these two
categories, as understood within this program.

|Tricky Words|Overlap|Sight Words|
|---|---|---|
|colonel, aisle, Aarol, ballet|of, to, once, one, was, who, said|in, it, at, on, if, then, this, did, and, with|



The words in the left circle are Tricky Words: each one contains at least one set of letters that is not
pronounced the way you would expect. Or, if you prefer to look at matters from a spelling point of
view, you could say each contains at least one sound that is not written as you would expect it to
be.


The words in the right circle are sight words: they are all high-frequency words that students
should see frequently and eventually learn to recognize rapidly.


The shaded area in the middle shows that there is considerable overlap between the two categories
(which is probably why the two senses of _sight word_ are regularly confused). Some words qualify
as sight words because they are used a lot and as Tricky Words because they are not pronounced
(or written) as you would expect. These are irregular words (and therefore hard to read and write,
at least at first) and very common (and important for student success). They are candidates for
special instruction, and many of them are given special instruction in this program.


The area on the far left shows words that are tricky in the sense that they depart from the most
common spelling patterns. But these words do not qualify as sight words on most lists because
they are not especially common. Words of this sort are sprinkled throughout the language but do
not receive much attention because they are only used occasionally. Students can learn them as
the need arises in upper grades.


The area on the far right shows words that qualify as sight words because they are very common
and should be rapidly recognized but do not qualify as Tricky Words because they are completely
regular. All of them are pronounced and spelled exactly as you would expect. They can be sounded
out and set down on paper using basic letter-sound correspondences taught in Kindergarten.
Students need to see these words—and they will see most of them frequently in the materials—but
you probably do not need to give these words special attention, and you certainly should not ask
students to memorize them as wholes. Students can simply read them by sounding them out. After
sounding them out several times, they will begin to recognize them more rapidly. In other words, no
special teaching is required for these regular high-frequency words. All that is required is multiple
exposures, and students are likely to get multiple exposures since the words are so common.


~~**SIGHT WORDS**~~


The guidelines for teaching Tricky Words are outlined in the section above. As noted above, we use
the term sight word in this program to refer to high-frequency words that we want students to see
many, many times and learn to recognize rapidly.


Teacher Resources **317**


The program does place the initial emphasis on reading regular words. But that does not mean
high-frequency sight words are not being learned. In fact, as noted above, many sight words are
completely regular and become decodable as students learn letter-sound correspondences. This
means that the program is a very effective program for teaching sight words.


To illustrate this, consider one of the most widely used lists of sight words, Dr. Edward Fry’s
“Instant Word” list. Fry’s list is divided into groups of 100. For illustration purposes, we will focus
on the first three lists of 100 words, 300 words in all. These are words that Fry recommends be
mastered in the first several grades of school. We found more than half of the Fry Instant Words
become fully decodable in kindergarten, meaning they are either regular and can be sounded out
using the letter-sound correspondences taught, or they are Tricky Words explicitly taught in the
program.


**HIGH-FREQUENCY WORDS**


In addition to addressing Tricky Words and tricky spellings, this program emphasizes the reading
and spelling of high-frequency words carefully selected from word lists compiled by researchers
Edward William Dolch and Edward Fry. These lists are instrumental in aiding students, particularly
young learners, to become more proficient readers by focusing on words that frequently appear in
English reading materials.


Specifically for grade 3 students, the lists include 132 words, of which this program provides
explicit instruction for 98. These words are selected based on their prevalence across various unit
Readers, ensuring instruction is both relevant and practical. Instruction is integrated into lessons
at points where students will naturally encounter these words within the assigned sections of the
Readers.


The program encourages students to identify and recall previously taught high-frequency words
to reinforce learning, thereby gradually expanding their lexicon through repeated exposure. This
strategic approach ensures that students learn to recognize and use these essential words and
improve their reading fluency and comprehension.


The process for determining which high-frequency words to teach and the timing of their
introduction is structured and integral to the curriculum, designed to optimize comprehension
and retention. Each unit focuses on 8-12 high-frequency words. These words are carefully selected
based on their relevance as content words central to the unit’s Reader and their frequent usage
throughout the Reader. To facilitate learning, these words are introduced by sounding them out and
employing Spelling Cards, which aid in decoding.


As the unit progresses, the high-frequency words highlighted in the Reading section of each
lesson are consistently reviewed, ensuring recognition and understanding of these words both in
and out of context. To reinforce learning and maintain engagement, focused high-frequency word
decode/encode games found in the Reading section are incorporated every few days, strategically
reviewing one-third of the previously encountered words to reinforce retention.


**318** Foundational Skills 2


To further consolidate learning, a final high-frequency word game that reviews all the words
introduced in the unit is played at designated Pausing Points, ensuring multiple opportunities
to interact with and master these words. Additionally, fluency checkpoints are conducted to
monitor progress in automaticity and fluency, essential components of reading proficiency. This
comprehensive approach ensures that students are not only exposed to high-frequency words but
also engage with them in a variety of contexts, enhancing reading skills and confidence.

|Unit|High Frequency Word Scope and Sequence|

|1|night, about, tree, story, thought, every, began, hard, important, river, small, near|
|2|talk, walk, head, eyes, book, being, run, drink, long, much, keep, group|

|10|eight, school, enough, show, watch, song, almost, list|



~~**CUSTOMIZING AND ADAPTING THE PROGRAM**~~


This is a highly structured and sequenced program. We are unapologetic about that, as we believe
the structure and sequence will be very helpful to students as they work to learn the English
spelling code. However, this is not a scripted program in which teachers are required to read
the manual and give one of a handful of approved responses. We expect—indeed, we hope—
teachers will tweak the phrasing and come up with ways to customize, personalize, and adapt the
instruction.


Our goal has been to put things in a logical order and provide all the guidance and support
necessary for a new teacher, or a teacher new to this kind of phonics instruction.


At the same time, we believe there is room for experienced and creative teachers to customize
and adapt the program. Indeed, some of the exercises included in this version of the program were
developed by teachers in our pilot programs!


Sometimes in the lessons, we give exact phrasing that we suggest you use; more often, however,
we give indirect phrasing and/or encourage you to explain something using your own words. You
should feel free to make changes to the phrasing. For example, you may prefer to speak of “a
picture of a sound” or a “spelling.” Later in the year, you may want to teach the term digraph, or
you may prefer to refer to the letters in a digraph as a “letter team” or as “buddy letters.” There are
many ways to customize the program and the language while preserving the basic instructional
principles and sequence of instruction.


For the presentation of words, you may write on a chalkboard, a whiteboard, chart paper, an


Teacher Resources **319**


overhead projector, a document camera, or the projection system of your choice. A projection
system works especially well for activity pages since it allows the teacher to model the task exactly
as the students will be completing it. You may use a pocket chart, a magnetic board with magnetic
letters, an overhead projector with letters cut from a transparency, or a smart board. Many
modifications of this sort can be made without adversely impacting the quality of the instruction.


You should also always feel free to add additional activities and activity pages that are consistent
with our philosophy of instruction. You should always feel free to respond to the teachable
moment, even if it leads you slightly off the path laid out in the Teacher Guide.


There are only a handful of things you should not do:


You should not skip a lesson in which new code knowledge is taught. If you do, students will lack
important code knowledge, untaught spellings will begin to appear in their word lists and on their
activity pages, and the lessons will start to make less sense to them.


For the same reasons, you should not reorder the lessons. The program relies heavily on
sequencing, and instruction will be confused and less effective if the lessons are reordered.


~~**SMALL-GROUP WORK**~~


Large parts of this program have been written for whole-group instruction, but the program can
be customized to allow for small-group instruction of various kinds. You will note that there are
Support and Challenge sidebars sprinkled throughout the lessons that will guide you in how to
differentiate instruction for your students, while still using the whole-class approach described in
the lessons.


Since some students will learn the new information right away while others will need more practice,
you may wish to do small-group work to follow up the initial introduction of code knowledge.
You will note that many lessons do include suggestions for small groups; you should feel free to
adapt to these and other lessons as they best meet the needs of your students. We have seen this
program taught very effectively in small groups and in workstations students visit on rotation.


~~**ADJUSTING THE SPEED OF INSTRUCTION**~~


This sequence will work for most children. However, all children are different, and all classrooms
are different. Some classrooms may need more time to master concepts than others. The program
has been designed so the pace of instruction can be adjusted as needed.


The most important thing for you to know is that you can pause at any point in the program.
If students are not learning the material, simply stop where you are and do additional work to
accelerate or reteach as needed. All lessons contain some materials you can use if you pause.


In addition, at the end of each unit there is a “Pausing Point.” If the end-of-unit assessment or your


**320** Foundational Skills 2


observations suggest some members of the class need additional time to master the concepts
taught in the unit, this is an especially good place to stop and provide additional practice and
review. The Teacher Guides include additional work at each Pausing Point. They will typically
provide enough for at least 1–2 days of additional work. The materials provided in the Pausing
Point can be used in various ways. Sometimes you may wish to have all students do the same
activity or activity page. At other times you may wish to work individually or in small groups with
students who need additional help with a particular concept.


To slow down instruction, you can pause either in the middle of a unit or at a Pausing Point. We do
not recommend that you attempt to speed up the sequence of instruction. The program lays out an
ambitious program of instruction.


The Grade 3 program of instruction should work well for a wide range of students. You should begin
with the assumption that the Grade 3 program is an appropriate option for all students in the class.


Inevitably, however, there will be differences in learning. Students learn at different rates. Some
students will pick up the material quickly; others will have more difficulty. There are many
strategies for dealing with this. In general, we encourage you to try to keep most of the class
together if it makes sense. It is much easier to teach one set of students at roughly the same level
than it is to teach two or three groups at very different levels.


If you find some students are lagging, you may still be able to keep the class together for the main
lessons but find extra time two to four times a week to work with those students who seem to need
extra practice.


If this is not sufficient, you may eventually need to regroup some students. As we note in Lessons
4–5 of this unit, it is especially important to administer the placement assessment to all students
at the start of the year. We strongly recommend that teachers then use an “across grade” approach
to grouping students. If there are two classrooms, these two teachers should look at all of the
Grade 3 students in both classrooms and consider regrouping students for Skills instruction only,
with one teacher taking the class of students who need review and more practice, while the other
teacher works with those students ready to move on to Grade 3 Skills instruction. It will likely be
worthwhile to reconvene at multiple times during the year to plan across the grade level, using the
end-of-unit assessments. In this way, students in need of additional support can be moved to the
appropriate group, while students who are making progress can advance.

**Appendix C:**
Using Chunking to Decode
Multisyllable Words


Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught will enable students to read one
syllable word with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences is no
guarantee that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllabic words. To this
end, most students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk and read
parts of words—syllables—to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can
then be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated, and students are
expected to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, the program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the
easiest two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is
already a familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In
addition, each syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic
familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing_, _hunt·er_, _bust·ed_ ).
The dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain doubleletter spellings for consonants, in this program, the divider is typically placed after the doubleletter spelling rather than between the two consonants (e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers
that are familiar with other ways to chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is
done, however, because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single-spelling units
since kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.). The program strives to be consistent in
representing these spellings in the way that the students have been taught to process them (e.g.,
as whole entities for a sound). (Ultimately, as students become more proficient at decoding and
chunking syllables through subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually
chunk and decode these words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding
these two-syllable words consisting of root words and suffixes relatively easy.


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable
words.


**328** Foundational Skills 2


To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


   - **Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound (e.g.,**
**/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/):** _let, pad, rod, tin, fun, pic·nic, un·til_


   - **Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /**
**ie/, /oe/, /ue/):** _cake, home, like, mule, Pete, mis·take, stam·pede_


   - **Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint, speak, proud, play, dis·may, be·low, coun·sel_


   - **R-Controlled Syllables:** _art, curb, girl, fort, clerk, tur·nip, ar·tist, fe·ver_


   - **Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /ie/,**
**/oe/, /ue/):** _go, me, hi, a·pron, fi·nal, com·pre·hend_


   - **Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple, puz·zle, raf·fle, ca·ble, ri·fle_


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


   - _Schwa Syllables:_ ben·e·fit, ap·pe·tite, a·bout, hos·pit·al, e·mo·tion


**Note:** The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately
because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


To decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these names. The names of the
syllable types are provided here only to establish a common vocabulary for teachers as they use
the materials. What is necessary, however, for students to become fluent readers of longer words in
increasingly complex text is that they be able to visually parse certain spelling patterns as syllable
chunks so they can quickly and easily decode each syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


  - When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.
_ad·mit_ _nap·kin_ _trum·pet_


  - For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed
after the double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is
because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units since kindergarten
(‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).
_traff·ic_ _muff·in_ _happ·en_


Teacher Resources **329**


  - When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.
_mon·ster_ _con·tract_ _pil·grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read
the first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model
for students how to blend the two syllables aloud:


  - In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the magic
‘E’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


  - Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for closed
syllables:
_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


  - In Grades 2 and 3, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to
use a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying
each possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


  - When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:
_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_


**330** Foundational Skills 2


However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There
is no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be
flexible and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to
determine whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. To recognize
whether a word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has
heard before (i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent
an additional challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a
second language.


   - If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:

_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is straightforward.


  - When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings
in the words.
_ban · gle_ _twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_


In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings
represent the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a
combination of stressed and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed
or weakly stressed, its vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that
linguists call a schwa. This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include


Teacher Resources **331**


‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’ and ‘tion’. Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite
challenging for many students.


  - Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the
schwa sound has a particular spelling:
_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is a schwa syllable, but it is identified separately
because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables
accordingly throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _tri·cycle_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness_ _help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten—Grade
3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.
