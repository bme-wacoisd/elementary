**Grade 3 | Foundational Skills 9**
#### Introduction


~~**UNIT 9 OVERVIEW**~~


This unit reviews several skills introduced in earlier units, focusing largely on the nuances in
language that can change the meaning of a text. It begins by reviewing synonyms and antonyms,
which helps students to understand not just the literal meaning of words but also the connotations
and subtle differences in meaning.


Similarly, the instruction on homophones and homographs develops accurate listening and reading
skills, as they help students recognize and understand words that may be confusing due to their
similar sounds or spellings. While homophones were taught in several previous units, Unit 9
introduces new pairs, such as _bass–base, cell–sell, scent–cent, die–dye, hair–hare,_ and _red–read._


Additionally, students review the suffix _–ful_, first taught in Unit 6, and add the prefixes _im–_ and _non–_
to their understanding of morphology. Affixes modify the meanings of base words; this knowledge is
fundamental in word formation and vocabulary expansion, allowing for more precise language use
and better comprehension of complex texts.


This unit also introduces the digraphs _gn, kn,_ and _wr_ . These digraphs are unique because they
represent sounds where the first letter is silent. Understanding these digraphs enhances phonetic
awareness, enabling students to recognize and interpret these unconventional sound patterns.
Students are provided with several words that start with these digraphs, which allows them to
practice alphabetizing words to the third letter. Building on their advanced code knowledge,
students learn when to pronounce the soft form of ‘c,’ as in _cent_, and ‘g,’ as in _gem_ .


Unit 9 reviews several spelling rules as well. Through multimodal activities, students practice forming
new words by adding suffixes, keeping or dropping the silent ‘e,’ and doubling final consonants.


~~**TRICKY SPELLINGS**~~


As new spellings are introduced, some complexity is added to the reading process. Some of the
spelling units that students have to process are ambiguous in the sense that they can stand for
more than one sound. These ambiguous spellings are called “tricky spellings.” In Unit 9, instruction
focuses on final syllables, and students will learn how to decode, encode, and syllabicate words with
these commonly used final stable syllables.


Introduction
**1**


**2**



~~**TRICKY WORDS & HIGH-FREQUENCY WORDS**~~


Tricky Words are introduced in this unit on an as-needed basis in the context of the different
selections included in the Reader. Tricky Words should be taught in the lessons before the reading
selections are assigned. When introducing Tricky Words, be sure to draw attention to the parts that
are read (and spelled) just as students would expect based on what they have learned so far, and
also point out the tricky parts of each word.


The Tricky Words taught in this unit are:


 - Lesson 1 – _Williamsburg, Virginia_


 - Lesson 3 – _Massachusetts, immediately_


 - Lesson 6 – _militia_


 - Lesson 7 – _gone_


In addition to addressing Tricky Words and tricky spellings, this program emphasizes the reading
and spelling of high-frequency words, carefully selected from word lists compiled by researchers
Edward William Dolch and Edward Fry. The selection of these words was based on their prevalence
within the unit Reader, and instruction is integrated into lessons at points where students will
naturally encounter these words within the assigned sections of the Readers. The curriculum
includes a structured approach for teaching high-frequency words, starting with the introduction of
8–12 keywords at the beginning of each unit, selected for their relevance and frequency in the unit’s
text. Words are introduced using phonetic sounding and Spelling Cards for decoding. Throughout
the unit, these words are reviewed in various contexts, including through decode/encode games and
fluency checkpoints to assess automaticity and fluency. This ensures that students engage with the
words multiple times, enhancing their reading skills and confidence.


The high-frequency words taught in this unit are:


 - Lesson 1 – _father, own_


 - Lesson 3 – _open, few_


 - Lesson 5 – _along, plant, last_


 - Lesson 7 – _only, young_


Foundational Skills 9


~~**READER: GEORGE MEETS MR. HENRY**~~


The Unit 9 Reader is historical fiction and tells the story of young George, living in Williamsburg
in 1775, who spends his days doing chores and running errands. Amidst his daily activities, he
overhears townspeople discussing the growing unrest against British rule, particularly about
taxation without representation and laws imposed by England. George encounters Patrick Henry,
who is struggling to prepare a speech to rally support for colonial independence. Inspired by
George’s simple perspective, Henry delivers his famous “Give me liberty or give me death!” speech,
which becomes a rallying cry for the American Revolution. The story highlights the impact of these
historical events on the lives of ordinary people, especially youth like George, during a critical
moment in American history.


**Note:** Each time students encounter a new section of text in the Reader, the lesson includes new
vocabulary words and/or phrases to accompany the section of text. There are lessons in which
students reread sections of the Reader, for the purpose of building fluency. These lessons do not
introduce new vocabulary or have a vocabulary chart.


~~**UNIT 9 ASSESSMENT**~~


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


Throughout this unit, formative assessments are clearly marked for monitoring individual student
performance and progress in key skills. Quick Checks for Understanding to evaluate classroom
performance as a whole are also designated in each lesson. Fluency practice takes place regularly
throughout the unit.


**Student Performance Assessment**


In Lessons 14 and 15 you will be prompted to administer a multipart end-of-unit assessment. In the
first part, you will work one-on-one with students to complete the Fluency Assessment. Students
will engage in a review activity while awaiting their turn for the assessment. The Reading and
Spelling portion of the Assessment takes place during the first twenty minutes of the second lesson.
Once students have completed the assessment, they will have time for Self-Sustained Reading.
Use time in this lesson to finish working with students who still need to complete the Fluency
Assessment in the previous lesson.


The target words in each of these assessments include the vowel sound/spellings taught in this
unit; distractors have been intentionally selected because they represent frequent sound/spelling
confusions. Student performance on these assessments is a good indicator of whether students
have mastered the new sound/spellings.

~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice Unit 9 skills can be found in the Pausing
Point section included after the last lesson. It is strongly recommended that you pause for one day and
provide targeted review for individuals or groups of students in any areas in which they had significant
gaps on the end-of-unit assessment. All students will benefit from an additional opportunity to reread
pages from the decodable student Readers. It is particularly important to make use of targeted activities
if the end-of unit assessment and/or formative assessments indicate that any students are experiencing
difficulties with specific skills taught during the unit. In the Pausing Point, activity pages are provided.
You may wish to reproduce the handwriting pages and use them for morning or seat work.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available in the program’s online materials. This
component has been designed to complement the unit. It consists of poetry, folklore, and fables.


These additional text selections provide opportunities for students to practice reading with fluency and
prosody (expression). See the Unit 1 introduction or directions in the Fluency Supplement for further
guidance.

Foundational Skills 9


- Point to the example at the top of the page and explain that the bolded words
were replaced with synonyms to create a new sentence. The new sentence
has nearly the same meaning because synonyms were used.


- Display this alternative sentence: _The plump feline devoured its delicious meal_ .


- Ask students: “Which words were replaced with synonyms in this sentence?”
_(fat, cat, ate, yummy, food)_


- Engage students in a discussion of when it might be appropriate to use more
complex language and when simpler language will do. Guide students to see
that complex sentences are not always better; simpler language can often
provide more clarity.


- Select volunteers to help model the first sentence. Ask students to identify
the synonym independently before replacing the bolded words. Replace each
bolded word with a synonym and rewrite the sentence on the lines below it.


- Remind students that a thesaurus is a tool that can help us find words that
have similar meanings, including synonyms. People often use thesauruses to
help them think of different and interesting words to improve their writing.


- Model how to use a print or online thesaurus to look for synonyms.


  - Remind students that, like a dictionary, the words in a thesaurus
are usually arranged in alphabetical order. Explain that sometimes
thesauruses also include definitions.


  - Model using the guide words in a thesaurus to locate the words _fat, cat,_
_ate, yummy,_ and _food_, explaining that words are also usually listed by their
base words in a thesaurus. As you locate each word, share the synonyms
listed and discuss whether any of them work better than the words in the
sentence: _The plump feline devoured its delicious meal._ Discuss whether
any of the synonyms don’t work in the sentence. Ask students: “Do all
synonyms for a word work exactly the same in a sentence?” _(No. They_
_don’t all have the exact same meaning.)_


- Ask students to complete the remaining sentences with a partner or independently.
Direct students to complete responses in cursive, leaving space between words.
Write the following three sentences on the board in cursive:


  - It was a chilly day in the small town.


  - The calm child sat silently in the waiting room.


  - The rich man was very considerate.


  - The skinny tigers seemed to be hungry and in need of a shelter.

words in isolation first and go over the correct pronunciation of each word.


**aroma, n.,** an odor or smell arising from spices, cooking, etc., especially a
pleasant smell

Example: My neighbors were grilling hamburgers and the aroma smelled
delicious.


**colony, n.,** a new land or settlement connected to a parent country

Example: The colony was growing in size as more people decided they
wanted to live there.


**errands, n.,** short trips taken to collect or accomplish something

             - Conduct a brief discussion about the different words and phrases in the
chart, including the meaning of the saying “don’t go lollygagging _.”_ For
example, show the words and ask students what prior knowledge they may
have about these words and where they might have seen them. Additionally,
have students decode any unfamiliar words and discuss the correct
pronunciation of each. The multiple meanings of the word _heated_ will be
explored in depth during the reading of the story.


             - Model how to use the Glossary in the Reader to discover the pronunciation
and definition of words in bold. Review the definition together and ask
students to share their understanding of the word. Call on a few students to
share their thinking.


              - Explain to students that _George Meets Mr. Henry_ contains many high-frequency
words. They will come across these common words often as they read, in both
the Reader and in many different texts. Learning to recognize these words and
how to spell them will improve their overall reading and writing fluency.


              - Display this lesson’s high-frequency word: _father_ and _own_


             - Ask students: “Based on what you already know about the Reader, why do
you think we might come across the words _father_ often as we read _George_
_Meets Mr. Henry_ ? _(George is a man, so he could be a father. Mr. Henry could_
_also be a father.)_


             - Focus on the word _father_ . Underline the r-controlled syllable /er/. In Unit 5,
we discussed different r-controlled syllables. Remind students that the letter
‘r’ is a spelling for a consonant sound, but the sound /r/ can mingle with
certain vowel sounds to create unique vowel sounds like /er/.


             - Focus on the word _own_ . Write it on the board, and have students turn and
talk about what they notice in the word _own_ . ( _It has an ‘ow’ at the beginning,_
_but unlike the diphthong rule with /ou/ sound, it does not make that sound. It_
_makes the /oe/ sound._ )

Foundational Skills 9


- Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves saying it slowly and tapping your
fingers at each sound: /oe/ /n/


- Remind students that most English words play by the rules, meaning they
are pronounced and spelled as we would expect. There are a few words that
do not play by the rules, including some very common and important ones.
Words that do not play by the rules (i.e., words not pronounced and spelled
as expected) are called “Tricky Words.”


- Display Tricky Words, read each word, and use it aloud in a sentence:


  - _Williamsburg_


  - _Virginia_


- Point out which parts of each word are not regular and will either be taught
later or simply must be remembered.


  - Tricky Word: _Williamsburg_ (Explain that the letters ‘ia’ are pronounced
/y/, /u/.)


  - Tricky Word: _Virginia_ (Explain that the letters ‘ia’ are pronounced /y/, /u/.)


- Explain that this text is historical fiction, which means that some events in
the story are based on actual events from history and some parts are made
up from the author’s imagination. Point out the Author’s Note at the end of
the Reader. Explain that this is the part of the text that clarifies which parts of
the story are true and which parts are fictional.


- Model fluent reading for a sentence or two, using appropriate rate,
expression, and pausing for punctuation. Then, assign students to read
pages 1–10 aloud, either with a partner or independently.


- Choose strategic prompts to check for comprehension as well as to check
for their ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or
multiple-meaning words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant
questions to clarify any information from the Reader or strategic prompts.
Example prompts include:


1. **Literal.** What do you know about the setting of this text? _(It takes place_
_in a Virginia colony in Williamsburg.)_


2. **Literal.** What is a synonym for the word aroma as used on page 2? _(e.g._
_odor, scent, smell, fragrance, etc.)_


3. **Inferential.** What can the reader infer about what time of year it is in the
story? _(It is likely getting close to springtime, as George has noticed that_
_the days are getting warmer, but the mornings are still chilly)._

**Beginning**
In pairs, have students look
at the images in the Reader
of _George Meets Mr. Henry_
and discussing what they
see using the sentence
stems: “I notice that…” or
“In this picture, I see…” Ask
simple questions: Who is in
the story? Where does the
story take place?


**Intermediate**
Have students preview the
Reader images in _George_
_Meets Mr. Henry_ and create
a bank of words from the
story. Lead students in a
discussion: Who will you
meet in the story? Where
will the story take place?
Provide sentence frames
such as The story will take
place ______.


**Advanced/Advanced High**

Have students preview the
text. Then have students
independently write
responses to “Who will
you meet in the story?
Where will the story take
place?” and then share
with a partner why they
think those characters and
setting will be in the story.

deal of work to do? _(His mother tells him to bring a meal to his father, stay_
_focused on his errands, he has wood to chop and weeds to pull, etc.)_


5. **Inferential.** The story explains that Virginia in 1775 is a fascinating place
because people are discussing whether the colonies can survive without
the support of England. Some colonists feel very patriotic and would like to
form their own country. How do you know that George is very interested in
these discussions? _(His mother tells him not to waste time listening to the_
_men chatter, George notices they are starting to argue more, etc.)_


- Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses
using the following sentence stems:


  - The setting is...


  - A synonym for the word aroma is...


  - The time of the year is most likely...


  - George has the following work to do...


  - George shows that he’s interested in these discussions because he...


- Students can expand on their responses by asking these follow-up questions:


  - What information in the text helped you answer the question?


  - Where did you find information in the text to support your answer?


  - What clues in the text helped you know the answer to that question?


- As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record and provide immediate and

  - generous–selfish


  - brave–timid


  - vertical–horizontal


  - deep–shallow


- If time allows, have students continue working with a partner. One partner
will say a word for example: _short_ . The other partner will think of an antonym
for their partners word. ( _tall_ )


- Invite students take turns acting out the meaning of each word.


- If time allows, provide students with pairs such as _smell_ - _taste_ or _jump_ - _run_ .
Ask if these are antonym pairs and support them in understanding that
antonyms have to have directly opposite meanings. In these examples, the
words are somewhat related but have different meanings. This is different
from having opposite meanings.


- Ask students to turn to Activity Page 2.1.


- Read the directions to the students: Choose a word or words in the sentence
to replace with an antonym. Rewrite the sentence for clarity and detail
to show a different meaning. Write in cursive and use correct grammar
structure and spacing.


- Model the example sentence for the class in cursive on the board:


  - George woke up in the early morning darkness.


  - George slept in until the early afternoon sunlight woke him up.


- Ask: “How does the sentence change when we replace words with
antonyms?” _(It changes the time of day of the scene, and the sentence now_
_makes sense.)_

birthday party continued to gnaw at her.


- Conduct a brief discussion about the different words and phrases in the
chart, including the meaning of the saying “continued to gnaw.” For example,
show the words and ask students what prior knowledge they may have about
these words and where they might have seen them.


- Model how to use the Glossary in the Reader to discover the pronunciation
and definition of words in bold. Review the definition together and ask
students to share their understanding of the word. Call on a few students to
share their thoughts.


- Explain that _George Meets Mr. Henry_ contains many high-frequency words.
They will come across these common words often as they read, in both the
Reader and in many different texts. Learning to recognize these words and
how to spell them will improve their overall reading and writing fluency.

- Remind students that most English words play by the rules, meaning they
are pronounced and spelled as we would expect. There are a few words that
do not play by the rules, including some very common and important ones.
Words that do not play by the rules (i.e., words not pronounced and spelled
as expected) are called “Tricky Words.”


- Display Tricky Words, read each word, and use it aloud in a sentence:


  - _Massachusetts_


  - _immediately_


- Point out which parts of each word are not regular and will either be taught
later or simply must be remembered.


  - Tricky Word: _Massachusetts_ (Explain that the letter ‘u’ is pronounced /oo/.)


  - Tricky Word: _immediately_ (Explain that the letter ‘a’ is pronounced /u/.)


- Guide the class in reading Chapter 2. Model fluent reading for a sentence
or two, using appropriate rate expression and pausing for punctuation.
Then, assign students to read pages 11–22 aloud, either with a partner or
independently.

- Choose strategic prompts to check for comprehension as well as to check
for students’ ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar
or multiple-meaning words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant
questions to clarify any information from the Reader or strategic prompts.
Example prompts include:


1. **Literal:** What is George wondering about as he walks to town? _(He talks_
_about longing to know what the townspeople are talking about and what is_
_being discussed at the convention.)_


2. **Inferential:** What does the word _impending_ mean in the phrase “that
impending meeting”? What text clues and word knowledge help you
figure this out? _(It means it is going to happen. George talks about the_
_meeting being planned for later that month.)_


3. **Inferential:** What does the word _nonsense_ mean in the phrase “it was
nonsense”? What text clues and word knowledge help you figure this
out? _(It is foolish; the colonists sound irritated at what the English rule_
_is doing. The word nonsense does have a prefix at the beginning_ non– _._
_Remember that_ non– _means not. So, something that is nonsense means it_
_does not make sense.)_


4. **Literal:** How does George feel when he gets to make decisions
within his family? _(George feels like his parents trust him, and this makes_
_him work hard, he feels proud, he feels grateful for his parents’ trust.)_


- Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses
using the following sentence stems:


  - George is wondering about...


  - Impending means...


  - Nonsense means...


  - George feels ____ when he gets to make decisions within his family.


- Students can expand on their responses by asking these follow-up questions:


  - What information in the text helped you answer the question?


  - Where did you find information in the text to support your answer?


  - What clues in the text helped you know the answer to that question?


- As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record and provide immediate and
corrective feedback, such as, “Make sure to sound out syllables in words. Use
context clues to help read unfamiliar words. Reread the whole sentence to
help understand the meaning of the text.”

Explain that suffixes are
added to the back of a base
word to create a new word
with a different meaning.
All base words can stand
alone, but sometimes the
spelling of the base word
is altered slightly when
a suffix is added. Have
students try to break up the
word beautiful into a base
word and suffix. The word
_beautiful_ separated is _beauty_

base word to add the suffix,
you have to drop the _y_ and
change to an _i_ before adding
_–ful_ to make beautiful.

) **Digital Component 5.1**


  - Tell students that last lesson we learned about the suffix – _ful_ . Turn to a
partner, and discuss how the meaning of the word _power_ is changed when
you add the suffix – _ful_ . ( _Power is a thing [a noun], but the new word means_
_“full of power.” Now, it is a describing word [an adjective]._ )


  - Teach the strategy for determining the meaning of unfamiliar words using
context. Ask students to turn and talk with a partner: “How do you think this
strategy can help you figure out the meaning of a word you don’t know?


  - Model the strategy for students using the following sentences: “His two
brothers ate their breakfast of steaming cornmeal mush and dried apples from
the root cellar. George smiled gratefully at his mother as she filled his bowl.”


  - Identify the unknown word. _(gratefully)_


  - Stop and reread the sentence, paying close attention to the words around the
unknown word.


  - Identify the context clues that his brothers were already eating, he was very
hungry, his mother filled his bowl.


  - Make an educated guess about what _gratefully_ might mean. _(It might mean_
_thankfully because you would be thankful if someone gave you food when you’re_
_hungry. He may have been thankful that his mother was serving the food for him.)_


  - Replace the word _gratefully_ with your guess to check the meaning. Does it

Foundational Skills 9


- Focus on the word _along_ . Write it on the board, read it to the students, and
have the students repeat the word _along_ . Spell it as a class, and clap out the
syllables in the word. Have students turn and talk about what else they notice
in the word _along_ . ( _It has an ‘a’ at the beginning, but the ‘a’ makes a /u/ sound._
_It is a two-syllable word. The second word is a real word on its own, long._ )


- Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves saying it slowly and tapping your
fingers at each sound: /u/ /l/ /o/ /ng/. For additional support, display the
Spelling Cards for each sound.


- Next, focus on the word _plant_ . Write it on the board, read it to the students,
and have the students repeat the word _plant_ . Spell it as a class, and clap
out the syllables in the word. Have students turn and talk about what else
they notice in the word _plant_ . ( _It has an ‘pl’ blend at the beginning. It is a one_
_syllable word. It has the word ‘an’ in the word_ plant _._ )


- Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask

- Focus on the word _last_ . Write it on the board, read it to the students, and have
the students repeat the word _last_ . Spell it as a class, and clap out the syllables
in the word. Have students turn and talk about what else they notice in the
word last. (It has an ‘st’ blend at the end of the word. It is a one syllable word.)


- Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask
students to repeat the word themselves saying it slowly and tapping your
fingers at each sound: /l/ /a/ /s/ /t/.


- In the past few units students have learned about adding suffixes to the end
of words. Have students add suffixes to the end of _last_ ( _lastly_, _lasted_, _lasting_ .)


- Model fluent reading for a sentence or two, using appropriate rate,
expression, and pausing for punctuation. Then, assign students to read
pages 23–34 aloud, either with a partner or independently.


- Choose strategic prompts to check for comprehension as well as to check
for their ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar or
multiple-meaning words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant
questions to clarify any information from the Reader or strategic prompts.
Example prompts include:


1. **Inferential:** Using your knowledge of prefixes and context clues, what might
_midday_ mean in the phrase, “He hoped to get there before it got crowded for
the midday meal”? _(Look closely at the statement and the word midday. The_

understand the sentence and fill in the correct homophone on the line.


 - Each sentence will have a set of homophones to fill in the blank. Read the
sentences. Fill in the sentence with the correct homophone. Use context
clues to help decide which homophones fit in the sentence best.


 - Look at the first sentence as a group, and read it with the blank. There are
three homophone choices for the blank _(their/there/they’re)._


 - Have students look at those three words _(their/there/they’re)_ and define
what each one means as a group. _Their_ is a possessive pronoun that means
“belonging to them.” _There_ is a word used to describe a location. _They’re_ is a
contraction that stands for “they are.” After looking at all of these definitions,
have students look back at the sentence and decide which form of this
homophone fits best.


 - Direct students to number 5. Tell students they need to write a response to
the question, ensuring they use text evidence found in the story to support
their answer.


 - Remind students to write neatly in cursive.


 - Circulate and monitor to check for correct letter formation in cursive. Provide

Writing


**Vocabulary**


**Beginning**
To help students complete
Activity 8.1, give students
a starting point for
writing sentences with
homographs by prompting
students to start each
sentence with a subject +
verb. Remind students to
include some context in
each sentence so that the
meaning of the homograph
is clear. Allow students
to work with a partner to
create their sentences and
then practice reading their
sentences aloud.


**Intermediate**
Remind students to
include some context in
each sentence so that the
meaning of the homograph
is clear. Adding more context
clues to help describe
the homograph helps the
reader to know what the
meaning of the homograph
is. Have students trade with
a partner and read their
partner’s sentences aloud.


**Advanced/ Advanced High**
On the back of the paper,
think of a homograph that
has not been used yet. Write
two or more sentences
on the back using that
homograph. Read the
sentences to a partner.

  - I liked it when you speed up your rate during action scenes.


  - You corrected yourself when you made an error.


  - The best part of your reading was when you read like George was talking
to Patrick Henry.


- Choose strategic pausing points to check for comprehension as well as to
check for their ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar
or multiple-meaning words. Example prompts include:


1. **Literal:** What are some things that are worrying the colonists in
Williamsburg at this point in the text? _(food supply and the quartering)_


2. **Inferential:** In the text, there are some homographs that we have
highlighted. Look at the homograph _break_ . This word has multiple meanings.
What is the meaning in this text? What are some of the other meanings of
the word break? If needed, use a dictionary for other definitions of break.
_(Taking a pause, Patrick Henry talks about wanting to stop practicing for a_
_moment to help him.)_


3. **Inferential:** What can the reader infer about the colonies based on this
sentence? “George knew that Britain and its king relied on the colonies to
grow bountiful crops and produce the goods England needed. ” _(The colonies_
_have fertile soil and plenty of land that is able to produce a lot of crops.)_


4. **Inferential:** What words and phrases in the following sentences help the
reader understand the meaning of sacrifices? I need to convince some
very skeptical people that we are at a moment in our history of great
importance. They may disagree with me, but they must understand that
our liberty is at stake. _(convince, disagree with me, must understand.)_


- Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses using
the following sentence stems:


  - The colonists are worrying about...


  - The meaning of break in the text is... Other meanings of break are...


  - The reader can infer...


  - The words ____ help me understand the meaning of sacrifices.


- As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record and provide immediate and
corrective feedback, such as, “Make sure to sound out syllables in words. Use
context clues to help read unfamiliar words. Reread the whole sentence to
help understand the meaning of the text.”

read aloud the other paragraphs to the class while their peers follow along.


 - Choose strategic pausing points to check for comprehension as well as to
check for their ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar
or multiple-meaning words. Have students listen actively and ask relevant
questions to clarify any information from the Reader or strategic prompts.
Example prompts include:


1. **Inferential:** What does it mean when it says that “the cost of freedom
might be great”? _(What they are going to have to do for freedom may be_
_difficult and not end well.)_


2. **Inferential:** What does the word regretting mean? What in the text
helps you figure this out? _(Feeling bad about something; in the story, it_
_says George didn’t regret interrupting because they were so impactful,_
_meaning he didn’t feel bad about it.)_


3. **Evaluative:** Why do you think Patrick Henry’s famous phrase “Give me
liberty or give me death” is still important today? _(Answers may vary, but_
_should include ideas about the importance of freedom.)_


 - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses using
the following sentence stems:


   - “The cost of freedom might be great” means...


   - The word regretting means _____. I know this because of the context clues...


   - “Give me libery or give me death” is still important today because...

~~**ELPS 4.G; ELPS 1.B**~~



~~**PARTNER READ GEORGE MEETS MR. HENRY (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Pair students with intentional reading partners.


 - Tell students that today’s partner reading of Chapter 5 and the Author’s
Note will be focused on fluency, which is rate (appropriate pace), accuracy
(reading words correctly), and prosody (using phrasing and intonation to
convey meaning).


 - Model fluent reading for a paragraph, emphasizing proper pacing, expression,
and intonation. Demonstrate how to smoothly navigate through the text,
maintaining a natural flow that enhances comprehension. Pay particular
attention to phrasing and grouping words for meaningful expression.


1. Adjust your pitch to emphasize important words or ideas. This helps
convey the meaning and emotion in the text.


2. Read at a natural pace, not too fast or too slow. Vary your speed based
on the content, slowing down for important details or speeding up for
less crucial information.


3. Use pauses to signal transitions between ideas or paragraphs. Pauses
allow students to process information and understand the structure of
the text.


 - Direct students to the paragraph in the Author’s Note beginning with
“Historians, people who . . .” and ending with “. . . give me death!”


 - Ask: How would you describe the tone that I used to read this text? _(showing_
_strong feeling)_


 - Ask: What in the text hints at the tone the narrator might use in this scene?
Give specific examples. _(The exclamation point in the sentence “Give me_
_liberty or give me death!” gives us a clue.)_


 - Today, students will follow these Partner Reading routines.


1. Open Reader.


2. Partner up.


3. Take turns reading paragraphs.


4. After reading, provide feedback to your partner about emphasizing
proper pace, expression, and intonation. Use the stems provided such as,
“I liked it when you read with feeling and expression.”


 - Have students repeat these steps back to you and then have them start the
Partner Reading routine.


 - Direct students to alternate reading sentences until the end of the section. If
time allows, ask students to partner read this section again.


 - Ask the students to finish reading the passage with a partner.



Foundational Skills 9

 - As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual
reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record and provide immediate and
corrective feedback.


 - Remind students to practice all aspects of fluency as their partner reads.
They should give feedback to their partners based on the sentence stems
from Partner Reading Feedback.


 - Direct students to alternate reading paragraphs through Chapter 5 and the
Author’s Note.


 - After several minutes, have students evaluate each other’s reading by giving
each other positive feedback. Point out the sentence stems on Partner
Reading Feedback. Listen for effective student feedback. For example:

   - You did a great job when you paid attention to the punctuation marks.

   - I like how you corrected yourself when you made an error.

   - You corrected yourself when you said library instead of liberty.

   - The best part of your reading was when you said, “Give me liberty or give
me death!” with enthusiasm.


 - Identify trends in student partner reading. Provide the class batch feedback
to support future partner reading.


Check for Understanding


As students read, check to see that partners can follow along in the text with a

marker or finger. Note students who may still need practice with rate, accuracy, or

prosody.


~~**WRAP UP (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Direct students to search for and list words in Chapter 1 of the Reader that
contain either the soft ‘c’ or the soft ‘g’ pattern.


 - Display the words, and ask them to share any that they may have missed:
_George, Virginia, noticed, vegetable, circled, cellar, large, fascinating, place_ .


 - Have students open to Activity Page 10.2.


 - Direct them to sort and write the words in the correct column. Ask them to
underline the patterns for soft ‘c’ and soft ‘g.’

- Write the word _scrubbing_ on the board in cursive. Model proper letter
formations. Invite students to write words in cursive in the air with their index
finger.


- Ask: What is the base word in the word _scrubbing_ ? _(scrub)_ What is the suffix?
( _–ing)_


- Underline the suffix _-ing_ in the word _scrubbing_ .


- Ask: How many syllables are in the word _scrub_ ? _(one)_ Does it have a short or
long vowel? _(short)_


- Reiterate that because _scrub_ is a one-syllable word that has a short vowel
sound and ends in a single consonant, we double the ‘b’ before adding the
_–ing_ . _Scrub_ turns to _scrubbing_ . Circle the double ‘b’ in _scrubbing_ .


- Write _scrubbing_ without the double consonant on the board. _(scrubbing)_


- Ask: How would we pronounce this word differently if we hadn’t doubled the
consonant? _(It would have the long ‘u’ sound /oo/.)_


- Guide students through the same process but a different suffix at the end
of _–ed_ .


- Call on a student to quickly write the word _hummed_ on the board in cursive.

Invite the rest of the students to write words in cursive in the air with their
index finger.


- Ask: What is the base word in the word _hummed_ ? _(hum)_ What is the
suffix _–ed_ ?


- Underline the suffix – _ed_ in the word _hummed_ .


- Ask: How many syllables are in the word _hum_ ? _(one)_ Does it have a short or
long vowel? _(short)_


- Reiterate that because _hum_ is a one-syllable word that has a short vowel
sound and ends in a single consonant, we double the ‘m’ before adding the
_–ed_ . _Hum_ turns to _hummed_ . Circle the double ‘m’ in _hummed_ .

  - Check students’ lists and spelling as a class.


~~**PRACTICE WITH BASE WORD + SUFFIX (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students to open to Activity Page 12.2.


  - Point to the first word, _chop_ . With students, check to see that the word has a
short vowel and ends in a single consonant.


  - Point to the last column in the first row, and note that when _–ing_ is added, the
final consonant is doubled. Circle the double ‘p.’


  - Direct students to complete the rest of Activity Page 12.2 independently.

Remind them to check each base word for a short vowel sound and a single
consonant at the end before adding the suffix.


  - Before collecting Activity Page 12.2, ask students to identify the two base
words that did not follow the rule for doubling the consonant ( _bump_ and _yell_ ).
Discuss what makes these two base words different. _(They both end in two_
_consonants rather than a single consonant.)_


  - Read the directions of the next section: Write a paragraph using new words
you created in the box above. Write in cursive with correct grammar structure

Encourage students
needing additional
support to say the new
words quietly and/or work
with a partner.

Provide a personal size

copy of the alphabet
for students needing
additional support with

alphabetizing.




 - Remind students that when a word ends in silent ‘e’ and you add a vowel
suffix like _–ed_, _–er_, and _–ing_, you drop the ‘e.’


 - Using the large index card with _–ing_ written on it, cover up the ‘e’ in _please_,
making the word _pleasing_ . Write this word on the board.


 - Do this with the _–ed_ side of the card and write _pleased_ on the board.


 - Remind students that _please_ is the base word and _–ing_ and _–ed_ are vowel suffixes.


 - Repeat with the word _make_ . Note that although _making_ is a word, _maked_ is not.


~~**PRACTICE WITH DROPPING THE ‘E’ (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask students to open to Activity Page 13.1.


 - Tell students that they will be adding the suffixes _–ing_ and _–ed_ to base words
to make new words.


 - Ask students to use their finger to cover the ‘e’ on the base word _please_ and
think of how to create a new word _pleasing_ . Have students write that word in
the _–ing_ column. (Optional: Have students use premade craft sticks, with – _ed_
written on one side and – _ing_ on the other, instead of their finger to cover the _e_ .)


 - Draw students’ attention to the example in the second row, _make_ . Remind
students that adding the suffix _–ed_ to this base word did not create a real
word. Note the ‘X’ in the column under _–ed_ .


 - They should write the new words in the correct columns. If a new word is not
a real word, students should place an ‘X’ in that space.


 - Direct them to write the three words provided in alphabetical order at the
bottom of the activity page. Review alphabetizing to the third letter as needed.


 - Remind students to complete all responses in cursive. Offer feedback such as


   - “Check that your loops and tails are formed smoothly and connect to the
next letter.”


   - “You’re doing well with your cursive! Pay attention to the slant of your
letters. Try to keep them all at the same angle.”

Activity Page 13.1: Drop the ‘e’


Collect Activity Page 13.1, and assess students’ ability to correctly spell the new words by

dropping the ‘e’ before adding the suffix. Check to see that students can alphabetize words

to the third letter. Use the Grade 3 Foundational Skills Record to track students’ proficiency

in the standards assigned to this assessment.


~~**REVIEW SUFFIX SPELLING: CHANGE ‘Y’ TO ‘I’ (3 MIN.)**~~


  - Write the word _strawberry_ on the board. Ask students to turn to a partner to
share how to turn this into the word _strawberries_ .


  - Remind students that when a word ends with a consonant and ‘y,’ we change

the ‘y’ to ‘i’ before adding a suffix. Reiterate that this rule does not apply to
the suffix _–ing_ because it would double the ‘i.’


  - Write the word colony on the board in cursive. Underline the ‘n’ before the ‘y.’


  - Ask: Colony is our base word. Is there a consonant or a vowel before the final
‘y’? Will we need to change the ‘y’ to an ‘i’ before we add a suffix? _(‘n’ is a_
_consonant, so we will need to change the ‘y’ to an ‘i’ before adding a suffix.)_


  - Write the word _colonies_ on the board.


~~**PRACTICE WITH BOARD SORT (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students to open to Activity Page 13.2.


  - Read the directions to the students: Sort the base words into the correct
columns: _pretty_, _holiday_, _delivery_, _activity_, _replay_ .


  - Model with the examples: _strawberry_, _highway_ .


  - Direct students to complete the rest of the table independently.


  - After the words are sorted, ask students to choose a word from the table,
apply the spelling rule, and write a sentence using the word.


  - Remind students to complete all responses in cursive. Provide feedback such
as “Check the spacing between your words. Make sure there’s enough room
between each word to maintain readability.”


  - If time, pass out Words Ending in ‘y’ (TR 13.2) and have students add more
words to their table.



Challenge


Pass out Base Word and
Suffix Cards (TR 13.1) and
ask students to sort the
cards and rewrite on paper

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today, the students will begin the multi-part Assessment. In the first part,
you will work one-on-one with students to complete the Fluency Assessment.
Students will engage in a review activity while awaiting their turn for the
assessment. Remind students to use a whisper voice, since testing will be
taking place concurrently with other activities.


You will most likely need more than one day to test each student; you may
plan on using time during the following lesson to complete the Fluency
Assessment.


The second part of the assessment takes place in the next lesson. It is a
reading and spelling exercise targeting each of the skills taught in Unit 9.


**Foundational Skills**

 - Optional: Prepare student pairings to play Swim to the Finish.


 - Optional: Gather copies of the Swim to the Finish Game Board (one for each
student pair). These game boards were also used in Lesson 9.


 - Optional: Make one set of Swim to the Finish Word Cards for each pair.


**Reading**

 - Gather books of varying complexity for students to choose from during SelfSustained Reading time.


 - Make copies for students of the Self-Sustained Reading Tracker (TR 14.2).
Students will record their reading progress as they read independently.


 - Consider both quantitative and qualitative factors when selecting book
options. Offer a variety of genres. Encourage students to explore any books
that interest them regardless of their reading level.


**Universal Access**

 - Differentiate the degree of difficulty by preparing different sets of word cards
based on student mastery of unit skills.


 - Have students play Swim to the Finish Game (TR 9.1-TR 9.3) with partners as
a review before the assessment.

  - Use a previously established protocol for selecting recreational reading
materials.


  - Allow students to find comfortable places around the classroom to read.


  - Remind students of the expectations for quiet independent reading and the
importance of building reading stamina.


  - Provide suggestions for how students can maintain focus while reading,
such as breaking the text into chunks and sketching a quick picture to
demonstrate the key parts of each text chunk.


  - Students will continue reading as you pull individual students for fluency testing.


  - Students should record their reading progress on their own copy of the SelfSustained Reading Tracker (TR 14.2).

Check for Understanding


Encourage students to use a journal to keep track of the books they are reading and

the page numbers they are on. Students may want to also record important ideas

and connections to the story as they read.


~~**PLAY SWIM TO THE FINISH (OPTIONAL)**~~


 - Move students into pairs. Remind students to speak politely to their partner
and take turns while playing the game.


 - Give each pair a copy of the Swim to the Finish Game Board (TR 9.1), Swim to
the Finish Word Cards (TR 9.2), and Swim to the Finish Directions (TR 9.3).


 - Have each student write their name or initials at the top of a column, or swim
lane.


 - Explain the game:


 - Place cards face down in a pile. Students take turns drawing a card and
reading the word on the card.


 - When students read their words correctly, they should write a check mark in
the next square of their swim lane.


 - The first one to the finish line wins! If both students read all of their words
correctly, it will be a tie swim meet.


 - Have students play one full round of the game. If time allows, they can shuffle
the cards and play again, marking spaces with an ‘X’ or other marking of their
choice. You may also choose to use laminated boards and dry erase markers.

**Primary Focus:** Students will read aloud with appropriate accuracy, rate, and

~~**FLUENCY ASSESSMENT (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Explain that students will be called individually to take their Fluency
Assessment. While they are waiting their turn, they will play a game to review
the unit skills. Students should use whisper voices because their peers will be
concurrently testing as they play the review game.


  - You will work individually with each student and take a running record of the
student’s oral reading of a text. For this assessment, you will take a simple,
easily calculated measure of the student’s fluency by seeing how long it takes
the student to read the text. Allow each student three minutes to read the
text. Students with proficient fluency should be able to complete the text in
this amount of time. Instruct students to work coherently and complete the
comprehension questions after reading the text.


  - Have one student at a time come to a quiet assessment area to read “Sweet
Treats” with you.


  - Ask the student for Activity Page 14.1 (Fluency Assessment) and Activity
Page 14.2 (Fluency Assessment Questions).


  - Tell the student that you are going to ask them to read the text aloud.


  - Explain that you are going to use a watch to see how long it takes them to
read the text. Tell the student that this is not a race; they should read at their
regular pace and not rush.


  - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the title. If you are
using a watch, write the exact start time in minutes and seconds on your
record page.


  - If you are using a stopwatch, you do not need to write down the start time
since the stopwatch will calculate elapsed time.


  - As the student reads the text, make a running record on the copy with the
student’s name using the following guidelines:


**TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text.



Activity Page 14.1



Lesson 14 Fluency Assessment
**121**


Activity Page 14.2




 - When the student finishes reading the text, write the exact finish time in
minutes and seconds on your record sheet. Ask students to complete the
questions on Activity Page 14.2.


 - Alternatively, if you are using a stopwatch, simply write down the elapsed
time in minutes and seconds.


 - If the student reads very slowly, you may need to stop the reading before the
student gets to the end of the text. (Three minutes should be enough time to
get a measurement.) If the student does not read to the end, draw a vertical
line on the record sheet to indicate how far the student read. Also, write down
either the finish time or the elapsed time.


 - Repeat this process for additional students.


Activity Page 14.2: Fluency Assessment


If the reading was fairly accurate (< 10 uncorrected errors), you can get a rough (and

easy) estimate of a student’s W.C.P.M. score simply by noting the time and looking at

the chart on the Unit 9 W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


To calculate a student’s exact W.C.P.M. score, follow the described steps:


   - First, complete the Words section of the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet (TR 14.1).


   - Count Words Read. This is the total number of words that the student read or

attempted to read, up to the point where they stopped. It includes words that

the student read correctly as well as words that the student read incorrectly or

skipped over. If the student attempted to read the whole text, including the title,

use 351 words as your total. If the student did not finish the text, you will need

to count the number of words that the student actually attempted to read. Write

the count for Words Read in the matching box on the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


Foundational Skills 9



**122**


    - Count the uncorrected mistakes noted in your running record. This includes

words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and words that you had to

supply. Write the total in the box labeled Uncorrected Mistakes. (A mistake that

is corrected by the student is not counted as a mistake; the student is penalized

for the time they lost making the correction, but not for the initial mistake.)


    - Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get Words Correct.


    - Next, complete the Time section of the activity page.


    - Calculate elapsed time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a stopwatch, this

should already be done for you. Skip to the next step.) If you used a watch and

recorded start and stop times, you will need to subtract the Start Time from the

Finish Time to calculate the Elapsed Time. Subtract seconds from seconds then

minutes from minutes. Calculate Time in Seconds. Multiply the number of minutes

by 60 to convert minutes to seconds, and then add the number of seconds.


    - Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then, multiply by 60 to get Words

Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.).


As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider:


    - It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M. scores.

However, a major goal for Grade 3 students is to read with sufficient fluency

to ensure comprehension and independent reading of school assignments in

subsequent grades. Exact fluency targets vary from state to state; the national mean

calculated by Hasbrouck and Tindal in 2017 for Spring of Grade 3 is 112 W.C.P.M.


    - A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared with the score of other students

in the classroom (or grade level) and also with the national fluency norms for

Spring of Grade 3 obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal. Students whose scores

are below the 25th percentile (91 W.C.P.M.) are experiencing serious problems in

reading fluently.


Compare the student’s W.C.P.M. score to national norms for Spring of Grade 3

(Hasbrouck and Tindal, 2017):

|Reading Time for this Text|W.C.P.M.|National Percentiles for<br>Spring, Grade 3|
|---|---|---|
|2:35<br>3:05<br>4:05<br>5:55<br>8:00|166<br>139<br>112<br>91<br>63|90th<br>75th<br>50th<br>25th<br>10th|



After you have entered each student’s scores on the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet,

record them on the Grade 3 End-of-Year Summary for each student.

~~**LESSON AT A GLANCE**~~


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**

             - Today, you will complete the multipart Unit 9 Assessment. The Reading and
Spelling portion of the Assessment takes place during the first 20 minutes
of this lesson. Once students have completed the assessment, they will have
time for Self-Sustained Reading. Use time in this lesson to finish working with
students who did not complete the Fluency Assessment in the previous lesson.


**Foundational Skills**

             - Provide colored pencils for students to use when checking and correcting
their spelling on Activity Page 15.2.


**Reading**

             - Consider preparing games used in previous lessons in this unit for review to
be available as an optional activity after assessments.


             - Gather books of varying complexity for students to choose from during SelfSustained Reading time. Students should continue listing out books read on
the Self-Sustained Reading Tracker (TR 14.2)


**Universal Access**

             - Provide audiobooks or books in students’ home languages as options for
Self-Sustained Reading. Foundational Skills 9

**Grade 3 | Unit 9**
#### Pausing Point


This is the end of Unit 9. Analyze the results from the Unit 9 Assessments
in the two previous lessons and determine which skills in the unit students
need to review. Pause here and spend 1 day providing targeted acceleration
in the specific areas of weakness. This is also a good time to expand the
abilities of students who can go further and need a challenge. Students can
do any combination of the exercises listed below in any order. The exercises
are listed by unit objectives. You may find that different students need extra
practice with different objectives. It can be helpful to have students focus on
specific exercises in small groups.

~~**MORE HELP WITH SYNONYMS AND ANTONYMS**~~


**Play Antonym Match Puzzles**

  - Distribute the Antonym Match Puzzle Pieces, making sure that each piece
distributed has a match.


  - Ask students to move about the room and find the person who has an
antonym for their word.


  - Once all pairs have been created, ask each pair to read their antonyms aloud.


  - Optional: Redistribute the puzzle pieces and repeat. For this round, time
students to see how long it takes them, then redistribute the puzzle pieces
and challenge them to beat their time.


~~**MORE HELP WITH HOMOPHONES AND HOMOGRAPHS**~~


**Play Homophone Toss**

  - Display the Homophone Cards on the board or an open wall.


  - Split the class into two teams.


  - Students will take turns tossing the ball at the Homophone Cards.


  - When the ball hits a card, the student should use that word correctly in a
sentence. If they are successful, they get a point for their team.


  - Alternate teams until all students have had a turn.


  - The team with the most points at the end wins the game!


~~**MORE HELP WITH AFFIXES**~~


**Play Break and Make**

  - Display a list of the highlighted words from above and others that are in the
rest of Chapter 3 of the Reader: _hoping, raced, becoming, served, realized,_
_taking, excited, leaving, preparing, believed, silenced, ruling._


  - Shuffle the Base Word and Suffix Cards and distribute one to each student.
Ask students with a base word card to find a student with a suffix card that
creates the word from the text. For example, the student with the card that
says hope should find someone with an _–ing_ suffix card, and the student with
the card that says race should find someone with an ed suffix card.


  - Once all students have paired up, each pair should stand up, put their cards
together (covering the ‘e’), and display the new word.


Pausing Point
**133**


 - Check to see that students can identify words following the pattern in text.
Assess students’ ability to combine the base word with the suffix to create a
new word that has dropped the ‘e.’


~~**MORE HELP WITH MULTISYLLABIC WORDS**~~


**Play Swim to the Finish**

 - Move students into pairs.


 - Give each pair a copy of the Swim to the Finish Game Board and a set of
Swim to the Finish Word Cards.


 - Have each student write their name or initials at the top of a column, or swim
lane.


 - Explain the game:


   - Place cards face down in a pile. Students take turns drawing a card and
reading the word on the card.


   - When students read their words correctly, they should write a check
mark in the next square of their swim lane.


   - The first one to the finish line wins! If both students read all of their
words correctly, it will be a tie swim meet.


 - Have students play one full round of the game. If time allows, they can shuffle
the cards and play again, marking spaces with an ‘X’ or other marking of their
choice. You may also choose to use laminated boards and dry erase markers.

###### Grade 3 Foundational Skills Record

Teacher Instructions: Create one copy of the Foundational Skills Record per student. Use assessments
within the unit to track the student’s progress toward mastery of each standard. Use the rating system
to indicate the level of teacher support required and the space provided to take notes.


  - Students at level 1 require focused instruction to accelerate learning in a specific area. Use the
Additional Supports and Pausing Points to target areas of growth.


  - Students at levels 2 and 3 should be showing steady growth. These students would benefit from the
Take Home Materials and side-bar support suggestions within each lesson.


  - Students at level 4 are excelling. Use the side-bar challenge suggestions to increase rigor.

Choose texts from the Grade 3 Fluency Packet or the Unit Readers for students to read aloud
as you measure their pace and accuracy. Subtract the Words Missed (words that are omitted,
mispronounced, or substituted for another word) from the Total Words in Text to determine the
number of Words Read Correctly. Divide the Words Read Correctly by the Total Words in Text to
determine the students’ accuracy. Record how long it takes the students to read the passage to
determine their Words Per Minute. Consider both accuracy and pace as well as expression when
evaluating a student’s overall fluency.

The more words a student can read and the farther the student can progress in the assessment, the stronger his or her
preparation for the next unit of instruction.


The number of words read correctly indicates the following:


- Students who score 6 or fewer words out of 10 words correctly have minimal preparation for the next unit.


- Students who score 7 out of 10 words correctly have adequate preparation for the next unit.


- Students who score 8 or more words out of 10 words correctly have outstanding preparation for the next unit.


After scoring the assessment, you might find it helpful to
determine which phonemes students missed that caused
them to score below the benchmark for word recognition.

#### Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program


~~**THE SIMPLE VIEW OF READING**~~


Virtually everyone who writes about reading now recognizes that reading comprehension requires
more than just decoding ability. Many reading researchers now subscribe to a view of reading that is
known as “the simple view of reading.” This view, which is associated with reading researchers Philip
Gough and William Tunmer, holds that there are two chief elements that are crucially important to
reading comprehension: decoding skills and language comprehension ability.


To achieve reading comprehension, a person needs to be able to decode the words on the page and
then make sense of those words. The first task is made possible by decoding skills and the second
by language comprehension ability. If the person cannot decode the words on the page, he or she
will not be able to achieve reading comprehension, no matter how much oral language he or she
can understand. Even if the person can decode the words on the page, that in and of itself is still no
guarantee of reading comprehension. Thus, if a person cannot understand sentences when they
hear them, they are unlikely to understand those sentences when reading.


Supporters of the simple view—and there are a growing number of them among reading
researchers—argue that a person’s reading comprehension ability can be predicted, with a high
degree of accuracy, based on two basic measures. The first is a measure of decoding skills (e.g.,
a test of single-word reading or pseudo-word reading). The second is a measure of listening
comprehension. Researchers who hold to the simple view say, “Tell me a person’s decoding ability,
as ascertained by a word-reading task, and tell me that person’s language comprehension ability,
as ascertained by a listening comprehension task, and I can make a very accurate prediction of
that person’s reading comprehension ability.” If the person is an efficient and accurate decoder and
also able to understand a wide range of oral language—for instance, classroom presentations, news
items on the radio or TV, books on tape, etc.—then it is a safe bet the person will also do well on
tests of reading comprehension.


An interesting thing about the simple view of reading is that it can be expressed as an equation:





In this equation, each of the letters is a variable that stands for a specific skill:


R is a measure of reading comprehension ability.



**194**



Foundational Skills 9


D is a measure of decoding skills.


C is a measure of language-comprehension ability as measured using a listening task.


Each of these skills can be quantified as a numerical value between 0 and 1, where 0 stands for no
ability whatsoever and 1 stands for perfect, not-to-be-improved-upon ability. Most people have a
skill level that falls somewhere between these two extremes.


The equation says that if you have some decoding ability (D > 0) and you also have some language
comprehension ability (C > 0), you will probably also have some reading comprehension ability (R >
0). How much reading comprehension ability you have will depend on the exact values of D and C.


What does it mean to have no decoding ability (D = 0)? It means you cannot turn printed words into
spoken words. A person who cannot decode letters on a page cannot read. The person is illiterate.


What does it mean to have no language comprehension ability (C = 0)? It means you do not know
the language, and you cannot understand any of it when you hear other people speaking or reading
aloud in that language.


It is not very common for a person to have decoding ability (D > 0) but not language comprehension
ability (C = 0). Why would you learn to read and write a language you cannot understand? It does
happen. One famous example involves the English poet John Milton, the author of _Paradise Lost_ and
other well-known poems. Milton went blind late in life. Since Braille had not yet been invented, this
meant he could not read for himself. Nevertheless, Milton found a way to keep learning from books:
he had friends and relatives read the books aloud for him. However, he was not always able to find
a scholar who had the free time and the ability needed to read to him in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and
other ancient languages. The solution? Milton taught his daughters to decode these languages so
they could read books in those languages aloud to him. Milton did not teach his daughters the actual
languages—the thousands of words and tens of thousands of meanings. That would have been a
difficult, time-consuming task. He only taught them the rules they would need to turn letters into
sounds. Thus, his daughters acquired solid decoding skills for these languages (D > 0), but they
would have scored a zero on any measure of language comprehension (C = 0). They could turn
symbols into sounds, but they had no idea what the sounds meant. Milton, on the other hand, due
to his blindness, had no functional decoding skills (D = 0). However, by virtue of his great learning,
he was able to understand Hebrew, Latin, and Greek when they were read aloud to him (C > 0).
Between Milton and his daughters, you might say, there was reading comprehension (R), but the
younger generation brought the decoding skills (D) and the elderly poet brought the language
comprehension (C).


The Milton example is an unusual one, but it is possible to give a less unusual one. A decent teacher
can teach you to decode Russian letters (or the letters used in many other writing systems) in the


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program
**195**


**196**



course of a couple days of intensive work. Since you already know a lot about reading, all you would
need to learn is which sound values the unfamiliar letters stand for. Once you learned that, you
would be able to sound out most of the words in the language, but nobody would claim that you are
reading Russian. You would have some rudimentary decoding skills (D > 0), but you would be lacking
language comprehension (C = 0). You would be able to pronounce words, but you would not be able
to make sense of them. Essentially, you would be doing what Milton’s daughters did.


~~**HOW THESE IDEAS INFORM THIS PROGRAM**~~


Although this may seem very abstract and theoretical, there are two ideas here that are very
important for reading instruction and for understanding this program. The first important idea
is that reading comprehension depends crucially on both decoding skills (D) and language
comprehension ability (C); the second is that language comprehension ability takes much longer to
acquire than decoding skills.


Milton chose to teach his daughters decoding skills because he could teach those relatively quickly.
It would have taken him much, much longer to build up their language comprehension abilities.
Likewise, in the hypothetical example just given, a decent teacher could teach you to decode
Russian print in a few days of intensive instruction, but he or she would need to keep working with
you for many weeks—possibly even many years—to teach you enough Russian words and phrases to
understand a movie, make sense of a radio report, or read a short story.


You are facing a similar situation as a teacher in the early grades. You want your students to learn
to read. A crucial first step is to teach them decoding skills. Strong decoding skills can be taught
to most young children throughout Grades K–3. It takes longer to teach decoding skills to young
children who are learning to read for the first time than it does to teach the same skills to adults
who have already learned to read in another language, and it takes longer to teach decoding skills in
English-speaking countries because English spelling is rather complex; but even so, most students
can acquire basic decoding ability in the early grades. The children will continue to automatize their
decoding skills, learn new spelling patterns, and build fluency for many more years, but the basics
can be taught in Grades K–3.


That is not the case with language comprehension ability. It is going to take you and your school
system a long time to build up your students’ language comprehension ability because this is not a
job you can accomplish in the course of a single school year. Rather, language comprehension ability
is acquired over many years. Your students began to develop a rudimentary ability to understand
language even before they could speak and continued to increase their language comprehension
abilities throughout the preschool years. They will make even more gains in your classroom and the
classrooms they join after yours. With each new sentence they read or hear, and each new subject
they study in school, they will be building up background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural
literacy, thus increasing the range of materials they are equipped to understand, first orally and later


Foundational Skills 9


via reading. The more you teach them and the more you expose them to, the more they will be able
to understand. It takes a long time to build up the vocabulary and knowledge needed to make sense
of most stories in a newspaper or magazine, but this buildup is crucial for your students’ reading
abilities: no matter how good their decoding skills may be, they will not understand what they read
unless they have the language comprehension ability to make sense of the words they decode.


The program includes two strands of instruction, and these strands correspond with the elements of
reading isolated in the simple view of reading. The Skills Strand is meant to build students’ decoding
skills (D), while the Knowledge Strand is meant to build students’ language comprehension ability
(C) by exposing them to vocabulary, concepts, and ideas through frequent reading aloud. It is
important to understand that both strands are crucial for reading comprehension in later grades.
You may feel the decoding skills taught in the Skills Strand are more important to teach in the early
grades, and certainly, this is the area where you can expect to have the most immediate impact,
but it is important that you not neglect language comprehension ability. Remember, it takes many
years to build up enough vocabulary and general knowledge to understand a wide range of printed
materials. The building of background knowledge needs to begin in Kindergarten (if not before) and
continue throughout the elementary and middle school years.


If students are not building their language comprehension ability in the early grades, their reading
scores are likely to begin to fall off in Grade 4 and later. This has been called the “fourth-grade
slump,” and it occurs because material assessed on reading tests changes over time. As students
progress through the grades, test questions focus less on rudimentary decoding skills and more
on comprehension—and comprehension depends on having sufficient vocabulary, background
knowledge, and cultural literacy to understand the words you are decoding. Thus, the importance
of language comprehension ability increases with time. A weakness in this area may not show up on
tests in early grades, but it will show up in later elementary grades.


This has been well documented in research. In one very interesting study, researchers at the
University of Kansas looked at measurements of reading comprehension (R), decoding/word
recognition (D), and listening comprehension (C) for the same 570 students in the second, fourth,
and eighth grades. They found the two factors D and C accurately predicted R in each grade
but that C became more important, in the sense that it explained more of the variation among
students over time. The measure of decoding (D) was extremely important in the second-grade
results. Twenty-seven percent of the variance in reading comprehension in second grade could be
explained by decoding skills (D) alone. Only 9 percent of the variance could be explained by listening
comprehension (C) alone. By fourth grade, however, the measure of listening comprehension
had begun to account for more variance: the unique contribution of C rose to 21 percent, while
the equivalent number for D fell. By eighth grade, fully 36 percent of the variance in reading
comprehension scores could be explained with reference to the children’s listening comprehension
ability. The unique contribution of D sank even further. In other words, while reading comprehension
depended on D and C at every stage, as the simple view would predict, C explained more and more


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program
**197**


**198**



of the variation among students as time went by. What this tells us is that, once the intricacies of
decoding are mastered (and in English, this takes some time), reading comprehension depends
more and more heavily on language comprehension. Language comprehension depends on
background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural literacy.


~~**TWO MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT READING AND WRITING**~~


The Skills Strand teaches the mechanics of both reading and writing. It is based on the most current
research on reading and writing, but at the same time, it has been written in opposition to some ideas
that have been very influential in elementary education in recent decades. Two of those ideas are:


 - Learning to read and write is natural.


 - Learning to read and write is easy.


Both of these ideas have great emotional appeal. Unfortunately, both of them are wrong.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT NATURAL**~~


Many scholars have argued that spoken language is natural for human beings. The cognitive
scientist Stephen Pinker, for example, has argued that human beings have a language instinct,
meaning that humans are born with an innate capacity for learning language. This may turn out to
be true. It is at least a plausible theory since historians, linguists, and anthropologists have never
found a human culture that does not use language. When something is universal, it may turn out to
be natural.


What is true of oral language is not necessarily true of written language. In fact, with written
language, we know we are dealing with something that is not natural or innate because we know
when and where writing was invented, and we know that, even today, not all languages have a
system of writing. There are still hundreds of languages in the world that are spoken but not written
or read.


Ten thousand years ago this was the norm rather than an exception. At that time, there were
probably no human beings who knew how to read or write. According to the linguist Florian
Coulmas, the idea of writing down language was probably developed independently by three ancient
cultures: the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, and the Chinese. Each used a slightly different system, and
the mechanisms these pioneers developed for recording speech then spread from one culture to
another, evolving as they went. If these initial inventors had not come up with schemes for writing
down speech, we might all be illiterate today.


Writing is many things. It is an art that can be taught and learned. It is an invention—one of the
greatest inventions in human history. It is a technology enabling us to do things we could not do


Foundational Skills 9


without it—a technology every bit as exciting and amazing as airplane flight or electric power. But
it is not natural. The same is true of reading, which is simply the process of unpacking, or decoding,
what somebody else has written.


Reading and writing are both highly artificial. We tend to recoil at that word. We have internalized the
idea that natural is good and artificial is bad. Therefore, we think, reading must be natural. In fact, as
the reading researcher Philip Gough has written, reading is a highly unnatural act.


The first step toward good reading and writing instruction is to understand that reading and writing
are artificial—but not necessarily in a bad sense. We need to remind ourselves that the word _artificial_
derives from the word _art_ . To say reading and writing are forms of art that had to be invented and
need to be taught to children does not make reading and writing any less wonderful or important.
On the contrary, it makes these things more wonderful and precious, and it also emphasizes the
importance of your job as a teacher. There is no job more important than teaching young children
the magnificent, valuable, and highly unnatural arts of reading and writing.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT EASY**~~


The second idea noted earlier, that learning to read and write is easy, is also mistaken. Reading and
writing are complex behaviors, and they are more complex in English than in many other languages
because English has a fairly complicated spelling system. In Spanish, for example, the relationships
between letters and sounds are mostly one-to-one, meaning each sound is usually written with
one spelling, and each spelling unit is usually pronounced one way. This is not the case in English.
To read and write English with a high degree of accuracy, there is quite a lot that students need to
learn.


As a way of demonstrating the complexity involved in learning to read and write in English, suppose
we attempted to list all the discrete bits of information a person needs to know in order to be able
to read and write in English. As a starting point, we might begin with the 26 letters and argue that
these are the 26 things one really needs to learn to read and write English. However, for each letter,
one eventually needs to learn not only the letter shape but also the letter name (to be able to read
abbreviations and initials). So that is 52 bits of information.


That is a good start, but we must not stop there. In English, all letters can be written in uppercase
and lowercase forms, and the uppercase forms are not always the same as the lowercase forms.
Compare ‘B’ to ‘b,’ ‘D’ to ‘d,’ ‘H’ to ‘h,’ ‘R’ to ‘r,’ and ‘Q’ to ‘q.’ At least 16 uppercase letters have a slightly
different form than the matching lowercase letters. So we must raise our estimate of the complexity
of the English writing system to 68 bits of information.


We are not done yet. Students must also know the 44 sounds these letters stand for. That raises our
estimate of the complexity to 112.


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program
**199**


**200**



If there were a simple one-to-one relationship between letters and sounds, that might be a fairly
good estimate of the complexity of the code. Unfortunately, the relationships between sounds and
letters in English are quite complicated. The 44 sounds of English can be spelled many different
ways. In our work on this program, we have identified 150 spellings that are frequent enough to be
worth teaching in the early grades. That boosts our estimate of the complexity of the code to 262.


In addition, students need to learn to track from left to right, blend sounds into words (when
reading), and segment words into sounds (when writing and spelling). They need to learn a handful
of symbols used in writing, including the period, comma, exclamation point, question mark,
quotation mark, and apostrophe. That raises our estimate of code complexity to about 270 bits of
information.


We could boost the estimate even higher by adding Tricky Words and unusual spellings or by
pointing out that many letters in English can be pronounced in different ways. We could also point
out that reading a word like _thin_ requires students to group the first two letters and attach them to
one sound, and reading a word like _cake_ requires students to scan ahead, see the ‘e,’ and realize it
controls the pronunciation of the ‘a’ earlier.


Even without these additions, it is clear that the English writing system is quite complicated.


~~**THE PROBLEM WITH WHOLE LANGUAGE**~~


On a conservative estimate, there are 270 bits of knowledge a person needs to be able to read and
write English. It is unwise to ask students to tackle all this complexity at once and hope they will
figure it out. Yet that is precisely what is done in so-called “Whole Language” approaches. Whole
Language instruction is based on the assumption that learning to read is natural and not difficult,
so reading skills can be allowed to develop gradually, without much explicit instruction. Lots of
students in Whole Language classrooms do manage to figure out the English writing system, but
many others do not. Whole Language ideas have tremendous emotional appeal, but the Whole
Language approach is actually a recipe for _leaving many children behind_ . It is an especially risky
strategy for disadvantaged children.


A much better strategy is to introduce the English spelling code explicitly, beginning with the
easiest, least ambiguous, and most frequently used parts of the code and then adding complexity
gradually. That is the central strategy on which this program is based.


The strategy adopted in this program is the same strategy that successful coaches use when
teaching children a sport such as tennis. The successful coach does not ask students to learn
“Whole Tennis” and soak up the necessary skills all at once by trying to hit all different kinds of
shots the first day on the court. Instead, the successful coach teaches the student to hit a forehand
ground stroke and provides lots of practice hitting forehands. Then the coach moves on to teach


Foundational Skills 9


a backhand ground stroke, then a forehand volley, then a backhand volley, then a serve, then an
overhead smash, then a drop shot, etc. With each element taught, the student becomes a stronger
and more complete player. In the same way, this program begins by teaching the most common and
least ambiguous spellings for sounds and then moves on to introduce the more complex parts of the
writing system.


~~**KEY ASPECTS OF THE SKILLS STRAND**~~


Some key aspects of the Skills Strand are listed below.


  - This program teaches reading and writing in tandem, since they are inverse processes. English
writing involves making pictures of sounds; reading involves translating those pictures back into
sounds and blending the sounds to make words.


  - This program includes explicit, systematic phonic instruction in which students are taught target
skills needed to independently decode and encode words.


  - This program explicitly teaches letter-sound correspondences as opposed to leaving students to
figure these out on their own or deduce them by analyzing familiar whole words (as in some forms of
“analytic” phonics).


  - This program focuses on sounds, or phonemes, as the primary organizing principle of the program,
rather than letters.


  - This program focuses consistently on the phoneme, or single sound, and not on larger units.
Students learn to read words that contain onsets, rimes, and consonant clusters, but they learn to
view and process these larger units as combinations of smaller phoneme-level units. Rimes like _–ick_
and initial clusters like _st–_ are not taught as units but as combinations.


  - This program uses a synthetic phonics approach that teaches students to read by blending through
the whole word; it does not teach multiple cueing strategies, use of pictures as a primary resource in
decoding, or part-word guessing.


  - This program begins by teaching the most common or least ambiguous spelling for a sound (the
basic code spelling); later it teaches spelling alternatives for sounds that can be spelled several
different ways. Thus, the system is kept simple at first, and complexity is added bit by bit as students
gain confidence and automatize their reading and writing skills.


  - This program includes words, phrases, and stories for students to read and activity pages for them to
complete that allow for focused, distributed practice working with the letter-sound correspondences
they have been taught.


  - This program does not require students to read words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have learned. In other words, all words students are asked to read as
part of the program are decodable, either because they are composed entirely of letter-sound


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program
**201**


**202**



correspondences students have been taught or because they are Tricky Words that have been
taught. This means students have a chance to begin reading words and stories that are completely
decodable before tackling words and stories that are full of spelling alternatives.


 - This program does not require students to write words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have been taught. In other words, students are only asked to write words that
can be spelled (at least plausibly if not always correctly) using the code knowledge they have been
taught.


 - This program carefully controls the introduction of Tricky Words and words with ambiguous or rare
spellings, preferring to have students learn to read and write with regular words that can be blended
and spelled by the letter-sound correspondences taught.


 - High-frequency words compiled from a research-based list for Grade 3 are also taught as they appear
in the unit Readers. They are revisited frequently to build automaticity and fluency.


 - This program avoids letter names because what is important for reading is not the letter name but
the sound value the letter stands for. To read the word _cat_, it is essential to know /k/ /a/ /t/, not “see
aay tee.”


~~**THE BASIC AND ADVANCED CODE**~~


The program teaches the highly complex letter-sound correspondences of the English language
in an explicit and systematic manner in Kindergarten–Grade 3. Students are taught how the 26
letters (or graphemes) of the alphabet are used in various combinations to represent 44 sounds (or
phonemes). There are approximately 150 different spellings for these sounds.


Students are first taught the basic code for each of the 44 phonemes. The basic code spelling for
a sound is usually the most common, or the least ambiguous, spelling for a sound. By learning
these letter-sound correspondences first, students experience a high degree of predictability, and
therefore success, in decoding words with these spellings.


Basic code spellings may be single letters, such as these spellings and sounds: ‘a’ > /a/, ‘e’ > /e/,
‘b’ > /b/, and ‘m’ > /m/. Basic code spellings may also include digraphs, or two letters to represent
a sound, such as ‘ee’ > /ee/, ‘oy’ > /oi/, ‘ou’ > /ow/, ‘sh’ > /sh/, and ‘th’ > /th/. Other basic code
spellings include separated digraphs, such as ‘a_e’ > /ae/, and ‘o_e’ > /oe/.


The advanced code consists of all other spelling alternatives (over 100) that may be used to spell
the 44 phonemes in English. Examples of alternative spellings include ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘ss’ > /s/, ‘c’

- /s/, ‘g’ > /j/, ‘ay’ > /ae/, and ‘ey’ > /ee/. Some of these spelling alternatives occur relatively
frequently in the English language, while others are quite rare. See the provided charts for the basic
and advanced code.

~~**TRICKY WORDS**~~


The term _Tricky Word_ is used in this program to refer to a word that does not “play by the rules” of
spelling and/or pronunciation. Examples of Tricky Words include _one_, _said_, _of_, _were_, and _have_ .


You can describe the trickiness of a Tricky Word like _said_ in two ways. If you think about it from a
spelling point of view, you might say that the word _said_ is tricky because the sound /e/ is not spelled
with an ‘e,’ as you might expect it would be. On the other hand, if you think about it from a reading
point of view, you might say the word is tricky because the letters ‘ai’ are not pronounced /ae/, as
you might expect they would be. Either way you look at it, _said_ is a Tricky Word.


But notice that the word is not completely irregular, either. The first letter and the last letter are
pronounced exactly as you would expect. It is only the second and third letters, representing the
vowel sound, that are not sounded as you would expect. Or, if you prefer to look at things from the
speller’s perspective, you might say the first and last sound are spelled just as you would expect; it
is only the middle sound—the vowel sound—that is spelled irregularly. This is the case with many
Tricky Words: most of them have a regular part (or parts) and then a tricky part. More often than
not, you will find that the tricky part involves the vowel sound and its spelling.


When you are asked to teach a Tricky Word, the guidelines in the Teacher Guide will generally prompt
you to begin by reminding students that not all words play by the rules and words that do not play
by the rules are called Tricky Words. Next, the Teacher Guide will generally suggest that you write
the Tricky Word on the board. You may wish to ask a student to read the word as he or she thinks it
might be sounded (i.e., to blend according to the normal procedures). Alternatively, you can read the
Tricky Word that way yourself. Then you can point out how the word is actually pronounced. Once
you have established the actual pronunciation, you can point out and/or discuss what is regular and
what is irregular about the word. Most Tricky Words have at least some parts pronounced exactly the
way you would expect. For example, as noted above, the first and last letter in _said_ are pronounced
just as one would expect. After discussing the regular parts, you should then draw attention to the
tricky part (or parts) of the word, pointing out letters not pronounced as one might expect they
would be (e.g., the ‘ai’ in _said_ ). This is the part of the word that students just have to remember.


By drawing attention to the regular as well as the irregular parts of the word, you teach students
that Tricky Words are only partial exceptions to the normal rules of reading and writing. (They are
not so much irregular as they are a little less regular than most words.) There are some parts of the
word spelled just as you would expect and also pronounced just as you would expect. Then there are
some others that are not. There is a subtle but important difference between teaching Tricky Words
this way and teaching them as single entities that have to be memorized as wholes, as if every part
of the word were unpredictable.


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program
**205**


Note that some Tricky Words are actually part of spelling patterns. For example, the words _he_, _she_,
_we_, _be_, and _me_ are taught as Tricky Words in earlier grades because it is hard to write stories without
them. However, once the ‘e’ spelling alternative for /ee/ is taught, these Tricky Words can be seen
as part of a larger pattern that includes words like _replay_ and _prefix_ . Other Tricky Words, such as
_one_ and _of_, remain tricky even when most of the spelling alternatives have been taught. By Grade 3,
students have been taught the majority of the code knowledge needed to decode most words in the
English language. As such, there is less of an emphasis on Tricky Words in the Grade 3 program.


~~**SIGHT WORDS AND TRICKY WORDS**~~


One of the most common terms in the world of reading instruction is _sight word_ . Unfortunately, this
is also a rather ambiguous and potentially confusing term. Educators use the term _sight word_ in
two different senses. For some people, sight words are high-frequency words that students need to
encounter frequently and learn to decode rapidly and effortlessly. Other people use the term _sight_
_word_ in a more restrictive sense, to refer to words that cannot be sounded out using letter-sound
correspondences and may need to be taught as exceptions.


In this program, we define these terms as follows:


     - A Tricky Word is a word that does not play by the rules. It is a word containing at least one part that
cannot be read correctly via blending or cannot be spelled correctly using the code knowledge taught
so far.


     - A sight word is a high-frequency word that we want students to see many, many times and learn to
read quickly and eventually learn to recognize rapidly.


The main difference here is that a Tricky Word always contains some irregular element, whereas a
sight word might or might not.


There is considerable overlap between the two categories (which is probably why the two senses of
_sight word_ are regularly confused). Some words qualify as sight words because they are used a lot
and also as Tricky Words because they are not pronounced (or written) as you would expect. These
are words that are both irregular (and therefore hard to read and write, at least at first) and also very
common (and therefore important for student success). They are candidates for special instruction,
and many of them are given special instruction in this program.


Tricky Words do not qualify as sight words on most lists because they are not especially common.
Words of this sort are sprinkled throughout the language but do not receive much attention because
they are only used occasionally. Students can learn them as the need arises in upper grades.

~~**CUSTOMIZING AND ADAPTING THE PROGRAM**~~


This is a highly structured and sequenced program. We are unapologetic about that, as we believe
the structure and sequence will be very helpful to students as they work to learn the English spelling
code. However, this is not a scripted program in which teachers are required to read the manual and
give one of a handful of approved responses. We expect—indeed, we hope—teachers will tweak the
phrasing and come up with ways to customize, personalize, and adapt the instruction.


Our goal has been to put things in a logical order and provide all the guidance and support
necessary for a new teacher, or a teacher new to this kind of phonics instruction.


At the same time, we believe there is room for experienced and creative teachers to customize
and adapt the program. Indeed, some of the exercises included in this version of the program were
developed by teachers in our pilot programs!


Sometimes in the lessons, we give exact phrasing that we suggest you use; more often, however, we
give indirect phrasing and/or encourage you to explain something using your own words. You should
feel free to make changes to the phrasing. For example, you may prefer to speak of “a picture of a
sound” or a “spelling.” Later in the year, you may want to teach the term _digraph_, or you may prefer
to refer to the letters in a digraph as a “letter team” or as “buddy letters.” There are many ways to
customize the program and the language while preserving the basic instructional principles and
sequence of instruction.


For the presentation of words, you may write on a chalkboard, a whiteboard, chart paper, an
overhead projector, a document camera, or the projection system of your choice. A projection
system works especially well for activity pages since it allows the teacher to model the task exactly
as the students will be completing it. You may use a pocket chart, a magnetic board with magnetic
letters, an overhead projector with letters cut from a transparency, or a smart board. Many
modifications of this sort can be made without adversely impacting the quality of the instruction.


You should also always feel free to add additional activities and activity pages that are consistent
with our philosophy of instruction. You should always feel free to respond to the teachable moment,
even if it leads you slightly off the path laid out in the Teacher Guide.


There are only a handful of things you should not do:


You should not skip a lesson in which new code knowledge is taught. If you do, students will lack
important code knowledge, untaught spellings will begin to appear in their word lists and on their
activity pages, and the lessons will start to make less sense to them.


For the same reasons, you should not reorder the lessons. The program relies heavily on sequencing,
and instruction will be confused and less effective if the lessons are reordered.


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program
**207**


~~**SMALL-GROUP WORK**~~


Large parts of this program have been written for whole-group instruction, but the program can be
customized to allow for small-group instruction of various kinds. You will note that there are Support
and Challenge sidebars sprinkled throughout the lessons that will guide you in how to differentiate
instruction for your students, while still using the whole-class approach described in the lessons.


Since some students will learn the new information right away while others will need more practice,
you may wish to do small-group work to follow up the initial introduction of code knowledge. You will
note that many lessons do include suggestions for small groups; you should feel free to adapt these
and other lessons as best meets the needs of your students. We have seen this program taught very
effectively in small groups and in workstations students visit on rotation.


~~**ADJUSTING THE SPEED OF INSTRUCTION**~~


This sequence will work for most children. However, all children are different, and all classrooms are
different. Some classrooms may need more time to master concepts than others. The program has
been designed so the pace of instruction can be adjusted as needed.


The most important thing for you to know is that you can pause at any point in the program.
If students are not learning the material, simply stop where you are and do additional work to
accelerate or reteach as needed. All lessons contain some materials you can use if you pause.


In addition, at the end of each unit there is a “Pausing Point.” If the end-of-unit assessment or your
observations suggest some members of the class need additional time to master the concepts
taught in the unit, this is an especially good place to stop and provide additional practice and
review. The Teacher Guides include additional work at each Pausing Point. They will typically provide
enough for at least 1–2 days of additional work. The materials provided in the Pausing Point can be
used in various ways. Sometimes you may wish to have all students do the same activity or activity
page. At other times you may wish to work individually or in small groups with students who are
struggling with a particular concept.


To slow down instruction, you can pause either in the middle of a unit or at a Pausing Point. We do
not recommend that you attempt to speed up the sequence of instruction. The program lays out an
ambitious program of instruction.


The Grade 3 program of instruction should work well for a wide range of students. You should begin
with the assumption that the Grade 3 program is an appropriate option for all students in the class.


Inevitably, however, there will be differences in learning. Students learn at different rates. Some
students will pick up the material quickly; others will have more difficulty. There are many strategies


Foundational Skills 9
**208**


for dealing with this. In general, we encourage you to try to keep most of the class together if it
makes sense. It is much easier to teach one set of students at roughly the same level than it is to
teach two or three groups at very different levels.


If you find some students are lagging, you may still be able to keep the class together for the main
lessons but find extra time two to four times a week to work with those students who seem to need
extra practice.


If this is not sufficient, you may eventually need to regroup some students. As we note in Lessons
4–5 of this unit, it is especially important to administer the placement assessment to all students at
the start of the year. We strongly recommend that teachers then use an “across grade” approach to
grouping students. If there are two classrooms, these two teachers should look at all of the Grade 3
students in both classrooms and consider regrouping students for Skills instruction only, with one
teacher taking the class of students who need review and more practice, while the other teacher
works with those students ready to move on to Grade 3 Skills instruction. It will likely be worthwhile
to reconvene at multiple times during the year to plan across the grade level, using the end-of-unit
assessments. In this way, students in need of acceleration can be moved to the appropriate group,
while students who are making progress can advance.

**Appendix C:**
#### Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words

Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught will enable students to read onesyllable words with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences is no
guarantee that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllabic words. To this
end, most students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk, and read
parts of words—syllables—to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can then
be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated, and students are expected
to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, the program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the easiest
two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is already a
familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In addition, each
syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing, hunt·er, bust·ed_ ). The
dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain double-letter
spellings for consonants, in this program, the divider is typically placed after the double-letter
spelling rather than between the two consonants (e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers that are
familiar with other ways to chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is done, however,
because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single-spelling units since kindergarten
(‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.). The program strives to be consistent in representing these
spellings in the way that the students have been taught to process them (e.g., as whole entities
for a sound). (Ultimately, as students become more proficient at decoding and chunking syllables
through subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually chunk and decode
these words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding these two-syllable
words consisting of root words and suffixes relatively easy.


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable words.


Appendix C: Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words
**219**


To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


**• Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound (e.g.,**

/ **a** / **,** / **e** / **,** / **i** / **,** / **o** / **,** / **u** / **):** _let_, _pad_, _rod_, _tin_, _fun_, _pic·nic_, _un·til_


**• Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g.,** / **ae** / **,** / **ee** / **,** /
**ie** / **,** / **oe** / **,** / **ue** / **):** _cake_, _home_, _like_, _mule_, _Pete_, _mis·take_, _stam·pede_


**• Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint_, _speak_, _proud_, _play_, _dis·may_, _be·low_, _coun·sel_


**• R-Controlled Syllables:** _art_, _curb_, _girl_, _fort_, _clerk_, _tur·nip_, _ar·tist_, _fe·ver_


**• Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g.,** / **ae** / **,** / **ee** / **,** / **ie** / **,**
/ **oe** / **,** / **ue** / **):** _go_, _me_, _hi_, _a·pron_, _f·nal_, _com·pre·hend_


**• Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple_, _puz·zle_, _raf·fe_, _ca·ble_, _ri·fe_


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


**• Schwa Syllables:** _ben·e·fit_, _ap·pe·tite_, _a·bout_, _hos·pit·al_, _e·mo·tion_


Note: The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately because
of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


To decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these names. The names of the
syllable types are provided here only to establish a common vocabulary for teachers as they use
the materials. What is necessary, however, for students to become fluent readers of longer words in
increasingly complex text is that they be able to visually parse certain spelling patterns as syllable
chunks so they can quickly and easily decode each syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.


Foundational Skills 9
**220**


_ad·mit_ _nap·kin_ t _rum·pet_


For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed after
the double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is because the
double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units since kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’

- /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).


_traff·ic_ _muff·in_ _happ·en_


When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.


_mon·ster_ _con·tract_ _pil·grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read
the first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model
for students how to blend the two syllables aloud:







In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the magic
‘E’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for closed
syllables:


_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


In Grades 2 and 3, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to use


Appendix C: Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words
**221**


a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying each
possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:


_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_









However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There is
no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be flexible
and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to determine
whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. To recognize whether a
word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has heard before
(i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent an additional
challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a second language.


If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:


Foundational Skills 9
**222**


_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is straightforward.


When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings
in the words.


_ban · gle_ _twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_









Appendix C: Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words
**223**


In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings represent
the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a combination of
stressed and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed or weakly
stressed, its vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that linguists call
a schwa. This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’
and ‘tion’. Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite challenging for
many students.


Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the
schwa sound has a particular spelling:


_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is a schwa syllable, but it is identified separately
because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables
accordingly throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness_ _help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten–Grade
3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.
