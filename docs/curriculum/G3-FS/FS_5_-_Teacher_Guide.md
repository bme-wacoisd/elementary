**Grade 3 | Foundational Skills 5**
###### Introduction


~~**UNIT OVERVIEW**~~


Unit 5 focuses on r-controlled multisyllabic words, emphasizing the /er/ sound with _er_, _ir_, and _ur_
spellings. Students also explore less common /er/ sounds in _or_ and _ar_ (e.g., _odor, cellar_ ). Understanding
these syllables is key to improving reading fluency and comprehension. The unit includes morphology
lessons on suffixes such as _–ous, –ly, –ive, –y_, and _–en_, enhancing vocabulary and reading/ spelling
skills. Students also learn to identify and segment words with the VCCCV pattern, aiding in the
pronunciation and spelling of complex words. This comprehensive approach is designed to boost
students’ linguistic capabilities effectively.


~~**TRICKY SPELLINGS**~~


As new spellings are introduced, complexity is added to the reading process. Some of the spelling
units that students have to process are ambiguous in the sense that they can stand for more than
one sound. These ambiguous spellings are called “tricky spellings.” Earlier, in Unit 3, instruction
focused on split digraphs or VCe spellings. In Unit 5, students build on this concept by examining
how a consonant suffix, especially when attached to a base word that ends in silent _e_, changes the
spelling of the base word.


~~**TRICKY WORDS & HIGH-FREQUENCY WORDS**~~


Tricky Words are introduced in this unit on an as-needed basis in the context of the different
selections included in the Reader. Tricky Words should be taught in the lessons before the reading
selections are assigned. When introducing Tricky Words, be sure to draw attention to the parts that
are read (and spelled) just as students would expect based on what they have learned so far, and
also point out the tricky parts of each word.


The Tricky Words taught in this unit are:


  - Lesson 1 - _sorry_


  - Lesson 2 - _guitar_


  - Lesson 4 - _library_


  - Lesson 10 - _figure_


  - Lesson 11 - _silhouettes_


  - Lesson 12 - _carousel_


Introduction
**1**


In addition to addressing Tricky Words and tricky spellings, this program emphasizes the reading
and spelling of high-frequency words that have been carefully selected from word lists compiled by
researchers Edward William Dolch and Edward Fry. The selection of these words was based on their
prevalence within the Reader, and instruction is integrated into lessons at points where students will
naturally encounter these words within the assigned sections of the Reader.


The high-frequency words taught in this unit are:


     - Lesson 1 - _hear, saw_


     - Lesson 2 - _those, close_


      - Lesson 3 - _stop, got_


     - Lesson 5 - _might_


     - Lesson 6 - _light_


     - Lesson 7 - _white_


     - Lesson 11 - _warm_


The curriculum includes a structured approach for teaching high-frequency words, starting with
the introduction of 8–12 keywords at the beginning of each unit, selected for their relevance and
frequency in the unit’s text. Words are introduced using phonetic sounding and Spelling Cards for
decoding. Throughout the unit, these words are reviewed in various contexts, including through
decode/encode games and fluency checkpoints to assess automaticity and fluency. This ensures
that students engage with the words multiple times, enhancing their reading skills and confidence.


~~**READER: ADVENTURES OF MARCUS AND CORY**~~


In the Unit 5 Reader, main characters Marcus and Cory marvel at the everyday sounds around
them, such as car beeps and barking dogs, realizing that each sound has a reason and importance.
In school, they learn about different musical instruments, leading them to explore various sounds
in their town. This exploration continues at a party, where they learn from a musician about the
science of sound. Fascinated, they create their own homemade instruments and delve deeper
into understanding sound production and how humans perceive sound. Their adventures include
attending a concert with protective headphones for ear protection, exploring the outdoors, and
learning about light at a science center. They play with flashlights and shadows, visit an amusement
park to experience lights and sounds, and even make a color wheel, discovering the beauty and
science behind everyday experiences. The story ends with a spectacular fireworks display at the
amusement park, symbolizing the boys’ illuminated understanding and their strong friendship.

~~**UNIT 5 ASSESSMENT**~~


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


Throughout this unit, formative assessments are clearly marked for monitoring individual student
performance and progress in key skills. Quick Checks for Understanding to evaluate classroom
performance as a whole are also designated in each lesson. Fluency practice takes place regularly
throughout the unit. Records for recording student performance in an Anecdotal Reading Record,
Grade 3 Foundational Skills Record, Grade 3 Fluency Record, and Grade 3 End-of-Year Summary are
included in the Teacher Resources.


**Student Performance Assessment**


In Lessons 14 and 15, you will be prompted to administer a multipart end-of-unit assessment. In the
first part, you will work one-on-one with students to complete the Fluency Assessment. Students will
engage in a review activity while awaiting their turn for the assessment. The Reading and Spelling
portion of the assessment takes place during the first twenty minutes of the second lesson. Once
students have completed the assessment, they will have time for Self-Sustained Reading. Use time in
this lesson to finish working with students who still need to complete the Fluency Assessment from
the previous lesson.


The target words in each of these assessments include the vowel sound/spellings taught in this
unit; distractors have been intentionally selected because they represent frequent sound/spelling
confusions. Student performance on these assessments is a good indicator of whether students have
mastered the new sound/spellings.


~~**CURSIVE WRITING**~~


At Grade 3, students are expected to write neatly in cursive, using correct letter formation and
leaving space between words. Throughout the program, teachers are prompted to remind students
of this expectation and provide corrective feedback.


Note that the lessons and activity pages do not comprise an exhaustive handwriting program, and
teachers may wish to consult other sources for information on topics such as writing posture, pencil
grip, and differentiated instruction for left-handed students.


Introduction

~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


Pausing Point suggestions for further practice and reinforcement appear at the end of the unit,
following the last unit lesson 15. It is strongly recommended that you pause for one or two days at
the end of each unit to solidify the skills introduced in it. All students will benefit from an additional
opportunity to reread pages from the Readers. It is particularly important to make use of targeted
activities if the end-of unit assessment and/or formative assessments indicate that any students
are experiencing difficulties with specific skills taught during the unit.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available in the program’s online materials. This
component has been designed to complement the unit. It consists of poetry, folklore, and fables.
These additional text selections provide opportunities for students to practice reading with fluency
and prosody (expression). See the Unit 1 introduction or directions in the Fluency Supplement for
further guidance.

Lesson 1 Review: R-Controlled Syllables: _er_, _ir_, _ur_
**7**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


The next several lessons explore r-controlled syllables. The first two lessons focus
on three common spellings for the /er/ sound: _er, ir,_ and _ur_ . It would be helpful
for students to know that the /er/ sound is spelled with an _er_ pattern in about
three-fourths of English words with that sound; however, there are other spellings
that they will have to learn. Subsequent lessons in this unit will target _or_ and _ar_
spellings, which can also make the /er/ sound in some words (e.g., _odor, cellar_ );
however, they will be taught with their more frequent pronunciations as well.


**Foundational Skills**

                      - Prepare the /er/ Words Chart on chart paper with an additional fourth

column labeled “Odd Ducks.”


) **Digital Component 1.1**


                      - Create an enlarged version of /er/ Words Chart to display, or prepare to

display the digital version.


**Reading**

                  - Preview the section of the Reader that will be read during this lesson to be

familiar with the text students are reading aloud when listening to make
notes on Anecdotal Reading Records.


**Universal Access**

                 - Challenge students by asking them to think of different multisyllabic words

containing _er_, _ir_, and _ur_ than the examples provided during Practice with
Reading and Dictation. Have them use these words in sentences. Encourage
students to think of words with the _ir_ and _ur_ spelling patterns that make
sounds other than /er/, such as _curious or spirit._


                   - Prepare a list of _er, ir,_ and _ur_ words such as _curious, birthday, squirt, perfect,_
_number, water, different, return, disturb_ .


                      - Prepare sentence stems to provide to students:


                        - __ is a r-controlled word.

                        - I put the word __ here because the r-controlled syllable is __.

                        - I chose ____ because the r-controlled syllable is __.

                        - I notice that…

                        - In this picture, I see…

                        - Some sounds you may hear are ______.

                        - You hear these sound every day because ______.

                        - Some important sounds are ______. They are important because _____.

~~**REVIEW R-CONTROLLED SYLLABLES ER, IR, AND UR (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Display the Spelling Cards for /er/ > _er_, _ir_, and _ur_ and read the examples
provided. Students may also refer to their Individual Code Charts.


  - Have students turn and talk about r-controlled syllables. In students’
discussions, they may talk about syllables that have a vowel followed by an ‘r’.
In this type of syllable, the vowel isn’t pronounced with its regular long or short
sound; the letter ‘r’ and the /r/ sound control the sound of the vowel. Have
students think of r-controlled words and share with their turn and talk partner.


  - Remind students that the letter ‘r’ is a spelling for a consonant sound, but
the sound /r/ can mingle with certain vowel sounds to create unique vowel
sounds like /er/.


  - Write these words in cursive on the board, and model each letter formation
while writing: _follow, follower_ . Underline _er_ .


  - Prompt students to turn and talk: How do we know that _er_ is a vowel sound?
_(Because when it is added to follow, it adds a syllable to the word.)_


  - Write these words in cursive on the board, and ask students to read them in
unison, clapping the syllables: _perfect, interrupt,_ and _number._


  - Ask students to listen and look for the /er/ syllable in each of the words and
identify which syllable contains that sound.

                      - Explain that _Adventures of Marcus and Cory_ contains many high-frequency

words. Remind students that these are common words, so they will come
across them often as they read, in both the Reader and in many different
texts. Learning to recognize these words and their spellings will improve their
overall reading and writing fluency.


                      - Display this lesson’s high-frequency words: _hear_ and _saw_ .


Foundational Skills 5
**12**


  - Preview the Table of Contents, reading aloud the chapter names or calling on
students to read them aloud.


  - Ask: Why do you think we might often come across the words _hear_ and
_saw_, and other forms of these verbs, as we read about these boys and their
adventures? _(Many of their adventures have to do with experiencing and_
_learning about sound or hearing and sight or vision.)_


  - Focus on the word _hear_ . Underline the common trigraph _ear_, and remind them
that they’ve learned that its pronunciation can be tricky. Remind students that
in Unit 1 they learned the high-frequency word _near_, which has this trigraph.
The vowel team _ea_ in this trigraph can make different sounds: /ee/ as in _ear_ or
/air/ as in _bear_ . The trigraph _ear_ can also make the /er/ sound, as in _earth_ .


  - Ask: Which is the correct vowel sound in _hear_ : /ee/, /air/, or /er/? For
additional support, display the Spelling Cards for each sound. Confirm that
the correct pronunciation is /h/ /ee/ /r/.


  - Point out that in this Reader, they will also see the high-frequency word _hear_
with the suffix - _ing_ as _hearing_ and with the suffix - _d_ as _heard_ . Display _hearing_
and _heard_ next to hear. Explain that _hear_, hearing, and _heard_ are all forms of
the same verb. _Hear_ and _hearing_ take place in the present; _heard_ is hearing
that happened in the past.


  - Ask: When we add - _ing_ to _hear_ to make the word _hearing_, what sound does
the trigraph _ear_ make? (/ee/)


  - Ask: When we add - _d_ to _hear_ to make the word _heard_, what sound does the
trigraph _ear_ make? (/er/)


  - Display the Tricky Word, read it, and use it aloud in a sentence:


    - _sorry_


  - Point out which parts of the word are regular and can be blended as you
would expect and which parts are not regular and will either be taught later
or simply must be remembered.


  - Tricky Word: _sorry_


    - Expected: /s/, /r/, /ee/


  - Tricky Spelling: The letter ‘o’. is pronounced /o/.


  - Direct students to turn and talk: Based on the title, chapter titles, and
illustrations, what do you think the Reader might be about? _(how light and_
_sound works in everyday life)_


  - Focus students on the first section of Chapter 1, “The Importance of Sound in
Daily Life,” on page 1.

In pairs, have students
look at the images in the
Reader of _Adventures_
_of Marcus and Cory_ and
discuss what they see
using the sentence stems:
“I notice that…” or “In this
picture, I see…” Ask simple
questions: What sounds
do you hear outside? What
sounds do you hear inside?


**Intermediate**


Have students preview
the Reader images in
_Adventures of Marcus and_
_Cory_ and create a bank of
words. Lead students in a
discussion: What are sounds
you hear every day? What
are important sounds you
hear? Provide sentence
stems to help students
with their answers: “Some
sounds you may hear are
______. You hear these
sound every day because
______. Some important
sounds are ______. They are
important because _____.”
Encourage students to listen
to their peers’ responses
and add new ideas to the
discussion.


**Advanced/Advanced High**


Have students use
a graphic organizer
provided by the teacher
to independently write
responses to “How do
certain sounds make you
feel, and why might you
like or dislike them?”


~~**ELPS 2.A; ELPS 4.F**~~

Activity Page 1.2




  - Point out that when multiple characters are having a dialogue, a new

paragraph starts to indicate that there is a new speaker. When students see
a new paragraph while reading dialogue, they can use this cue to change how
their voice sounds—like how high or low it is, or how fast or slow they talk—to
match what the character is feeling or who they are. This makes the story
more interesting and fun for people listening to you read.


  - Pair students with intentional reading partners by using past observations
and assessments to guide pairings.


  - Instruct students to partner read the assigned section of the Reader on page 7.


  - Direct reading partners to focus on reading with expression, especially during
the dialogue.


  - Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension, as well as to check for
their ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words.
Have students listen actively and ask relevant questions to clarify any
information from the text or prompts. Example prompts include:


1. **Literal:** Why does Mrs. Jenkins tell Marcus and Cory to use a softer voice while
they were talking? _(They disturbed her; their voices carried; it’s a small town.)_


2. **Inferential:** What is the most likely reason Marcus and Cory pay such close
attention to the sounds around them as they walk to school? _(They have a_
_strong awareness of what is happening around them even if they cannot see_
_things; they hear footsteps, which means someone is around the corner; they_
_hear a dog barking, so there might be a squirrel nearby.)_


3. **Evaluative:** Based on the conversations between Marcus and Cory, what do
you learn about these boys? _(They know that sound impacts people differently,_
_and that voices and sounds have power to make people feel different things.)_


  - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses.
Provide sentence stems as needed such as:

    - They used a softer voice because...

    - The most likely reason Marcus and Cory pay such close attention to the
sounds on their way to school is because....

    - I learned that the boys...


  - Record notes on the Anecdotal Reading Record about mispronunciations,
self-correction, pacing, transposition of words, and expression.

    - “Ensure that your letters are properly spaced and don’t run into each other.”

    - “You’re doing well with your cursive! Pay attention to the slant of your
letters. Try to keep them all at the same angle.”


  - After finishing the activity, prompt students to turn and talk to share their
responses. Remind students to speak coherently about r-controlled syllables
by keeping appropriate eye contact, controlling their volume, and speaking at
a steady rate.


Activity Page 1.2: Reader Response


Collect and review Activity Page 1.2 to check students’ ability to write sentences

  - Additional differentiation:


    - Some students may enjoy the added challenge of using all words from

the Word Bank in their story.


    - Other students may benefit from working with a partner or even a small

group to develop their stories.

- Explain that students will examine two new high-frequency words. Remind
them that these are common words that they will come across often as they
read and write.


- Display this lesson’s high-frequency words: _those_ and _close_ .


- Ask: What do you notice about these words? ( _They both begin with two_
_consonants and end with the VCe syllable pattern_ ose _._ )


- Focus on the word _those_ . Circle the letters _th_ . Remind them that they have
already learned that ‘t’ and ‘h’ work together to form the consonant digraph
_th_ and that they have already explored two high-frequency words with this
digraph: _thought_ and _something_ .



Foundational Skills 5
**22**


  - Explain that there are two types of /th/ sounds: voiced and unvoiced. Several
other sounds are voiced and unvoiced as well. Remind students that they
have probably learned that when we make sounds, we can either make our
vocal cords vibrate (a voiced sound) or keep our vocal cords open and not
vibrating (a voiceless sound). An easy way to tell if a sound is voiced is to
put two fingers on your voice box, at the top of your throat; you can feel a
vibration in your voice box when you make a voiced sound.


  - Direct students to put two fingers on their voice boxes and say _those_, feeling
the vibration when they make the /th/ sound. Repeat the word three times in
unison. The /th/ in _those_ is a voiced /th/ sound.


  - With fingers still on their voice box, have students say the high-frequency
words _thought_ and _something_ to see that the /th/ is an unvoiced sound.
Explain that the /th/ in these words is made with the tongue and teeth rather
than including the throat.


  - Ask: What sound does the ‘s’ make? _(/z/_ )


  - Focus on the word _close_ . Point out that this word can be pronounced two
ways: /c/ /l/ /oe/ /z/, as in “ _close_ the door”—the same sounds as in _those_   and /c/ /l/ /oe/ /s/ as in “I am standing _close_ to you.” For additional support,
display the Spelling Cards for each sound. Point out that this word is a
homograph: two words that are spelled alike have different pronunciations
and meanings. With homographs, the context in which the word is used is
important to understanding its meaning.


  - Have students turn to their turn and talk partner and come up with two
sentences using both meanings of _close_ . Call on several students to share
their sentences with the class, and ask the class to determine which meaning
of _close_ was used in the sentence.


  - Explain that in _Adventures of Marcus and Cory_, _close_ is used only in its
meaning as the distance between two places. Point to the word _close_, and
ask: Which sound does the ‘s’ make in this meaning of the word? ( _/s/_ )


    - Explain that in this Reader, they will see close with the suffixes – _ly_
( _closely_ ) and – _er_ ( _closer_ ). Point out that adding a suffix does not change
how _close_ is pronounced.


  - Display the Tricky Word, read it aloud, and use it in a sentence:


    - _guitar_


  - Point out which parts of the word are regular and can be blended as you
would expect and which parts are not regular and will either be taught later
or must be remembered.

Example prompts include:


1. **Literal:** What were Marcus and Cory eager to learn about in music
class that day? _(Marcus and Cory were eager to learn about different_
_instruments and how each made its sound.)_


2. **Inferential:** Why do you think Marcus and Cory felt that the music at the
park was a big moment for them? _(Answers may vary but could include_
_that Marcus and Cory found the music at the park to be a big moment_
_because it made them feel the impact of sound bringing people together_
_and making them happy.)_


3. **Evaluative:** How did the boys’ understanding of sounds impact their
decision to visit the park regularly on Saturdays? _(The boys’ understanding_
_of sounds brought them together with other people in the park, made them_
_happy, and inspired them to visit the park regularly to enjoy the music.)_

  - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses.
Have students restate that question in their answers:


    - Marcus and Cory were eager because _____.

    - On page _____, the text states that _____. I think that _______.


  - As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual reading
ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record. Record notes about mispronunciations,
self-correction, pacing, transposition of words, and expression.


~~**WRAP UP (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Have students open to Activity Page 2.1, and follow along with the instructions.


  - Read the directions, and model using the Glossary in the Reader and a
dictionary to discover the pronunciation and definition of words in bold or
unfamiliar words in the text.


  - For Chapter 1, the word in bold is _vibration_ . The word being bolded means
that it will be in the Glossary, which is located at the end of the reader.
The Glossary is in alphabetical order. Look at the first letter of the word
_vibration_ . Find the letter V in the Glossary. Look under the V for the word
_Vibration_ which has the pronunciation (vy-BRAY-shun) and means ‘a shaking
movement or sound.’


  - Tell students that while reading they might come across unfamiliar words
that they want to know the meaning of. If these words are not bolded,
they can use a dictionary to help find the meaning of the word. Use the
word _signaling_ as an example. Remind students that dictionaries are in
alphabetical order. Look at the first letters in signaling. Find the ‘s’ section
in the dictionary, and then look at the next letters until you find the word
_signaling_ . Show the pronunciation and definition to the class.


  - Pass out dictionaries, and have students practice finding word _tune_ . Once
they find it, have them read the pronunciation and definition to a turn and
talk partner. ~~**[ TEKS 3.3.A ]**~~


  - Release students to complete Activity Page 2.1.


  - Remind students to write neatly in cursive, leaving space between words.
Circulate and monitor, providing feedback for proper letter formation. Offer

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Foundational Skills**

                 - Prepare Spelling Cards for /ar/ > _ar (car)_ and /er/ > _ar (dollar)_ .


**Reading**

                  - Preview the section of the Reader that will be read during this lesson to

model fluent paragraph reading with intentional pausing. Consider using
sticky notes to mark this section.


**Universal Access**

                       - Students may benefit from a display of an image (e.g., a star) to remind them of
the /ar/ sound that _ar_ typically represents along with a different image (e.g., a
polar bear) to remind them that _ar_ can represent the /er/ sound in some words.


                 - Use a variety of analogies to help students understand r-controlled

vowels. For example, students can imagine the letter ‘r’ as a sidekick to the
vowel, influencing its sound like a friend might influence your decisions.
Alternatively, describe the vowel and the letter ‘r’ as dance partners: when
they’re together, they move differently than when they’re on their own,
changing the sound they make.


                  - Prepare a word list of _ar_, _er_, _ir_ words ( _gardening, polar, cargo, Thursday,_
_everyone, turn, squirting_ ).


                 - Prepare a graphic organizer to support students in sorting words according
to their r-controlled syllable.


                      - Prepare sentence stems to provide to students:


                        - I found ___, and it means ___.

                        - One key detail from the text is __.

                        - What happened in today’s reading was __.

                        - In this section of the text, the author talks about __.

                        - One key detail in this part of the text is __.

                        - After reading this section, it is clear that __.


                      - Prepare lyrics of students’ favorite patriotic song, such as “The Star
Spangled Banner.”


                      - For additional support with r-controlled syllable _ar_, prepare to pair students
up. Give each pair a copy of the Swim to the Finish Game Board and a set of
Swim to the Finish Word Cards provided in the Additional Support Activity
Page materials section of the Teacher Resources.

  - Ask students what they remember about the spelling _ar_ from the previous
lesson and to state a word containing the sound/spelling. Use sentence
stem: The _ar_ spelling is pronounced____ as in ___. (/ar/ as in _car_ )


  - Remind them that _ar_ most often represents the /ar/ sound, but it can also

represent the /er/ sound. The ‘r’ controls the sound of the syllable.


  - Tell students that you will collaborate as a whole group and continue
practicing with the _ar_ words today.


  - Display the Spelling Card for /ar/ > _ar_ ( _car_ ).


  - Ask students to think of a multisyllabic word containing spelling _ar_ as /ar/.

Provide think time, then ask for two student volunteers to share the word
they were thinking. Write the two words on the board, and ask students to
read them in unison, clapping the syllables and emphasizing the _ar_ syllable.


**Note:** If needed, you may provide the words: _cargo_ and _gardening_ .


  - Underline the _ar_ in each word.


  - Ask: What sound does _ar_ represent in these words? ( _/ar/_ )


  - Display the Spelling Card for /er/ > _ar_ ( _dollar_ ). Students will work as a whole
group and follow these steps for saying the _ar_ words.


1. Read the word.


2. Clap the syllables, and emphasize the ‘ar’ syllable.


3. Identify the _ar_ in the word, and one volunteer will come up to underline
the _ar._

 - Underline the _‘ar’_ in each word.


 - Ask: What sound does _‘ar’_ represent in these words? ( _/er/_ )


 - Direct students to look at both pairs of words, and discuss with an elbow
partner about where the _‘ar’_ syllable is in each word. Use the following
Sentence Stems to guide their discussion.


   - The words with /ar/ sound, have spelling _‘ar’_ in the ________ syllable.
( _first_ )


   - The words with /er/ sound, have spelling _‘ar’_ in the ________ syllable.
( _last_ )


 - Point out that when the spelling _‘ar’_ is in the last syllable of a multisyllabic
word it represents the /er/ sound, and when it is found elsewhere in a word, it
represents the /ar/ sound.


**Note:** In a single-syllable word, _‘ar’_ represents the / _ar_ / sound. There may be
some exceptions, but this is a general rule. This can help them figure out the
way to correctly pronounce a word containing _ar_ .


 - Remind students that they can turn to the Individual Code Chart page with
the _ar_ spelling pattern to remember the corresponding sounds.

  - Model decoding and reading the word _library_ (Note: This word is a Tricky
Word from Unit 4). Rather than continuing from that point, re-read the entire
sentence fluently from the beginning.


  - Explain to students that they should restart and reread an entire sentence

to build fluency and ensure comprehension. Pausing to decode unfamiliar
words can disrupt comprehension, so this strategy helps tie the sentence
together smoothly.


  - Move students into small reading groups of three or four to collaborate about
the Reader. Instruct students to take turns reading paragraphs aloud within
their small groups, ending at on page 26.


  - Remind students to practice the fluency skill taught and use the Glossary in
the Reader to discover the pronunciation and definition of words in bold.


  - Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension, as well as to check for

their ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words.
Write at least two prompts on the board for students to discuss within
their groups after they finish reading. Have students listen actively and
ask relevant questions to clarify any information from the text or prompts.
Example prompts include:


1. **Literal:** What did Marcus and Cory learn about how sound waves travel
through the air? ( _Marcus and Cory learned that forces make sound waves_
_travel through the air and enter a person’s ears, making the eardrum vibrate._ )


2. **Literal:** What do Marcus and Cory do to protect their ears at the concert?
( _They protected their ears by ordering headphones._ )


3. **Inferential:** How did Marcus and Cory demonstrate their understanding of
the importance of protecting their ears? ( _They ordered special headphones to_
_prevent damage from loud noises at the concert and sporting event._ )


4. **Evaluative:** Reflecting on the story, why do you think the author included
Marcus and Cory’s conversation about protecting their ears and using the
headphones? ( _To emphasize the importance of protecting your ears and the_
_use of headphones in preserving hearing._ )


  - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses.
Provide students with sentence frames as needed such as:


    - Marcus and Cory learned that...

    - Marcus and Cory protected their ears by...

    - The boys demonstrated their understanding by...

    - I think that the author included their conversation because...

  - Review the game instructions:

    - Explain that there are two types of cards in their bag or container: Alien
Cards and Comet Cards. Each card has a word printed on the other side.

    - To play, Student A draws a card and reads the word on the card aloud to

their partner, without showing their partner the card.

    - Student B writes the word on a piece of paper.

    - Student A reveals the card. If Student B spells the word incorrectly, the
word goes back into the bag or container. If Student B spells the word
correctly on a card with an alien on the back, he or she can take a card
from player A. If player B correctly spells a word on a card with a comet
symbol on the back, he or she gets a second turn.

    - Students switch roles and play continues until all cards have been pulled.

    - When all cards have been pulled or time runs out, students count their
cards. The student with the most cards at the end of the game is the winner!


  - Direct students to write two sentences using two words from the game.


  - Remind students to write words in cursive, leaving space between words.

when an affix is added to the end of a word, it’s called a suffix. The focus of
this lesson is on the meaning and use of the suffix _–y_ .


  - Explain that when _–y_ suffix is added after a noun base word, it turns a noun
into an adjective.


  - Ask students to collaborate with a partner turn and talk: What is a noun? ( _A_
_person, place, thing, or idea, like a shark, a school, a pencil, or freedom._ ) What
is an adjective? ( _A word that describes a noun, like awesome, large, red._ )


  - Display the top of Add Suffix _–y_ . (TR 5.1)


  - Point to the word _cloud_, and ask students to read the word aloud. Point to the
suffix _–y_ . Point to the new word in the third column: _cloudy_ .


  - Direct students to read the new word aloud as you run your finger
underneath it.


  - Ask students to turn and talk: Share a sentence to demonstrate the noun
becoming an adjective with the addition of the suffix. ( _There are lots of clouds_
_in the sky, so it is a cloudy day._ )


  - Repeat with _mess_, _itch_, and _dust_ .


**TEKS 3.1.D** Work collaboratively with others by following agreed-upon rules, norms, and protocols; **TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words; **TEKS 3.3.C** Identify the

Challenge


Invite students to think
of other adjectives with
the _–y_ suffix that could
fit in the story on Activity

to add to the story using
these additional adjectives.
Students can also illustrate
the story, marking related
adjectives ending in _–y_ on
their pictures.




 - Point to _fun_ on Add Suffix _–y_ .


 - Explain that if a word ends with a single vowel followed by a consonant, we
double the final consonant before adding the suffix.


 - Add _funny_ to the third column.


 - Point out that _fun_ ends with the single vowel ‘u’ and the consonant ‘n’. To add
_–y_, the ‘n’ must be doubled. Demonstrate that without doubling the ‘n’ the
word becomes _funy_ and the vowel sound becomes long.


 - Ask students to turn and talk: Share a sentence to demonstrate the noun
becoming an adjective with the addition of the suffix. ( _We were having fun,_
_and something funny happened._ )


 - Repeat with _mom_ and _pup_ .


 - Point to _ice_ on Add Suffix _–y_ .


 - Explain that when words end in silent ‘e’, you drop the ‘e’ before adding the

  - Blend the sounds aloud as you run your fingers under them, then ask

students to repeat the word themselves: /m/ /ie/ /t/. For additional support,
display the Spelling Cards for each sound.


  - Tell students that _might_ is a homonym; it is a word that has multiple
meanings but is spelled and pronounced the same.


  - Display the following sentences. Instruct students to Think-Pair-Share what
_might_ means in each sentence and its part of speech:


    - I tried with all my might to open the pickle jar, but it remained stuck.
( _strength, noun_ )


    - The forecast says it might rain tomorrow. ( _has uncertainty, verb_ )


  - Remind students that readers need to look at the context of the whole

sentence to know which meaning of _might_ is used in that sentence. In
_Adventures of Marcus and Cory_, _might_ is used as a verb to show uncertainty.
On page 3, for example, Cory guesses when he hears a barking dog that it
“might have seen a squirrel.”


  - Pair students with intentional reading partners.


  - Instruct students to work together and partner read Chapter 4, pages 28–33.

their groups after they finish reading. Have students listen actively and
ask relevant questions to clarify any information from the text or prompts.
Example prompts include:


1. **Literal:** What sounds did Cory and Marcus hear as they walked through the
forest? ( _They heard sounds like the crunching of dried leaves under their shoes_
_and the sound of the water in a small stream._ )


2. **Evaluative:** How was the boys’ appearance affected by the weather? ( _They_

Lesson 6 Introduce Suffix _–ous_
**59**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


This lesson and the following lesson focus on three common suffix rules for
adding _–ous_ to a base word that is a noun to create an adjective: adding
_–ous_, changing a final ‘y’ to an ‘i’, and dropping a silent ‘e’. It is noted that
some adjectives end in _–ous_ but do not have a base word (e.g., _enormous_ ).
It should be noted that there are other rules for the suffix _–ous_ which
students will learn in later grades.

- Ask students to turn and talk: Share a sentence to demonstrate the noun
becoming an adjective with the addition of the suffix for the word _dangerous_ .
( _Being near a fire can be very dangerous, yet firefighters face danger every day_
_to help people._ )


- Repeat with _joy, glamor_, and _humor_ .


- Point to and read the next three words: _envy, victory,_ and _mystery_ .


- Prompt students to turn and talk: What do you notice about the spelling or
sound of these words? ( _They each end with a ‘y’._ _The ‘y’ makes the /ee/ sound._ )


- Explain that if a word ends in a ‘y’, and there’s a consonant before the ‘y’, we
change the ‘y’ to an ‘i’ before adding our suffix _–ous_ . But, if the word ends
with a vowel before the ‘y’, like in _joy_, we don’t change the ‘y’ to an ‘i’. We just
add the suffix, like in _joyous_ .


- Demonstrate with _envy_ . Point to the ‘y’, then point to the consonant ‘v’ that
comes before it. This means you change the ‘y’ to an ‘i’ before adding _–ous_ to
make the word _envious_ .


- Ask students to turn and talk: Share a sentence to demonstrate the noun
becoming an adjective with the addition of the suffix for the word _envy_ . ( _If_
_you are full of envy, then you could be described as envious._ )


- Repeat with _victory_ and _mystery_ .


- Show the next three words: _fame, nerve,_ and _adventure_ . Have students
decode the words themselves before saying them aloud.


- Prompt students to turn and talk: What do you notice about the spelling or
sounds in these words? ( _They each end with a silent ‘e’._ )


- Explain that when words end in silent ‘e’, you drop the ‘e’ before adding the
suffix _–ous_ . Remind students that this is the same rule as for adding the
suffix _–y_ .


- Demonstrate with _fame_ . Point to the ‘e’, then the suffix _–ous_ to make the
word _famous_ .


- Ask students to turn and talk: Share a sentence to demonstrate the noun
becoming an adjective with the addition of the suffix with the word _fame_ . ( _He_
_didn’t want to be famous because he didn’t like the attention that fame brought._ )

- Explain that some words have an _–ous_ ending but do not follow these rules,
like cautious for the word _caution_ and _enormous_, which does not have a clear
base word. Students should watch for these types of words as they read
because even in these words, the _–ous_ ending holds the same meaning.

                 - Explain that students will examine another high-frequency word: _light_ .


             - Remind students that they have previously learned the high-frequency words
_might_ and _night_ . Ask: What letters in these words represent the /ie/ sound? ( _igh_ )


                 - Tell students that _light_ is another high-frequency word that is a homonym; it
has multiple meanings but is spelled and pronounced the same.


                 - Instruct students to Think-Pair-Share with a partner the different meanings
and parts of speech for _light_, sharing definitions and sample sentences with
the class. Students should identify that _light_ can be:


                   - a **noun** to mean a natural source of brightness that enhances vision, like
the light from the sun, or an object that makes light, like a traffic light or
Christmas lights;


Foundational Skills 5


  - a **verb** to mean the action of adding a flame or igniting a light source; and

  - an **adjective** to mean not heavy like a light pillow, or something that is
fair-colored like light eyes or skin. There are additional meanings and
uses as well.


- Remind students that readers need to look at the context of the whole
sentence to know which meaning of _light_ is used in that sentence. In
_Adventures of Marcus and Cory_, light is often used when talking about light
and dark, vision, things that create light, and color.


- Tell students that the word _light_ appears twenty-one times in today’s section
of the Reader as Marcus and Cory learn about the importance of light in
daily life, and then many more times in future chapters. Many times, light is
described with an adjective ending in the _–ous_ suffix.


- List on the board the three words from the chapter that end in the _–ous_
suffix: _dangerous, glorious, cautious._


- Explain that the base word for _cautious_ is _caution_ . Remind students that
_cautions_ is one of those words that doesn’t follow any of the _–ous_ rules.


- Prompt students to turn and talk: what is the base word of the two first
words, _dangerous_ and _glorious_ ? ( _danger, glory_ )


- Focus the class on the first two sentences on page 34 of the Reader.


- Explain that you will read the sentences aloud, pausing occasionally before a
word. The class will follow along and say the next word aloud when they hear
the teacher pause.


- Remind students that they will need to stay focused and engaged to know
when it’s their turn to fill in the pause with the next word of the text.


- Model fluent reading, using appropriate rate, expression, and pausing for
punctuation. Pause at random spots to allow students to read the next word
aloud as a class.


- Pair students with intentional reading partners by using past observations
and assessments to guide pairings.


- Instruct students to partner read the assigned section of the Reader, pages
34–38.


- Direct reading partners to alternate paragraphs, pausing occasionally
without warning. When their partner hears them pause, the partner reads the
next word aloud and the first reader continues until the end of the paragraph.

~~**INTRODUCE SUFFIX –LY (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that in previous lessons, they reviewed the suffixes _–y_ and
_–ous,_ which change a noun into an adjective.


  - Explain that, today, they will be learning about another suffix’s meaning and
use: _–ly._


  - Direct students to turn and talk: What is the difference between nouns,
adjectives, and adverbs? ( _A noun is a person, place, thing, or idea. An_
_adjective is a word that describes a noun or a pronoun. An adverb is a word_
_that describes a verb, or an action. Adverbs give more information about how_
_something is done._ )


  - Direct students to Add Suffix _–ly_ while you display the digital version.
Distribute copies of TR 8.1 to students and display Digital Component 8.1.


  - Focus students’ attention on the first five words in the first column: _hopeful,_
_quiet, silent, famous, sharp._


  - Ask: What part of speech are these words? ( _Adjectives_ )


  - Explain that when we add _–ly_ to a base word that is an adjective, the word
changes into an adverb.


  - Point to the word _hopeful,_ and ask students to read it aloud. Point to the
suffix _–ly_ . Write the new word in the third column: _hopefully_ .


  - Ask students to read the new word aloud as you run your finger underneath it.


  - Put each word in a sentence to demonstrate the difference between the use
of the adjective _hopeful_ and the use of the adverb _hopefully_ : _I am hopeful that_
_it will rain. It will hopefully rain today_ .


  - Direct students to Think-Pair-Share: Create your own sentences that
demonstrate the difference between the use of the adjective _hopeful_ and the
use of the adverb _hopefully_ .

- Have students come up and decode by adding a suffix to these words to
apply their knowledge of suffixes with _quiet, silent,_ and _famous_ .


- Point to the next four words on Add Suffix _–ly_ : _sleepy, easy, lucky, funny._


- Ask: What part of speech are these words? ( _Adjectives_ )


- Direct students to Think-Pair-Share: How is the spelling or sound of these
words similar? ( _They each end with a ‘y’. The ‘y’ makes the /ee/ sound._ )


- Explain that if an adjective ends in a ‘y’, and there’s a consonant before the
‘y’, we change the ‘y’ to an ‘i’ before adding our suffix _–ly._ Point out that this is
the same rule as with adding the suffix _–ous_ to a word ending in ‘y’.


- Demonstrate with _sleepy_ . Point to the word and ask students to read it aloud.
Point to the ‘y’ and remind students that this changes to an ‘i’ before adding
the suffix _–ly_ . Write the new word in the third column: _sleepily._


- Ask students to chorally read the new word aloud as you run your finger

  - Play Suffix Connect using the Suffix _–ly_ Connect Cards and Suffix _–ly_
Connect Clues provided in the Additional Support materials section of the
Teacher Resources. Distribute the Connect cards and tokens used for game
pieces.


    - Explain that students will play Suffix Connect, listening to clues about
word meanings and then marking the space of the word that answers the
clue. Note that many of the words in the game are ones they encountered
in Chapter 7 of their Reader.


    - Demonstrate how the game works by drawing the top card from the word
stack and reading the clue aloud while students check their game boards
for the word that answers the clue. Show students how to place a token
on top of the word on the board as it is called out.


    - After students have placed their markers, call on a student to say the
correct answer so that students can check their boards.


    - Show students how to get an official “Connect” by getting four in a row
in any direction (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally). The game is
finished when one card is covered with tokens and a student says “Suffix
Connect!”


    - Before beginning, allow students a minute to read the words that are on
their cards to prepare for possible answers to the clues they will hear.


  - Use props or other visual supports to help students understand and practice
using the suffix _–ly_ . For example, provide each student with a stuffed animal.
Narrate for them how to move the stuffed animal: “Put your animal to sleep.
Now, have them _sleepily_ wake up. Next, have them excitedly greet a friend.”
Encourage students to provide a voice for their animals as applicable. For
example, if prompting them to have their animals do an activity _curiously_,
have students offer statements to illustrate this attitude in their animal: “I
wonder about ___” or “Hm, why does ___?” Play with different imaginative
settings, like going to the zoo or to a restaurant. Have students call out other

  - _ly_ words their animals might exhibit.


  - Play the movement game Cross the Room. Line students up on one side of
the room. One at a time, call on them, and have them ask for a number of

steps they can take (between one and five). For example, a student might
ask, “Can I cross the room in three steps?” Grant permission by saying, “Yes,
you can take three steps quietly,” inserting different – _ly_ words each time
( _happily, sadly, slowly, bravely, calmly, energetically,_ etc.). Then have the
student actually take the number of steps while exhibiting the descriptor
with their bodies. If students are ready, have them provide the descriptors
for their movement. For example, a student might ask, “Can I cross the room
_quickly_ in three steps?” Embodied movement games like this one can be
particularly useful in supporting student learning.

~~**INTRODUCE THE SUFFIX –IVE (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Explain to the class that they will be learning about another suffix, _–ive._


  - Ask students: What suffixes have we learned about so far in this unit? ( _The_
_suffix_ –y, _which changes a noun into an adjective; the suffix –_ ous _which also_
_turns a noun into an adjective; the suffix –_ ly _which turns the base word to an_
_adverb or adjective._ )


  - Display Add Suffix _–ive_ . Distribute copies of TR 10.1 to students and display
Digital Component 10.1.


  - Point out the first word in the chart, _reflect_ . Have students decode the word
themselves before saying it aloud. Model adding the suffix _–ive_ to make
the word _reflective_ . Write the word in the right-hand column in cursive,
demonstrating proper letter formation.


  - Direct students to Think-Pair-Share: What part of speech is the base word of
reflective? ( _The word is a verb._ ) What part of speech is the new word? ( _The_
_word is an adjective._ )


  - Explain to students that when _–ive_ is added to a base word that is a verb, it
often changes the verb into an adjective.


  - Ask students to turn and talk: Share two sentences to demonstrate the verb
becoming an adjective with the addition of the suffix. ( _The mirror can reflect_
_our dances. My grandmother was reflective about our trip as a family and_
_happy that we did it together._ )


  - Have students turn and practice with a partner on their whiteboard using the
words _support_ and _protect_ .

their own story using these
words. Invite them to swap
with a partner to complete.


**106**




- Ask: How are the spellings of these words similar? ( _They each end in a silent_
_‘e’._ )


- Explain that if a verb ends in a silent ‘e’, the ‘e’ is dropped to add the _–ive_
suffix. Remind students that this is the same rule as with adding the _–y_ suffix
and the _–ous_ suffix.


- Demonstrate with _create_ . Point to the word, and ask students to read it aloud.
Point to the ‘e’, and remind students that the ‘e’ must drop before adding the
suffix _–ive_ . Write the new word in the third column: _creative_ .


- Have students write the word create with _–ive_ on their whiteboard to make
the word _creative_ .


- Ask students to turn and talk: Share two sentences to demonstrate the noun
becoming an adjective with the addition of the suffix. ( _I love to create artwork_
_for my mom. My brother is very creative._ )


- Have students practice on their whiteboard using the words _investigate_ and
_initiate_ . After writing the words with _–ive_, have them share with a partner.


- Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share: What does _initiative_ mean? ( _Initiative_
_is the ability to get things started or the motivation to take charge._ ) How does
the word _initiative_ differ from the other words in the chart? (Initiative _is a_
_noun, and the previous new_ –ive _words are all verbs._ )


- Explain that sometimes the _–ive_ suffix can create new nouns rather than
verbs when it is added to certain base words.


- Point to the word _detect_, and ask students to read the word aloud. Point to
the suffix _–ive_ . Write the new word in the third column: _detective_ .


- Ask: What part of speech is _detective_ ? _(The word is a noun.)_


- Ask students to turn and talk: Share two sentences to demonstrate the noun
becoming an adjective with the addition of the suffix. ( _Does the dog detect a_
_scent? The detective solved the case._ )


- Have students practice on their whiteboard using the words _object, narrate,_
and _relate_ .


- Point out to students that some words ending in _–ive_ can be both adjectives
and nouns, such as _objective, narrative,_ and _relative_ .


- Also, explain that some words have an _–ive_ ending but do not exactly follow
the same spelling rules as the previous examples. For example, both _imagine_
and _represent_ become _imaginative_ and _representative_ . In these cases, _–ative_
must be added. Students should watch for these types of words as they
read because even in these words, the _–ive_ ending still can make a word an
adjective, a noun, or both.

    - Tricky Word: _figure_


       - Expected: /f/, /i/, /g/


       - Tricky spelling: The letters ‘ _ure_ ’ are pronounced / _yer_ /.


  - Underline the letters _ure_ in _figure_, and say the word again, stretching out the
second syllable. Ask students whether they hear these letters make the / _yer_ /
sound or the / _er_ / sound.


  - List on the board the nine words from the chapter that end in the _–ive_ suffix:
_impressive, reflective, effective, responsive, active, investigative, creative,_
_comprehensive, adaptive._


  - Guide the class in reading Chapter 9: “Night Vision.” Model fluent reading
for a sentence or two, using appropriate rate, expression, and pausing for
punctuation.


  - Pair students with intentional reading partners.


  - Instruct students to partner read the assigned section of the Reader, pages
64–68


  - Model partner reading with a student volunteer, alternating reading
sentences and providing assistance to each other as needed.


  - Direct reading partners to alternate reading paragraphs and focus on being
expressive as they read the characters’ lines in any dialogue. When reading
the story, remind students to speak at an appropriate rate and volume.


  - As you listen to students read, make notes regarding their individual reading
ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record. Record notes about mispronunciations,
self-correction, pacing, transposition of words, and expression.


  - Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension, as well as to check for
their ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words.
Have students listen actively and ask relevant questions to clarify any
information from the text or prompts. Example prompts include:


1. **Literal:** What key details from the text support the idea that nocturnal animals
are able to see well at night? ( _Owls have impressive night vision with a reflective_
_layer on the eye; their eyes are responsive, so they can see when it is dark._ )


2. **Inferential:** Based on what you have read in this chapter, what can you infer
about Marcus and Cory? ( _They continue to be curious about everything_
_because now they are investigating night vision, they enjoy being outdoors_
_because they have now found another thing to investigate outside, etc._ )

3. **Evaluative:** What details from the text support the idea that Marcus and
Cory are inquisitive about the world around them? ( _They did a comprehensive_
_search about night-vision goggles; they went to the library to learn about_
_technology; they went on a hike at night to learn about seeing in the dark._ )


  - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses.
Provide students with sentence frames as needed such as:

~~**MORE HELP WITH THE SUFFIX –IVE**~~


  - Many _–ive_ words in this lesson are three or more syllables. If students need
more support with these words, provide additional practice with manipulatives.
Chunk base words such as _investigate, create_, and _initiate_ by their syllables on
notecards, and provide cards with _–ive_ written on them. Have students put the
cards in the correct order as you say the word aloud a few times. Then, have
them practice saying each syllable in isolation before putting them together
into the entire base word. Spend time discussing the definition of the word,
including examples, as well as the word’s part of speech. Then, have students
add the _–ive_ card to the base word. Again, have them practice pronunciation,
and discuss the new word’s meaning and the new word’s part of speech.


  - Have students practice with _–ive_ word definitions. Ask, Who or what is
_creative_ ? Who or what is _impressive_ ? Who or what is _expressive_ ? Give
students an opportunity to record their ideas before facilitating discussion.
Ask: How do you know they are _creative_ ? What does that word _mean_ ?

/w/ /or/ /m/ is the correct pronunciation, and blend the sounds aloud as you
run your fingers under them, then ask students to repeat the word themselves.


- Remind students that _warm_ is a word with multiple meanings. Read aloud
the sentences from _Adventures of Marcus and Cory_ that used the word _warm,_
and ask students to define the word based on its use:

  - “The sound was a _warm_, rich melody that made everyone stop and listen” (p. 8).

  - “Cory nodded, pushing his hands deep in his pockets to stay _warm_ ” (p. 30).

  - “Cory nodded, the flashlight in his hand casting a _warm_ glow on his face”
(p. 77).


- Display the Tricky Word, read it aloud, and use it in a sentence:


  - _silhouettes_


- Point out which parts of the word are regular and can be blended as you
would expect and which parts are not regular and will either be taught later
or simply must be remembered.


  - Tricky Word: _silhouettes_


    - Expected: /s/, /i/, /l/, /e/, /t/, /s/


   - Tricky Spelling: The letters hou are pronounced / /+/w/.


- Focus students on Chapter 10, “Fun with Flashlights and Shadows,” on page 70.


- Begin reading the first sentence, and pause before you get to the word
inventive. Point it out as a word you are unsure how to pronounce.


- Model decoding and reading _inventive_ . Rather than continuing from that
point, reread the entire sentence fluently from the beginning.


- Explain to students that they should restart and reread an entire sentence
to build fluency and ensure comprehension. Pausing to decode unfamiliar
words can disrupt comprehension, so this strategy helps tie the sentence
together smoothly.


- Direct students to read Chapter 10 quietly aloud to themselves, ending on
page 77.


- Move students to designated areas around the classroom where they can
read aloud to themselves without disturbing their peers.


- Remind students to use the Glossary in the Reader to discover the

**Primary Focus:** Students will read and spell words that follow a VCCCV
syllable division pattern with accent shifts.

~~**[ TEKS 3.1.B; TEKS 3.2.A.iv; TEKS 3.2.B.v; TEKS 3.2.D ]**~~


~~**REVIEW VCCCV WORDS WITH ACCENT SHIFTS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students to turn and talk about what they learned in the previous lesson
about how to segment and read VCCCV words. Have students share answers
aloud with the class. ( _Students may share that in some words, the division_
_happens after the first consonant [VC/CCV]. In other words, the division_
_happens after the second consonant [VCC/CV].)_


  - Write _VCCCV_ on the board. Show the anchor chart from the previous lesson
with the six steps. Have students restate the steps for breaking down a

VCCCV word.


  - Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share: How do we know how the three
consonants should be divided? ( _We divide them in a way that keeps digraphs_
_or blends together._ )


  - Distribute a whiteboard and dry erase marker to each student.


  - Write the word _inspect_ on the board in cursive, modeling proper letter
formation. Direct students to write the word on their whiteboards in cursive.


  - Tell students to follow the steps learned in the previous lesson and written on
the anchor chart.


  - Tell students to divide the syllables, read the word, and clap the syllables. ( _in/_
_spect_ )


  - Determine if the word is VC/CCV or VCC/CV. ( _VCC/CV_ )


  - Circulate and monitor to check for correct labeling of VC/CCV or VCC/CV.


**TEKS 3.1.B** Follow, restate, and give oral instructions that involve a series of related sequences of actions; **TEKS 3.2.A.iv**
Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words using knowledge of syllable division patterns such as VCCV,
VCV, and VCCCV with accent shifts; **TEKS 3.2.B.v** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by spelling words using knowledge of syllable division patterns such as VCCV, VCV, and VCCCV; **TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers
legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.

**126**




- Remind students about the Accented Syllables document (TR 12.1) available
to use as a helpful reference.


- Return to the board, marking the word correctly and guiding students to
compare the information on their whiteboards to the information on the
board. ( _VC/CCV_ ) Answer any clarifying questions.


- Ask students to say the word in unison, listening for the syllable that is
accented. Students should clap as they say the unaccented syllable ( _in_ ) and
snap as they say the accented syllable ( _spect_ ).


- Write the word _attribute_ on the board in cursive, modeling the proper letter
formation. Have students decode the word themselves before reading it aloud.


- Ask: What vowels and consonants make up the VCCCV pattern in _attribute_ ?
( _attri_ )


- Label the VCCCV pattern in _attribute_ .


- Prompt students to turn and talk to their partner: Which letters form a blend
or digraph? ( _The letters ‘tr’ form a blend._ )


- Underline the ‘tr’.


- Prompt students to turn and talk: Where should I draw the lines in _attribute_
to indicate the syllable division? ( _at/trib/ute_ )


- Explain that this word can be pronounced two ways, with the accent or stress
on the first syllable or the second syllable. This makes the word change its
meaning. When the first syllable is accented, this word is a noun. When the
second syllable is accented, this word is a verb.


- Write _attribute_ on the board two more times, underlining the first syllable ( _at_ )
in one and the second syllable ( _trib_ ) in the other.


- Ask students to say each word in unison as you point to it, clapping as they say
the accented syllable and snapping as they say the two unaccented syllables.


- Explain that some VCCCV patterned words can have different meanings
when the accent shifts. You can tell which syllable is stressed because it is
longer and louder than the other syllables. It is helpful to recognize these
shifts when pronouncing and spelling words.


- Point to and read the word _AT-tribute_ . Reiterate that the pronunciation with
stress on the first syllable is a noun; an _attribute_ is a quality or feature of
something. Provide students with an example: Kindness is one of her best
attributes.


Foundational Skills 5


  - Point to and read the word _at-TRIB-ute_ . Reiterate that the pronunciation with
stress on the second syllable is a verb. When you _attribute_ something to
someone or something, you are saying that they are the source or cause of
it. Provide students with an example: Mom _attributes_ her beautiful garden to
watering the flowers every day.


  - Write the word _increase_ on the board in cursive, modeling proper letter
formation. Direct students to write the word on their whiteboards in cursive.


  - Have students work through the process they have learned.


    - Identify and label the VCCCV letters. Write a V under ‘i’ and ‘e’. Write a C
under ‘n’, ‘c’, and ‘r’.


    - Determine the digraph or blend. _(The letters cr form a blend.)_

    - Tell students to divide the syllables, read the word, and clap the syllables.
( _in/crease_ )


    - Determine if the word is VC/CCV or VCC/CV. ( _VC/CCV_ )


  - Circulate and monitor to check for correct labeling of VC/CCV or VCC/CV.
Remind students about the Accented Syllables document (TR 12.1) available
for students to reference to help.


  - Return to the board, marking the word correctly and guiding students to
compare the information on their whiteboards to the information on the
board. Answer any clarifying questions.


  - Write _increase_ on the board two more times. Explain that _increase_ is
another VCCCV patterned word that can have different meanings when the
accent shifts.


  - Underline the first syllable ( _in_ ) in one and the second syllable ( _crease_ ) in the
other.


  - Ask students to say each word in unison as you point to it, clapping as they
say the accented syllable and snapping as they say the unaccented syllable.


  - Write two sentences on the board.


    - The increase in temperature made it a perfect day for swimming.

    - If you water the plants regularly, they will increase in size.


  - Move students into pairs. Tell students that one partner should read the first
sentence and the other partner should read the second sentence. While
the partner is reading the sentence, the other partner should listen to how
_increase_ is naturally said by the other partner to determine the stressed and
unstressed syllables.

 - Invite students to share their findings. Provide sentence frames:


   - “In the first sentence, the . . . syllable of . . . is the accented syllable.”

   - “In the second sentence, the . . . syllable of . . . is the accented syllable.”

   - “When . . . is used as a noun, the accent is on the . . . syllable.”

   - “When . . . is used as a verb, the accent is on the . . . syllable.”


 - Confirm that the first sentence uses _increase_ as a noun and the accent is on
the first syllable. The second sentence uses _increase_ as a verb and the accent
is on the second syllable.


 - Remind students that they can tell which syllable is stressed because it is
longer and louder than the other syllables.


~~**PRACTICE WITH READING AND DICTATION (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students open to Activity Page 12.1.


 - Present instructions for 1–2 and 3–5. Then, have students complete those
sections.


   - 1–2: Read the VCCCV words, and draw a slash to segment the syllables.

   - 3–5: Identify the VCCCV word in each sentence, segment the syllables by
drawing a slash, and then circle the accented syllable.


 - Present instructions for 6–7.


   - 6–7: Listen as the teacher dictates the VCCCV words: _contract_ and
_incline_ . Draw a slash to segment the syllables, and circle the accented

                 - Display the Tricky Word, read it aloud, and use it in a sentence:


                   - _carousel_


             - Point out which parts of the word are regular and can be blended as you
would expect and which parts are not regular and will either be taught later
or simply must be remembered.


                   - Tricky Word: _carousel_


                         - Expected: /k/, /s/, /e/, /l/

                 - Begin reading the first sentence, and pause before you get to the word


Foundational Skills 5


_adventure_ . Point it out as a word you are unsure how to pronounce.


  - Note: This was introduced as a Tricky Word in Unit 4.


  - Model decoding and reading _amusement_ . Rather than continuing from that
point, reread the entire sentence fluently from the beginning.


  - Explain to students that they should restart and reread an entire sentence
to build fluency and ensure comprehension. Pausing to decode unfamiliar
words can disrupt comprehension. Going back to the beginning of the
sentence and rereading with the decoded word helps tie the sentence
together smoothly and provide clarity about what is being read.


  - Move students into intentional reading partners.


  - Direct reading partners to read a section of Chapter 11, pages 78–82.


  - Remind reading partners to alternate paragraphs as they read aloud to their
partner.


  - Choose strategic prompts to check for comprehension, as well as to check
for their ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words.
Have students listen actively and ask relevant questions to clarify any
information from the text or prompts. Example prompts include:


1. **Literal:** How do you think the setting of the amusement park helps Marcus
and Cory learn more about sounds? ( _The boys heard the engines on the_
_rides, the clinking of the rings against the bottles in the game booth, and scary_
_sounds in the haunted house._ )


2. **Inferential:** What is the most likely reason the boys have different feelings
about the noises in the park? ( _The boys found the noises in the park_
_entertaining but also too loud at times. They might have felt this way because_
_excessive noise can be overwhelming and sometimes unpleasant._ )


3. **Evaluative:** What details from the text support the idea that the game
booth was an enjoyable place to be? ( _Answers may vary, but students can_
_reference the peaceful ambiance, the explanation of the game rules, and_
_the cozy bubble away from the rest of the park as reasons Marcus and Cory_
_enjoyed the game booth._ )


  - Ensure students draw evidence from the text to support their responses.
Provide sentence stems as needed such as:


    - I think the setting of the amusement park helped the boys learn more
about sounds because...


    - It is most likely that they have different feelings about noises in the park
because...

_en_ . Explain that, otherwise, _‘ee’_ in _whiteen_ would make the /ee/ sound.


- Direct the students’ attention to the words _brighten_ and _tighten_ . Point out
that both words have the _-ight_ spelling pattern. Remind them that when
they segment VCCCV words, they should segment syllables so that groups
of letters go together. In these words, the ‘g’, ‘h’, and ‘t’ are part of a single
spelling pattern; therefore, they would be grouped when segmenting the
syllables (VCCC/V). The same approach would apply to words like _frighten_ or
_heighten_ .


Foundational Skills 5


~~**PRACTICE WITH MIX AND MATCH REVIEW (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students open to Activity Page 13.1 and follow the directions.


 - Move students into small groups to collaborate on Activity Page 13.1. Provide
each group with a set of Mix and Match Suffix Word Cards. (TR 13.1) Ensure
each group has access to a print or online dictionary.


 - Explain that groups will start with a base word and add the different affixes
to form adjectives or adverbs. Groups will use a print or online dictionary to
check that they have formed an adjective or adverb, then record the word in
the correct table on Activity Page 13.1.


 - Model the process with the base word _create_ . Demonstrate how to move the
cards around to form _creative_ .


 - Release groups to begin.


 - Instruct groups to use their dictionaries to record a definition of any two
adjectives or adverbs of their choosing.


Check for Understanding


As students complete the Mix and Match chart, circulate and observe their ability to

create and use words with the suffixes. Provide support as necessary.

  - Inform students that before reading, they will practice a few words from the
text. Write the words _bright, soft, quick, sweet, wide,_ and _strength_ on the board.


  - Remind students that adding _–en_ to a word changes its meaning. Have
students add suffix _–en_ to these words and read them together. ( _brighten,_
_quicken, soften, sweeten, widen, and strengthen_ )


  - Explain that in the passage, some of these words are used in the past tense
by adding _–ed_ . For example, _quicken_ becomes _quickened_ .


  - Focus students on page 83, starting at “This is the best. . .”


  - Read aloud the sentence on page 83. Point out the exclamation point. Read it
aloud once with excitement and once without excitement.


  - Ask: Which version of my reading matches what the author intended by
including an exclamation point? ( _The version with excitement._ )


  - Prompt students to turn and talk: What is the most likely reason the
characters are speaking with such excitement in this part of the text? ( _They_
_are having fun at an amusement park._ )


  - Move students into intentional reading partners. Remind them to read aloud
lines that end with an exclamation point with excitement.


  - Direct students to read aloud the next section of the Reader with their
reading partner, ending on page 89. When reading the story, remind students
to speak at an appropriate rate and volume.


  - Instruct partners to give a thumbs up each time they see a word in the
text with the _–en_ suffix. Watch for students to give a thumbs up for each
of these words: _brightened, quickened, softened, sweetened, widened, and_
_strengthened_ . Pay attention to when you see the _–en_ suffix and how these
words are describing something.


  - Use strategic prompts to check for comprehension, as well as to check for
their ability to use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words.
Example prompts include:

Lesson 14 Fluency Assessment
**145**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today, the students will begin the multi-part Assessment. In the first part,
you will work one-on-one with students to complete the Fluency Assessment.
Students will engage in a review activity while awaiting their turn for the
assessment. Remind students to use a whisper voice, since testing will be
taking place concurrently with other activities.


You will most likely need more than one day to test each student; you may plan
on using time during the following lesson to complete the Fluency Assessment.


The second part of the assessment takes place in the next lesson. It is a
reading and spelling exercise targeting each of the skills taught in Unit 5.


**Foundational Skills**

                - Predetermine partners to play Moon Shot.


                      - Gather the Moon Shot Game Board, Good to Go! Cards, and Oh No! Cards
from Unit 5, Lesson 2. As needed, make new copies of these materials to
ensure one set per student group.


                 - Provide some small tokens as playing pieces.


**Reading**

                 - Gather books of varying complexity for students to choose from during selfsustained reading time.


                      - Provide students with their own copy of the Self-Sustained Reading Tracker
(TR 15.1) to keep track of their reading progress during independent reading time.


**Universal Access**

                      - Display and briefly review the spelling patterns that were targeted in Unit 5 to
support students’ decoding abilities.


                      - During the Moon Shot game, consider pairing students with varying reading
levels to provide opportunities for them to hear the words their peers model
correctly.


                 - Prepare to provide students with a list of the Unit 5 high-frequency words
including _those_, _close_, _thought_, _something_, _stop_, _got_, _might_, _night_, _light_,
_white_, and _warm_ .


                  - Prepare audio books for students to listen to while following along with the text.


                 - Prepare a graphic organizer for students to complete to help them break

down unfamiliar words they have read, including the definition, an example of
the word’s usage, and an illustration to enhance understanding.


Foundational Skills 5

~~**UNIT 5 FLUENCY ASSESSMENT**~~


You will work individually with each student and take a running record
of the student’s oral reading of a text. For this assessment, you will take
a simple, easily calculated measure of the student’s fluency by seeing
how long it takes the student to read the text. Allow each student three
minutes to read the story. Students with proficient fluency should be able to
complete the text in this amount of time. Instruct students to complete the
comprehension questions after reading the text.


 - Have one student at a time come to a quiet assessment area to read _“_ The
Carnival _”_ with you.


 - Ask the student for Activity Page 14.2 (Fluency Assessment) and Activity
Page 14.3 (Fluency Assessment Questions).


 - Tell the student that you are going to ask him or her to read the story aloud. Before
reading aloud, remind students to speak at an appropriate rate and volume.


 - Explain that you are going to use a watch to see how long it takes them to

read the story. Tell the student that this is not a race; they should read at
their regular pace and not rush.


 - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the title. If you are

using a watch, write the exact Start Time, in minutes and seconds, on your
record page.


 - If you are using a stopwatch, you do not need to write down the start time

since the stopwatch will calculate Elapsed Time.


 - As the student reads the story, make a running record on the copy with the

student’s name using the following guidelines:

Challenge


Encourage students to
reread the passage focusing

on improving expression

and prosody.




- When the student finishes reading the story, write the exact Finish Time in
minutes and seconds on your record sheet.


- Alternatively, if you are using a stopwatch, simply write down the Elapsed
Time in minutes and seconds.


- If the student reads very slowly, you may need to stop the reading before the

student gets to the end of the story. If the student does not read to the end,
draw a vertical line on the record sheet to indicate how far the student read.
Also write down either the Finish Time or the Elapsed Time.


- Direct the student to read and select the correct answer for each question on
Activity Page 14.3. Encourage them to reference the text as they respond.


- Repeat this process for additional students.


Activity Page 14.3: Fluency Assessment


- If the reading was fairly accurate (<10 uncorrected errors), you can get a
rough (and easy) estimate of a student’s W.C.P.M. score simply by noting the
time and looking at the chart on the Unit 5 W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


- To calculate a student’s exact W.C.P.M. score, follow these steps:


  - First, complete the Words section of the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


  - Count Words Read. This is the total number of words that the student

read or attempted to read, up to the point where they stopped. It includes
words that the student read correctly as well as words that the student
read incorrectly or skipped over. If the student attempted to read the
whole story, including the title, use 292 words as your total. If the student
did not finish the story, you will need to count the number of words that
the student actually attempted to read. Write the count for Words Read in
the matching box on the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


  - Count the Uncorrected Mistakes noted in your running record. This

includes words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and words that
you had to supply. Write the total in the box labeled Uncorrected Mistakes.
(A mistake that is corrected by the student is not counted as a mistake;
the student is penalized for the time he or she lost making the correction,
but not for the initial mistake.)


  - Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get Words Correct.


  - Next, complete the Time section of the activity page.



Foundational Skills 5
**150**


  - Calculate Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a stopwatch,

this should already be done for you. Skip to the next step.) If you used a
watch and recorded start and stop times, you will need to subtract the
Start Time from the Finish Time to calculate the Elapsed Time. Subtract
seconds from seconds then minutes from minutes. Calculate Time in
Seconds. Multiply the number of minutes by 60 to convert minutes to
seconds, and then add the number of seconds.


  - Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then multiply by 60 to get

Words Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.).


- As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider:


  - It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.
scores. However, a major goal for Grade 3 students is to read with
sufficient fluency to ensure comprehension and independent reading of
school assignments in subsequent grades. Exact fluency targets vary from
state to state; the national mean calculated by Hasbrouck and Tindal in
2017 for Winter of Grade 3 is 97 W.C.P.M.


  - A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared with the score of other

students in the classroom (or grade level) and also with the national
fluency norms for Winter of Grade 3 obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal.
Students whose scores are below the 25th percentile (79 W.C.P.M) are
experiencing serious problems in reading fluently.


- Compare the student’s W.C.P.M. score to national norms for Winter of Grade
3 (Hasbrouck and Tindal, 2017):







|Reading Time for this<br>Text|W.C.P.M|National Percentiles for<br>Winter, Grade 3|
|---|---|---|
|2:35|141|90th|
|3:05|137|75th|
|4:05|97|50th|
|5:55|79|25th|
|8:00|62|10th|



  - After you have entered each student’s scores on the Unit 5 W.C.P.M

Calculation Sheet (TR 14.5), record them on the Grade 3 End-of-Year
Summary for each student.

Lesson 15 Reading & Spelling Assessment
**153**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today pass out the multi-part Unit 5 Assessment. The reading and spelling
portion of the Assessment takes place during the first 20 minutes of this
lesson. Once students have completed the assessment, they will have time
for quiet recreational reading. Use time in this lesson to finish working with
students who did not complete the Fluency Assessment in the previous lesson.


You may also use Pausing Point days to administer the optional Tricky Word
Assessment included in Teacher Resources to specific students that you
suspect may not have thoroughly mastered the Tricky Words and highfrequency words reviewed in this unit.


**Foundational Skills**

                 - Provide colored pencils for students to use when checking and correcting
their spelling on Activity Page 15.2.


                      - As needed, prepare a copy of the optional Unit 5 Tricky Word Assessment and
the Unit 5 Tricky Word Assessment Analysis.


**Reading**

                 - Consider preparing games used in previous lessons in this unit for review to
be available as an optional activity after assessments.


                 - Gather books of varying complexity for students to choose from during SelfSustained Reading time.


                      - Prepare the Self-Sustained Reading Tracker (TR 15.1) for students to record
their progress as they read independently.


**Universal Access**

                      - Prepare sentence stems to provide to students:


                        - I think the story will be about __ because __.

                        - This character’s situation reminds me of __ because __.

                        - When analyzing [character’s name], I notice that __, which makes me

think __.


                 - Allow students with dysgraphia and other handwriting challenges to use
letter tiles or type to spell words.


                      - To gain additional information about students’ mastery of unit skills, provide

targeted practice to accelerate learning where errors occurred during the
Reading Assessment. Place Activity Page 15.1 in front of the student. Have
the student read the line(s) that contained the error. Then ask the student


Foundational Skills 5
**154**


to point and read the correct word for that line. The student’s oral response
will indicate whether the mistake was a careless error or if the student
needs additional instruction in specific letter-sound correspondences. If
the student makes more than six uncorrected mistakes, they are having
problems with word recognition and may need more practice decoding
specific spellings. Utilize the Pausing Point to provide customized support for
these students.


- Invite students to craft an additional ending to one of their texts. Encourage

them to use multisyllabic words containing affixes and the sound-spelling
pattern _–en_ covered in this unit as they write.

 - Direct students’ attention to the lines at the bottom of the activity page. Tell

students to write the sentence: _Darken the room before the surprise party._
Slowly repeat the sentence twice.


 - At the end, reread each spelling word and the sentence once more.


 - After you have called out all the words, tell students you will now show them
the correct spelling for each word so they may correct their own work.


 - Say and write each word, instructing students to correct their work by
crossing out any incorrect spelling with colored pencils, then copying and
writing the correct spelling next to it.


 - Continue through all the words and then onto the sentence. Remind students
of the importance of correcting their work and learning from any mistakes.

**Moon Shot**

 - Move students into pairs. Provide each pair with a Moon Shot Game Board,

Oh No! Cards, and Good to Go! Cards. Provide each student with a set of
Moon Shot Word Cards that can be found at the end of the Pause Point.
Provide small tokens as playing pieces.


 - Explain that in this game of Moon Shot, the words they will be reading all
have r-controlled syllables with one of the spellings they have been focusing
on: _er_, _ir_, _ur_, _ar_, and _or_ .


 - Review the game instructions:


   - Students take turns drawing word cards.

   - If a student reads the word correctly, he or she can draw a Good to Go!

card and follow the directions on the card.


   - If a student does not read the word correctly, he or she will draw a card

from the Oh No! pile and follow the directions on that card.


   - The first student to make it to the moon is the winner!


**Roll, Flip, Read, Write**

 - Move students into pairs. Provide each pair with a die. Provide each student

with their own set of Roll, Flip, Read, Write Word Cards numbered 1–12 on the
back of the Roll Flip Read Write Cards can be found at the end of the Pausing
Point.


 - Review the game directions:


   - Have students lay their cards face down on the table or floor in front of

them, careful to keep their cards separate from their partner’s cards.


   - To play, have Student A roll the die and then pick up the card that

corresponds to the number rolled and read the word on the card aloud to
their partner, without showing their partner the card.


   - Student B writes the word in the corresponding column on Activity

Page PP.1. Instruct students to sort the card based on the sound the ‘ar’
spelling represents, regardless of any other r-controlled syllables present
in the word.


   - Student A reveals the card and Student B corrects their word placement

or spelling, as needed.


   - Play continues until all words have been revealed. Encourage students

to discuss and justify their reason for writing the word in the chosen
column.

**Accented Syllable Concentration**

 - Provide students with a set of Accented Syllable Concentration cards located
at the end of this Pausing Point.


 - Shuffle the cards and lay them face down on the table, so there are four rows
of four cards each.



Foundational Skills 5
**160**


 - Have students turn over two cards at a time, aiming to find a match. A match
occurs when the bolded words on two cards share the same accented
syllable. For instance, _robot_ and _cabinet_ match because their first syllables
are accented, while _robot_ and _detect_ do not match.


**Note:** Words are bolded and placed in context because sometimes the
accented syllable changes depending on the sentence context (e.g., the word
_present_ ). This additional context engages students and adds complexity to
the task.


 - If a student finds a match, he or she may keep the cards so long as he or she
has read the words correctly.


 - Let the game continue until all matches have been found. The person or
team with the most cards is the winner.


~~**MORE HELP WITH SUFFIXES**~~


**Crossword Puzzle**

 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page PP.5.


 - You may wish to model how to complete a crossword puzzle by reading the
clues and filling in the squares.


 - Direct students to complete the crossword puzzle Activity Page PP.5 or have
students look at Digital Component 15.1.


**Over the Rainbow**

 - Move students into pairs.


 - Distribute the Over the Rainbow Game Board and Over the Rainbow Word
Cards to each pair of students.


 - Review the game instructions:


   - Have each student take turns choosing from the stack of word cards.

   - The student reads the word aloud and then uses it properly in a sentence
to show that they understand its meaning. For example, for the word
_creative_, a student might say, “Artists are very creative because they
imagine and make new pieces of art.”


   - If the student uses the word correctly in a sentence, they can move on
the board to the next space, where they will choose the next word.


 - The first one to the pot of gold wins.

should demonstrate fluency, clear pronunciation, and expressive reading
to engage the group and enhance comprehension.


    - Discussion Director: The Discussion Director leads the group in

discussing key elements of the story, such as characters, setting, plot
events, and main ideas.


    - Word Wiz: The Word Wiz focuses on identifying and understanding

unfamiliar words encountered during reading. They help the group
decipher the meanings of these words through context clues, word
analysis strategies, and discussions.


    - Time Keeper: The Time Keeper helps ensure that the book circle stays

on track and manages the allotted time for each activity or discussion.
They use a timer or clock to monitor the duration of reading sessions,
discussions, and transitions between roles.

Grade 3 Foundational Skills Record


Teacher Instructions: Create one copy of the Foundational Skills Record per student. Use
assessments within the unit to track the student’s progress toward mastery of each standard. Use
the rating system to indicate the level of teacher support required and the space provided to take
notes.


  - Students at level 1 require focused instruction to accelerate learning in a specific area. Use the
Additional Supports and Pausing Points to target areas of growth.


  - Students at levels 2 and 3 should be showing steady growth. These students would benefit from the
Take Home Materials and side-bar support suggestions within each lesson.


  - Students at level 4 are excelling. Use the side-bar challenge suggestions to increase rigor.

Grade 3 Fluency Record


Choose texts from the Grade 3 Fluency Packet or the Unit Readers for students to read aloud
as you measure their pace and accuracy. Subtract the Words Missed (words that are omitted,
mispronounced, or substituted for another word) from the Total Words in Text to determine the
number of Words Read Correctly. Divide the Words Read Correctly by the Total Words in Text to
determine the students’ accuracy. Record how long it takes the students to read the passage to
determine their Words Per Minute. Consider both accuracy and pace as well as expression when
evaluating a student’s overall fluency.

**Reading Assessment Scoring and Analysis**


The more words a student can read and the farther the student can progress in the assessment, the stronger his or her
preparation for the next unit of instruction.

The number of words read correctly indicates the following:

  - Students who score 6 or fewer words out of 10 words
correctly have minimal preparation for the next unit.

  - Students who score 7 out of 10 words correctly have
adequate preparation for the next unit.

  - Students who score 8 or more words out of 10 words
correctly have outstanding preparation for the next
unit.
After scoring the assessment, you might find it helpful to
determine which phonemes students missed that caused
them to score below the benchmark for word recognition.

Instructions: This is an optional assessment of Tricky Words and high-frequency words reviewed in this unit. At the end of Unit 5, show the student the
Tricky Word List which follows this record. Ask the student to read each word
from the list, proceeding in order from top to bottom.


Provide the student with either a blank sheet of paper or card stock to place
on the word list page directly under the row he or she is reading. As the student completes a row, he or she should slide the paper down just enough to
read the next row.


Record the student’s performance on each word in the following chart, using
+ to indicate that the word was read correctly and – to indicate the word was
read incorrectly; if the student misreads a completely different word in its
place, record the word read by the student. Mark as incorrect any word that
the student does not read within 3–5 seconds.

**Appendix A:**
###### Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program


~~**THE SIMPLE VIEW OF READING**~~


Virtually everyone who writes about reading now recognizes that reading comprehension requires
more than just decoding ability. Many reading researchers now subscribe to a view of reading that is
known as “the simple view of reading.” This view, which is associated with reading researchers Philip
Gough and William Tunmer, holds that there are two chief elements that are crucially important to
reading comprehension: decoding skills and language comprehension ability.


To achieve reading comprehension, a person needs to be able to decode the words on the page and
then make sense of those words. The first task is made possible by decoding skills and the second
by language comprehension ability. If the person cannot decode the words on the page, he or she
will not be able to achieve reading comprehension, no matter how much oral language he or she
can understand. Even if the person can decode the words on the page, that in and of itself is still no
guarantee of reading comprehension. Thus, if a person cannot understand sentences when they
hear them, they are unlikely to understand those sentences when reading.


Supporters of the simple view—and there are a growing number of them among reading
researchers—argue that a person’s reading comprehension ability can be predicted, with a high
degree of accuracy, based on two basic measures. The first is a measure of decoding skills (e.g.,
a test of single-word reading or pseudo-word reading). The second is a measure of listening
comprehension. Researchers who hold to the simple view say, “Tell me a person’s decoding ability,
as ascertained by a word-reading task, and tell me that person’s language comprehension ability,
as ascertained by a listening comprehension task, and I can make a very accurate prediction of that
person’s reading comprehension ability.” If the person is a rapid and accurate decoder and also able
to understand a wide range of oral language—for instance, classroom presentations, news items
on the radio or TV, books on tape, etc.—then it is a safe bet the person will also do well on tests of
reading comprehension.


An interesting thing about the simple view of reading is that it can be expressed as an equation:





In this equation, each of the letters is a variable that stands for a specific skill:


R is a measure of reading comprehension ability.



**274**



Foundational Skills 5


D is a measure of decoding skills.


C is a measure of language-comprehension ability as measured using a listening task.


Each of these skills can be quantified as a numerical value between 0 and 1, where 0 stands for no
ability whatsoever and 1 stands for perfect, not-to-be-improved-upon ability. Most people have a
skill level that falls somewhere between these two extremes.


The equation says that if you have some decoding ability (D > 0) and you also have some language
comprehension ability (C > 0), you will probably also have some reading comprehension ability (R >
0). How much reading comprehension ability you have will depend on the exact values of D and C.


What does it mean to have no decoding ability (D = 0)? It means you cannot turn printed words into
spoken words. A person who cannot decode letters on a page cannot read. The person is illiterate.


What does it mean to have no language comprehension ability (C = 0)? It means you do not know
the language, and you cannot understand any of it when you hear other people speaking or reading
aloud in that language.


It is not very common for a person to have decoding ability (D > 0) but not language comprehension
ability (C = 0). Why would you learn to read and write a language you cannot understand? It does
happen. One famous example involves the English poet John Milton, the author of _Paradise Lost_ and
other well-known poems. Milton went blind late in life. Since Braille had not yet been invented, this
meant he could not read for himself. Nevertheless, Milton found a way to keep learning from books:
he had friends and relatives read the books aloud for him. However, he was not always able to find
a scholar who had the free time and the ability needed to read to him in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and
other ancient languages. The solution? Milton taught his daughters to decode these languages so
they could read books in those languages aloud to him. Milton did not teach his daughters the actual
languages—the thousands of words and tens of thousands of meanings. That would have been a
difficult, time-consuming task. He only taught them the rules they would need to turn letters into
sounds. Thus, his daughters acquired solid decoding skills for these languages (D > 0), but they
would have scored a zero on any measure of language comprehension (C = 0). They could turn
symbols into sounds, but they had no idea what the sounds meant. Milton, on the other hand, due
to his blindness, had no functional decoding skills (D = 0). However, by virtue of his great learning,
he was able to understand Hebrew, Latin, and Greek when they were read aloud to him (C > 0).
Between Milton and his daughters, you might say, there was reading comprehension (R), but the
younger generation brought the decoding skills (D) and the elderly poet brought the language
comprehension (C).


The Milton example is an unusual one, but it is possible to give a less unusual one. A decent teacher
can teach you to decode Russian letters (or the letters used in many other writing systems) in the


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program
**275**


**276**



course of a couple days of intensive work. Since you already know a lot about reading, all you would
need to learn is which sound values the unfamiliar letters stand for. Once you learned that, you
would be able to sound out most of the words in the language, but nobody would claim that you are
reading Russian. You would have some rudimentary decoding skills (D > 0), but you would be lacking
language comprehension (C = 0). You would be able to pronounce words, but you would not be able
to make sense of them. Essentially, you would be doing what Milton’s daughters did.


~~**HOW THESE IDEAS INFORM THIS PROGRAM**~~


Although this may seem very abstract and theoretical, there are two ideas here that are very
important for reading instruction and for understanding this program. The first important idea
is that reading comprehension depends crucially on both decoding skills (D) and language
comprehension ability (C); the second is that language comprehension ability takes much longer to
acquire than decoding skills.


Milton chose to teach his daughters decoding skills because he could teach those relatively quickly.
It would have taken him much, much longer to build up their language comprehension abilities.
Likewise, in the hypothetical example just given, a decent teacher could teach you to decode
Russian print in a few days of intensive instruction, but he or she would need to keep working with
you for many weeks—possibly even many years—to teach you enough Russian words and phrases to
understand a movie, make sense of a radio report, or read a short story.


You are facing a similar situation as a teacher in the early grades. You want your students to learn
to read. A crucial first step is to teach them decoding skills. Strong decoding skills can be taught
to most young children throughout Grades K–3. It takes longer to teach decoding skills to young
children who are learning to read for the first time than it does to teach the same skills to adults
who have already learned to read in another language, and it takes longer to teach decoding skills in
English-speaking countries because English spelling is rather complex; but even so, most students
can acquire basic decoding ability in the early grades. The children will continue to automatize their
decoding skills, learn new spelling patterns, and build fluency for many more years, but the basics
can be taught in Grades K–3.


That is not the case with language comprehension ability. It is going to take you and your school
system a long time to build up your students’ language comprehension ability because this is not a
job you can accomplish in the course of a single school year. Rather, language comprehension ability
is acquired over many years. Your students began to develop a rudimentary ability to understand
language even before they could speak and continued to increase their language comprehension
abilities throughout the preschool years. They will make even more gains in your classroom and the
classrooms they join after yours. With each new sentence they read or hear, and each new subject
they study in school, they will be building up background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural
literacy, thus increasing the range of materials they are equipped to understand, first orally and later


Foundational Skills 5


via reading. The more you teach them and the more you expose them to, the more they will be able
to understand. It takes a long time to build up the vocabulary and knowledge needed to make sense
of most stories in a newspaper or magazine, but this buildup is crucial for your students’ reading
abilities: no matter how good their decoding skills may be, they will not understand what they read
unless they have the language comprehension ability to make sense of the words they decode.


The program includes two strands of instruction, and these strands correspond with the elements of
reading isolated in the simple view of reading. The Skills Strand is meant to build students’ decoding
skills (D), while the Knowledge Strand is meant to build students’ language comprehension ability
(C) by exposing them to vocabulary, concepts, and ideas through frequent reading aloud. It is
important to understand that both strands are crucial for reading comprehension in later grades.
You may feel the decoding skills taught in the Skills Strand are more important to teach in the early
grades, and certainly, this is the area where you can expect to have the most immediate impact,
but it is important that you not neglect language comprehension ability. Remember, it takes many
years to build up enough vocabulary and general knowledge to understand a wide range of printed
materials. The building of background knowledge needs to begin in Kindergarten (if not before) and
continue throughout the elementary and middle school years.


If students are not building their language comprehension ability in the early grades, their reading
scores are likely to begin to fall off in Grade 4 and later. This has been called the “fourth-grade
slump,” and it occurs because material assessed on reading tests changes over time. As students
progress through the grades, test questions focus less on rudimentary decoding skills and more
on comprehension—and comprehension depends on having sufficient vocabulary, background
knowledge, and cultural literacy to understand the words you are decoding. Thus, the importance
of language comprehension ability increases with time. A weakness in this area may not show up on
tests in early grades, but it will show up in later elementary grades.


This has been well documented in research. In one very interesting study, researchers at the
University of Kansas looked at measurements of reading comprehension (R), decoding/word
recognition (D), and listening comprehension (C) for the same 570 students in the second, fourth,
and eighth grades. They found the two factors D and C accurately predicted R in each grade
but that C became more important, in the sense that it explained more of the variation among
students over time. The measure of decoding (D) was extremely important in the second-grade
results. Twenty-seven percent of the variance in reading comprehension in second grade could be
explained by decoding skills (D) alone. Only 9 percent of the variance could be explained by listening
comprehension (C) alone. By fourth grade, however, the measure of listening comprehension
had begun to account for more variance: the unique contribution of C rose to 21 percent, while
the equivalent number for D fell. By eighth grade, fully 36 percent of the variance in reading
comprehension scores could be explained with reference to the children’s listening comprehension
ability. The unique contribution of D sank even further. In other words, while reading comprehension
depended on D and C at every stage, as the simple view would predict, C explained more and more


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program
**277**


**278**



of the variation among students as time went by. What this tells us is that, once the intricacies of
decoding are mastered (and in English, this takes some time), reading comprehension depends
more and more heavily on language comprehension. Language comprehension depends on
background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural literacy.


~~**TWO MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT READING AND WRITING**~~


The Skills Strand teaches the mechanics of both reading and writing. It is based on the most current
research on reading and writing, but at the same time, it has been written in opposition to some ideas
that have been very influential in elementary education in recent decades. Two of those ideas are:


 - Learning to read and write is natural.


 - Learning to read and write is easy.


Both of these ideas have great emotional appeal. Unfortunately, both of them are wrong.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT NATURAL**~~


Many scholars have argued that spoken language is natural for human beings. The cognitive
scientist Stephen Pinker, for example, has argued that human beings have a language instinct,
meaning that humans are born with an innate capacity for learning language. This may turn out to
be true. It is at least a plausible theory since historians, linguists, and anthropologists have never
found a human culture that does not use language. When something is universal, it may turn out to
be natural.


What is true of oral language is not necessarily true of written language. In fact, with written
language, we know we are dealing with something that is not natural or innate because we know
when and where writing was invented, and we know that, even today, not all languages have a
system of writing. There are still hundreds of languages in the world that are spoken but not written
or read.


Ten thousand years ago this was the norm rather than an exception. At that time, there were
probably no human beings who knew how to read or write. According to the linguist Florian
Coulmas, the idea of writing down language was probably developed independently by three ancient
cultures: the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, and the Chinese. Each used a slightly different system, and
the mechanisms these pioneers developed for recording speech then spread from one culture to
another, evolving as they went. If these initial inventors had not come up with schemes for writing
down speech, we might all be illiterate today.


Writing is many things. It is an art that can be taught and learned. It is an invention—one of the
greatest inventions in human history. It is a technology enabling us to do things we could not do


Foundational Skills 5


without it—a technology every bit as exciting and amazing as airplane flight or electric power. But
it is not natural. The same is true of reading, which is simply the process of unpacking, or decoding,
what somebody else has written.


Reading and writing are both highly artificial. We tend to recoil at that word. We have internalized the
idea that natural is good and artificial is bad. Therefore, we think, reading must be natural. In fact, as
the reading researcher Philip Gough has written, reading is a highly unnatural act.


The first step toward good reading and writing instruction is to understand that reading and writing
are artificial—but not necessarily in a bad sense. We need to remind ourselves that the word _artificial_
derives from the word _art_ . To say reading and writing are forms of art that had to be invented and
need to be taught to children does not make reading and writing any less wonderful or important.
On the contrary, it makes these things more wonderful and precious, and it also emphasizes the
importance of your job as a teacher. There is no job more important than teaching young children
the magnificent, valuable, and highly unnatural arts of reading and writing.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT EASY**~~


The second idea noted earlier, that learning to read and write is easy, is also mistaken. Reading and
writing are complex behaviors, and they are more complex in English than in many other languages
because English has a fairly complicated spelling system. In Spanish, for example, the relationships
between letters and sounds are mostly one-to-one, meaning each sound is usually written with
one spelling, and each spelling unit is usually pronounced one way. This is not the case in English.
To read and write English with a high degree of accuracy, there is quite a lot that students need to
learn.


As a way of demonstrating the complexity involved in learning to read and write in English, suppose
we attempted to list all the discrete bits of information a person needs to know in order to be able
to read and write in English. As a starting point, we might begin with the 26 letters and argue that
these are the 26 things one really needs to learn to read and write English. However, for each letter,
one eventually needs to learn not only the letter shape but also the letter name (to be able to read
abbreviations and initials). So that is 52 bits of information.


That is a good start, but we must not stop there. In English, all letters can be written in uppercase
and lowercase forms, and the uppercase forms are not always the same as the lowercase forms.
Compare ‘B’ to ‘b,’ ‘D’ to ‘d,’ ‘H’ to ‘h,’ ‘R’ to ‘r,’ and ‘Q’ to ‘q.’ At least 16 uppercase letters have a slightly
different form than the matching lowercase letters. So we must raise our estimate of the complexity
of the English writing system to 68 bits of information.


We are not done yet. Students must also know the 44 sounds these letters stand for. That raises our
estimate of the complexity to 112.


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program
**279**


**280**



If there were a simple one-to-one relationship between letters and sounds, that might be a fairly
good estimate of the complexity of the code. Unfortunately, the relationships between sounds and
letters in English are quite complicated. The 44 sounds of English can be spelled many different
ways. In our work on this program, we have identified 150 spellings that are frequent enough to be
worth teaching in the early grades. That boosts our estimate of the complexity of the code to 262.


In addition, students need to learn to track from left to right, blend sounds into words (when
reading), and segment words into sounds (when writing and spelling). They need to learn a handful
of symbols used in writing, including the period, comma, exclamation point, question mark,
quotation mark, and apostrophe. That raises our estimate of code complexity to about 270 bits of
information.


We could boost the estimate even higher by adding Tricky Words and unusual spellings or by
pointing out that many letters in English can be pronounced in different ways. We could also point
out that reading a word like _thin_ requires students to group the first two letters and attach them to
one sound, and reading a word like _cake_ requires students to scan ahead, see the ‘e,’ and realize it
controls the pronunciation of the ‘a’ earlier.


Even without these additions, it is clear that the English writing system is quite complicated.


~~**THE PROBLEM WITH WHOLE LANGUAGE**~~


On a conservative estimate, there are 270 bits of knowledge a person needs to be able to read and
write English. It is unwise to ask students to tackle all this complexity at once and hope they will
figure it out. Yet that is precisely what is done in so-called “Whole Language” approaches. Whole
Language instruction is based on the assumption that learning to read is natural and not difficult,
so reading skills can be allowed to develop gradually, without much explicit instruction. Lots of
students in Whole Language classrooms do manage to figure out the English writing system, but
many others do not. Whole Language ideas have tremendous emotional appeal, but the Whole
Language approach is actually a recipe for _leaving many children behind_ . It is an especially risky
strategy for disadvantaged children.


A much better strategy is to introduce the English spelling code explicitly, beginning with the
easiest, least ambiguous, and most frequently used parts of the code and then adding complexity
gradually. That is the central strategy on which this program is based.


The strategy adopted in this program is the same strategy that successful coaches use when
teaching children a sport such as tennis. The successful coach does not ask students to learn
“Whole Tennis” and soak up the necessary skills all at once by trying to hit all different kinds of
shots the first day on the court. Instead, the successful coach teaches the student to hit a forehand
ground stroke and provides lots of practice hitting forehands. Then the coach moves on to teach


Foundational Skills 5


a backhand ground stroke, then a forehand volley, then a backhand volley, then a serve, then an
overhead smash, then a drop shot, etc. With each element taught, the student becomes a stronger
and more complete player. In the same way, this program begins by teaching the most common and
least ambiguous spellings for sounds and then moves on to introduce the more complex parts of the
writing system.


~~**KEY ASPECTS OF THE SKILLS STRAND**~~


Some key aspects of the Skills Strand are listed below.


  - This program teaches reading and writing in tandem, since they are inverse processes. English
writing involves making pictures of sounds; reading involves translating those pictures back into
sounds and blending the sounds to make words.


  - This program includes explicit, systematic phonic instruction in which students are taught target
skills needed to independently decode and encode words.


  - This program explicitly teaches letter-sound correspondences as opposed to leaving students to
figure these out on their own or deduce them by analyzing familiar whole words (as in some forms of
“analytic” phonics).


  - This program focuses on sounds, or phonemes, as the primary organizing principle of the program,
rather than letters.


  - This program focuses consistently on the phoneme, or single sound, and not on larger units.
Students learn to read words that contain onsets, rimes, and consonant clusters, but they learn to
view and process these larger units as combinations of smaller phoneme-level units. Rimes like _–ick_
and initial clusters like _st–_ are not taught as units but as combinations.


  - This program uses a synthetic phonics approach that teaches students to read by blending through
the whole word; it does not teach multiple cueing strategies, use of pictures as a primary resource in
decoding, or part-word guessing.


  - This program begins by teaching the most common or least ambiguous spelling for a sound (the
basic code spelling); later it teaches spelling alternatives for sounds that can be spelled several
different ways. Thus, the system is kept simple at first, and complexity is added bit by bit as students
gain confidence and automatize their reading and writing skills.


  - This program includes words, phrases, and stories for students to read and activity pages for them to
complete that allow for focused, distributed practice working with the letter-sound correspondences
they have been taught.


  - This program does not require students to read words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have learned. In other words, all words students are asked to read as
part of the program are decodable, either because they are composed entirely of letter-sound


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program
**281**


**282**



correspondences students have been taught or because they are Tricky Words that have been
taught. This means students have a chance to begin reading words and stories that are completely
decodable before tackling words and stories that are full of spelling alternatives.


 - This program does not require students to write words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have been taught. In other words, students are only asked to write words that
can be spelled (at least plausibly if not always correctly) using the code knowledge they have been
taught.


 - This program carefully controls the introduction of Tricky Words and words with ambiguous or rare
spellings, preferring to have students learn to read and write with regular words that can be blended
and spelled by the letter-sound correspondences taught.


 - High-frequency words compiled from a research-based list for Grade 3 are also taught as they appear
in the unit Readers. They are revisited frequently to build automaticity and fluency.


 - This program avoids letter names because what is important for reading is not the letter name but
the sound value the letter stands for. To read the word _cat_, it is essential to know /k/ /a/ /t/, not “see
aay tee.”


~~**THE BASIC AND ADVANCED CODE**~~


The program teaches the highly complex letter-sound correspondences of the English language
in an explicit and systematic manner in Kindergarten–Grade 3. Students are taught how the 26
letters (or graphemes) of the alphabet are used in various combinations to represent 44 sounds (or
phonemes). There are approximately 150 different spellings for these sounds.


Students are first taught the basic code for each of the 44 phonemes. The basic code spelling for
a sound is usually the most common, or the least ambiguous, spelling for a sound. By learning
these letter-sound correspondences first, students experience a high degree of predictability, and
therefore success, in decoding words with these spellings.


Basic code spellings may be single letters, such as these spellings and sounds: ‘a’ > /a/, ‘e’ > /e/,
‘b’ > /b/, and ‘m’ > /m/. Basic code spellings may also include digraphs, or two letters to represent
a sound, such as ‘ee’ > /ee/, ‘oy’ > /oi/, ‘ou’ > /ow/, ‘sh’ > /sh/, and ‘th’ > /th/. Other basic code
spellings include separated digraphs, such as ‘a_e’ > /ae/, and ‘o_e’ > /oe/.


The advanced code consists of all other spelling alternatives (over 100) that may be used to spell
the 44 phonemes in English. Examples of alternative spellings include ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘ss’ > /s/, ‘c’

- /s/, ‘g’ > /j/, ‘ay’ > /ae/, and ‘ey’ > /ee/. Some of these spelling alternatives occur relatively
frequently in the English language, while others are quite rare. See the provided charts for the basic
and advanced code.

Foundational Skills 5


~~**TRICKY WORDS**~~


The term _Tricky Word_ is used in this program to refer to a word that does not “play by the rules” of
spelling and/or pronunciation. Examples of Tricky Words include _one_, _said_, _of_, _were_, and _have_ .


You can describe the trickiness of a Tricky Word like _said_ in two ways. If you think about it from a
spelling point of view, you might say that the word _said_ is tricky because the sound /e/ is not spelled
with an ‘e,’ as you might expect it would be. On the other hand, if you think about it from a reading
point of view, you might say the word is tricky because the letters ‘ai’ are not pronounced /ae/, as
you might expect they would be. Either way you look at it, _said_ is a Tricky Word.


But notice that the word is not completely irregular, either. The first letter and the last letter are
pronounced exactly as you would expect. It is only the second and third letters, representing the
vowel sound, that are not sounded as you would expect. Or, if you prefer to look at things from the
speller’s perspective, you might say the first and last sound are spelled just as you would expect; it
is only the middle sound—the vowel sound—that is spelled irregularly. This is the case with many
Tricky Words: most of them have a regular part (or parts) and then a tricky part. More often than
not, you will find that the tricky part involves the vowel sound and its spelling.


When you are asked to teach a Tricky Word, the guidelines in the Teacher Guide will generally prompt
you to begin by reminding students that not all words play by the rules and words that do not play
by the rules are called Tricky Words. Next, the Teacher Guide will generally suggest that you write
the Tricky Word on the board. You may wish to ask a student to read the word as he or she thinks it
might be sounded (i.e., to blend according to the normal procedures). Alternatively, you can read the
Tricky Word that way yourself. Then you can point out how the word is actually pronounced. Once
you have established the actual pronunciation, you can point out and/or discuss what is regular and
what is irregular about the word. Most Tricky Words have at least some parts pronounced exactly the
way you would expect. For example, as noted above, the first and last letter in _said_ are pronounced
just as one would expect. After discussing the regular parts, you should then draw attention to the
tricky part (or parts) of the word, pointing out letters not pronounced as one might expect they
would be (e.g., the ‘ai’ in _said_ ). This is the part of the word that students just have to remember.


By drawing attention to the regular as well as the irregular parts of the word, you teach students
that Tricky Words are only partial exceptions to the normal rules of reading and writing. (They are
not so much irregular as they are a little less regular than most words.) There are some parts of the
word spelled just as you would expect and also pronounced just as you would expect. Then there are
some others that are not. There is a subtle but important difference between teaching Tricky Words
this way and teaching them as single entities that have to be memorized as wholes, as if every part
of the word were unpredictable.


Appendix A: Overview of the Grade 3 Skills Program
**285**


**286**



Note that some Tricky Words are actually part of spelling patterns. For example, the words _he_, _she_,
_we_, _be_, and _me_ are taught as Tricky Words in earlier grades because it is hard to write stories without
them. However, once the ‘e’ spelling alternative for /ee/ is taught, these Tricky Words can be seen
as part of a larger pattern that includes words like _replay_ and _prefix_ . Other Tricky Words, such as
_one_ and _of_, remain tricky even when most of the spelling alternatives have been taught. By Grade 3,
students have been taught the majority of the code knowledge needed to decode most words in the
English language. As such, there is less of an emphasis on Tricky Words in the Grade 3 program.


~~**SIGHT WORDS AND TRICKY WORDS**~~


One of the most common terms in the world of reading instruction is _sight word_ . Unfortunately, this
is also a rather ambiguous and potentially confusing term. Educators use the term _sight word_ in
two different senses. For some people, sight words are high-frequency words that students need to
encounter frequently and learn to decode rapidly and effortlessly. Other people use the term _sight_
_word_ in a more restrictive sense, to refer to words that cannot be sounded out using letter-sound
correspondences and may need to be taught as exceptions.


In this program, we define these terms as follows:


 - A Tricky Word is a word that does not play by the rules. It is a word containing at least one part that
cannot be read correctly via blending or cannot be spelled correctly using the code knowledge taught
so far.


 - A sight word is a high-frequency word that we want students to see many, many times and learn to
read quickly and eventually learn to recognize rapidly.


The main difference here is that a Tricky Word always contains some irregular element, whereas a
sight word might or might not.


There is considerable overlap between the two categories (which is probably why the two senses of
_sight word_ are regularly confused). Some words qualify as sight words because they are used a lot
and also as Tricky Words because they are not pronounced (or written) as you would expect. These
are words that are both irregular (and therefore hard to read and write, at least at first) and also very
common (and therefore important for student success). They are candidates for special instruction,
and many of them are given special instruction in this program.


Tricky Words do not qualify as sight words on most lists because they are not especially common.
Words of this sort are sprinkled throughout the language but do not receive much attention because
they are only used occasionally. Students can learn them as the need arises in upper grades.


Foundational Skills 5


~~**CUSTOMIZING AND ADAPTING THE PROGRAM**~~


This is a highly structured and sequenced program. We are unapologetic about that, as we believe
the structure and sequence will be very helpful to students as they work to learn the English spelling
code. However, this is not a scripted program in which teachers are required to read the manual and
give one of a handful of approved responses. We expect—indeed, we hope—teachers will tweak the
phrasing and come up with ways to customize, personalize, and adapt the instruction.


Our goal has been to put things in a logical order and provide all the guidance and support
necessary for a new teacher, or a teacher new to this kind of phonics instruction.


At the same time, we believe there is room for experienced and creative teachers to customize
and adapt the program. Indeed, some of the exercises included in this version of the program were
developed by teachers in our pilot programs!


Sometimes in the lessons, we give exact phrasing that we suggest you use; more often, however, we
give indirect phrasing and/or encourage you to explain something using your own words. You should
feel free to make changes to the phrasing. For example, you may prefer to speak of “a picture of a
sound” or a “spelling.” Later in the year, you may want to teach the term _digraph_, or you may prefer
to refer to the letters in a digraph as a “letter team” or as “buddy letters.” There are many ways to
customize the program and the language while preserving the basic instructional principles and
sequence of instruction.


For the presentation of words, you may write on a chalkboard, a whiteboard, chart paper, an
overhead projector, a document camera, or the projection system of your choice. A projection
system works especially well for activity pages since it allows the teacher to model the task exactly
as the students will be completing it. You may use a pocket chart, a magnetic board with magnetic
letters, an overhead projector with letters cut from a transparency, or a smart board. Many
modifications of this sort can be made without adversely impacting the quality of the instruction.


You should also always feel free to add additional activities and activity pages that are consistent
with our philosophy of instruction. You should always feel free to respond to the teachable moment,
even if it leads you slightly off the path laid out in the Teacher Guide.


There are only a handful of things you should not do:


You should not skip a lesson in which new code knowledge is taught. If you do, students will lack
important code knowledge, untaught spellings will begin to appear in their word lists and on their
activity pages, and the lessons will start to make less sense to them.


For the same reasons, you should not reorder the lessons. The program relies heavily on sequencing,
and instruction will be confused and less effective if the lessons are reordered.

**288**



~~**SMALL-GROUP WORK**~~


Large parts of this program have been written for whole-group instruction, but the program can be
customized to allow for small-group instruction of various kinds. You will note that there are Support
and Challenge sidebars sprinkled throughout the lessons that will guide you in how to differentiate
instruction for your students, while still using the whole-class approach described in the lessons.


Since some students will learn the new information right away while others will need more practice,
you may wish to do small-group work to follow up the initial introduction of code knowledge. You will
note that many lessons do include suggestions for small groups; you should feel free to adapt these
and other lessons as best meets the needs of your students. We have seen this program taught very
effectively in small groups and in workstations students visit on rotation.


~~**ADJUSTING THE SPEED OF INSTRUCTION**~~


This sequence will work for most children. However, all children are different, and all classrooms are
different. Some classrooms may need more time to master concepts than others. The program has
been designed so the pace of instruction can be adjusted as needed.


The most important thing for you to know is that you can pause at any point in the program.
If students are not learning the material, simply stop where you are and do additional work to
accelerate or reteach as needed. All lessons contain some materials you can use if you pause.


In addition, at the end of each unit there is a “Pausing Point.” If the end-of-unit assessment or your
observations suggest some members of the class need additional time to master the concepts
taught in the unit, this is an especially good place to stop and provide additional practice and
review. The Teacher Guides include additional work at each Pausing Point. They will typically provide
enough for at least 1–2 days of additional work. The materials provided in the Pausing Point can be
used in various ways. Sometimes you may wish to have all students do the same activity or activity
page. At other times you may wish to work individually or in small groups with students who are
struggling with a particular concept.


To slow down instruction, you can pause either in the middle of a unit or at a Pausing Point. We do
not recommend that you attempt to speed up the sequence of instruction. The program lays out an
ambitious program of instruction.


The Grade 3 program of instruction should work well for a wide range of students. You should begin
with the assumption that the Grade 3 program is an appropriate option for all students in the class.


Inevitably, however, there will be differences in learning. Students learn at different rates. Some
students will pick up the material quickly; others will have more difficulty. There are many strategies


Foundational Skills 5


for dealing with this. In general, we encourage you to try to keep most of the class together if it
makes sense. It is much easier to teach one set of students at roughly the same level than it is to
teach two or three groups at very different levels.


If you find some students are lagging, you may still be able to keep the class together for the main
lessons but find extra time two to four times a week to work with those students who seem to need
extra practice.


If this is not sufficient, you may eventually need to regroup some students. As we note in Lessons
4–5 of this unit, it is especially important to administer the placement assessment to all students at
the start of the year. We strongly recommend that teachers then use an “across grade” approach to
grouping students. If there are two classrooms, these two teachers should look at all of the Grade 3
students in both classrooms and consider regrouping students for Skills instruction only, with one
teacher taking the class of students who need review and more practice, while the other teacher
works with those students ready to move on to Grade 3 Skills instruction. It will likely be worthwhile
to reconvene at multiple times during the year to plan across the grade level, using the end-of-unit
assessments. In this way, students in need of acceleration can be moved to the appropriate group,
while students who are making progress can advance.

###### Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words

Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught will enable students to read onesyllable words with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences is no
guarantee that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllabic words. To this
end, most students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk, and read
parts of words—syllables—to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can then
be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated, and students are expected
to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, the program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the easiest
two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is already a
familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In addition, each
syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing, hunt·er, bust·ed_ ). The
dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain double-letter
spellings for consonants, in this program, the divider is typically placed after the double-letter
spelling rather than between the two consonants (e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers that are
familiar with other ways to chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is done, however,
because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single-spelling units since kindergarten
(‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.). The program strives to be consistent in representing these
spellings in the way that the students have been taught to process them (e.g., as whole entities
for a sound). (Ultimately, as students become more proficient at decoding and chunking syllables
through subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually chunk and decode
these words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding these two-syllable
words consisting of root words and suffixes relatively easy.


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable words.


Foundational Skills 5


To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


**• Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound (e.g.,**
/ **a** / **,** / **e** / **,** / **i** / **,** / **o** / **,** / **u** / **):** _let_, _pad_, _rod_, _tin_, _fun_, _pic·nic_, _un·til_


**• Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g.,** / **ae** / **,** / **ee** / **,** /
**ie** / **,** / **oe** / **,** / **ue** / **):** _cake_, _home_, _like_, _mule_, _Pete_, _mis·take_, _stam·pede_


**• Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint_, _speak_, _proud_, _play_, _dis·may_, _be·low_, _coun·sel_


**• R-Controlled Syllables:** _art_, _curb_, _girl_, _fort_, _clerk_, _tur·nip_, _ar·tist_, _fe·ver_


**• Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g.,** / **ae** / **,** / **ee** / **,** / **ie** / **,**
/ **oe** / **,** / **ue** / **):** _go_, _me_, _hi_, _a·pron_, _f·nal_, _com·pre·hend_


**• Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple_, _puz·zle_, _raf·fe_, _ca·ble_, _ri·fe_


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


**• Schwa Syllables:** _ben·e·fit_, _ap·pe·tite_, _a·bout_, _hos·pit·al_, _e·mo·tion_


Note: The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately because
of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


To decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these names. The names of the
syllable types are provided here only to establish a common vocabulary for teachers as they use
the materials. What is necessary, however, for students to become fluent readers of longer words in
increasingly complex text is that they be able to visually parse certain spelling patterns as syllable
chunks so they can quickly and easily decode each syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.


Appendix C: Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words
**299**


_ad·mit_ _nap·kin_ t _rum·pet_


For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed after
the double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is because the
double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units since kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’

- /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).


_traff·ic_ _muff·in_ _happ·en_


When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.


_mon·ster_ _con·tract_ _pil·grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read
the first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model
for students how to blend the two syllables aloud:









**300**



In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the magic
‘E’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for closed
syllables:


_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


In Grades 2 and 3, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to use


Foundational Skills 5


a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying each
possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:


_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_

|Col1|unit<br>u<br>nit|
|---|---|
|||



However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There is
no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be flexible
and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to determine
whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. To recognize whether a
word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has heard before
(i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent an additional
challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a second language.


If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:


Appendix C: Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words
**301**


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is straightforward.


When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings
in the words.


_ban · gle_ _twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_









**302**



Foundational Skills 5


In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings represent
the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a combination of
stressed and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed or weakly
stressed, its vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that linguists call
a schwa. This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’
and ‘tion’. Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite challenging for
many students.


Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the
schwa sound has a particular spelling:


_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is a schwa syllable, but it is identified separately
because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables
accordingly throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness_ _help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten–Grade
3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.
