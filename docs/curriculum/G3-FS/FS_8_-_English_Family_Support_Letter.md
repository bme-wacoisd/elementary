# **Welcome!**
### **Grade 3, Unit 8**
## **Foundational Skills**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will be introduced to new skills such as homophones, vowel teams, abbreviations,
and affixes.


**What will my student learn?**


Students will continue their learning of homophones by identifying, using, and explaining the meaning
of newly introduced homophones and practicing their spellings. Students will work on reading and
writing words that have more than one syllable and a vowel team. They will be introduced to the vowel
teams _oo_, _ew_, _ue_, and _ui_ . They will also learn how to read abbreviations, such as _Dr._, _Mrs._, and _St._, and
will have opportunities to read and spell other commonly used abbreviations. As the unit ends, students
will work with the prefixes _anti–_, _in–_, and _pro–_ and examine how these prefixes change the meaning of
base words. Students will also practice reading with the Reader, _The Other Side of the World_ . This story is
about Tisha, a girl who has trouble getting used to her new home in Brisbane, Australia, after her family
moves from Houston, Texas.
