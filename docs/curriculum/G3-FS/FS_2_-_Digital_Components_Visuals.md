**Lesson 1: VCV Syllable Patterns** **Digital Component 1.1**

##### **VCV Syllable Patterns**


There are two types of VCV syllable patterns:


           - VC/V


               - The word has a syllable that ends with a
consonant (closed syllable).


               - The closed syllable creates a short vowel sound.


               - The word’s syllables are divided after the
consonant.


› Example: logic; log/ic


           - V/CV


               - The word has a syllable that ends with a vowel
(open syllable).


               - The open syllable creates a long vowel sound.


               - The word’s syllables are divided after the vowel.


› Example: token; to/ken

the wind was so loud. Annie put her hands over her ears
to keep out the sounds.



3. “What animals will we see? Will they get close to us? I
have an animal fact book to share with everyone!” Annie
was so vocal about the trip, talking as soon as they got in
the car with the trip leader, that her father laughed.


4. Annie was so vocal about the trip, talking as soon as
they got in the car with the trip leader, that her father
laughed. Her mother placed a hand on Annie’s head and

animal,” said her mother.


5. The guide told Annie, “Just wait to see what happens.
You cannot imagine how special it is here in the wild

**Lesson 11: Suffixes** _**–ed**_ **and** _**–ing**_ **Digital Component 11.1**


###### **Suffixes –ed and –ing**

A suffix is a group of letters added to the end of a base word;
these letters change the meaning of the word when they are
added.


The suffi xes _–ed_ and _–ing_ impact a word by changing when
an action is happening.


   - The suffix _–ed_ changes an action to mean that it has
already happened in the past.


     - Example: Diego washed the dishes after his
parents cooked a big, festive meal for their
family and friends.


› The base word _wash_ means “to clean with a
liquid.”


› Adding _–ed_ to the word _wash_ changes when
the action has happened. Diego has already
completed the action of cleaning the dishes
with a liquid.




- The suffix _–ing_ changes an action to mean that it is
still happening in the present.


   - Example: Diego and his cousins are stuck in the
kitchen washing the dishes while all of the adults
play games and have fun.


› The base word _wash_ means “to clean with a
liquid.”


› Adding _–ing_ to the word _wash_ changes
when the action has happened. Diego is still
completing the action of cleaning the dishes
with a liquid.
