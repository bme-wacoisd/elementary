# **Welcome!**
## **Grade 3, Unit 6** **Foundational Skills**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will learn about contractions, final stable syllables, and spelling rules for suffixes.


**What** **will** **my** **student** **learn?**


Students will learn how to read and spell words with contractions with _not_, _is_, _had_, _are_, and _will_ .

Students will work with the final stable syllables - _ble_, - _dle_, - _gle_, - _sle_, - _zle_, - _ple_, - _cle_, - _kle_, - _ckle_, and - _cal_ . Students will

build upon their work with affixes and read words with the suffixes - _ful_ and - _less_ . They will also recognize how

meanings change when these suffixes are applied to base words. As the unit ends, students will continue working with

suffixes as they revisit the spelling rule of dropping the final ‘e’, and they will learn two new spelling rules: doubling final

consonants and changing ‘y’ to ‘i’. Students will also practice reading with the Reader, _To_ _the_ _Stars:_ _Lily_ _Explores_ _Space_ .

This story is about Lily, a girl who is fascinated by the night sky and space. She embarks on a journey to learn more

about astronomy.
