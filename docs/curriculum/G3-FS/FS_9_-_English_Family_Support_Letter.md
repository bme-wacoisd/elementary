# **Welcome!**
#### **Grade 3, Unit 9**
## **Foundational Skills**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will review, practice, and learn about types of words, digraphs, and affixes that
can change the meaning of a text.

### **What will my student learn?**

Students will review and practice synonyms, antonyms, homophones, and homographs. They will
review the suffix _–ful_ and learn how affixes can change the meaning of base words with the prefixes
_im–_ and _non–_ . Students will also be introduced to digraphs in which the first letter is silent, such as
_kn_, _mb_, and _wr_ . They will then learn when to pronounce the soft form of ‘c’ as in _cent_ and ‘g’ as in _gem_ .
Students will continue to review several spelling rules and practice forming new words by adding
suffixes. Students will also practice reading from the Reader, _George Meets Mr. Henry_ . This Reader is
a historical fiction story about a boy named George living in Williamsburg in 1775 during the growing
unrest against British rule. George’s simple perspective is what inspires Patrick Henry to deliver his
famous “Give me liberty or give me death!” speech. This story highlights the impact of these historical
events on the lives of ordinary people during a critical moment in American history.
