# **1**


### **Olivia the Ostrich**



The pilot waved goodbye to Annie and her
family. Annie stopped as they walked to the
car, looked back at the small plane, and shook
her head. The ride had been scary because
of the engine and the wind. She heard every
sound of the engine, and the wind was so
loud. Annie put her hands over her ears to
keep out the sounds. She was glad to be back
on the ground.


Annie was ready to see the **savanna** with
the flat land, low grasses, and groups of
trees spread out for miles and miles. The
savanna was different from the mountains
where Annie and her family lived because the
mountains were tall and rocky.

“What animals will we see? Will they get
close to us? I have an animal fact book to share
with everyone!” Annie was so vocal about the
trip, talking as soon as they got in the car with
the trip leader, that her father laughed.


Her mother placed a hand on Annie’s head
and said, “Relax, Annie. Enjoy the view, or you
might miss an animal.”




The car stopped, and the guide pointed to
a huge dust cloud ahead. Annie said in a soft
voice, “Please let it be a bunch of zebras.”


The guide told Annie, “Just wait to see what
happens. You cannot imagine how special it is
here in the wild because there are things you
have never seen and will never see anywhere but
here.”




Annie took the guide’s advice and waited.
The dust cloud cleared and **revealed** small heads
on top of long necks. She also saw a solo lion
trotting away from the dust cloud.


“What is a lion doing with those other
animals? What are those other animals?” Annie
said as she turned back to the small heads and
long necks of the new animals she did not know.




More of the bodies were in view. Annie stood
up and lifted her **spyglass** to her eye. She looked
closely at the animal and noticed its big body
covered in feathers. Below the feathers were two
legs.


“Are those birds? They are the funniestlooking birds I have ever seen. Can they even
fly?” Annie commented with a small chuckle.

“Excuse me,” said a voice. “But if you’re
curious, ask questions. Do not make jokes
because you do not understand.”


Annie’s mouth dropped open as she saw one
of the birds standing close to the car. She felt
like a tiny **rodent** next to a huge bird.


“I am sorry for saying you look funny, but
I have never seen a bird like you. Will you talk
with me so I can learn more about you?” Annie
asked in a low voice.


“Birds like me are called ostriches. My name
is Olivia. Yes, I will talk with you.”


Annie exhaled, nodded, and grinned.
“Thank you, Olivia. What a great moment! I
cannot wait to learn more about ostriches!”



7


She took a deep breath, focused, and asked
her first question. “Why are you alone and not
with the rest of the ostriches?”


Olivia bowed her neck to be level with Annie.
“Well, if you ask the **flock**, I have the habit of
roaming around. I like to take time for myself
because living with many ostriches gets loud, and
I like silent time. The savanna is open land with
plenty of space to move around and discover new
things, so it is a great place to walk around and
have time alone.”


Annie agreed with Olivia about silent time.
Annie had a little brother, Nolan, who enjoyed
screeching at random times of the day. The
sound made Annie cover her ears.

“Olivia, why was the lion running away
from the flock of ostriches? People say lions are
dangerous, but that one looked scared.”


“The lion was hunting and had the silly idea
it could catch and chase us. We ran swiftly, and
the lion gave up. We can run up to forty-five




Annie laughed, “I am sure the lion is not
pleased with missing out on a meal. But you are
probably glad to get away. What other traits help
protect against animals that hunt you?”


“Every animal has been chased and had a close
call. This is common in the wild. The lion may
be back with others, and that is where my sharp




Annie needed more facts to understand.
“What do you mean by ‘sharp eyes’ and ‘ **keen**
hearing’?”


“Notice how my eyes are on the sides of my
head? Their placement allows me to see more
of the savanna. My eyesight is very good. I can
spot a **predator** from far away. Keen hearing is
another way I keep myself and the flock safe.
My ears can detect a threat, which is vital for
**survival** . Ostriches can hear very well. If we hear
something, we use our muscular legs to run away
quickly.”


Annie’s eyes opened wide. “Oh my! Those
powerful legs kicked up all the dirt and made
that dust cloud!”



12


13


14


Olivia’s head moved up and down. “Yes! Our
legs are our strongest trait. Escaping threats takes
a lot of work. Being able to run fast helps a lot.”


Annie checked her animal fact book for one
detail. She did not **relent** in her search for facts.
“My book says ostriches do not fly. Is that true?
Why do you have feathers if you do not fly?”


Olivia ruffled her feathers in protest.
“Feathers are used for more than flying. Ostrich
feathers help with body heat and balance. Body
feathers **impact** body heat, and tail feathers help
with balance when running.” Olivia continued,
“Ostriches have feathers like other birds, but
the purpose of the feathers differs. While other
birds use feathers to fly, ostriches use them for
running.”



15


“Olivia, I have one more question,” Annie
admitted. “What is it like being a baby ostrich in
the savanna?”


“I will not deny that being a baby in the wild
is tough. When I was hatched, I had to peck
my way out of a hard shell. After a few days, I
could walk around by myself. After a week, I was
running with other ostrich chicks. The savanna
is vast, so there is plenty of space to run. My
parents helped me digest my food by chewing it
for me first. I am happy I can feed myself now.
Safety was important. I did not understand when
I was younger, but adult ostriches make a sound
to protect chicks from predators. The hissing
sound from an ostrich is like a siren to signal a
warning. I realize this now because I watch how
parent ostriches are always on high alert for any
threat.



16


17


18


Ostriches are also nomads and only stay in
one place for a short time. Moving helps keep us
safe, too.”


Annie thanked Olivia and settled back into
the seat of the car. She glanced around at her
mother, father, and the guide. Their eyes were
bright, and she knew the time spent with the
ostrich meant as much to them as it did to her.

**Chapter**
#### **Cooper the Crocodile**
# **2**

The riverbank was busy with lots of
animals. Annie had never seen so many
animals coming and going so fast. They all
seemed united by their fear of something
hidden. The guide said the river was both
appealing and dangerous. Annie did not fully
understand, but she was eager to learn. She
recorded many thoughts in a small notebook.


Annie saw animals look around, move to
the water’s edge, drink from the river, and
race off. She watched for hours. Many animals
**frequented** the river, but none of them stayed
for long. She was concerned they did not drink
enough water.



20


21


Annie finally spoke up about her concern.
“How can the animals survive in the heat when
they do not seem to drink much water?”


The guide told Annie a powerful **predator**
made visiting the river risky for many animals.


“What animal scares them so much?”




Annie checked her animal guide to find
information about the crocodile.


“Crocodiles have long bodies with short legs.
For protection, their skin is covered in bony
plates. Crocodiles cannot run for long periods,
but they are great swimmers,” Annie read the




“That does not sound like an animal that
would make me risk dehydration,” Annie said.


The guide warned, “Your book is missing a
lot of details. Seeing a crocodile in action leaves
a vivid picture in your mind.”


“Look! Look!” shouted Annie’s dad from the
other corner of the river watchtower. A large
group of zebras paused at the edge of the river.


“What are they trying to do?” Annie
questioned.


“The zebras want to cross the river, but they
need to make sure it’s safe to cross,” the guide
responded.



24


25


26


Annie retrieved the spyglass from her bag
and began to look closely at the river near the
zebras. At first, she did not see any reason to be
alarmed, but then she started seeing many pairs
of eyes and nostrils poking out of the water.


Annie waved her arms wildly and screamed,
“No! No! Something is in the river! Do not
cross the river!” The zebras retreated from the
riverbank and ran.


A V-shaped **snout** rose from the water.
Annie froze in place. She was stunned and
could not believe what was happening. It
looked like a small dinosaur. A fourteen-footlong crocodile walked along the riverbank
toward the river watchtower. Annie lowered her
gaze as the crocodile approached.



27


Looking up at the tower, the crocodile spoke
eloquently, “Hello. My name is Cooper. Why did
you make the zebras run away?”


“Hello, Cooper,” Annie said softly. “I was
afraid you would eat them.”


“Crocodiles absolutely do eat zebras,” Cooper
confessed, “but it is okay. Crocodiles do not
have to eat every day. We can go months without
eating,” Cooper remarked.


“I apologize for making your meal run
away,” Annie stammered. “I was not aware of a
crocodile’s eating habits.”


“That is why it is important to understand
nature. Sometimes it is hard to know why
animals do things,” Cooper said.



28


29


30


“Can you tell me a few more facts about
crocodiles?” asked Annie. “This is my first
time in the wild. But at home, I go to the city
museum.”


Impressed by her curiosity, Cooper told
Annie, “I am a crocodile and Crocodiles are
reptiles. I rely on outside sources to regulate my
body temperature.”


“What do you mean by ‘outside sources’?”


“I bask in the sun to get heat from it. That is
how I warm up. I relax in the shade or submerge
myself in water to cool down. My temperature
will influence my actions,” Cooper explained.



31


“I am also great at moving in the water. My
tail is powerful and **propels** me forward while




“We have to breathe air, but crocodiles
can stay underwater for fifteen minutes to a




Cooper said, “Crocodiles hunt when food
is near. We wait and adjust the way we hunt
depending on the situation. One of the best ways
to hunt is to wait until an animal is in or very
near the water. We **lunge** out of the water and
use our powerful jaws to bring the animal into
the water.” Then Cooper asked, “How did you
know when to alert the zebras?”


“I saw eyes and nostrils poking out of the
water. The movement made tiny waves. The eyes
and nostrils seemed to be waiting for the zebras
to move into the water.”



34


35


Eager to help Annie understand, Cooper
responds, “You were correct. Crocodiles have eyes
and nostrils on the top of our heads. Our bodies
can be fully underwater, but we can see and wait
for our **prey** . We are no match for other animals
on land. Crocodiles depend on the element of
surprise, so we use the advantage of the water to
hunt.”


Annie remarked, “I know so much more
about crocodiles. I now know more about the
behavior of animals in the wild.”


“Thank you, Annie. I will go and wait for
another chance to hunt.”


Annie turned to her parents and the guide. “I
have learned so much, and I know there is much
more to learn!”

**Chapter**
### **Lenny the Leopard**
# **3**

Before traveling further into the forest, Annie
climbed up a tree to see what it looked like.
“Wow,” she said. “It’s beautiful!” Since Annie
didn’t climb too high, she was able to jump
down the tree and land safely on the ground.
Annie planted her feet solidly and looked up
to the sun. She took a deep breath and spun
around to soak in all the sights. The forest was
incredible, and Annie wanted to see everything.


Annie asked to pause the hike for a few
more minutes. She wanted to recreate some of
the wonders of the forest. Annie, her parents,
and the guide sat under the **canopy** of the
trees. The location was a perfect spot to rest. It
was as if it had been prepared just for Annie.



38


39


40


Inspired by the scenery, Annie took a
sketchbook from her bag and began drawing
an insect trying to rebuild something on a
nearby leaf.


Suddenly, Annie heard a soft voice speak to
her: “You have a great eye for detail,” it said,
referring to Annie’s sketch.


“Thank you. I practice every day. Wait.
Who said that?” Annie looked around and, to
her surprise, did not see anyone.


Annie spotted movement on a tree branch
high above her. The mystery guest reappeared
on a lower branch. A big golden yellow cat
with black, rose-shaped spots moved into the
sunlight. The cat shifted its weight and sat
down.



41


“I remember reading in my animal fact
book that leopards have spots like yours. Is that
what you are?”


The cat replied in a deep voice “I am a
leopard, and I am pleased to meet you. My
name is Lenny.”


Annie’s eyes widened. “Lenny, I thought
leopards were active during the night. I’m
surprised to see you.”


“Sometimes, I take brief trips to explore
my surroundings during the day. I finished
exploring, so I climbed this tree to sleep. I
**scouted** this territory yesterday and planned to
sleep in this tree.”


“I don’t mean to disrupt your sleep, but can
we continue discussing leopards?” Annie asked.



42


43


44


“Sure!” Lenny agreed.


“What else keeps leopards busy during the
day?”


“If we are not exploring or sleeping, we may
be keeping ourselves clean. Clean fur helps
maintain **camouflage** . Camouflage is a big
reason why leopards are great at hunting.”


“Can you explain what you mean, please?”
said Annie.


“Leopards rely on shadows and sunlight to
blend in with their surroundings. The color
and pattern of our fur combined with the
shadows and light of the forest to help us to
remain hidden from other animals. We like to
take precautions when we hunt.”


“I think I understand. Taking the time to
clean your fur keeps your camouflage intact?”



45


“Yes! Exactly right!”


“Besides your fur, what else makes you a
strong hunter?”


Lenny shook his hind legs. “My back legs are
powerful. They allow me to leap off the ground
and pounce. I can also run quickly in short
bursts to catch my prey.”



46


Annie became more curious. “You can’t run
fast for a long time?”


“No. Dashing for long distances is not my
strongest skill. My strongest skill is being quiet
and **stealthy** to sneak up on my prey.”


Annie tapped her pencil, preoccupied by her
thoughts. “Why do you climb trees?”



47


“Trees are great protection from other animals
that may be a threat. Since I rest during the day
while many other animals are active, sleeping
in trees keeps me safe. I can never predict what
animal may enter the forest looking for prey. I
also climb trees to hide food from and observe
other animals.”


Lenny waved a paw. “Look at these!” Claws
sprang from his paw. “My claws are great for
climbing trees.”


“Any advice for a tree climber without
retractable claws?” Annie laughed.


“Well, I am an expert at climbing trees. I
suggest two things: Make sure you have a tight
grip and always maintain **contact** with the
surface of the tree,” Lenny advised.



48


49


50


Annie glanced at her travel group, “Lenny, do
you travel or hunt with a group of leopards?”


“Leopards are known to travel and hunt alone.
We are **territorial** animals and like our own
space to hunt and live. Hunting can also be less
effective when there is a group.”


Annie thought about driving through the
savanna, observing the river, and hiking through
the forest. She could not imagine doing all of
those things alone. Annie was glad to share the
experience with her mom and dad. She also
thought differently about her bad feelings toward
her brother when he tags along. It would be
lonely without him.



51


Annie raised her hand in a pretend pawing
gesture, “Thank you, Lenny, for sharing details
about the life of a leopard.”


“Keep sketching and paying attention to the
details.” Lenny quietly backed into the shadows
of the tree and returned to his solo life.


Annie stood up and said to her parents and
guide she was ready to continue the hike. She
wondered if Lenny was perched in a tree, silently
**tracking** their movements as they hiked out of
the forest. The forest suddenly became a place of
mystery and beauty. Annie wondered what other
creatures hid behind the leaves.

**Chapter**
### **The Return**
# **4**

Annie boarded the plane with many
thoughts **swirling** in her brain. After grabbing
the sketchbook from her bag, Annie talked
with her parents. She listened to her mom
describe how the ostrich towered over the car.
Studying her dad’s face as he retold the story
about the crocodile made the scene pop back
into her brain.


When asked about her favorite moment,
Annie said, “There were too many great
moments. I can’t choose a favorite.” Her
parents smiled and gave each other a high five.
After the successful trip, they headed home.



54


Driving through the city, Annie and her
parents talked about sharing their love of travel
with others. They agreed to organize their
pictures and invite family and friends over to
hear about the trip.




56


Annie began forming ideas for sketches
of the animals seen on the trip. She would
draw and paint the animals on a large **scale**,
then cut out the images and paste them on a
background. This would be her best art project
yet!


Arriving at the house, Annie and her
parents decided to keep the event a surprise.
The front door opened, and Nolan wrapped
his little arms around Annie’s legs. Annie began
to think of how to share the trip with Nolan in
a way he could understand.



57


An hour later, Annie and Nolan played
“Leopard.” The game had three moves:
climbing, watching, and pouncing. Nolan
added his component to the game by
screeching like an animal in the wild. If Lenny




Everybody arrived expecting only a simple
dinner. After dinner, Annie and her parents
guided their friends to the backyard and
asked them to take a seat. Their friends were
surprised to see and hear about the trip. The

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully leveled
in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.

The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
approximately forty sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and
many spellings can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed
to make early reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of
the available spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out
as part of their phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been
deliberately introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if
they are assigned at the proper time.

As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.


TRICKY WORDS:


camouflage, curious, dangerous, engine, favorite, leopard, successful, territorial


**Code Knowledge added gradually in the unit for this Reader:**


  - Decoding words using the V/CV and VC/V syllable division patterns.


  - Decoding multisyllabic words with open syllables.


  - Identifying the meaning of and using words with the suffixes _-ed_ and _-ing_ .
