### **A Note to Readers**

This text is historical fiction, meaning that it is a type of story that takes
place in the past. Some of the events in the story are true and some are
from the author’s imagination. Readers often enjoy historical fiction
because it helps them to better understand the events of history and feel
like they were there. The story you will read is told through the eyes of
George. George is a made-up character, but many of the events that he
experiences in the story really did happen. Williamsburg, where George
lives, is a real town in Virginia. The historical figure that he meets, Patrick
Henry, was a real person from history who is remembered today for the
famous speech that George describes in this story.


The **aroma** of cornmeal mush floated into
the sleeping loft he shared with his brothers.
His mother was up and cooking breakfast.
His father had probably already eaten and left
for his silversmith shop on the main street of
Williamsburg, where the family lived.


George’s first stop today would be to his
father’s shop to drop off a meat pie for the
midday meal. Many wealthy colonists lived in
and around Williamsburg, so his father was
always busy at his shop.


George’s mother smiled as he sleepily
approached the large table where she had set
out a bowl and a mug for his breakfast.


“Feed the chickens then come eat breakfast,”
she said as she stirred the pot on the cooking
fire. George grabbed his jacket and stepped
outside into the cool morning air.



2


He was glad that his family lived in town
and not on a farm, where there would be fields
to plow and many more animals to tend.



3


Feeding the loud and fussy flock of chickens
his mother kept in their yard was one of his least
favorite chores.


They were waiting for him to arrive this
morning and circled his feet as he approached.
One very brave hen pecked at his ankle, causing
him to trip and spill some of the feed. George,
defeated, quickly completed his task and hoped
his mother would ask one of his brothers to
gather the eggs today. He didn’t want to spend
more time in the coop.


George returned to the house. His two
brothers ate their breakfast of steaming cornmeal
mush and dried apples from the **root cellar.**
George smiled gratefully at his mother as
she filled his bowl. He ate while his mother
reminded him of the day’s errands.

“Bring your father his meal first. He was up
and out of here so early that he’ll be starving
by midday. Then stop into the **inn** to see your
uncle. Ask him if he’s bringing the whole family
here for dinner tomorrow.”


Before George could open his mouth to reply,
his mother began speaking again.


“Don’t go lollygagging at the inn or around
town, George. A lot is happening these days. Stay
focused on your errands. Do you understand
me?”


George nodded. He knew he needed to do
what his mother asked, but Virginia in 1775
was a fascinating place. How could his mother
expect him to ignore the chatter about the British
king’s new taxes and laws he was imposing on the
colonists?



7


The arguments in the shops, inns, and even
the streets of town were becoming increasingly
**heated** .


Some of the men in town didn’t think that
the colonies could survive without the support
of England, but many others disagreed. They
wanted the colonies to form their own country,
free from the king’s rule.


His mother interrupted George’s thoughts by
handing him his father’s meat pie. She shooed
him out the door, saying, “You remember what
I told you, George. Do your errands and come
right home. There’s wood that needs chopping
and some weeds starting to pop up in the garden.
You don’t have time to listen to all those men
talking nonsense about fighting and special
meetings. Hurry now!”

**Chapter**
#### **Freedom**
# **2**

George set off down the road toward
the central part of town. All around him,
Williamsburg was waking up. The blacksmith’s
hammer was already pinging as he **forged**
horseshoes, and the tailor was opening his shop
as George strolled past. Men were gathering in
groups on the street and talking in hushed voices.


George longed to know what they were saying.
He knew a larger meeting, called a convention,
was being planned for later that month in
Richmond. Could the men be talking about that
**impending** meeting? How might their decisions
affect George, his family, and his friends here in
Williamsburg? George walked into town, while
his thoughts about everything happening in the
colonies continued to gnaw at him.



11


12


Because Williamsburg was the capital of
Virginia, and Virginia was one of the largest
and wealthiest colonies, exciting things had
been happening over the past few years. George
knew that Britain and its king relied on the
colonies to grow bountiful crops and produce
the goods England needed. England must
maintain a strong connection to its colonies
if it was to continue its economic growth and
exploration of the world.


George knew from the talk he’d heard
in town some of the colonists were growing
**restless** under England’s rule. They thought it
was nonsense that they didn’t have any say in
the laws that the colonies had to follow. They
wanted to make their laws and decisions for
themselves.



13


One of the most recent laws forced
colonists to allow British soldiers to live in or
around their homes, use their resources, and
eat their food. This was known as quartering.
Many Virginians and other colonists felt it
was wrong for the king to ask them to do this.


George liked the idea of the colonists
getting to make their own rules. He’d heard
people talking about a different kind of
government, one that didn’t have a king or
queen in charge. They wanted to make their
own choices about who represented them in
the government and who got to decide about
the laws. This sounded good to George, too,
since he always felt proud when his mother or
father let him help make choices for himself.



14


15


16


He felt grateful, knowing his parents trusted
him to think carefully about his decisions, making
him want to work harder to do the right thing.


He wondered if it was the same for the other
colonists. If the king let them make some of
their own decisions, wouldn’t it make them feel
like they were valued citizens? He felt like a
valuable part of his family when he got to help
make decisions that affected all of them. George
wondered if anyone had tried to explain things
to the king like that so he would stop making so
many rules. Probably not, he decided, since you’d
probably need to use fancy words when you talk
to kings.



17


George turned the corner onto the main
street in Williamsburg. Many people were out
now. Women shopped at the dressmakers and
admired the beautiful bonnets in the window. He
was happy to see a few customers in his father’s
silversmith shop. Father was always happiest
when he had a lot of work to keep him busy.


George entered the shop. He could hear his
father talking with one of the farmers living just
outside town. “These laws are just too much.
Some winters, I can barely feed my own family.
How can I also provide for British soldiers who
are living in my house or my barn?



18


I’ve worked hard to make a wonderful



19


20


The man slapped his knee for emphasis.


George’s father shook his head
**sympathetically** . “I see what you’re saying,
James, I really do. I couldn’t understand what was
happening in the Massachusetts Bay Colony at
first, with them getting so angry about the tea tax.
Now it’s starting to make sense. The freedom to
make choices is more valuable than anything else.”


At that moment, George’s father saw him and
immediately stopped talking. His father did not
want George to worry about these matters.


George offered him the wrapped meat pie. His
father took it and told him to go on his way.


As George stepped back into the street, his
father’s meaningful words stayed with him:
“Freedom is more valuable than anything else …”

**Chapter**
#### **Talk Around Town**
# **3**

George ran down the street to his uncle’s
inn. He hoped to get there before it got
crowded for the midday meal. His feet raced,
along with the ideas in his head. He had been
hearing people talk about the discontent in
the colonies for a while now, expressing their
unhappiness with England. So why were
things suddenly becoming more **urgent** ?


George ducked through the door of
his uncle’s inn. It wasn’t quite time for the
midday meal, but a few groups of men had
already gathered at the tables in the small
room where his uncle served stew along with
the cider he pressed in the fall.



23


“Most of my family still lives in England.
I choose to live here, but I’m English. The
king will always be my king. Why would
the colonies want to leave the protection of
England, the greatest country in the world?”


These words came from a man sitting at a
corner table. The other man nodded his head
in agreement.


“If we lose our ties with England, where will
I get the goods I sell in my shop? We can’t make
items like that here in the colonies.”



24


George realized that he hadn’t thought
about how breaking ties with England might
cause problems for the colonists. Would his
father have trouble getting silver? How could
he do his job without the supplies sent from
England? What would happen to his family if
his father couldn’t work in town?



25


26


Would they have to leave Williamsburg?
Would they go live on a farm? He didn’t think
his father knew how to plant fields of crops,
and George was certain that he didn’t want to
be taking care of any more chickens!


George spotted his uncle talking to some
other men near the door to the kitchen. His
uncle looked very interested in something the
men were telling him.


George wondered if they were talking about
the same thing everyone else was: the problems
between England and its colonies. “They say
the colonies will work together and support
each other. They’ve sent the king messages
telling him we won’t pay his taxes. Some people
think we should be training a **militia** .”



27


“I don’t see how this can end without a fight,
and I’m ready for it!” The man speaking to
George’s uncle looked extremely excited as he
said the last words.


George’s uncle silenced the man. “Quiet! Not
everyone here in Williamsburg agrees with you.
Some people would be angry to hear you talk like
that!”


George thought the man was right. The
freedom to make laws was important. The
colonists would then be able to decide what
mattered most to them and live the way that they
wanted. George thought this might be worth
fighting for, even though it seemed dangerous.



28


29


His uncle noticed that he was listening
and winked at him.



30


“Do you like what you hear, George? Would
you and your brothers like to grow up in a
brand-new country with brand-new ideas?”


George nodded. He had many brand-new
ideas floating around in his head today!


Remembering that his mother had sent him
to the inn for a reason, George asked his uncle
about dinner the next day and said goodbye. He
could hear the conversation start again as he left.
“Did you hear that Patrick Henry is in town?
They say he’s preparing to give a speech at the
convention in Richmond.”


He wants to convince the delegates who are
attending that it is time to get the colony of
Virginia ready to defend itself,” said the man to
his uncle.



31


“I hope that he can do it!”


_Patrick Henry is here in Williamsburg!_ George
thought.


He’d heard people talking about Patrick Henry.
Henry believed it was time for the colonies
to stand against England’s rules and taxes. He
thought the colonies could do a better job ruling
themselves than the king. George also knew that
Patrick Henry gave speeches people listened to. If
anyone could convince the important men at the
meeting that it was time to fight for freedom, it
was Patrick Henry!

**Chapter**
#### **Patrick Henry**
# **4**

George knew it was time to head home.
His mother would be wondering why he had
been gone for so long. He passed a beautiful
church, an important building in Williamsburg
that townspeople often used for meetings. This
morning, however, it was empty—or so George
thought. But when he walked by, he noticed the
door was slightly open. Someone was inside,
and whoever it was, they were stomping around,
sounding very frustrated.


George could not contain his curiosity. He
**crept** up the front steps and applied slight
pressure to open the door very slowly. He sneaked
in quietly and sat in one of the back pews.



35


The man up front didn’t detect George’s
arrival. He kept talking to himself as he paced
back and forth. George could see that the man
was unhappy and likely did not want to be
disturbed. He decided to sneak back out before
the man saw him. But when he stood up, he
knocked a book to the floor. It landed with a
loud BANG, and George knew he had been
discovered. It was too late to sneak out now!


The man spun around quickly and stared
at George. George tried to smile, but the man
looked furious.


“What are you doing here?” the man
demanded. George gulped and took a deep
breath.



36


“Hello?” he said. “I heard you talking and
wanted to see what was going on.”



37


38


“I’m sorry that I disturbed you. I’ll go now.”
He turned to leave, but the man’s voice stopped
him.


“No,” he sighed. “It’s all right. I could use
a break. I can’t seem to find the words that
I’m looking for. I shouldn’t have yelled at you,
but you startled me. When I am working on a
speech, I get very focused.” The man reached
out to shake George’s hand and said, “My
name is Patrick Henry. Who might you be?”


George couldn’t believe he was face to face
with the famous Patrick Henry.


“M-m-m-y name is George,” he answered
nervously. “I’m very pleased to meet you, Mr.
Henry. I’ve heard so much about you!”



39


Patrick Henry **chuckled** . “I hope you’ve
heard only good things! Tell me, George, how
are you at giving speeches? I am struggling a
bit myself.”


“I’ve never given a speech, sir. But I’m sure
that yours will be fantastic,” George replied.
“Why are you having trouble?”


“I need to convince some very skeptical
people that we are at a moment in our history
of great importance. They may disagree
with me, but they must understand that our
**liberty** is at stake. My experience tells me
that the time for hoping Britain will change
their ways has passed. Our arguments have
been useless so far. We must prepare to make
greater sacrifices!”



40


41


42


“Well . . .” George started. “I don’t know
what _skeptical_ means . . . or _useless_ . . . or
_sacrifices_ . . . but I think that what you’re
saying is that the king doesn’t seem to be
listening to the colonies. He wants to make
laws and **impose** taxes without letting us have
any say. Is that what you mean?”


“Mainly, yes, but I feel that it’s more
complicated than that . . .” Patrick Henry
answered.


“You’re probably right, sir. But I’ve been
thinking a lot lately about the changes that
might happen if the colonies try to break
away from England.


“It makes me worried when I think about
it, but then I think about how exciting it
would be to grow up in a new country where
people like me could have a say in important
decisions.



43


“Maybe Father is right when saying
nothing is more important than our freedom.”
George took a deep breath and looked at the
floor. He shouldn’t have tried to correct Mr.
Henry. He was just a kid!


“George, my young friend, you may
be right. I might be making this more
complicated than it is. That gives me an idea.”
Patrick Henry jumped up and walked back to
the front of the room.


He waved briefly at George and then went
back to muttering as he paced. George quietly
got up and left the building. He couldn’t
believe that he had just spoken to Patrick
Henry. Even Mother couldn’t be angry at him
for being late when he told her about this!

**Chapter**
#### **News from** **Richmond**
# **5**

Days passed. George thought often about
his talk with Patrick Henry. People in town
continued to discuss their biggest concerns
about the colonies’ future. Some people
wanted to stay a colony under the king’s rule,
and others believed even more strongly than
ever that the colonies should fight for their
freedom.


George fed the chickens and did his other
chores back at home, including scrubbing
the floors and running more errands for his
parents. He dreamed about a new country
where he could be a leader one day, even
though he wasn’t a king or a prince.



47


He understood that the cost of freedom
might be significant, but it would be worth the
fight.


News reached Williamsburg a few weeks
later. People talked about Patrick Henry’s
speech, convincing many that it was time to
prepare for a break from England and the
controlling king. He spoke of many important
ideas in the speech, but everyone remembered
the straightforward ending: “Give me liberty,
or give me death!”


He smiled when George heard people
talking about how **impactful** that simple
phrase was. He wasn’t regretting how he had
interrupted Patrick Henry now.

future and a new country.

remember that the right to vote, have a say in our
government, and express our ideas freely make
America a special place to live.

#### **Author’s Note**

This story is historical fiction, which
means it’s made up but based on actual
events. For example, Patrick Henry,
known for his speeches, could have been
in Williamsburg, Virginia’s capital at
the time. In March 1775, a momentous
event, The Second Virginia Convention,
took place in Richmond, Virginia, not in
Williamsburg. They chose Richmond instead
of Williamsburg for this meeting because the
Governor, who supported the king, lived in
Williamsburg.



53


At this convention, Patrick Henry stated
that the colony of Virginia should create
militias, groups of trained citizen-soldiers, to
resist British forces. He believed this might
stop Britain from sending so many soldiers
to the colonies to enforce their laws. After he
made these suggestions (called resolutions), he
delivered his famous speech.


Historians, people who study history, say
that Patrick Henry didn’t usually write his
speeches down. He kept his ideas in his head
and spoke spontaneously. So, we don’t have
proof that he precisely said, “Give me liberty
or give me death!” However, other figures,
like Thomas Jefferson, who attended the
convention, wrote about his speech, leading
us to believe he likely said this phrase or
something similar.



54


Patrick Henry’s warning that the colonies
would need a militia against the British
proved correct. His words, “Give me liberty
or give me death,” became a powerful motto,
symbolizing the importance of freedom to
Americans.

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully leveled
in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.

The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many spellings
can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to make early
reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of the available
spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out as part of their
phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been deliberately
introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if they are
assigned at the proper time.

As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.


TRICKY WORDS:


gone, immediately, Massachusetts, Virginia, Williamsburg


**Code Knowledge added gradually in the unit for this Reader:**


  - Identify and explain synonyms and antonyms.


  - Identify the meaning of words with affixes ( _im-, non-, -ful_ ).


  - Identify and explain homophones.


  - Identify and explain homographs.


  - Decode multisyllabic words with digraphs ( _gn, kn, wr_ ).


  - Decode multisyllabic words using soft ‘c’ and soft ‘g.’


  - Decode words using suffixes that change the base word by dropping final ‘e.’


  - Decode words using suffixes by changing ‘y’ to ‘i.’


  - Decode words using suffixes by doubling final consonants.
