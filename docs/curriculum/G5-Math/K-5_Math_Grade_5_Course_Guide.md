**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 5


**Introduction**

Welcome to the Grade 5 Course Guide. This guide is designed to give Grade 5 teachers specific knowledge
about the structure of the instructional materials to help them effectively transition into the program.
Included in this guide is information about standards, assessment tools, the focus of each module, and ways
for families to support students at home. This guide also provides information about how to tailor the culture
of learning to the developmental needs of students, including a background on developmental advances
that affect how students learn in Grade 5 and practical strategies for troubleshooting misconceptions
collaboratively with students.


**Profile of a Grade 5 Math Learner**

Grade 5 is a year of change. Students are maturing physically, and their cognitive reasoning abilities are
increasing profoundly. These changes make young people more prepared to complete advanced and
demanding math, but these changes also make them more fearful of failure, confusion, and frustration as
they do so. Against this backdrop, Grade 5 math teachers face the daunting challenge of not only teaching
more advanced content, but also managing students’ motivation and engagement. One of the most important
tasks for a teacher is to encourage students to engage in productive struggle. This means that students are
prepared to boldly and confidently confront mistakes, turn them into learning opportunities, and deepen their
mathematical reasoning throughout the year. When students engage in productive struggle in Grade 5, they
are able to carry their learning with them into the more challenging middle school math years, rather than
forgetting what they learned soon after an assessment. As a result, more students are prepared to take and
pass math courses that keep them on track for advanced math by the end of high school. This is why Grade 5
math teachers are an important influence on a young person’s math career and overall academic trajectory.

The modules in the _Bluebonnet Learning_ _K–5 Math_ instructional materials are designed to effectively help
teachers analyze students’ work and provide the instructional support that best meets students’ needs. The
activities invite students to reason mathematically. Less emphasis is placed on simply memorizing algorithms
or relying on “math tricks” that might fail to yield correct results when the details of the problems change.
This approach allows students to think independently, problem solve, and overcome misconceptions.
Therefore, the _Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Math_ instructional materials encourage layers of activities—
fluency practice, application problems, concept development, and debriefing—to help students build their
understanding. Because students will see concepts multiple times and from multiple angles, any challenge
they face along the way will not define their math identities. Instead, it is another step on the journey to
understanding.

For students to benefit from the _Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Math_ instructional materials approach, they need
to be provided with opportunities to engage in productive struggle. This helps pull students out of the allor-nothing world of “good at math” versus “bad at math” and into a world of “we are all learning to become
better at math,” which can go a long way toward preparing Grade 5 math learners for the important journey
ahead. By creating a culture of learning and encouraging students to view challenges as an expected and even
desirable part of the learning process, teachers can help students avoid a fear of math that could undermine
the mathematical future of many students. Instead, students can start enjoying and feeling confident in math
even if their answers do not always come quickly.

**Culture of Learning in Grade 5**

As noted in the Program and Implementation Guide, the way to engage math learners and help them embrace
the productive struggle that’s needed to learn deeply is to create a culture of learning. [1] As shown in the figure
below, a culture of learning rests on a foundation of (1) high-quality instructional materials, (2) a teacher’s
intentions, and (3) the language that communicates the intent of teachers and materials.

A culture of learning can be created beginning on the first day of Module 1. A teacher can use language that
communicates their intent for all students to be supported as they are held to a high standard for learning. [2]
A culture of learning can also be maintained throughout the year since teachers will continue to support math
learners as they embrace challenge. For example, teachers can use language that clarifies their intent of
assigning the rigorous challenges students will face in the instructional materials.







A challenge for teachers is that it can take longer to use language that supports a culture of learning _._ However,
using language that communicates a culture of learning supports students’ developmental needs and learning.
In contrast, language that communicates a culture of compliance can undermine students’ motivation
and engagement because it doesn’t fit with their developmentally appropriate desire for autonomy and
understanding. [3]

|Teacher Behavior|Language that Communicates<br>a Culture of Compliance|Language that Communicates<br>a Culture of Learning|
|---|---|---|
|Introduce the next activity in the<br>lesson plan.|Do this next. You’ll get a bad<br>grade if you don’t.|This next activity will help you<br>understand the material better<br>because ______.|
|Give students a set of problems<br>that they aren’t supposed<br>to finish perfectly in the allotted<br>time (e.g. Sprint).|Just do your best.|Most of you won’t answer all<br>these problems and you might not<br>get them all correct. That’s okay.<br>I’m trying to challenge you so that<br>I can learn what you’re prepared<br>to do and what I need to teach<br>you next.|
|Ask students to explain their<br>thinking on a problem answered<br>incorrectly.|Tell me why you got this wrong.|I’d like you to explain your<br>thinking about this answer. It will<br>help me know how to explain the<br>concept in a way that will be more<br>helpful to you. There is a good<br>chance that somebody else<br>made the same mistake, so your<br>thinking can help the whole<br>class learn.|



The language in the second column promotes a culture of compliance. Students in grades 2 through 5 are
likely to perceive this as disrespecting their need for autonomy and independent thinking.

The language in the third column promotes a culture of learning because it supports students’ autonomy. It
implies that students can own their thinking and that they deserve valid explanations. This approach can help
students feel respected and cause them to be more motivated and engaged.

**Collaboratively Troubleshooting Student Misconceptions**

It is common for students to make mistakes as they build their understanding of new or difficult concepts.
From a student perspective, mistakes can logically occur whenever students try to apply previous learning to
new problems that require a different approach. To help students correct their thinking and develop a better
understanding, teachers can identify the knowledge that students are building on when they make a mistake.


The _Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Math_ instructional materials list common student mistakes for each module.
Teachers can use this information to troubleshoot mistakes collaboratively with students.


As noted in the Program and Implementation Guide, _collaborative troubleshooting_ is a routine to help
teachers address students’ misconceptions. The three steps to collaborative troubleshooting are


(1) surface student thinking;

(2) validate what the student did right; and

(3) bridge to a better understanding.


In Step 1, it’s helpful to ask questions to better understand what the student was thinking when they made a
decision. For example, the teacher can ask, “Can you tell me more about your thinking on this problem?” or “I
noticed you wrote ____. What were some of your reasons for doing that?”

In Step 2, it’s helpful to point out the parts of the problem that the student understood or did correctly. That
way, the student maintains their successful thinking as they retry a problem. For example, teachers can say “I
noticed you did ____ and wrote ____, and that’s great because that means you understood ____.”

Last, in Step 3, the teacher can build on the student’s assets and bridge to a better understanding. It can help
to ask guided questions that invite the student to build a stronger understanding. For example, the teacher
can ask the following questions:


⬛
If you keep ____ [correct thinking] and changed ____ [misconception] to ____ [alternative], then
what do you think might happen?”


⬛
“What would happen if you did ______ instead of ______?”


⬛
“If ____ [correct thinking] is true, then how does that thinking affect ____ [misconception]?”


In practice, this routine may look and sound like the following teacher–student dialogue, which is based on a
misconception for Grade 5 Module 1 Topic B that is listed in the Module Overview.

_Note: Teachers can adapt this sample dialogue to other misconceptions listed in the Module Overview._

**Scenario:** A student makes an error when comparing decimal numbers using units that have different values.
The student believes that 0.125 is greater than 0.3. The teacher has a one-on-one discussion with the student.


**Step 1: Surface student thinking.**

T: How did you decide that 125 thousandths is greater than 3 tenths?
S: I know that 125 is greater than 3. 125 has more digits.


**Step 2: Validate what the student did right.**

T: You are right. 125 ones is greater than 3 ones. When numbers are in the same unit, we can compare
them. Say these decimal numbers in unit form.
S: 125 thousandths. 3 tenths.


**Step 3: Bridge to a better understanding.**

T: What do you notice about the units? Are they the same or different?
S: They are different.
T: Let’s use a place value chart to help us name the decimal numbers in the same unit. Write 3 tenths
in standard form on your place value chart. Then write 125 thousandths in standard form under
3 tenths.
S: (Write.)
T: Let’s look at 3 tenths in the place value chart. I notice a 3 in the tenths place. How many hundredths
are in the hundredths place?
S: Zero.
T: Write zero in the hundredths place. How many thousandths are in the thousandths place?
S: Zero.
T: Write zero in the thousandths place. (Point to 300 thousandths in the chart.) Now say this decimal
number in unit form.
S: 300 thousandths.
T: Yes, if we rename 3 tenths as thousandths, we would have 300 thousandths. Now say both decimal
numbers in the chart in unit form.
S: 125 thousandths. 300 thousandths.
T: Now the decimal numbers are written in the same unit. Let’s compare them. Which decimal number
is greater?
S: 300 thousandths. 125 thousandths is less than 300 thousandths.
T: Is it true that 125 thousandths is greater than 3 tenths?
S: No, it’s not true.
T: So, what should we do before we compare decimal numbers?
S: We should name them in the same units before we compare them.

**Assessment Reflection Tool**

An assessment reflection can be powerful in helping to surface student thinking and in helping students to
monitor and track their own growth. It can also help students anticipate and process any thoughts they may
have about completing an assessment.

The Assessment Reflection Tool can help teachers guide discussions both prior to and after an assessment.
These discussions help the teacher promote a culture of productive struggle as students go into testing. These
discussions also support students’ needs after testing and give students the opportunity to reflect on their
progress and learn from their mistakes after an assessment.

**Sequence of Grade 5 Modules Aligned with the TEKS**

Module 1: Place Value and Decimals
Module 2: Multi-Digit Whole Number and Decimal Operations
Module 3: Addition and Subtraction of Fractions
Module 4: Multiplication and Division of Fractions
Module 5: Addition and Multiplication with Volume and Area
Module 6: Problem Solving with the Coordinate Plane and Data


**Summary of Year**

Grade 5 mathematics is about (1) developing fluency with addition and subtraction of fractions, and
developing an understanding of multiplication of a whole number and a fraction and of division with fractions
in limited cases which include unit fractions divided by whole numbers and whole numbers divided by
unit fractions; (2) extending division to two-digit divisors, integrating decimals into the place value system,
developing an understanding of operations with decimals to the hundredths, and developing fluency with
whole-number and decimal operations; and (3) developing an understanding of volume.


**Rationale for Module Sequence in Grade 5**

Students’ experiences with algorithms as ways to manipulate place value units in Grades 2–4 begin to pay
dividends in Grade 5. In Module 1, whole-number patterns with number disks on the place value chart are
easily generalized to decimal numbers. As students solve word problems with measurements in the metric
system, where the same patterns occur, they begin to appreciate the value and the meaning of decimals.
Students apply their work with place value to adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing decimal numbers
with tenths and hundredths.

Module 2 begins by using place value patterns along with the distributive and associative properties to
multiply multi-digit numbers by multiples of 10, which leads to fluency with multi-digit, whole-number
multiplication. For multiplication, students must grapple with and fully understand the distributive property
(one of the key reasons for teaching the multi-digit algorithm). While the multi-digit multiplication algorithm
is a straightforward generalization of the one-digit multiplication algorithm, the division algorithm for twodigit divisors requires far more care to teach because students have to also learn estimation strategies, error
correction strategies, and the idea of successive approximation (all of which are central concepts in math,
science, and engineering).

Work with place value units paves the path toward fraction arithmetic in Module 3 as the emphasis on place
value in elementary math shifts to the larger set of fractional units for algebra. Like units are added to and
subtracted from like units:

5 8 3
1 5. + 0 8 =. 1 + = 15 tenths + 8 tenths =23 tenths =2and3 tenths =2 =2 3.
10 10 1 **0**
5 8 4
1 + = 14 inths + 8ninths =22ninths =2and4ninths =2n
9 9 9

A new complexity is introduced: When units are not equivalent, they must be changed to smaller equal units
so they can be added or subtracted. One of the best models for showing this is the rectangular fraction model

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 5


given below. The equivalence is then represented symbolically as students engage in active meaning-making
rather than following the perhaps unclear rule to “multiply the top and bottom by the same number.”


1 fourth + 2 thirds = 3 twelfths + 8 twelfths = 11 twelfths









Relating different fractional units to one another requires extensive work with area models and number lines
whereas strip diagrams are used often in word problems. Strip diagrams, which students began using in early
grades and which become increasingly useful as students apply them to a greater variety of word problems,
hit their full strength as a model when applied to word problems that involve fractions. At the heart of a strip
diagram is the now-familiar idea of forming like units. In fact, forming units to solve word problems is one of
the most powerful examples of the unit theme and is particularly helpful for understanding fraction arithmetic,
as in the following example.

Jill had $32. She gave 1 of her money to charity and 3 of her money to her brother. How much did she give altogether?
~~4~~ ~~8~~



Solution with arithmetic:

1 + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5
~~4~~ ~~8~~ ~~8~~ ~~8~~ ~~8~~





Solution with units:



8 units = $32
1 unit = $4
5 units = $20





5 × 32 = 20
~~8~~
Jill gave $20 altogether.



In Module 4, students learn to multiply a whole number by a fraction and begin the work of division with
fractions. Students decompose non–unit fractions and represent the decompositions as repeated addition
sentences. They will apply this understanding of decomposition and multiplication along with the associative
property to multiply a whole number by a fraction. Then, students extend this understanding to multiply
a whole number by a mixed number. Continuing in Module 4, they learn to evaluate expressions, such as

2 1
_3 times the_ _difference between_ _and_ or _two-thirds the sum of 7 and 9._
3 5
Toward the end of Module 4, students begin the work of division with fractions using strip diagrams and
number lines to reason about division of a whole number by a unit fraction and a unit fraction by a whole
number. Through real-world scenarios, students also understand how to balance a simple budget. They apply
fraction and decimal multiplication to personal financial literacy.

Students’ work with fractions is applied to area and volume in Module 5. Now, questions can be asked about
the area of a rectangle with side lengths that are a whole number and a fraction or a whole number and a
mixed number. Measuring volume once again highlights the unit theme, as a unit cube is chosen to represent
a volume unit and used to measure the volume of simple figures composed of rectangular prisms.

In the final module of _A Story of Units_, students connect plane geometry with numerical work to investigate
relationships. They construct the coordinate plane, plot points, and draw lines. For points on a given
line, students discover a common relationship between the _x_ - and _y_ -coordinates, which foreshadows the
proportional reasoning of Grade 6, and in later grades, the slope of a line.

Grade 5 Module 1
###### **Tips for Families**

**Key Concepts Overview**

Focus TEKS: **5.2A, 5.2B, 5.2C, 5.3A, 5.3D, 5.3E, 5.3F, 5.3G, 5.3K, 5.7A**

The focus of Module 1 is developing place value understanding of decimals to the thousandths place and
applying that understanding to round, compare, and order decimals and perform decimal operations. Your
student will:

⬜ Develop knowledge of the **thousandths** place by using the _divide by ten_ pattern on the place value
chart.

⬜ Convert metric units from the base unit meters, grams and liters through **millimeters**, **milligrams** and
**milliliters** .

⬜ Read decimals to the **thousandths** place and represent them in standard form, unit form, word form,
and expanded notation.

⬜ Compare decimals using **greater than** (>), **less than** (<), and **equal to** (=) and order decimals from
greatest to least and least to greatest.

⬜ Round decimals through the **thousandths** place using the vertical number line.

⬜ Add, subtract, multiply and divide decimals.

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages
of the Succeed Student Edition to help you support your student as they work at home.


**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Practice metric conversions with the student in the kitchen. For example, measure amounts of water,
juice, or milk in liters and milliliters (1 L = 1,000 mL). Measure the weights of rice, beans, oatmeal, or

Play the “Addition and Subtraction” card game with the student. Use playing cards and take out the
jacks, queens, kings, and jokers. Put the stack of remaining cards face down.


1. You and the student will each flip a certain number of cards to build a decimal number.
2. Ask her to practice adding and/or subtracting with those two numbers. When writing a
subtraction sentence, the larger number should be written first.
3. Flip two cards to practice adding and subtracting tenths.
4. Flip three cards to practice adding and subtracting hundredths.
5. Flip four cards to practice adding and subtracting thousandths.


For example, you flip an 8 and a 5; they represent 8.5. The student flips a 6 and a 2; they represent
6.2. Then add and subtract the numbers; 8.5 + 6.2 = 14.7 and 8.5 – 6.2 = 2.3.

If playing cards are not available, the game can also be played by writing the digits 1–9 on small
pieces of paper or index cards.

The focus of Module 2 is applying the patterns of the base-ten system to mental strategies and evaluating
using the multiplication and division algorithms. Your student will:

⬜ Identify factors that make up a number less than 100, and identify multiples, **prime numbers**, and
**composite numbers.**

⬜ Estimate multi-digit whole number and decimal products by rounding the factors to decide whether
the product is reasonable.

⬜ Multiply multi-digit whole numbers and decimal numbers using place value understanding, a visual
model, and the standard algorithm.

⬜ Divide whole numbers with up to four-digit dividends and two-digit divisors and interpret the
remainders.

⬜ Divide decimal numbers with up to four-digit dividends and two-digit divisors and reason about the
placement of the decimal point.

⬜ Use a strip diagram to represent a division word problem with an unknown group size or an unknown
number of groups.

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages

1. Flip three or four cards from the top of the deck and place them face up on the table. The threeor four-digit number shown by these cards will represent the dividend.
2. Your student flips two cards from the top of the deck and places them face up on the table. The
two-digit number shown by these cards will represent the divisor.
3. Write the division expression using the dividend and the divisor. Then ask your student to
estimate the quotient.
4. Your student then solves the division problem using the standard algorithm.


For example, you flip three cards with the numbers 3, 1, and 2; it represents 312. Your student flips
two cards with the numbers 5 and 1; it represents 51. You write 312 ÷ 51 and say, “Estimate how
many times 51 can go into 312.” She says, “Six,” and then solves the division problem using the
standard algorithm. (The answer is 6 with a remainder of 6.) If playing cards are not available, the
