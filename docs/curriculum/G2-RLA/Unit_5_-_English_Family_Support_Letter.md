# **Welcome!**
#### **Grade 2, Unit 5**
## **Cycles of Nature:** **Clouds to Raindrops**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will be introduced to the many natural cycles that make life on Earth possible.

### **What’s the story?**

Students will learn about **seasonal** cycles, **plant and tree** cycles, **animal life** cycles, and the water
cycle.

### **What will my student learn?**

Students will explore the developmental stages of the **life cycle** in organisms. They will also learn
about how these organisms depend on the **earth’s water supply** and how their growth and
development relate to **Earth’s seasonal cycles** .


In this unit, students will use note-taking tools to **collect and synthesize** information they have
learned. They will work on a **shared research project** with their class and will **practice summarizing**
what they have learned about the cycles of nature.

### **Conversation starters**

Ask your student questions about the unit to promote discussion and continued learning:


1. How are plants and animals affected by seasons?

**Follow up:** Why do some animals migrate south in the fall? Why do plants grow more
quickly in the summertime?


2. How are seasons different for the parts of the earth that are near the equator? How are
seasons different for those parts of earth that are far from the equator?
**Follow up:** What are the seasons like where we live? How do we adapt to the different
seasons?


3. Tell me about pollination.

**Follow up:** How do flowering plants attract honey bees? What would happen if honey bees
didn’t pollinate flowers?


4. How are the life cycles of a chicken, a frog, and a butterfly similar to one another?

**Follow up:** How are they different? How does the seasonal cycle affect the life cycles of living
things?


5. Can you draw a picture of the water cycle? (or act out)

**Follow up:** What is precipitation? What are some examples of different types of
precipitation?
