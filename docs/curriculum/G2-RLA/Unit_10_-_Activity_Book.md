Dear Family Member,


## 1.1 Take-Home



During the next several days, your student will learn about the significance of the
phrase _fighting for a cause_ . They will learn about nine important people throughout history
who fought for religious freedom, freedom from slavery, and equal protection of the law.
Your student will learn about the way in which the work of these people had a profound
impact on the ability of others to exercise their rights. They will also understand the
connection between ideas and action, and how ordinary people can have an extraordinary
impact on the lives of others.


Over the next several days, your student will become familiar with the following figures
whose sacrifices and dedication advanced the rights of certain groups and sought to
promote the common good:

   - Queen Esther

    - William Penn

    - William Wilberforce


Below are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to reinforce what
your student is learning about fighting for a cause:


1. Draw and Write


Have your student draw and/or write about what they have learned regarding the
different causes for which people fought and the contributions made by the figures
noted above. Some possibilities might include Queen Esther fighting for the Jewish
people of Persia; William Penn fighting for religious freedom in England and the colony of
Pennsylvania; or William Wilberforce fighting to end slavery across the British Empire.


2. Rights and Responsibilities


Talk with your student about some of the rights held by U.S. citizens. Have your student
share some of the rights they have learned about in class, and together talk about the
responsibilities of citizens to properly exercise those rights. For example, citizens have the
right to freely practice their religion without interference from the government.

3. Sayings and Phrases: “Two Heads Are Better Than One”


Your student may talk about this saying and its meaning in relation to the attitude and
work of the people they are hearing about who stood for change. Discuss the meaning
of this saying with your student, and together think about some situations in which
you can use it. Have your student share with you a specific example of things they have
accomplished at times when they worked with someone else to solve a problem.


4. Words to Use


Below is a list of some of the words that your student has been learning about and
using. Try to use these words as they come up in everyday speech with your student.

     - _courage_ —It often takes a great deal of courage to stand up for what is right.

     - _custom_      - The Jewish people of Persia established the custom of celebrating
Purim.

     - _diverse_      - William Penn wanted the colony of Pennsylvania to be a diverse place
_where everyone was free to practice their religion._


5. Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read to your student each day. The local library has many
books on the activists who fought for civil rights and human rights.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they have
learned at school.

Dear Family Members,


## 12.2 Take-Home



Your students has become familiar with the following Americans who sought
to promote the equal protection of the law. The sacrifice and dedication of these
individuals advanced civil rights for all Americans. They are:

    - Jackie Robinson

    - Rosa Parks

    - Martin Luther King Jr.

   - Cesar Chavez

    - Dolores Huerta

    - Héctor P. García

your student is learning about fighting for a cause and the civil rights movement.


1. Compare and Contrast


Throughout this unit, your student has learned about the contributions and dedication
of various leaders in their fights for different causes. Talk with your student about the
similarities among these leaders as well as their individual differences. Have your student
share with you what they found inspiring about these leaders, including how their work
made a difference in the lives of others.


2. Twenty Questions


Play Twenty Questions with your student (taking turns being the clue-giver) based on
the activists they have been hearing about and the achievements of those activists. For
example, ask questions about Rosa Parks refusing to give up her bus seat, Martin Luther
King Jr. giving his “I Have a Dream” speech, Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta fighting to
improve the lives of farmworkers, or Héctor P. García fighting for veterans’ rights in Texas.
Ask questions to help your student use the vocabulary learned at school.
