**Pausing Point: Poetry Activity: “Gathering Leaves”**


“Gathering Leaves” Reading

###### Poems with a rhyme scheme, or pattern of rhyming words, usually put those words at the ends of lines. We can figure out the rhyme scheme by putting a letter at the end of every line. When a line rhymes with a previous line, they get the same letter.


**23**


Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops Digital Components 27


**Pausing Point: Poetry Activity: “Gathering Leaves”**


“Gathering Leaves” Reading



In these two stanzas, you can
see that we put a letter after
each line.


The second and fourth lines in
each stanza rhyme, so they
get the same letter. So do
lines that end with the same
word, like _leaves_ in the first
stanza.





**24**


Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops Digital Components 28


**Pausing Point: Poetry Activity: “Gathering Leaves”**


“Gathering Leaves” Reading



Let’s try an example
together.


Which letters should we
put after each line?


Remember, our last stanza
had CDED, so the first
letter we will use is F.



But the mountains I raise

Elude my embrace,

Flowing over my arms

And into my face.


I may load and unload

Again and again

Till I fill the whole shed,

And what have I then?



**25**


Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops Digital Components 29


**Pausing Point: Poetry Activity: “Gathering Leaves”**


“Gathering Leaves” Reading



Our last stanza had CDED, so
the next letter we use in the
rhyme scheme would be F.


The second and fourth lines
rhyme, so they get the same
letter, G.


Then we keep going with the
next letters of the alphabet.



But the mountains I raise **F**

Elude my embrace, **G**

Flowing over my arms **H**

And into my face. **G**


I may load and unload **I**

Again and again **J**

Till I fill the whole shed, **K**

And what have I then? **J**

Next to nothing for weight,


###### Now it’s your turn! Find the rhyme scheme of the poem’s last stanza. Remember, the last stanza used IJKJ.



And since they grew duller

From contact with earth,

Next to nothing for color.


Next to nothing for use,

But a crop is a crop,

And who’s to say where

The harvest shall stop?

Next to nothing for color. **M**
