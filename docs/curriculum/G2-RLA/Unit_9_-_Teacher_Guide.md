#### Introduction


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching the _Land_
_of Opportunity_ unit. The Teacher Guide for _Land of Opportunity_ contains eleven daily lessons, each
of which is composed of two distinct parts, so that the lesson may be divided into smaller chunks
of time and presented at different intervals during the day. Each entire lesson will require a total of
sixty minutes.


This unit includes a two-day Pausing Point following Lesson 6. At the end of the unit, a two- day Unit
Review, a Unit Assessment, and Culminating Activities are included to allow time to review, reinforce,
assess, and remediate content knowledge. You should spend no more than seventeen days total on
this unit.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


At the back of this Teacher Guide, you will find a section titled “Teacher Resources.” In this section
you will find the following:


  - Activity Book Answer Key


  - Measures of Text Complexity


  - Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Correlation Chart


  - English Language Proficiency Standards Correlation Chart


~~**INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS**~~


Along with this Teacher Guide, you will need:


  - Flip Book for _Land of Opportunity_


  - Activity Book for _Land of Opportunity_


  - Image Cards for _Land of Opportunity_


  - Digital Components for _Land of Opportunity_


All unit components’ materials can also be found in the program’s online materials.


Introduction
**1**


~~**WHY LAND OF OPPORTUNITY IS IMPORTANT**~~


This unit will introduce students to the concept of immigration in the United States, an especially
important topic because the United States is often referred to as a country of immigrants. Students
will learn about the biggest wave of immigration to the United States, which occurred between
1880 and 1920. They will discover why people immigrated, what factors pushed them from their
homelands and pulled them to the United States, and why many immigrants settled in particular
cities or regions upon their arrival. These basic facts about immigration will help students further
their awareness of U.S. history. Learning about immigration to the United States is also an
opportunity for students from immigrant families to find out more about their family history and
what brought them and/or their ancestors to the United States.


In the last three Read-Alouds of the unit, students will hear about becoming a citizen and what it
means to be a citizen of the United States. They will learn some basic facts about the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights, and about one of these documents’ key creators, James Madison. This will
help students begin to understand the many privileges as well as some of the specific rights they
will have as citizens when they get older. As students learn about the early years of immigration
to the United States and the rights and responsibilities of citizens, they will be introduced to new
vocabulary and concepts that will help them understand why the United States is called the “land
of opportunity.”


The text that students will be reading and discussing in this unit provides opportunities for
students to build content knowledge and draw connections to social studies. You may build on
class discussions to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of
Citizenship, Geography, Science, Technology, and Society, and Social Studies Skills from the Social
Studies TEKS. This content is not a replacement for grade-level social studies instruction. For more
information about the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of
the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


**Note:** We have intentionally not attempted to address slavery in this unit. If questions arise about
ancestors who may have been enslaved people, you may wish to tell students that slavery was a
terrible part of U.S. history of which we are not proud, and that enslaved people are not included in
this unit because they did not come to the United States by choice as other immigrants did. Not all
Black people living in the United States are descended from enslaved people, so encourage students
not to assume this to be the case. People have immigrated to the United States from all over the
world and still do.


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity

~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED**~~


The following units are particularly relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _Land of_
_Opportunity_ . This background knowledge will greatly enhance students’ understanding of the
Read-Alouds they are about to enjoy:


**Colonial and Native Americans (Kindergarten)**


**America: Our Great Country (Kindergarten)**


**Early American Civilizations: Aztecs, Maya, Incas (Grade 1)**


**American Independence (Grade 1)**


**The War of 1812 (Grade 2)**


**The U.S. Civil War (Grade 2)**


Introduction

~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR LAND OF OPPORTUNITY**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _Land of Opportunity_ in the forms
in which they appear in the Read-Alouds. Bold-faced words in the list have an associated Word
Work activity. The inclusion of the words on this list does not mean that students are immediately
expected to be able to use all of these words on their own. However, through repeated exposure
throughout the lessons, they should acquire a good understanding of most of these words and begin
to use some of them in conversation.

Introduction

~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit, students will practice collecting and synthesizing information by using note-taking tools
such as charts and graphic organizers. Students will also work independently throughout the unit to
write short summaries of what they have learned about immigration. In the last lesson of the unit, they
will put them together to form a bigger picture of the United States and immigration. Toward the end
of the unit, students will begin to explore the genre of letter writing. They will plan and draft a letter
as a fictional immigrant to a family member or friend in the country from which they emigrated. After
learning about James Madison and the U.S. Constitution, students will, as a class, craft their own
“Classroom Constitution.” You may wish to add the following to students’ writing portfolios:


     - E Pluribus Unum Puzzle (Lessons 1–6, 11)


    - Postmarked from America (Lessons 8–9)


     - Classroom Constitution (Lesson 10)


     - any additional writing completed during the Pausing Point, Unit Review, or Culminating Activities


**Cursive Writing**


In Grade 2, students participating in the skills units have been learning to form cursive letters and
develop their cursive writing. Students are encouraged throughout this knowledge unit to use their
cursive skills to complete activity pages. ~~**TEKS 2.2.E**~~


**TEKS 2.2.E** Develop handwriting by accurately forming all cursive letters using appropriate strokes when connecting letters

prior to the time period of this unit (1880–1920). As a short review, you may
wish to prompt discussion with the questions that follow. Remind students to
speak clearly and at an appropriate pace during class discussions.

    - Why did the Pilgrims choose to leave England and start a new life in North
America? _(They wanted to be free to practice their own religion.)_

    - Some people, like the Pilgrims, came to North America in search of
religious freedom. Others came for different reasons. What was another
reason colonists came to North America? _(Answers may vary but should_
_include they were looking for opportunities to create wealth for themselves_
_and their families.)_

immigration.


 - Tell students that immigration is the act of leaving one’s homeland or home
country, entering a new country, and making a new life there.


 - Explain that the reason we have egg rolls, spaghetti, and tacos readily
available to us in the United States is because people from other countries
brought many of their customs and traditions—including the foods they
eat—with them, and made new lives here.


 - Ask students if they are familiar with any other special foods or customs
from another country.


 - Tell students that when immigrants come to the United States, they bring
more than just their native foods.


 - Ask students if they know anyone who is from another country who has
come to live in the United States.


 - Tell students immigrants have done great things to help the United States
become the country it is today. Share that over the next several days they
are going to learn more about immigration to the United States. Students will
hear why immigrants have come and continue to come to the United States,
what kinds of hardships and opportunities immigrants have found or find
upon arrival, and what it must be like to be a newcomer to the United States.


~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION OR TERMS (5 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 1A-1: Coins showing phrase e pluribus unum**

 - Ask students what they see in this picture.


 - Explain to students that there is a very important phrase on the back of
each U.S. coin and dollar bill. Help students find the phrase on the backs
of the coins, and then read the words to the students: _e pluribus unum_ [ee]

[plor* ə *bus] [oo*n ə m].


 - Have students repeat the phrase aloud.


 - Tell students that if those words sound different, it’s because they’re not
English words. Explain to students that the phrase _e pluribus unum_ is Latin, a
very old language that is no longer spoken in regular conversation today.


 - Write the phrase _e pluribus unum_ on the board or chart paper. Help students
discover the meaning of the phrase.


   - What do you see or hear in the word _pluribus_ ? _(the word_ plural _)_ What does
the word _plural_ mean? _(many)_

conditions, and move to an entirely new





country? ~~_[Allow students to answer.]_~~


This is one question we have to think about if



we’re going to understand how the United States of America began and how

it has become the country it is today—a nation made up of many different

people from many different countries. The United States is sometimes called

a country of **immigrants** . Immigrants are people who leave their home

Lesson 1 E Pluribus Unum

Challenge


Students who
participated in
the program in
Kindergarten and
Grade 1 should
remember some facts
about the Wampanoag
and the Lakota Sioux
from the _Colonial and_
_Native Americans_ unit
and about the Maya,
Aztec, and Inca people
from the _Early American_
_Civilizations: Aztecs,_
_Maya, Incas_ unit. Ask
one or two students
to share something
they remember about
these groups.


**14**



there was a country called “the United States,” but there were already people

living in North, South, and Central America and on some of the islands in the

Caribbean Sea. We use the term _Native American_ to refer to those—like the

Wampanoag and the Lakota Sioux—who were already living in North America

before the Europeans arrived. Maybe you remember the Maya and Aztec

people, who lived in Mexico, or the Inca whose empire spread across Peru,

Chile, and other lands in South America. To these groups, the places where

they lived were not “new” at all, because their **ancestors** —the relatives who

came before them—had lived there for centuries.


**Show Image 1A-4: Columbus nearing land**

Europeans traveled to the “New World”

for many different reasons. For example,

Christopher Columbus came looking for

a shortcut from Europe to Asia. Spanish

explorers such as Cortés came looking for





wealth. ~~_[Students who participated in the_~~

~~_program in Kindergarten and Grade 1 should_~~



~~_remember learning about these early explorers.]_~~ Later, more people came

from Europe who were not just explorers. Some wanted to bring their religion

to the people already living here. Some were poor men and women who

thought there was a chance to make money to take back to their homeland,

where they hoped to lead easier, more comfortable lives with their new

wealth. Others were adventurers attracted to the excitement of a new place.

The greater number of these travelers to North and South America did not

actually want to settle in the Americas and make the “New World” their home

for good. Instead, they wanted to return to their own home countries after

gaining some wealth or making new discoveries. ~~_What are some reasons_~~

~~_people first traveled to the “New World” or America?_~~


**Show Image 1A-5: Pilgrims**

Much later, a group of people we call the

Pilgrims were looking for a place where they

could follow their own religion without being

told what to believe by the king of England.

~~_When people practice religion, they are_~~





~~_meeting to share ideas, songs, and prayers that_~~

~~_are connected to what they believe about the_~~

~~_world and life._~~ Back in England, they were


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


known as Separatists and they lived in fear of being arrested and thrown in

jail for not having the same religious beliefs as their king. In order to meet

together and practice their religion without fear, they decided to leave

England behind. They hoped that there would be plenty of room in the “New

World” in which to have the **freedom** ~~_or the ability to choose how_~~ to live and

practice their religion in their own way. The Pilgrims were not the very first

settlers in the “New World,” part of which we now call the United States. They

were important, however, because they helped to set an example by doing

something new and different.


So, what is an immigrant? An immigrant is someone who comes from

another country to settle in a new place. Do you remember the question I

asked you at the beginning of the lesson? Why might someone leave the

home they knew and move to an entirely new country?


**Show Image 1A-6: Collage of push factors**

Reasons immigrants leave their homes and

come to live in a new country are push and

**pull factors** . ~~_Factors are the reasons that_~~

~~_something happens or doesn’t happen in a_~~

~~_certain way._~~ **Push factors** are the problems





in one’s home country that would “push”

you out of your country, or make you leave.

||**1A-6**|



~~_What situations do you see in this picture that are push factors?_~~ For many

immigrants, money problems, trouble in their home government, and/or

a lack of religious freedom pushed them to **immigrate**, or move to a

new country.


**Show Image 1A-7: Collage of pull factors**

On the other hand, having more freedom and

more job opportunities than are available

to them in their homelands have “pulled,”

or encouraged, people to immigrate to the

The origin of _e pluribus_

reasons, they all can become citizens and

nation that allows and encourages different beliefs among people. _E pluribus_

_unum_ [ee] [plor* ə *bus] [oo*n ə m], meaning “out of many, one” in Latin, was

the original motto of the United States. Remember the coins I showed you?

If you look on the back of any U.S. coin or on the back of a U.S. dollar bill, you

can find this motto. ~~_[Help students find the motto on the bill in the image. Have_~~

~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. Literal. What is an immigrant? _(someone who leaves their home country to_
_settle and make a new life in a new country or region)_


Check for Understanding


**Use Evidence:** The author makes the statement, “Reasons
immigrants leave their homes and come to live in a new country
are push and pull factors.” Ask students why immigrants leave
their home country and come to America using the following
questions to lead the discussion:


         - What are some of the push factors that you heard the author
give as examples of why people would leave their homelands?
_(fear and lack of freedom to practice one’s religion; money_
_problems; problems in the government)_


         - What are some of the pull factors that you heard the author give
as examples of why people would come to the United States?
_(freedom of religion and speech, better job opportunities)_


2. Literal. What does the United States’ original motto _e pluribus unum_ mean?
_(“out of many, one”)_ Where can you find this motto? _(on the backs of coins_
_and dollar bills)_


3. Evaluative. _Think-Pair-Share:_ Why was _e pluribus unum_ a good motto for
the United States? _(The United States is a country made up of many different_
_immigrants who have come together to form one nation.)_ ~~**TEKS 2.6.E**~~

~~**WORD WORK: FACTORS (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud today, we heard, “Reasons immigrants leave their homes
and come to live in a new country are push and pull factors.”


2. Say the word _factors_ with me.


3. Factors are the reasons that something happens or doesn’t happen a
certain way.


4. Nutrition is one of the factors I consider when I choose what food to eat
for lunch.


5. Push factors are reasons that cause people to leave their homelands. Pull
factors are reasons that cause people to come to a new country. What push
factors might cause a person to leave their homeland? What pull factors
might cause a person to go to a particular new country? [Ask two or three
students. If necessary guide and/or rephrase students’ answers: “A pull/push
factor might be . . . ”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I am going to ask several
questions in which you are asked to think about what you would do based on
the factor mentioned. If the factor would make a difference in your choice,
say, “That would be a factor for me.” If the factor would not make a difference
in your choice, say, “That would not be a factor for me.” _(Answers may vary.)_


 - Would you choose to eat a food based on its color?


 - Would you choose to play a game you really like based on whether you are
friends with the other people who are playing?


 - Would you apologize to a friend or family member based on knowing you had
hurt their feelings?


 - Would you volunteer to do a hard job based on knowing you would get
a reward?

there was a greater chance of doing that in America than in their old countries.

Others came from poor places, where finding food or shelter had been a

desperate, daily struggle. They hoped that if they worked hard in this new place,

four feet tall, and whose body, instead of

growing straight, seemed to bend to one side.

~~_factors that led Charles to America._~~


Charles had written an article that said his nation’s government was to

blame for many problems. In many countries, writing such an article could

land a person in trouble. One day, a friend warned Charles, “My brother, who

works for the government, says that the police are going to arrest you and

later, the two friends stood at the railing staring up at the statue whose lamp

lit the way toward a new homeland. ~~_What statue did they see?_~~


Beyond the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor was another island called

Ellis Island. There were enormous buildings and docks on this island

where ships could anchor and unload passengers. ~~_[Show Image Card 2_~~

Charles thought, “That is Ellis Island. That is where the American government

decides who gets to enter the country and who might be turned away. I know

that only a few people are turned away: those who are dangerous, sick, or do

not have the papers saying they can move to a new country. Will they let me

immigrants. Most people were allowed in, but Charles worried, “What will I

Finally, he reached the head of the line. A government clerk asked him a

question, but Charles did not understand English. The clerk called over

an **interpreter** who knew many languages, including German. Using the

interpreter to turn his English words into German, the clerk asked, “What is

your name?”


**Show Image 2A-6: Charles being interviewed**

**by clerk**

Charles said his name, and the clerk wrote it in

a book. Then without looking up, he asked, “Do

you have a job waiting here for you?”



Challenge


Based on the way it is
used in the sentence,
what do you think an
interpreter is?





“No,” Charles answered.



“Do you have any money to live on until you find a job?”


“No,” Charles admitted.


Now the clerk looked up at Charles and shook his head. “So you have no

money and no job, and you speak no English. I am sorry, but we want people

who can add something to our nation.”


Just then, Charles’s friend Oscar stepped forward. “If you turn this man

away,” he said, “you will be making the greatest mistake of your life. This is

Charles Steinmetz, one of the greatest scientific and mathematical thinkers

in the world! He may be only four feet tall, but he has many talents. You want

citizens who can improve this country. He can! I am so sure of it that I will

pay all his expenses until he has a job.”

~~_character._~~ Two hours later, Oscar’s uncle

welcomed Oscar and Charles to his big house



in New York City. Soon afterward, Charles Steinmetz began to learn English

and went to work at a large company, using his powerful mind to invent useful

new products. He helped improve the way electricity is carried through wires

in order to bring electric power to buildings and houses. He helped to make

**29**


electric streetlights possible and worked with the famous American inventor

Thomas Edison. Charles wrote books that helped other scientists understand

electricity. He made more than two hundred scientific discoveries!


**Show Image 2A-8: Charles older**

These discoveries made Charles Steinmetz

famous and earned him a great deal of money,

but he never forgot how other people had

helped him. While continuing his scientific

work, Charles began teaching at a college near





New York City. He refused to take any pay for

his teaching, saying, “Teaching others how to



create useful inventions is the best way to repay the United States for taking

me in.” ~~_Why did Charles refuse, or not accept, pay for his teaching?_~~


His friend Oscar understood. He explained in later years, “Like so many

others, Steinmetz came to America so he could help others with his talents

and also have a good job and life for himself. That is why they call the United

States the ‘land of **opportunity** .’” Like many other immigrants, the move to

America gave Charles a new chance to achieve something.


Oscar continued, “I believe that each person brings something good to share.

Putting all our talents together can make the United States and its citizens

stronger and happier. But just think: that clerk at Ellis Island almost turned

Charles Steinmetz away!”


**Show Image 2A-9: Many different immigrants**

**at Ellis Island**

Charles Steinmetz and his friend Oscar were

two of the twenty-three million immigrants

who came to the United States between the

years of 1880 and 1920. The majority of these





immigrants were from the European continent.

Like Charles, these European immigrants



**30**



sailed into New York Harbor and were registered into the United States at

Ellis Island. Sometimes immigrants’ names were recorded and changed or

shortened to make them easier to say. And sometimes, as almost happened

to Charles, immigrants were turned away if they were too sick or did not

have the right papers. Can you imagine what your life would be like today if

Charles Steinmetz had been sent back to Germany?

**window to the busy street below**

Marie awoke to the sound of a voice outside

her window calling,





_“Buy my fresh fruit, good to eat!_
_Crunchy apples, red and gold,_
_Sweet cherries,_
_Strawberries,_
_Buy my fresh fruit, good to eat!”_



Then, like the different-colored yarns her grandmother knitted together

to make a scarf, the sounds of the city began to weave together, one

after another. First, Marie heard the clear ringing of bells hanging

around the necks of the goats that provided goat’s milk to some of the

neighbors’ homes. Then, she heard a creaking sound she knew belonged

to Mister Jacobi’s wagon. He delivered cow’s milk and cheese from his dairy

across town.

Now Mister Diplas, a jolly Greek man, started calling,


_“Knife sharpener!_
_Knife sharpener!_
_Axes, scissors, shovels, picks,_
_Blades and handles I can fix.”_


Marie liked the grinning little man. He was built as solidly as a bull, and he

walked the city streets pushing a cart that held his sharpening stone and tools.


**Show Image 3A-2: Marie awakening her**

Marie awakened her two younger sisters,

who shared the bed with her, then crossed

the little room in two steps to wake her baby

brother, who was still small enough to sleep in







an open drawer of their old, wooden dresser.

“Everybody up!” she said.

“Still,” she thought, “at least Papa has a job. Back home, there were no jobs,

very little to eat, and the floors in our little house were made of dirt. Here

in America, there is plenty to eat and we live in a good building. I wish there

were not so many people crowded in with us, though. I do like having so

many friends, and I enjoy the city, but sometimes I would like it to be quiet,

the way it was in our little village in Italy. But I am very thankful to be here

in America where there are so many opportunities.” ~~_How do you think Marie_~~

~~_feels about her new life in America?_~~


**Show Image 3A-5: Immigrants at Ellis Island**

Marie’s life was typical of the lives of the

millions of immigrants who came from Europe

and Asia to the United States for better job

opportunities in the 1800s and early 1900s.

The largest wave, or group, of immigrants,





twenty-three million people, came to the

United States between 1880 and 1920. ~~_Twenty-_~~



~~_three million is a big number, isn’t it? That’s more people than live in the_~~

~~_entire state of Florida today!_~~ Immigrants from Europe entered through Ellis

Island in New York Harbor, and many stayed near the harbor, living in or

around New York City on the East Coast. Other immigrants moved away from

New York to join friends or relatives who were already living farther north in

Boston, south in Philadelphia, or west in the great cities of the Midwest, such

as Chicago, Detroit, or Cleveland. ~~_[Point out these cities on a U.S. map.]_~~


**Show Image 3A-6: Immigrants at Angel**
**Island**

Meanwhile, Chinese and other immigrants

from Asia came to the West Coast of the

United States through the city of San

Francisco, passing through the Angel Island



Support


The coast is the area
along or near a sea or
ocean. Another meaning
of _coast_ is to move
along easily, as when
you coast on a bicycle
or sled.





Immigration Center in San Francisco Bay.

~~_Show me on a U.S. map where Angel Island and_~~



~~_the San Francisco Bay are located._~~ There were fewer Asian immigrants, so

the immigration center on Angel Island was not as large as the immigration

center on Ellis Island in New York Harbor. Still, there was a steady stream of

immigrants, and these Chinese and other Asian immigrants settled in cities

around the San Francisco Bay or moved inland away from the ocean. They

would often stop in the mining camps of the California mountains in search

of gold, joining other gold seekers from across the United States and from


Lesson 3 Life in the City
**41**


other nations around the world. After finding no gold, many Chinese went

to find work building the railroads that would soon join the East and West

Coasts of the country. This railroad would be called the Transcontinental

Railroad.


**Show Image 3A-7: Immigrant factory workers**

Although many immigrants settled in the

countryside as farmers or villagers, most of

them made their homes in the big cities of

America. ~~_What are some of the big cities you_~~

~~_just heard about? [Point to the cities on the_~~





~~_U.S. map.]_~~ ~~M~~ any immigrants settled in these

large cities because there were more jobs



there. Earlier immigrants remembered the hardships and difficulties they

had experienced settling in a new country and often helped the **newcomers**

~~_or people who had recently arrived in the United States_~~ to find jobs. City

immigrants worked in factories, making everything from shirts and dresses

to the buttons and buckles that closed them; from small wooden picture

frames to huge wooden railroad cars; from loaves of bakery bread to

huge ovens in which to do the baking. Some owned their own businesses,

little shops and stores that sold produce to eat or goods from their home

countries. Others sold items from carts or wagons, which they pushed

themselves or had horses pull for them. ~~_What were some of the hardships_~~

~~_that newcomers faced?_~~


**Show Image 3A-8: Old photo of**
**neighborhood in New York City**

Wherever they came from and wherever

they settled, the newcomers found other

immigrants who had brought with them

the **customs**, the foods, and the languages





of their home countries. ~~_Customs are the_~~

~~_beliefs and ways of doing things that have_~~



**42**



~~_been long established. Different immigrants have different customs and_~~

~~_traditions depending on where they are from._~~ Many immigrants who lived

in the cities gathered in ethnic neighborhoods with other immigrants from

their native countries. People would say, “That’s Little Italy over there,” or

“This neighborhood is called Chinatown.” Germans, Polish, Italians, Irish,

European Jewish, Japanese, Norwegians, and many other groups had what

they thought of as their own parts of town. They felt at home there. Cafés


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


and restaurants served their **traditional** foods made with old and familiar

recipes. Crowded apartments were decorated with familiar items from home,

and all around them they heard the languages from their homelands. By

living close together, immigrants not only felt more at home, they were also

able to support each other in finding jobs and learning English.


**Show Image 3A-9: People on the street**

Immigrants felt safer and more comfortable

in these neighborhoods, but they would often

have to travel outside their parts of town to

work and live. Sometimes, when they left

their neighborhoods and met people from





other places, they learned from one another

and enjoyed it. Sometimes they met only



unfriendliness. Immigrants discovered that some people from outside their

community could often be **hostile** ~~_or very unfriendly and unwelcoming_~~

toward them because they were different. Some Americans believed that

immigrants were coming into the country and taking their jobs.


However difficult their new lives in America could be, the lives of many

immigrants improved when they moved to and settled in the United States.

The longer immigrant families lived in the United States, the less hostility

they felt. ~~_You just heard that_~~ ~~hostile~~ ~~_means unfriendly or unwelcoming. The_~~

~~_word_~~ ~~hostility~~ ~~_comes from_~~ ~~hostile~~ ~~_. What do you think it means?_~~ Over time,

children of immigrants felt even less hostility, as did their children’s children.

_life, more job opportunities, the possibility of wealth, welcoming ethnic_
_neighborhoods)_


4. Literal. Charles Steinmetz and Marie’s family entered the United States
through which immigration center? _(Ellis Island)_ Through which immigration
center did many Chinese and other Asian immigrants enter the United
States? _(Angel Island)_


5. Inferential. What was one of the pull factors that attracted the Chinese
immigrants to the California mountains? _(hopes of finding gold and_
_becoming wealthy)_


6. Literal. [Have a U.S. map available to identify the cities mentioned.] Many
immigrants who entered through Ellis Island chose to live in nearby New
York City. In what other cities that you heard about did immigrants settle?
_(Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Cleveland, Boston, and San Francisco)_


Check for Understanding


**Use Evidence:** What reasons does the author give to explain why
immigrants often chose to live in the big cities of America? _(There_
_were more jobs there, and earlier immigrants, remembering the_
_hardships that came with settling in a new country, often helped_
_the newcomers find jobs and learn English. Immigrants could feel_
_comfortable keeping their customs and traditions.)_


7. Evaluative. _Think-Pair-Share:_ If you were an immigrant during the 1880s to
1920s, what would you have liked about living in a big city? What would you
have disliked? _(Answers may vary.)_

~~**WORD WORK: TRADITIONAL (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Cafés and restaurants served their traditional
foods . . . ”


2. Say the word _traditional_ with me.


3. _Traditional_ means customary or long-established, and describes something
that has been done in the same way for a long time.


4. Larry’s mother and father decorate their house in a traditional way just as
their grandparents had many years ago.


5. Do you and your family have any traditional recipes, dinners, or clothes? Do
you have any traditional customs? Try to use the word _traditional_ when you
tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase
the students’ responses: “My family has a traditional . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I am going to read several
sentences. If the sentence describes a common or long-standing way of
doing things, say, “That is traditional.” If the sentence describes a way of
doing things that’s new or only recently used, say, “That is not traditional.”


  - Candice made the pizza the same way her mother, grandmother, and greatgrandmother made their pizzas. _(That is traditional.)_


  - Matt and Kim arranged the crops in a new pattern instead of the way their
father and grandfather had taught them. _(That is not traditional.)_


  - Instead of going to a movie on Friday night, the way they usually did, the
Millers played board games at home. _(That is not traditional.)_


  - Trip would always have turkey as part of his Thanksgiving dinner, just like his

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**

           - The purpose of syntactic activities is to help students understand the direct
connection between grammatical structures and the meaning of text. These
syntactic activities should be used in conjunction with the complex text
presented in the Read-Alouds.


**Universal Access**

           - Keep an adjective wall throughout the rest of the unit. Encourage students
to identify adjectives in the Read-Aloud, or in everyday speech or reading,
and then add them to the wall. Consider including pictures or illustrations
that help students understand why the listed word is an adjective (e.g.,
for the adjective _red,_ draw a red apple beside the word _red_ ). Students can
reference the adjective wall when they are writing in order to make their
writing more descriptive.

~~**TEKS 2.1.A; TEKS 2.1.C**~~


~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED? (5 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.1.C**~~


  - Ask students to share what they learned in the previous lesson
about immigration to a city. You may prompt discussion with the questions
that follow. Remind students to speak clearly at an appropriate pace during
class discussions.


    - What is an immigrant? _(someone who leaves their home country to settle_
_and live in a new country or region)_

    - Why did immigrants come from Europe and Asia to the United States? _(for_
_a better life and job opportunities)_

    - What are the names of the two immigration centers at that time? _(Ellis_
_Island and Angel Island)_ Where were they located? _(New York Harbor and_
_San Francisco Bay)_

    - Why did immigrants choose to settle in the big cities? _(There were more_
_jobs in the cities, and earlier immigrants often helped the newcomers_
_find jobs.)_

    - Why did many immigrants choose to live near one another? _(By living close_
_together, immigrants felt more at home and were able to support each_
_other in finding jobs and learning English.)_


~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION OR TERMS (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that today’s Read-Aloud takes place in New York City. On a U.S.
map, have students locate the city of New York, New York.


  - Ask students to name any other landmarks learned in this unit that are located
in or near New York. _(Ellis Island, New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty)_

Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


 - Tell students that Irish immigrants were some of the people who settled in
New York City.


 - Tell students that Irish immigrants are from the country of Ireland. Show
students Ireland on a world map or globe.


 - Share with students that it is thought that as many as four and a half million
Irish immigrated to the United States between the years 1820 and 1930.


**Show Image 4A-1: Healthy potato crop/failed crop**

 - Tell students that one push factor occurred in Ireland in 1845. In that year,
the potato crop in Ireland, the main food crop there, suddenly died. When
this happened, many people in Ireland had very little to eat, so many
people decided to immigrate to the United States for a better life and job
opportunities.


 - Remind students that the word _immigrate,_ spelled with an ‘i’, means to enter
into a new country and settle down.


 - Ask students what they think the word _emigrate,_ spelled with an ‘e’, means.
Tell them that the word _emigrate_ means to leave one country or region to
go to another. Tell students that in this Read-Aloud they will hear about
a family from Ireland that emigrated from Ireland and immigrated to the
United States.

**Show Image 4A-2: Sean and Fiona entering**
**Uncle Brendan’s restaurant**

For once, Sean and Fiona Murphy were grateful

for the crowds of people on their street in New

York City. It was a freezing cold day in 1858,

and all those bodies helped block the powerful





wind blowing in from the Hudson River. Fiona

told Sean, “Let’s go into Uncle Brendan’s,” and



**52**



a minute later they entered their uncle’s little restaurant named “Murphy’s”

after their family. The cold followed them in, so they quickly shut the door

behind themselves.


A familiar voice called out, “Well now, look who the cat dragged in!” It was

Uncle Brendan.


“It wasn’t a cat,” Sean laughed, “It was Fiona. I’m hungry, Uncle Brendan.”


“You’re a fifteen-year-old boy,” his uncle answered. “You’re always hungry. Sit

down and I’ll get each of you a plate. But Sean, don’t you eat so much that

you leave nothing left for my paying customers.”

Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


**Show Image 4A-3: Aunt Cathleen and Fiona**
**talking**

Just then, Aunt Cathleen came out from the

kitchen and walked over. Quietly she asked,

“How’s your ma?”


Fiona grew serious. “Not so good, Auntie. She

says she should be used to this cold after

living in a drafty, one-room shack back in



Ireland, but this New York winter is doing something to her. And you know Pa.

He never says he’s worried, but when he was home last month, I could see it

in his eyes. I’ve been wishing he could be home more.”


Aunt Cathleen replied, “He’s lucky to have a job. Working to lay railroad

tracks out West may take him away often, but his pay is putting food in your

mouth and paying for whatever heat we can get in our home.” Fiona’s family,

including her aunt and uncle, had been sharing a tiny apartment ever since

they had **emigrated** from Ireland to settle in the United States. ~~_What does_~~

~~emigrated~~ ~~_mean?_~~ Uncle Brendan’s restaurant, Murphy’s, was doing well now,

but he and his brother Peter, Sean and Fiona’s father, were still paying back

the money they owed for buying the restaurant. Any money they earned

helped the whole family.


**Show Image 4A-4: Sean smelling the food**

By now, plates of food had appeared in front of

Sean and Fiona. Sean breathed in the familiar

smells of the food from his home country,

Ireland. “Ah, bacon joint and potatoes,” he told

Aunt Cathleen. “It reminds me of Ireland every





time I smell your cooking.” ~~_Bacon joint is a_~~

~~_traditional Irish dish made up of various pieces_~~

~~_of smoked and salted pork._~~



“It should,” she answered, “since I cooked the same foods for you there.

Only we have more to eat here. There was never enough food to eat after

the potato **blight** ruined our main food source in Ireland. ~~_A blight is a kind_~~

~~_of plant disease that causes the sudden death of the plant or crop._~~ Even your

pa, the strongest man I know, was getting weak from hunger. It’s a blessing

to come to a country where there’s food to eat—the ‘land of opportunity,’

indeed. Back in Dublin, Ireland, we worked just as hard and had a lot less.”

~~_Based on what I just read, what does the phrase_~~ ~~land of opportunity~~ ~~_mean?_~~

_Land of opportunity_
means a country where
people can work hard
and be rewarded well

~~_Why does Aunt Cathleen call the United States the “land of opportunity” in_~~

~~_comparison to Ireland?_~~


“Aye,” said Uncle Brendan, “we would never have been able to own a restaurant

back in Ireland, and even if we could have, no one had money enough to be

a paying customer. We had so many hardships back home. We complained

when all we had to eat in Ireland was potatoes, but we suffered tremendously

when the potatoes were no longer there. Our family had to pay a lot of money

to immigrate to America, and even with all the difficulty we are going through,

it has all been worth it. We have a good place to live in a neighborhood of Irish

folks like us. Sure, some people have been hostile toward us, but there’s more

food on our table than we ever had back home in Ireland and, crowded as it

may be, I prefer New York City to farming the rocky Irish soil. Still, I do miss a

lot of the folks we left behind when we emigrated from Ireland.”


**Show Image 4A-5: Uncle Brendan greeting**
**Michael Connolly**

As he was saying this, the door opened and a

voice shouted out, “Well, I’m glad to hear that,

Brendan, for we’ve no plans to go back!”





Uncle Brendan’s face burst into a huge grin.

“Michael Connolly!” he exclaimed. Turning,

he saw his old neighbors from Ireland walking



through the door. They were new immigrants to the United States now. After

a happy reunion, Brendan said, “Sit down, all, and we’ll bring you a good,

warm meal.” Later, after the Connolly family was full of Cathleen’s hearty

food, Brendan asked Michael, “Have you a place to stay? And what are you

doing about work?”


“We are staying with my brother for now,” his old neighbor replied. “As for

work . . .” He shrugged.


“I’d hire you myself,” Brendan said, “but I couldn’t **afford** to pay you. ~~_If_~~

~~_Brendan couldn’t afford to pay Michael, that means he didn’t have enough_~~

~~_money or wouldn’t be able to pay Michael for his work if he gave him a job._~~ But

there’s a fellow here from the old country who needs wagon drivers to deliver

ice in the summer and coal for fires in the winter. No man alive knows more

about horses than you do, Michael. I’ll take you to meet him. It’s hard work,

but what isn’t? At least you’ll be near your new home—not like my brother,

Peter, out West laying railroad track with a pick and a shovel.”


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


**Show Image 4A-6: Sean, Fiona, and Uncle**
**Brendan at table**

At this, his niece, Fiona, said, “But not for long,

Uncle. That’s what I was starting to tell you. We

got a letter. Pa says his boss thinks so highly

of his work that he’s bringing him back to New

York City to work in an office!”


Her brother, Sean, added, “Pa will be home at



the end of the month. He says that it’s a lucky thing he can read and write,

or he would not have been given this new job opportunity. He says it will pay

better than building the railroad out West. What’s even better is that now he

will be close to home to care for Ma. You should have seen her face when I

read her the letter. I think maybe she’ll get better now with Pa around.”


Uncle Brendan nodded. “Aye, Sean, when your pa is around, your mother

perks up like a flower that just got watered. And see how important it is that

you and Fiona learned to read and write so well at an early age! One day

you’ll have better job opportunities than any of us.”


**Show Image 4A-7: Sean and Uncle Brendan**
**shaking hands**

Sean smiled. “Fiona and I are very lucky now to

live here in the land of opportunity, but we will

never forget where we came from and what

sacrifices our family had to make to get here.”





~~_How does Sean feel about immigrating to the_~~

~~_United States?_~~



“Well,” said Uncle Brendan, “It seems we all have a great deal to be grateful

for here in America. Cathleen and I are lucky enough to own a restaurant; the

Connollys are newcomers here; my brother will be with us soon, and working in

a better job; and I believe your ma will get better, children. All in all, I’d say that

as hard as the changes sometimes are, coming to America was a good idea.”

_(Ireland)_ Where did they immigrate to? _(America)_


2. Inferential. What push factors caused Sean and Fiona, their family, and
many other Irish families to leave Ireland? _(the potato blight; they did not_
_have enough to eat or enough money in Ireland)_


3. Inferential. What pull factors brought the Murphys to the United States?
_(hope for a better life; better job opportunities; more money for their work; etc.)_


4. Inferential. How were Uncle Brendan and Fiona’s father, Peter, able to make
a living in the United States? _(by owning a restaurant and working on the_
_railroad out West)_


5. Evaluative. Why do you think the Murphys settled in New York City?
_(because there were other Irish immigrants there; it was close to Ellis_
_Island; etc.)_


6. Inferential. What is the theme of the Read-Aloud? _(Answers may vary but_
_could include that it is important to remember where you came from, be_
_thankful for the opportunities that come to you, or even when things are_
_difficult, keep going.)_


Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** Why did both Aunt Cathleen and Sean call
the United States a “land of opportunity”? _(There was more_
_food in the United States than in Ireland; there were more job_
_opportunities; Fiona and Sean will have better opportunities in_
_their future; etc.)_


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


~~**WORD WORK: AFFORD (5 MIN.)**~~


In the Read-Aloud you heard, “I’d hire you myself’, Brendan said, ‘but I
couldn’t afford to pay you.”


1. Say the word _afford_ with me.


2. To afford means to have enough of something, especially money or time,
available to buy or do something.


3. After practicing for several months for a concert, Mary could afford a few
days without practice when she was sick.


4. Have you ever been able to afford to do something? Try to use the word
_afford_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide
and/or rephrase the students’ responses: “I could afford to . . .”]


5. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I am going to read several
sentences. If the person in the sentence has enough time or money available
to do or buy something, say, “They could afford .” If the person in the
sentence is not able to afford something, or does not have enough money or
time for something, say, “They could not afford .”


1. Penny had enough money for a sandwich and a lollipop. _(She could afford the_
_sandwich and lollipop.)_


2. Graham wanted new seeds for his garden but did not have enough money.
_(He could not afford the new seeds.)_


3. Luke had already missed four days of school, and if he missed another he
would not do well on his first test. _(He could not afford to miss another day_
_of school.)_


4. Leslie was very good at soccer, so her coach was not worried when she
needed to miss one practice. _(She could afford to miss one practice.)_


5. The school bought eight new computers with the money they had saved.
_(The school could afford the new computers.)_

**Note:** There may be variations in the sentences created by your class.
Allow for these variations and restate students’ sentences so that they are
grammatically correct.


  - Remind students what a noun is and explain to students what adjectives are.

    - What is a noun? _(A noun is a person, place, or thing.)_

    - Today we will practice using adjectives, which are words or phrases that
are used to describe nouns.


**Show Image 4A-2**

  - Ask students to describe the image.

    - Describe this image to your partner. I will call on a few of you to share.


  - As students share, repeat what they say and put emphasis on the adjectives
and adjective phrases, e.g., It is _cold_ ; the wind was _freezing_ ; the girl with a _red_
scarf on her head walks with her brother on the _busy_ street; the boy wearing
the _brown_ hat opens the _green_ door. After each example, remind students
that adjectives describe nouns.


  - Reread a sentence from the Read-Aloud and help students identify the
adjectives used.


_It was a freezing cold day in 1858, and all those bodies helped block the_
_powerful wind blowing in from the Hudson River._


    - What kind of day was it? _(It was a freezing cold day.)_

    - What adjectives are used to describe the day? _(freezing_ and _cold)_

    - What was the wind like? _(The wind was powerful.)_

    - What is the adjective used to describe the wind? _(powerful)_


**TEKS 2.11.D.iv** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including adjectives, including articles; **TEKS 2.6.G** Evaluate
details read to determine key ideas; **TEKS 2.7.B** Write brief comments on literary or informational texts that demonstrate an
understanding of the text.


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


 - Encourage students to use adjectives in their own sentences:


   - Now you try! Tell your partner the temperature or weather for today. You
can say, “Today is a day.” Then continue to describe what the day is
like using more adjectives.


 - Have students write two sentences without adjectives. Then, have students
share those sentences with a partner. Each partner will add adjectives
to their partner’s sentences. Call on a few students to share the original
sentences and new sentences with the class.


~~**E PLURIBUS UNUM PUZZLE (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask students the meaning of the phrase _e pluribus unum._ _(“out of many, one”)_


 - Remind students that this was a good motto for the United States because
many different immigrants have come to the United States and made
America one great country.


 - Tell students that they are going to write on another puzzle piece to
help them remember some of the important things they learned about
immigration to the United States.


 - On Activity Page 4.1, have students write one to three sentences describing
life for Irish immigrants. Tell students they may focus on why Irish people
emigrated from Ireland or they may focus on their lives once they got to the
United States. Encourage students to use details from today’s Read-Aloud.


Check for Understanding


**Circulate and Ask:** Circulate and guide students as they write
about Irish immigrants in the United States.


 - If students have additional time, they may illustrate the puzzle piece as well.

One day in 1858, Lin Wen hurried down the

steep stairway and out onto the street that cut

through his neighborhood in San Francisco,

California. Lin Wen’s neighborhood in San







Francisco was called “Chinatown” because it

was the area of town where many immigrants

from China settled.

**Show Image 5A-3: Lin Wen and his father**

Lin Wen and his father traveled to America,

hoping to make a better life for themselves and

their family. In China, their family, along with



Image Card 4





many other Chinese families, was very poor.

It was hard for Lin Wen’s father to support his



family. He decided to take Lin Wen to America and search for gold. ~~_[Show Image_~~

~~_5A-3, and then show Image Card 4 to gain another perspective of Angel Island.]_~~


They had come on a great steamship, leaving behind Lin Wen’s mother, his

two sisters, and his grandmother in China. On the journey to the United

States, Lin Wen’s father had told him, “We will make enough money to bring

over the rest of our family, too.” ~~_What push and pull factors brought Lin Wen_~~

~~_and his father to the United States?_~~


**Show Image 5A-4: European Americans**
**talking about Lin Wen and his father**

Lin Wen and his father faced many challenges

after going through the immigration center

on Angel Island. They discovered that life in

the United States was not as easy as they had





expected it to be. Chinese immigrants, like

Lin Wen and his father, experienced feeling



unwelcomed and unaccepted by many Americans in California. The few jobs

Chinese immigrants were allowed to do were often hard and dangerous, such

as helping to build the railroad that would cross the continent and link the

eastern and western sections of the United States. Some Irish immigrants

also helped build that historic railroad. ~~_Who did we hear about who emigrated_~~

Other Chinese immigrants took jobs working long, **exhausting** ~~_or extremely_~~

working in laundries where the clothes were washed in large wooden kettles

of boiling water. ~~_These jobs required the workers to start in the early morning_~~

Americans who were neither welcoming nor accepting of Chinese immigrants

did not like how the Chinese had very different traditions and customs from

Americans. Although, some Americans realized how difficult a new life in

America could be for the newcomers. Many Americans were welcoming and

kind to the many different immigrants in the United States.


**Show Image 5A-5: Lin Wen walking through**
**Chinatown**

Lin Wen and his father never got as far as the

gold mines or the mountains, and they quickly

learned that it was not as easy to find gold as

they had heard. They ended up in Chinatown





where Lin Wen’s father worked in a laundry

and Lin Wen was lucky enough to work in



a grocery store selling traditional Chinese foods. Lin Wen was on his way

to work now, but he had a stop to make first. Winding his way through the

streets, he followed a side street to a small door. After passing through it, he

climbed some stairs and entered a room.


**Show Image 5A-6: Lin Wen and shopkeeper**

No one would have guessed from the street

that this rundown building could hold such

a beautiful room. Hanging on the walls were

red silk cloths bearing gold-colored Chinese

**characters** ~~_or writing symbols_~~ . On the floors





were plush, silk cushions, and the air was

fragrant with the sweet smell of incense—

wood that, when burned, filled the place with a

smell like flowers.


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


An old Chinese man nodded a welcome. He asked, “You are here to **honor**

~~_or show respect for_~~ the memory of your grandfather?”


“Yes, please,” Lin Wen answered. Remembering a person’s ancestors was—

and still is—an important Chinese belief. “We owe our being here to those

who came before us,” Lin Wen’s father had taught him. “One way to show our

respect is to say special prayers and burn incense in their memory.” ~~_Sticks_~~

~~_of incense are made from a material that burns slowly and produces a sweet_~~

~~_and pleasant smell._~~ Lin Wen’s grandfather had died long before Lin Wen and

his father had come to America, but they continued to honor him. Lin Wen

bought a thin stick of incense from the old man, lit the end of it with a match,

and said a few prayers. Afterward, he thanked the old man and continued on

his way to work.


**Show Image 5A-7: Mr. Wong, Lin Wen’s father,**
**and Lin Wen at the market**

The market was crowded with shoppers

buying ducks, chickens, vegetables, rice, and

other produce for traditional Chinese recipes.

The owner of the market, Mr. Wong, had known





Lin Wen’s family back in China. After arriving

in San Francisco, Lin Wen and his father had



gone to see their old friend Mr. Wong, who said, “I can hire you or your son to

work in my store.”


Lin Wen’s father had answered, “This is an act of great kindness, my friend.

Let my son work with you. Another friend has offered us a job at his laundry.

I will take that job because it will be more demanding, and that way my son

will have some time to study and learn.”


Lesson 5 A Promising Future
**69**


**Show Image 5A-8: Lin Wen’s father urging**
**him to get a good education**

At the time, Lin Wen had said nothing, but that

night, he had quietly asked his father, “Father,

should I not respect you as the head of our

family? Yet, you will not let me take seriously

the **responsibilities** ~~_or things I am counted on_~~

~~_to do_~~ for our family that you have taught me



are mine. I should take the job in the laundry. I am young and strong; it will

be easy for me to work the long hours there. You should work in the grocery.”

~~_Why did Lin Wen’s father want his son to work at the grocery rather than the_~~

~~_laundry?_~~


Lin Wen’s father said, “Lin Wen, the only thing as important as respecting

your elders is getting an education. If you work in the laundry, you will

not have time to study and educate yourself. That is also one of your

responsibilities. I have made my decision, but your offer to work in the

laundry means a great deal to me. I hope that someday we will have enough

money so that we can bring our family here. But even if we never make a

lot of money, I know now that I am a rich man, for I have something more

valuable than gold: a son of whom I am very proud.”


**Show Image 5A-9: Lin Wen talking to**
**customer**

Remembering this moment, Lin Wen smiled

as he was selling spices to a customer. She

noticed Lin Wen’s smile. “Why are you so

happy today?” she asked, handing him her





money. “This market is not exactly ‘Gold

Mountain’, you know.”

“Perhaps it is,” Lin Wen answered. And he smiled as he handed back her

change.

_and other Chinese immigrants to the United States.)_


3. Literal. What kinds of jobs did many Chinese immigrants have? _(dangerous_
_and difficult jobs; jobs in woolen mills, laundries; building railroads; etc.)_

immigrants to the United States came in search of a better life. These
immigrants might have said to each other once they landed, “Now, we can
turn over a new leaf.”


  - Tell students the saying “turn over a new leaf” means to make a fresh start.
This saying can also mean to make an important change in the way you act.


  - Have the students repeat the saying.


  - Ask students if they can think of any situations when they might use this
saying. Ask if they have ever turned over a new leaf. For example, “My room
is usually very messy, but I’ve turned over a new leaf. I clean my room every
day now!”

~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED? (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Read the title of today’s Read-Aloud, “A Land of Opportunity,” to students.
Remind students they have heard this phrase before by rereading selections
from previous Read-Alouds.


From “Charles Steinmetz Comes to America”:


_His friend Oscar understood. He explained in later years, “Like so_
_many others, Steinmetz came to America so he could help others with_
_his talents and also have a good job and life for himself. That is why_
_they call the United States the ‘land of opportunity.’” Like many other_
_immigrants, the move to America gave Charles a new chance to achieve_
_something._


From “From Ireland to New York City”:


_Sean smiled. “Fiona and I are very lucky now to live here in the land of_
_opportunity, but we will never forget where we came from and what_
_sacrifices our family had to make to get here.”_


_“Well,” said Uncle Brendan, “It seems we all have a great deal to be_
_grateful for here in America. Cathleen and I are lucky enough to own_
_a restaurant; the Connollys are newcomers here; my brother will be_
_with us soon, and working in a better job; and I believe your ma will get_
_better, children. All in all, I’d say that as hard as the changes sometimes_
_are, coming to America was a good idea.”_

Lars and Karin Andersson looked out over the

field. The rich, dark brown soil of Wisconsin

reminded them of the best farmland back

in Sweden. Lars knelt down and scooped up



read books. Somehow he knows if it is good or bad for growing crops.”


Now Lars stood up. “This is fine land,” he told his wife. She could hear

excitement in his voice. “Here we will grow wheat and corn. Over there,”

he said pointing, “we can raise dairy cows for milk and butter.” ~~_Is Lars_~~

~~_referring to the actual land made of dirt? Or, is Lars referring to the land of_~~

**Show Image 6A-2: Poor European farmers**

The Anderssons, like many other immigrants

who settled in the American Midwest, came

from Northern Europe. This means they

emigrated from countries like Germany,

Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and other

nearby European nations and moved to the

United States. ~~_[Ask a volunteer to point to_~~



~~_the countries mentioned on a world map.]_~~ These immigrants brought with

them their knowledge of farming and a strong sense of working together as

families and as neighbors.


Immigrants like the Anderssons came to the United States because they

could not own land in Europe. In Europe, kings and princes kept tight control

over who was allowed to buy and own land. People who were not friends of

the king, or of a rich nobleman or noblewoman whose family had owned land

for many years, had trouble buying farmland. Without owning farmland, it

was hard for many people in Northern Europe to make a living. ~~_How do you_~~

~~_think you might feel if you had to be friends with the king in order to own_~~

~~_land?_~~ Friends of the Anderssons who had already settled in Wisconsin and

nearby Minnesota had written letters back home to Sweden saying, “Join us

in America! Things are different here in the United States. Here you don’t

have to be the king’s friend to buy and own land; you just have to be willing to

work very hard.”


**Show Image 6A-3: Abraham Lincoln**

~~_Who is this U.S. president?_~~ During the

American Civil War, in 1862, the American

government under President Lincoln gave

huge amounts of government-controlled

land to homesteaders. A **homestead** is land





someone settles on to live and farm. ~~_So what_~~

~~_is a homesteader?_~~ ~~(a person who builds a~~



~~homestead)~~ The government made it easy for farmers to own as much as

160 acres of land, which was more than enough for a successful farm. ~~_One_~~

~~_acre of land is almost the same size as an American football field. Can you_~~

~~_imagine owning and farming 160 football fields worth of land?_~~ A homesteader

had to build a house on the land and farm the land for at least five years. At

the end of that time, for a fee of eighteen dollars, the person or family would

own the land **legally** ~~_or according to the law_~~ .

Remind students that
they learned about
Abraham Lincoln in
the _America: Our Great_
_Country_ unit (Grade
K). Ask students what
they remember about
President Lincoln or the
Homestead Act.



Lesson 6 A Land of Opportunity
**81**


Many different people could become homesteaders. For example, unmarried

men or women could become homesteaders. People coming to America as

immigrants could become homesteaders. The United States gave all sorts

of people a chance to own land and make a new life. Millions of people from

across the United States and immigrants from many other nations came

to the Midwest to lend their farming skills and worked hard to build up the

United States.


**Show Image 6A-4: Lars and Karin coming to**
**Wisconsin**

With the hope of owning land and making a

better life for themselves and their children,

Karin and Lars sold nearly everything they

owned in Sweden, bought tickets to America,





crossed the sea on a ship, and ended up

among the low, gently rolling hills of Wisconsin.



~~_Many people had to sell everything they owned in order to afford to immigrate_~~

~~_to the United States. [Ask a volunteer to point to Wisconsin on a U.S. map.]_~~

~~_What immigration center do you think they went through?_~~


Now that they had made it to Wisconsin, they had to decide what to do

with their land. Lars said to Karin, “We will leave that patch of forest for

now and start with the land that is already cleared. We will get a mule and

a plow to loosen the soil and get the land ready to plant. To afford this, we

will have to borrow some money and add that to the money we still have left

from Sweden.”


**Show Image 6A-5: Lars and Karin working on**
**their farm**

“And we will build a house,” Karin said. “It

doesn’t have to be a big one. We can add on

to it later when we’re more settled and have

earned more money.”





**82**



And that is what they did. All across the

Midwest of the United States, other immigrant

farmers were doing the same things—working hard and starting a new life.

Working long, hard hours, immigrants and other homesteaders turned the

American Midwest into some of the finest farmland on Earth, pitching in to

help one another through hard times, and sharing the joy of one another’s


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


successes in this new land. With the help of their neighbors, the Anderssons

built a house partly shaded by the trees they had decided to leave standing.

They built a barn and painted it red. They grew wheat and corn to sell, and

paid back the money they owed. They watched over every dollar they earned

and every penny they spent. In time, both the little house and their family

grew bigger. They now had a boy, Stefan, and two girls, Ingrid and Margareta.


**Show Image 6A-6: Family getting ready**

One day, five years after they arrived in the

United States and claimed their land, the

Anderssons were ready to pay their eighteen

dollars so that their land, along with their

house, barn, and farmland, would be theirs —





**officially** approved by those in charge. That

morning, the whole family took turns bathing



in the large metal tub in the kitchen, into which they poured warm water

heated on the stove. ~~_Remember, this story takes place in the late 1800s_~~

~~_before there were bathtubs and showers like we have today._~~ Because it was

such a special day, they dressed in their best clothes, which they usually

saved for church. Karin even dressed up little Margareta in her best outfit.

Then Lars said, “It is time. Everyone get into the wagon.” With a cry of “Git

up!” to the two mules he had hitched to the front of the wagon, Lars shook

the reins, and they started down the five miles of dirt road toward town. As

they passed each neighboring farm, the neighbors waved and called out,

“Congratulations, Karin!” or “We’re proud of you, Lars!” ~~_How do you think the_~~

~~_Anderssons felt?_~~ Karin and Lars waved back and smiled—they were grateful

their neighbors **supported** them.


**Show Image 6A-7: Mr. Ellgard congratulating**
**the family**

At last the Anderssons reached town. Lars

stopped the wagon in front of a government

building and helped Karin and the children

from the wagon. They walked inside and up to





the counter. Proudly, Lars told the clerk, “Good

morning, Mr. Ellgard. We have come to claim

our land.”

1. Evaluative. Were your predictions correct about how life for immigrants who
settled in the countryside was different than life in the city? Why or why not?
_(Answers may vary.)_


2. Literal. From where did Lars and Karin emigrate or leave? _(Sweden, in_
_Northern Europe)_


3. Literal. What pull factor brought Lars and Karin and other immigrants from
Northern Europe to the American Midwest? _(the opportunity to own their own_
_land for farming)_

   - Inferential. Why did Lars and Karin settle in the Midwest rather than in
a big city? _(They wanted to own their own land for farming and could not_
_farm in a big city in the United States.)_


4. Evaluative. Did this story take place long ago or is it a modern story? _(long_
_ago)_ How do you know? _(traveled in a wagon, bathed in a metal tub, etc.)_


Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** Is “A Land of Opportunity” a good title for this
Read-Aloud? Why or why not? _(Answers may vary but students_

6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Discussion activity for follow-up.** Another way to say you support
something or someone is to say you “give them support.” Turn to your
partner and tell him/her about a time you gave support to someone. Have
you ever done or said something to support someone else? You might say, “I
gave support to . . . when . . . ”. [Call on a few partners to share.]

**Show Poster 3M (Land)**

  - Using the poster, help students identify the three meanings of the word _land._


  - Tell students to refer to the numbers in their answers or to walk up to the
poster and point to the picture of meaning you are describing. Remind
students to speak clearly at an appropriate pace during class discussions.

    - In the Read-Aloud you heard Lars tell his wife, “This is fine land . . . here we
will grow wheat and corn. Over there we can raise dairy cows for milk and
butter.” Here _land_ means an area of ground. Which picture of _land_ matches
the way Lars uses it in his conversation with his wife? (1)

    - _Land_ can also mean other things, like a country or a nation. Which picture
matches this description of _land_ ? (2)

    - In addition, _land_ can mean to come down out of the air. For example, when
a plane is about to land on a runway, it lowers its landing gear. Which
picture matches this description of _land_ ? (3)


  - Have students work with a partner to create their own sentences using the
word _land._

    - Now with your neighbor, quiz each other on the different meanings of the
word. Think of an example of one of the uses of the word _land._ Remember
to be as descriptive as possible and use complete sentences. For example,
you could say, “It was interesting to watch the duck fly in and land on the
water.” And your neighbor should respond, “That’s ‘3.’” ~~**TEKS 2.1.C**~~


  - Review the meaning of _land_ in the phrase _land of opportunity._

    - In this Read-Aloud and throughout the unit, you have heard the phrase
_land of opportunity_ . Which definition do you think matches the way _land_ is
used in this phrase? In what ways is it like definition ‘1’? In what ways is it
like definition ‘2’?

many different immigrants have come to the United States and made
America one great country.


 - Tell students that they are going to write on another puzzle piece to
help them remember some of the important things they learned about
immigration to the United States.


 - On Activity Page 6.1, have students write one to three sentences describing
immigration. Tell students they may focus on why European people
immigrated to the Midwest or they may focus on their lives once they got to
the Midwest. Encourage students to use details from today’s Read-Aloud.

What are the people in this image doing? Are the people in these images
immigrants? How do you know? Then, in their groups, have students share
anything they learned in the Read-Alouds that connects to the Image Card in their
hands. You may once again need to prompt discussion by asking the following:


   - What were the names of the two immigration centers?


   - Which immigrants passed through Ellis Island? Angel Island?


   - Where did many new immigrants live?


   - Why did immigrants come to the United States?


   - What kinds of jobs did immigrants have in the city? In the countryside?


   - Were new immigrants always welcomed by Americans?


**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**


Materials: Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard

 - Give the students a key unit concept or vocabulary word such as
_immigration_ . Have them brainstorm everything that comes to mind when
they hear the word, such as push and pull factors, freedoms, opportunity,
etc. Record their responses on a piece of chart paper, a chalkboard, or a
whiteboard for reference.


**Somebody Wanted But So Then**

 - Explain to the students that they are going to retell the story of Charles
Steinmetz, first individually, and then together as a class. Tell students that
they are going to retell Charles’s story using Activity Page PP.5, a Somebody
Wanted But So Then Activity Page. Students who participated in the program
in Kindergarten and Grade 1 should be very familiar with this chart and will
have seen their Kindergarten and Grade 1 teachers model the exercise. Have

these students work in pairs to orally fill in the chart together while one
person acts as the scribe. If you have students who are new to the program,
you may wish to work with them individually or in a small group, guiding them
through this exercise.


 - If time allows, have students share their charts with the class. As they
recount the story, you may wish to refer back to Flip Book Images 2A-1–2A-8.
As students retell the Read-Aloud, make sure to use complete sentences and
unit-related vocabulary to expand upon their responses.


 - For your reference, completed charts should be similar to this example:

|Somebody|Charles|
|---|---|
|**Wanted**|to immigrate to the United States from Germany.|
|**But**|because Charles couldn’t speak English, didn’t have a job, and had no<br>money, the clerk wanted to send him back to Germany.|
|**So**|Charles’s friend Oscar told the clerk that Charles was very smart and<br>had many talents, and that he would pay for Charles’s way until he<br>found a job.|
|**Then**|the clerk let Charles into the United States. Charles made many<br>scientifc inventions and discoveries, worked with Thomas Edison, and<br>helped the United States with his talents.|



**Riddles for Core Content**

 - Ask students riddles such as the following to review core content:


   - I left my home country and settled in another country. Who am I?
_(an immigrant)_


   - I am an immigrant who came to the United States from China looking for
“Gold Mountain.” What immigration center did I go through? _(Angel Island)_


   - I welcomed immigrants whose ships came through New York Harbor to
America. I represent freedom and hope. What am I? _(the Statue of Liberty)_


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


   - I came to the United States because the potato blight made it difficult to
find food. Who am I? _(an Irish immigrant)_


   - I was almost turned away at Ellis Island because I did not have a job or
money, but I ended up being a great help in bringing electricity to more
people. Who am I? _(Charles Steinmetz)_


   - I am an immigrant who came to the United States from Europe looking for
a better life. What immigration center did I go through? _(Ellis Island)_


   - I am the Latin phrase that means “out of many, one.” What phrase am I? _(e_
_pluribus unum)_


   - I am a phrase that describes the many reasons people left their home
countries. What am I? _(push factors)_


   - I am a part of the United States that has a lot of open land. Homesteaders
built their homes and farmed here. What am I? _(the Midwest; Wisconsin;_
_Minnesota)_


   - I am the traditional ways of doing things, and include foods, decorations,
and celebrations from one’s homeland. What am I? _(customs)_


**Venn Diagram**

 - Tell students that they are going to use a Venn diagram to compare and
contrast some of the things they have learned thus far about immigration.
Remind them that to compare is to tell how people or objects are similar, and
to contrast is to tell how people or objects are different.


 - Write the following list on a piece of chart paper, a chalkboard, or a
whiteboard. Have students choose something from the list to compare and
contrast.


   - the lives of new immigrants in New York City and in the Midwest


   - Ellis Island and Angel Island


   - the Chinese immigrants and the Irish immigrants


   - push factors and pull factors


**Note:** You may wish to have students draw a picture to accompany their
diagram. For assessment, students should complete Activity Page PP.6
individually; however, you may wish to have students complete it in groups or
as a class.

**Class Book: Immigration**


Materials: Drawing paper, drawing tools

 - Tell the class or a group of students that they are going to make a class book
to help them remember what they have learned thus far in this unit. Have
the students brainstorm important information about the following: why people
immigrate; Charles Steinmetz; Ellis Island and Angel Island; life in the city
as an immigrant; life in the Midwest as an immigrant; and the challenges of
immigration. Have each student choose one idea to draw a picture of, and ask
them to write a caption for the picture. Bind the pages to make a book to put
in the class library for students to read again and again. You may choose to add
more pages upon completion of the entire unit before binding the book.


**Machina: Out of Many, One**

 - To reinforce the Latin phrase _e pluribus unum_ (“out of many, one”) tell
students that they are going to create a fictional machine, which we will call
a _machina_, the Latin word for _machine_ . Tell students that they are going to
be the parts of this machine. Have students decide what the machine will do
and discuss how they all come together as many parts to make one working
machine—out of many, one. You may also want to apply this motto to your
class, telling students that out of many students from different families and
different neighborhoods, one classroom community is formed.


**Research Activity: Ellis Island and Angel Island**


Materials: Image Cards 2 and 3

 - Review with students what they have already learned about Ellis Island and
Angel Island. Remind students that both Ellis Island and Angel Island are no
longer used as immigration centers. Both are now museums that the public
may visit to better educate themselves about the history of immigration to
the United States.


 - If students have any further questions about either one of these historical
immigration centers, you may want to provide students with an opportunity
to do research.


 - You may do this research as a class or have students do their research
individually. Encourage students to present their findings to a group of
students or to the class.


 - Make sure to reinforce unit-specific vocabulary whenever possible as
students conduct their research.


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity

**Research Activity: The Statue of Liberty**

 - Remind students that they have heard a lot about the Statue of Liberty and
what a hopeful sight it was for the many immigrants who passed through Ellis
Island. Show students Image Card 1 and Flip Book Images 1A-7, 2A-1, and 2A4, where the Statue of Liberty appears. If students are interested, have them
research some facts about the history of the Statue of Liberty. As a starting
point, you may wish to look for nonfiction books about the Statue of Liberty.


 - Additionally, you may have students create their own writing about the
Statue of Liberty and the hope it gave immigrants arriving in New York after
their long journey. Make sure to reinforce unit concepts and unit-specific
vocabulary throughout this activity.


**Writing Prompts**

 - Students may be given an additional writing prompt such as the following:


   - People immigrate to the United States because . . .


   - The day I landed at Ellis Island . . .


   - The day that I first saw the Statue of Liberty . . .

- Tell students that today’s Read-Aloud is about a family from Mexico who
immigrated to San Antonio, Texas. Make sure students know that Texas has
been part of the United States since 1845, but before 1836, Texas was part
of Mexico, and before that, part of the Spanish Empire. Many families living
in San Antonio have lived there for a very long time, some since San Antonio
was part of Mexico and even Spain.


- This story is set in the early 1900s. In the early 1900s, San Antonio was the

~~**“A NEW LIFE IN TEXAS” (25 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 7A-1: The Hernandez family**

It was 1917, and the Hernandez family had to

make a decision. It was not a small decision,

like what to have for dinner or which game

to play at recess. It was a big decision. The

Hernandez family had to decide whether to





leave everything they knew and loved in their

home country of Mexico and move to the



United States. It was a decision they did not take lightly. They knew if they

made this move it would be life-changing, and they believed that would mean

life-changing in a positive way.


**Show Image 7A-2: The Mexican Revolution**

There are many different reasons why a family,

like the Hernandez family, might **immigrate** to

the United States. Some may come to find a

better job. Others may move here for freedom,

or even for something as simple as to get





enough food. At the time the Hernandez family

was making this decision, it was because

of challenges caused by the Mexican **Revolution** . In the early 1900s, the

Mexican Revolution took place in their homeland, Mexico. There were people

who disagreed with the president, Porfirio Díaz, a Mexican **dictator** who had

been in power for many years. The revolution started for that reason and

lasted almost ten years. During that time, Mexico had many different leaders.


Check for Understanding


What is a revolution?


_(Sample answer: A revolution is when people decide to end the_
_current government and create a new one. This happens when_
_people disagree with a leader and remove them from power.)_


**Show Image 7A-3: Monterrey and**

**San Antonio**

The Mexican Revolution was difficult for the

people who lived there. There was fighting

because many people wanted a change in the

Mexican government. They wanted to see a





new leader, and many people lost their lives

fighting for this cause. All of the fighting also



**100**



made it difficult for people to get what they needed to live. It was challenging

for people living in Mexico to find work or even get food to eat.


For many years, Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez owned a bakery, or _panadería_ .

However, due to the revolution, the rising costs of goods, and losing

customers, they could no longer remain open. Therefore, the Hernandez

family made the decision to move to the United States. They knew that the

United States was the “land of opportunity,” and even though it would be

difficult to start all over, they knew that all of the hard work would secure a

better future for their family. Mr. Hernandez decided they would move from

Monterrey, Mexico, to San Antonio, Texas. He knew there was a Mexican

community in San Antonio already, with some families who had lived in

San Antonio since before the city was part of the United States, so there

would be people who would speak the same language as them. The familiar

community could also help them get settled and find jobs.


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


Check for Understanding


What are the push factors that made the Hernandez family decide
to leave Mexico and immigrate to the United States?


_(The push factors included needing a job, money, food, and trouble_
_in their home government. Specifically for the Hernandez family,_
_Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez had to close their bakery due to the_
_ongoing Mexican Revolution. Because they did not have jobs, this_
_resulted in them not being able to afford food, clothing, etc. They_
_decided to move to the United States for a chance at a better life.)_


**Show Image 7A-4: Preparing to leave**

The family knew this would be a big journey for

them. Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez started packing

up their most important **belongings** . They

knew they could not take too much with them,



Support


Over the course of the
Read-Aloud, use a map
of the southwestern
United States and
Mexico to trace the
Hernandezes’ journey
from Monterrey to San
Antonio. Tell students
that this journey is
approximately 300
miles. Today, a journey
of this length would
take approximately
five hours by car, but
it would have taken at
least twelve hours by
train in the early 1900s.





as they would be traveling by train and there

was little space. Although Mr. Hernandez knew

this would be a difficult trip for his family,



he believed that they would be able to start a new life in the United States.

He double-checked the side pocket of his suitcase to make sure he had the

money needed for the tax fee and all of the family’s identification papers.

Then he clasped the bag shut.


Mr. Hernandez began to worry about Juana, his ten-year-old daughter, who

was not packing even though she was told to do so.


**Show Image 7A-5: A difficult decision**

“Juana, I’ve told you already,” said Mr.

Hernandez. “We have to pack up! We are

leaving tomorrow, and I want to be sure we

have everything together before we have to

head to the train station.”


Juana looked at her father with tears in her

eyes. “I know life has changed here, but I still like going to school and learning.

How will I do that in a new country with a different language? What is the name

of the place where we will live, anyway?” she asked.


Lesson 7 A New Life in Texas
**101**


**102**



“We are moving to San Antonio, Texas. This is a city where many families from

Mexico have settled and made their home. You will go to school and continue

to learn. It will take time, but we will do it, Juana,” Mr. Hernandez assured her.


Juana looked at her father and knew it was time to start packing. She started

sorting through her belongings and deciding what to take. Soon, her suitcase was

filled, and it was time to get some sleep before the big trip to the United States.


Check for Understanding


Why do you think Juana had not started packing?


_(Juana was nervous and unsure about the trip, so she was trying to_
_avoid the trip by not packing.)_


**Show Image 7A-6: The journey begins**

The trip was long and tiring. When the train

crossed the border into the United States,

the Hernandez family breathed a sigh of

relief. They made it! Before boarding another

train for San Antonio, they had to show their

papers, pay a tax, and take a literacy test.

Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez had to read a short

paragraph in their home language to prove they could read. Once they were

approved, the last leg of their journey could begin. Finally, Mr. Hernandez

said, “We are here! This is San Antonio. Now we need to find a place to live.”

He knew of some families who had moved to San Antonio before him, so he

set out to look for them. Luckily, Mr. Hernandez found a family that he knew,

and they helped the Hernandez family get set up with a small place to live.

Mr. Hernandez was even able to find a job in a bakery, **assisting** with baking

breads and pastries like he did back in Mexico.


Check for Understanding


Do you think this was an easy journey to make? Why or why not?


_(Sample answer: I do not think this was an easy journey because_
_the family had to travel for a very long time. It was also a difficult_
_journey to make because they were leaving their entire lives_
_behind: friends, family, their home.)_


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


**Show Image 7A-7: Learning for all**

Juana was able to start school. The first day

was scary. She did meet some other children

who had moved to Texas from Mexico, like she

had. She was happy to be able to speak with

some students and was surprised to hear other

languages being spoken in her classroom.

However, Juana felt it was important to learn



English so she could communicate with other students in the class. **Academics**

were also important to Juana. She used the English words she learned in class

to practice at home with her parents. Each day, Juana would teach her parents

something new she learned at school. Eventually, Juana’s parents began to learn

some of the English words as well. They were all learning English together.


**Show Image 7A-8: Building community**

Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez were happy that

they were in a community where many other

immigrants from Mexico lived. It made it easier

to make friends and to be understood when

shopping. Juana continued to learn English and

would teach what she learned to her family. Mr.

Hernandez continued working at the bakery and



dreamed, along with his wife, of starting their own bakery as they did before in

Mexico. They knew it would take time, but they were optimistic about the future.

Life in the United States was challenging as immigrants, but the family knew it

was worth it when they remembered the challenges of life in Mexico.


**Show Image 7A-9: A new life**

As time went on, the Hernandez family settled

into their neighborhood in San Antonio. In this

Mexican American community, they were able

to have the comforts of neighbors who spoke

Spanish, ate many of the same foods, and





had many of the same traditions as they did

back in Mexico. As Juana continued in school,



the family continued to learn English. Juana was happy to have many friends

who immigrated from Mexico as she had. They understood her story and, like

Juana, were excited to continue their stories here in their new home in the

United States as Americans. Mr. Hernandez even achieved his dream of a new

bakery, and everyone in the community enjoyed his delicious baked goods.

3. Evaluative. Summarize why the Hernandez family immigrated to the United
States. _(The Hernandez family decided to move from Monterrey, Mexico, to_
_San Antonio, Texas, because life was very hard for them in Mexico due to the_

~~**“A MELTING POT” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 8A-1: The many faces of**
**immigrant ancestors**

The United States is a nation of immigrants.

Many of the people who live in the United

States today left their homelands in other

countries to come to America. Those who are





not immigrants themselves can probably point

to ancestors who came to the United States



as immigrants in earlier times. Some can point to a mother or father who

immigrated to the United States. They might have a grandparent or great
grandparent who came to the United States as an immigrant. Others have to

reach back a little farther in their family’s history. ~~_How does this image help the_~~

~~_reader support the idea that there are “many faces of immigrant ancestors”?_~~


**Show Image 8A-2: Native Americans today**

The people who have lived in North America

the longest are the Native Americans. Their

ancestors are the first known people to live

in what is now called the United States. They

made their way from Asia into North America





thousands of years ago. The Native Americans

spread out across North and South America. Today many Native American

**descendants** live all across the United States. ~~_Descendants are people who_~~

~~_are born after, or much later than, their ancestors. Ancestors are the relatives_~~

~~_who came before, or long ago._~~


**Show Image 8A-3: Early European**

**immigrants**

For many years the people of Europe did not

know that the Americas existed. Europe and

the Americas were two separate worlds. The

voyages of Christopher Columbus in 1492





changed that. After these voyages, Europeans

began to settle in the Native American lands of

North and South America.



The earliest immigrants came from a handful of countries in Northern

Europe. Many came from England and Scotland. But there were **settlers**

from other countries as well. Some came from France and Spain. Others

came from Germany and the Netherlands. They settled down and made their

homes in this new land called America. Many of the early settlers who fought

in the Revolutionary War ~~_in which America fought for its independence from_~~

~~_England_~~ could point to ancestors from one of these six countries. ~~_What is the_~~

~~_central idea represented by the map in this image?_~~


Later, immigrants began to come to the United States from other countries

in Europe. And, later still, they began to arrive from many other parts of

the world.


Why do people become immigrants? Why do they leave the countries where

they were born? And why have so many been drawn to the United States?

Usually there is something that pushes immigrants out of their homelands.

And usually there is something that pulls them to the United States. ~~_What_~~

~~_is the name for the reasons that immigrants leave their homeland and go to_~~

~~_another country?_~~ ~~(push and pull factors)~~


**Show Image 8A-4: Pilgrims**

The Pilgrims who came to New England in the

1600s felt both pushed out of their homeland

and pulled to the United States (although it





wasn’t called the United States at the time).


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity



**112**


They were pushed to leave England because the English king would not

allow them to practice their religion in the way that seemed best to them.

They were pulled to North America because they believed they would have

religious freedom there.


**Show Image 8A-5: Scottish and Irish**

**immigrants**

The Scottish people who came to America in

the late 1700s also felt push and pull factors.

Many of them were pushed off the land they

farmed by the landowners who wanted to use





the land to raise sheep. They were pulled to

the American colonies because in America

they could get farmland of their own.



Many of the Irish who came to the United States in the 1840s and ’50s came

because of a **famine** ~~_or great shortage of food_~~ in Ireland. All across Ireland,

potatoes went bad. They turned black and shriveled up. They were not good

to eat, and many Irish starved. Many were pushed out of their homeland by

the famine. The Irish heard there were farms and jobs in the United States.

These stories helped pull them to the United States.


**Show Image 8A-6: Chinese immigrants**

Many of the Chinese immigrants who came

to the United States in the 1840s and ’50s

were pushed out of their homeland because

they were poor. Some were pulled to the

United States by the prospect, or possibility,





of finding gold in the mountains of California.

Others were drawn here by jobs building

railroads.



Most of these immigrants saw America as a land of opportunity. It was a

place where Separatists had the opportunity to practice their religion in their

own way. It was a place where the Irish would have an opportunity to work on

the railroads or work in their communities in other jobs. Many groups were

able to own their own land and provide for their families. ~~_What kinds of things_~~

~~_do you think immigrants wanted to provide for their families?_~~


Lesson 8 A Melting Pot
**113**


**Show Image 8A-7: Modern immigrants from**

**all over the world**

Today, immigrants continue to come to the

United States from all over the world, from

countries such as Mexico, China, India, the

Philippines, the Dominican Republic, and

Ethiopia. Based on census information,

around a million immigrants arrive each year



from these and many other countries. That is about three or four thousand

people every day. This Read-Aloud will last about fifteen minutes. By the

time it is finished, thirty or forty people will have immigrated to the United

States. ~~_What is the central idea represented by the map in this image? How_~~

~~_does this image help the reader better understand the Read-Aloud?_~~


Today’s immigrants no longer come into the United States through Ellis

Island and Angel Island. Some arrive by plane, some by ship, some by bus or

car, and some may even walk.


**Show Image 8A-8: At work in our**

**communities**

Many people leave their homelands because

they are not able to live and work in safe and

healthy conditions. Some people must leave

their countries because of problems in the





government or the dangers of war. People all

around the world continue to view the United



**114**



States as a land of opportunity. They see the United States as a place where

people can make a new start in life—they can get an education, find jobs and

medical care, and create a new home for themselves and their families. They

can contribute their skills and hard work to the communities in which they live.


As in the past, new immigrants still face challenges, or difficulties, in

their new country. ~~_What challenges have you heard about in this unit that_~~

~~_immigrants sometimes face?_~~ Today’s immigrants must still say good- bye

to loved ones in their homelands and make new friends in the United

States. It takes time to become familiar with new ways of living—the food,

the language, the weather, and ways of getting around may be different.

Sometimes immigrants can use help getting used to a new life.


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


**Show Image 8A-9: A celebration from**

**another country**

It is still common for immigrants to settle in

cities. Many immigrants move to places where

others from their homelands have settled

and can help the newcomers find jobs and

places to live. Here, they can continue to share

familiar customs and traditions even as they



learn other ways of doing things in their new country. In this way, new and

delicious foods are introduced. People can enjoy a variety of festivals and

traditions from other countries. New forms of art and music become part of

our communities. Workers bring new ideas and skills to their places of work.

~~_Do you know any songs or foods that come from another country?_~~


**Show Image 8A-10: E pluribus unum on**

**a nickel**

This is a nickel. Do you see the words on top

of the nickel? They say _e pluribus unum_ . ~~_[Ask_~~

~~_students to repeat this phrase with you.]_~~ That

is a phrase from the Latin language. It means,





“out of many, one.” One of the powerful ideas

about the United States is that it is a country



where people from many different countries join together and form one

nation. From many, one.


You can think of the United States as a **melting pot** of people from many

different countries. The place where people come from is an important part

of who they are. Each person brings interesting customs, new talents and

ideas, and hard work to the pot. Like the ingredients of a stew, each person

contributes to making one nation. From many, to one. ~~_[Show Image Card 9_~~

~~_(Stew).] How is this stew like the phrase “from many, one”?_~~


**Show Image 8A-11: Postcards from the**

There are many songs that celebrate the unity,

or oneness, of the American people. One of

them is “This Land Is Your Land,” by Woody

Guthrie. You may know some of the words to

_This land is your land, this land is my land._
_From California to the New York Island,_
_From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters,_
_This land was made for you and me._


California and the Redwood Forest are on the West Coast. New York and the

Gulf Stream waters are on the East Coast. Most of America lies in between.

Woody Guthrie was trying to say that the land belongs to all Americans. It

is not just my country; it is also your country, wherever you may live in the

United States, and also wherever your ancestors may have come from.


**Show Image 8A-12: Melting pot of modern**

**immigrants**

From the earliest Native Americans and those

ancestors who came long ago from other

continents such as Europe, Africa, and Asia

throughout history until today, people have

come to the land that is now the United States

and have become citizens for many reasons.

Many people who live in the United States today are immigrants themselves.

Others have parents or grandparents who were immigrants. Still others have

ancestors whom they never knew who immigrated to America long ago. More

than almost anywhere else on Planet Earth, the United States is a nation of

immigrants and their descendants—a beautiful melting pot of people who

have come to America from all over the world. ~~_How does this image support_~~

~~**POSTMARKED FROM AMERICA: PLAN A LETTER**~~


  - Remind students that they have learned a lot about different immigrant
groups and their journeys. Ask them to name some push and pull factors
that have brought immigrants to the United States. Ask students to briefly
describe the life of immigrants in the United States.


  - Tell students that they are going to pretend they are immigrants living in
the United States and are writing letters back home. This letter will be
postmarked from the United States and will tell people in their homeland
what life is like in the United States.


  - Share with students that a postmark is a standard mark made by a rubber
stamp or machine on the envelope of a letter that says from where and when
the letter was mailed.


  - Tell students that before they begin to write, they must do the first step in the
writing process. Ask students what this is. _(plan)_


  - Give students Activity Page 8.1 to help them plan, or brainstorm, some things
they might say in the letter. Read the different labels on Activity Page 8.1
aloud to students. Tell students to first think about the city/neighborhood
where they might live (e.g., New York). Then, tell students to think about the
work they might do (e.g., work in a restaurant or grocery).


  - Once students have chosen those two things, encourage them to write
descriptively about the sights they might see and the feelings they might
have as new immigrants based on their city and job.

Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Application**

  - Create a mailbox out of a cardboard box for students to pretend to mail
their letters.


**Note to Teacher**

  - Note that immigration and citizenship today may be a sensitive topic for
some students. Be sure to review the content of today’s lesson ahead of
time and be sensitive to the citizenship status of your students and their
family members.


**Universal Access**

  - Students will learn that a citizen of a country is a person who has rights that
are protected by the government and who also has responsibilities to their
country. Students will hear the words _rights_ and _responsibilities_ throughout
this lesson. These words will be more clearly defined in Lessons 10 and 11.
Provide examples that students can relate to when describing these words.
For example, in the United States, citizens have the right, or freedom, to
choose their religion. This right was what attracted the Pilgrims to come to
North America from England. In the United States, citizens have the right
or freedom to say or write about their opinions, even if those opinions are
negative. This was a right Charles Steinmetz did not have in Germany, so
he immigrated to the United States. In the United States, citizens also have
responsibilities. For example, citizens have the responsibility, or duty and job,
to obey the laws of the country.


  - You may wish to show students a short video of a naturalization ceremony.
Find and preview a video appropriate for students. A few videos of
[naturalization ceremonies can be found using this link: https://www.uscis.](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/video-and-photo-gallery)
[gov/newsroom/video-and-photo-gallery.](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/video-and-photo-gallery)


  - Create an example of a letter “postmarked from the United States” by writing
a letter and placing it in an addressed envelope. Students may reference this
letter as an example when writing their own letters. You may wish to compose
the letter on a copy of Activity Page 9.1.

~~**CORE VOCABULARY**~~


**citizen, n.** a person who has rights given to them by a country’s government
and has responsibilities that go along with those rights

Example: I am proud to have been born in the United States and to be a
citizen of the United States.
Variation(s): citizens


**naturalized citizen, n.** someone who immigrates to a new country and, after
going through a process, becomes a citizen of that country
Example: Luca’s mother, who was born in Spain, became a naturalized
citizen of the United States and was then able to vote in her first
presidential election.
Variation(s): naturalized citizens


**principles, n.** general beliefs or rules
Example: Eating meat went against Becca’s principles as a vegetarian.
Variation(s): principle


**rights, n.** freedoms belonging to a person that the government cannot, and
should not, take away

  - Review with students what they have learned about immigration. You may
wish to ask the following questions to guide discussion:


    - What are some reasons, or push factors, that have pushed immigrants to
leave their homelands? _(Answers may vary, but may include: lack of jobs;_
_problems in the government; lack of freedom of speech and religion; etc.)_


    - What are some reasons, or pull factors, that have pulled immigrants to
come to the United States? _(Answers may vary, but may include: freedom_
_of speech and religion; better job opportunities; ability to own land; etc.)_


    - What was the immigration center through which many European
immigrants passed? _(Ellis Island)_ Where was it located? _(on the East_

~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION OR TERMS (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain to students that immigrants are protected by the Constitution, “the
law of the land,” as soon as they arrive in the United States. But, they do not
have a lot of the same benefits as the people born within the United States,
such as voting, until they become U.S. citizens.


 - Share with students that after immigrants have lived in the United States for
a while, they have the opportunity to become U.S. citizens.


 - Explain the meaning of the word _rights_ to students _._ Ask students if they know
what rights are. Explain that often when people talk about being a citizen,
they talk about rights. Rights are freedoms, or things you can do, say, or
believe that the government or other people can’t, and shouldn’t, take away
from you.

held the biggest birthday party anyone could

remember. That day was the two hundredth



birthday of the United States of America. July 4, 1976, was exactly two

hundred years after leaders of the original thirteen English colonies agreed

to support the Declaration of Independence and start a new nation. Two

hundred years later, people attended concerts and parades, and many

fireworks lit up the night sky all across the United States.

Lesson 9 Becoming a Citizen
**127**


**Show Image 9A-2: Monticello**

But for one group of people, a group of

immigrants, the day was going to be even

more special. In the morning, this group of

people woke up and got dressed in their best

clothes. They left their homes and traveled

to the top of a very special hill not far from

Charlottesville, Virginia. ~~_[Point to central_~~



~~_Virginia on a U.S. map.]_~~ It was at the top of this hill that Thomas Jefferson,

the author of the Declaration of Independence and the third president of the

United States, had built his home two centuries earlier. Jefferson’s home is

called Monticello [mon*tee*chel*oe]. That morning in 1976, the president

of the United States at that time, Gerald Ford, would be there to help each

immigrant become a **citizen** of the United States.


**Show Image 9A-3: Naturalization ceremony**

A citizen is someone who has **rights** given

to them by a country’s government and

responsibilities that go along with those rights.

A person whose parents are U.S. citizens is

automatically a U.S. citizen. But someone





who is born in another country can become

a U.S. citizen after already being a citizen of another country is called a

**naturalized citizen** . ~~_When someone born in another country is naturalized,_~~

~~_that means they are given full citizenship and have all of the rights that other_~~

~~_citizens in that country have._~~ To become a naturalized citizen, a person

might do certain things, such as live within the new country for a certain

period of time, learn to speak the language spoken in that country, and

learn about the laws and history of the new country. Often, naturalized

citizens must take a test in their new language about the laws and history

of their new country. To complete the process, there is a special ceremony

where a group of immigrants gathers together to take an oath, swearing to

be loyal to their new country. Naturalization ceremonies are held all over

the country throughout the year, but the one in Virginia in 1976 was special

because President Gerald Ford was going to speak. Usually, the president

does not speak at naturalization ceremonies, but because 1976 marked the

two hundredth birthday of the United States, this ceremony—and other

ceremonies like it on July 4 and 5—was an exception ~~_or different from what_~~

~~_normally happened_~~ .

**Show Image 9A-4: Jahleel and Layla**

That day, husband and wife Jahleel [ja*leel] and

Layla [lae*l ə ] were ready to become American

citizens. They had come to the United States

from Bangui, the capital of the Central African

Republic. ~~_[Point to Central Africa on a world_~~





~~_map or globe.]_~~ They left because of troubles in

their home country and arrived in the United



States with very little money. Once they arrived, they worked very hard to

start a new life and make a living. Jahleel delivered pizzas all over the town of

Charlottesville. Layla found a job placing products on the shelves of a grocery

store. Jahleel told his wife, “This is America, Layla. If we work hard, we have the

opportunity to have a good life.”


**Show Image 9A-5: Jahleel, Layla, and Nia**

Now, six years after they immigrated, Jahleel

was the manager of the pizza restaurant, and

he and Layla had a newborn daughter, Nia

[nee* ə ]. On the fifth of July, the three of them

drove toward Jefferson’s hill and Monticello for





the naturalization ceremony. ~~_What happens at_~~

~~_a naturalization ceremony?_~~


“There!” Layla said, pointing at a highway sign.

“Turn there!”



Lesson 9 Becoming a Citizen
**129**


**Show Image 9A-6: Pilar and Enrique**

As Jahleel made the turn, another car

followed. In the other car were

Enrique [en*ree*kae] and Pilar [pee*lar]

Gomez and their four children. The Gomez

family had come to the United States from

Northern Mexico, moving first to Texas, then

later to Virginia. ~~_[Ask a volunteer to point to_~~



~~_Northern Mexico on a world map or globe, then to the states of Texas and_~~

~~_Virginia on a U.S. map.]_~~ Pilar worked at a company that published books,

and Enrique taught history at the nearby University of Virginia. The Gomez

family had been in the United States for twelve years now. When they first

immigrated to the United States, they had thought, “We are Mexican, and

will continue to enjoy our Mexican customs even though we live and work

in America.” But now they also wanted to become U.S. citizens. Enrique

remembered the family discussions that had led to this day.


**Show Image 9A-7: Pilar, Enrique, and friends**
**talking over dinner**

One night three years ago, while eating dinner

with some friends, Enrique thought, “How can

I make a life outside of Mexico and not be a

citizen in the new country in which I am living?





~~_Remember, a citizen is someone who has rights_~~

~~_and responsibilities in a country. A U.S. citizen_~~



**130**



~~_can live, work, and vote in the United States._~~ How can I teach American

history and not become a part of it? I want to vote for the leaders of this

country and make my home here.”


Their friend, who was born in the United States, encouraged them, “It’s quite

a process to become a U.S. citizen, but I know you can do it!”


“Yes, it is quite a process,” Pilar said, “First of all, you have to be at least

eighteen years old. Then you have to have lived in the United States for at

least five years. You also have to promise to obey ~~_or follow_~~ the laws. You

have to learn about U.S. history and show that you understand how the U.S.

government works by taking a test.”


Their friend grinned. “Yes, it is helpful to understand how the government

works—though it does sometimes seem very complicated.”


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


They all laughed. Enrique said, “We don’t have to explain every little detail,

we just have to know certain facts about U.S. history, some basic parts of the

U.S. Constitution, and some facts about how the U.S. government works.” ~~_The_~~

~~_Constitution and the Bill of Rights are the most important documents in the_~~

~~_U.S. government._~~


“What about your children?” asked another one of their friends. “If you and

Pilar become citizens, do your children become citizens, too?”


Enrique answered, “Yes, if we become citizens of the United States, our

children will be as well. In fact, that’s one of the main reasons we want to

become naturalized citizens. We want our children to grow up as United States

citizens.” ~~_Were any of your parents naturalized, making you citizens, too?_~~


**Show Image 9A-8: Both families arriving at**
**the ceremony at Monticello**

So now Enrique and Jahleel, along with their

families, gathered in front of Monticello and

joined the crowd on the wide, green lawn

where a stage had been set up and a band was





playing. ~~_A band is a small group of musicians_~~

~~_who play music together. A band can also be a_~~



~~_piece of some material that holds things together, like a rubber band or a hair_~~

~~_band._~~ President Ford and a few other speakers came out, and the President

began to speak to the crowd.


**Show Image 9A-9: President Ford speaking**

He began, “I am very proud to welcome all of

you as fellow citizens of the United States of

America . . . In 1884, France, as a birthday gift,

presented the United States with a statue—the

Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor . . . but you





have given us a birthday present beyond price—

yourselves, your faith, your loyalty, and your

love. We thank you with full and friendly hearts.”

Ford’s speech, stop

place, the rules of a game, a trick of the trade. [These additions] of traditions

and cultures . . . have made America unique among nations and Americans

a new kind of people.” ~~_President Ford is saying that the U.S. Constitution and_~~

~~_its protection from the government was and continues to be a pull factor that_~~

~~_brings many immigrants to the United States._~~


**Show Image 9A-10: New citizens**
**congratulating each other**

President Ford continued, “To be an American

is to [share in] those **principles** ~~_or general_~~

~~_beliefs and rules_~~ which the Declaration

proclaims [or states] and the Constitution





protects . . .” Looking at his audience, Ford

said, “You came as strangers and you leave

here as citizens, equal in . . . rights, equally [protected by] the law, with an

equal share in the promise of the future. ~~_He meant that all citizens have the_~~

~~_same opportunities for a good future._~~ Jefferson wrote about ‘the pursuit

of happiness.’ Our Constitution does not [promise] that any of us will find

[happiness]. But we are free to try.”


When the president finished speaking, everyone cheered. Enrique and Pilar

hugged one another, and then they hugged their children. Next to them in the

crowd, Jahleel and Layla were doing the same. Then Layla turned to hug Pilar

and Enrique turned to hug Jahleel. “Congratulations!” they said to one another.

“Now we are American citizens!” ~~_Do you think President Ford would agree that_~~

1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “A person who becomes a U.S. citizen after
already being a citizen of another country is called a naturalized citizen.”


2. Say the words _naturalized citizen_ with me.


3. A naturalized citizen is a person born in another country who earns the same
rights as native citizens of their new country.


4. After many years of living in the United States, Lizette, who was born in
Argentina, took an oath to be loyal to the United States and became a

5. What does being a naturalized citizen mean? Try to use the words
_naturalized citizen_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students.
If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses: “Being a
naturalized citizen means . . . ”]


6. What are the words we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I am going to read several
sentences. If the sentence describes a person who moved to a new country
and went through a process to receive the same rights as native citizens of
that country, say, “ is a naturalized citizen.” If the sentence describes a
person who is not a naturalized citizen, stay silent.


   - Candice was born in the United States and has lived there her entire life.

   - Mateo was born in Italy. He moved to the United States as an adult,
learned English, and after six years, took an oath to be loyal to the United
States. _(Mateo is a naturalized citizen.)_

here for many years, learned about the history of the United States, took
a test, and took an oath to be loyal to the United States. _(Juliette is a_
_naturalized citizen.)_


   - Charles was born in the United States and when he turned eighteen, he
was old enough to vote. (silent)


   - Paola was born in Mexico. Her family moved to the United States when she
was two years old; they lived here for many years, learned English, took
a test and took an oath to be loyal to the United States. After she turned
eighteen, she was able to vote in her first presidential election. _(Paola is a_
_naturalized citizen.)_


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


  - After you complete this Making Choices activity, reinforce that naturalized
citizens are just as much citizens as people who were born in the United
States. All U.S. citizens, whether naturalized or natural born, share the same

**Notes to Teacher**


Students will hear a lot of information about the U.S. government. Stress
the importance of the Constitution and how it helps the United States run
smoothly. Tell students that when they hear the word _constitution_ in this
lesson, you are referring to the constitution of the United States or the U.S.
Constitution. Explain that many other countries have their own constitutions
with different laws.


By the end of this lesson, students should be familiar with the phrase _We the_
_People_ in the Constitution and understand that it means that the greatest
power behind the American government is the people, the citizens.

Lesson 10 We the People
**143**


**Show Image 10A-2: James Madison**

One of the men who helped write the U.S.

Constitution was James Madison. A small,

quiet man, James Madison was born in 1751 in

Virginia. He did not enjoy crowds, nor did he

enjoy speaking to them. When he did, he had

such a soft voice that listeners had to lean closer

in order to hear Madison’s words. Yet, many



people took the trouble to do so, because they thought Madison’s words were

worth hearing. He was well-known for having great ideas and making the most

confusing problems clear.


**Show Image 10A-3: Continental Congress**

Often at the end of a conversation, this polite,

quiet man would inspire people to think

seriously about his important ideas. That is

what happened when leaders of the new nation

called the United States of America met in





1787 to decide what sort of government they

wanted to form. ~~_This was just ten years after_~~



Support


_Freedom of speech_
means people have
the right to say what
they want. People
can even criticize the
government. In some
countries it is illegal
to say bad or negative
things about the
government, but in the
United States, people
are protected by the
Bill of Rights because
it protects the
freedom of speech.



~~_the colonists declared their independence from England in 1776._~~ The leaders

came from all parts of the country, and had all sorts of ideas. In the end,

however, Madison’s ideas had the greatest influence, or effect, in shaping the

organization of the new American government. For example, Madison’s idea of

having three branches, or sections, of government—a president, a Congress,

and a Supreme Court—is very important today. Together these three branches

in the American government balance each other’s power so that no one

branch can be too powerful and make all of the nation’s decisions. When it was

time to write down what they had agreed upon, Madison did more than anyone

else to write the Constitution of the United States.


**Show Image 10A-4:**
**Madison working on the Bill of Rights**

James Madison’s job was not done after the

Constitution was written. In 1789, Madison

helped write an extra part to add to the

Constitution, called the Bill of Rights. The Bill



~~_or additions. So the Bill of Rights adds onto the Constitution._~~ ~~T~~ he Bill of

Rights protects the rights of Americans, such as freedom of speech. ~~_What is_~~


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity





of Rights consists of the first ten **amendments**

to the Constitution. ~~_Amendments are changes_~~



**144**


~~_the freedom of speech?_~~ The first amendment of the Bill of Rights protects

freedom of religion. ~~_Do you remember how the Separatists were persecuted_~~

~~_in their homeland for having a religion different from the king’s?_~~ The U.S.

Constitution protects the rights of American citizens to practice their own

religion. The first amendment says: “Congress shall make no law respecting an

establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” Over the

years, as the United States changes, Americans have found that the

Constitution needs to change a little bit, too. To do this, Americans add

amendments, which are changes or additions to the Constitution. The

amendments are believed to make the Constitution better for the lives of the

American people.


**Show Image 10A-5: Madison as president**

James Madison’s fine work in developing the

U.S. Constitution earned him the nickname

the “Father of the Constitution.” Later,

James Madison was elected to serve as the

fourth president of the United States. Today,





hundreds of years later, America’s government

and laws are based on what Madison and his



fellow Founding Fathers created. The U.S. Constitution is the highest law of

the land, so no one and no state is allowed to pass a law that goes against the

Constitution’s principles. ~~_What are principles?_~~ ~~(beliefs)~~


**Show Image 10A-6: Close-up of “We the**
**People”**

But what does the Constitution say? Well, right

from the start the authors made a bold ~~_or brave_~~

statement. The Constitution begins with a

very famous introduction, called the Preamble.






~~_[Have students repeat the word_~~ ~~preamble~~ ~~_after_~~

~~_you.] A preamble is an introduction or opening._~~



It starts, “We the People of the United States . . .” This means that the greatest

power behind the American government is the American people—all citizens—

rather than a king or queen, or just the Founding Fathers who wrote the

Constitution. Because of this, the United States is considered a democratic

republic. A republic is a type of government that has a chief of state who is

not a king or queen. ~~_Who is the chief of state of the United States?_~~ Democracy

means to be “governed by the people.” The government of the United States

represents all of the citizens of the United States. The citizens of the United


Lesson 10 We the People
**145**


States can vote to change how our government does things. This is called “the

**consent** of the governed.” In return for this power, the people agree to live by

and follow the laws. ~~_If I ask to borrow your book, and you say, “yes,” then you are_~~

~~_giving me consent, or approval, to borrow your book. Who gives consent and is_~~

~~_the greatest power behind the American government?_~~


**Show Image 10A-7: White House, Capitol**
**building, Supreme Court, fighter jet**

The Preamble goes on to say that citizens want

the Constitution to make the nation run fairly

for everyone, and the states will unite, or work

together, to help make the nation work smoothly.





The Preamble, or introduction to the Constitution,

also tells us that American laws, or rules, must

protect the liberties, or freedoms, of all citizens,

not just some. It is an agreement that the Constitution is our most important set

of rules. The Preamble says that the federal government will include an army,

navy, and other military forces to protect Americans from enemies. It also says

that the government and the laws are meant to protect the liberties, or freedoms,

for Americans now and in the future. ~~_What are some things the Preamble tells us?_~~

~~_How does the Constitution affect you?_~~


The rest of the Constitution goes on to describe the different things the

government is supposed to do. The government makes laws and carries

them out. It solves problems. And the government protects Americans

from certain dangers. It tells us how we are supposed to make those things

happen. ~~_[As you read the next sentence, point to the following images for_~~

~~_the following references: the image of the White House for the office of the_~~

~~_president, the image of the Capitol building for the Congress, and the image_~~

~~_of the Supreme Court building for the Supreme Court.]_~~ The Constitution

also created the office of the President of the United States, the Congress,

and the Supreme Court, which are made up of people who try to follow the

principles of the Constitution. ~~_What does the Constitution go on to say after_~~

~~_the Preamble?_~~ One reason the writers of the Constitution are still so admired

is that they did an amazing job of creating a form of government that would

not only help solve the problems of their own time, but would also help solve

all sorts of problems they thought might come along later. ~~_Why do you think_~~


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


~~_it would be difficult to plan for problems that do not yet exist?_~~


**Show Image 10A-8: Madison and other**
**Founding Fathers**

Today, “We the People of the United States”

have a Congress made up of people from

every state. We have a president to carry

out those laws and courts to help us settle





**disagreements** ~~_or arguments_~~ and keep the

peace. Our country has military forces to



protect us. Also, there are other parts of the government, all of which are

based on the ideas that James Madison and other Founding Fathers wrote

down over two hundred years ago in the U.S. Constitution.


As time goes on and our country grows, bringing new problems and

wonderful new opportunities, new laws are being added to deal with

problems and to protect the people. Whenever a new law is added, it is our

job—our responsibility—to follow the new law or to speak out if we feel that

the law does not agree with the principles in the Constitution.


Although the Constitution was written over two hundred years ago, it still

tells us how our government is supposed to work, even today.

- Reinforce to students that the word _constitution_ can describe any laws and/
or principles that explain the basic plan and general rules of a group, whether
a country or another organization.


- Tell students that their classroom is a kind of group or organization. If you
have classroom rules, tell students that the rules of your classroom are like
laws, and all of these rules together are your classroom constitution.


- Share with students that as a class you will share these rules and that you,
the teacher, will write them down as a “Classroom Constitution,” just like
James Madison wrote everything down when the Founding Fathers created
the U.S. Constitution.


- Using a large piece of chart paper, have your students recite the classroom
rules as you write them down. Then label the document “Classroom
Constitution.”


- Once the rules are written down, reread them to the class. Tell students you
will now vote on these rules. To help students vote, you may wish to ask if
they think they will be able to follow the rules, if they think the rules are fair,
or if they think the rules will benefit everyone in the class.


- Students may wish to change some of the rules. If they do, ask students to
vote on whether they all like or dislike the proposed changes. Tell students
that if the majority of them like the proposed changes, these changes will
become amendments to their Classroom Constitution.


- Take this moment to reinforce the term _amendment_ . Share with students
that, in our Constitution, amendments are very rare—only twenty-seven have
been added since the Constitution was first approved more than two hundred
years ago.


- After the class has voted on all of the rules and amendments, explain to
students that as citizens of the classroom they have the power to change
how the classroom is run. Tell students that they just made these changes by
voting and that this is called “the consent of the governed.” Ask if everyone is
in favor of these rules as a Classroom Constitution. If students are in favor of

#### Read-Aloud



**Speaking and Listening:** Students will review citizenship and the importance of
the U.S. Constitution.





~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED? (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that in the previous Read-Alouds, they learned about how
immigrants become citizens and some of the important documents that
explain how they should act as citizens. Ask students to recall the process of
becoming a citizen by asking the following questions:


    - What is a citizen? _(a legally recognized subject or national of a country,_
_state, or commonwealth, either native or naturalized. Citizens have specific_
_rights based on where they live based on documents like the Constitution_
_and Bill of Rights in the United States.)_


    - What is a naturalized citizen? _(a person who moves to a particular country_
_and wants to be a part of it, even though they were not born there; They,_
_too, must learn about and follow the rules of a particular country. They have_
_to live in their new country for a few years, learn the country’s language,_
_take a test, and participate in a ceremony in order to become a naturalized_
_citizen.)_


  - Then remind students what they learned about James Madison and his
important ideas for the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights by asking the
following questions:


    - What does the word _rights_ mean? _(freedoms belonging to a person that the_
_government cannot, and should not, take away)_


    - What is the Bill of Rights? _(The Bill of Rights is a list of amendments, or_
_changes, to the Constitution.)_


    - What specific rights are protected in the Bill of Rights? _(The Bill of Rights_
_includes freedom of speech and freedom of religion.)_

If you provided students
with examples of rights
and responsibilities in
Lesson 9, you may wish
to recall those or have
students recall them.

 - Tell students that these amendments are meant to protect us from the
government if it ever tries to take away our rights or decide who gets them
and who doesn’t.


Check for Understanding


**Turn and Talk:** Turn to a partner and talk about one of the rights
in the Bill of Rights and how you are able to use or practice that
in your daily life. (For example, a student may state that they
are able to say what is on their mind because of the freedom
of speech, or go to a house of worship because of freedom of
religion.)


~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION OR TERMS (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that through the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the
amendments, American citizens are promised certain rights.


 - Ask students to recall what rights are. _(freedoms belonging to a person that_
_the government cannot, and should not, take away)_ Share with students
that no one owns these rights and that one does not have to do anything to
deserve [or get] them.


 - Tell students that in addition to these rights, American citizens are expected
to have certain responsibilities.


 - Ask students to recall what responsibilities are. _(things people depend_
_on you to do)_ Tell students they will learn more about these rights and
responsibilities in today’s Read-Aloud.

**Show Image 11A-1: Native Americans,**
**European explorer, Pilgrims**

For a long time now, you have been learning

about the history of the United States. You

heard about Native Americans who were living

here before Europeans arrived. You learned





about those Europeans who explored North

and South America, and you also learned



about the Pilgrims who left Europe on the _Mayflower_ because they wanted to

practice their religion freely.


**Show Image 11A-2: Washington, Jefferson,**
**and Madison**

Then you learned how, much later, George

Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James

Madison, and other leaders started a new

nation called the United States of America,





and about how difficult it was to create a

new type of government for this new nation

Lesson 11 Immigration and Citizenship
**157**


~~_or country_~~ . You learned about Thomas Jefferson’s great Declaration of

Independence and James Madison’s brilliant Constitution and Bill of Rights.

These Founding Fathers believed they were doing the right thing for this new

nation, and their hard work continues to serve our country today.


**Show Image 11A-3: Modern immigrants**

You have also learned about immigrants,

people who leave their home country to settle

in a different country. Even today, immigrants

are still coming to the United States. Why are

immigrants still coming to the United States?





Well, if you remember, people have immigrated

to the United States because of certain push



and pull factors. Dangers in their home countries, not enough jobs, and not

being able to practice their religion or speak freely are some factors that

have pushed people to leave their homelands. On the other hand, jobs, land,

and freedoms given to American citizens in the Bill of Rights are some of

the factors that have pulled people to America, the “land of opportunity.”

These are some reasons why immigrants want to come to the United States

and become U.S. citizens. ~~_What do we call people born as citizens of another_~~

~~_country who become U.S. citizens?_~~ ~~(naturalized citizens)~~ Citizens have

specific rights that are based on where they live, and documents such as the

Constitution and Bill of Rights in the United States. Let’s find out more about

what it means to be a citizen.


**Show Image 11A-4: James Madison**

James Madison did so much to create the

Constitution that he is considered the “Father

of the Constitution.” Later, Madison and

other leaders added some more laws to the

Constitution. Doing this is called amending





the Constitution, so the parts they added

were called amendments. Madison and the



**158**



other Founding Fathers wrote a list of amendments to the U.S. Constitution

called the Bill of Rights, and later on, other leaders added more amendments

protecting more rights for U.S. citizens. ~~_The first ten amendments to the_~~

~~_Constitution are called the Bill of Rights. What is an amendment?_~~ ~~(a change~~

~~or addition)~~


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


**Show Image 11A-5: Bill of Rights**

The Bill of Rights is a list of rights **guaranteed**

~~_or promised_~~ to citizens of the United States.

Rights are freedoms that the government

cannot, and should not, take away from

its citizens.


A bill of rights was a new idea in the world

when it was created. In most countries many



years ago (and in some countries even today), kings, queens, or generals

ran the government any way they liked. Everyone living in that country was

expected to do what the ruler said to do or they might be arrested and put

into jail or be forced to leave the country. ~~_Can you recall the name of a person_~~

~~_who was going to be put into jail for writing about his government?_~~ ~~(Charles~~

~~Steinmetz)~~ Someone who was arrested might not get the chance to tell their

side of the story to a judge in order to get out of jail; or if they did, the judge

might work for the king and not really listen or care to be fair. ~~_How would_~~

~~_you feel if you got in trouble for something without getting to tell your side of_~~

~~_the story?_~~


**Show Image 11A-6: Courtroom with judge**
**and jury**

In the United States, however, laws are

supposed to protect citizens from such

problems. For example, no one is supposed

to arrest another person just because he





doesn’t like that person or that person’s

ideas. If someone is arrested for a crime or



doing something that is against the laws of the country, the government

cannot just keep them in jail for as long as they want. That person has the

right to tell their side of the story to a judge and/or to a **jury**, a group of

people who listen to all the facts and both sides of an argument before

deciding if a person is guilty or not guilty. Anyone that comes before a judge

and/or jury is considered innocent until proven guilty. ~~_A judge helps a jury_~~

~~_come to a fair decision. Perhaps you know someone who has served on a_~~

~~_jury in a court. [Point to the members of the jury shown in the image.]_~~

**Show Image 11A-7: Americans voting**

Another very important right and duty of

citizens is the right to vote. ~~_When you turn_~~

~~_eighteen years old, you can fill out a form so_~~

~~_you can vote. The people in this picture are_~~

~~_exercising their right to vote. There are often_~~

~~_voting booths to allow for privacy._~~ Adult U.S.

citizens decide who will be their president,

who will represent them in the Senate or the House of Representatives, or

who will be their local mayor. ~~_These are all jobs that are part of running our_~~

~~_government._~~ U.S. citizens vote for the people they want to do these jobs, and

whoever receives the most votes gets to serve in that job. Any adult citizen

can run for most elected positions or jobs. The Constitution says that people

who were not born in the United States cannot run for the presidency. ~~_Can a_~~

~~_naturalized citizen ever run for president?_~~


If you are a U.S. citizen, when you grow up you may decide to run for

government office. That means you let other people know you want a job in

the government, and you hope citizens will vote to have you represent them

in the government. As an adult citizen, even if you do not run for office, you

will get to vote for your representatives in government offices. Voting is one

of your rights and duties as a U.S. citizen. ~~_Raise your hand if you have ever_~~

~~_gone with a family member or adult friend when they went to vote._~~


**Show Image 11A-8: Freedom of Speech**

~~_In this image, someone is holding a sign that_~~

~~_says “Free Speech”. This could be at a protest_~~

~~_or march, and it shows that there is something_~~

~~_someone wants to be changed. This is an_~~

~~_example of exercising, or using, the right_~~

~~_to freedom of speech._~~ Freedom of speech,

freedom of religion, the right to vote, and the

right to a fast and fair trial are just a few of the rights listed in the Bill of Rights.

But citizens also have responsibilities. ~~_Responsibilities are duties you are in_~~

~~_charge of, or things someone else trusts you to do._~~ For example, even though

you have freedom of speech, you still have a responsibility to not say things

that might put people in danger or say things that might hurt others. Notice

how rights and responsibilities go together.


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


**Show Image 11A-9: Person filling in tax form**

We have the responsibility to follow the laws

of our country. We also have the responsibility

to pay taxes—the money we are required by

law to give to our government that pays for

things all citizens enjoy. ~~_The person in the_~~

~~_picture is filling out a tax form to figure out how_~~

~~_much is owed to the government._~~ Our taxes



pay for things like public schools where you can learn; public parks where

you can play; public libraries where you can check out your favorite books;

and the roads and sidewalks that help you get to those places. ~~_Can you name_~~

~~_something that you enjoy that has been created using money from taxes?_~~


**Show Image 11A-10: People in a foreign**
**country protesting for freedom**

When the United States began, few countries

offered so many rights to their citizens. After

the people of the United States decided to

make these rights a part of their country’s





laws, citizens of many other countries

decided that they wanted the same rights and



freedoms. Citizens around the world insisted on new laws to protect their

rights, and many countries changed their laws. However, this did not happen

everywhere. Even today, people in many nations do not enjoy the same rights

that citizens enjoy here in the United States. In such places, some people

think, “I want to leave my country and go to the United States. There I will

be free to decide what I want to do or say. I will not have to be afraid that

government leaders will punish me just for disagreeing with them.” ~~_Is this a_~~

~~_push or pull factor?_~~


Sometimes people who disagree with the laws in their country feel unsafe

because their government may threaten them if they speak out. If there is

a war, people may have to leave and move to other countries because they

are no longer safe. The United States government and other governments

around the world often let such people, called **refugees**, come to their

countries for safety. ~~_Can you hear the word_~~ ~~refuge~~ ~~_in the word_~~ ~~refugee~~ ~~_?_~~

~~_Refugees leave the dangers of their homelands for the refuge, or safety, of_~~

~~_another country._~~ The United States allows only a certain number of refugees

each year, so in less serious cases, refugees often have to wait their turn

to come to the United States. One reason for this is to make sure there are

enough jobs for the newcomers, so that they can earn the money they need

to support themselves and provide themselves with necessities such as food,

clothes, and a place to stay.


**Show Image 11A-11: Open campaign stage**

James Madison and his fellow leaders, whose

ancestors were immigrants to America,

wrote laws, or rules, that all United States

citizens must follow. Today’s citizens can vote

to change those laws or to make new laws.





Still, all United States laws must go along

with the principles in the Constitution and its



**162**



amendments like the Bill of Rights. These were intended to guarantee the

rights of all citizens—whether naturalized or born in the United States—both

now and in the future.


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


Check for Understanding


**Brainstorm:** [Divide the class in half. To one half, ask the following
question.] What are some rights, or freedoms, all U.S. citizens
enjoy? ( _right to vote_, _right to fair trial, right to free speech, right_
_to religious freedom, etc.)_ [You may wish to record these on the
board/chart paper. To the other half of the class, ask the following
question.] What are some responsibilities, or duties, of all U.S.
citizens? _(to obey the law; to not do things that would hurt others; to_
_pay taxes)_ [You may wish to record these on the board/chart paper.
Ask students to compare these rights and responsibilities.] Do the
rights make the responsibilities worthwhile? _(Answers will vary, but_

 - Ask the students riddles such as the following to review core content:


   - I am considered the “Father of the Constitution” since I helped write most
of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Who am I? _(James Madison)_


   - I am a document made up of the first ten amendments to the Constitution.
What am I? _(the Bill of Rights)_


   - I am a document that explains how the U.S. government works and lays
down the foundation for the laws of the United States. What am I? _(the_
_Constitution)_


   - I am the introduction to the Constitution and begin with the words “We the
People.” What am I? _(the Preamble)_

**Class Book: Immigration and Citizenship**


Materials: Drawing paper, drawing tools

  - Tell the class or a group of students that they are going to finish their
class book to help them remember what they have learned in this unit
about immigration, citizenship, the U.S. government, and the freedoms
that bring immigrants to the United States. Have the students brainstorm
important information about these topics. Students may also include any
information they have learned about being an American citizen, rights and
responsibilities, and the U.S. government. Have each student choose one
idea to draw a picture of and ask them to write a caption for the picture. Bind

#### Unit Assessment


This unit assessment evaluates each student’s retention of unit- specific
and academic vocabulary words and the core content targeted in _Land of_
_Opportunity._ The results should guide review and remediation the following day.


There are three parts to this assessment. You may choose to do the
parts in more than one sitting if you feel this is more appropriate for your
students. Part I (vocabulary assessment) is divided into two sections: the
first assesses unit-related vocabulary, and the second assesses academic
vocabulary. Parts II and III of the assessment address the core content
targeted in _Land of Opportunity._

~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


Please use this final day to address class results of the Unit Assessment. Based on
the results of the Formative and Unit Assessments, you may wish to use this class
time to provide remediation opportunities that target specific areas of weakness for
individual students, small groups, or the whole class.


Alternatively, you may choose to use this class time to extend or enrich students’
experience with unit knowledge. A number of enrichment activities are provided
below in order to provide students with opportunities to enliven their experiences
with unit concepts.


~~**REMEDIATION**~~


You may choose to regroup students according to particular areas of
weakness, as indicated by Formative and Unit Assessment results.


Remediation opportunities include:


  - targeting Review Activities


  - revisiting lesson Applications


  - rereading and discussing select Read-Alouds


  - using corresponding activities in the Language Studio


~~**ENRICHMENT**~~


**Guest Speaker**

  - Invite parents or trusted community members who are naturalized citizens
to talk about being an immigrant and/or the process of becoming a citizen.
Invite them to bring in any photographs or other objects that were part of
this history. You will want to share with your guest speakers, ahead of time,
what you have already discussed in class so that they are better able to
address the students.


Unit 9 Land of Opportunity


**Personal Connections**

 - Your students should have taken home a family letter (Activity Page 1.2),
which introduced the unit to a family member. This letter also asked a family
member or adult friend to share with students their immigration story or
their family’s immigration history. Have students retell the immigration
history told to them by the adults in their lives. Encourage students to bring
in any photographs or items they might have to help them share this history.
If students are unprepared for this exercise, you may wish to share your own
family’s immigration history as an example.


**“The Star-Spangled Banner”**


Materials: A recording of “The Star-Spangled Banner”; drawing paper,
drawing tools

 - Have students listen to “The Star-Spangled Banner” again. While they listen,
have them draw what information comes to mind from the unit. You may
wish to work with your school’s music teacher to have your students learn
this song.


**“We the People” Crossword**


Materials: Activity Page CA.1

 - Using Activity Page CA.1, read and discuss the Preamble with your students.


_“We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect_
_Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for_
_the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the_
_Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and_
_establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”_


 - As you discuss the Preamble, you may wish to prompt responses with the
following questions:


   - What do we call the introduction to the Constitution? _(the Preamble)_


   - What does the Preamble say the people want the Constitution to do? _(have_
_the states form a more perfect union so the nation runs more fairly)_


   - What does the Preamble say that American laws must do? _(establish_
_justice or protect the liberties and freedoms of all the people)_


 - Tell students that each numbered item on the Activity Page is a clue to a
word in the box. Explain that students will need to first read the clue, then
find the matching word, and finally write the matching word in the puzzle.
Depending on your class, you may wish to complete one example together
as a group and/or read all of the clues out loud, having students silently write
the matching word in the puzzle.

Encourage students
to use a dictionary to
help them discover
definitions, synonyms,
and antonyms for
these words.

 - Additionally, _Schoolhouse Rock!_ has a song and a video of the Preamble
that your students may enjoy. After you watch the video or listen to the song
about the Preamble, you may wish to lead students in a discussion about
the Preamble, the Constitution, and its significance to the American people.
Make sure to reinforce unit vocabulary and concepts throughout
the discussion.


**Exploring Melting Pots**


Materials: Art materials

 - Have students create a melting pot of their own. Ask students to create a
symbol that represents themselves and place it in a cut-out pot to make a
classroom stew.


**Letter to James Madison**

 - Have students use what they learned about the five parts of a letter to write
a letter to James Madison. You may wish to guide students through the five
parts of the friendly letter again before they begin brainstorming. Students
may write about what they think of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights or
ask any questions they have about these two documents.


**Role-Play a Scene**

 - Have students work in pairs to role-play this scene: It’s the year 1900. You
and your partner are sailing into New York Harbor together, coming to your
new home—America! How would you feel at that moment? What would you
say? Make up dialogue for the scene and act it out.


**Research Activity: Famous Immigrants**

 - Remind students they have learned a lot about the history of immigration to
the United States. Remind students they have learned that the United States
is referred to as a land of immigrants.


 - If students are interested, have them research famous immigrants that have
made improvements to the United States, like Charles Steinmetz. Their
research does not have to focus on the field of science; they may look into
the arts, music, literature, etc.


 - Have students present their findings to a group of students or to the class.


**Writing Prompts**

 - Students may be given an additional writing prompt such as the following:


   - The day I became a naturalized citizen . . .

In order for the ELL to meet grade-level learning expectations<br>across foundation and enrichment curriculum, all instruction delivered in English must be linguistically accommodated<br>(communicated, sequenced, and scaffolded) commensurate with the student’s level of English language proficiency. For<br>kindergarten and grade 1, certain of these student expectations do not apply until the student has reached the stage of generating<br>original written text using a standard writing system. The student is expected to:|
|ELPS 5.A|learn relationships between sounds and letters of the<br>English language to represent sounds when writing in<br>English||
|ELPS 5.B|write using newly acquired basic vocabulary and<br>content-based grade-level vocabulary||
|ELPS 5.C|spell familiar English words with increasing accuracy,<br>and employ English spelling patterns and rules with<br>increasing accuracy as more English is acquired||
|ELPS 5.D|edit writing for standard grammar and usage, including<br>subject-verb agreement, pronoun agreement, and<br>appropriate verb tenses commensurate with grade-<br>level expectations as more English is acquired||
|ELPS 5.E|employ increasingly complex grammatical structures<br>in content area writing commensurate with grade level<br>expectations such as (i) using correct verbs, tenses,<br>and pronouns/antecedents; (ii) using possessive case<br>(apostrophe -s) correctly; and, (iii) using negatives and<br>contractions correctly|p. 58|
|ELPS 5.F|write using a variety of grade-appropriate sentence<br>lengths, patterns, and connecting words to combine<br>phrases, clauses, and sentences in increasingly<br>accurate ways as more English is acquired|p. 19|
|ELPS 5.G|narrate, describe, and explain with increasing<br>specificity and detail to fulfill content area writing<br>needs as more English is acquired|p. 33, p. 46, p. 74, p. 120, p. 136, p. 151|
