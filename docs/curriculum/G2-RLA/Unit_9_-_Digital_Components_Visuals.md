**Lesson 11: “The Star-Spangled Banner”**

#### **The Star-Spangled Banner** _Oh, say, can you see by the dawn’s early light,_ _What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming?_ _Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight,_ _O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?_ _And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air_ _Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there._ _Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave_ _O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?_
