#### Introduction


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching the _Fairy_
_Tales and Tall Tales_ unit. The Teacher Guide for _Fairy Tales and Tall Tales_ contains eight daily lessons,
each of which is composed of two distinct parts, so the lesson may be divided into smaller chunks
of time and presented at different intervals during the day. Each entire lesson will require a total of
sixty minutes.


This unit includes a Pausing Point following Lesson 4, at the end of the fairy tales section. At the
end of the unit, a Unit Review, a Unit Assessment, and Culminating Activities are included to allow
time to review, reinforce, assess, and remediate content knowledge. You should spend no more than
twelve days total on this unit.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


At the back of this Teacher Guide you will find a section titled “Teacher Resources.” In this section
you will find the following:


  - Activity Book Answer Key


  - Measures of Text Complexity


  - Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Correlation Chart


  - English Language Proficiency Standards Correlation Chart


~~**INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS**~~


Along with this Teacher Guide, you will need:


  - Flip Book for _Fairy Tales and Tall Tales_


  - Activity Book for _Fairy Tales and Tall Tales_


  - Digital Components for _Fairy Tales and Tall Tales_


Additional resources that you may wish to integrate into your classroom instruction are:


  - User Guide: You may wish to consult the program’s User Guide throughout this unit and others for
best practices and strategies on Supporting All Learners, including Emergent Bilingual Students,
Gifted/Talented Students, Dual Language Students, and Students with Disabilities.


All instructional materials can also be found in the program’s online materials.


Introduction
**1**


~~**WHY FAIRY TALES AND TALL TALES ARE IMPORTANT**~~


This unit will introduce students to classic fairy tales and tall tales and the well-known lessons they
teach. This unit will also lay the foundation for understanding stories in future grades. The first half
of the _Fairy Tales and Tall Tales_ unit focuses on fairy tales. These fairy tales will remind students of
the elements of fiction they have heard about in previous grades and will be a good reintroduction
to the practice of listening and learning. Students who have used the program in Kindergarten and
Grade 1 will be familiar with some fairy tales and the elements of the fairy tale genre from the _Kings_
_and Queens_ unit (Kindergarten) and from the _Fairy Tales_ unit (Grade 1). In this unit, students will be
reminded of these elements and hear the fairy tales “The Fisherman and His Wife,” “The Emperor’s
New Clothes,” and “Beauty and the Beast.” Students will be able to relate to the problems faced by
characters in each of these memorable tales, as well as learn from the lessons in each story.


The second half of the unit focuses on tall tales and the elements of that genre. Students will be
introduced to the tall tales “Paul Bunyan,” “Pecos Bill,” “John Henry,” and “Casey Jones.” Learning
about tall tales will introduce students to the setting of the American frontier and some of the
occupations settlers had there. For students who used the program in Grade 1, it will reinforce what
they have already learned about the American frontier in the _Heading West: Exploring the Frontier_
unit (Grade 1) because many of the tall tale characters head west on their adventures. The tall tales
in this unit will also introduce students to the literary concept of exaggeration.


The texts that students will be reading and discussing in this unit provide opportunities for students to
build content knowledge and draw connections to social studies. You may build on class discussions to
support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strand of Geography from the Social
Studies TEKS. This content is not a replacement for grade level social studies content. For information
about the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the
Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.

~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED**~~


The following units, and the specific core content that was targeted in those units, are particularly
relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _Fairy Tales and Tall Tales_ . This background
knowledge will greatly enhance students’ understanding of the Read-Alouds they are about to enjoy.


Nursery Rhymes and Fables (Kindergarten)


Fairy Tales and Folktales (Kindergarten)


Kings and Queens (Kindergarten)


Sharing Stories (Grade 1)


Fairy Tales (Grade 1)


Heading West: Exploring the Frontier (Grade 1)

~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR FAIRY TALES AND TALL TALES**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _Fairy Tales and Tall Tales_ in the forms
in which they appear in the Read-Alouds or, in some instances, in the Introducing the Read-Aloud
section at the beginning of the lesson. Boldfaced words in the list have an associated Word Work
activity. The inclusion of the words on this list does not mean that students are immediately
expected to be able to use all of these words on their own. However, through repeated exposure
throughout the lessons, they should acquire a good understanding of most of these words and begin
to use some of them in conversation.

~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit, students will explore the genre of narrative writing. They will learn about characteristics
of fairy tales and tall tales, including the types of characters, settings, and plots often associated
with these stories. Students will work independently to rewrite a fairy tale by changing one element
of “The Fisherman and His Wife” and write a description of a scene from “Beauty and the Beast.”
Students will also work as a class to gather information about tall tales in a Tall Tales Characteristics
Chart. Students will create a Venn diagram comparing and contrasting John Henry and Casey Jones.


The following activities may be added to students’ writing portfolios to showcase student writing
within and across units:


  - Rewriting the Read-Aloud (Lesson 1)


  - Write About It (Lesson 3)


  - Tall Tales Characteristics Chart (Lesson 8)


  - Venn Diagram (Lesson 8)


~~**FOUNDATIONAL ORAL LANGUAGE**~~


Throughout the unit and grade, students will have many opportunities to show they can follow,
restate, and give oral directions. You may choose to model these skills for students to practice
during activities.


 - Explain to students that following instructions is important because it’s something we do every
day in different places. At home, students follow their family’s instructions to do chores. At
school, they follow your instructions to learn and work together. At recess or in the park, they
follow instructions to learn new games. Explain that to follow instructions, students need to learn
to pay attention and listen carefully.


 - Likewise, when they give instructions, if they want someone to be successful in completing the
task, their instructions should be given in a logical order, have details, and be concise, meaning
giving a lot of information in a few words.


Introduction
**5**


     - Provide opportunities for students to practice these skills. For example, you may ask students
for their attention, and make sure the classroom is quiet. Give students one- and two-step
instructions to follow, such as “Get a sheet of paper from the front of the room.” Clearly state
your instruction. Ask students if the direction is clear, then have them restate it for you. Continue
with examples of more complicated directions.


     - Then have students work with partners or small groups to take turns giving, restating, and
following directions. ~~**[ TEKS 2.1.B ]**~~


**TEKS 2.1.B** Follow, restate, and give oral instructions that involve a short, related sequence of actions.

fisherman went down to the sea to fish.





**14**



One day, as the fisherman sat looking into the

clear, shining water, he felt a strong tug on his

line. He pulled and pulled with all his **might**, ~~_or strength,_~~ until, at last, out

flopped a large golden fish. Then, all of a sudden, the fish spoke.

“Please let me go,” said the fish. “I am not an ordinary fish. I am an

**enchanted** prince. Put me back in the water and let me live!” ~~_The fish says_~~

~~_he is actually a prince under a magic spell. Do you think the fish is really an_~~

~~_enchanted prince?_~~


“Swim away!” said the fisherman. “I would not eat a fish that can talk!”


At the end of the day, the fisherman went back to his wife in the little, old,

run-down hut.


**Show Image 1A-3 The fisherman arriving**
**home**


“Didn’t you catch anything today?” she asked.


“No,” said the fisherman. “I did catch one fish,





but he told me he was an enchanted prince

and asked me to throw him back, so I did.”



“You fool!” said the wife. “That was a magic fish! You should have asked him

for something.”


“Like what?” said the fisherman.


“Go back and ask him to change this dinky hut into a **charming** cottage.”

~~Charming~~ ~~_means very pleasing. Why does the wife wish for a charming cottage?_~~


The fisherman did not want to go, but he did not want to argue with his wife,

either. So he made his way back to the sea.


When he arrived, the water was no longer clear and shining. It was dull and

greenish.


**Show Image 1A-4: The fisherman and the**
**cottage**

The fisherman called:


“Hear me, please, oh magic fish.





My wife has sent me with a wish.”


The fish swam up to the surface and asked,



“What does she want?”


Lesson 1 The Fisherman and His Wife
**15**


“She says she wants to live in a charming cottage,” said the fisherman.


“Go home,” said the fish. “She has her cottage.” ~~_What do you predict will_~~

~~_happen next?_~~


The fisherman went home. Sure enough, there was his wife, standing in the

doorway of a charming cottage. The cottage had a little front yard, with a

garden and some chickens and a goose pecking at the ground. Inside there

was a living room, a kitchen, a dining room, and a bedroom. ~~_[Point to the_~~

~~_charming cottage, and then show Image 1A-2 and point to the hut.] In what_~~

~~_ways is the cottage better?_~~


“Wonderful!” said the fisherman. “This is sure to make you very happy!”


The fisherman’s wife was happy—for about a week. ~~_What do you predict the_~~

~~_conflict will be in this part of the story?_~~


**Show Image 1A-5: The fisherman’s wife**

Then she said, “Husband, I am tired of this

tiny little cottage. I want to live in a big stone

castle. Go and ask the fish to give us a castle.”


“But, wife,” said the fisherman, “he has just





given us this cottage. If I go back again so

soon, he may be angry with me.”



“Go and ask!” said the wife.


The fisherman shook his head and mumbled to himself, “It’s not right.” But he

did as he was told. ~~_Why does the fisherman think his wife’s new wish is not right?_~~


**Show Image 1A-6: The fisherman on the dock**

When he reached the sea, the water had

turned from dull green to dark purple and gray.

~~_[Point to the sea.]_~~ The fisherman called:


“Hear me, please, oh magic fish.





My wife has sent me with a wish.”



**16**



When the fish swam up, the fisherman said, “My wife wishes to live in a big

“Go home,” said the fish. “You will find her in a castle.” ~~_Was your prediction about_~~

~~_the conflict correct? How do you think this conflict will affect the rest of the story?_~~


Unit 1 Fairy Tales and Tall Tales


**Show Image 1A-7: The fisherman’s stone castle**

When the fisherman got back, he could hardly

believe his eyes. The charming cottage had

been replaced by a large stone castle. A

servant unrolled a drawbridge for him. The

fisherman went across the bridge and into the

castle, where he found two servants sweeping

a smooth marble floor. The walls were covered



with beautiful tapestries. Crystal chandeliers hung from the ceilings. His wife

stood in the center of the room, next to a table piled high with delicious foods.


“Now, indeed, you will be content,” said the fisherman to his wife. ~~_Do you_~~

~~_think the fisherman’s wife will be content, or happy?_~~


And she was—until the next morning.


As the sun rose, the fisherman’s wife poked her husband in the side and said,

“Husband, get up. Go to the fish at once and tell him that I wish to be queen

of all the land.”


“Heavens!” cried the fisherman. “I can’t ask for that!” ~~_Does the fisherman_~~

~~_want to ask the fish for another wish?_~~


“Go and ask him!” said his wife. ~~_Were your predictions about what would_~~

~~_happen next in the fairy tale correct? If not, why not?_~~


**Show Image 1A-8: The fisherman and the fish**

The dejected fisherman walked to the sea.

~~Dejected~~ ~~_means sad. Why do you think the_~~

~~_fisherman is sad?_~~ The water was black. It

bubbled and gave off a foul smell. ~~_[Point to the_~~

~~_sea.] If the sea was foul-smelling, did it smell_~~





~~_good?_~~



The fisherman **hesitated**, ~~_or waited,_~~ and then called:


“Hear me, please, oh magic fish.


My wife has sent me with a wish.”


The fish swam up and asked, “Now what does she want?”


With his head hung low, the fisherman said, “My wife wishes to be queen of

all the land.” ~~_What problems or conflict do you predict happening in the next_~~

~~_part of the story?_~~


Lesson 1 The Fisherman and His Wife
**17**


“Go home,” said the fish. “She is already queen.”


The fisherman went home and found that the castle had grown even larger. It

had tall stone turrets on each corner and a crimson flag flapping in the wind.

Two sentries in suits of armor stood at the door. ~~_Do you think the wife will be_~~

~~_satisfied now that she is a queen?_~~


**Show Image 1A-9: The fisherman’s wife on a**

They escorted the fisherman inside, where he

found his wife sitting on a high throne studded

with diamonds. She wore a long silk dress and

a golden crown. In her hand she held a scepter





studded with rubies. On one side of her stood

barons, dukes, and duchesses. On the other

side stood a line of ladies-in-waiting, each one shorter than the one before.


“So,” said the fisherman, “now you are queen.”


“Indeed,” said his wife haughtily. ~~Haughtily~~ ~~_means rudely and proudly._~~


“Well, then,” said the fisherman. “I suppose there is nothing more to wish for.”

~~_Do you think the wife will agree that there is nothing more to wish for?_~~


But that very evening, as the sun went down and the moon began to rise in

the sky, the fisherman’s wife sent for her husband. ~~_What do you think the wife_~~

~~_will ask for? Would you grant her another wish if you were the fish?_~~

“Hear me, please, oh magic fish.


My wife has sent me with a wish.”


The fish swam up and asked, “What does she want?”


The fisherman replied, “My wife wants the power to make the sun and the

moon rise and set whenever she chooses.” ~~_Based on the events so far, how do_~~

~~_the actions of the characters surprise you? How do you think the story will end?_~~

The fish only said, “Go home.” And so he did.

~~_Do you think the fish has granted the woman’s_~~

old, run-down hut. And there they live to this

very day.





~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


If students have difficulty responding to questions, reread pertinent lines of
the Read-Aloud and/or refer to specific images. If students give one-word
answers and/or fail to use Read-Aloud or unit vocabulary in their responses,
acknowledge correct responses by expanding students’ responses using
richer and more complex language. Ask students to answer in complete
sentences by having them restate the question in their responses.


1. **Evaluative.** Based on what you know about fairy tales, were your predictions
about the events correct? _(Answers may vary.)_ ~~**[TEKS 2.6.C ]**~~


2. **Literal.** The fisherman caught a fish, but then let him go. Who did the fish
say he was? _(an enchanted prince, or a prince under a magical spell)_


3. **Literal.** What things does the wife tell the fisherman to ask the fish for? _(a_
_charming cottage, a stone castle, to be queen, to make the sun rise and set on_

and over again? _(embarrassed, uncomfortable, bad)_


5. **Literal.** How did the sea change each time the fisherman asked the fish
for another wish? _(It became darker and more stirred up.)_ [You may wish to
review images from the Read-Aloud that illustrate how the sea changed.]


6. **Evaluative.** How do you think the fish’s feelings changed each time he
granted a wish? _(It appeared that he became angrier, or more impatient, each_
_time.)_ [Explain that it seems as if the sea became more violent as the fish
became angrier.]


7. **Literal.** What happened when the wife asked to command the sun to rise
and set? _(The fish took away everything he had given her and left her with the_
_run-down hut.)_


_Think-Pair-Share_ activities encourage students’ active involvement in class
discussions by having them think through their answers to questions,
rehearse their responses silently and through discussion with a peer, and
share their responses aloud with the class. It is recommended that you
model the _Think-Pair-Share_ process with another adult (or a student with
strong language skills) the first time you use it, and continue to scaffold
students to use the process successfully throughout the year.


In _Think-Pair-Share_ activities, you will begin by asking students to listen
to the question you pose. You will then allow students some time to think
about the question and their response to the question. Next, you will prompt
students to discuss their response in pairs. Finally, you will select several
students to share their responses with the class. Directions to students
are as follows: I am going to ask you a question. I will give you a minute to
think about the question, and then I will ask you to turn to your neighbor
and discuss the question. Finally, I will call on several of you to share what
you discussed with your partner. Remember to speak clearly and at an
appropriate pace. ~~**TEKS 2.1.B; TEKS 2.1.C**~~


8. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ Do you think there is a lesson to be learned
from this story? If so, what is it? What evidence from the story helps you
determine this theme, or lesson? _(Answers may vary, but should include_
_reference to being happy, or content, with what you have. The fish took away_
_everything he had given the wife when she asked for too much.)_ ~~**TEKS 2.8.A**~~


**TEKS 2.1.B** Follow, restate, and give oral instructions that involve a short, related sequence of actions; **TEKS 2.1.C** Share
information and ideas that focus on the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using the conventions of language; **TEKS 2.8.A** Discuss topics and determine theme using text evidence with adult assistance.

**Turn and Talk:** Using what you know about the structure of
fairy tales, share with your partner how your predictions were
corrected or confirmed.


9. After hearing today’s Read-Aloud and questions and answers, do you
have any remaining questions? [If time permits, you may wish to allow for
individual, group, or class research of the text and/or other resources to
answer these questions.]


~~**WORD WORK: DISPLEASES (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard the fisherman’s wife say, “It displeases me that
the sun and moon will not rise and set at my command.”


2. Say the word _displeases_ with me.


3. Based on how the wife is acting, what do you think _displeases_ means?


4. _Displeases_ means to be unhappy or bothered about something.


5. It displeases the baseball players when their game is cancelled because of rain.


6. Tell me about something that displeases you. Try to use the word _displeases_
when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or
rephrase students’ responses: “It displeases me when . . .”]


**Use an Antonyms activity for follow-up.** What if this had been a sentence
in the story: “The wife was pleased with what the fish had given her.”? How
does your understanding of _displeases_ help you understand what the word
_pleased_ means? The prefix _dis_  - often makes a word have the opposite
meaning. _Displeases_ is the antonym, or opposite, of the word _pleases._ I am
going to read several examples. If the event or activity I describe makes you
unhappy, say, “That displeases me.” If the event or activity I describe makes
you happy, say, “That pleases me.” (Answers may vary for all.) ~~**TEKS 2.3.D**~~


    - Your best friend invites you to play.


    - You miss the bus to school.


    - Your family is having meatloaf for dinner.

What are some reasons
an emperor should be
intelligent?

You may want to
demonstrate pursing

your lips; then ask
students to try.



One day two strangers arrived in town. ~~_[Point to the two men.] Who do you_~~

~~_think these people are? What are they doing?_~~ They were swindlers, but they

said they were master weavers from a faraway land. ~~_A swindler is someone_~~

~~_who tricks people. Weavers are people who make cloth. Why would the men_~~

~~_pretend to be master weavers?_~~ They told the emperor that they could weave

the most beautiful cloth in the world. They said that not only was their cloth

beautiful, but it was also magical. It was specially woven so that only the most

**intelligent** people could see it. ~~_What do you think the word_~~ ~~intelligent~~ ~~_means?_~~


Those who were **ignorant** could stare at the cloth all day and not see a

thing. ~~_What does_~~ ~~ignorant~~ ~~_mean? What clues from the sentence help you_~~

~~_determine the meaning?_~~ ~~Ignorant~~ ~~_means not having knowledge. People_~~

~~_who do not have knowledge might look at an object for a long time without_~~

~~_understanding it._~~ ~~**TEKS 2.3.B**~~


“Astonishing!” thought the emperor. ~~Astonishing~~ ~~_means a feeling of great_~~

~~_surprise or wonder._~~ “I will have these men make a suit for me. When it is

done, I will figure out who can see it. That way I will be able to tell which of

the men who serve me are intelligent and which are fools.”


The emperor gave the swindlers a purse filled with gold coins and told them

to begin weaving the magic cloth right away. ~~_A purse is a bag that is used to_~~

~~_hold money._~~ ~~Purse~~ ~~_also means to form the lips into a tight circle or line._~~


**Show Image 2A-2: The swindlers at**

**their looms**

The swindlers set up two weaving looms and

pretended to be weaving their wonderful cloth.

But they had nothing at all on their looms.

~~_[Point to the looms.] Do you think magic cloth_~~





~~_like this really exists?_~~



**30**



After a few days, the emperor grew **curious** to see the cloth. ~~_If the emperor_~~

~~_was curious, it means he wanted to find out more._~~ At first he thought he might

check up on the weavers himself. But then he remembered what they had

said: only intelligent people could see the cloth. He was confident that he was

smart. There could be little doubt of that. But . . . what if he was not? What if

he could not see the cloth? Just to be on the safe side, he decided to send his

prime minister to have a look. ~~_The prime minister is an important advisor to_~~

~~_the emperor. He is supposed to be very wise. What do you think he will see?_~~


**TEKS 2.3.B** Use context within and beyond a sentence to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words.

“He is very intelligent,” said the king. “If he can’t see the cloth, I dare say

nobody can!”


The emperor called for the prime minister and sent him to check up on

the weavers. The prime minister went to the room and peeked in. The two

swindlers were working away at their looms.


“Prime Minister!” one of the swindlers called out. “You are welcome here! Come

in! Come in! Come and see the cloth we have produced.” The man waved his hand

at the empty loom and said, “Isn’t it beautiful?” ~~_Do you see anything on the looms?_~~


**Show Image 2A-3: The prime minister takes a**

**close look**

The prime minister squinted and rubbed his

head. He did not see any cloth at all, but he

did not dare to admit it. ~~_Why does the prime_~~

~~_minister see nothing at all?_~~ That would mean





he was a fool. So he pretended to see the cloth.



“Yes!” said the prime minister. “It is most beautiful, indeed! I like it very

much! Keep up the good work!” ~~_Does the prime minister tell the truth? Why is_~~

~~_he pretending that he sees the magical cloth?_~~


The prime minister turned to leave, but the second swindler called out to

him, “Wait! Don’t go. You must not leave without touching the cloth! I think

you will be impressed. ~~Impressed~~ ~~_means that he will admire their work. Do_~~

~~_you think he will be impressed?_~~ We were just saying that it is the softest cloth

we have ever created.”


The prime minister hesitated for a moment. Then he said, “Of course! Of

course!” and walked up to one of the looms. He reached out his hand and

rubbed his fingers together in the area where he thought the cloth must

be. He could not feel anything, but he said, “It is very soft, indeed! Why, it’s

lighter than air!” ~~_Why does the prime minister say the cloth is lighter than air?_~~


“Thank you!” said the first swindler. “We are pleased with what we have

done. And we are making very good progress, too. But we need a little more

money—for thread and other materials. Of course, you understand.”


“Of course! Of course!” said the prime minister. He reached into his pocket

and pulled out a bag of coins. Then he handed the coins to the swindlers.


The prime minister went back to the emperor and told him that the cloth

was quite lovely, and as soft as could be. He said he was confident that the

emperor would like it.


Lesson 2 The Emperor’s New Clothes
**31**


That was what the emperor had hoped to hear. The next day, he went to have

a look for himself. After all, if his prime minister had seen the cloth, surely he

could see it, too. But when he stepped into the room where the two men had

set up their looms, the emperor saw nothing on the looms.


**Show Image 2A-4: The emperor sees nothing**

~~_Look at the emperor’s face in this picture. What_~~

~~_is he thinking?_~~ “This is terrible!” he thought. “I

don’t see anything at all. What can this mean?

If the prime minister saw the cloth, it must be

there. Then why can’t I see it? Am I ignorant?





Am I unfit to be emperor? That would be the

most dreadful thing that could happen to me.”



But out loud he said, “It is magnificent! Truly magnificent! Why, I have never

seen cloth so lovely!” ~~_Why does the emperor pretend to see the cloth?_~~


“Shall we go ahead and make you a suit, then, Your Majesty?”


“Yes, yes. By all means!” said the emperor. “You can get my measurements

from the royal tailor.” ~~_Remember, a tailor is someone who makes clothes._~~


**Show Image 2A-5: The swindlers late at night**

The two swindlers sat up late into the night

pretending to work on the suit. They wove

more invisible cloth. They cut the air with

scissors and stitched the wind with threadless

needles. ~~_What clues in this paragraph help_~~





~~_you understand what the word_~~ ~~invisible~~

~~_means?_~~ ~~**TEKS 2.3.B**~~



**32**



Other noblemen came to **inspect** the cloth, and all of them pretended to be

able to see it, for they did not wish to appear ignorant. Soon the whole town

was talking about the wonderful cloth and the emperor’s new suit.


At last, the day came when the emperor was to wear his new clothes in

public.


The two swindlers presented themselves in the emperor’s dressing room at

daybreak.


**TEKS 2.3.B** Use context within and beyond a sentence to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words.

**Show Image 2A-6: The swindlers present**
**their work**

“Here is the jacket!” said the first swindler,

holding up an empty hanger.


“And here are the pants!” said the other,

holding one hand in the air. “What do you think

of them?”



All of the emperor’s men agreed that the new clothes were splendid.


The emperor took off his clothes, and the two swindlers pretended to help

him put on the make-believe garments.


“Slip your right leg in here, Your Majesty. That’s it! Now your left leg. Good.

Now I must tell you: these pants are not like regular pants. The fabric is so

light and airy that it feels like you are wearing nothing at all, but that is the

beauty of them!”


The men helped the emperor put on the imaginary clothes.


**Show Image 2A-7: The emperor admires his**
**new clothes**

Then they led him to his looking glass.


“How handsome you look, Your Majesty!”

said one of the swindlers. All of the courtiers

nodded their heads in agreement.


The emperor marched out of the dressing

room and made his way out of the palace, followed by many advisors and

servants. He marched down the main street of town, with soldiers and

bodyguards surrounding him on all sides. ~~_Why won’t anyone tell the emperor_~~

~~_that he is going for a walk in his underwear?_~~


**Show Image 2A-8: The streets lined with**

**crowds**

The streets were lined with great crowds. Everyone

had heard about the emperor’s new clothes, made

of magical fabric that only the wise could see.


“How lovely the emperor’s new clothes are!”

one man said.


“And how well they fit him!” added a woman.


Lesson 2 The Emperor’s New Clothes
**33**


None of them would admit that they could not see a thing. ~~_Why don’t the_~~

~~_people say something about the emperor being in his underwear?_~~


**Show Image 2A-9: The emperor marching**
**through the street**

The emperor marched through the street

bursting with pride, showing off his brilliant

new suit to everyone in the land. Much to his

surprise, they all seemed to see what he could





not—and so he was not going to be the one to

tell them! Just then, a young child stepped out



**34**



of the crowd and cried out, “He hasn’t got anything on!” ~~_Is the child telling_~~

~~_the truth?_~~


A hush fell over the crowd. For a few seconds, nobody said anything. Then

everyone began to whisper, “The child is right. The emperor isn’t wearing a

thing!” Then people began to giggle and laugh as they cried out, “He hasn’t

got anything on!”


At last the emperor knew he had been tricked. He tried to march back to the

palace as proudly as ever. ~~_Why do you think the emperor continues to walk_~~

~~_through town? What would you do?_~~ But he was blushing from head to toe, as

everyone could plainly see.


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


If students have difficulty responding to questions, reread pertinent lines of
the Read-Aloud and/or refer to specific images. If students give one-word
answers and/or fail to use Read-Aloud or unit vocabulary in their responses,
acknowledge correct responses by expanding students’ responses using
richer and more complex language. Ask students to answer in complete
sentences by having them restate the question in their responses.


1. **Inferential.** Why do the characters in this story pretend to see the
emperor’s new clothes? _(They want to seem intelligent.)_


2. **Literal.** What do the swindlers promise the emperor about these clothes
that intrigues him? _(They say the clothes are special; they are tailored with_
_magic, and only clever people can see them.)_


3. **Inferential.** Are people able to see the clothes? _(no)_ Why not? _(There are no_
_clothes to see; the swindlers trick everyone.)_

**Show Image 3A-1: Interior of cottage in the**

Once upon a time, in a faraway country, there

lived a **merchant** with his three daughters. ~~_A_~~

~~_merchant is a person who buys and sells goods_~~

~~_to make money._~~ The merchant was very rich.





Indeed, he had more money than he needed,

until a series of great misfortunes occurred.



~~Fortune~~ ~~_means wealth, but it also means good luck. What do you think_~~

~~misfortune~~ ~~_means?_~~ ~~(bad luck)~~ First, the merchant lost two of his biggest

ships full of cargo in a great storm at sea. Then, he was forced to give up

his lavish home in the city because he could no longer afford to pay for it.

~~_Something lavish is very expensive and fancy._~~


The merchant lost his **fortune** and was left with nothing. He told his

daughters that they would have to move to a little cottage in the woods, far

from town, and work hard and live simply. ~~_Do you think it would be difficult_~~

~~_for the merchant and his daughters to leave a life of wealth and comfort_~~

~~_and begin a life of hard work?_~~ The two older daughters complained bitterly,

for they had grown accustomed to a life of luxury. ~~_What do you think the_~~

~~_daughters miss?_~~ But the youngest daughter, who was called Beauty, always

tried to make the best of things.

Several months later, the merchant heard that one of his ships, which he

thought had been lost at sea, had in fact landed with a cargo of valuable

goods to sell. ~~_The cargo is the goods that the ship was carrying._~~


**Show Image 3A-2: Merchant leaving for the**
**city**

As the merchant prepared to make the long

trip to the city to claim his goods, he asked

his daughters what he might bring them when

he returned. The eldest daughter asked for a





fancy gown. ~~Eldest~~ ~~_means she was the oldest_~~

~~_of the sisters._~~ The second daughter asked for a



diamond necklace. But Beauty, who had plenty of things she wished for, but

none that her father’s money could buy, replied politely, “Please bring me a

rose, for I have not seen one since we came here, and I love them so much.”

~~_What kinds of things might she wish for that money can’t buy?_~~


When the merchant finally reached his ship, he found that most of his goods

had been stolen. ~~_How do you think the merchant felt to find out that his cargo_~~

~~_had been stolen?_~~ He sold what remained and made just enough money to

buy a dress for his eldest daughter and a necklace for his second daughter.

Then he set off for home. ~~_Did he forget something?_~~


**Show Image 3A-3: Snowstorm and the palace**

On the way home, snow began to fall. It

covered the road and made it hard to see.

The wind blew so hard, it almost knocked the

merchant off his horse. He was worried that

he might get lost in the blizzard. ~~_A blizzard is_~~





~~_a very big snowstorm._~~ The merchant decided

that he should stop at the next house he came



**44**



to and wait there until the storm passed.


Eventually he came upon a large palace with lights blazing. He knocked, but

no one answered. He found that the door was unlocked, so he opened it and

peered in.


“Hello!” he called out, but there was no answer. He stepped into the foyer ~~_or_~~

~~_front hall_~~ and brushed the snow off his coat.

**Show Image 3A-4: Merchant seated in large**

**dining hall**

Curious, yet hesitant, the merchant slowly

made his way into a large dining hall. To his

surprise, a fire was burning in the fireplace and

a little table had been set with a sumptuous

meal, just right for one person. ~~_[Point to the_~~

~~_food on the table.] Based on what you see in_~~



~~_this image, what does the word_~~ ~~sumptuous~~ ~~_mean? Would a sumptuous meal_~~

~~_be a simple meal or a meal with many fine foods?_~~


“Hello?” he called again. “Is anybody here?”


Again, there was no answer.


The merchant inspected the food.


“Is someone eating this food?” he asked. “Would you mind if I had a few

bites? I have been riding in a bitter snowstorm and . . .” he continued.


When there was no reply, the merchant decided that he would have a few

bites of food and then look for his gracious host.


After he had eaten, he set off to find the owner of the house to thank him.

He wandered through the rooms on the ground floor, but neither master nor

servant appeared. At last he stepped outside into a beautiful garden.

~~_or do you think this is something that normally happens?_~~ In the garden, birds

chirped. Flowers bloomed. The air was sweet and balmy. ~~Balmy~~ ~~_means the_~~

~~_weather was warm and calm._~~ The man explored the garden until he came

upon a row of beautiful rosebushes. He remembered that Beauty had asked

him to bring her a rose. He reached out to pluck a rose. But just as the stem

broke, he heard a loud roar behind him.


Lesson 3 Beauty and the Beast, Part I
**45**


“Who told you that you might gather roses in my garden?” said a low, gruff

voice.


The startled merchant turned around and saw a **fearsome** creature, who was

half man and half beast. ~~_[Point to the beast.] Based on what you know about_~~

~~_the word_~~ ~~fear~~ ~~_, what do you think the word_~~ ~~fearsome~~ ~~_means?_~~


**Show Image 3A-6: The beast confronts the**

~~_beast thought the merchant was ungrateful to_~~





~~_pick the rose after he gave the merchant a nice_~~

~~_meal and a warm place to stay._~~



Challenge


Have students explain
what motivated the
beast to give the
merchant a nice meal
and a place to wait

warm castle.



“Please forgive me,” said the merchant, falling to his knees. “I tried to find

you to thank you for the meal. I will pay you for it, if you like. As for the rose,

I only wanted it for my youngest daughter, Beauty. Her only wish when I left

her was that I return with a rose for her. Your gardens are so magnificent. I

did not think you would miss a single rose.”


“You are very ready with excuses and flattery!” Beast said. “But that will not

save you from the punishment you deserve!” ~~Flattery~~ ~~_means compliments, so_~~

~~_he was saying kind things about the beast. What do you think the beast will do_~~

~~_to the merchant?_~~


“Oh, forgive me,” said the merchant. “If not for my own sake, then for the

sake of my daughters. If I do not return home, there will be no one to support

~~_or take care of_~~ them.”


There was a long pause. Then the Beast spoke again. ~~_What do you think will_~~

~~_happen next? Will he let the merchant go?_~~


“I will forgive you,” he said, “on one condition. You must send one of your

daughters to live with me. Go and see if any of them is brave enough and

loves you enough to save you from a life in my castle! If one of them will

come, you may send her in your place. Otherwise, you must come yourself

and face your punishment.” ~~_Do you think any of the merchant’s daughters_~~

**Show Image 3A-7: The merchant gives his**
**daughters their gifts**

When the storm was over, the merchant

returned home. He gave his daughters their

presents: a gown for the eldest, a diamond

necklace for the second, and a rose for Beauty.


The older sisters were delighted, but Beauty

could sense that something was wrong.



“Father,” she said. “Why did you sigh so deeply when you gave me that

beautiful rose?”


“In a few days I will tell you,” said the merchant. “But for now, let’s just enjoy

being together again.”


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


If students have difficulty responding to questions, reread pertinent lines of
the Read-Aloud and/or refer to specific images. If students give one-word
answers and/or fail to use Read-Aloud or unit vocabulary in their responses,
acknowledge correct responses by expanding students’ responses using
richer and more complex language. Ask students to answer in complete
sentences by having them restate the question in their responses.


1. **Inferential.** What happens to the merchant’s family when he loses his
fortune? _(They become poor and find themselves living in the country as_
_peasants.)_


2. **Literal.** Who are the people in the merchant’s family? _(He has three_
_daughters, and the youngest daughter’s name is Beauty.)_


3. **Inferential.** What is magical about the beast’s palace? _(The garden is_
_untouched by the snow and bad weather.)_


4. **Evaluative.** Why is the beast described as fearsome? _(He is half man and_
_half beast; he has a low, gruff voice and gets angry at the merchant.)_ What
other words might you use to describe the beast? _(scary, sad, generous,_
_polite, etc.)_

“But I won’t allow that!” exclaimed the merchant.


“I will go,” Beauty said quietly.


“No, Beauty,” said her father. “I am the one who took the rose. I shall go back

“Good evening, Beauty,” said the beast. “Are you here to take your father’s

place and live here, with me, in the castle?”


“Yes, I am,” said Beauty.


The following day, the beast gave Beauty’s father a trunk filled with golden

coins and sent him on his way. As Beauty watched her father ride away, she

held back the tears. ~~_How do you think Beauty feels after her father says good-_~~

**Show Image 4A-4: Dinner with the beast**

“Good evening, Beauty,” said the beast.


Beauty was still startled by the beast’s

appearance, but the more time she spent with

him, the more she found that he treated her

with kindness and courtesy. He pulled out her



chair and sat next to her at dinner. He listened to her stories about her family

and spoke kindly to her while they dined. The dinner turned out to be less

painful than Beauty had imagined. When it was over and it was time to say

good-night, though, the beast turned to Beauty and asked, “Do you love me,

Beauty? Will you marry me?” ~~_Why would the beast ask her this if they just_~~

~~_met? What do you think she will say?_~~


Beauty did not know what to say. She was afraid that the beast would be

upset if she declined, ~~_or said no._~~


Seeing this, the beast said, “Say yes or no, without fear.”


Trusting his words, Beauty replied, “No, thank you,” as gently as she could.


“Very well,” said the beast. “Good night, then.”


After that, every night was much the same. Beauty dined with the beast,

and the beast treated her with great kindness. She even began to enjoy his

conversation. Little by little Beauty got used to the way he looked. **Despite**

his appearance, Beauty found the beast polite, and his elegant manners put

her fears to rest. ~~_The way he looks didn’t matter to her._~~


But when the meal was over and it was time to say good night, the beast

always turned to her and asked, “Do you love me, Beauty? Will you marry

me?”


Although she cared for him more and more with each passing day, Beauty

always felt that, as hard as it was, the only answer she could give was “No,

thank you.” ~~_Do you think she will ever marry him?_~~


One night, the beast noticed a **sorrowful** look, ~~_or one that is full of sadness,_~~

on Beauty’s face. “Beauty,” he said, “I cannot bear to see you unhappy. What

is the matter?” ~~Bear~~ ~~_means to accept. The beast does not want her to be_~~

“Dear Beast,” said Beauty softly, “I do not want to leave you. I would be very

~~_feel a strong desire to do something._~~ If you will let me go for one month, I

locket as a **constant** reminder. ~~Constant~~ ~~_means it never stops._~~ When you

want to come back, simply open the locket and say the words ‘I wish to go

back to the beast.’”


When Beauty awoke the next morning, she was in her father’s house—not the

old country cottage, but a fine new house in the city that he had bought with

the riches the beast had given him. ~~_Is Beauty’s family still penniless if she_~~

~~_finds herself in her father’s fine new home?_~~ Her father hugged her and wept

~~_or cried_~~ for joy when he saw her.

Soon Beauty’s sisters came to visit with their

new husbands. They seemed to be happy, but

Beauty could tell they were not. One sister

had married a very handsome man who was





so in love with his own face that he thought

of nothing else. The other sister had married



a clever man who entertained himself at others’ expense. ~~_Do her sisters’_~~

~~_husbands sound like nice people?_~~


Day after day, Beauty enjoyed being with her father and doing whatever she

could to help him. When the time came for her to return to the beast, she

found that she could not bring herself to say good-bye to her father. Every

day she told herself, “Today I will go back.” But every night she put it off

again. ~~_Do you think Beauty will ever return to the palace?_~~


Then one night, she dreamed that she was wandering in the garden around

the beast’s castle when suddenly she heard painful groans. She followed the

sounds and discovered the beast lying on the ground, and it seemed he was

hurting.


**Show Image 4A-7: Beauty wakes from her**

Beauty awoke with a start. ~~_The phrase “with_~~

~~_a start” means suddenly. So she woke up_~~

~~_suddenly._~~ “Oh, how could I do this to my poor

Beast?” she cried. “It does not matter that he





is not handsome. Why have I been refusing to

marry him? I would be happier with him than



with someone like my sisters have married. The beast is honest and good,

and that matters more than anything else.”


She opened the locket hanging around her neck and said firmly, “I wish to go

back to the beast.” In an instant, she found herself at the palace. But where

was the beast? ~~_What condition do you think the beast will be in when she_~~

~~_finds him? Will it be just like her dream?_~~


Beauty ran through the rooms of the castle, calling for the beast. There was

no answer. Then she remembered her dream. ~~_Where was he in her dream?_~~

She ran to the garden, and there she found the beast stretched out on the

ground.


**Show Image 4A-8: Beauty and the beast in**

**the garden**

Beauty cried, “Oh no, he is—” She couldn’t

bring herself to finish the sentence. “It is all my

fault!” She fell to the ground and took him in

her arms. The beast lay still as Beauty’s tears





fell upon his face. Then he slowly opened his

eyes.



“Oh, Beast,” Beauty sobbed, “How you frightened me! Thank goodness you

are still alive. I never knew how much I loved you until now, when I feared it

was too late.” ~~_Beauty’s tears brought the beast back to life._~~

In a faint voice the beast said, “Beauty, I was dying because I thought you

had forgotten your promise. But you have come back. Can you really love

such a dreadful creature as I am?”


“Yes!” said Beauty. “I do love you!”


Then once again the beast asked, “Beauty, will you marry me?” ~~_What do you_~~

~~_think Beauty will say this time?_~~


“Yes,” she answered. “Yes, Beast, I will marry you!”


Before she finished speaking, a flash of light beamed around her.


Beauty gasped and covered her eyes to shield them from the bright light.

When she opened her eyes again, she no longer saw the beast. But there,

lying at her feet, was a handsome prince.

good enough to see past my appearance and into my heart.” ~~_When Beauty_~~

~~_promised to marry the beast, the spell was lifted._~~


Beauty gave the young prince her hand to help him to his feet, and they

walked side by side into the castle. They were married the very next day, with

Beauty’s whole family there to help celebrate. And they lived happily ever

after. ~~_Does this fairy tale have a happy ending?_~~


Unit 1 Fairy Tales and Tall Tales


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


If students have difficulty responding to questions, reread pertinent lines of
the Read-Aloud and/or refer to specific images. If students give one-word
answers and/or fail to use Read-Aloud or unit vocabulary in their responses,
acknowledge correct responses by expanding students’ responses using
richer and more complex language. Ask students to answer in complete
sentences by having them restate the question in their responses.


1. **Literal.** Who is the royal character in this fairy tale? _(the beast)_


2. **Inferential.** How does the beast reassure Beauty that he is not as fearsome
as she thinks? _(He has polite manners and is able to keep up a pleasant_
_conversation.)_


3. **Inferential.** What request does the beast grant, or give, Beauty after she
decides to stay with him at his palace? _(to go home and see her father)_ Why
does this request make a sorrowful look come over Beast’s face? _(He doesn’t_
_think Beauty will come back, or thinks that she will forget about him.)_


4. **Literal.** What causes Beauty to put off her promise to Beast when she
returns to visit her family? _(She couldn’t bring herself to say good-bye to her_
_father.)_ What causes Beauty to decide to return to Beast? _(She has a dream_
_that the beast is sick, and she realizes that she cares about him.)_


5. **Inferential.** How do Beauty’s tears help Beast? _(They bring him back to life.)_
How does it help the beast when Beauty says that she loves him? _(It breaks_
_the spell and turns him back into a prince.)_


6. **Evaluative.** Why do you think the fairy put the spell on the beast? _(Answers_
_may vary, but prompt students to discuss that she wanted to show that the_
_way people treat others is more important than how they look.)_


7. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ What is the lesson we can learn from this
story? Based on that lesson, what would you say is the theme of this story?
_(Answers may vary, but prompt students to discuss that how someone acts_
_toward others is more important than how they look.)_

It is important to help
students understand
the difference between
the literal meanings
of the words and the
implied or figurative
meanings.



**Language:** Students will identify and use the proverb “better late than never” and
the idiom “in the nick of time,” and explain the meaning of each in context.

~~**TEKS 2.3.D**~~


**Language:** Students will demonstrate an understanding of the multiple-meaning
word _tunes._

~~**TEKS 2.3.A**~~


~~**SAYINGS AND PHRASES (10 MIN.)**~~


**Proverbs and Idioms**

  - Explain that proverbs are short, traditional sayings that have been passed
along orally from generation to generation. These sayings usually express
general truths based on experiences and observations of everyday life.


  - Explain that idioms are short sayings that cannot be understood from the
meaning of each individual word they contain. Rather, the entire saying
develops a specific meaning over time as more and more people use it.


  - Explain that some proverbs have literal meanings—that is, they mean exactly
what they say—but many proverbs have a richer meaning beyond the literal
level, or the actual words that are used. Idioms, on the other hand, never have
literal meanings. Idioms always mean something beyond the actual words
that are used.


  - Ask students if they have ever heard anyone say “better late than never.”
Have students repeat the saying. Explain that this saying means it is better to
be late in doing something than to never do it at all.


  - Ask students if they have ever heard anyone say “in the nick of time.” Have
students repeat the saying. Tell them that this saying is an idiom that means
just before the last possible second before it’s too late.


  - Remind students that in today’s Read-Aloud, Beauty left the palace of the
beast and returned home to her father and sisters in order to say good-bye
to them and the life she had known. The beast told her to come back in one
month, but Beauty could not bring herself to say good-bye to her father. It
wasn’t until Beauty had a terrible dream about the beast that she returned

to his palace. When Beauty found the beast, she was almost too late, but she
arrived there just in time to revive him with her tears. Tell students that one
could use the proverb “better late than never” or the idiom “in the nick of
time” to describe Beauty’s timely arrival at the beast’s palace.


  - Ask students if they have ever been late in doing something, but realized
that it was better to be late than to not do it at all. Then ask them if they have
ever arrived somewhere or done something right before it was too late. Give
students the opportunity to share their examples, using the new proverb and
idiom they learned. Encourage them to explain the meaning of the proverb
and idiom in the context of their own experiences. ~~**TEKS 2.3.D**~~


Check for Understanding


**Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down:** As your classmates explain the
meaning of “better late than never” and “in the nick of time” in the
context of their own experiences, give a thumbs-up if you agree
that the situation is a good example of the proverb or idiom. Give
a thumbs-down if you disagree that the situation being described
is a good example of the proverb or idiom. ~~**TEKS 2.3.D**~~


~~**MULTIPLE-MEANING WORD ACTIVITY (10 MIN.)**~~


**Tunes**

  - Show Poster 2M ( _Tunes_ ) and remind students that they heard in the ReadAloud: “[Beauty] went for a walk in the lovely gardens, where songbirds
chirped her favorite tunes.” Here _tunes_ means songs that are played or sung.


  - Have students hold up one or two fingers to show the correct picture for this
sense of the word. _(1)_


  - _Tunes_ also means to make small changes to something in order to make it
work better, such as a car or bike.


  - Have students hold up one or two fingers to show the correct picture for this
sense of the word. _(2)_


  - Have students work with a partner to create a sentence for each meaning of
_tunes_ . Remind them to be as descriptive as possible, and use complete sentences.


  - Call on a few student pairs to share one or all of their sentences. Have them
point to the part of the poster that relates to their use of _tunes_ .

**Student-Created Books**


Materials: Booklet

 - Have each student make his or her own book that is a retelling of one of
the three fairy tales from this unit. Have students brainstorm the sequence
of events—a beginning, a middle, and an end—either as a class or with a
partner. Also, talk about the various fairy tale elements. Students will draw
a picture on each page to show the beginning, important middle events, and
ending of the fairy tale. Students should also write a sentence to go with each
picture. Have students share their retellings with a partner or with the class.

 - Have a group of students plan and then act out any one of the fairy tales
covered in the unit thus far. They may choose “The Fisherman and his
Wife,” “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” or “Beauty and the Beast.” Encourage
students to use unit-related vocabulary in their dialogue.


**Characters, Setting, Plot**


Materials: Drawing paper, drawing tools

 - Divide students into groups of three. Tell them that you are going to name a
character and that one person in each group should draw or write the name
of another character from the same fairy tale and pass the paper and pen to
the second student. The second student should draw or write the name of a
setting from that fairy tale and pass the paper and pen to the third student.
The third student should write one sentence or key phrase about the plot of
the fairy tale and raise their hand once they are finished.


Unit 1 Fairy Tales and Tall Tales


**Sayings and Phrases: “Don’t Judge a Book by Its Cover”**

never” in conjunction with “Beauty and the Beast,” there is another saying
that summarizes the lesson in that fairy tale. Share with students the saying
“don’t judge a book by its cover.” Tell students to think about the fairy tale
“Beauty and the Beast” and then to think about the saying. Ask students
what they think the phrase means, how it relates to “Beauty and the Beast,”
and in what other situations it might apply.


**Writing Prompts**

  - Students may be given an additional writing prompt such as the following:


    - If a magic fish could grant me a wish, I would wish for . . .

#### Introducing the Read-Aloud


**Speaking and Listening:** Students will describe a situation that contains
exaggeration and decode and spell words ending in _–er_ and _–est_ .

~~**TEKS 2.1.D; TEKS 2.2.B.vi; TEKS 2.2.C.vi; TEKS 2.3.C**~~


~~**INTRODUCING TALL TALES (5 MIN.)**~~




  - Tell students that the next several Read-Alouds they will hear are tall tales.
Explain that tall tales are a type of folktale, which is a type of fiction.


  - Explain that the tall tales were first told orally many, many years ago, and
they were later written down.


  - Explain that tall tales are humorous, or funny, stories, and are sometimes
about real-life heroes of the American frontier during the 1800s.


~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION OR TERMS (5 MIN.)**~~


**Words that End in –er and –est**

  - Tell students that suffixes are word parts added to the end of a base word to
change the meaning of the word. Some suffixes include _–s, –es, –ing, –ed,_
_–er, –est,_ and _–ly_ . Each of these suffixes is one syllable.


  - Explain that we can decode, or read, words with suffixes by segmenting and
blending the sounds and using the syllable chunking method.


  - The ending _–er_ is used to compare two things. Write _small/smaller_ on
the board.


  - The ending _–est_ compares more than two things. Write _small/smallest_ on
the board.


  - Use the chunking method to decode words with suffixes: _cold, colder, coldest._
If possible, use different color markers to mark base words and suffixes.


**TEKS 2.1.D** Work collaboratively with others to follow agreed-upon rules for discussion, including listening to others, speaking
when recognized, making appropriate contributions, and building on the ideas of others; **TEKS 2.2.B.vi** Decoding words with
prefixes including un-, re-, and dis-, and inflectional endings, including -s, -es, -ed, -ing, -er, and -est; **TEKS 2.2.C.vi** Spelling
words with prefixes, including un-, re-, and dis-, and inflectional endings, including -s, -es, -ed, -ing, -er, and -est; **TEKS 2.3.C**
Identify the meaning of and use words with affixes un-, re-, -ly, -er, and -est (comparative and superlative), and -ion/tion/sion.


Unit 1 Fairy Tales and Tall Tales



**76**


  - Write _colder_ on the board. Then say, “Let’s decode a word with a suffix. I see
the ending _–er_ . I am going to draw a line between the base word _cold_ and the
suffix _–er._ Say it with me: _colder_ .”


  - Ask students how the meaning of the word changed. _(something that is_
_colder is more cold than something else)_


  - Repeat with _coldest_ . Elicit that _coldest_ means something that is the most
cold.


  - Tell students that in tall tales, words with _–est_ are often used to show
exaggeration.


**Show Image 5A-3: The world’s biggest lumberjack**

  - Tell students that the main character in today’s tall tale, Paul Bunyan, was a
famous lumberjack, or logger.


  - Explain that Paul Bunyan is a fictional character and that much of what they
hear about him in today’s Read-Aloud will be exaggeration. Explain that an
important characteristic of all tall tales is exaggeration of details.


  - Ask students to say the word _exaggeration_ with you. Explain that an
exaggeration is an overstatement of the truth. Exaggeration in a tall tale
makes the main character seem larger than life; he or she is always bigger,
stronger, smarter, and faster than real people.


  - Share some examples of exaggeration (e.g., someone catching a small fish,
and each time he or she tells a story about the experience, the fish gets
bigger and bigger; etc.).


Check for Understanding


**Turn and Talk:** Work with a partner to create two versions of a
situation: one that contains exaggeration and one that is more
realistic and does not contain exaggeration.


[Have students share their situations with the class, and have the
rest of the class determine whether the given situation is one that
contains exaggeration or one that does not contain exaggeration.]

Paul was so big it caused some problems in the little town in Maine where he

grew up. When he sneezed, he blew the birds from Maine to California. When

he snored, the neighbors ran out of their houses hollering, “Earthquake!

These are exaggerations

seem larger than life.

After that, Paul’s father thought it might be

better if Paul didn’t sleep in town. He built a

cot on a large raft for Paul and floated it off the

coast. Paul slept on the raft for a few nights,

but the floating cot didn’t work out. When Paul

turned over in his sleep, he created gigantic

waves that knocked down houses along the



coast. ~~_[Point to the raft.] Would parents really put their baby on a floating raft_~~

~~_to sleep in the harbor?_~~


Eventually, Paul’s father decided that the East Coast was just too small for Paul

Bunyan. The only sensible thing to do was to move out west. So the Bunyan family

moved to Minnesota. ~~_If Paul was too big for the East Coast, why do you think his_~~

~~_father thought it would be better out west? Why were people moving west?_~~


In those days Minnesota was full of logging camps, sawmills, and

lumberjacks. ~~_A lumberjack is someone who cuts down trees. The sawmill is_~~

~~_where the trees are turned into boards. People use the wood from trees to_~~

~~_build houses and to make many other things._~~ Americans were moving west

and “building the country.” They had to cut down a lot of trees to make their

homes, not to mention their schools, churches, boats, and furniture.


**Image 5A-3: The world’s biggest lumberjack**

When he grew up, Paul Bunyan went to work

as a lumberjack, and what a lumberjack he

proved to be! He made himself a giant ax, with

a handle carved out of a full -grown hickory

tree. He could bring down a giant tree with a

~~_an ax with the top of a tree or chop down a giant tree with one swing of his ax?_~~


As the tree tipped over, he would yell, “Timber!” so the other lumberjacks

had time to get out of the way.


Everyone looked up to Paul Bunyan—way up! The other lumberjacks were

full of **admiration** for him. ~~Admiration~~ ~~_means they thought very highly of him._~~

The bosses were grateful for the amazing amount of work he could do in a

day. Paul had a big heart, too, but one thing he always wished for was a true

friend. There simply wasn’t anybody else his size who could be his friend.


That all changed during the Winter of the Big Blue Snow. It was called the

Winter of the Big Blue Snow because it was so cold that everyone shivered

and turned blue. Even the snow shivered and turned blue. ~~_Do you think the_~~

~~_snow really turned blue?_~~


One day, as Paul made his way through the blue snowdrifts, he heard a muffled

whimper. ~~_If the whimper was muffled, could he hear it very well?_~~ He followed

the noise until he saw two big, blue, furry things sticking up out of the snow. He

reached down and gave a pull. ~~_What do you think was in the snow?_~~


**Show Image 5A-4: Paul meets the baby**

**blue ox**

It turned out that the two big, blue, furry

things were two big, blue ears. And connected

to the big, blue ears was a giant, blue, baby ox!





Paul exclaimed, “The poor little fellow is half

frozen.”



**80**



Paul carried the blue ox home, wrapped him in blankets, and fed him. The

baby ox was so content that he took a long nap in Paul’s big, strong arms.

When he woke up, he looked up at Paul and do you know what he said?

“Mama! Mama!” Then he gave Paul a big, slobbery lick on the face. Paul

laughed and said, “Babe, we’re gonna be great friends!”


And they were. In fact, Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox were soon

**inseparable** . ~~Inseparable~~ ~~_means they couldn’t be separated._~~ Everywhere Paul

went, Babe went, too. The two of them worked together in the lumber camps.

Paul chopped down the trees. Then Babe hauled them to the river and dropped

them in so they could float downstream to a sawmill. ~~_Remember that in order_~~

~~_for settlers to farm new land, they sometimes had to prepare it for growing_~~

~~_crops and building homes. They often did this by clearing the trees away from_~~

~~_want to keep Paul Bunyan happy?_~~ The cook’s

name was Sourdough Sam. ~~_Sourdough is a kind_~~



~~_of bread._~~ Sourdough Sam was known for the giant flapjacks he cooked in the

world’s biggest frying pan. ~~_Flapjacks are pancakes._~~ The **colossal** pan sat on an

enormous cast-iron frame. ~~Colossal~~ ~~_means unbelievably large._~~ Every morning

Sourdough Sam would build a raging forest fire underneath the pan. Then he

would call for his two helpers, Lars Larson and Pete Peterson. Lars and Pete

would grease up the pan by tying slabs of bacon to their feet and skating

back and forth across the sizzling pan. ~~_[Point to the kitchen helpers and the_~~

~~_slabs of bacon on their feet.] Greasing a giant griddle with bacon on their_~~

~~_opportunity to fill in the word_~~ ~~exaggeration~~ ~~_.]_~~ Then Sourdough Sam would make

a giant stack of pancakes for Paul and an even larger stack for Babe.


Thanks to Sourdough Sam and his overgrown flapjacks, Babe eventually grew

to be even bigger than Paul. He was so big that if you were standing at his front

legs, you had to use a telescope to see all the way to his back legs. In fact, he

was so heavy that his footprints filled up with water and turned into lakes.

~~_Babe making lakes with his footprints sounds like an example of an_~~ ~~_._~~ In

fact, there are more than ten thousand lakes in Minnesota today, and most of

them were created by Babe the Blue Ox back in the **frontier** days.

Babe and Paul helped the lumberjacks solve

all sorts of problems. Once there was a river

that was full of twists and turns. Sometimes

the trees would get stuck in the turns and





never make it downstream to the sawmill. But

Paul Bunyan thought of a way to fix that! He



went to one end of the river and sent Babe to the other end. Paul grabbed the

direction. Then—snap! Just like that, all of the kinks were pulled out, and the

river was as straight as an ax handle. ~~_Paul and Babe straightening a river is_~~

~~_another example of what?_~~


Of course, this tightening operation left the river a good deal longer than

it had been before, and there was a lot of extra water lying around. Paul

and Babe worked together to dig five big holes to hold all the extra water.

Nowadays these are called the Great Lakes. ~~_Did Paul Bunyan actually create_~~

~~_the Great Lakes? This is definitely another_~~ ~~_._~~


One day, the logging bosses got to talking. One of them said that the

United States was a fine country, to be sure, but it could still stand a little

improvement. For one thing, it could use a few more rivers. And what it really

needed was a big river running right down the middle of the country, all the

way from Minnesota down to New Orleans. “If we had a river like that,” the

man said, “we could ship timber down to New Orleans and all around the

world!” ~~_What river do you think they are talking about?_~~


**Show Image 5A-7: Paul and Babe heading**
**west**

Paul Bunyan happened to overhear this

conversation. He told the bosses he would see

what he could do. He hitched up Babe and they

started plowing south. As they plowed, they





threw a great mound of dirt and rocks to the

right and a smaller mound to the left. On the

right side they made the Rocky Mountains, and on the left side they made

the Appalachian Mountains. Paul Bunyan and Babe didn’t stop until they had

plowed a channel all the way south to the Gulf of Mexico. And the river that

flows in that channel nowadays, that’s what we call the Mississippi River.

~~_The Mississippi River was a very important means of transportation in frontier_~~

~~_days and still is today._~~


From that day on, Paul and Babe went around the country, using their

size and strength to help anyone who needed it. Later, they dug the Grand

Canyon as they made their way to the West Coast of California. ~~_Did Paul_~~

**Regular and Irregular Plurals**

 - Review that nouns can be people, places, or things.


 - Explain that when someone is talking about one of something, it is called
a singular noun. _Singular_ means only one. When someone is talking about
more than one of something, it is a plural noun. _Plural_ means two or more.

Using the items you
brought in for display
(books, keys, boxes),
demonstrate the
concepts of singular and
plural. Be sure the plural
of each object is a regular
plural (i.e., has the /s/,
/z/, or /ez/ sound).


**86**




- Tell students that most nouns become plural by adding the /s/ or /z/ sound,
like _one cat_ and _two cats_ or _one dog_ and _two dogs_ . Sometimes, the /ez/
sound is added if the word ends in a /s/, /z/, /ch/, or /sh/ sound, like _one_
_kiss_ and _two kisses_ .


Unit 1 Fairy Tales and Tall Tales


- Review this concept by providing students the following examples of singular
nouns and having them provide the plural.


  - One student > Two students


  - One book > Two books


  - One school > Two schools


  - One dish > Two dishes


  - One prince > Two princes


  - One box > Two boxes


  - One house > Two houses


- Explain that there are some nouns that are different, or tricky, when there is
more than one of the item. These nouns are called “irregular plural nouns.”
They are irregular because the plural form is not created with the addition of
/s/, /z/, or /ez/.


- Review irregular plural nouns with the following examples:


  - One child > Two children


  - One foot > Two feet


  - One tooth > Two teeth


  - One mouse > Two mice


  - One man > Two men


  - One ox (like Babe!) > Two oxen


- Tell students that the more they listen to stories and hear these irregular
plural nouns, the more they will remember them and use them when they
talk.


- Have students work in partners to make up sentences about how two
children are the same, and how they are different. Encourage students to use
the correct singular and plural forms, _child_ and _children_, when making up
their sentences.


- As time permits, have students create sentences about the irregular plural
nouns they learned about and share their sentences with the class.



Support


If students have
difficulty saying the
irregular plural form
of each word, provide
them with the incorrect
form for contrast. For
example, you might
ask students, “Should
we say, ‘two childs’ or

students in recognizing
that the plural form of
_child_ is _children,_ not
_childs._

 - Explain that the character Pecos Bill is a cowboy, and that cowboys are men
who work on a ranch—or an area where cattle graze—and take care of the
cattle. Cowboys were common on the frontier because many people raised
cattle for food, sold their milk, or sold the cattle to make money.

nobody noticed. The wagon just kept on going.
So Little Bill found himself sitting in the dirt

along the banks of the Pecos River, ~~_a real river_~~

~~_in Texas,_~~ and that’s how he came to be named
Pecos Bill. But that was later.



Little Bill was not your average baby. He didn’t cry. He just crawled along on
the dusty plain, keeping his eyes peeled for whatever came along. And the
first thing to come along was a coyote.


When the coyote saw this dirty little creature crawling around on all fours,
she thought he was a cute little animal, even if his ears were mighty small.
Little Bill reached up and patted the coyote’s head and said, “Nice doggie!”

~~_Do you think these things really happened, or are they exaggerations?_~~


**Show Image 6A-3: Young Bill howls at the**
**moon with coyote pups**


The doggie—I mean coyote—liked Little Bill.
She took him home and raised him with her

pups. ~~_Baby coyotes are called pups. What_~~

~~_animal do you think coyotes are like?_~~ The
coyotes taught Bill to roam the prairies and
howl at the moon. They taught him the secrets
of hunting, how to leap like an antelope, and to run like the wind. They taught

him how to chase lizards and lie so still that he was almost invisible. ~~_Do you_~~

~~_think a young boy can really become a member of a coyote pack, or is this an_~~

~~_exaggeration? This humorous detail makes Bill seem larger than life. This is_~~

Lesson 6 Pecos Bill
**95**


**96**



The years went by—eighteen of them to be exact—and Bill grew up strong and
healthy. One day he was out hunting along the Pecos River when he saw a most
unusual sight. It seemed to be a big animal with four legs. Or was it six legs? And

why did it have one head in front and another on top? ~~_What do you think Bill sees?_~~


**Image 6A-4: Bill meets a man on a horse**


Well, it turned out to be a horse with a man
riding it, something Bill had never seen before.
Bill scurried around the horse a few times.
Then he slowly crept forward and took a sniff
of the man’s boot.


“Boy,” said the man, “what are you doin’
scampering around down there?”


“Sniffin’” said Bill. “I’m a coyote!”


“No, you ain’t,” said the man. “You’re a man, like me.”


“Nooo!” howled Bill. “Coyoteeeee!” ~~_Why does Bill think he is a coyote? [Point_~~

~~_to the man in the illustration.] Do you think the cowboy believes him?_~~


“What makes you think you are a coyote?” said the man.


“I have fleas!” said Bill.


“So what?” said the man. “Lots of men here in Texas have fleas.”


But Bill was not **persuaded** ~~_or convinced._~~ He was sure he was a coyote.


“Here’s the thing,” said the man. “Coyotes have pointy ears and big bushy
tails. And you don’t.”


**Show Image 6A-5: Pecos Bill looks for his tail**


“Yes, I do!” cried Bill. He felt sure he had a tail,
just like all the other coyotes. He looked over
his shoulder but couldn’t see one. He reached
back to grab his tail, but he could not feel one.
He backed up to the river and looked for his
tail in the reflection, but it was not there.


Unit 1 Fairy Tales and Tall Tales


Bill was surprised. He thought for a moment. Then he decided the man must
be right. If he didn’t have a tail, he couldn’t be a coyote. If he wasn’t a coyote,
he must be a man.


Bill decided he’d have to say farewell to his four-legged friends and try
living as a man. He went to stay with the man, who just so happened to be a
cowboy.


**Show Image 6A-6: Pecos Bill and the cowboy**
**at the campfire**


The man gave Bill some clothes to wear and
a horse to ride. He also gave him a nickname:

Pecos Bill. ~~_Why did the man call him Pecos Bill?_~~
At first Bill had trouble living like a man. He

and pulled at his skin, or the way his boots
came between his bare feet and the good, old dirt. And he couldn’t see the
need for a knife or fork when it was just as easy to use your fingers to pick up





your meat and tear it with your teeth. ~~_In the rest of the story, the author will_~~

~~_sometimes use the name_~~ ~~Bill~~ ~~_and other times use the nickname_~~ ~~Pecos~~ ~~Bill~~ ~~_._~~


Bill learned to act like a man, but he still had a spark of wildness in him, and
it would flash out from time to time. One day he was out riding on his horse
when he was surprised by a mountain lion. The mountain lion scared Bill’s
horse away and charged right at Bill. But Pecos Bill was too quick for that
mountain lion. He dodged the big cat, then hopped right onto his back.


**Show Image 6A-7: Pecos Bill rides a**
**mountain lion**





The mountain lion was not happy, no sir. He
bucked. He snarled. He tried to twist around
and bite Bill. Bill held on to the lion’s neck with
one hand. With his other hand, he waved his
cowboy hat in the air and shouted, “Yahoo!”



The mountain lion did everything he could to shake Bill off, but it was no use.
Finally, he gave in and let Bill ride him. Then, Bill put a saddle on the lion and
rode him like a horse. Bill had **tamed** the mountain lion.


Another day, Pecos Bill was attacked by a giant rattlesnake. This particular
rattlesnake was a mean old fellow who thought he was the king of the


Lesson 6 Pecos Bill
**97**


whole desert. He struck at Bill’s heel, but Pecos Bill was too quick for that
rattlesnake.


**Show Image 6A-8: Pecos Bill tickling a giant**
**rattler**


Pecos Bill grabbed the rattler by the neck and
squeezed him hard. The snake wriggled and
writhed in Bill’s grip.





“Say ‘uncle’ if you’ve had enough!” said Bill.



“G-g-g-uncle!” said the snake, gurgling out the sounds as best as he could.


Bill **relaxed** his grip ~~_or loosened his hold_~~ a bit and asked the rattler, “Who’s
the boss around here?”


“I was . . .” said the snake. “But now you are.”


“Well then,” said Pecos Bill, “how’d you like to work for me?”


“Sure thing!” said the rattler. The rattler just looked at Pecos Bill with
admiration and purred like a kitten. ~~_You learned the word_~~ ~~admiration~~ ~~_in a_~~
~~_previous lesson. What does_~~ ~~admiration~~ ~~_mean?_~~ ~~(a feeling of deep respect and~~
~~liking)~~ Pecos Bill had squeezed all the meanness right out of that snake!

~~_Would you call this an amazing feat? Do you think Bill really squeezed all of_~~

~~_the poison out of the snake, or is this an exaggeration?_~~


**Show Image 6A-9: Pecos Bill ropes a cow**
**with his rattlesnake lasso**


Next, Pecos Bill rolled the rattler up into a coil
and rode away on his mountain lion. On the
way back to camp, he spotted a runaway cow.
He grabbed the rattler and tied a loop at one





end of him to make a lasso. ~~_A lasso is a rope_~~

~~_tied in a circle to catch a cow._~~



**98**



Then he rode after the cow, swinging his lasso above his head. When he was
close enough, he tossed the looped end of the snake over the cow. Pecos
Bill jumped off the mountain lion and pulled the lasso tight, stopping the
runaway cow right in his tracks.


Unit 1 Fairy Tales and Tall Tales


Pecos Bill brought the cow back to his friend, the cowboy. After that he
taught all the cowboys at the ranch how to use a lasso to catch a runaway

cow. ~~_Bill just invented catching cattle with ropes! Could a cowboy really rope a_~~

~~_cow with a rattlesnake? This is another_~~ ~~_._~~ He taught them other things,
too. He taught them how to tame wild horses by riding them, just as he had

done with the mountain lion. ~~Tame~~ ~~_means to train to obey people._~~ He even
taught them how to sing cowboy songs around the campfire at night, in a

voice that sounded a lot like a lonesome coyote howling at the moon. ~~_Why do_~~

~~_you suppose Bill’s voice sounded like a coyote howling at the moon?_~~


Pecos Bill was famous for his riding skills. He once rode a wild mustang
called the Backbreaker that no one else could ride. But that story pales in
comparison to the time he rode something that no other man had before,

and I reckon no man ever will again—a cyclone! ~~_A cyclone is a real storm,_~~

~~_like a tornado. Do you think a man would be able to ride a cyclone, or is this_~~

~~_an_~~ ~~_? [Pause to let students fill in the word_~~ ~~exaggeration.~~ ~~_]_~~


**Show Image 6A-10: Pecos Bill rides a cyclone**



Challenge


Have students describe
what a coyote might
sound like, using
descriptive language.





That’s right. Pecos Bill lassoed a cyclone
with his rattlesnake lasso and jumped on its
rip-roaring back. The cyclone spun furiously,
trying to throw Bill off. It went spinning this
way and that way across the deserts of
Arizona, trying to knock Bill off by rising up
into the air and digging down into the ground.



Pecos Bill didn’t let go until the cyclone spun itself out of **energy**, and by that

time the two of them had carved out a deep canyon. ~~Energy~~ ~~_means the power_~~

~~_to keep moving._~~ If you ever go to Arizona, you can still see that canyon today.

It’s called the Grand Canyon. ~~_Did Bill really build the Grand Canyon, or might_~~

~~_this be an_~~ ~~_? Which other tall tale hero supposedly created the Grand_~~

~~_Canyon? (Paul Bunyan)_~~

~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION OR TERMS (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that, as people continued to move westward in the United
States, new transportation systems were being invented, and older
transportation systems became faster and less expensive. One form of
transportation that made traveling much easier was the railroad and trains.


 - Explain that tracks were laid by thousands of workers; tunnels were even
dug right through mountains, mostly by hand. Ask students if they think this
would be easy or difficult work. Tell students that soon, however, machines
were invented that could do what people were doing, and the machines could
do the work easier and faster.


 - Explain that the tall tale students will hear today is interesting because for
more than 100 years, we didn’t know if the character of John Henry was a
real person. Tell students that for many years people believed John Henry
was a fictional hero and a symbol for those who worked laying railroad tracks,
but today some historians, or people who study history, now believe that
there was really a man named John Henry who really did lay railroad tracks,
and that the main event in this story actually happened.

~~**“JOHN HENRY” (15 MIN.)**~~


In the 1860s, the United States was growing quickly. Immigrants were pouring
in, and railroad companies were laying train tracks that would carry settlers

west. ~~_Tracks are metal bars that a train rides along. Tracks can also be left on the_~~

~~_ground by an animal or person. Why were the train tracks being built westward?_~~


One of the railroad companies was called the Chesapeake & Ohio, or the C&O
for short. The C&O Railroad was named for the two bodies of water it was
intended to connect: the Chesapeake Bay along the East Coast and the Ohio

River in the West. ~~_Today, railroads cross the whole country._~~


**Show Image 7A-1: The Appalachian**
**mountains**

The engineers who planned the C&O Railroad

had to overcome many challenges in order

to get trains from the Chesapeake Bay to the

Ohio River, but no **challenge** ~~_or problem_~~ was





greater than this: they had to run their tracks

through the Appalachian Mountains. The



Appalachians were like a big wall that separated the east from the west.


Sometimes, when the mountains were rolling, more like hills, the C&O

workers were able to lay tracks over the top of them. Other times they were

able to lay track that zig-zagged around the mountains, like a snake. But

Challenge


Have students
brainstorm possible
solutions to this
problem.



Lesson 7 John Henry
**109**


**Show Image 7A-2: A tunnel entrance in**
**the mountain**

In those cases, the only **solution** was to dig a

tunnel right through the mountain. ~~_A solution_~~

~~_is something that solves a problem._~~ Digging

tunnels was dangerous work. The tunnels were

dark and poorly ventilated. That means that

there was barely enough fresh air inside the



tunnels for the workers to breathe. Workers could be hurt by falling rocks or

by cave ins. ~~_Cave-ins are when pieces of rock fall down into a tunnel._~~ To dig

the tunnels as fast as they could, railroad workers worked in teams of two.


**Show Image 7A-3: Two-man team digging**

**holes**

One man would crouch down and hold a steel

spike. ~~_Spikes are long, thick nails used to hold_~~

~~_railroad tracks together._~~ Then the other man

would hit the spike with a big hammer. The first





man would twist the spike as much as he could.

Then his partner would hit the spike with his



hammer again. The two men would work together, banging and twisting, banging

and twisting, until they had driven the spike deep into the rock. Then they would

pull out the spike, move to another spot, and start digging a new hole. ~~_The men_~~

~~_would create a hole in the rock by hand, without the help of complex machines._~~


After a while, the rock would be full of holes, like a piece of Swiss cheese. ~~_Do_~~

~~_you know what Swiss cheese looks like?_~~


**Show Image 7A-4: Dynamite explodes to**

**break up the rock**

Next, the dynamite men would take over.

~~_Dynamite is a substance that explodes when_~~

~~_it burns. Why are these men willing to do this_~~

~~_dangerous work?_~~ The dynamite men would





pack dynamite into the holes and detonate

the explosives—KABOOM! ~~Detonate~~ ~~_means_~~



**110**



~~_to set off._~~ The explosions would break up the solid rock into rubble. Then the

workers would haul away the rubble. And then they would start digging again.


To make the long, hard day’s work go by faster, the railroad workers used to


Unit 1 Fairy Tales and Tall Tales


have contests. They would pick two teams and see which team could drive

its spike farther into the mountain in a set amount of time. The winners of

these contests became heroes. People would tell stories about these “steel
driving” men and their amazing **feats** . ~~_Feats are accomplishments that take_~~

~~_great strength and determination._~~ Another thing the railway workers did to

pass the time while they worked was sing songs. Sometimes they would even

sing songs about other steel-driving men.


One of these steel-driving men was named John Henry. No one knew for certain

where John Henry was from. Some said he was from Georgia. Some said he was

from Tennessee. Others said he was a Virginia man. He seems to have started

working on the railroads sometime after the end of the Civil War. The actual

John Henry this tale is based on was born in New Jersey.


For years people thought John Henry worked on the Big Bend Tunnel on the

C&O line in West Virginia; but now we think he more likely worked on the

Lewis Tunnel in Virginia.


**Show Image 7A-5: John Henry born with a**

**hammer in his hand**

One thing we are sure of is that John Henry

was a legend among railway workers. ~~_A legend_~~

~~_is someone who is well-known for doing_~~

~~_something extremely well. A legend is also a_~~





~~_story that explains the origin of something._~~

They sang a song that tells the story about



how he was born with a hammer in his hand. ~~_Do you think he was really born_~~

~~_with a hammer in his hand, or is this an exaggeration?_~~ John Henry became

known as the most courageous man who ever worked on the railroad. Even

as a young boy he could do the work of a man. ~~_That means that even as a boy,_~~

~~_John Henry could do the work of older men. Do you think he really could, or is_~~

~~_this an exaggeration?_~~ They said he had never been defeated in a steel-driving

competition. They said he hit the spike so hard that sparks flew through the

air. They said John Henry could swing a ten-pound hammer from sunup to

sundown and not even get tired. ~~_Could a person really do this, or might this_~~

~~_be an_~~ ~~_?_~~


At first, almost all of the work on the tunnels was done by hand by workers

like John Henry. Eventually, however, this began to change.


Lesson 7 John Henry
**111**


**Show Image 7A-6: The steam drill is invented**

People invented machines that could do

some of the work. One of the machines they

invented was a **steam** drill. This was a drill

that was powered by a steam engine. ~~_Very hot_~~

~~_water changes to steam, which is what powers_~~





~~_a steam drill._~~ The first steam drills were pretty

good, but they were not great. The steam drills



could drive a spike into the mountain for sure, but not as well as two strong,

experienced railway workers like John Henry and his partner. Over time the

machines got better and better, and they eventually began to replace the

men who worked on the railroad tunnels.


One day, the captain of John Henry’s work team brought a steam drill to the

worksite. He bet that the steam drill could drive steel better than John Henry

could. ~~_This machine was going to do the same job as John Henry and his crew—but_~~

~~_faster._~~ John Henry agreed to **compete** against the steam drill, and he swore he

would do his best to beat it. ~~Compete~~ ~~_means to have a contest to see who is better._~~


John Henry said to the captain:


_“Well, a man ain’t nothin’ but a man._


_But before I let a steam drill beat me down,_


_I’ll die with a hammer in my hand._


_Oh, oh! I’ll die with a hammer in my hand.”_ ~~_How does this text sound_~~
~~_different than the rest of the text?_~~ ~~(rhymes, repeating lines, etc.)~~

~~_[Explain that this is an excerpt from “The Ballad of John Henry.”] A_~~
~~_ballad is a kind of poem or song that tells a story._~~


**Show Image 7A-7: John Henry competes**

**against the steam drill**

One of the bosses blew a whistle. John Henry

went to work driving steel the old-fashioned

way, with a hammer and a spike. The captain

started up the steam drill. It rattled away





beside John Henry, belching steam and

banging away at the mountain. The man and


Unit 1 Fairy Tales and Tall Tales



**112**


the machine worked side by side for several hours. Then the boss blew his

whistle again.


The bosses took measurements, and then they announced the results. ~~_Who_~~

~~_do you think will win: John Henry or the steam drill?_~~ John Henry had driven

his spike a total of fifteen feet into the mountain. And the steam drill? It had

only drilled nine feet. ~~_If John Henry dug fifteen feet and the steam drill dug_~~

~~_nine feet, which one dug farther?_~~ John Henry had won! He had beaten the

steam drill!


_Now the man that invented the steam drill,_


_He thought he was mighty fine._


_But John Henry drove his fifteen feet_


_And the steam drill only made nine._


_Oh, oh! The steam drill only made nine!_ ~~_This is another excerpt from_~~
~~_“The Ballad of John Henry.” What is different about this text?_~~ ~~(rhymes,~~
~~repeating lines, etc.)~~


**Show Image 7A-8: John Henry wins the**

**competition**

The other railway workers roared. ~~_John Henry_~~

~~_received a cheer as loud as a roar._~~ They were

excited that John Henry had won. He had

shown that a hard worker was better than a





machine! And just as John Henry said, he died

with his hammer in his hand.



_John Henry hammered in the mountains,_


_And his hammer was strikin’ fire._


_Well, he hammered so hard that it broke his poor heart,_


_Then he sat down and closed his eyes._

C&O Railroad was completed a couple of years later. And for years to come,

whenever locomotives ~~_What is a locomotive?_~~ went down the C&O line past

from students to fill in each row in the “John Henry” column. For example, in
the “Amazing Childhood” row, you might suggest John Henry being born with
a hammer in his hand; the “Creations/Inventions” row will be left blank for
this lesson (although the steam drill and the railroad were central to the story
of John Henry, he didn’t invent either). In the “Amazing Adventures” row, you
might suggest John competing against a steam drill; in the “Humor” row,
have students share anything they found humorous about the tall tale; in the
“Exaggerations” row, you might suggest John Henry could do the work of a
man as a boy.

**Word Work: Challenge**

 - Remind students that they heard in the Read-Aloud, “The engineers who
planned the C&O Railroad had to overcome many challenges in order to
get trains from the Chesapeake Bay to the Ohio River, but no challenge
was greater than this: they had to run their tracks through the Appalachian
Mountains.”


 - Have students say the word _challenge_ .


 - Explain that a challenge is a difficult task or problem that takes some
thinking to figure out. For example, “Putting a puzzle together can
sometimes be a challenge.”


 - Ask students if they have ever accomplished something that at first was a
challenge. Encourage them to use the word _challenge_ when they tell about it.
Ask two or three students to share their examples. If necessary, guide and/or
rephrase students’ responses: “One challenge I accomplished was . . .”


 - Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up. Tell students you are going

correct picture for this sense of the word. _(1)_


Check for Understanding


**1, 2, 3:** The word _tracks_ can also mean other things, like the marks
left on the ground by an animal, person, or vehicle. Hold up one,
two, or three fingers to show the correct picture for this sense of
the word. _(2)_


The word _tracks_ can also mean follows or watches the path of
something. For example, the meteorologist tracks the storm to let
people know when the bad weather will arrive. Hold up one, two,
or three fingers to show the correct picture for this sense of the
word. _(3)_


 - Have students work with a partner to quiz each other on the different
meanings of the word _tracks_ . Remind them to be as descriptive as possible
and to use complete sentences. For example, they could say, “My dog went
outside for a walk after the snowstorm and his footprints left tracks where he
walked in the snow.” The partner should respond, “That’s ‘2.’”

    - In this tall tale, two men greased a colossal pan by skating across the pan
with slabs of bacon on their feet. _(“Paul Bunyan”)_


    - The main character in this tall tale competed with a steam drill and won

are always larger than life.


~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION OR TERMS (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that in the 1800s, many Americans traveled from the East
Coast of the United States, where most early settlers lived, to the West Coast.
As they traveled west, they crossed the Appalachian Mountains and the
Great Plains. Point out these areas on a U.S. map.


  - Remind students that tall tales are often set on the American frontier, the
formerly unsettled area in the western United States. Locate the state of
Kentucky on a U.S. map.


  - Explain that after tunnels were built, allowing trains to go from the eastern
United States to the new territories in the West, trains were a primary mode
of transportation for Americans. People rode on trains to get to places, and
trains were used to ship items from one part of the country to another much
faster than ever before!


  - Explain that today’s tall tale, “Casey Jones,” is about a train engineer who
drove a locomotive for the Illinois Central Railroad more than one hundred
years ago. His real name was John Luther Jones. He was from Cayce,
Kentucky (pronounced like the name _Casey_ ), so he got the nickname “Casey”
Jones. Casey Jones became well-known for his bravery and determination.

~~**“CASEY JONES” (15 MIN.)**~~


Now, gather ’round, friends, for I want to tell you a story. It’s a story of a

**legendary** engineer. ~~_If a legend is a well-known story, what does it mean to be_~~

~~_legendary?_~~ His name was Casey Jones, and there’s never been a man who could

drive a train as fast or as well. People say that Casey Jones could drive a train

before he could walk, and when he was a baby he said “choo-choo” instead of

“goo-goo.” ~~_Do you think a baby could really drive a train? This is an exaggeration._~~


**Show Image 8A-1: Casey Jones driving**

When Casey was a young man growing up in

Kentucky, the railroad was the fastest way of

getting around. ~~_Although this is a fictional tall tale,_~~

~~_Casey Jones was a real person._~~ This was back





before the days of airplanes or rocket ships. There

were no cars and trucks. There were only horse


**126**



drawn vehicles—and the mighty iron horse, as it was called: the locomotive.


Casey was an engineer for the Illinois Central Railroad. He loved to sit way

up in the cabin of the train with one hand on the whistle and one hand on

the brake. When the tracks were straight and clear, Casey would pull on the

throttle and the train would take off like a rocket shooting into space. ~~_The_~~

~~_throttle made the train go; the brake made the train stop._~~ When he came into

the station, he would pull on the brake and bring the train to a sudden stop.

Unit 1 Fairy Tales and Tall Tales


Casey loved to watch the trees and fields go whizzing by as he zoomed

through the countryside. He loved to make the train’s whistle blow—and

there was no other engineer who could blow the train whistle quite the way

Casey did. Casey’s whistle started out soft, like a whip-poor-will. ~~_A whip-_~~

~~_poor-will is a bird._~~ Then it rose to a howl, like a coyote crying in the night.

Finally, it faded away to a quiet whisper.


People in town always knew when Casey was coming. Even before they could

see his train, they could hear it. They’d hear the powerful chugga-chugga,

chugga-chugga, getting louder and louder. Then they’d hear that wild, whistle

sound.


**Show Image 8A-2: Casey Jones coming**
**through**

Some said that Casey’s whistle had magic

powers. They said that when Casey blew his

whistle, little babies would wake up from their

naps, but they wouldn’t cry. Instead, they’d





make little “chugga-chugga, whoo-whoo”

sounds, then fall right back to sleep. When



Casey blew his whistle, the cows would give an extra quart of milk, and the

chickens would lay at least a dozen eggs each. And, as the story goes, if you

cracked one of those eggs in a cold frying pan and put out a piece of plain

bread, just as soon as Casey went blazing by, there in that pan would be a

nicely fried egg, over easy, and on the side, a plate of hot buttered toast. ~~_Do_~~

~~_you think this really happened, or is this another exaggeration?_~~


Now the reason Casey drove so fast was simple: he took great **pride** in

always being on time. Casey wanted to make sure that he got that train where

it was going when it was supposed to be there, no matter what. Whenever he

started out on a run, the railroad men would wave and yell, “Bring her in on

time, Casey!” And they knew he would.


**Show Image 8A-3: Sim Webb, the fireman,**
**fuels the fire**

But Casey couldn’t make that train go that fast

with his good looks. No, Casey needed a good

fireman to help him, and he had one of the best in

Sim Webb. The fireman on a train didn’t put out





fires like you might think. The fireman’s job was to



Lesson 8 Casey Jones
**127**


keep the fire in the engine burning by shoveling coal into it. When the flames were

a-roarin’, that made a lot of steam, and that made the train go fast. ~~_Remember,_~~

~~_steam is the hot air and water particles created when water gets really hot._~~ No

doubt about it, Sim Webb was a first-rate fireman. He could shovel coal faster than

anyone on either side of the Mississippi. The faster Sim shoveled, the faster Casey

could drive the train. Sim Webb kept the fire good and hot, and Casey Jones got

their trains in on time. Together, they were an unbeatable team.


There was only one day that Casey and Sim almost didn’t make it to the

station on time. They were carrying a load of mail to Memphis, Tennessee,

and it was raining cats and dogs. ~~_Was it really raining cats and dogs? What_~~

~~_does that mean?_~~


_The rain had been falling for five or six weeks,_


_And the railroad track was like the bed of a creek._ ~~_How does this text_~~
~~_sound different than the rest of the text?_~~ ~~(end rhyme, rhythm, etc.)~~

~~_[Explain that this is an excerpt from a song about Casey Jones.] What_~~
~~_is a poem or song that tells a story called?_~~ ~~(ballad)~~


At the station in Memphis, the railroad men waited for Casey to arrive. Some

said, “There’s no way he can make it on time with all this rain. He’ll have to

slow down.” But others said, “Just you wait. He’ll make it. Casey Jones always

makes it on time.”


And sure enough, just then they saw a light on the tracks up ahead, and

heard the lonesome whistle that could only be Casey Jones. The train pulled

into the station, dripping wet, puffing hard, but right on time.


Casey and Sim were dog-tired and more than ready for a good night’s sleep.

But they’d hardly settled into their beds when there was a knock at the door.

Word came that the engineer who was supposed to drive the train on the

southbound run was sick.


**Show Image 8A-4: Casey Jones back to work**

Well, they didn’t even have to ask Casey if he

would take the man’s place. Tired as he was,

Casey got dressed and headed for the station.

And when he got there, he found Sim Webb,

already stoking the fire with coal, getting the





train ready to carry mail, packages of freight,

and **passengers** as well.


Unit 1 Fairy Tales and Tall Tales



**128**


Now, friends, here’s where I have to tell you the sad part of this story, about

how Casey met his end. As Casey **mounted** ~~_or climbed into_~~ the cabin and

took the throttle in his hand, he heard someone shout, “Casey, you’re already

more than an hour and a half late.” But Casey just smiled and thought to

himself, “I guess that means I’ll have to go just a little faster.” ~~_Do you think_~~

~~_that is a good idea?_~~


Casey opened up the throttle and the train plunged into the dark, wet night.

~~Opened up the throttle~~ ~~_means he was going full speed ahead._~~ Sim Webb

shoveled the coal with all his might, and the train chugged on, faster and

faster.


**Show Image 8A-5: One hand on the brake**

“Casey!” Sim yelled. “You’re running too fast.”


_But Casey said, “Fireman, don’t you fret,_





_Keep knockin’ at the fire door, and don’t_
_give up yet._


_I’m gonna run this train until she leaves the_
_rail_



_Or we make it on time with the southbound mail.”_ ~~_This is another_~~
~~_excerpt from “The Ballad of Casey Jones.” How does this text sound_~~
~~_different than the rest of the text?_~~ ~~(end rhyme, rhythm, etc.)~~


They drove on. The train gained speed until it was flying faster than the

speed of light. ~~_Do you think the train was going faster than the speed of light?_~~


_Then Casey said, “I believe we’ll make it through,_


_For the engine is a-steamin’ better than I ever knew!”_


Casey got the signal that the tracks were clear up ahead, so he was

“highballing” down the tracks, pushing that train just as fast as it would go.

~~Highballing~~ ~~_is a train term for “all clear, full speed ahead”._~~ He was going so

fast that it looked like they might even make it on time. Just then, as they

squealed around a curve, through the darkness, Casey saw a light up ahead.

He knew that light wasn’t supposed to be there, not on this track.


Lesson 8 Casey Jones
**129**


**Show Image 8A-6: Jump, Sim, jump!**

At that moment, Casey knew. There was a

broken-down freight train stuck on the track

just ahead, and he was speeding straight

toward it!


Casey pulled the brake as hard as he could,

and yelled to his partner, “Jump, Sim!”



“Casey, you come on!” replied Sim.


“Jump!” Casey shouted, and in the blink of an eye Sim jumped. But Casey

stayed on the train. He knew that he could not stop the train in time, but he

knew that he had to slow it down. He knew that if he jumped and let go of the

brake, his train would crash into the other train at a dangerously high speed.


**Show Image 8A-7: Two hands on the brake**

So Casey pulled on the brake with all his

might. A terrible screeching, squealing sound

ripped through the darkness. Then came the

crash.





_The trains, they met in the middle of a hill_

_In a head-on tangle that was bound to spill._

_Casey Jones was a very brave man._


Poor Casey! When they found him, they said he had one hand still on the

brake and one hand tight on the whistle: trying to stop his train as best he

could and give warning to the other train. Casey’s bravery that night saved all

of the passengers on both trains, and his fireman Sim. ~~_Sim Webb survived the_~~

~~_crash and was very proud of Casey Jones’s heroism. Sim held a great deal of_~~

~~_admiration for Casey Jones. Do you think Casey Jones was a hero?_~~


Unit 1 Fairy Tales and Tall Tales



**130**


After that, thanks to Sim Webb keeping the story alive, people would tell

stories about the brave engineer named Casey Jones. They even made up

songs about him. You’ve already heard some parts of one of those songs.

Here’s another part:


_Casey Jones—mounted to the cabin._


_Casey Jones—throttle in his hand._


_Casey Jones mounted to the cabin._


_Took a trip to the Promised Land._ ~~_This is the end of “The Ballad of_~~

**Show Image 8A-8: Shooting star in the night**

They say that if you look up in the sky on a

clear night and see a flash of light across

the sky—well, that might be a shooting star.

But then again, it might be Casey Jones,

roaring across the sky, chugga-chugga,





chugga-chuggin’—on time—till the end of

 - Have each student make their own book that is a retelling of one of the four
tall tales from this unit. Have students brainstorm the sequence of events—a
beginning, a middle, and an end—either as a class or with a partner. Also,
discuss the various tall tale elements. Students will draw a picture on each
page to show the beginning, important events, and ending of the tall tale.
Encourage students to draw exaggerated pictures like the illustrations they
saw in the trade books. Students should also write a sentence to go with
each picture. Have students share their retellings with a partner or with the
class.


**Class Book: Our Own Tall Tale**

 - Have students create their own tall tale as a class. The tall tale may feature
the entire class as characters, or for ease of creation, may feature you, the
teacher, as the main character. Make sure that the tall tale features the
elements of humor and exaggeration, and that the main character is larger
than life. Also be sure to create an amazing childhood, amazing adventures
or feats, and a creation or invention. It is highly recommended that you set
your tall tale in the American frontier to reinforce what students have learned
in this unit about the American frontier.


**On Stage**

 - Have a group of students plan and then act out any one of the tall tales
covered in the tall tales portion of this unit. They may choose “Paul Bunyan,”
“Pecos Bill,” “John Henry,” or “Casey Jones.” Encourage students to use unitrelated vocabulary in their dialogue.


**Writing Prompts: Exaggerations**

 - Students may be given one of the following situations to expand into an
exaggeration:

“Pecos Bill,” “John Henry,” or “Casey Jones.” Encourage students to use unitrelated vocabulary in their dialogue.


**Paul Bunyan’s Colossal Flapjacks**

 - Plan a tall tale themed pancake breakfast for the class, complete with
“colossal” flapjacks, maple syrup, bacon, and blueberries. Tell students that
maple syrup and blueberries are both products from Maine, where Paul
Bunyan was originally from.


**Note:** Be sure to follow your school’s policy regarding food distribution and
allergies, along with applicable safety procedures.


Unit 1 Fairy Tales and Tall Tales


**Pecos Bill’s Cyclone in a Bottle**


Materials: two empty plastic soda bottles; water; tape

  - Fill one bottle three-fourths full with water. Tape the other bottle on top of
the one with water in it. Make sure that the spouts are lined up. Turn the
bottles over so the one with water is on top. Show how the water has a hard
time going down. To make the water go down into the other bottle, swirl the
bottles in a circular motion really fast. Don’t shake it up and down or it won’t
work. The water should swirl into the bottom bottle.


**How it works:** When you swirl the bottle, the water starts to move in a circle.
When the water moves fast enough, it pushes out against the bottle and
leaves a hole in the middle. There’s no water in the hole, only air. The hole
allows the air from the bottom bottle to come up to the top bottle. When
the air moves, there’s space in the bottom bottle, which makes room for the
water from the top to flow into the bottom.


**Note:** This sort of water movement, with the hole in the middle, is usually
called a whirlpool. A tornado, or cyclone, occurs in air and a whirlpool occurs
in water, but this experiment makes it possible to see the phenomenon.
