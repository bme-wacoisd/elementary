##### Introduction


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching the
_Fighting for a Cause_ unit. The Teacher Guide for _Fighting for a Cause_ contains fourteen daily lessons,
each of which is composed of two distinct parts, so that the lesson may be divided into smaller
chunks of time and presented at different intervals during the day. Each entire lesson will require a
total of sixty minutes.


This unit includes two Pausing Points following Lesson 6 and Lesson 12. At the end of the unit, a
total of four days, with one day each for Unit Review and Culminating Activities and two days for
the Unit Assessment, are included to allow time to review, reinforce, assess, and remediate content
knowledge. You should spend no more than twenty-one days total on this unit.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


At the back of this Teacher Guide, you will find a section titled “Teacher Resources.” In this section
you will find the following:


  - Free Verse Poetry Rubric


  - Activity Book Answer Key


  - Measures of Text Complexity


  - Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Correlation Chart


  - English Language Proficiency Standards Correlation Chart


~~**UNIT COMPONENTS**~~


Along with this Teacher Guide, you will need:


  - Flip Book for _Fighting for a Cause_


  - Image Cards for _Fighting for a Cause_


  - Activity Book for _Fighting for a Cause_


  - Digital Components for _Fighting for a Cause_


All unit components’ materials can also be found on the program’s online materials.


Introduction
**1**


~~**WHY FIGHTING FOR A CAUSE IS IMPORTANT**~~


This unit will introduce students to several ordinary people who stood up for what they believed
in and who fought for a cause, even when faced with immeasurable odds. They will learn about
some key figures who fought for various causes, such as religious freedom, the abolition of slavery,
and the equal protection of the law for all people. Each of these individuals were parts of broader
movements that helped change many laws in their respective countries. Students will understand
the connection between ideas and actions and how ordinary people can do extraordinary things.


The _Fighting for a Cause_ unit will introduce students to nine leaders:


    - Queen Esther


     - William Penn


     - William Wilberforce


     - Jackie Robinson


     - Rosa Parks


     - Martin Luther King Jr.


    - Cesar Chavez


     - Dolores Huerta


     - Dr. Héctor P. García


Students will learn about the dedication and sacrifice of these individuals, as well as the significant
impact they had on the fight for civil rights and human rights. This unit will also introduce students
to four young people who fought for a cause—Kelvin Doe, Mikaila Ulmer, Sydney Etzel, and Lauren
Anderson.


The texts that students will be reading and discussing in this unit provide opportunities to build
content knowledge and draw connections to social studies. You may build on class discussions to
support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of Citizenship, History, and
Social Studies Skills from the Social Studies TEKS. This content is not a replacement for grade-level
social studies instruction. For more information on religious source material in reading/language
arts, consult the program guide. For more information about the quantitative and qualitative
measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the
Teacher Resources.


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause
**2**


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED**~~


The following units, and the specific core content that was targeted in those units, are particularly
relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _Fighting for a Cause:_


**• America: Our Great Country (Kindergarten)**


**• American Independence (Grade 1)**


Introduction
**3**


~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR FIGHTING FOR A CAUSE**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _Fighting for a Cause_ in the forms in
which they appear in the Read-Alouds or, in some instances, in the “Introducing the Read-Aloud”
section at the beginning of the lesson. Bold-faced words in the list have an associated Word Work
activity. The inclusion of the words on this list does not mean that students are immediately
expected to be able to use all of these words on their own. However, through repeated exposure
throughout the lessons, they should acquire a good understanding of most of these words and begin
to use some of them in conversation.

**Show Image 1A-1: People asking to be heard**

Throughout history, many courageous

individuals have taken a stand for an

important cause. They have stood up for the

freedom to worship as their faith directs them,

for the freedom to live and work where they

choose, and for freedoms protected by **civil**

**rights** . ~~_Civil rights are rights granted by law to_~~

~~_ensure the freedoms we have are available to every citizen of our country. In_~~

~~_our country, the Declaration of Independence describes our unalienable rights_~~

~~_as coming from our Creator, and the Constitution provides the framework_~~

~~_for these rights granted by law._~~ Many people have had to fight hard to

secure these rights. There are many different ways to fight peacefully for a

cause. Some ways include giving speeches, writing books or poetry, talking

to leaders to convince them to change certain laws, providing business

opportunities, or refusing to buy certain things. These kinds of actions can all

be part of fighting for a cause.

Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


Over the next couple of weeks, you will hear eight stories from history about

people who took a stand for their beliefs. You will discover that most of these

people lived a long time ago. Even though the people you will read about used

nonviolence to “fight” for their causes, they often did so at great personal

risk. ~~_Great personal risk means that they showed bravery by standing up_~~

~~_for their cause, even when it meant putting themselves in harm’s way._~~ Even

though the stories come from a long time ago, what these people achieved

still impacts us today. They made it possible for us to have many of the

freedoms we have today.


**Show Image 1A-2: Religious freedom**

First, you will read about people who fought

for religious freedom. This is the freedom to

practice religion without the government telling

you how. You might remember from the _Land_

_of Opportunity_ unit that the right to freedom of

religion is guaranteed by the Bill of Rights in the

U.S. Constitution and that many immigrants

moved to the United States for this reason.


**Show Image 1A-3: Queen Esther**

You will read a story from the Bible about

Queen Esther, a Jewish woman who was

chosen by the king of Persia to be queen. An

advisor convinced the king to destroy the

Jews, but the king did not know this would

include his own queen. You will read about

what Queen Esther did to fight for her people.


**Show Image 1A-4: William Penn**

You will also read about a man named William

Penn who was sent to jail in England multiple

times because of his religion. He practiced

a different religion than the official Church

of England, and he was punished for having

different religious beliefs. William Penn

founded the colony of Pennsylvania, and he

made sure it was free from religious **discrimination** and a place where the

laws applied equally to all. ~~_Discrimination is unfair treatment of a person, or_~~

~~_group of people, because of their skin color, race, or religion._~~


**Show Image 1A-5: William Wilberforce**

Next, you will read about people who fought

for freedom to work and live by ending slavery.

You will hear the story of William Wilberforce,

a British politician born in 1759. He became a

devout Christian, and, because of his beliefs,

he became part of the abolitionist **movement** .

~~_A movement happens when a large group of_~~

~~_people come together to support a cause._~~ Wilberforce continued to work to

pass laws against slavery even after his own life was threatened because of

his beliefs.


**Show Image 1A-6: Civil rights**

You will read the stories of people who fought

for freedoms provided by civil rights under

the law. You’ll learn that throughout history,

in other countries, and in older times in our

country, some people had freedoms, but

others did not. People who fought for civil

rights worked to make sure that the laws and

freedoms available in our country were given to all U.S. citizens. Civil rights

in the United States include freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the right

to vote, and protection from **discrimination** . Today in the United States,

there cannot be a law that gives rights to only certain people. But long before

you were born, that was not the case. And many people fought to make our

country better.


**Show Image 1A-7: Jackie Robinson**

You’ll learn about Jackie Robinson, a great

baseball player who fought to ensure people

could not be discriminated against in

professional sports based on their skin color.


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


**Show Image 1A-8: Rosa Parks**

You’ll learn about Rosa Parks, a woman who

fought to ensure that people could not be

discriminated against because of their skin

color when using a bus or any other kind of

service. She helped organize the Montgomery

Bus Boycott, where people refused to pay to

ride the bus until the discrimination stopped.

This boycott helped grow the civil rights movement, which involved actions

taken by many people across the country that resulted in changes to ensure

that our country’s laws apply equally to everyone.


**Show Image 1A-9: Martin Luther King Jr.**

Martin Luther King Jr. is perhaps the most

famous leader of the civil rights movement.

He believed in bringing about change through

**nonviolence** . ~~_Nonviolence is a refusal to_~~

~~_take physical action against someone who is_~~

~~_treating people badly or unfairly._~~ Because of

King’s leadership, the Civil Rights Movement

forced change and helped create opportunities for many people who had

experienced discrimination.


**Show Image 1A-10: Cesar Chavez and**
**Dolores Huerta**

Others followed the model set by Martin

Luther King Jr. and worked to extend civil

rights even further. Cesar Chavez and Dolores

Huerta fought to ensure that laws provided

equal protection to farmworkers in California,

who were often of Hispanic origin.

Many of the people in the stories you will

hear had to fight to make sure that freedom was given to all, not just some.

Today, it’s easy for us to take these freedoms for granted. ~~_To take something_~~

~~_for granted means to not think about or appreciate something, but just to_~~

~~_assume you’ve always had it._~~ It’s important to recognize and remember

the achievements of the people before us so we understand what these

important people did for our nation and the world. The people you will learn

about had courage. ~~_What does courage mean?_~~ Sometimes these people

were bullied or threatened, but this did not stop them from doing what they

knew was right. As you hear these stories, think about how different life was

all those years ago when these people set out to make the world a better

continuing to work to improve our world.

people in this unit, beginning with the next lesson, where they will learn about
Queen Esther.


  - Explain that there are no rules about how to write free verse poems; free
verse poems do not have to rhyme, and there can be as many or as few
words on a line as the poet wishes.


  - Explain that free verse poems are simply made up of the words the poet
chooses to write. In addition, free verse poems can form shapes. Students
can accomplish this by placing a different number of words on each line so
that the outline of the poem forms a shape.


  - Explain that students first need to plan their poem by brainstorming ideas.


  - Model the brainstorming process that students will use when planning their
free verse poems by directing their attention to the Central Idea/Supporting
Evidence Web prepared earlier.

~~**TEKS 2.1.A**~~


~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED? (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that they learned in the _Land of Opportunity_ unit that many
people immigrated to America because they wanted religious freedom. In
some countries around the world, today and throughout history, people
can be punished if they practice a religion in a way that is not approved by
the government. In today’s story, you will hear about someone who wanted
to make sure her religious group was free to practice their religion without
being harmed by her country’s government.


  - Tell students that, in today’s story, there is a king. Ask students the following
questions to review what they have learned:


    - Who can remember some of the differences between kings and
presidents? _(Kings serve for life, and presidents serve for terms. A president_
_is elected to the position, and kings are not.)_


    - Who usually has more power, a king or a president? _(A king has more_
_power than a president.)_


  - Explain to students that today’s story is set in ancient Persia. Ask students
if they remember learning about ancient Persia. Remind students that,
earlier in the year, they learned in Unit 2: _Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and_
_Government_ that ancient Persia attacked Greece. Remind students that one
of the Persian kings they learned about was Xerxes. Explain that there were
several ancient kings that used the name Xerxes. They will also hear the
name Xerxes in today’s story. Some believe the Xerxes in today’s story is the
same Xerxes you learned about, but others do not.


  - Background for Teacher: The story of Esther was first written in Hebrew, and
is part of both the Hebrew and Christian Bibles. In various translations from
the original Hebrew, the name of the king is translated as Xerxes, Ahasuerus,
and Achashverosh. Some students may be familiar with the story of Esther,
and may know the king by those other names.


**TEKS 2.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and answer questions using multi-word responses.


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Explain to students that the story today comes from the Hebrew Bible, which
is also organized as the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. Members of the
Jewish and Christian religions believe that key stories of the Hebrew Bible tell
the history of the Jewish people.


  - Today’s story comes from a book of the Hebrew Bible and Christian Bible
entitled _Esther_, and it is the story of one person who had faith and performed
a brave deed that saved an entire group of people.


**Setting**

  - Show students the timeline on Digital Component 2.1. Use the timeline to
help students understand when this story took place. [Key events on the
timeline include the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the voyage
of the _Mayflower_, the Civil War, the Battle of Thermopylae, and the reign of
King Solomon.] Explain to students that this story took place around the
same time as the Battle of Thermopylae. [Esther is added to the timeline
later in the lesson.]


  - Using a world map or globe, help students locate the country of Iran. Tell
students that Persia and Iran are two names for the same country. Iran is the
official name, but Persia was used in history, and some of the people of Iran
today are referred to as Persians.


  - Display Image Card 1 that shows the Persian Empire. Explain to students that
the story they will listen to today is set in the city of Susa in ancient Persia.
While this is an ancient city, it still exists today in modern-day Iran. Have
students locate Susa on the map. Use a map of the world or globe to show
where Persia would be today and where the United States is located.

The story of Esther begins about two thousand

five hundred years ago, in the year 483 BC,

in the kingdom of Persia. The Persian Empire

was ruled by King Xerxes [/zerk*seez/]. At

the time, people living in Persia had diverse

religious beliefs and backgrounds. Jews were

one of these groups. Some of them settled in Persia after having been forced

to leave their homeland when it had been invaded and destroyed years

before. Persians and Jews had different customs. They dressed, spoke, and

worshiped differently. One of these Jewish people was a young, orphaned

girl named Esther. Esther lived in the Persian city of Susa with her cousin

Mordecai [/mord-duh-kai/], who raised her. ~~_How do you think Esther might_~~

**Show Image 2A-2: Esther**

When Esther was a young woman, King Xerxes

decided to find a wife to serve as his queen.

When he met Esther, he decided that she was

the one, so he married her and made her the

queen of the **empire** . ~~_An empire is the territory_~~

~~_or land under control of a ruler._~~ Now, Esther

had not revealed her identity, because Mordecai

had forbidden her to do so. The king did not know that Esther was Jewish.


Even after Esther was made queen, Mordecai still checked on her. “Every day

[Mordecai] walked back and forth near the courtyard . . . to find out how Esther was

and what was happening to her.” [1] ~~_Why would Mordecai want to stay near to Esther?_~~


**Show Image 2A-3: Mordecai standing near**
**the gate**

As time went by, Mordecai stayed near the

gate, the place where all the business of the

city was conducted. He would send messages

to Esther through the palace officials that were

Esther’s helpers. Those messages reminded

her to keep her beliefs a secret in order to

stay safe. Esther “continued to follow Mordecai’s instructions as she had

done when he was bringing her up.” [2] ~~_Why would Esther continue to follow_~~

~~_Mordecai’s instructions, even though she was no longer living with him?_~~


**Show Image 2A-4: Mordecai overhears the**
**plot**

One day, as Mordecai was sitting at the king’s

gate, two of the king’s officers became angry

with the king. They were so angry that they

made a plan to kill King Xerxes. Mordecai

overheard the **plot** . ~~_A plot means a plan to_~~

~~_cause trouble._~~ He told Queen Esther what he

had heard. Queen Esther reported this information to the king, giving Mordecai

the credit. The two officials were punished, and the king’s helper wrote the

story down in his official book of records. Queen Esther and Mordecai had

saved the king. ~~_What does it mean to give someone credit for something?_~~



1 Esther 2:11
2 Esther 2:20



Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


**Show Image 2A-5: Haman and King Xerxes**

Sometime after these events, King Xerxes gave

a man named Haman a very important position.

Haman had been given **authority**, ~~_or power to_~~

~~_make decisions_~~, to advise the king on important

things that impacted the entire country of Persia.

As a person of authority, the king commanded

everyone to bow down to Haman, and to bow with

special honor. Mordecai refused to bow with special honor. When Haman learned

that Mordecai refused to bow with special honor to him, he became so angry that

he wanted to destroy Mordecai and all of the other Jewish people.


**Show Image 2A-6: A special ring**

Haman used his position of authority with

the king to put his plan into action. He tried

to convince the king that because the Jews

in Persia followed different traditions from

other people in the kingdom, they should be

persecuted. He argued that they did not follow

the king’s rules. He asked the king to make a law that would destroy the Jewish

people. The king agreed to Haman’s plan. Xerxes gave Haman a special ring

that gave Haman the authority to pass laws.


**Show Image 2A-7: Haman casting lots**

Haman decided to cast lots to decide which

month should be the one in which he would

destroy the Jews. “Casting lots” is a way to

leave something to chance, somewhat like

rolling dice. In ancient Persia, some people

made decisions based on this trick. This led

Haman to the decision that the twelfth month

would be the one in which he would carry out his plan to harm the Jews.


Haman then passed a law that said that on a certain day in the twelfth

month, all of the Jewish people living in King Xerxes’s empire would be

attacked, and he posted the law throughout Persia. In every part of the

country, the Jewish people mourned, wept, and fasted. Fasting means

choosing to go without food for a period of time. Like other Jewish people,

when Mordecai heard this news, he became quite sad. He went into the city,

wailing and crying near the king’s gate.

**Show Image 2A-8: Mordecai shares his plan**

Esther had not yet heard the news of Haman’s

plan. When she learned about Mordecai’s sadness,

she sent a messenger to find out what was wrong.

She learned about the plan to hurt the Jewish

people. ~~_What would be the impact of Haman’s law_~~

~~_on Esther’s family, like her cousin Mordecai? Do_~~

~~_you think the law would apply to Esther?_~~ Mordecai

sent instructions to Esther to go to the king to plead for mercy for her people.

~~_To plead for mercy means to ask for a lesser punishment._~~ But this was no simple

request. In those days, the king of Persia had a strict law: anyone, including the

queen, who went to the king with a formal request without his invitation could be

put to death. ~~_How do you think Esther would feel about the idea of approaching the_~~

~~_king without permission?_~~ Esther did not immediately approach the king, instead

telling Mordecai of the risks. Mordecai sent another message to Esther. It said,

“Do not think that because you are in the king’s house you alone of all the Jews

will escape. For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews

will arise from another place, but you and your father’s family will **perish** . And who

knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?” [3]

~~_Deliverance means being rescued or set free. Perish means to cease to exist or_~~

~~_die. “For such a time as this” has become a common expression that means being_~~

~~_chosen for a special moment or event. What does Mordecai mean when he says_~~

~~_this to Esther?_~~

Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


**Show Image 2A-9: Esther fasting**

She sent a message back to Mordecai, asking

him to gather all of the Jews living in Susa,

the capital of the Persian empire, and they

would all fast for three days. ~~_In some religions,_~~

~~_fasting is done while praying to ask God for_~~

~~_help._~~ Esther said, “When this is done, I will go

to the king, even though it is against the law.

And if I perish, I perish.” [4] ~~_What does Esther mean when she says, “If I perish, I_~~

~~_perish?” What traits does Esther show here?_~~


**Show Image 2A-10: King Xerxes**

The story of Esther is not finished. In the next

lesson, you will learn about the outcome of

Esther’s dangerous decision to meet with King

Xerxes without an invitation and plead for

mercy on behalf of all the Jewish people living

in the Persian empire. ~~_What do you think will_~~

~~_happen in the next part of this story?_~~


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


**1. Inferential.** Why would Haman want to hurt all of the Jews because of
Mordecai‘s refusal to bow to him? _(Haman was too proud and wanted to be_
_seen as powerful; Haman did not like Jewish people and their customs.)_


**2. Literal.** What did the king have recorded into the history book? _(He recorded_
_that Mordecai had saved him from the two men who plotted against him.)_


**3. Literal.** What did Mordecai do when he heard that the Jewish people were to
be hurt? _(He went into the city, wailing and crying near the king’s gate.)_


**4. Inferential.** Why would the Jewish people fast? _(Fasting was part of their_
_religion. It showed their faithfulness to God.)_


**5. Inferential.** Why would Mordecai advise Esther to keep her Jewish heritage a
secret from the king? _(The Jewish people were not accepted by the kingdom;_
_Mordecai was unsure how the king would react when he found out that Esther_
_was Jewish.)_

**Lesson 3: Esther Part 2: Guardian of Her People**
##### Introducing the Read-Aloud


**Speaking and Listening:** Students will review what they have learned about
Esther and the character traits she showed in standing up for her people.


~~**TEKS 2.1.A**~~


~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED? (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that they have learned that in history, many people have
been interested in religious freedom, or the ability to practice religion without
the government telling you how. Ask them to recollect yesterday’s lesson
when they started to read a story about Esther, who wanted to make sure
the Jewish people remained free without being attacked by their government
and neighbors.


  - Have students recall what they learned in the previous lesson. Remind
students that this is a story from the Bible. Use the following questions to
prompt discussion:


    - Who was Esther? _(Esther was an orphaned Jewish girl living a long time ago_
_in the country of Persia. She was raised by her cousin Mordecai, but she hid_
_her Jewish identity.)_


    - Who was King Xerxes? _(Xerxes was the king of Persia, who chose Esther to_
_be his wife.)_


    - What good deed did Mordecai do to help the King? _(At one point, Mordecai_
_discovered a plot to kill King Xerxes and reported it to the queen, who_
_stopped the plot. Mordecai’s good deed was recorded in the king’s official_
_book of records.)_


    - Who was Haman? _(A man in a position of power in the court. While Xerxes_
_was king, he promoted Haman to a position where Haman could make laws_
_for the entire country, and Haman expected people to bow to him.)_


    - How did Mordecai make Haman angry? _(He refused to bow with special_
_honor to Haman.)_


    - What did Haman do about this? _(Angry at this, Haman created a law to_
_have all the Jewish people in Persia destroyed. He cast lots to determine_
_when it would be—the twelfth month.)_


**TEKS 2.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and answer questions using multi-word responses.

 - Mordecai was worried about the new law, so he spoke to Esther. What did he
want Esther to do? _(Mordecai asked Esther to speak to the king to try to stop_
_Haman’s plan from happening.)_


 - What would happen to Esther, or anyone, who went to the King with a request
without an invitation? _(If Esther or anyone else went to the king without an_
_invitation, the laws of ancient Persia meant that Esther could be put to death,_
_unless the king spared her life.)_


 - What character traits describe Esther in the story from the previous lesson?
_(kind, obedient, faithful, brave)_


~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION OR TERMS (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain to students that, in today’s story, they will learn more about Esther’s
choice. She could choose to continue hiding her identity from the king,
hoping she would be spared from the destruction that Haman had planned,
or she could take a risk and reveal her true identity to the king. But she would
be risking her own death.


 - Students will also learn how the Jewish holiday of Purim began.


 - Explain that today’s story will tell of an attempt to kill all Jewish people.
Unfortunately, that has happened more than once in history.


 - Remind students that in the kindergarten Kings and Queens unit, they
learned about a king named Solomon. The story of King Solomon is also a
story from the Bible. What was King Solomon most remembered for? _(King_
_Solomon is most remembered for his wisdom.)_


 - Explain that wisdom is a trait of King Solomon. ~~_A trait is a characteristic that_~~
~~_someone has or possesses._~~ Explain to students that some traits exist outside
of their control. In the same way that they cannot control the outcome of
rolling the dice, they cannot control their eye color or their height. Other
traits, though, are characteristics that they can develop in themselves. For
instance, they can choose to be honest, kind, brave, or faithful.

**Turn and Talk:** When we left off yesterday, Esther was forced to
make a choice. She could either go to the king and ask him to
stop Haman from hurting all of the Jews, or she could keep hiding
her identity and remain silent in order to protect herself, knowing
that all of the Jewish people would be hurt. But if she went to
the king to ask for help, she could be put to death. What do you
think Esther will choose to do? What emotions might she feel?
_(Answers may vary but students may express that Esther probably_
_felt afraid.)_

Esther and all the Jews living in Susa fasted

for three days. After three days, Esther put

permission. ~~_How do you think King Xerxes will_~~

because he thought that the king was honoring him. He bragged to his

friends and family about receiving the invitation, his wealth, and how he was

the only person Queen Esther had invited to join her and the king. That same

day, Haman saw Mordecai again on the street. Again, Haman’s heart filled

with rage against Mordecai and the Jewish people, but he remained focused

on the upcoming dinner. ~~_Do you think Haman realized that Queen Esther was_~~

events that had happened during his **reign**,

about Mordecai’s actions that saved him from death. ~~_Do you remember what_~~

for his actions. When he found out that Mordecai had not been rewarded, he

instructed Haman to collect a royal robe and a horse and to **parade** Mordecai

was angry but did as the king said. As Mordecai was paraded through the

streets, Haman proclaimed, “This is what is done for the man the king

delights to honor!” [2] This meant that people who the king liked would be

rewarded. ~~_How do you think Haman feels about having to honor Mordecai?_~~

**Show Image 3A-4: Angry King Xerxes**

The day of the dinner arrived. As the three sat

and ate, King Xerxes asked Esther again, “What

is your petition? It will be given you. What is

your request? Even up to half the kingdom,

it will be granted.” [3] Esther answered the king

by saying, “If I have found favor with you, Your

Majesty, and if it pleases you, grant me my

life—this is my petition. And spare my people—this is my request. For I and

my people have been sold to be destroyed, killed and annihilated.” [4] ~~_Annihilate_~~

~~_means to destroy something._~~ King Xerxes became angry and asked, “Who is

he? Where is he—the man who has dared to do such a thing?” [5] ~~_Who is Queen_~~

~~_Esther referring to?_~~


**Show Image 3A-5: King Xerxes gives**
**Mordecai the ring**

Queen Esther turned, pointed at Haman, and

called him an evil man. Haman stood, terrified,

before the king and queen. The king decided

what would happen to Haman and punished

him by having him put to death. When the king

learned that Mordecai was related to Esther,

and given all that Mordecai had done for the king, Xerxes took the special

ring that had belonged to Haman and presented it to Mordecai. This made

Mordecai one of the king’s most trusted **advisors**, and he could now pass

laws like Haman did before. ~~_Advisors are people who help by giving advice._~~

Mordecai was also given all of Haman’s property and wealth. ~~_How do you_~~

~~_able to stop Haman’s order to attack the Jewish people?_~~


**Show Image 3A-6 Purim**

However, the order to attack the Jewish people

throughout the Persian Empire still stood.

According to Persian law, once an order was

stamped with the king’s ring, the rule was final.

Not even King Xerxes could undo it. The only

way to take back or undo the law was to create

a new one. Therefore, King Xerxes allowed Mordecai to issue a new law,

signed with the special ring, to warn all the Jews in the kingdom of Haman’s

wicked plan so that they could protect themselves from harm.

Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause



**46**


When the day came for Haman’s original law to be implemented, when the

Jewish people living in Persia were to be attacked and destroyed, Haman’s

plan ultimately failed. Instead of being destroyed, the Jewish people banded

together and defended themselves against those who wanted to harm

them. “Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews

throughout the [nation] of King Xerxes, near and far, to have them celebrate

annually . . . [during the twelfth month of the Hebrew calendar] as the time

when the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month when their

sorrow was turned into joy and their **mourning**, ~~_or deep sadness_~~, into a day

of celebration. [6] ” ~~_Remember when Haman had cast lots to decide when he_~~

~~_would carry out his plan? What number had been determined when Haman_~~

~~_had cast lots before? What was that game of chance called?_~~ These days of

celebration for the Jewish people were called **Purim**, based on the same

game of chance played by Haman. This day became a celebration to give

thanks to God, who had demonstrated that he, not chance, determined what

would happen to the Jewish people.


**Show Image 3A-7: Remembering Esther’s**
**bravery**

The Jewish people living in Persia decided

to “establish the **custom** that they and their

**descendants** and all who join them should

without fail observe these two days every year

. . . in every generation by every family, and …

in every city.” [7] ~~_A custom is a well-known way_~~

~~_of doing things according to society. Descendants are people who came from_~~

~~_someone else._~~ They wanted to make sure that the memory of these days

of **Purim** would “never fail to be celebrated by the Jews—nor should the

memory of these days die out among their descendants. [8] ” ~~_Purim is a Jewish_~~

~~_celebration that involves giving gifts of food to friends, giving charity to the_~~

~~_poor, and eating a meal. Why do you think Purim is such an important holiday_~~

~~_to Jewish people?_~~


Because of Mordecai and Esther’s willingness to stand up for their people

and their beliefs, they were able to save the Jewish people living in Persia.

They fought for what they knew was right and made a difference that not

only affected the Jews of Persia but also Jewish people today.

  - Ask students to describe how Queen Esther showed bravery. _(She revealed_
_that she was Jewish, even though it meant that she could be killed, so that the_

_(Answers may vary but could include to stand up for what you believe in, to be_
_brave in the face of danger, and to do the right thing even if it is scary._


  - Explain to students that the story we heard about Esther is set in ancient
Persia, a long time ago. Point to the timeline, and point to a map/globe for the
location of Iran where Persia was located. Explain where we live today, in the
United States. Point to the timeline, and point to a map/globe for the location

 - Point to a map/globe, and show the location of England. Tell students that
today they will hear the story of a person who fought for religious freedom
in England. Remind students that in Lesson 1, they learned that the people
in this unit fought in nonviolent ways. The person they will learn about today
behaved in a way consistent with his faith, which stressed being peaceful and
nonviolent. He suffered consequences for his beliefs, though—he was even
put in jail. But because he fought for freedom many years ago in England,
we have religious freedom today in the United States. This man’s name was
William Penn.


**Show Image 4A-1: William Penn**

 - Tell students that today in the United States, people are free to practice
their religion without the risk that they will be punished by the government.
In ancient Persia, they did not have that kind of religious freedom because
Jewish people were almost attacked because of their religion. But in our
country, we have religious freedom.


 - Explain that one of the reasons people have religious freedom in the United
States today is because when our country was founded, it was founded
by many people who wanted religious freedom. Many people left England
because, in England, they did not have religious freedom. They could be
punished if they didn’t practice religion the way the government of England
required. Many of these early founders of our country wanted to make sure
that here in America, everyone had the freedom to worship as they believed
without the government telling us how.

~~**“WILLIAM PENN: A FRIEND OF PEACE” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 4A-1: William Penn**

The state of Pennsylvania was named after an

Englishman called William Penn who lived over

350 years ago. Penn believed that countries

should not have laws that dictate how people

worship. He was a believer in religious

freedom, ~~_which is the right to practice religion_~~

~~_without the government telling you how_~~ . He

was also devoted to the idea that people should be free to express their

opinions without being put in jail.


Penn was born in the busy city of London, England, in 1644. His father was Sir

William Penn, an important leader in the English navy. Penn grew up in a very

difficult time when there was a lot of debate in England about who should

lead the country, a king or representatives elected by the English people.

At this time, the country of England followed the teachings of the Church of

England.

Check for Understanding


Why was it a difficult time in England when Penn lived there?
_(Answers may vary but may include that at that time, England was_
_having a lot of debate about who should lead the country and the_
_country followed the teachings of the Church of England.)_


**Show Image 4A-2: Puritans**

During this time, some people suffered because

they were treated differently due to their

religious beliefs. Groups like the Puritans often

faced discrimination. The **Puritans** were a group

of people who wanted to “purify” or change the

Church of England. They preferred simpler ways

of worshiping over what they considered to be

extravagant ceremonies. They wanted to practice religion in their own way using

the Christian Bible as a guide. But because they worshiped differently than the

official Church of England, many other people didn’t trust them.


**Show Image 4A-3: Quakers**

In those days, if you didn’t follow the Church

of England, you could get into big trouble.

You could be fined or put in jail. The Puritans

weren’t the only ones being treated this way.

Another Christian religious group called the

**Quakers** also faced tough times. Just like

the Puritans, the Quakers wanted to worship

in their own way without anyone telling them they were wrong. When

William Penn was a young student, he started to learn about the beliefs of

the Quakers. They did not follow the Church of England’s requirements for

worship such as using the Book of Common Prayer to guide services and

ceremonies. They believed that everyone was equal in the eyes of God, and

that fighting with violence wasn’t right. Because their ideas were different

from the Church of England, they sometimes got into trouble. The English

government even made rules against them. At times, it was illegal for

Quakers to be public officials or meet together to worship. When they broke

these rules, they had to pay fines or even go to jail.

_extravagant_ means over

**58**



**Show Image 4A-4: Penn and the Quakers**

As William Penn learned more about the

Quakers, he felt a strong connection to their

Christian beliefs. Penn decided to become one

of them. Remember those rules against the

Quakers? Penn didn’t think those rules were

fair, and he wasn’t afraid to say so. He did not

fight with violence. His way of fighting for his beliefs was to speak publicly

about them. But standing up for what he believed wasn’t always easy. It

came with consequences. There were times when he was put in jail for

attending Quaker meetings or for speaking out against the unfair treatment

of Quakers. While Penn was in jail, he used his time to write about his beliefs.

He wrote a book called _No Cross, No Crown_ in 1668 from a jail cell in the

Tower of London. He was put there because he wouldn’t give up his Quaker

beliefs and spoke out for the freedom to choose any religion.


**Show Image 4A-5: The Church of England**

In 1670, the government of King Charles II in

England made a new rule. The new rule said

that no more than five people could meet

together unless they were worshiping in the

Church of England. This was a way to stop

groups like the Quakers. William Penn decided

to preach to crowds in the streets anyway. This

got him into trouble, and he was taken to court. When he was in court, he did

something surprising: he refused to take off his hat in front of the judge. To

him, this was a way of saying everyone was equal. The **jury**, ~~_a group of people_~~

~~_deciding if he was innocent or guilty_~~, agreed with Penn. They believed he had

the right to believe and speak what he wished and be treated with kindness.

And soon, Penn would get a chance to create a place where that dream could

come true.


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


**Show Image 4A-6: A new place called**
**Pennsylvania**

In 1681, King Charles II gave William Penn a

large piece of land. ~~_Why would the king give_~~

~~_Penn valuable land?_~~ It turns out that the king

owed Penn’s father a big favor, and instead

of paying him back with money, the king gave

Penn land in North America. Penn saw this as a perfect chance to make a

special place for Quakers and anyone else who was treated unfairly because

of their beliefs. The new colony was named Pennsylvania in memory of

Penn’s father.


**Show Image 4A-7: From England to**
**Pennsylvania**

William Penn wanted his colony in North

America to provide basic freedoms. A **colony**

is a region or place ruled and controlled by a

faraway country. Penn wrote those freedoms

into the rules for his colony. Those rules were

Pennsylvania’s Frame of Government, which was written in 1682. It said

people in Pennsylvania had the freedom to worship God how they wanted,

without fear of being put in jail. It said that everyone would get a fair trial if

they got into trouble. And it said that people could vote for who they wanted

to represent them. Soon, many Quakers had crossed the Atlantic Ocean to

make a home in Pennsylvania. ~~_[On the map of England to Pennsylvania, point_~~

~~_out that England is where William Penn grew up and Pennsylvania is where he_~~

~~_moved too.]_~~ They weren’t the only ones, either. Many people decided they

liked the sound of William Penn’s promises. The Quakers strongly believed

that all people are equal in the eyes of God. They thought men and women

should be treated the same by the laws. They also believed in sharing the

land with the Native American tribes. These beliefs became part of the laws

of Pennsylvania.


**Show Image 4A-8: Life in Pennsylvania**

William Penn met with the Lenape and offered

to make a **treaty**, ~~_or agreement_~~, with them.

He treated them as equals and promised to

respect their lands. Penn believed in learning

from the Native Americans. They taught the

settlers about the land, how to grow crops,

and how to survive the cold winters. In return, the settlers shared their own

knowledge and tools with the Native Americans. William Penn had a big

dream for Pennsylvania. He wanted it to be a special place where people

could live happily and be treated fairly, no matter what they believed. He

wanted a place where kindness, fairness, and respect ruled. Penn didn’t

keep this dream to himself. He wrote about it and made speeches about

it. Penn’s ideas inspired other Founding Fathers such as Thomas Jefferson

and Benjamin Franklin. Jefferson once said that Penn was the “greatest

lawgiver the world has produced.” Word quickly spread. People from different

places with different beliefs and different dreams all started to come to

Pennsylvania. This made Pennsylvania a very **diverse** place. This means

that there were people from different backgrounds and cultures all living

together. They learned from each other. They shared food, stories, traditions,

and the dream that William Penn had started.


Check for Understanding


In Unit 9, _Land of Opportunity_, you learned about how the United
States is very diverse. What was the United States referred to in
that lesson? _(A melting pot)_ How is the colony of Pennsylvania like a
“melting pot”? _(Answers may vary but could include that there were_
_many different people with different beliefs living there.)_


**Show Image 4A-9: A legacy that lives on**

The ideas that William Penn brought to

Pennsylvania didn’t stay there. They spread

to other colonies. Eventually, Penn’s ideas

helped shape the whole country. Pennsylvania

became an example of what was possible

when people were given religious freedom and

were governed by laws based on the idea that

all people were created equal in the eyes of God.


Even today, we can see William Penn’s dream alive in our country. The idea

that we should all be free to believe what we want and live in peace is still

something we strive for. William Penn had to fight for religious freedom

during his lifetime. We have religious freedom today because he did.

**Show Image 5A-1: New ideas**

In 1776, the United States of America became

a country of its own. Before then, people living

in the colonies had been part of the British

Empire, under the rule of the British king.

The colonists wanted to be free to make their

own decisions. One of the Founding Fathers,

a man named Thomas Jefferson, wrote that “all men are created equal.”

~~_[Sometimes, the word men means all people, including both women and_~~

~~_men.]_~~ America’s founders thought people were equal in the eyes of God. The

Founding Fathers thought Americans should be free and should have the

chance to find happiness by pursuing their own dreams without government

interference.


But Jefferson’s words represented very new ideas in human history. In most

countries at the time, people did not have many freedoms. As we read before,

people in England did not have the religious freedom to worship unless they

worshiped exactly as the government required. And that was not the only

way people were not free. Throughout the British Empire at the time, in

England and its colonies, there were people who did not have even the basic

freedom to make choices of how to live or work—they were enslaved.

Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


**Show Image 5A-2: Age of Enlightenment**

The Founding Fathers were influenced by many

great thinkers from around the world. New

ideas were popping up everywhere in these

times. Historians call this period the **Age of**

**Enlightenment** . ~~_[The Age of Enlightenment_~~

~~_refers to a time in history when people made a_~~

~~_lot of advancements in science, art, and government. It was said that theworld_~~

~~_was lighting up with new ideas and knowledge.]_~~ Some of those new ideas were

about how people should be treated. Enlightenment Age thinkers combined

old religious ideas with new ideas about law, concluding that if we truly were all

equal in the eyes of God, then the laws of a nation should treat people equally.

This seems normal to us today, but it was a very new idea 300 years ago.


**Show Image 5A-3: London, England**

One of the topics they began to consider

was slavery. Enslaved people were owned by

another person and did not have freedom

to make choices about how they worked or

lived. The idea of slavery is the opposite of

freedom. Today, we know slavery is wrong.

People should be free. But in the times of the American colonies, slavery

was considered by many to be normal. Slavery had existed in one form or

another for thousands of years. But the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment

began to have an effect, especially on America’s Founding Fathers and on

some of those in England that influenced them, like William Penn. ~~_What do_~~

~~_you remember about William Penn? What cause did he fight for?_~~ The founding

of America as a country began the process of ending slavery in the United

States. And around the same time as the Declaration of Independence, some

of the first big strides to end slavery throughout the British Empire also

began in the city of London in England. ~~_[Point to London on a map.]_~~


**Show Image 5A-4: Markets**

Imagine walking through the streets of

London in 1776. You would see busy markets

filled with colorful **stalls** . ~~_Stalls are where_~~

~~_people sell things in a market._~~ You would hear

people **haggling**, ~~_or discussing the prices of_~~

**72**



Everywhere you looked, there would be movement and energy. Business was

thriving because of a new idea that changed how people lived and worked. It

was called industrialism. During this time, new machines were invented that

made a whole lot of things easier to produce. Factories for these machines

started being built everywhere. One big industry in Great Britain was

**textiles**, ~~_or cloth and fabric_~~ .


A fourth of all the people in Great Britain were involved in working with

cotton in one way or another! Of all the cotton cloth made in England, the

British Empire exported half of it to other countries. The textile business

grew rapidly, and, thanks to industrial factories, prices kept getting lower so

more people could afford quality clothing. All of this business depended on

growing a lot of cotton. Back then, cotton was largely grown and picked by

enslaved people in places like North and South America.


**Show Image 5A-5: Sugar cane**

Besides textiles, or clothes, another major

industry in the British Empire back then

was sugar. Factories popped up throughout

England that would receive sugar cane, a type

of plant, and process it into various sugar

products like the kind of sugar we can buy

today. People loved to eat sugar, and the price of sugar steadily dropped

as industrial factories expanded. The source of the sugar eaten throughout

much of the world was sugar cane grown in many different parts of the

Americas, mostly in the Caribbean islands. And, back then, it was grown

mostly by people who were enslaved.


**Show Image 5A-6: Quakers**

The British Empire included many colonies

around the world where plantations, or large

farms, grew cotton or sugar cane with the

labor of enslaved people. Slavery was all too

common throughout the world. But as the

years went on, a few people in America and

England began to talk about doing away with slavery. They questioned how

one person could ever own another. It just didn’t seem right. They believed

that every person deserves freedom and respect. These people became

**abolitionist movement** . Among the earliest abolitionists were the Quakers.

The Quakers have a long history, in both Great Britain and the United States,


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


of standing up for the idea that people are equal in the eyes of God. Quakers

are **pacifists**, or ~~_people who do not believe in violence. Do you remember_~~

~~_the person we learned about in this unit who was a Quaker?_~~ They held to the

biblical teaching from Romans 12:17–18 that says, “Do not repay anyone evil

for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. If it is possible,

as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.”


**Show Image 5A-7: Olaudah Equiano**

In the early years of the abolition movement,

a group of remarkable people emerged who

were determined to make a difference. One

of these was someone who had actually been

enslaved: Olaudah Equiano [/oo*lah*oo*dah

               - eh*kwaa*now/]. Born in Africa, he was

kidnapped as a child and sold into slavery in the British Empire. After many

tough years, he managed to buy his own freedom. He traveled to Great

Britain and, using his experiences, wrote _The Interesting Narrative of the Life_

_of Olaudah Equiano_ . This book described his life’s journey and the unfairness

of slavery. His book described his own Christian faith, and he asked how

people who followed the Golden Rule could possibly support slavery. As his

story spread, it opened many eyes to just how wrong slavery was.


**Show Image 5A-8: Phillis Wheatley**

Another former enslaved person had her own

story to tell. Once a young girl in West Africa,

Phillis Wheatley was taken from her home and

brought to Boston as an enslaved person. The

young Phillis discovered a talent for words.

She wrote beautiful poems. She was a woman

of strong Christian faith, and many of her writings spoke to the need of

God’s people to be free, including those who were then enslaved. Her poetry

achieved fame throughout America and England, and were an influence on

many of the Founding Fathers who advocated for the abolition of slavery.

**Show Image 5A-9: Granville Sharp**

Granville Sharp was an English biblical scholar

who believed in using the law to protect those

in need. One day, he met a young enslaved

man in England named Jonathan Strong who

had been treated badly. Sharp decided to help,

and he argued in court that the man should be

free. A few years later, Sharp supported James Somerset, another enslaved

person in Britain. Somerset’s slaveholder wanted to sell him to a plantation

in Jamaica. Somerset had abolitionist friends like Granville Sharp, who

argued that this should not be allowed. This case was important because it

was the first time that a judge said that keeping someone enslaved should

not be allowed in England. The case did not end slavery in the British Empire,

but it was a major step forward.


Check for Understanding


How do you think abolitionists felt after the English judge ruled
that keeping someone enslaved should not be allowed in England?
_(Answers may vary but may include thrilled, excited, like their hard_
_work was paying off)_


**Show Image 5A-10: Thomas Clarkson**

Another early British abolitionist was a friend

of Sharp named Thomas Clarkson. Clarkson

was always on the move. He traveled all

over England, talking to sailors and others,

gathering stories about the unfairness of

slavery. Clarkson was determined to show

everyone how bad slavery was. With each story, he helped the world see why

slavery needed to end.


These individuals were not the only ones making a difference. A group

in England called the Society for the Purpose of Effecting the Abolition

of the Slave Trade was formed in 1787. Led by twelve dedicated Christian

abolitionists, including Sharp and Clarkson, the group gathered stories

about the slave trade. They turned these stories into flyers and articles that


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


reached people all over the country. Their mission was clear: gather support

to end slavery in Great Britain. Together, these abolitionists painted a picture

of a world where everyone had the right to be free.


**Show Image 5A-11: Taking a stand**

Not everyone believed what the abolitionists

did. Many abolitionists faced criticism and

even anger from others. Some shopkeepers

who supported abolition lost customers.

Artists who made paintings or drawings about

freedom faced criticism. Speakers who voiced

their ideas were sometimes met with loud boos instead of applause. And

some were attacked. ~~_Think about how hard it would be if you stood up for_~~

~~_something you believed in, and people got angry. How would that make you_~~

~~_feel?_~~


Despite all these challenges, abolitionists didn’t back down. They knew they

were standing up for what was right. These early abolitionists would light the

way to ending the slave trade. ~~_What does the phrase “light the way” mean?_~~

It was just the beginning of a longer journey. Their work reminds us all of an

important lesson. When you truly believe in something, even when it’s hard,

you should speak up for what is right, even if you might face consequences.

**Show Image 6A-1: William Wilberforce**

Over three hundred years ago, many things

were different from today. Things we take

for granted today, like running water, air

conditioning, or electric lights, just didn’t

exist yet. ~~_What does “take for granted” mean?_~~

People worked differently, played differently,

and lived differently. One thing that was legal

then that is not now was slavery. Slavery was when people were owned by

other people and did not have freedom to make choices about how they

worked or lived. But there were people who wanted to change how others

thought about slavery. One of them was an English man named William

Wilberforce. He believed that treating people as property was immoral, ~~_or_~~

~~_wrong_~~ ~~.~~ He also believed no one should be enslaved. He played a large role in

abolishing slavery in his country. This is his story.

**Show Image 6A-2: His early life**

Wilberforce was born in England in 1759. His

family was wealthy. They made their money

in the sea trade. This means they used ships

to buy and sell goods from distant places.

When Wilberforce was young, he went to live

with his aunt and uncle. His aunt and uncle

were devout Christians. This meant they

placed great importance on the Bible and its

teachings. It also meant their beliefs played

a large part in their daily decisions and actions. ~~_Who else have you learned_~~

~~_about whose faith was very important to them?_~~ Growing up with them,

Wilberforce began to believe this way too. His faith would guide many of the

big choices he made throughout his life.


**Show Image 6A-3: Education**

Wilberforce attended the University of

Cambridge. He soon met another student

named William Pitt, and they quickly became

close friends. They loved talking about how

to solve the problems they saw around them.

Both young men were determined to make

the world a better place. Pitt would become

the Prime Minister of England, a very important figure who reported directly

to the King of England. Pitt encouraged Wilberforce to become a Member of

Parliament. This meant Wilberforce would be one of many people who helped

run the government in England. He would have a say in what laws were made.


**Show Image 6A-4: A Moral Leader**

In Parliament, Wilberforce became famous for

his speeches. People listened closely when he

spoke because he was so enthusiastic about

helping others. His strong faith played a big

part in this. He believed in doing what was

**moral**, ~~_or what was right and fair_~~ . For example,

he thought it was important that workers get

a day to rest each week and pushed for a law where everyone would have

Sundays off. He also didn’t like it when animals were treated badly. This led

him to help start a group to protect animals called The Royal Society for the

Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), which still exists today.


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


**Show Image 6A-5: Devoted to ending slavery**

Wilberforce made a friend named John

Newton. Newton used to be a captain of a

ship that carried enslaved people from Africa.

But eventually, he gave up his job as a ship

captain and became a devout Christian like

Wilberforce. Newton shared many stories

with Wilberforce about his time as a slave ship

captain. These stories shocked Wilberforce with the harsh realities of slavery.

These stories made Wilberforce even more sure that slavery was wrong.

Newton also wrote a famous song called “Amazing Grace,” which talked about

his own life and how he had changed. It described how he stopped living an

immoral life and began living a moral one. ~~_Have you ever heard that song?_~~


**Show Image 6A-6: Slavery in the British**
**Empire**

In the late 1700s, Wilberforce’s country of

England played a big part in the slave trade.

This meant they used ships to take people

from Africa to be enslaved in far-off places.

From the years 1700 to 1807, Britain enslaved

about 3.1 million Africans. Big cities in Britain

like Bristol, Liverpool, and Glasgow were the home ports for ships that

transported the enslaved people. The people who owned these ships made a

lot of money.


One day, Wilberforce realized just how strongly he felt about his beliefs. He

wondered if he should stop being a leader in Parliament. Slavery was still

legal in England, and he knew that many members of Parliament felt that it

should remain that way. But his friends told him that he could do the most

good by using his leadership skills to help others. He soon made up his mind.

He decided that he would use his position in Parliament to end slavery. He

said, “My business is in the world, and I must mix in the assemblies of men or

quit the post which Providence seems to have assigned me.” ~~_This was his way_~~

~~_of saying he needed to be where he could help make positive changes._~~



Support


Remind students that in
Lesson 5, they learned the
definition of _immoral_ . Tell
students that _immoral_ and
_moral_ are antonyms, or
words that have opposite
meanings. Have students
discuss the difference
between the two.


Challenge


Play a version of “Amazing
Grace” for students and
have them compare it to
the “Battle Hymn of the
Republic” that they heard
during the earlier unit on
the Civil War.


Support


Tell students that a port is
a place where ships dock
to load or unload items.



Lesson 6 Wilberforce: English Abolitionist
**87**


**88**



**Show Image 6A-7: Wilberforce’s long road to**
**abolition**

In 1791, Wilberforce tried to pass a law in

Parliament that would end the slave trade,

but it didn’t work. Why not? Many people in

England made a lot of money from the slave

trade. They didn’t want it to stop because

they would lose money. Those people were

not happy with Wilberforce for wanting to end the slave trade. They insulted

him and even threatened to hurt him. Some of the leaders who used to be his

friends didn’t talk to him anymore. But he didn’t give up. He knew he had to

keep trying. He knew that his opinions would make him unpopular. He would

never be as powerful or wealthy as others. Wilberforce knew these things, but

he chose to work on making life better for others.


Over time, more people in England began to agree with Wilberforce. They

listened to the stories of people who had once been enslaved. One man

named Olaudah Equiano [/ow*laa*duh eh*kwaa*now/], ~~_whom you learned_~~

~~_about in the previous lesson_~~, wrote a book about the terrible things he went

through as an enslaved person. These stories made many people very sad

and angry. The desire to abolish slavery spread all throughout England. ~~_What_~~

~~_does it mean to abolish something?_~~


**Show Image 6A-8: Wilberforce’s legacy**

In 1807, a law called the Slave Trade Act was

passed. This law said people in England could

not buy or sell enslaved people anymore, but it

didn’t say they could not own enslaved people.

Wilberforce knew there was more work to do.

He had spoken out against the bad treatment

of enslaved people for many, many years.

In 1833, after working very hard for a long time, Wilberforce helped pass a

new law. This law was the Slavery Abolition Act. ~~_What does abolition mean?_~~

At last, it was against the law to buy, sell, or own an enslaved person in the

British Empire. Because of this law, about 800,000 enslaved people were

set free. By 1838, slavery was completely gone from Britain. The powerful

British navy helped to enforce the law. The big naval ships stopped over

1,600 ships that were carrying enslaved people despite the law. Before long,

people in other countries saw what Wilberforce and his friends had done.


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


They believed they could stop slavery in their countries too. In this way,

Wilberforce was inspiring the world!


The elimination of slavery in the British Empire was a major change in

human history. However, slavery was still practiced in most other nations

of the world at that time. Many abolitionists in the United States shared

Wilberforce’s faith and commitment to abolition. In the United States, the

Civil War was ultimately fought to end slavery. In the years that followed,

slavery began to be outlawed in more countries around the world. But it all

started with William Wilberforce. Because of him, many learned that one

person with strong faith can make a big difference.


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


**1. Literal.** What group was William Wilberforce a member of that allowed him to
help run the government in England and have a say in what laws were made?

  - Ask students riddles such as the following to review core content:


    - I became a member of Parliament, and I worked tirelessly to pass a law
that would end slavery in the British Empire. _(William Wilberforce)_


    - I was Queen of Persia. I risked my life to save the Jewish people living in
Persia. _(Queen Esther)_


    - I was a Quaker. Religious freedom was my fight, and I founded the colony
of Pennsylvania on the principle of religious freedom for all. _(William Penn)_


**Class Book: Fighting for a Cause**


Materials: Drawing paper, drawing tools

  - Tell the class or a group of students that they are going to make a class book
to help them remember what they have learned thus far in this unit.


  - Have students brainstorm important information about fighting for a cause
and about the people they learned about who fought for the rights of others
(e.g., Queen Esther, William Penn, and William Wilberforce).


  - Have each student choose one idea to draw a picture of, and ask them to
write a caption for the picture.


  - Bind the pages to make a book to put in the class library for students to read
again and again. You may choose to add more pages upon completion of the
entire unit before binding the book.

**Writing Prompts**

 - Students may be given an additional writing prompt such as the following:


   - If I became a member of my country’s government, like William Wilberforce,
I would promote . . .


   - People choose to fight for a cause because . . .


   - Religious freedom and freedom from slavery are both important because. . .


**Image Card Review**

 - Help students identify all of the individuals on the Image Cards used for the
Fighting for a Cause Timeline, and have them share what has been learned
about each person.


 - Then pass out all of the Image Cards to various students.


 - Have students share with a partner at least one cause the individual fought
for and a fact from their life. For example, for the Image Card of William
Penn, a student might say, “William Penn believed that everyone should be
free to practice their religion how they wanted without interference from the
government.”


**Perspectives**

 - Remind students that all of the stories of all of the extraordinary individuals
they have learned about are set many years ago.


 - Tell them that they are going to write about their classroom through the eyes
of one of these individuals, pretending to describe their classroom from that
individual’s perspective, or point of view. Explain that perspective is how
someone sees or experiences something.


 - Elaborate, saying that if Queen Esther were to describe their classroom, she
would probably comment about how different the world is today than in her
time. Or, if William Wilberforce were to describe their classroom, he would
probably comment on the fact that all students and their parents are free,
that slavery was no longer permitted. If William Penn were to describe their
classroom, he would probably comment on the fact that there is a map of the
United States that shows Pennsylvania and that there might be a picture of the
Constitution in the classroom that shows the Bill of Rights. He would be glad to
know that freedom of religion is listed there.


 - Give students time to write their classroom description from the perspective
of one of these people.


 - Then, allow students to share their writing with the class.


 - Have students ask each other questions pertaining to the figure they have


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


chosen. Remember to expand upon each student’s writing and response(s)
using richer and more complex language, including, if possible, any unitrelated vocabulary.


**You Were There: Fighting for a Cause**

  - Have students pretend that they were with one of the individuals in this unit
as he or she fought for a cause.


  - Ask students to describe what they saw and heard. For example, for Queen
Esther, students may talk about how she had to hide her beliefs from the king
at first, but then she showed enormous bravery when she saved the Jewish
people living in Persia. Or they may pretend they were William Penn as he
fought for religious freedom in London, or they watched William Wilberforce
give a speech before Parliament.


  - Consider also extending this activity by adding group or independent writing
opportunities associated with the “You Were There” concept.


**Who Am I?**


Materials: Sticky notes

  - On a sticky note, write the name of each figure students have learned about
thus far in _Fighting for a Cause_ .


  - Make one sticky note for each student, so that there may be more than one
or two for each figure.


  - Don’t let students see the sticky notes before beginning the activity. Place a
name onto each student’s back. Don’t let them see the name that you put on
their back.


**• Directions:** You will each have the opportunity to ask five yes or no questions
to find out who you are. You might ask, “Am I female?” or “Did I fight for
religious freedom?” “Am I from England?” Do not ask one person all five
questions. You should move around the room and ask a different student
each of your yes or no questions.


  - After everyone has asked five questions, you will all try to guess who you are.
(Encourage students to use unit vocabulary when they ask their questions.)


  - You may add variety to the game by including objects or secondary
characters in the Read-Alouds, such as King Xerxes, King Charles II, the
Lenape Native Americans, or John Newton.

~~**“WORKING FOR CIVIL RIGHTS” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 7A-1: Working for Civil Rights**

Throughout history, people have fought for

religious freedom, ~~_the ability to worship and_~~

~~_practice the religion of their choosing without_~~

~~_government interference_~~ . They worked to

convince others of the need for religious

freedom, even at great personal risk. ~~_What_~~

~~_does “great personal risk” mean?_~~ People have

also fought to end slavery. Slavery is wrong, but it was practiced in most

nations throughout history. Over time, many people, driven by the conviction,

or belief, that we are all equal in the eyes of God, recognized that slavery was

wrong and worked to convince others that it must end.


In our history, much success was achieved by people **advocating** for these

changes without resorting to violence. They would give speeches, write

books or poetry, work as lawyers, or share business opportunities that

helped provide freedom. Ultimately, the U.S. Civil War ended the practice of

slavery in our country. The ideas of the Founding Fathers and the ideas that

emerged in the Age of Enlightenment continued to impact the country well

after the Civil War. In a country built on the idea that “All Men are Created

Equal,” the laws of the country needed to provide equal protection for all of

its citizens. But for many years after the Civil War, that was still not the case.

Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


**Show Image 7A-2: The Civil Rights**
**Movement**

In the years leading up to the 1950s and

1960s, many Black Americans were subject

to discrimination based on the color of their

skin. Often, they lived in states where people

of different races were legally **segregated** .

~~_Segregation means that people of different_~~

~~_races were kept apart by law in schools, restaurants, buses, and many other_~~

~~_places._~~ They couldn’t use the same bathrooms or even drink from the same

water fountains. These rules and laws that required segregation were known

as the Jim Crow laws. They were enforced in the southern parts of the United

States, making life difficult for many Black Americans.


People all over the United States did not just accept these unfair rules. More

and more, they started to speak up to demand change. In the following

decades, a movement began to grow, which was called the civil rights

movement. This movement, which drew more support with each passing

year, worked to make sure everyone, no matter their skin color, had the same

rights under the law. Before positive changes could happen, many brave

people had to step forward. They were willing to speak out for what was right,

even if it meant facing anger, threats, or even getting hurt. These people were

willing to face **backlash** from others because they wanted to stand up for

what was right. ~~_Backlash is a strong reaction to something from a large group_~~

~~_of people._~~


**Show Image 7A-3: Jackie Robinson**

One of the people who stood up for civil

rights was Jackie Robinson. Jackie Robinson

was well-educated and a terrific athlete. He

became the first African American to play

Major League Baseball. When Jackie first

began playing Major League Baseball, some of

his fellow team members and fans treated him

badly. Jackie Robinson did not give up. Because of his courage and talent, he

changed people’s attitudes, ~~_or their views about things. What is courage?_~~

Write the statement from
Dr. King Jr. on the board,

**106**



**Show Image 7A-4: Rosa Parks**

Another fighter for civil rights was Rosa Parks.

On a cold December evening many years ago,

Parks, an African American woman, sat on a

crowded bus in Alabama. When the bus driver

asked her to give up her seat to a white man

who did not have a seat, she refused. She

found the courage to say, “No.” After Parks

was arrested, people came together and decided that they wouldn’t ride the

Montgomery City buses until everyone had the same rights as white people.

~~_How does this image help you understand what this text says about Rosa_~~

~~_Parks?_~~


**Show Image 7A-5: Martin Luther King Jr.**

Around the same time, a man named Dr.

Martin Luther King Jr. also wanted to make

things fair for everyone. He was a leader who

had big dreams of a better world. He was a

**minister**, ~~_which means he was a leader in_~~

~~_his church_~~ . His beliefs in God, peace, and

fairness were very important to him. In fact,

he supported the bus **boycott** that Rosa Parks began. ~~_Boycott means to stop_~~

~~_using or buying services or goods from a certain company._~~ He helped African

Americans come together and support each other during those long days

when they chose not to ride the bus.


Martin Luther King Jr. had an important idea: Change should come from

talking, understanding, and acting peacefully. He did not believe in fighting

or hurting others. Dr. King Jr. said, “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only

light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” ~~_What do_~~

~~_you think that statement means?_~~


**Show Image 7A-6: Cesar Chavez and Dolores**
**Huerta**

While many were speaking out for rights in

cities, there were also people working for

fairness in the fields and on farms throughout

the American Southwest. Cesar Chavez and

Dolores Huerta were two brave leaders who

wanted better lives for farm workers. During


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


the 1960s, many workers in the fields were being treated very unfairly. They

worked long hours under the hot sun, and they didn’t get paid very much.

Many of these workers were Hispanic, and they faced a lot of discrimination.

In 1962, Chavez and Huerta organized thousands of farmworkers into a

group together. Because so many people came together and demanded

change, the two found a way to improve the lives of all farmworkers, which

was part of the civil rights movement to improve equal protection under the

law for all Americans.


**Show Image 7A-7: Dr. Héctor P. García**

Cesar Chavez was a veteran who fought for

our country in World War II. After the war was

over, he kept fighting, but this time without

violence, and instead with his words. Another

veteran of World War II who did the same was

Dr. Héctor P. García. During the war, he won

a medal for his bravery. After the war was

over, he worked as a doctor to take care of people. Even more, he was one

of many people around our country who began demanding civil rights for

all Americans, to make sure that all American citizens were treated fairly.

He worked with many political leaders to make sure the laws of our country

provided equal protection to Hispanic Americans.


**Show Image 7A-8: Civil Rights Act**

All of the pressure from the civil rights

movement resulted in the signing of the

Civil Rights Act of 1964. ~~_The Civil Rights Act_~~

~~_prevented anyone from being discriminated_~~

~~_against because of their race, color, religion,_~~

~~_sex, or national origin._~~ Soon after the Civil

Rights Act became law, another important

law was passed. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 made sure that everyone,

no matter their race, could vote in elections. Before this law, many Black

Americans in the South were prevented from voting. With these new laws,

the United States began to change. Schools, parks, restaurants, and offices

started to welcome everyone, no matter their race.

Even when things were difficult, brave people from all over the country never

gave up. They faced mean words, angry shouts, and even danger. They held

onto their dreams of a place where everyone had freedom and was treated

~~**“JACKIE ROBINSON: CHAMPION OF EQUALITY” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 8A-1: Jackie Robinson**

Baseball has been a popular sport for a very

long time. But did you know that there was a

time when African American baseball players

and white baseball players were not allowed to

play together? This all changed when a man

named Jackie Robinson showed the world

what a great player he was. He showed the

world how much courage he had, too. ~~_What does the word_~~ ~~courage~~ ~~_mean?_~~

~~_(bravery when facing a dangerous or difficult situation)_~~ This is the incredible

story of Jackie Robinson.


**Show Image 8A-2: Jackie was the youngest**
**of five children**

Jack Roosevelt (Jackie) Robinson was

born in 1919, in Cairo, Georgia. He was the

youngest of five children. His parents were

sharecroppers—people who worked the land

for others for very little pay.


**TEKS 2.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and answer questions using multi-word responses;
**TEKS 2.6.A** Establish purpose for reading assigned and self-selected texts; **TEKS 2.7.C** Use text evidence to support an
appropriate response; **TEKS 2.7.F** Respond using newly acquired vocabulary as appropriate.


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


Jackie’s father left his family when Jackie was a baby. His mother, Mallie

Robinson, moved the family to Pasadena, California, to be near relatives

who would help her raise her children. The Robinsons lived in a small house

on Pepper Street. Mallie worked many different jobs to support her family.

Despite hardships, Jackie grew up in a close and loving family.


**Show Image 8A-3: Jackie played many sports**

From an early age, Jackie was a talented

athlete. When he became a student at John

Muir High School, his brothers Mack and Frank

encouraged him to play sports. Jackie played

football, basketball, baseball, and tennis, and

he ran track, too. He played shortstop and

catcher on the baseball team, quarterback on

the football team, and guard on the basketball team. In track and field, he

won awards for the long jump.


After high school, Jackie attended Pasadena Junior College. Again, he played

basketball, football, and baseball, and he ran track. On the football team, he

played quarterback and safety. He was shortstop and leadoff hitter for the

baseball team, and he broke school long jump records.


**Show Image 8A-4: Jackie at UCLA**

Before long, the University of California in Los

Angeles, also known as UCLA, offered Jackie

an athletic scholarship. ~~_What is a scholarship?_~~

Jackie was happy to accept. While at UCLA,

Jackie proved himself to be a good student

and an amazing athlete. As a UCLA student, he

competed in four sports: baseball, basketball,

football, and track. Jackie was selected for the All-American football team,

which is a team of players from different schools who are the best players in

the country.


When Jackie left college, he began playing football for the Honolulu Bears, a

Hawaiian semi-professional team. When the United States became involved

in World War II, Jackie joined the United States Army. After two years, he was

promoted to the officer rank of second lieutenant.

Lesson 8 Jackie Robinson: Champion of Equality
**119**


**120**



**Show Image 8A-5: Jackie in the military**

Growing up, Jackie had been aware of

discrimination. When Jackie joined the army,

he realized that there was discrimination there,

too. Jackie felt the need to **challenge** these

attitudes. ~~_When you challenge something, you_~~

~~_question whether something is right._~~


When Jackie was in the army, he refused an order to sit at the back of a

military bus. Jackie felt that the color of his skin should not determine where

he could or could not sit. Jackie was court-martialed, ~~_or charged with a crime,_~~

for refusing this order. However, at his trial, he was found to be not guilty.


**Show Image 8A-6: Jackie playing for the**
**Monarchs**

Jackie left the army toward the end of World

War II. He was signed to play shortstop for the

Kansas City Monarchs. The Monarchs were a

team that belonged to something called the

National Negro League. It was in this league

that African American players were allowed to

play baseball. Jackie traveled all over the Midwest during that season with

this league.


One day, a man named Branch Rickey saw Jackie play. Branch Rickey was

the president of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Branch thought that Jackie was an

incredible player. He wanted Jackie to play for his team. The only problem

was that the Brooklyn Dodgers was an all-white team. ~~_Back then, African_~~

~~_Americans and white people did not play professional sports together._~~


Branch met with Jackie and told him that he needed Jackie to be very brave.

He wanted Jackie to play in the all-white Major League Baseball program.

This was referred to as “breaking the color barrier.” This meant that, before

this time, a person’s skin color was a barrier to, or something that stopped

them from, playing in many sports leagues. Branch wanted Jackie to break

this barrier. He explained to Jackie that at first he would probably be treated

badly by most of the fans, and even by some of his fellow players. But Branch

was willing to **gamble**, ~~_or take a chance_~~ ~~,~~ that Jackie was strong enough to

break the color barrier and change attitudes. He believed that Jackie had

self-control and courage. ~~_What sort of person did Branch Rickey think Jackie_~~

~~_Robinson was?_~~


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


Before Jackie agreed, he asked Branch a question. Jackie asked, “Are you

looking for [someone] who is afraid to fight back?”


Branch replied, “No, I need a player with guts enough not to fight back.” ~~_What_~~

~~_is the word you learned that means responding to unfairness by refusing to_~~

~~_take physical action? (nonviolence)_~~ Jackie Robinson agreed to be that man.


**Show Image 8A-7: Jackie and Pee Wee Reese**

Jackie traveled to Daytona Beach, Florida,

for spring training. He began playing with

the Montreal Royals, a training team for the

Brooklyn Dodgers. Jackie played well. The

most difficult days for Jackie were often when

he was off the field and traveling with the

other players. During this time, because he

was African American, he was not allowed to stay in the same hotels as his

**teammates** . ~~_Teammates are members of the same side._~~ He could not eat at

the same restaurants and diners. Jackie did not like this one bit, but he was

determined to become the first African American Major League Baseball

player in the United States.


And then it happened. Just six days before the start of the 1947 baseball

season, Jackie got the call that he had been waiting for. The Dodgers wanted

him to play. Sadly, not all of his teammates were happy about this. Some said

they would rather sit out and miss a game than play with Jackie. But Jackie’s

teammate, Pee Wee Reese, came to his defense. “You can hate a man for

many reasons,” Pee Wee said. “Color is not one of them.”


**Show Image 8A-8: Jackie playing for the**
**Brooklyn Dodgers**

On April 15, 1947, when Jackie put on the

Brooklyn Dodgers uniform, wearing number

forty-two, he broke the color barrier. As the

first African American player on a major league

team, Jackie made his debut at Ebbets Field

before a crowd of 26,623 people, including

more than 14,000 African American fans. ~~_How do you think Jackie felt on the_~~

~~_day he finally played for the Brooklyn Dodgers?_~~



Challenge

why it might take more
courage to react in a
nonviolent way than
to react with physical
violence.

Explain that the phrase
“made his debut” means

Explain that a single
in baseball is when
a player makes it
safely to first base
after hitting the ball;
a double is when the
player makes it safely
to second base; a triple
is when the player
makes it safely to third
base; and a home run is
when the player makes
it safely back to home
plate after hitting the
ball.


**122**



Jackie knew that he would have to be strong and concentrate on the game

and nothing else. At first, there was a great deal of **hostility** . ~~_Hostility is a_~~

~~_feeling or an act of unfriendliness, anger, or dislike._~~ People called him names,

but Jackie just played baseball. Some of his teammates would not sit with

him. No matter! Game after game, Jackie focused on playing, even when

pitchers threw balls and tried to hit him.


**Show Image 8A-9: Jackie at bat**

In one game during his first year as a

professional player, Jackie received a seven
inch gash, or big cut, on his leg. It was a

deliberate injury inflicted on him during

a game between the Dodgers and the

Philadelphia Phillies. It was an attempt to

**intimidate** him. ~~_The word_~~ ~~intimidate~~ ~~_means_~~

~~_to try to make someone do something by making them afraid._~~ Still, Jackie

refused to quit. He simply said, “I’m not concerned with your liking or

disliking me . . . all I ask is that you respect me as a human being.” ~~_Do you_~~

~~_think Jackie Robinson had courage?_~~


Later in his baseball career, Jackie hit a home run, a triple, a double, and a

single in the same game.


Jackie could run, hit, steal bases, and play second base like nobody else. His

friend and teammate Duke Snider said, “He was the greatest competitor I

have ever seen.”


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


**Show Image 8A-10: Jackie as Rookie of the**
**Year**

By the end of his first year in the major

leagues, Jackie had played in 151 games for

the Dodgers, scored 125 runs, and had 175

hits, including thirty-one doubles, five triples,

and twelve home runs. He was named Rookie

of the Year. And in 1949 he was chosen as the most valuable player in the

National League. Jackie had proven that the world of professional sports is

far better when everyone can participate in it.


During Jackie’s career, the Dodgers played in six World Series. Jackie played

in every one. He could hit, and he was fast. He averaged more than 110 runs

per season from 1947 to 1953 and had a .311 career batting average. Jackie

helped the Dodgers win six National League pennants and one World Series

title. These impressive achievements make Jackie Robinson one of the best

players to have ever played Major League Baseball.


Jackie retired from baseball in 1957. Jackie said, “The way I figured it, I was

even with baseball and baseball was even with me. The game had done much

for me, and I had done much for it.”


**Show Image 8A-11: Jackie’s number is**
**honored**

Jackie Robinson was the first African

American inducted into the Baseball Hall of

Fame. He received many other honors, too. In

1997, Major League Baseball honored Jackie

by retiring his number from all Major League

Baseball teams. This is a very special honor, and it means that no other

major league player on any team can ever wear his number. ~~_What was the_~~

~~_number on Jackie Robinson’s shirt?_~~ Every year since 2004, however, all major

league players wear Jackie’s number, forty-two, every April 15 to remember

the important role Jackie Robinson played in Major League Baseball.

Check for Understanding


**Compare/Contrast:** In what ways was Jackie Robinson similar to
the people you heard about in the previous lesson? _(Rosa Parks,_
_Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, Héctor P._
_García)_ In what ways was Jackie’s fight for civil rights different?
_(Rather than march, campaign, or protest, he played a professional_
_sport and suffered through humiliation and hostility without letting_
_it stop him form becoming a great baseball player.)_


**1. Literal.** What happened to Jackie Robinson when he joined the major
leagues? _(Some players would not sit with him; he was called names; some_
_players wanted to physically hurt him; he was still not allowed to stay in the_
_hotels with his teammates.)_


**2. Inferential.** What kind of person was Branch Rickey looking for to break the
race barrier in professional baseball? _(Branch Rickey wanted someone with_
_self-control and courage—someone who could not be easily intimidated, who_
_would respond to unfair treatment with nonviolence.)_

   - **Literal.** What did Branch Rickey want Jackie to become? _(Branch Rickey_
_wanted Jackie to become the first African American to play in the all-white_
_Major League Baseball program.)_


**3. Literal.** What did Pee Wee Reese, Jackie’s teammate, do to help support
Jackie Robinson? _(Pee Wee Reese spoke up for Jackie and against racial_
_discrimination.)_


**4. Literal.** Jackie Robinson’s fight for fairness did not begin with playing
professional baseball, but, instead, it began when he was in the army. What
did Jackie do while he was in the army to challenge attitudes about race?
_(While in the army, Jackie refused to sit in the back of a military bus simply_
_because he was African American.)_


**5. Evaluative.** Think-Pair-Share: Why do you think Branch Rickey wanted a
player who would react nonviolently to the hostility and humiliation he knew
the player would face? _(Answers may vary.)_


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


~~**WORD WORK: CHALLENGE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Jackie felt the need to challenge
these attitudes.”


2. Say the word _challenge_ with me.


3. When you _challenge_ something, you question whether that thing is right
or wrong.


4. The coach decided to challenge the umpire’s call that the player swung at
the pitch.


5. Can you think of times when you wanted to challenge someone or
something? Can you think of something you want to challenge? Try to use
the word _challenge_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If
necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses: “I wanted/want to
challenge . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Horizontal Word Wall activity for follow-up.** We will make a
Horizontal Word Wall for the word _challenge_ .


 - Tell me what you think of when you hear the word _challenge_ . _(Answers may_
_vary but may include words such as_ question _and_ doubt _.)_ [For each word
proposed by students, as well as the words _challenge_, _question_, and _doubt_,
create a separate index card. Place the word _challenge_ and its synonyms on
one end of a horizontal line.]


 - Tell me what you think is the opposite of _challenge_ . _(Answers may vary_
_but may include words such as_ accept _,_ believe _, and_ trust _.)_ [For each word
proposed by students, as well as the words _accept_, _believe_, and _trust_, create a
separate index card. Place the words on the other end of the horizontal line.]


 - [After placing the initial set of words on the Horizontal Word Wall, have
students discuss the two groupings of words and consider how each word
differs from the others in its group. For example, students may say that
a person who doubts that something is true may not verbally challenge
what is being said. As a result, doubting something may be less strong than
challenging something.]

**“ROSA PARKS: THE MOTHER OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT”**
~~**(15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 9A-1: Rosa Parks**

Rosa Louise Parks was born a long time

ago, in 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama. ~~_[Point to_~~

~~_Alabama on a U.S. map.]_~~ Her family name was

McCauley. Rosa and her family were African

American. Rosa grew up on a small farm with

her brother, mother, and grandparents.


Rosa was a happy child. She loved her family.

However, Rosa lived at a time and in a place where African Americans faced

discrimination. This was especially true in the South, where Rosa lived,

because in that part of the United States there was **segregation** . ~~_Segregation_~~

~~_was the practice under law of keeping groups of people separate._~~ Because

of segregation, African Americans and white people did not go to the same

schools, eat at the same restaurants, or go to the same movie theaters. When

traveling by bus, African Americans were expected to sit in certain seats. It

was as if African Americans and white people lived in different worlds.


**TEKS 2.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and answer questions using multi-word responses;
**TEKS 2.6.A** Establish purpose for reading assigned and self-selected texts; **TEKS 2.6.E** Make connections to personal

**TEKS 2.7.F** Respond using newly acquired vocabulary as appropriate.


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


**Show Image 9A-2: Example of segregation in**
**the South**

When Rosa was a little girl, she attended a

school that was just for African American

children. It was an old, one-room schoolhouse

that only held classes for five months of each

year. Far too often, there weren’t enough desks

or school supplies for the students. Rosa

noticed that buses took white children to the

new school near where she lived.


When Rosa was eleven years old, she was sent to Montgomery, Alabama, to

continue her studies. But when she was sixteen, Rosa had to leave school to

care for her grandmother and her mother, who had both become ill. To help

support the family, Rosa worked in a shirt factory.


**Show Image 9A-3: NAACP activists,**
**including Thurgood Marshall**

When Rosa was nineteen, she married

Raymond Parks. Raymond was a barber. ~~_What_~~

~~_do you think a barber does?_~~ He was also

actively involved in the Montgomery chapter of

the National Association for the Advancement

of Colored People (NAACP). ~~_The word_~~ ~~chapter~~

~~_here means a group in a certain area that makes up one small section of a_~~

~~_larger group._~~


~~_This image shows another chapter of the NAACP from another state._~~ This

organization wanted to make life in the United States fairer and safer for

all African Americans and end segregation in the South. Rosa also became

involved and served as the Montgomery chapter secretary. In addition, she

returned to high school to earn her high school diploma.


Then came the day in Rosa’s life when she stood up for what was right.

Actually, Rosa did not stand up, and that’s the reason why we remember and

honor Rosa Parks to this day.



Support


The word _chapter_ can
also refer to one of the
main sections of a book.


Challenge


Have students predict
what the author
means by the sentence
“Actually, Rosa did not
stand up, and that’s
the reason why we
remember and honor
Rosa Parks to this day.”



Lesson 9 Rosa Parks: The Mother of the Civil Rights Movement
**135**


**136**



**Show Image 9A-4: Rosa boarding the bus**

The evening of December 1, 1955, in

Montgomery, Alabama, was cold. The streets

were full of people shopping or making their

way home from work. By this time, Rosa had

a job as a seamstress at a local department

store. Her day had just ended, and she had

rushed to catch the city bus that would take

her home. ~~_[Ask students to locate Rosa in the line waiting for the bus. (in the_~~

~~_green coat and hat) Ask them to locate Rosa on the bus when you turn to image_~~

~~_9A-5.]_~~ As Rosa boarded the bus, she could see that it was already quite full.

Because the section at the back of the bus where African Americans usually

sat was so full, Rosa found a seat near the middle of the bus.


**Show Image 9A-5: Rosa sitting on the bus**

The seat Rosa found was just behind the seats

reserved for white people. Before long, all the

seats on the bus were full, and several white

people were left standing. Back then, the bus

driver had the authority, or power, to move

people, and African Americans were the first to

be moved.


The bus driver noticed the people standing and ordered several African

American people on the bus to give up their seats. All of them did as he

asked except for Rosa. When the bus driver told Rosa that if she did not

stand up, he would call the police to come and arrest her, she quietly

responded, “You may do that.” When he asked her one more time to stand up,

Rosa responded by saying, “I don’t think I should have to stand up.” ~~_Why do_~~

~~_you think Rosa refused to stand up?_~~


**Show Image 9A-6: Rosa being fingerprinted**

The bus driver made the call, and before long,

a police officer arrived. The officer wanted to

know why she would not give up her seat. Rosa

responded by asking the officer a question.

“Why are you always pushing us around?” she

asked. Rosa was arrested and taken to the

police headquarters. Later that night, she was

released on bail. ~~_Bail is the money someone pays when he or she has been_~~

~~_arrested so he or she can stay out of jail until the trial or hearing._~~


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


The law at that time in Alabama gave bus drivers the right to **assign** seats.

~~_The word_~~ ~~assign~~ ~~_means to give or to place._~~ As a result of the consequences

that would come from refusing to give up their seats, many African American

people felt threatened and were frightened to challenge this practice. But

Rosa had done so. ~~_What does it mean to challenge something?_~~


Rosa later said that she had not planned to protest, but in that moment,

her desire for civil rights and her sense of **injustice** drove her to make that

decision. ~~Injustice~~ ~~_means a lack of fairness._~~ “When I made that decision,”

Rosa said, “I knew that I had the strength of my ancestors with me.”


This was the moment that changed history. Rosa had refused to move, and

now others would show their support for her.


**Show Image 9A-7: Crowds of people walked**
**to work**

It was decided that the hundreds of African

Americans who rode the city buses to work

would walk instead. This kind of action is

called a **boycott** . ~~_A boycott is when a group_~~

~~_of people join together and refuse to do_~~

~~_business with a company or an organization._~~

~~_In Montgomery, people refused to ride the city buses._~~ The NAACP began

to organize what became known as the Montgomery Bus Boycott. African

American women’s groups began to organize, too.


**Show Image 9A-8: Rosa and Martin Luther**
**King Jr.**

A young man named Dr. Martin Luther King

Jr. led the boycott. Dr. King said, “We will

walk until justice runs down like water and

righteousness like a mighty stream.” Beginning

on December 5, 1955, people refused to ride

the city buses in Montgomery. The boycott

lasted for 382 days. ~~_One year has 365 days in it. If the boycott lasted 382_~~

~~_days, was it shorter or longer than a year?_~~ Without passengers to ride

the buses, the buses couldn’t afford to run. At that time in Montgomery,

more than seven out of every ten riders on buses were African American.

Businesses were **disrupted** . ~~_When something is disrupted, it means that_~~

~~_certain things are prevented from happening due to possible confusion._~~ Many

white people supported the boycott, too.



Challenge


Have students explain
the meaning of the
phrase “the strength of
my ancestors with me.”



Lesson 9 Rosa Parks: The Mother of the Civil Rights Movement
**137**


**138**



On November 13, 1956, the United States Supreme Court decided that

Montgomery’s segregated bus seating was unconstitutional. That meant

that it was against the law. A court order was served on December 20, 1956,

and the boycott ended the next day. After that, buses were integrated, and

African American people could sit wherever they wanted. That boycott

became a powerful way for people to peacefully protest. ~~_When people protest_~~

~~_peacefully, they do not use violence._~~


**Show Image 9A-9: Map with Michigan and**
**Alabama highlighted**

Rosa Parks’s actions helped grow the civil

rights movement. In fact, Rosa became

known as the “mother of the civil rights

movement.” ~~_What is the civil rights movement?_~~

Rosa remained an active member of the NAACP

and other civil rights groups. She showed her

support for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. by participating in civil rights marches.


Rosa became a member of the staff of a Michigan congressman. ~~_The state of_~~

~~_Michigan is highlighted in blue in this image, and Alabama, where Rosa rode_~~

~~_the bus, is highlighted in green._~~ She worked in his office for twenty-three

years—from 1965 until she retired in 1988. Rosa also founded an institution

to help young people complete their education.


**Show Image 9A-10: Rosa receiving the Medal**
**of Freedom**

In her lifetime, Rosa received several awards

for her courage and her work. In 1979,

the NAACP awarded Rosa its Spingarn

Medal. Rosa also received two of the U.S.

government’s most important civilian honors,

or those honors given to people who aren’t

serving in our military. Rosa received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in

1996 and the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor in 1999.


Rosa once said, “I’d see the bus pass every day. But to me, that was a way

of life; we had no choice but to accept what was the custom. The bus was

among the first ways I realized there was a black world and a white world.”

Incredibly, by her own actions, Rosa Parks changed that world. Rosa became

a symbol of the power of nonviolence. ~~_What does_~~ ~~nonviolence~~ ~~_mean?_~~ Her

quiet, courageous act changed America and changed the course of history.

 - Remind students that civil rights are the rights the government promises to
every citizen in our country. Although slavery ended after the U.S. Civil War,
many African Americans still faced discrimination under the law. The fight
to ensure the laws of the United States treated everyone equally—especially
during the time of Rosa Parks—is called the civil rights movement.

 - Tell students that today they will hear about one of the most important
leaders of the civil rights movement—Martin Luther King Jr.


 - Explain that Martin Luther King Jr. was so important to our nation’s history
that there is a special day set aside each year to honor this man and what he
did to make people’s lives better.


 - Read the title of today’s Read-Aloud and ask students if they can tell what
this story might be about. Explain to students that often the title of a story

**Show Image 10A-1: Martin Luther King Jr.**

As a young African American boy growing up

in the South, Martin Luther King Jr. witnessed

and experienced discrimination. Martin knew

that it was unfair, and it made him sad. As a

young boy, he could not have known that he

would grow up to become one of the most

famous and respected civil rights **activists**

and leaders in American history. ~~_An activist is someone who takes action to_~~

~~_achieve a goal._~~ In his short life, he would challenge discrimination and change

laws and attitudes. ~~_What does it mean to challenge something?_~~ He would

bring people of all races together, and this nation would become a better

place because of him.

Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


**Show Image 10A-2: Martin Luther King Jr.’s**
**childhood home**

Martin was born in 1929 in Atlanta, Georgia.

~~_[Point to Georgia on a U.S. map.]_~~ Martin had

an older sister, Willie Christine, and a younger

brother, Alfred Daniel. He lived in a loving

home with his parents, his brother and sister,

and his grandparents. Martin’s father, Martin

Luther King Sr., was the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. Martin

was a member of his father’s church.


**Show Image 10A-3: Martin Luther King Jr.**
**and Rosa Parks**

Just like Rosa Parks and Jackie Robinson, Martin

was born during a time when African American

people in the United States faced laws that did

not treat them the same as people of other races.

Segregation kept people apart and prevented

African Americans from being full and equal

members of society. ~~_What is segregation?_~~


Martin was a very bright boy. He began attending school when he was five

years old. He was a student at Oglethorpe Elementary School. After elementary

school, Martin attended Booker T. Washington High School in Atlanta.


**Show Image 10A-4: Morehouse College**

Because he was such a good student, Martin

skipped two grades. At just fifteen years of

age, Martin became a student at Morehouse

College. Students usually start college at age

seventeen or eighteen, so Martin was very

young to be a college student. At first, Martin

considered becoming a doctor or a lawyer, but

he later changed his mind and decided to become a **minister** like his father

and grandfather before him. ~~_A minister is someone who works for a church_~~

~~_and performs religious functions and duties._~~


Lesson 10 Martin Luther King Jr.: Defender of the Dream
**149**


**150**



After graduating from Morehouse, Martin attended Crozer Theological

Seminary. There his studies prepared him for his work as a minister. Martin

completed his education at Boston University. He received his doctorate

when he was just twenty-five years old. ~~_A doctorate is the highest academic_~~

~~_honor or degree awarded to a student. When someone receives a doctorate,_~~

~~_they are called “doctor.” Martin was known as Dr. King._~~


**Show Image 10A-5: Martin Luther King Jr.**
**and his wife, Coretta**

Martin had not only gained a doctorate

in Boston, he had also gained a wife—a

beautiful young lady named Coretta Scott.

Coretta had been studying music at the

New England Conservatory in Boston. Upon

Martin receiving his doctorate, he and Coretta

moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where he became the minister of the

Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. Martin was now ready to begin the career he

had prepared for.


**Show Image 10A-6: Rosa Parks on the bus**

As a young teenager riding city buses in

the South, Martin had experienced the

same discrimination that Rosa Parks had

experienced. ~~_What was the discrimination_~~

~~_that Rosa, Martin, and others experienced on_~~

~~_buses?_~~ African Americans had to sit at the

back of the bus, and if the bus was full, the

driver would ask a person of color to stand up so that a white person could

sit down. Martin thought it was humiliating. And so, as well as being a pastor

in Montgomery, Alabama, Martin decided that he would become a civil rights

activist. ~~_What is an activist?_~~


When Rosa Parks challenged racial segregation in the Montgomery city

bus system, and a bus boycott began, Martin was asked to be the leader of

this movement. ~~_What is a boycott?_~~ The African American community stood

together under his leadership. They refused to ride the buses until they were

able to choose a seat freely.


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


**Show Image 10A-7: Civil rights march**

The boycott lasted more than a year. People

walked, rode bicycles, and rode in car pools to

get to work.


Martin led the boycott. Martin and his fellow

activists were threatened and intimidated, but

they did not back down. Finally, the United

States Supreme Court, the most powerful

court in the country, ruled that bus segregation was illegal and had to stop.

At that moment, Martin became one of the most important people in the

American civil rights movement. In fact, Martin became its leader. ~~_How do_~~

~~_you think African American people felt when bus segregation was finally_~~

~~_declared to be against the law?_~~


Martin was prepared to be the leader of the civil rights movement even

though he knew he was putting himself and his family in danger. There were

many people who did not like the changes he and his fellow activists wanted.

For his part, despite the dangers, he insisted that those involved in the civil

rights movement remain peaceful and never use force. ~~_What is the word you_~~

~~_learned in the first Read-Aloud in this unit that refers to this type of peaceful_~~

~~_response to unfair treatment? (nonviolence)_~~ Martin said “true pacifism, or

nonviolent resistance, is a courageous confrontation of evil by the power of

love.” He greatly admired other pacifists who used nonviolence to protest.


**Show Image 10A-8: Martin Luther King Jr.**
**delivering a sermon**

Martin and sixty other ministers and activists

founded the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference. This was an excellent way to

organize members of African American

churches throughout the country. They all

worked together to try to bring about social

changes that would improve the lives of all Americans. They also set out to

register African Americans in the South to vote so that they could use the

power of their vote to bring about change.

Explain that a car pool
is when people share

Lesson 10 Martin Luther King Jr.: Defender of the Dream
**151**


**152**



In his first speech to this group, Martin said, “We have no alternative but

to protest. For many years we have shown an amazing patience. We have

sometimes given our white brothers the feeling that we liked the way we

were being treated. But we come here tonight to be saved from that patience

that makes us patient with anything less than freedom and justice.”


**Show Image 10A-9: Lunch counter sit-in**

And so it began. African Americans living in

southern states where segregation was legal

began to protest. Young African American

students began to hold **sit-ins** at lunch

counters that would not serve them. ~~_Sit-ins_~~

~~_were nonviolent protests that involved people_~~

~~_sitting down in specific locations. [Point to the_~~

~~_lunch counter in the image and explain that such counters were common in_~~

~~_restaurants during the 1950s and 1960s.]_~~


Many people of different races supported the civil rights movement. People

rode buses from state to state and protested in places that practiced

segregation. Over and over again, they “sat in” at lunch counters, waiting

rooms, and college campuses. Many people were arrested for taking part in

these peaceful protests.


**Show Image 10A-10: Martin Luther King Jr.**
**preaching from the pulpit**

Martin and his family moved to Atlanta, where

he worked with his father at the Ebenezer

Baptist Church. Both Martin’s father and

grandfather were ministers who had, during

their lifetimes, worked to make sure that laws

treated people of different races equally.


The civil rights movement kept going. Martin and others continued to

demonstrate peacefully and to lead marches. During one demonstration in

Birmingham, Alabama, Martin was sent to jail. There he wrote his famous

“Letter from the Birmingham Jail.” In this letter, he explained that it was his

view that whereas just, or fair, laws must be obeyed, unjust, or unfair, laws,

such as segregation laws, must be ignored.


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


**Show Image 10A-11: Martin Luther King Jr.**

The following year, Martin led a march on

Washington, D.C., to pressure the government

into changing segregation laws in southern

states. More than two hundred thousand

people walked from the Washington

Monument to the Lincoln Memorial. There

in front of the Memorial, Martin delivered

his famous “I Have a Dream” speech. He said that he hoped for a day when

people would be judged not by the color of their skin “but by the content of

their **character** .” ~~Character~~ ~~_means how a person is on the inside, and how_~~

~~_they act or treat other people, which often reveals who they really are._~~


Later, Martin was given one of the highest awards anyone can achieve: the

Nobel Peace Prize. With this award came $54,000 in prize money, which he

donated to a number of civil rights groups.


**Show Image 10A-12: Martin Luther King Jr.**
**giving a speech**

Martin often felt threatened. He often feared

for his own safety and that of his family. In his

lifetime, Martin was jailed thirty times. But he

was a peaceful warrior who fought with words.

Sadly, in 1968, this courageous man was killed.


This terrible tragedy happened in Memphis,

Tennessee. Martin had gone to that city to support workers who were not

being treated fairly. Martin seemed to have had a feeling that he would not

live to see the changes he so wanted. The night before he perished, Martin

told a crowd gathered to hear him speak, “I’ve seen the promised land. I may

not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we, as a people,

will get to the promised land.” He even quoted from the Battle Hymn of the

Republic, with the final words of the speech being “Mine eyes have seen the

glory of the coming of the Lord.”

**Show Image 10A-13: Martin Luther King Jr.**
**monument**

Immediately after his death, much of the country

was in mourning. But because of Martin Luther

King Jr. and those people involved in the civil rights

movement, a law was passed called the Civil Rights

Act, which **banned** segregation. ~~Banned~~ ~~_means_~~

~~_stopped or prohibited something._~~


This was followed by a law called the Voting Rights Act, which removed any

restrictions on the right to vote for African Americans. Martin Luther King Jr.

had led the way for a better, brighter future for all people.


Almost twenty years after his death, the United States Congress decided

that the third Monday in January would become a federal holiday in Martin’s

honor. On this day, we remember this **extraordinary** man for all that he

achieved. ~~Extraordinary~~ ~~_describes something that is incredible or out of the_~~

~~_ordinary._~~ This day is now celebrated as a national day of service, where all

people are encouraged to find ways to help others, just as Martin did during

his life.


There is also a monument not far from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington,

D.C., from which Martin delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech. It

opened to the public in August 2011. It is the first monument on the Mall to

honor an African American.


The young boy who experienced discrimination grew up to become a

national hero.

 - Explain that these people are Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. Chavez and
Huerta, like many others, worked in California picking grapes and harvesting
other crops when they were ready to be harvested. Neither one owned their
own farm. They worked on farms owned by other people, and they had
to travel from farm to farm looking for work. Life for workers like Chavez
and Huerta was very difficult, so they worked to improve the lives of these
workers.

**“CESAR CHAVEZ AND DOLORES HUERTA: PROTECTORS OF**
~~**WORKERS’ RIGHTS” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 11A-1: Cesar Chavez**

Cesar Estrada Chavez [/sae*zar/]

[/ es*trad* ə /] [/cho*vez/] was born in 1927,

in the Gila [/hee*l ə/] River Valley, near Yuma

[/yoo*m ə/], Arizona. ~~_[Point to Arizona on a U.S._~~

~~_map.]_~~ As the second of six children, Cesar and

his siblings loved to explore the golden desert

landscape and to gaze up at the sparkling

desert sky that seemed to stretch on forever. Cesar was named after his

grandfather, who had come to the United States from Mexico in the 1880s.

Cesar’s grandfather had settled on a small ranch in the Gila River Valley.


This was the very same ranch on which Cesar and his family now
lived and worked. The Chavez family worked hard, and their farm was
prosperous. ~~Prosperous~~ ~~_means thriving or making money._~~ Then tragedy
struck. Rain stopped falling in the Gila River Valley—first one year, and then
the next. Without rain, the crops could not grow, and the cattle died. This
was also the time of the Great Depression, and Cesar’s family, like so many

others, lost their home. There was nothing else to do but to sell the ranch.

**Show Image 11A-2: Migrant workers picking**
**fruits and vegetables**

And so, when he was ten years old, Cesar

and his family moved to California to become

**migrant workers** —people who traveled from

farm to farm, picking fruits and vegetables

during harvest time. ~~_A migrant worker is a_~~

~~_person who travels from one area to another,_~~

~~_often in search of work, such as harvesting crops. [Point to California on a U.S._~~

~~_map.]_~~ Like most migrant workers of the time, Cesar and his family were poor

and were often treated unfairly by the people who hired them. They were paid

very little money for the work that they did, and that work was very difficult.


**Show Image 11A-3: Migrant worker camp**

Cesar and his family had to live in many

different migrant worker camps. The camps

were overcrowded, and many families had

to share one bathroom. The Chavez family

missed their ranch. They dreamed of going

back to Arizona one day and buying back their

home. However, at the time migrant workers

earned just a few cents a day for the backbreaking work that they did. There

was no chance of ever being able to save money.


Cesar’s family was Hispanic because they were descendants of people

from a Spanish-speaking country. Their family’s national origin was Mexico.

Hispanic people, just like African Americans, faced discrimination and

segregation. ~~_What do the terms_~~ ~~discrimination~~ ~~_and_~~ ~~segregation~~ ~~_mean?_~~

However, Cesar’s family celebrated their Mexican **heritage**, and they spoke

Spanish, the language of their ancestral home. ~~_The word_~~ ~~heritage~~ ~~_means_~~

~~_the culture, traditions, and items that are handed down from generation to_~~

~~_generation._~~


Although it wasn’t always easy, Cesar did go to school in various places in

California. In fact, he went to more than thirty different schools. He later said

that he was lucky to have graduated from middle school because his family

moved around so much. Later in his life, Cesar told a story about an incident

that happened to him at school. One day, Cesar accidently spoke Spanish

instead of English in his classroom, and his teacher punished him. The laws

at the time allowed schools to discriminate based on nationality. Cesar felt

he had been treated unfairly, and it made him sad.

**Show Image 11A-4: Cesar joins the navy**

It was not possible for Cesar to go on to high

school. He was needed to work in the fields.

However, during World War II, Cesar wanted

to serve his country. He joined the navy,

and his family was very proud of him. ~~_What_~~

~~_does it mean to be proud of someone or_~~

~~_something?_~~ After two years in the U.S. Navy,

Cesar returned to life as a migrant farmworker. Soon after his return, Cesar

met and fell in love with Helen Fabela. The couple married and moved to San

Jose, California.


**Show Image 11A-5: Migrant workers tending**
**to crops**

Cesar was one of the many Hispanic people

who worked as migrant workers, moving from

farm to farm to harvest fruits and vegetables.

The work was so hard, and the hours were

so long, that many workers found that their

health suffered. ~~_Why do you think the workers_~~

~~_suffered from bad health?_~~ They worked seven days a week, often fourteen

hours a day, for very little pay. If they were injured or became sick, they found

it difficult to pay medical bills. These migrant workers were only employed

during harvest time. And, of course, migrant workers did not earn money

when bad weather prevented them from working, while waiting for crops to

ripen, or when they traveled from job to job. At the time, workers of Mexican

national origin could be discriminated against because of their nationality,

and so could not come together to demand better pay. Cesar believed that

something had to change. He believed that these migrant workers deserved

to be treated more fairly. He set out to change the treatment of farmworkers,

and especially migrant workers in California.


**Show Image 11A-6: Cesar meeting with**
**workers**

One day, Cesar met an **organizer** for a social

service group known as the Community

Service Organization, also known as the

CSO. ~~_An organizer is someone who brings_~~

~~_people and ideas together to accomplish a_~~

~~_certain goal._~~ This organization also wanted


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


to improve the lives of Hispanic people. Cesar volunteered to be a CSO

community organizer. He went from farm to farm, helping some farmworkers

with their day-to-day problems, and **instructing** others on how to become

U.S. citizens. ~~_Instructing is teaching or guiding someone to do something._~~

He encouraged all farmworkers to register to vote, and he helped to register

thousands of new voters. ~~_The word_~~ ~~register~~ ~~_here means to sign up to vote._~~


Cesar was shy. He did not like speaking in front of large groups of people,

but he knew that his work was important. He became the leader of a new

CSO group in California. In addition to speaking Spanish, Cesar spoke very

good English. As a result, he was able to communicate with both the farm

owners, most of whom spoke English, and the farmworkers, most of whom

spoke Spanish. Slowly, many farmworkers became brave enough to attend

meetings and rallies organized by Cesar. Without intending to, Cesar had

become a labor leader and civil rights activist. ~~_What is an activist?_~~


**Show Image 11A-7: Dolores Huerta**

Dolores Huerta also set out to change the

treatment of farmworkers as an activist.

Dolores Huerta was born on April 10, 1930,

in Dawson, New Mexico to Alicia and Juan

Fernandez. ~~_[Point to New Mexico on a U.S._~~

~~_map]_~~ Huerta was one of three children.

Juan, Dolores’ father, was a farm worker and

miner. When Dolores was 3 years old, her parents divorced. So, Alicia moved

Dolores and her other children to Stockton, California. ~~_[Point to California_~~

~~_on a U.S. map]_~~ Dolores’ grandfather raised her and her siblings while Alicia

worked various jobs.


As she grew up and continued her education, Huerta received an associate

teaching degree from the University of the Pacific’s Delta College. In the

1950’s, Huerta taught at school where many of the students were children

of struggling farmers. Huerta’s experiences as a teacher encouraged her to

help farm workers. She noticed the struggles the farmers and their children

faced and she wanted to help.


Huerta officially started her career as an activist in 1955. She co-founded the

Stockton chapter of the Community Service Organization (CSO) and founded

the Agricultural Workers Association. Through her work at CSO, she met

Cesar Chavez. They discovered that they both had a desire to help organize

farm workers in order to improve their lifestyle.

**Show Image 11A-8: Chavez and Huerta create**
**the NFWA**

Chavez and Huerta believed that all farm

workers needed a union to represent their best

interests. A union is a large, organized group of

workers who join together and elect leaders to

speak for them. The union leaders try to make

sure the members’ needs are being met.


Chavez and Huerta knew that a union would

have the power to increase wages, or pay, and provide health care for

farmworkers. And so Chavez and Huerta decided to set up a union called

the National Farm Workers Association. Chavez said, “You are never strong

enough that you don’t need help,” and the union was intended to provide that

help. Within two years, they had one thousand members.


Chavez thought Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had the right idea about protesting

in a nonviolent way. Chavez and Huerta decided to do the same thing. Chavez

led marches, fasts, and boycotts, but never violent protests. ~~_A fast is when a_~~

~~_person does not eat for a period of time. What is a boycott?_~~


**Show Image 11A-9: Chavez and Huerta lead**
**the strike**

One of the most important farmworkers’

strikes Chavez and Huerta led was against

grape growers in California. ~~_Strikes are_~~

~~_stoppages of work that continue until an_~~

~~_employer and the workers agree on things such_~~

~~_as more wages, better working conditions, etc._~~

At the time Chavez said, “The fight is never

about grapes or lettuce. It is always about people.”


The strike began in Delano, California, where grape growers had decided to

cut the little pay the farmworkers received, so the workers were earning even

less money.


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


**Show Image 11A-10: Chavez organizes the**
**protest march and Huerta negotiates**

Cesar responded by organizing not only a

strike, but a protest march, too. Thousands

of farmworkers set off for the state capital of

Sacramento. They walked for hours each day

in the hot sunshine. More and more workers

left the vineyards and joined in the march.

People across the nation noticed what was happening. Many people refused

to buy California grapes in sympathy for the plight of the workers. ~~_A plight is_~~

~~_a very bad situation._~~


Meanwhile, on behalf of the National Farm Workers Association, Dolores

worked on negotiations with farm owners. ~~_A negotiation is an agreement that_~~

~~_is made after a discussion. Despite her efforts, many owners still refused to_~~

~~_compromise._~~


**Show Image 11A-11: Grapes on the vine**

While farmworkers were marching, they

weren’t harvesting the valuable grapes.

The farm owners watched in horror as their

precious crops withered and died on the vine.

They discovered that without their workers,

they would lose money. The farm owners


care for the farmworkers. The farmworkers’ march to Sacramento became

the longest protest march in American history.


This was indeed a victory, but there was more work to be done. Chavez and

Huerta defended farmworkers and migrant workers in many other cases of

unfair treatment. Thousands of people joined their union, and offices opened

all over the country. Eventually, this union became known as the United Farm

Workers.

**Show Image 11A-12: Chavez and Huerta**
**protesting against use of pesticides**

Later, the United Farm Workers protested

against grape growers who used pesticides,

or poisons intended to kill insects, mice, and

rats, on their crops. These pesticides harmed

workers who harvested the grapes. Chavez

and Huerta called for another boycott of California grapes. Throughout their

lifetime, Chavez and Huerta dedicated themselves to working for the rights

of poor migrant farmworkers who seemed to have no voice in society. ~~_This_~~

~~_doesn’t mean they didn’t actually have voices. It means they didn’t have much_~~

~~_authority or power, so not many people listened to them._~~


Cesar Chavez died in 1993. Thousands of people attended his funeral. One

year after his death, Chavez was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom,

the highest civilian honor in the United States. His wife, Helen, accepted the

award. During his lifetime, Chavez often encouraged his fellow farmworkers

by saying “Sí, se puede!” [/see/] [/s ə /] [/pwed*ae/]—“Yes, we can.” And he,

alongside Dolores Huerta, certainly did.

~~**“DR. HÉCTOR P. GARCÍA: TEXAS HERO” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 12A-1: Dr. Héctor P. García**

Dr. Héctor P. García was a true hero. During his

life, he was many things: a doctor, a soldier,

and a leader who always stood up for what

was right. As a doctor, he dedicated himself

to healing those who were unwell. He believed

that every child, no matter who they were,

deserved a good education. And because he

had once been a soldier, he felt a deep connection to other veterans, so he

worked to help veterans throughout his life. ~~_Veterans are people who served_~~

~~_in the military._~~ As a doctor, a veteran, and a proud Texan, Dr. García is an

example of how one person’s kindness, courage, and determination to do

what is right can make a huge difference. Dr. Héctor P. García began his life’s

journey in Mexico, where he was born in 1914. When he was a young child,

fighting broke out in Mexico over who would control the government. His

family, looking for a better future and safer home, moved to Texas. Growing

up, Héctor noticed some people weren’t always kind to those from Mexico.

He saw signs in front of some businesses that said that people of certain

races were not allowed inside. Even as a young boy, he felt how unfair this

was and wanted to do something about it.

**Show Image 12A-2: Education**

Growing up, Héctor wanted to learn as much

as he could. He went to the University of

Texas, studied hard, and became a doctor. But

before he could start his **medical practice**,

the United States went to war. As a patriotic

American, Héctor joined the army and became

a soldier.


**Show Image 12A-3: Military Service**

During World War II, Héctor showed great

bravery and courage. For his heroism, he

earned special medals such as the Bronze

Star. When the war was over and Dr. García

came back to Texas, he remembered the

lessons he learned as a soldier. He had

protected his country from danger, and now he wanted to protect people in

his country from being treated unfairly. He knew it was time to stand up for

what was right, just like he did during the war.


**Show Image 12A-4: Life’s work**

After World War II, Dr. García chose to live in

Corpus Christi, Texas. This city by the gulf was

where he started his journey as a healer. Here,

he opened his medical practice, but his office

was not like every other doctor’s. Dr. García

believed everyone deserved care, no matter

what. He knew some people didn’t have a lot of money, but that didn’t matter

to him. Everyone was welcome. He witnessed how hard life was for struggling

veterans, migrant workers, and their families. Dr. García wanted to do more

for these families if he could. He saw things around him that weren’t fair and

wanted to help make them right. He knew the feeling of being treated unfairly

just because of where he was born or the color of his skin. He decided that

he had to do something about it. He joined groups that worked to make sure

everyone was treated fairly, regardless of race. In 1947, Dr. García faced a

new battle. This time, it wasn’t on a distant battlefield, but within his own

body. He became seriously ill. Lying in his hospital bed, he had time to think

about his life and what he wanted to achieve. While there, he overheard some

people talking about schools where certain children weren’t allowed because

of where they were from or the color of their skin. He made a promise: If he

got better, he would stand up to make sure all Americans had freedoms that

were equally protected under the law.


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


**Show Image 12A-5: American GI Forum**

Once Dr. García was healthy again, he worked

even harder to make sure everyone got a fair

chance in life. He especially wanted to help

veterans, those who served as soldiers, like Dr.

García did in World War II. He had noticed that

many veterans he knew felt lost. Often these

veterans didn’t know how to ask the government for the help or the medical

benefits they deserved after serving. Dr. García wanted to change that. In

1948, just a year after his recovery from his illness, Dr. García started the

American GI Forum, a group devoted to helping veterans. The American GI

Forum helped these veterans understand their rights and get the help they

needed. The American GI Forum sprouted like a tree, with branches in over

forty Texas towns and stretching into thirty-three other states. It was popular

because it filled a great need in Texas and elsewhere.


**Show Image 12A-6: Arlington National**
**Cemetery**

Dr. García’s work didn’t stop there. In 1949,

Private (Pvt.) Felix Longoria, a Mexican
American war hero, passed away. However,

when his family tried to have a funeral for

him in Texas, the caretakers of the cemetery

refused because of the Longorias’ race. Dr. García knew that this was

not what America stood for. He spoke out against how unfair he felt this

treatment was. With Dr. García’s help, as well as support from a young Texas

senator named Lyndon B. Johnson, Pvt. Longoria was honored with a burial

in the famous Arlington National Cemetery outside of Washington, D.C.


**Show Image 12A-7: A role model for all**

Dr. Héctor P. García was a role model. ~~_A role_~~

~~_model is someone we can look up to, someone_~~

~~_who shows us how to be better people._~~ Dr.

García was just that kind of person. Every time

he saw someone who wasn’t being granted

the freedoms they were due under the law, he

would speak up. Even when things got tough or people disagreed with him,

he showed respect. He also believed in the power of the people’s voice. That

means he thought it was really important for everyone to have a say in how

things were run, especially in government. García also continued to support

the value of education. He often said that going to school and learning was

the best way to fight against unfairness. His love of education came from his

parents. His father had been a teacher in Mexico, and he valued education

as a way for his children to have a better life. Eventually, five of Dr. García’s

siblings would become doctors, just like their brother Héctor.


**Show Image 12A-8: Lasting impact**

As years passed, Dr. García continued to serve

his community in every way he could. Even

when he got older, he was always there when

needed. He was respected for speaking at the

funerals of soldiers and veterans. Dr. García

wanted to honor them with his words. He

never turned down a request to speak at a veteran’s funeral. In 1968, he got

a very important job. He was chosen to be a part of the U.S. Commission on

Civil Rights. ~~_[What are civil rights?]_~~ This group’s job was to make sure that

everyone was treated fairly, no matter their skin color or where they were

from. His role on the commission was a big honor and showed how much

people respected Dr. García.


**Show Image 12A-9: Héctor P. García Day**

Dr. García was honored for his lifetime of

work fighting to make our country better. In

1984, President Reagan awarded Dr. García

the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Later, the

state of Texas decided to honor Dr. García

on the third Wednesday of each September

by celebrating “Dr. Héctor P. García Texas State Recognition Day.” It’s a day

to remember everything he did and to honor his dream of a world filled

with freedom for everyone under the law. Today, we remember Dr. García

as a Texas hero. He wasn’t just a doctor or a soldier or a leader. He was an

example of how to be a good person. He showed us that, when we stand up

for what is right, we can make the world a better place.

  - Remind students that a preposition is a word that can help tell where
something is taking place. Worlds like _in_, _out_, _under_, _above_, etc. are called
prepositions. Prepositions are useful in making simple sentences longer and
more interesting.

**186**


  - Remind students that a prepositional phrase is a phrase that begins with
a preposition and is followed by an object _(e.g., in the cave, on the table,_
_under the rock, above the clouds.)_ . A prepositional phrase answers the same
question, where, that a preposition answers about something in a sentence.


  - Remind students that when they edit their writing, they make corrections
to capitalization, usage, punctuation, and spelling. When they revise their
writing, they look for ways to improve the writing, or make it better.

poem on Activity Page 12.1.


  - After students finish rewriting their poems, explain that the next step in the
process is publishing. This step in the writing process is the one in which
students will prepare their writing to be read or heard by an audience.


  - Allow students to present their poems to the class, or alternatively, blind all
students’ final free verse poems into a single book that students can read.

West Africa. The capital of Sierra Leone is

Freetown. Sierra Leone is a beautiful country

known for many great things. It has large

farmlands, majestic mountains, forests,

different types of fruits and vegetables like rice, potatoes, groundnuts, corn,

plantains, oranges, pineapples and so much more! Rice is a very important

food in Sierra Leone and is made into different kinds of meals. Football, also

known as soccer in the United States, is a popular sport that children and

adults both enjoy. Sometimes you can see them playing in the streets in

season and the dry season. In the rainy season, there are heavy rains and

sometimes storms. In the dry season, it is mainly hot and humid. Basically,

**Show Image 13A-2: Kelvin Doe**

Kelvin Bokai Doe [/d*ou/] was born in

Freetown, Sierra Leone, on October 26,

1996. He is the youngest of five children. In

his neighborhood, electricity was unstable.

Sometimes they had power in their homes,

and sometimes they did not. This made life

challenging for the people in his neighborhood.

It was more difficult to carry on with daily activities like cooking, keeping the

lights on, or watching TV. Kelvin decided to do something to help. Kelvin says,

“Creativity is universal and can be found in places where one does not expect

to find it.” This is because you can always make new things or think of new

ideas anywhere and anytime. He also believed that simple things could fix big

problems. ~~_What does the word_~~ ~~creativity~~ ~~_mean? What clues from the text did_~~

~~_you use? Can you think of a time you used your creativity? What new thing did_~~

~~_you make? Or what new idea did you have?_~~ He got **inspiration** from all the

different things he found in the trash. ~~_The word_~~ ~~inspiration~~ ~~_means something_~~

~~_that makes someone want to do something or gives someone an idea about_~~

~~_what to do._~~ He began to collect devices that people threw away or **discarded**,

and any scrap metal he found laying around. ~~_The word_~~ ~~scrap~~ ~~_means pieces_~~

~~_of things that are thrown away or left over._~~ He began collecting these things

when he was ten years old.


Using what he collected, Kelvin taught himself how to make new things

that could help his community. He made big batteries that could power

the surrounding homes in his neighborhood. He also created his own radio

station and built an FM radio transmitter, which is something used in radio

stations to communicate through the radio. He used this to share news

and information with the people in his community. He played music at his

station and encouraged young people to have debates and talks about

how to make the country better. People in his community began to call

him DJ Focus because of his hard work, **perseverance**, and determination

to make his country better. Even when things got hard, he never gave up,

**Show Image 13A-3: Kelvin speaking to**
**children**

Kelvin was very ambitious and had a passion for learning. At the age

of thirteen, he taught himself how to invent and build new things. He

also participated in a contest for inventors and was **recognized** by the

educational YouTube channel THNKR, news stations, colleges, government

programs, and other young people all over the world. ~~_The word_~~ ~~recognized~~

~~_means to know, remember, and give special attention to someone for what_~~

~~_they have done._~~ His goal in life is to continue to **empower** other kids and

improve his country. ~~_To_~~ ~~empower~~ ~~_means to give power to someone. In what_~~

~~_ways do you think Kelvin has empowered the people in his community?_~~

Through his inventions, he became one of the youngest people to be invited

to the Visiting Practitioner’s Program at the Massachusetts Institute of

Technology, a top university in the United States. He also speaks to many

adults and kids and teaches them how to invent things like he does. In 2016,

he was asked to become a member of a foundation that gives free medical

care to people who suffer from war and poverty.


As a result of this, he created his own foundations in 2016 called KDoe-Tech

and the Kelvin Doe Foundation. His foundations are dedicated to empowering

young people in Africa to become inventors and have the courage to make

their communities better.


**Show Image 13A-4: Kelvin Doe the inventor**


Now Kelvin is an adult and currently lives
in Canada, where he continues to study
engineering. He is also known as an
**entrepreneur** because he has started several
businesses to help his family and community.
He has met so many important leaders from
different countries in the world. Kelvin’s life
reminds us of the value in helping others and learning new things to make
ourselves better. Kelvin says, “The more I’m able to empower myself, the
more I can do things that sustain the world as a whole.” He teaches us that
we can learn and do simple things to help make our communities better. He

_neighborhood.)_


4. **Inferential.** Why has Kelvin been successful with his inventions and plans?
_(Kelvin always worked hard and never gave up. He was always learning and_
_always looked for new ways to help people. He also persevered through_
_difficult situations.)_


5. **Inferential.** From a young age, Kelvin has always been creative. What caused
this creativity? _(Kelvin has always been creative because he found inspiration_
_from things he found around his community. He never stopped learning, kept_
_on collecting things people threw away, and turned them into something new.)_


6. **Evaluative.** Think-Pair-Share: Kelvin Doe turned things people threw away
into new, useful things. Do you think this could be a useful way to help the
environment? Why or why not? _(Answers may vary but should use evidence_
_from the text.)_


~~**WORD WORK: INSPIRATION (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud, you heard the words, “He got inspiration from all the
different things he found in the trash.”


2. The word _inspiration_ is a combination of the word _inspire_ and the suffix _-tion_ .
What does the word _inspire_ mean?


3. _Inspire_ means to make (someone) want to do something or to give
(someone) an idea about what to do or create. When you add the suffix _-tion_
to the end of the word _inspire_, it becomes _inspiration_ . If you have inspiration
from something or someone, that means you have a deep feeling to do
something because of it.

**Show Image 14A-1: Mikaila Ulmer and**
**the bees**


Buzzzzzz bzzzzz! Who remembers this
sound? It’s the sound of the honeybee! Your
social insect friend that you learned about
earlier this year. Did you miss me? ~~_Why are_~~
~~_honeybees called social insects?_~~ Well, I’m
back, and I’m here to tell you about a very
special friend. Her name is Mikaila Ulmer, and she is an **ambassador** for us
bees. ~~_An ambassador is someone who speaks up for or represents another._~~
~~_It could be for a government, a group of people, or something they believe in._~~
Mikaila is our ambassador because she works everyday to help honeybees.


Mikaila was born in Austin, Texas, and lives there with her mother and father.
When she was four years old, she was stung by a bee twice in one week. It
wasn’t me, but I am still sorry, Mikaila. We do not sting people very often,
so this was unusual. After, being stung, Mikaila became scared of bees. To
help Mikaila **cope** with her fear, her parents suggested that she do some
research on honeybees. ~~_The word_~~ ~~cope~~ ~~_means to handle problems or difficult_~~

~~_situations in a successful way._~~ They hoped that if she understood bees, she
would be less scared.


**Show Image 14A-2: A suited beekeeper**
**looking at a honeycomb frame**


Mikaila’s parents were right. As she learned
more about bees, she wasn’t afraid of them
anymore. Instead, she was **fascinated** by
the things bees can do. ~~_The word_~~ ~~fascinated~~
~~_means to be very interested in something or_~~
~~_someone. What are some things that fascinate_~~
~~_you?_~~ She learned about how important bees are to the environment because
we are pollinators. ~~_What does a pollinator do? A pollinator carries pollen from_~~
~~_one plant to another._~~ She learned that bees help flowers, trees, and other
plants grow. Without bees, some plants would not exist. Sadly, she also found
out that we are dying rapidly. ~~_When something happens rapidly, it means it is_~~
~~_happening quickly; at a fast pace, or in a short time._~~ Over the years, we bees
have had a difficult time. Some of our colonies have suffered from pesticides
used on plants. ~~_Think back—what are pesticides used for?_~~


Mikaila wanted to help, and she started thinking of what to do. While
she was thinking, she remembered a special lemonade recipe from her
grandmother’s cookbook. She decided to produce and sell lemonade for
consumers to buy. ~~_A consumer is someone who buys a good or service_~~
~~_with money._~~ Mikaila would use the money she raised to help protect the
bees. But her lemonade had a twist. She used honey instead of sugar in her
grandmother’s recipe, and she called it “Me & the Bees Lemonade.” ~~_Have_~~
~~_you tasted honey before? What does it taste like?_~~ She created a lemonade
stand where she sold her drinks, and taught people about the importance
of bees. People loved her lemonade, and her idea grew. With the help of her
family, she created a business and sold over one hundred and forty thousand
bottles. Now her lemonade can be found in many grocery stores and
restaurants.


Mikaila continues to advocate for the bees by educating people on the
problems bees face. She also gives money from her lemonade sales to
foundations and groups that help protect bees all over the world. According
to Mikaila, “Buy a bottle . . . Save a bee!” Thanks, Mikaila, for being our bee
ambassador! Well, friends, it’s goodbye for now from your social insect
friend, the honeybee. Now I will pass it on to my insect friend, the monarch
butterfly, to tell you about more special friends! Oh, I think our friend the
butterfly is asleep. Say it with me: “Wake up, butterfly!”

**Anderson, and the butterflies**


I’m awake! Hello, it is I, the beautiful monarch
butterfly. Please excuse me, I just woke up
from my cocoon. You caught me at a great
time. I was once a caterpillar, and now I am a
beautiful orange and black butterfly. I woke up
to tell you about two students who are working
to protect their environment and monarch butterflies like me.


In south central Texas, there is a school named Blanco Middle School.
You see, butterflies travel from north to south each fall, and this school is
along my way. For butterflies to **thrive**, we need milkweed plants to help
protect and feed our eggs and larvae. ~~_To_~~ ~~thrive~~ ~~_means to grow or develop_~~
~~_successfully._~~ We also need nectar plants to feed on as we continue our
journey from Texas to Mexico. Unfortunately, we do not see a lot of these
things along our way, which makes it hard for us to grow. Luckily, there
are two special friends from Blanco Middle School who became our
ambassadors.


Sydney Etzel and Lauren Anderson are eighth-grade students who love
**ecology** . ~~_Ecology is the study of living things and their environment._~~ Their
favorite topic was the life cycle of the monarch butterfly. They were so
fascinated by butterflies and their migration journey that they searched for
ways to help. They wanted to build a pollinator garden that would serve as a
safe habitat for the butterflies, but building a garden would cost a lot of
money. Thankfully, Sydney and Lauren’s ecology teacher told them about a
**grant** from the government that they could apply for to help raise money for
the garden. ~~_The word_~~ ~~grant~~ ~~_here means an amount of money that is given to_~~
~~_someone by a government or a company._~~ Although they were young, they
believed in themselves and were encouraged by their teacher to apply.


**Show Image 14A-4: Working on the garden**


Sydney and Lauren spent months planning.
They researched and spent time figuring out
how much things for the garden would cost.
They called businesses for help and explained
the costs and the benefits of their garden
project. After careful planning and hard work,
they applied for the grant. To their surprise,
they won! They received a lot of money from the government to help build
the garden. Sydney, Lauren, and they the rest of the students in the ecology

class began working on the garden. They used the money to buy the tools
they needed, and they built soil beds, planted different flowers, and watered
the garden. They also planted different vegetables and other plants that can
be used by different pollinators, like bees.


Everyone in their community loved the garden. They used it as a way to learn
about butterflies and other plants and animals. Sometimes they get to eat
the vegetables that grow in the garden and see how pollination works right
in front of their eyes. Today the garden continues to grow, and the butterflies
continue to thrive. Even the bees are having a
great time in the garden.

Buzzzzzz bzzzzz! Oh, I hear my honeybee
friend calling me. It’s time for us to flutter and
buzz around the garden together. Thank you
for all your help and hard work, and for being our butterfly ambassadors,
Sydney and Lauren!


It was very nice of our insect friends to tell us about these three very special
people—Mikaila, Sydney, and Lauren—who are all ambassadors for the
environment and are working hard to protect different plants and insects.
Just like Mikaila, Sydney, and Lauren, you too can be ambassadors. What is
something for which you would like to be an ambassador?


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** Why is Mikaila called an ambassador for the bees? _(Mikaila is an_
_ambassador for the bees because she works every day to help the honeybees_
_by educating others about the problems they face as she sells lemonade. She_
_also donates some of the money to foundations and groups that help protect_
_honeybees.)_


2. **Literal.** Why did Mikaila’s parents encourage her to research bees?
_(Mikaila’s parents believed that researching bees would help her cope with her_
_fear of bees. They believed that the more she understood bees, the less afraid_
_she would be of them.)_


3. **Literal.** What cause did Sydney and Lauren work toward? How did they
help? _(Sydney and Lauren worked to protect monarch butterflies by creating a_
_pollinator garden at their school. The garden will serve as a safe habitat for the_


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


_butterflies during their migration. Since their school is along the butterflies’_
_migration path, it will provide a place for them to rest and thrive.)_


4. **Inferential.** What qualities do you think Mikaila has that helped her be
successful? _(Answers may vary but could include that Mikaila is a very_
_creative, determined, and hard working young girl who was passionate about_
_saving bees. Instead of being afraid forever, she overcame her fears and_
_decided to do something to help bees instead of running away from them.)_


5. **Inferential.** How did Sydney and Lauren know that the garden would help
the butterflies? _(Sydney and Lauren learned about the life cycle of butterflies_
_at their ecology class. They also learned about butterflies’ habitats and_
_migration patterns. This knowledge helped them discover that having the_
_garden in their school, which is along the butterflies’ migration path, will help_
_protect the butterflies as they move.)_


6. **Inferential.** What is the purpose for reading this Read-Aloud? _(The purpose_
_is to learn how Mikaila, Sydney, and Lauren protected honeybees and monarch_
_butterflies.)_


7. **Evaluative.** Think-Pair-Share: Why is it important to protect insects such as
honeybees and butterflies? _(Answers may vary.)_


8. **Evaluative.** Think-Pair-Share: Compare and contrast Mikaila’s work for the
bees and Sydney and Lauren’s work for the butterflies. In what ways are they
similar? In what ways are they different? _(Answers may vary.)_


Lesson 14 Mikaila, Sydney, and Lauren: All About the Bees and Butterflies!
**213**


**214**



~~**WORD WORK: THRIVE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud, you heard the words, “For butterflies to thrive, we need
milkweed plants to help protect and feed our eggs and larvae.”


2. Say the word _thrive_ with me.


3. _Thrive_ means to grow or develop successfully.


4. The plants in the garden will thrive if taken care of well.


5. Have you ever seen something, someone, or somewhere thrive? Try to
use the word _thrive_ when you talk about it. [Ask two or three students. If
necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses: “I know thrives
because, or I have seen thrive because .”]


6. What is the word we have been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** What are some words that
are synonyms of _thrive_ or words that mean something similar? Turn to your
partner and think of some synonyms for the word _thrive_ . Create a sentence
for each of the synonyms your partner creates. [Prompt students to use the
words _grow_, _shine_, _develop_, _succeed_, and _do well_ . Then have them explain the
meaning of each synonym in the context of the sentence they created for it.
For example, ask, “What does the word succeed mean in the sentence ‘The
students will succeed if they study and work hard every day.’? How is that
sentence different from the sentence ‘The students will thrive if they study
and work hard every day.’?”]

##### Culminating Activities


~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


Please use these final two days to address class results of the Unit Assessment.
Based on the results of the Unit Assessment, you may wish to use this class time
to provide remediation opportunities that target specific areas of weakness for
individual students, small groups, or the whole class.


Alternatively, you may also choose to use this class time to extend or enrich
students’ experience with unit knowledge. A number of enrichment activities are
provided in order to provide students with opportunities to enliven their experiences
with unit concepts.


~~**REMEDIATION**~~


You may choose to regroup students according to particular areas of
weakness, as indicated by Unit Assessment results.


Remediation opportunities include:


  - targeting Review Activities


  - revisiting lesson Applications


  - rereading and discussing select Read-Alouds


Culminating Activities
**223**


**224**



~~**ENRICHMENT**~~


**Perspectives**

 - Have students choose a figure from the Read-Alouds they have heard.


 - Tell them that they are going to write two to three sentences about fighting
for a cause from that figure’s point of view or perspective. Explain that
perspective is how someone sees or experiences something.


 - Give students an example, such as, “If Rosa Parks were to talk about fighting
for a cause, she would probably use her experience in the Montgomery
Bus Boycott to do so.” or “If Cesar Chavez were to describe fighting for a
cause, he would probably use his experience as an organizer and leader for
farmworkers as an example.”


 - Give students time to write their sentences about fighting for a cause from
the perspective of the person they chose.


 - Then, allow students to share their writing with the class and to ask each
other questions pertaining to the figures they have chosen. Remember to
expand upon each student’s writing and response(s) using richer and more
complex language, including, if possible, any Read-Aloud vocabulary.


**You Were There: Voices of** _**Fighting for a Cause**_

 - Have students pretend that they were at one of the important events that led
to improvements so that everyone was treated equally under the law.


 - Ask students to describe what they saw and heard. For example, students
may talk about seeing all of the migrant workers walk from Delano to the
state capital in Sacramento as part of the nonviolent strike for farmworkers
to be given equal protection under the law regardless of their national origin.


 - Consider also extending this activity by adding group or independent writing
opportunities associated with the “You Were There” concept. For example,
ask students to pretend they are reporters describing a sit-in and write a
group news article describing the event.


Unit 10 Fighting for a Cause


**Class Book:** _**Fighting for a Cause**_


Materials: Drawing paper, drawing tools

  - Tell the class or a group of students that they are going to make a class book
to help them remember what they have learned in this unit.


  - Have students brainstorm important information about fighting for a cause
and the ordinary people who chose to take a stand for the betterment of
others.
