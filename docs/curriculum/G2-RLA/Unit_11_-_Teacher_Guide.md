#### Introduction


~~**FLIGHT AND THE STORY OF AVIATION**~~


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching the _Flight_

_and the Story of Aviation_ unit. The Teacher Guide for _Flight and the Story of Aviation_ contains fifteen

daily lessons, each of which is composed of two distinct parts so that the lesson may be divided into

smaller chunks of time and presented at different intervals during the day. Each entire lesson will

require a total of sixty minutes.


This unit includes a one day Pausing Point following Lesson 8. The activities in the Pausing Point are

included to allow time to review, reinforce, and remediate content knowledge.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


At the back of this Teacher Guide, you will find a section titled “Teacher Resources.” In this section you

will find the following:


  - “The Swing” by Robert Louis Stevenson


  - “The Poet and His Song” by Paul Laurence Dunbar


  - Activity Book Answer Key


  - Measures of Text Complexity


  - Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Correlation Chart


  - English Language Proficiency Standard Correlation Chart


~~**UNIT COMPONENTS**~~


Along with this Teacher Guide, you will need:


  - Activity Book for _Flight and the Story of Aviation_


  - Digital Components for _Flight and the Story of Aviation_


  - Flip Book for _Flight and the Story of Aviation_


  - Image Cards for _Flight and the Story of Aviation_


You will also need a single classroom copy of each of the following trade books, which are available at

 - You will also need access to the ReadWorks passage “Overcoming Barriers: Amelia Earhart.”


All unit components materials can also be found in the program’s online materials.


~~**WHY FLIGHT AND THE STORY OF AVIATION IS IMPORTANT**~~


Students will head up, up, and away with this introduction to the soaring history of aviation. Students

will learn the stories of early aviators, such as the Montgolfier brothers, the Wright brothers, Bessie

Coleman, and Amelia Earhart. They will study the science of flight, including the physics concept of lift,

and will research the social impacts of the world of flight. Finally, students will let their research skills

take flight as they explore key figures from the world of aviation. This unit will build on the previous

units about the early Greek civilizations and Greek myths in Grade 2, and will lay the foundation for

learning about other periods of world history in future grades.


The text that students will be reading and discussing provides opportunities for students to build content

knowledge and draw connections to science. You may build on class discussions to support students in

making cross-curriculuar connections to the strands of Recurring Themes and Concepts, Scientific and

Engineering Practices, and Matter and Its Properties. This is not a replacement for grade-level science

instruction. For more information about the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the

complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED**~~


The following unit, and the specific core content that was targeted in those units, are particularly

relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _Flight and the Story of Aviation_ . This background

knowledge will greatly enhance students’ understanding of the Read-Alouds they are about to enjoy:


Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government (Grade 2)


Stories of the Ancient Greeks (Grade 2)


Unit 11 Flight and the Story of Aviation


~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR FLIGHT AND THE STORY OF AVIATION**~~


The following list contains all the core vocabulary words in _Flight and the Story of Aviation_ in the forms in

which they appear in the Read-Alouds or, in some instances, in the “Introducing the Read-Aloud” section

at the beginning of the lesson. Boldfaced words in the list have an associated Word Work activity. The

inclusion of the words on this list does not mean that students are immediately expected to be able to use

all these words on their own. However, through repeated exposure throughout the lessons, they should

acquire a good understanding of most of these words and begin to use some of them in conversation.

~~**WRITING**~~


 - In this unit, students will plan, research, draft, and present informational texts to be displayed in
an Aviators Hall of Fame. Each lesson will build students’ understanding of the research process,
including brainstorming, asking questions, gathering information from texts, and writing about what
they have learned.


 - To show what they have learned, students will choose three aviators from the unit to write three
informational texts.


 - During this project, students will use the writing process to plan, draft, and edit their informational
texts. During the editing step, students will focus on editing drafts for prepositions and prepositional
phrases and using commas in a series and in dates.


 - It is recommended that students keep all materials relating to the research element in a folder for
easy access.


 - The technology applications Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills contain helpful guidance for

students who complete the writing piece on a computer.


Unit 11 Flight and the Story of Aviation


The following activities may be added to students’ writing portfolios to showcase student writing

within and across units:


  - Organizing information (Activity Page 2.2)


  - Creating questions (Activity Page 3.1)


  - Planning and conducting research (Activity Page 4.1)


  - Final drafts of Aviators Hall of Fame presentations (Activity Page 13.1)


  - By this point in the school year, students have learned to form all upper and lowercase letters in
cursive. Students are encouraged throughout this knowledge unit to use their cursive skills to
complete activity pages. Encourage them to produce their final informational text in cursive by using
the cursive they have been practicing in the skills lessons. A template for this project can be found on
Activity Book page 13.1. ~~**[ TEKS 2.2.E ]**~~

birds roosting in the top of a tree. You could

say hello to the window washer on the side of a





skyscraper or fly over the town water tower. You

could see whole towns stretched out below you,

just like looking at a map. ~~_If you had the power to_~~

~~_fly, what is the first thing you would do?_~~

Unit 11 Flight and the Story of Aviation


**Show Image 1A-2: Wings made of wax**

People have dreamed of flight for as long as we

have been around. Many **myths** and **legends**,

or imaginary stories people tell about the past,

feature people who learn to fly. In Greece, there

was the story of Daedalus [/day*dah*luss/].

Daedalus was an inventor who created a set



of wings to escape from a wicked king who had trapped him in a tower.

Daedalus created two sets of wings made of wax, one for himself and one

for his son Icarus [/ih*cah*russ/]. Daedalus escaped, but Icarus was not

so lucky. He flew too high, and the heat of the sun melted his wings. Even in

ancient times, people knew flying was not easy.


**Show Image 1A-3: All in the curve**

The myth of Daedalus shows us that people

knew birds’ wings had something to do with

flying. What they may not have known is why.

Birds fly because of something called **lift** . A





wing is shaped like a **curve** . ~~_The word_~~ ~~lift~~ ~~_means_~~

~~_a force that pushes something upward; a curve_~~

~~_is something that has a somewhat round shape._~~



Lift happens when air moves quickly over the curve of a bird’s wing, which

causes the air beneath the wing to push upward. It is easy for birds, because

they are born with wings.


**Show Image 1A-4: A Recipe for flying**

But it is not so easy for humans to create lift.

To understand how to create it, imagine that

you are a cook, and you want to make cookies.

You would need **ingredients**, ~~_or things that_~~





~~_are added together to make something else._~~

(In this case, butter, flour, eggs, and of course

chocolate chips.) And you would need a **recipe**,



~~_or a list of instructions for making food._~~ (In this case, mix them all together,

shape them into cookies, put them in the hot oven for about ten minutes,

and presto—cookies!) If you have both ingredients and a recipe, you can

make something. ~~_Do you think that is just true for cooking or for everything?_~~

Exactly, it is not just true for cooking, but for everything we can make. ~~_Have_~~

~~_you ever used a recipe to make something yummy to eat?_~~


Lesson 1 Up, Up, and Away!
**13**


Lift has a recipe too! And it has two ingredients. One is a wing with the right

shape and size. The shape and size of a wing **determines**, ~~_or controls,_~~ the

amount of lift you can create from it. (It is just the same as how the amount

of flour you have determines how many cookies you can make: if you just

have one cup of flour, you cannot make as many cookies as you could if you

had a whole pound of flour.) If the top of a wing has more curve than the

bottom of the wing, you can get lift. The larger the difference, the more lift

you can get. That is one ingredient. Can you guess the other ingredient?

Here is a hint: have you ever been out on a windy day with an umbrella and

seen the wind blow the umbrella up? That happens because the wind moving

over the umbrella is fast enough to create a lot of lift under it. And that is the

second ingredient of lift! The faster you can make air move over a wing, the

more lift you create.


So those are the two basic ingredients of lift. You need a properly curved

wing, and you need a way to move air over it quickly. Anyone who knew the

myth of Daedalus and watched birds flying understood a little bit of this. But

the trick was to find the right recipe to turn those two ingredients into wings

that worked. And no one understood that for a long time.


**Show Image 1A-5: Bamboo-copters**

One of the first working wings appeared in

China around the year 320 AD—over 1,700

years ago. And surprisingly, it was a toy! Here

is a bamboo helicopter, or a bamboo-copter.





It has two long blades attached to a stick.

When you twirl the stick of a bamboo-copter,



it moves air over the **blades** . Take a look at the shape of the blades. ~~_What do_~~

~~_you notice about them?_~~ It is the same shape as a bird’s wing! By twirling a

bamboo-copter, you are moving air over the blades, and you are creating lift.

It is not a huge amount of lift—just as much as your hands can create. But

the bamboo-copter is small, so it does not need much lift to send it soaring.

It is literally child’s play.


**Show Image 1A-6: The age of balloons**

But a bamboo-copter was not strong enough to

carry a person up into the air. Instead, people

tried other experiments. Maybe, they reasoned,

there was a way to fly without using wings at all.

Unit 11 Flight and the Story of Aviation


This man, Joseph Montgolfier [/mont*GOLF*ee*air/], was an inventor

who lived in France in the 1700s, about three hundred years after Leonardo

da Vinci. One day, while he was watching sparks and smoke drifting up

a fireplace, he **observed**, ~~_or noticed,_~~ that the sparks closest to the fire

were blowing upward from hot air. If the heat was making the sparks pull

themselves into the air, was there a way to pull other things into the air

too? Joseph kept trying his ideas in bigger and bigger ways, carefully

experimenting, until he and his brother hit on the idea of shaping sheets

into a cloth balloon and heating the air beneath it. They tested their theory

by building a massive cloth balloon. When they lit the burner to heat the

air, though, the balloon flew away without them! As they watched it slowly

disappear in the distance, the brothers knew they were onto something. The

brothers attached baskets strong enough to carry people to the bottom of

their balloons, and more and more people were flying every day. Soon, hot
air balloons filled the skies above France.


**Show Image 1A-7: Is lift enough?**

But balloons could only take you so high and

so far. Because of this, many serious inventors

kept trying to find wings that worked. As

they continued working on the problem for





years—in the end, over a hundred years after

the Montgolfiers— **technology**, ~~_or the kinds of_~~

~~_machines and tools people have to help solve_~~



~~_problems,_~~ kept getting better. ~~_Do you remember the recipe for lift?_~~ Faster air

and properly curved wings! As technology got better, people slowly realized

that they could probably make vehicles for flying, or **aircraft**, that would go

fast enough and be strong enough to fly. Inventors started building flying

machines that could go very high and very fast. But they ran into a problem.

~~_Can you guess what it was?_~~ Think back to Montgolfier’s hot-air balloon and

to the bamboo-copter. Both of them could fly, but both of them flew away.

That was fine when someone wasn’t riding in them. But people were starting

to realize that the problem wasn’t just creating lift. You also had to be able to

steer.


**Show Image 1A-8: The Wright answer at last**

Here are two brothers, Orville and Wilbur Wright.

They ran a bicycle shop in a place called Kitty

Hawk, in North Carolina, in the early 1900s. The

Wrights believed that they could make wings





Lesson 1 Up, Up, and Away!
**15**


that worked. But they also thought that other inventors were looking in the

wrong place. Lots of inventors thought that if they could just build an engine

that was powerful enough, they could make an aircraft go fast enough to

remain stable in the sky. But the Wright brothers decided not to worry about

speed. Their aircraft would use no motor at all, only wind. Just like a bird!


The Wright brothers kept studying birds, and they kept studying bicycles.

~~_Who knows how to make a turn on a bicycle? You turn the handlebars, but_~~

~~_do you do anything else?_~~ Exactly: you lean into the turn. By leaning into

the turn, you help the bike stay balanced. Orville and Wilbur noticed that

birds were leaning when they wanted to turn in the air. The Wright brothers

started to experiment with that idea. Soon they had built a **glider**, ~~_or a kind_~~

~~_of aircraft that flies without an engine,_~~ that had flexible wings. That let the

Wright brothers use instruments to carefully control how much lift was on

each wing. If a pilot turned the controls to move the left wing so that it had

more lift than the right wing, it would start to tilt the airplane upward to the

left, which would make the airplane turn. That meant that, even without an

engine, a pilot had control over an airplane. Airplanes today still use controls

based on the Wright brothers’ designs.


**Show Image 1A-9: Higher and higher**

We have learned a lot from birds, and people

use aircraft to fly all over the world. Jet engines

let us fly farther and faster than ever across

oceans, over mountains, and far above the





clouds. With rockets, we can even fly into space!

But we are still dreaming of flying higher. People

are still asking just how far and how high we can



**16**



go. It is the same question the Wright brothers asked, and the Montgolfiers,

and the children playing with bamboo-copters, and the unknown author of the

myth of Daedalus. All of us still dream of wings that work.


Unit 11 Flight and the Story of Aviation


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Inferential.** Why do you think people have always been interested in flying?
_(Answers may vary.)_


2. **Literal.** Why did Daedelus want to fly? _(He wanted to create wings so he_
_could escape from a tower.)_


3. **Literal.** Why are birds able to fly? _(They have wings, and, as air moves quickly_
_over the bird’s wings, it causes lift.)_


4. **Literal.** What is the recipe for lift? _(a curved wing and a way to move air_
_quickly over a wing)_


5. **Evaluative.** Think-Pair-Share: How have airplanes changed over time?
_(Answers may vary.)_


~~**WORD WORK: LIFT (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard the sentence, “Birds fly because of something
called lift.”


2. Say the word _lift_ with me.


3. _Lift_ in this sentence means a force that pushes upward.


4. Lift is the force that holds an airplane in the air.


5. Can you think of other things that use lift to fly?


6. What is the word we have been talking about?


**Use a Word to World activity for follow-up.** Ask students to discuss
how lift helps a paper airplane to fly. If feasible, have students construct
paper airplanes and take turns flying them in a controlled setting. Ask
them to observe and think about the factors that make some of the
airplanes fly farther, faster, or higher than others. Ask for volunteers to
share their thoughts.

**Reading:** Students will evaluate key details from the text and use evidence to
support understanding.

~~**TEKS 2.6.G**~~


~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED? (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students how the aviators they have learned about so far are similar.
_(They all have determination.)_ Ask students how the aviators are different.
_(They have invented different flying machines, and they are from different_
_places.)_


  - Ask, “What does it mean to have determination? ( _working to overcome_
_obstacles or challenges to achieve a goal)_ Can you tell me how Papa (Louis
Blériot) used determination to achieve his goal of flying across the English
Channel?” _(He continued to try, even when he was unsuccessful, and_
_eventually he was able to achieve his goal.)_


~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Say, “Today we are going to read a story about another aviator with a lot of
determination. He was from Brazil but lived in Paris, France.” Point out Brazil
and France on a map.


  - Ask, “Who else was from France that we have learned about?” _(the_
_Montgolfier brothers, Louis Blériot)_

Lesson 5 The Race Is On
**57**


**Show Image 5A-1: A young Santos-Dumont**
**bound for Paris**

Alberto Santos-Dumont could have done

anything he wanted. His parents owned a

giant plantation in Brazil. They sent coffee

beans all over the world, and this business had

made them, and their son Alberto, very rich. It

would have been simple for the young Santos


Dumont to take it easy and enjoy his family’s money for the rest of his life.


But Santos-Dumont didn’t want to do that. He knew that he had been very

lucky, and he also knew that it was only fair to give something back. He

wanted to do something other than run a coffee plantation, something that

would help many people. But what should that be? He didn’t know yet. But

he guessed that by leaving his home in Brazil for Paris, an exciting city full of

culture and new inventions, he might start to find the answer for himself.


**Show Image 5A-2: Santos-Dumont in a**
**spherical balloon**

In Paris, Santos-Dumont studied many

subjects and sought out many adventures. In

the year 1897, when he was twenty-four years





old, he decided to take a balloon ride.


On the day of the flight, Santos-Dumont sat



**58**



in the basket of a giant **spherical** balloon more than five times his height.

His guide **inflated** the balloon, and it grew larger and larger as it filled with

lighter-than-air gas. Then, suddenly, Santos-Dumont and his guide were

rising into the sky!


The flight was smooth and almost silent. From where Santos-Dumont was

standing in the basket, it looked like the earth was dropping away beneath

his feet. He and his guide ate a delicious lunch above the clouds, and ice

dusted the ropes and the edges of the basket. When he landed, Santos
Dumont knew what he wanted his dream to be. He would use his **wealth** to

become a great aviator himself.


Unit 11 Flight and the Story of Aviation


**Show Image 5A-3: Santos-Dumont flying the**
**Brazil**

Santos-Dumont had soon built his own

balloon. When you make your own balloon, you

of course get to choose what to name it!

Santos-Dumont thought long and hard about

this choice. In honor of his homeland, Santos
Dumont named his balloon _Brazil_ .


**Show Image 5A-4: Santos-Dumont in his**
**Number 6 dirigible**

The _Brazil_ was only the beginning. Santos
Dumont kept building balloons, each more

complicated than the last. He moved on

from spherical balloons, which could only

really go where the wind decided to carry

them. His next balloons were dirigibles




[/dee*ruh*juh*bl/], from the French word that meant “to steer”, which

means they were aircraft without wings. Now he could fly his balloons

wherever he wanted.


Santos-Dumont was as natural as a bird at flying. He began to enter races

and competitions to show off his skill and ingenuity. He entered one balloon,

named _Number 6_, in a race to circle the Eiffel Tower and return to the

starting line in less than thirty minutes. Santos-Dumont won the race, which

earned him a huge cash prize. But he was rich, he thought. What did he need

with more money? He gave away the prize to his mechanics and to the poor

of Paris. After that, the people all knew his name, and they loved him.


**Show Image 5A-5: Santos-Dumont in his airship**

Santos-Dumont loved being famous. He

especially loved showing people that flying

could be a part of everyday life. One of his

favorite things to do was to fly one of his





airships to his favorite restaurant to have

dinner. He would soar down the streets of



Paris, wearing a wide-brimmed hat that he would tip to the people below him

as he passed. On arriving at the restaurant, he would drop a guide rope and

**descend** from the basket of his dirigible on a ladder. He would tie the rope


Lesson 5 The Race Is On
**59**


to a lamppost and go in to eat his dinner while the giant balloon floated just

outside the windows.


Behind this **confidence**, there was a dream. When he had flown in his first

balloon, he noticed how small and peaceful people looked from up high. If

everyone could fly like he had, everyone would become more thoughtful and

appreciative of one another. Flying could change the world, he thought. So he

would continue to explore ways to make flying safer and easier for everyone.


**Show Image 5A-6: Santos-Dumont in 1906**

Other people were working to solve the

problem of flight, of course! Across the ocean

in the United States, the Wright brothers

reported in December 1903 that they had





successfully flown in something called an

airplane. Inspired, Santos-Dumont set

dirigibles aside and threw himself into building



his own fixed-wing planes with motors. He made his first successful powered

flight in his plane _No. 14-bis_ before cheering crowds in 1906. He was the first

person since the Wrights to succeed in building and flying a plane.


**Show Image 5A-7: Santos-Dumont’s**
**Desmoiselle**

Then, in 1909, he improved on the Wrights by

creating one of the world’s first single-wing

planes, the _Desmoiselle_ . If he sold his new





design to manufacturers, he knew that he

could earn a lot of money. But Santos-Dumont

again thought about his luck. He had been so



**60**



rich that he never had to worry about an ordinary job. He had been free to

pursue his dream. It was time at last, he knew, to give something back.


Santos-Dumont gave away the plans to the _Desmoiselle_ by publishing them

in the magazine _Popular Mechanics_ . Anyone who wanted to start building

their own planes could use Santos-Dumont’s discovery as a guide, absolutely

free. It was an amazing gift. But sometimes when we give a gift away, we

get a greater gift back. ~~_[Ask, “What do you think that means?”]_~~ By giving

his plane designs away, Santos-Dumont knew he was inspiring the world to

dream of flying, just as the aviator who had agreed to take Santos-Dumont

on his first balloon flight in 1897 had once inspired him. He was helping to


Unit 11 Flight and the Story of Aviation


build the peaceful world he had always wanted, where everyone could fly.

Smiling to think of it, he again tipped his hat. ~~_[Ask, “Do you think Santos-_~~

~~_Dumont’s dream will ever come true?]_~~


 - Allow a few students to share their understanding of key details in the
text, using the anchor chart sentence frame you have prepared: When
happened, it was a key detail, because...


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What kind of transportation did Alberto Santos-Dumont use to get
around? _(a dirigible or balloon)_


2. **Evaluative.** Why didn’t Alberto want to stay and manage his family’s plantation
in Brazil? _(He wanted to try to contribute something that would help people.)_


3. **Literal.** How was a dirigible different from a balloon? _(Dirigibles were not_
_shaped like a sphere and could be steered.)_


4. **Literal.** How did Alberto improve the Wright brothers’ design? _(He Invented_
_the one-wing airplane.)_


5. **Inferential.** Why do you think Alberto wanted to help others? _(He had_
_experienced good luck his entire life and wanted to help others who were not_
_as lucky as him.)_


~~**WORD WORK: SPHERICAL (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the story, you heard the sentence “On the day of the flight, Santos-Dumont sat
in the basket of a giant spherical balloon more than five times his height.”


2. Say _spherical_ with me.


3. _Spherical_ means it is shaped like a sphere.


4. A hot air balloon is spherical because it is spherical in shape.


5. Can you think of why a balloon could fly better if it is spherical in shape?


6. What is the word we have been talking about?


**Use a Draw It, Describe It activity for follow-up.** Ask students to think
of something that is spherical and make a drawing of it. Then have them
describe their picture with a sentence that has the word _spherical_ in it.

people think Alberto
Santos-Dumont made
the world’s first powered
flight and not the Wright
brothers.

Unit 11 Flight and the Story of Aviation


But flying in the 1920s was not like today. Airplanes were still very new

and very dangerous. There were few pilots—less than 300 pilots were in

the entire U.S. Army Air Corps. There were few flight schools, and at the

beginning of the 1920s, those flight schools that were open in the U.S. did

not yet admit women.


But Bessie dreamed of becoming a pilot even if people thought it would be

impossible.


**Show Image 6A-6: France**

Bessie applied to every American flight school,

but they all turned her down. Her friend, a

newspaper publisher, encouraged her to move

to France so that she could learn how to fly.

Bessie decided to take that advice. Because she was applying to a French

flight school, her application had to be written in French, not English. But

that didn’t stop Bessie! She decided to learn French and took classes at

night. Eventually, she mastered the French language and submitted her

Bessie was accepted into the Caudron

Brothers’ School of Aviation in France. This

meant she had to move from the United

States to France. Every day, she walked nine





miles to and from school. ~~_[Guide students to_~~

**Show Image 6A-8: Coleman and her plane**

After earning her pilot’s license, Bessie moved

back to the United States. Bessie started traveling

around the United States, performing great flying

stunts and giving speeches. Bessie was one of the

top “barnstorming” pilots in the U.S.


Barnstorming was incredibly popular in the



early 1920s, during what became known as the golden age of aviation. ~~_What_~~

~~_is a golden age?_~~ Events in towns all over America were being scheduled

on fields, farms, and outside of towns. There were almost no airports, so a

barnstorming event could be scheduled anywhere there was flat open space.

Barnstormer pilots would come to the events in their planes, at a time when

most Americans had never seen a plane. Barnstormers would perform daring

tricks in the air, sometimes recreating dog fights from World War I. ~~_Dog fights_~~

~~_are when planes fly very close together and take turns climbing, turning,_~~

~~_and rolling._~~ And there were tremendous speed races, as planes and pilots

continued to get more advanced. It was an amazing spectacle. ~~_One famous_~~

~~_pilot who got his start as a barnstormer was Charles Lindbergh. Another_~~

~~_was Amelia Earhart._~~ But Bessie Coleman was perhaps the most daring

barnstormer of them all.


Bessie’s most famous move was a “loop-the-loop” maneuver, where the plane

would make a vertical circle in the air. This was at a time when almost no

planes were designed to do that—the cockpits were sometimes completely

open! But Bessie didn’t stop there; she also did barrel rolls, figure-eights, and

other tricks in the skies, to the delight of the people below. ~~[~~ ~~_Use a model_~~

~~_airplane to illustrate the tricks that Bessie did in her plane._~~ ~~]~~ In one of her most

daring tricks, Bessie would hand over the controls to her co-pilot, walk out

onto the wing of her plane as it was in flight, and parachute into the crowd

below! Bessie’s daredevil maneuvers and stunning courage earned her the

nicknames “Queen Bess” and “Brave Bessie” from adoring crowds across the

country. ~~_Do you have a nickname?_~~ ~~[Pause for students’ responses.]~~


**Show Image 6A-9: Airshow**

As Bessie’s fame grew, she continued to travel

the country and give both flight lessons and

flight shows. She encouraged others to learn

how to fly just like she did. In 1923, Bessie had





her first real brush with danger. Her plane’s

engine stopped working in the middle of one


Unit 11 Flight and the Story of Aviation


of her flights and crashed down to the ground. Although she was badly hurt,

Bessie recovered, and soon, she was back soaring the skies in her airplane.


**Show Image 6A-10: Jenny JN-4**

Bessie was able to earn enough money to

purchase her own plane, “Jenny,” the JN-4.

She returned to her hometown in Texas and

continued to perform and use her fame and

influence to fight for equality. But flying at

the time was still very dangerous —even

The word _fatal_ means
causing death.





more so when you consider the tricks Bessie

performed. Unfortunately, Bessie was fatally



injured in a plane crash in 1926. Bessie’s hard work and determination left

a lasting legacy. At her funeral, Ida B. Wells, a famous African American

civil rights leader, gave a speech about Bessie’s life as a trailblazer. Aviation

organizations honored her in many ways including a “flyover” where flowers

were dropped on her gravesite. ~~_A trailblazer is someone who is a pioneer or_~~

~~_an innovator. What does it mean to “fly over” something? [Pause for students’_~~

~~_responses.]_~~


Soon after her death, the “Bessie Coleman Aero Club” was organized in her

honor. The club promoted Bessie’s dream of expanding access to aviation for all.


**Show Image 6A-11: Bessie Coleman quarter**

In 1995, the United States Postal Service

released a postage stamp in Bessie’s honor.

And there’s even a quarter with Bessie

Coleman on it. ~~_[Show students a Bessie_~~

~~_Coleman stamp, quarter, or both, if possible.]_~~





This highlights the significant contributions

she made to both aviation and the country as



a whole. Bessie has also had numerous schools, streets, airports, memorials,

and more named after her throughout the country. Her life reminds us that

everyone in our great nation can achieve their dreams through hard work and

determination.

~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** Where did Bessie have to go to learn how to fly?


» Bessie was accepted into the Caudron Brothers’ School of Aviation in France.


2. **Inferential.** In the text, Bessie’s determination and influence in aviation in
America made a huge impact. What type of impact is the story referring to?


» Bessie overcame hardship to pursue her dream of becoming a pilot. She

became a pioneer in the field of aviation and opened the doors for other African

Americans and women to pursue their dreams.


3. **Evaluative.** Why did people in the 1920s enjoy going to barnstorming events?


» Answers may vary but could include that airplanes were new, and they were

curious to see something new. They enjoyed watching daring feats of courage.


4. **Literal.** What challenges did Bessie have to overcome in order to become a pilot?


» Answers may vary but could include that she had to help her mom at home

with her twelve siblings, she had to pay for college, she had to earn enough

money for flight school, she applied and was turned down at every flight school

in the United States, she had to learn to speak French and move to France, she

had to walk nine miles to the flight school each day, and she had to go to flight

school for two years.


5. **Literal.** What were some of the maneuvers Bessie performed?


» She was a barnstorming pilot. She performed loop-the-loops, barrel rolls, and

figure eights. She would walk out on the wing and parachute down.


~~**WORD WORK: ENTHRALLED  (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the story, you heard the sentence, “Bessie was enthralled by her brothers’
stories and adventures.”


2. Say _enthralled_ with me.


3. _Enthralled_ means “to capture the fascinated attention.”


4. Bessie’s brothers had captured her attention with their flying stories, which
fascinated her. Let’s look at some clues or hints the author wrote in the text
to determine the meaning of this word.


5. Explain a time when you were being told a story and became enthralled.

to/different from other planes they have learned about. Explain to
students that the plane was named the Spirit of St. Louis after a group of
businessmen who financed, or paid for, Lindbergh’s flight.


    - On page 5, ask students to make a prediction about whether or not they
think the plane will be able to make its journey. Ask students to share
reasons why or why not. _(Answers may include that it took three tries_
_before the plane would stay in the air or that the plane barely makes it over_
_the telephone wire at the end of the field.)_ Display or project the Lindbergh

   - Pause after reading page 10. Ask students how they think Lindbergh
is feeling at this point in his flight. Then, model making, revising, and
confirming predictions. Think aloud, “When I read the summary at the back
of the book, I was sure that Charles Lindbergh made the flight to Paris. So
far, my prediction is correct. From what we have read so far, Lindbergh has
made it to Newfoundland.” Put a checkmark in the box beside Newfoundland
on the Lindbergh Flight Map (Digital Components) to show where Lindbergh
is on his flight path.


   - Reread the sentences, “Now he can no longer follow the land’s edge for
direction. He must chart his course carefully. The slightest movement
could send him miles off course and risk the fuel supply.” Ask students to
predict what they think will happen during the next period of Lindbergh’s
flight. Tell students that you will continue reading so that they can confirm
or revise their predictions.


   - Pause after reading page 19, and ask students whether their predictions
were correct. Put a checkmark in the box beside Ireland on the Lindbergh
Flight Map (Digital Components) to show where Lindbergh is on his flight
path.


   - Pause after reading page 24, and ask students to predict how people in
Paris and the United States will react once they realize that Lindbergh has
successfully completed his flight. Put a checkmark next to Paris on the
Lindbergh Flight Map (Digital Components) to show that Lindbergh has
successfully completed the flight.


   - As you continue reading, encourage students to make, revise, and confirm
their predictions.


   - After reading, discuss with students how making predictions about what
will happen in the story keeps the reader involved in the reading process
and helps the reader understand and remember what was read.

Unit 11 Flight and the Story of Aviation


**Multiple-Meaning Words Activity**


**Materials:** Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard, Flip Book Posters 1M-3M


  - Throughout Lessons 1-8, you have heard several multiple-meaning words. For
this activity, we will use the words _glider_, _pitch_, _inflated_, and _parachute_ .


  - Review with students that multiple-meaning words are exactly what they
sound like. They are words that have several different definitions. Tell
students that many times the definition of these words depend on how the
word is used in a sentence. For example, if the word is used as a noun, it
might have a different definition than if the word was used as a verb.


  - For this activity, display Flip Book Posters 1M-3M, one at a time. Ask students
to look at each image on the poster and to read the definitions at the bottom.
Then, share a sentence with students and have them determine which
meaning of the word is being used.


  - You may wish to have students create sentences using these words and
identifying the meaning and part of speech that has been used.


**Poetry Activity**

  - Additional activities for “The Swing” by Robert Louis Stevenson and “The
Poet and His Song” by Paul Laurence Dunbar can be found in the program’s
online materials. The poems themselves can be found in the Teacher
Resources section of this Teacher Guide.


**Research Activity**


**Materials:** Trade books, Flip Book images, locally approved sources


  - Review with students what they have already learned about the history of
aviation. Remind students that aviation has come a long way since the first
inventions they have learned about in this unit. Ask students to think about
how these early inventions (hot air balloons, dirigibles, single-wing planes,
etc.) have influenced modern aviation.


  - If students have further questions about any of the inventions they have read
about, you may want to provide students with an opportunity to do research.
Have students research to find out how modern airplanes, helicopters, hot air
balloons, etc. work and how they are still influenced by these early inventions.
Ensure that all research is continuously monitored.


  - You may do this research as a class or have students do their research individually.
Encourage students to present their findings to a group of students or to the class.


  - Make sure to reinforce unit-specific vocabulary whenever possible as
students conduct their research.

~~**MAKING CONNECTIONS (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 2.2 in their Activity Book.



**108**




  - Discuss with students what they have already learned about the topic
of the unit.


  - Have students refer to Activity Page 2.2. Ask students how the stories they
have read so far are related. Talk about the different types of flying machines
mentioned in the stories.


  - Display the front cover of today’s Read-Aloud and read the title.


  - Ask students for ideas of what this story may be about.


  - Model making a connection to previous Read-Alouds. Think aloud, “The cover
and title of this book remind me of the story we read during the first lesson
about the bamboo-copter. I wonder whether this story will be about the
invention of the helicopter.”


  - Turn to the table of contents. Remind students that the table of contents
gives an overview of what the story is about. After reading the table of
contents, model it as a way to make connections to previous stories.


  - Say, “In the Read-Aloud from Lesson 1, we learned that airplanes need
properly curved wings to fly. I see one of the chapters is called ‘Flying Without
Wings.’ I know helicopters do not have wings. I wonder whether this chapter
will explain how helicopters fly.”


**TEKS 2.6.E** Make connections to personal experiences, ideas in other texts, and society.


Unit 11 Flight and the Story of Aviation


~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that Igor Sikorsky was an engineer (a person who designs
systems or structures to solve problems) and an inventor who immigrated to
America from Ukraine. Point out Ukraine on a map. Note: Ukraine and Russia
were at one point part of the same country, the Soviet Union, and before that,
the Russian Empire.


 - Explain that, just like the other aviators we have read about, Igor was determined
to invent the helicopter even if it meant revising his plans many times.


 - Tell students that you will read the story and see whether Igor achieves his goal.

   - Ask students, “What characteristic does Igor share with the other aviators
you have learned about?” _(determination)_


   - On page 11, explain that _stalled_ is when something stops working or
running, such as an engine. Ask, “What caused Igor’s engine to stall?”
_(a mosquito in the fuel line)_


   - On page 16, explain that _invest_ means to give someone money to do or
make something in the hope of making a profit. Ask, “What did Igor do with
the money?” _(He made airplanes.)_

~~**READ-ALOUD: “TUSKEGEE AIRMEN” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 10A-1: B-17**

It was March 24, 1945, during World War II.

The 332nd Fighter Group of the US Army Air

Corps, known as the Tuskegee Airmen, were

flying into combat. They were flying an **escort**





mission, flying alongside other planes to

protect them from attack. They were escorting

heavy bombers, B-17s, large airplanes that



were designed to fly long distances and drop bombs on the enemy. But those

heavy bombers were slow and **vulnerable**, and if enemy fighter planes were

in the area, the enemy fighters could easily shoot down the bombers before

they were able to hit their targets ~~_Ask: “Why would it be important to have_~~ .

~~_fighter planes escort the heavy bombers?” (Answers should include: without_~~

~~_fighter escorts, the bombers would be easily shot down by enemy fights,_~~

~~_because the bombers were slow.)_~~


The American pilots were deep into Nazi German territory. The mission was

to get those giant B-17’s to bomb a tank assembly plant near Berlin, and then

get back home safely. It was the only way America was going to win the war

and defeat the evil Nazis. But it was dangerous. The **mission** involved flying

1,600 miles from Italy to Germany and back. The entire time they were over

Germany, heavy anti-aircraft guns fired from below. German fighter planes

would do everything they could to shoot down the American bombers.


**TEKS 2.10.A** Discuss the author’s purpose for writing text; **TEKS 2.3.B** Use context within and beyond a sentence to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words.


Unit 11 Flight and the Story of Aviation


Check for Understanding


What countries were fighting against each other in World War II? (Answers
should include America and the Allies, including England/Great Britain
on one side, vs. Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Axis, on the other.) What
country were the Tuskegee Airmen part of? (America)


**Show Image 10A-2: Red Tail Plane**

But on this day, for this dangerous mission, the

Tuskegee Airmen were flying. They were flying

fighter planes, alongside the bombers. Their planes

were P-51 Mustangs, painted with red tails, so that

everyone would know it was them. They were the





best of the best. Throughout the war, almost no

bombers ever got shot down when the Tuskegee



Airmen escorted them. Enemy German pilots knew just how good they were, calling

them _Schwarze Vogelmenschen_, or “Black Birdmen,” as a term of respect. Their

commanding officer, Lt. Colonel Benjamin Davis, Jr., named his plane “By Request”

because so many American bomber pilots requested the Tuskegee Airmen to escort

them. ~~Why would so many American bomber pilots request to be escorted by the~~

~~Tuskegee Airman?~~ ~~_(Because when Tuskegee Airmen escorted American bombers,_~~

~~_the bombers almost never got shot down, so the bomber pilots knew they were safer;_~~

~~_emphasize the new vocabulary word, they were less_~~ ~~_**vulnerable**_~~ ~~_.)_~~


This day would test them like never before. The B-17 bombers and P-51 Mustang

fighter planes were planes from the first generation of aviation. They were powered

by propellers. They were certainly powerful for their time — the P-51s could fly at a

top speed of 440 miles per hour. But propeller planes are slower than jet aircraft.

Unfortunately, Nazi Germany had invented jet aircraft before the Americans.


**Show Image 10A-3: Jet Engine**

The Germans flew a jet called the Me-262. It

wasn’t powered by a propeller. It used a jet engine.

There are big differences. A propeller cuts through

open air. It generates thrust by the curve of the





propeller blades pushing the open air backward.

In contrast, a jet engine compresses air, shooting



it out a small opening in the back at high speed. Jet engines can help aircraft go

much faster, and the Germans had figured out how to make them. The Me-262

jets could fly at a top speed of 540 miles per hour, so much faster than the P-51s it

would make it seem like the American planes were standing still.


Lesson 10 Heroes
**121**


Check for Understanding


Earlier in this unit, we read about who invented the first airplane. Who
invented the first airplane? (The Wright Brothers) Did they invent a
propeller plane or a jet airplane? _(propeller plane)_ Show Image Card 1, and
note the propeller in the image. Are jets a little bit faster than propeller
planes or a lot faster than propeller planes? _(Jets are a lot faster.)_


To make matters worse, the Red Tails had been flying a very long mission

already and were supposed to be relieved by other fighter planes with more

fuel. But the relief planes never showed up. For these men, though, failure

was never an option. Tuskegee Airmen were brave. They refused to turn back.

Instead, they would stay with the B-17s all the way to the target, even if they

ran out of fuel and had to crash land before they got back.


**Show Image 10A-4: The Tuskegee Airmen**

The Tuskegee Airman weren’t just brave. They

were incredibly skilled. They had gone through

intense training, years before back in America.

During flight school, there were hard classes,





requiring constant study. If they failed too

many tests, they were kicked out of the



**122**



program. And then there was the flight training itself. During flight training,

two men would go into the plane: the cadet, the person who was training to

be a pilot, and the instructor, the person doing the teaching. The cadet had

to do exactly what the instructor ordered. They would fly up 10,000 feet,

perform loops, do slow rolls, dive, and many other skills. Throughout the

training flights, the instructor would take note of any errors, no matter how

small. If a cadet made too many errors on a flight, the cadet got a pink slip.

Three pink slips, and the cadet was dropped from the flight program. The

first class began with thirteen cadets, but only five earned their wings,

officially becoming pilots. The Tuskegee Airmen were only the best. ~~Why do~~

~~you think their training was so strict?~~ ~~_(Answers may vary but should include_~~

~~_that the training had to be strict to ensure they would be successful in_~~

~~you would be more prepared later in life?~~ ~~_(Answers may vary.)_~~


Unit 11 Flight and the Story of Aviation


**Show Image 10A-5: Me-262**

On that day in 1945, as the American bombers and

fighters approached the tank factory near Berlin,

several German Me-262 jet fighters showed up.

There was an intense dogfight. The pilots looped.

They swooped. They climbed. They dived. The

American P-51s were clearly slower than the

German Me-262s, but inside those P-51s weren’t



just any pilots. They were Tuskegee Airmen. Before long, the Red Tails shot down

three German jets, even though the Americans had slower planes. As a result, the

bombers all made it to their targets successfully and turned around for the long

flight back to Italy. ~~What does successfully mean?~~ ~~_(to end well, the mission worked,_~~

~~_it achieved its objectives)_~~


Even then, the day wasn’t over. The American fighters barely had enough

fuel for the trip. If they ran out of fuel before they got back to the airfield in

Italy, the pilots would have to crash land. Tuskegee Airmen were used to this

problem. In fact, the competitive pilots would brag about who had the least

amount of fuel when they landed. They formed the “Three Minute Egg Club” for

those pilots who landed with less than three minutes of fuel remaining. These

men were used to close calls ~~. If they only had three minutes of fuel remaining~~

~~when they landed, what would happen if their mission took 4 minutes longer?~~

~~_(They would run out of fuel while flying, and would have to crash land.)_~~


Over the course of the war, the Tuskegee Airmen flew over 1,500 combat

missions. They destroyed over a hundred enemy aircraft in dogfights and

hundreds more on the ground. They also helped destroy nearly a thousand

rail cars and vehicles, which made it harder for Germany to move equipment.

Throughout all of this, the Tuskegee Airmen suffered only minimal losses.

This made them one of the best fighting forces in the war.


**Show Image 10A-6: Tuskegee Army Airfield**

But all of this bravery and skill in combat almost

never happened. At this time in America, there

were many laws throughout the country that

enforced racial segregation, unlike today. Before





World War II, African Americans were not allowed to

be pilots in the Army. But there were many people



in the Army and in America that disagreed with these laws. As World War II began,

laws were passed to allow the highly respected Tuskegee Institute, a college for

African Americans, to establish a flight school in Tuskegee, Alabama. From here, the

Tuskegee Airmen were trained,and eventually, sent into battle to serve their country.

~~_Point to Tuskegee, Alabama on a map._~~


Lesson 10 Heroes
**123**


**Show Image 10A-7: President Truman**
**desegregated the military**

Their excellent performance in World War II

helped win the war, but it also helped change

America. The Tuskegee Airmen inspired

President Truman to issue an executive order

after the war prohibiting segregation and

discrimination in the military. In Executive



**124**



Order number 9981, Truman wrote: “It is hereby declared to be the policy

of the President that there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity

for all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, religion

or national origin.” Now all Americans could serve their country together,

regardless of race. It became an important change that helped lead to the

Civil Rights Movement.


After World War II ended, the Tuskegee Airmen continued to grow in size and

popularity. They once again served with honor during the Korean War in the

early 1950s. When the war ended, many of the Tuskegee Airmen came home

and continued to serve their country and communities in other ways, like

becoming doctors, lawyers, and other professionals in civilian life.


The Tuskegee Airmen volunteered to fight for our country and made huge

sacrifices for America. They became one of the greatest fighter groups in

U.S. history. They showed us that in our country, no matter our background,

with determination and hard work, we can do whatever we set our minds to.


Check for Understanding


Is this a true story? (yes) We learned about segregation in the previous
unit: _Fighting for a Cause_ . What is segregation? _(a practice under law of_
_keeping people separate because of their race)_ When was segregation
ended in the U.S. military? _(President Truman issued an order prohibiting it_
_after the end of World War II.)_


Unit 11 Flight and the Story of Aviation


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What war did the Tuskegee Airmen serve in? _(World War II)_


2. **Literal.** How did the Tuskegee Airmen prepare to become successful pilots?
_(Answers may vary but should come from the text and include the fact_
_that they trained very hard during flight school, and if they made too many_
_mistakes flying or failed too many tests, they weren’t allowed to be pilots.)_


3. **Inferential.** Think-Pair-Share. Why are jet engine airplanes faster than
propeller airplanes? _(Answers may vary but should include that jet engines_
_compress air through a small opening, and because of that, the air moves_
_much faster than a propeller, which pushes open air.)_


4. **Evaluative.** Think-Pair-Share. What purpose did the author have in writing
this informational text? _(Answers may vary but should include that the author_
_wanted to persuade the reader that the Tuskegee Airmen were very good_
_pilots, very important to the American victory in World War II, and important in_
_ending segregation in the United States military.)_


~~**WORD WORK: VULNERABLE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the story, you heard the sentence, “But those heavy bombers were slow and
vulnerable, and if enemy fighter planes were in the area, the enemy fighters could
easily shoot down the bombers before they were able to hit their targets.”


2. Say _vulnerable_ with me.


3. When someone or something is vulnerable, it is weak or without protection.


4. The group was vulnerable during the thunderstorm because they did not
have an umbrella.


5. Think of a time a person or animal might be _vulnerable_ . Share your thoughts
with a partner.


6. What is the word we have been talking about?



Challenge


For question #3, students
can reproduce this effect
to understand the physics
involved. The teacher
would model for the
students to reproduce.


Take your hands and put
them in front of your
mouth, with your mouth
wide open, and breath out
on your hands as if you
are trying to warm them.
Feel how much force hits
your hands. This is similar
to propellers pushing
open air. Then, try again,
but this time purse your
lips and breathe out. You
can feel how much faster
your breath hits your
hands when the opening
is narrower, just like the
jet out of the back of a jet
engine.

#### Introducing the Read-Aloud



10M



**Reading:** Students will ask and answer questions about key details in the text.

~~**TEKS 2.1.A**~~


~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED? (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Say, “We have been reading lots of stories in the past week. What are some of
the stories we have read?”


  - Direct students to Activity Page 2.2. Ask them to review the questions they
have recorded and to think whether any of the questions have been answered
from the stories that they have read so far. Explain that one way in which we
can find answers to our questions is to look for them in books. Tell them that
books are a type of resource.


  - Ask two or three volunteers to share any questions that may have been answered.


  - Ask, “What characteristic do all the aviators share in those stories?”
_(determination)_


  - Explain that all the aviators they have read about so far have something in
common besides determination. Ask if they can think of what it is. _(Guide_
_students to realize that all aviators must be passionate about learning new_
_information and be willing to take risks.)_ Ask students to turn and talk to a
partner about what might be required of someone who wants to become an
aviator. Ask volunteers to share some of their thoughts with the class.


~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that today they are going to read a story about a woman named
Beatrice Shilling. She was from England. Point out the place on a map.


  - Explain that, like all the other aviators we have learned about, she has a lot
of determination. However, she is not an aviator. She was an engineer who
worked on airplane engines.


  - Explain that, like the Tuskegee Airmen, Beatrice played a big role in helping
the Allies win in World War II.


  - Tell students that as today’s story is read, they should think about questions
they would want to ask Beatrice.


**TEKS 2.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and answer questions using multi-word responses.

  - Project Activity Page 3.1, and remind students to think about questions they
can create using the question words on the activity page.


~~**THE GIRL WHO COULD FIX ANYTHING:**~~

~~**BEATRICE SHILLING, WORLD WAR II ENGINEER (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Read aloud _The Girl Who Could Fix Anything: Beatrice Shilling, World War II_
_Engineer_ by Mara Rockliff. As you read, incorporate the following information
and guided reading supports:


    - On page 5, explain that an _engineer_ is a person who designs, builds, and
maintains machines. Beatrice was going to be an apprentice engineer.
Explain that an _apprentice_ is a person who is learning to do a job by
working alongside someone else who is skilled at that job.

    - On page 9, explain that the word _tinkered_ means trying to repair or
improve something by playing around with it. Beatrice tinkered with her
motorcycle in her spare time. Ask, “Why do you think she tinkered with her
motorcycle?”

    - After reading page 11, ask, “How did the author organize this story?” _(It_
_is told in chronological order.)_ Point out the phrase, “By the time Beatrice
left the University.” Tell students that authors use clue words and phrases
that let us know that time is passing in the story. Ask, “What did Beatrice
do before she went to University?” _(She met Miss Partridge and was an_
_apprentice engineer.)_

    - Pause after reading page 19. Ask: “What word or phrase on this page tells us
that the story is being told chronologically or in “time order”? _(the next year)_


**TEKS 2.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and answer questions using multi-word responses;
**TEKS 2.10.B** Discuss how the use of text structure contributes to the author’s purpose.


Unit 11 Flight and the Story of Aviation


   - Pause after reading page 20, and ask students to use any of the key details
in the text to create questions. If students need additional help creating
questions, model several examples. _(What is the problem nobody can solve?_
_Who will solve the problem?)_ Ask two or three volunteers to share their
questions. Write these examples on the class copy of Activity Page 3.1.

   - After reading the second paragraph on page 21, review the meaning of
_sputter_ from Lesson 4 about Louis Bleriot’s airplane. Point out the words
“put, put, put” in the illustration on page 22. Explain that this is the sound
the engine made when it sputtered out.

   - At the end of page 21, explain that _fuel_ is a substance that is burned to
create energy to power something such as an airplane. The type of fuel
burned by planes is gasoline.

   - After reading, ask students to think of questions for each of the remaining
question words on Activity Page 3.1.


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What did Beatrice like to do with tools? _(make things, fix things, and_
_take things apart)_


2. **Literal.** What happened to British aircraft engines when British planes had to
dive suddenly? _(They would sputter and sometimes stop completely.)_


3. **Inferential.** The book said that when this problem started occurring, the
source of the trouble seemed clear: not enough fuel was getting to the
engine. Why would not enough fuel getting to the engine seem like the
obvious cause of this problem? _(Answers may vary but may include that_
_engines need gasoline to work, and without them, they sputter.)_
**Follow Up:** Even though this seemed obvious, what did Beatrice discover
was the actual cause of the problem? _(too much fuel got to the engine after a_
_dive)_


4. **Literal.** How did Beatrice help the Royal Air Force during World War II? _(She_
_found the solution to the problem with the planes and invented a part to fix them.)_


~~**AUTHOR’S PURPOSE AND CRAFT (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students that the author uses clue words or phrases to show us that
the story is being told in chronological order.


 - Explain that chronological order is events happening from beginning to end.
Remember that the events are listed in the order that they happen. Authors
use dates, phrases, or words to show that time has passed. For example,

  - Ask students who they learned about in the previous lesson. _(Beatrice_
_Shilling)_ Ask them to share how Beatrice is similar to and different from the
other people in this unit.


  - Explain that a _quest_ is when someone is seeking or looking for something.
Ask, “Can anyone explain what Amelia Earhart’s quest was?” _(to be the first_
_woman to fly around the world)_


  - Have students preview the front and back covers of today’s Read-Aloud
and read the title. Have them discuss what kind of book this is (fiction or
nonfiction) and what it might be about.


  - Model making a connection to prior knowledge. Think aloud, “The title of this
book and the cover remind me of the passage we read about Amelia Earhart.
I thought the story of Amelia Earhart’s life was very interesting. Because I
already know that she was not able to achieve her goal to be the first woman
to fly around the world, I am looking forward to finding out whether the two
aviators mentioned in the title are able to complete Amelia’s quest.”


~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that they are going to hear a story about two more aviators
from the United States. One is named Jerrie Mock, from Ohio (point it out on
a map). The other is named Joan Merriam Smith, and she was from California
(point it out on a map).

Earhart’s quest in particular as the story is read in order to identify the
important events that take place.


**AIM FOR THE SKIES: JERRIE MOCK AND JOAN MERRIAM SMITH’S**
~~**RACE TO COMPLETE AMELIA EARHART’S QUEST (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Read aloud the trade book _Aim for the Skies: Jerrie Mock and Joan_
_Merriam Smith’s Race to Complete Amelia Earhart’s Quest_ by Aimee
Bissonette. As you read, incorporate the following information and guided
reading supports:


    - On page 8, explain that _stunned_ means when something happens that
causes someone to feel shocked or disbelief. Joan was stunned when she
heard Jerrie was setting out to fly around the world.


    - On page 10, explain that a _companion_ is someone or something that
goes along with someone or something else. Ask, “Who were Joan’s
companions on her flight around the world?” _(a stuffed koala bear and a_
_stuffed polar bear)_


    - One page 12, ask students if they remember what the word _throttle_
means? _(a device on a machine, like a car or airplane, that controls the flow_
_of fuel to an engine allowing the machine to speed up)_


    - Pause after page 12 and ask students whether they remember the story
that was read about another competition between two aviators. _(Louis_
_Blériot and Alberto Santos-Dumont)_


**TEKS 2.6.E** Make connections to personal experiences, ideas in other texts, and society; **TEKS 2.3.B** Use context within and
beyond a sentence to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words.

Point out specific sections
of the text that will help
students find answers to
the questions.


**144**




   - On page 20, explain that _groggy_ means to feel weak or unsteady. Ask,
“Why do you think it would be dangerous to fly an airplane if you feel
groggy?” _(Answers may vary.)_


   - Also explain that _turbulence_ is irregular currents in the atmosphere that
cause an up-and-down motion.


   - After reading, discuss with students how making connections to
information in the story keeps them actively involved in the reading
process and helps them understand and remember what they have read.


   - Ask a volunteer to point out Joan Merriam Smith and Jerrie Mock on the
Aviation Timeline. _(1964)_


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What was Joan Merriam Smith and Jerrie Mock’s quest? _(to be the_
_first woman to fly around the world)_


2. **Literal.** How did Joan and Jerrie end up competing to see who would be the
first to fly around the world? _(They had the goal of being the first woman to_
_fly around the world. The newspapers found out about the two aviators and_
_turned their dream into a competition.)_


3. **Evaluative.** How did the competition push each of the aviators to try harder
to win? _(Answers may vary but should include that each of the aviators_
_pushed each other because they both wanted to be the first woman to fly_
_around the world.)_


4. **Inferential.** Think-Pair-Share: Why do you think Joan decided to finish the
trip even though Jerrie had already won? _(Answers may vary.)_


Unit 11 Flight and the Story of Aviation


~~**WORD WORK: QUEST (5 MIN.)**~~


1. The title of the story contains the line “. . . race to complete Amelia
Earhart’s quest.”


2. A _quest_ is something that is trying to be completed or achieved.


3. In Lesson 8, you learned about Amelia Earhart’s quest. What was her _quest_ ?


4. Can you think of other historical figures that have set forth on a quest?


5. What is the word we have been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** Say: “I am going to read
statements. If the statement describes a quest, say, ‘That is a quest.’ If the
sentence does not describe a quest, say, ‘That is not a quest.’”


 - the Pilgrims coming to America to start a new life _(That is a quest.)_


 - walking from the living room to the kitchen to get a snack _(That is_
_not a quest.)_


 - climbing Mount Everest _(That is a quest.)_

- Remind students that a prepositional phrase is a phrase that begins with
a preposition and is followed by an object (e.g., _in the cave, on the table,_
_under the rock, above the clouds_ ). A prepositional phrase answers the
same question, “where?”, that a preposition answers about something in a
sentence.


- Next, remind students what they have learned about using commas to
separate a series of items (e.g., the dog, the cat, and the mouse) and in
dates (e.g., Friday, November 14, 2025).


- Tell students that peer editing can be very useful because sometimes it is
hard to see mistakes in their own writing.


- Ask for a volunteer to help you model the process of peer editing. Begin by
reading the example paragraph to the volunteer.


- Explain that this is the first step in the review process.


- Next, ask the volunteer to look at the writing with you and use the checklist
to determine which areas need improvement.


- Explain that all areas that receive a “no” or “sometimes” will need to be
corrected.


- Tell students that, after they take turns reviewing their writing with their
partner, they will edit their own writing by making any necessary corrections.


- Model for students how to make corrections on the writing.


- Tell students that they will be given paper to write their final copy on once
their editing is complete.


- Have students group with their partners for peer editing.


- As they work collaboratively, circulate through the classroom and make sure
they are reading their paragraphs to their partner. Some students might
need support as to how to proceed with the checklist because they may get
confused about how to check off what they are doing with their partner and
then what they will be checking on their own.


- When partners are done editing each other’s drafts, you may wish to
conference with them to clear up any confusion and take a look at their
editing before they begin making corrections on their drafts.


- After conferencing, students will be ready to transition into their own editing.


Unit 11 Flight and the Story of Aviation


  - As students work, circulate through the classroom to support them. Some
may need redirection as to what to do next. Others will need to be reminded
to read each sentence at a time and fix it.


  - Once students have finished editing their writing, give them three more
copies of Activity Page 13.1 to write their final copies.


  - After writing each final copy, have them use the frame to illustrate the aviator

**Speaking and Listening:** Students will share their writing by presenting it to
the class.

~~**TEKS 2.1.C; TEKS 2.13.E**~~


~~**SHARING OUR PRESENTATIONS (60 MIN.)**~~


  - Congratulate students for participating in the unit and being
great researchers.


  - Tell students that they can now share with the class what they have found out
about the aviators they chose to research. Explain that they will then be able
to display their writings in the Aviators Hall of Fame.


  - Tell them that before they begin, you will model how to present to the class.


  - Before you begin, brainstorm skills for presenting with students.


  - Write “Skills for Presenting” on the board or chart paper. Some ideas might
be: speak clearly and loud enough so everyone in the classroom can hear,
speak at an appropriate pace, look at the audience from time to time,
practice what you will say.


  - Present the class copy of Activity Page 13.1.


  - After you have finished, tell students that they will be allowed to ask
questions and offer feedback.


  - Tell students that it is important to offer feedback in a positive way. Some
ways they could do this is by telling the presenter something they liked
about the presentation and something that could make it even better. Allow
students to share three positives and one suggestion.


  - Have students present their writing to the class.


  - Consider introducing each presenter with their name and the aviators they
chose to write about to the class.


  - After all students have presented, display their presentations in the Aviators
Hall of Fame.

**The Swing**
Robert Louis Stevenson


How do you like to go up in a swing,
Up in the air so blue?
Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing

Ever a child can do!


Up in the air and over the wall,
Till I can see so wide,
River and trees and cattle and all
Over the countryside—


Till I look down on the garden green,
Down on the roof so brown—
Up in the air I go flying again,
Up in the air and down!

**The Poet and His Song (Stanza 1)**
Paul Laurence Dunbar


A song is but a little thing,
And yet what joy it is to sing!
In hours of toil it gives me zest,
And when at eve I long for rest;

When cows come home along the bars,

And in the fold I hear the bell,
As Night, the shepherd, herds his stars,
I sing my song, and all is well.
