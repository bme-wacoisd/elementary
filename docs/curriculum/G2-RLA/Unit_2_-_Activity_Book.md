Dear Family Member,


### 1.2 Take-Home



Over the next couple of weeks, your student will learn about the ancient Greek
civilization, a group of people whose contributions can be seen in many areas of our lives
today, specifically in our democratic government. Your student will be introduced to the
geography and mythical gods and goddesses of this civilization. They will also learn about
the city-states of Sparta and Athens and the very first Olympic Games held in honor of
Zeus.


Below are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to reinforce what
your student is learning about the ancient Greek civilization.


1. Draw and Write


Ask your student to draw and/or write about what they are learning about the ancient
Greek civilization, such as the mythical gods and goddesses who were believed to live on
Mount Olympus or the first Olympic Games. Ask questions to help your student use the
vocabulary learned at school.


2. Sayings and Phrases: “Where There’s a Will, There’s a Way”


Your student will be learning the saying “where there’s a will, there’s a way.” Talk with
your student about its meaning. Share moments in your life when you or someone you
know has accomplished something because of great determination or a strong will.


3. Words to Use


Below is a list of words that your student will be learning about and using. Try to use
these words as they come up in everyday speech with your student.

**Unit 2**




  - _rugged_ —Although the rugged terrain of ancient Greece made farming difficult,
the olive tree was one hardy plant the Greeks were able to grow in abundance.

  - _massive_ —The ancient Greeks imagined that the mythical god of the sea, Poseidon, was massive in size and strength, for they believed he could make the earth
quake and the waves crash upon the shore.

  - _grove_ —The ancient Greeks believed that at the request of the mythical goddess
Athena, the mythical goddess Demeter made each grove of olive trees grow
strong for the Athenians.

     - _sacred_ —The city of Olympia was a sacred place; the ancient Greeks gathered
there to honor the mythical gods with games and gifts.

     - _self-discipline_ —The people of Sparta were known for their self-discipline, for they
spent their lives training for battle and did not allow themselves any luxuries.


4. Read Aloud Each Day

    - It is very important that you read with your student every day. Set aside time to
read to your student and listen to your student read to you.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing what they have learned
at school.

Dear Family Member,


### 8.2 Take-Home



I hope your student is enjoying learning about the ancient Greek civilization. Over
the next several days, they will learn more about the contributions of this civilization, as
well as the significance of the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae. They will also be
introduced to the Greek philosophers Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, and to the conqueror
Alexander the Great. Your student will also write a fictional narrative using what they have
learned about ancient Greece.


Below are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to reinforce what
your student is learning about the ancient Greek civilization.


1. Draw and Write


Have your student draw and/or write about what they are learning about the ancient
Greek civilization, such as Pheidippides’s marathon run or the Greek philosophers. Ask
questions to help your student use the vocabulary learned at school.


2. Sayings and Phrases: “Practice What You Preach”


Your student will be learning the saying “practice what you preach.” Talk with your
student about its meaning. Share moments in your life when you or someone you know
has lived their life in the same way that they have told others they should live.


3. Words to Use


Below is a list of some of the words that your student will learn about and use. Try to
use these words as they come up in everyday speech with your student.

    - _marathon_ —The ancient Greeks honored Pheidippides for his twenty-six-mile
marathon run.

    - _channel_ —Swimming through the cold waters of the English Channel has been a
challenge for many long-distance swimmers.
