#### Introduction


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching _The War_
_of 1812_ unit. The Teacher Guide for _The War of 1812_ contains eight daily lessons, each of which is
composed of two distinct parts, so that the lesson may be divided into smaller chunks of time and
presented at different intervals during the day. Each entire lesson will require a total of sixty minutes.


This unit includes two days for a Pausing Point following Lesson 4. At the end of the unit, a Unit
Review, a Unit Assessment, and Culminating Activities are included to allow time to review, reinforce,
assess, and remediate content knowledge. You should spend no more than thirteen days total on
this unit.

~~**WHY THE WAR OF 1812 IS IMPORTANT**~~


This unit will introduce students to an important period in the history of the United States—the time
during the War of 1812. The War of 1812 is, perhaps, best remembered as the war that gave birth to
“The Star-Spangled Banner.” Students will also learn why the War of 1812 is often called America’s
second war for independence. Students will learn how the United States was affected by the
Napoleonic Wars between France and Great Britain. They will learn about James and Dolley Madison,
and their direct connection to the War of 1812. Students will learn about Great Britain’s three-part
plan to win back the United States. This includes attacks on Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, and
the attack on New Orleans in an attempt to gain control of the Mississippi River. This unit will build
the foundation for learning about westward expansion, the U.S. Civil War, and immigration later in
Grade 2, as well as for learning about other periods of American history in future grades.


The text that students will be reading and discussing in this unit provides opportunities for
students to build content knowledge and draw connections to social studies. You may build on
class discussions to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of
Citizenship, Geography, History, and Social Studies Skills from the Social Studies TEKS. This
content is not a replacement for grade level science and social studies instruction. For more
information about the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of
the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED**~~


The following units, and the specific core content that was targeted in those units, are particularly
relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _The War of 1812_ . This background knowledge will
greatly enhance students’ understanding of the Read-Alouds they are about to enjoy:


 - **Colonial and Native Americans (Kindergarten)**


 - **America: Our Great Country (Kindergarten)**


 - **American Independence (Grade 1)**


 - **Heading West: Exploring the Frontier (Grade 1)**


Unit 4 The War of 1812


~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR THE WAR OF 1812**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _The War of 1812_ in the forms in which they
appear in the Read-Alouds or, in some instances, in the “Introducing the Read-Aloud” section at the
beginning of the lesson. Boldfaced words in the list have an associated Word Work activity. The inclusion
of the words on this list does not mean that students are immediately expected to be able to use all of
these words on their own. However, through repeated exposure throughout the lessons, they should
acquire a good understanding of most of these words and begin to use some of them in conversation.

**Model Persuasive Speech**


When trading, the most important thing is to be fair! Both sides should decide what is fair
before the trade. The United States traded flour and tobacco with England and France,
in exchange for goods they produced. It’s easy to make a fair trade when both sides talk
about what they want. It’s also important for both sides to try to be fair to each other.
Trading should be fair!


  - Provide several advertisements for students to analyze to determine how
someone persuades others to do or buy something.


**Note to Teacher**


In the very early days of colonial America, England was a kingdom. Later, in
1707, it became a part of the United Kingdom. In this unit, the names _Great_
_Britain_ or _Britain_ will be used.

- Explain that many interesting and important things were happening in the

United States and in other parts of the world in 1812. Several European
nations were at war, and many kings and queens were being removed from
power.


- In 1812, the United States was gaining new states and territories, and was

becoming a strong new nation. As a new nation, the United States wanted to
avoid conflict with other countries.


Unit 4 The War of 1812


  - In 1812, the United States was also growing in strength and in wealth. As

a nation, it depended on trading with both France and Britain. When a war
broke out between these two countries, this greatly affected the United
States. It made trading with them difficult and it hurt the U.S. economy. It
also led to another war between America and Great Britain.

~~**“AMERICA IN 1812, PART I” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 1A-1: Colonists in the colonies**

From 1775 to 1783 America fought Great

Britain for independence. This conflict was

called the Revolutionary War. Against all odds,

America won! What had been the thirteen

original colonies officially became the United





States of America. After gaining independence,

the American people did not want kings or



queens governing them anymore. Americans wanted to create a new kind

of government. They wanted to be able to elect individuals to **represent** the

people and act with their best interests in mind. They wanted a government

that was “by the people, for the people.” ~~Represent~~ ~~_means to speak for or take_~~

~~_action in place of someone else. So, they wanted to elect people who would be_~~

~~_able to speak for and govern them with their best interests in mind._~~


**Show Image 1A-2: The Constitutional**

To help create the new form of government,

several elected leaders met in Philadelphia

in May and June of 1787. Some leaders





who could not attend, such as Thomas

Jefferson and John Adams, wrote down their

Unit 4 The War of 1812


ideas. ~~_Remember, Thomas Jefferson was the third president. John Adams_~~

~~_was the second president._~~ Together this group of leaders became known as

“the Founding Fathers.” The Founding Fathers’ ideas all came together in a

document called the U.S. Constitution.


**Show Image 1A-3: The Constitution**

The Constitution became the framework

for the American government. ~~_A framework_~~

~~_is the basic structure of something._~~ A man

named James Madison had a clear vision of

how the United States should govern itself.





James Madison is known as “the Father of the

Constitution” because he put all of the ideas



together by writing the Constitution with the help of George Washington and

others. He also became the fourth president of the United States.


**Show Image 1A-4: Map of America in 1805**

For many years after the Revolutionary War,

the United States grew larger and wealthier.

New states, such as Vermont, Kentucky,

Tennessee, Ohio, and Louisiana, were added.

New territories were also settled. In 1803,





President Thomas Jefferson purchased the

Louisiana Territory from France. This purchase



more than doubled the size of the United States. ~~_[Point to the area of the_~~

~~_Louisiana Territory on the map.]_~~


**Show Image 1A-5: England and France fighting**

Meanwhile, across the Atlantic Ocean, France

and Britain went to war against each other.

This series of wars became known as the

Napoleonic [/n Ə *poe*lee*on*ik/] Wars,

named after the French leader at the time,





Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon Bonaparte

wanted to make France the most powerful



nation in the world. Britain was determined to stop him. The United States

considered both France and Great Britain to be its friends. It did not want

to get involved in these costly and destructive wars. Even though the

Napoleonic Wars were being fought all the way across the Atlantic Ocean,

they greatly affected the United States.


Lesson 1 America in 1812, Part I
**15**


**Show Image 1A-6: Busy American port**

Much of the United States’ growth during this

time depended upon **trade** with France and

Great Britain. ~~Trade~~ ~~_refers to the business of_~~

~~_buying and selling goods._~~ Britain and France

had many merchant, or trading, ships. These

ships sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to trade

goods with the United States, Canada, and with



many of the British- and French-owned islands in the Caribbean. For example,

the United States sent flour and tobacco to France and Great Britain. Great

Britain and France received sugar and coffee or cocoa from other countries.


Both countries wanted to stop the other from trading with the United States.

They each also tried to prevent the other from getting money and supplies.

They also did not want the United States to choose sides.



Challenge


What role did France

play in the American

Revolutionary War?

_(France supported_
_the colonists against_

_Great Britain.)_



both had large naval fleets positioned in the Atlantic Ocean to attack each

other’s ships. To make matters worse, the British and the French began to

**seize**, or capture, American ships loaded with valuable cargo. It became

almost impossible to safely transport goods from the United States to

foreign ports. It was also more and more difficult for Americans to receive

much-needed goods.


**Show Image 1A-8: Impressment of sailors by**
**the British navy**

Merchant ships weren’t the only ships in the

sea! The United States and Great Britain

also had naval ships. Life in the British navy

was not easy. Conditions on their naval ships





**Show Image 1A-7: Map of shipping trade**
**routes** ~~_[Point to the Atlantic Ocean and the_~~

~~_trading routes on the map.]_~~

To keep the French from trading with the

United States, the British **blockaded**, or

blocked, several U.S. ports. They also blocked

several important ports in Europe. This

seriously hurt U.S. trade. France and Britain





were terrible, and punishments were harsh.

Because of this, the British navy had a hard



**16**



time finding men who wanted to be sailors. To get more sailors, the British


Unit 4 The War of 1812


began to capture men from other countries’ ships and force them to join the

British navy. Sometimes these sailors were British deserters. ~~_A deserter is_~~

~~_someone who runs away from military duty._~~ However, more times than not,

the sailors who were seized weren’t even British. But that did not stop the

British from doing it. They even seized many U.S. sailors. This practice of

forcing men into the British navy was called _impressment_ .


Check for Understanding


**Turn and Talk:** Turn to your partner and describe the way the
British tried to keep the French from trading with the United
States. _(They blockaded U.S. and European ports.)_ Then have your
partner describe how the British got more sailors to serve in the
British navy. _(They used_ impressment _, or the practice of forcing_
_men into the British navy.)_


[Have several students share their answers with the class.]


**Show Image 1A-9: Naval ship USS President**

The impressment of U.S. citizens upset the

American people and the U.S. government.

As time went on, the United States found

that it was losing more and more valuable

cargo, sailors, money, and even ships. They





demanded that the British stop impressing

American sailors. But the British refused.

convince readers. Re-read the first sentence with the class.

    - Ask: Is the following sentence a fact or opinion? “When trading, the most
important thing is to be fair!”

    - _Answer: Opinion, because the phrase “the most important thing” reflects a belief._


  - Re-read the third sentence with the class.

    - Ask: Is the following sentence a fact or opinion? “The United States

traded flour and tobacco with England and France in exchange for goods
they produced.”

    - _Answer: Fact, because we can use documents to prove what was traded_
_among these countries._

    - Ask students what this speech is trying to convince the reader to do or
believe.

    - _Answer: The author is trying to persuade the reader to be fair when trading._

usually includes the person’s head and shoulders. Invite different students
to point out the head and shoulders of the men in these three image cards. If
you have additional examples of portraits, share those now. Image Cards 4–6


  - Explain that, because cameras were not yet invented, portraits in the early
1800s were hand-drawn or painted. Ask students whether these portraits
look hand-drawn, or sketched, or whether they look painted. _(painted)_


  - Ask students to identify the people they recognize in the image cards. Explain

that these portraits are of the first three presidents of the United States:
George Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson.


  - Tell students that they are going to be making their own portraits to help them
remember some of the important people and places connected to the War of 1812.


  - Tell students that today they will be making a self-portrait using Activity Page

James Madison was the fourth president of the

United States. Like the other presidents before

him, he tried to find a way to avoid conflict

with Britain. He knew that the United States

was still a young nation with fewer than eight





million people. ~~_That’s about the same number_~~

~~_of people today in New York City._~~ He knew they

did not have a large army or navy. But the War Hawks believed that if the

United States was going to fight Britain, now was the time. Britain was busy

fighting the Napoleonic Wars. It would not have enough soldiers, sailors, and

ships to fight the United States, too. Some Americans thought that winning a

war with Britain might also be an opportunity to gain more land.


There was land to the north and to the south that they wanted. Finally, the

War Hawks wanted to prove that the United States was a strong country.


Still, President Madison did not want to rush into war. He continued to

ask the British government to stop interfering with U.S. ships, and to stop

trading with and arming Native Americans. However, the British continued to

ignore the president’s requests. With the War Hawks demanding war, James

Madison finally agreed. On June 18, 1812, the United States declared war on

Great Britain.

~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Refer to the timeline on display.


1. **Inferential.** Why do you think the United States wanted to have a good
relationship with Britain and France? _(Answers may vary but could include_
_that as a young nation, with a small army and navy, they did not want to go to_
_war. They also wanted to trade with both Britain and France.)_


2. **Literal.** What term was used to describe the people in the U.S. government
who wanted to go to war with Great Britain? _(War Hawks)_


3. **Literal.** What events led the War Hawks to want to go to war with Great
Britain in the early 1800s? _(The British blockaded U.S. ports, impressed_
_sailors, stole U.S. cargo, broke a treaty with the United States, attacked the_
_USS_ Chesapeake _, and armed Native Americans.)_

   - **Inferential.** Why do you think Native Americans did not want settlers
on their land? _(Answers may vary, but may include that they feared the_
_settlers would take their land away from them.)_


4. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ Why would the British want to arm Native
Americans? How would that benefit the British? [You may also ask students
to think about why the Native Americans wanted to help the British.]

It was a beautiful spring day in central Virginia.

Ten-year-old J.P. and his younger sister, Adele

Grandfather Lafitte loved to tell the children stories. Today he had promised

to tell them all about the War of 1812. J.P. was learning about this war in

school and, of course, Adele wanted to know everything about anything

that her brother was doing. Before he retired, their grandfather had been a

history professor. ~~_A professor is someone who teaches college students._~~ He

declared that he was an expert on the subject.


**Show Image 3A-2: Grandfather and children**

Grandfather Lafitte was waiting for the

children on the front porch. As J.P. and Adele

their grandfather, Adele noticed that he was





holding an old, leather-bound journal.


“What do you have there?” asked Adele

She had just turned eight, and J.P. said she was always full of questions!


“Oh, this journal belonged to your great, great, great, great grandfather. He

fought in the War of 1812. I will tell you more about him later,” Grandfather

Lafitte explained. “Now where should I begin?” he asked eagerly.


“I have a list of **topics** that I need to learn about,” started J.P. ~~_Topics are the_~~

~~_main subjects of a discussion, a paper, or a project._~~


“He has to know about President James Madison and his wife, Dolley,” Adele

interrupted excitedly.


“Yes,” said J.P., finishing what he was saying, “I have to know about the

beginning of the war, the USS _Constitution_, the attacks on Washington, D.C.,

and Baltimore, Andrew Jackson and the Battle of New Orleans, and how the

war ended.”


“Well, that’s quite a list,” exclaimed Grandfather Lafitte. “We’d better get

started then. It sounds like you do not need to know anything about pirates,”

he added with a curious tone.


“Pirates!” gasped J.P. “Were there pirates in the War of 1812?”


“We shall see,” chuckled Grandfather Lafitte. “I think I will start at the

beginning and tell you about the man who was president when the war

began.” ~~_Who was our fourth president?_~~


“James Madison!” said Adele proudly. She had recently attended a school

field trip to Montpelier [/mont*peel*yer/] because it was close to their

home. She learned a lot about James Madison.


**Show Image 3A-3: James Madison as a**

Grandfather began, “James Madison was

born on March 16, 1751. He grew up on a large

plantation in central Virginia not far from where

we are right now. ~~_A plantation is a large farm._~~



Challenge


If Montpelier is close
to their home, in which

His family home was called Montpelier. As a

young boy, Jemmy—as his father called him—



was homeschooled, or taught at home. It’s been said that he read every book

that his father had in his library. And Mr. Madison had a lot of books!


When he was seventeen, James went to the College of New Jersey, which is

**45**


now called Princeton University. Just as he did when he was young, James

Madison loved to read. He enjoyed learning Latin and Greek and debating in

college. ~~Debating~~ ~~_means discussing something with someone whose opinion_~~

~~_might be different than your own, similar to what you will do when you present_~~

~~_your persuasive speeches._~~ James actually graduated from college in only two

years.” ~~_Today, it usually takes twice that long, or four years, to finish college._~~


“I like learning Spanish in school,” Adele added enthusiastically.


“I’m glad that you do,” replied Grandfather Lafitte, smiling at his

granddaughter. He continued, “As a young man, James Madison did not like

the way the colonies were run by Britain. He thought the colonists should be

able to **govern** themselves ~~_or be responsible for making their own decisions_~~ .

In 1774, when he was just twenty-three years old, James Madison became a

leader in the House of Burgesses. ~~_The House of Burgesses was the first form_~~

~~_of government in colonial America._~~ The next year, the colonies were at war

with Great Britain. ~~_Do you know what war it was?_~~ This war, the Revolutionary

War, lasted until 1783. Americans won their freedom, and they became

In fact, much of the Constitution was written by James Madison. But he did

get some help from George Washington and many other Founding Fathers.

James Madison also helped to write another part of the Constitution called

the Bill of Rights.” ~~_The Bill of Rights protects American people and their_~~

~~_property._~~

Todd. ~~_Does_~~ ~~previously~~ ~~_mean before or after?_~~ She and her husband, John,

had two sons: John Payne and William. Sadly, Dolley’s first husband and her

youngest son, William, both died from yellow fever. Dolley, who was known to

be very cheerful and outgoing, turned to her friends and family for support.

Her friends introduced her to James Madison. When they met, James

Madison was a member of the House of Representatives. They liked each

other and began to spend more and more time together. They got married in

September, 1794.”


“Where did they live after they got married?” asked Adele.

“Washington, D.C.!” exclaimed Adele.


“Exactly!” replied Grandfather Lafitte. “James Madison became Thomas

Jefferson’s secretary of state. That meant that he was responsible for dealing

with other countries on behalf of the United States. Almost immediately, he

had problems with Great Britain and France.”


“What kind of problems, Grandfather?” asked Adele.


“Both countries were interfering with U.S. merchant ships,” said Grandfather.


“Why were they doing that?” asked J.P., who by now had finished his entire

“You see, a series of wars had broken out in

Europe. ~~_[Point to Europe on a world map or_~~

military leader Napoleon Bonaparte.

Napoleon wanted France to become the most

powerful nation in the world. But Great Britain

and other European nations wanted to stop him. Britain had one problem,

though. Although it had a powerful navy, it did not have enough sailors.

~~_Everyone knew the war was coming, but nobody wanted it to come._~~ Many

members of Congress were urging him to declare war on Great Britain. They

thought the British had been arming Native Americans and were encouraging

them to fight American settlers moving west. James Madison felt that he had

no other option but to lead his nation into war. On June 18, 1812, the United

States declared war on Great Britain.”


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What job did James Madison hold in 1812? _(He was the fourth_
_president of the United States.)_


2. **Inferential.** What events in his life prior to becoming the fourth president
prepared James Madison to be president in 1812? _(He was a government_
_leader in the House of Burgesses in Virginia; he played an important role in_
_writing and adopting the Constitution; he served as secretary of state while_
_Thomas Jefferson was president, and, as secretary of state, worked with the_
_British to try to get them to stop the practice of impressment.)_


3. **Literal.** What role did Dolley Madison play in the United States in 1812?
_(Dolley Madison was the First Lady of the United States in 1812. As First Lady,_
_she served as the hostess of the White House, and she helped design the_
_interior of the White House. She preserved her husband’s legacy by copying_
_his documents.)_


4. **Inferential.** How did Dolley Madison’s early life and personality prepare
her to be the First Lady of the United States? _(She was a cheerful, outgoing_
_person, and she was an excellent hostess.)_


5. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ Why do you think James Madison was not
eager to go to war? _(Answers may vary, but could include that the United_
_States was a young nation; it did not have a large navy or army; the nation_
_didn’t have enough money to pay for a war; the United States might not win;_
_war is bad/scary; etc.)_

against going to war in 1812.


~~**TEKS 2.12.B**~~


~~**SYNTACTIC AWARENESS ACTIVITY (5 MIN.)**~~


**Suffixes**


The purpose of these syntactic activities is to help students understand the
direct connection between grammatical structures and the meaning of text.
These syntactic activities should be used in conjunction with the complex
text presented in the Read-Alouds.


**Note:** There may be variations in the sentences created by your class.
Allow for these variations and restate students’ sentences so that they are
grammatical.

  - Explain to students that a suffix is something that is added to the end of a
word to give it a new meaning.

  - Explain that the suffix – _ful_ tells us that the word might mean full of
something.

  - Explain that the suffix – _less_ tells us that the word might mean without or not
having something.

  - Explain that students heard in the Read-Aloud today, “Dolley. . . was known to
be very cheerful and outgoing.”

  - Divide the word _cheerful_ into two parts: _cheer_ and – _ful_ . Explain that _cheer_ by
itself means joy or happiness. The suffix – _ful_ means full of. When these are
combined, they become the word _cheerful_ . _Cheerful_ is a word that describes
someone as happy or full of joy.

  - Explain that the suffix – _less_ means “without.”

  - Have students listen for the suffix – _less_ in the following sentence: My mother
decided to paint the dark and cheerless room a brighter color. Have students
identify the meaning of _cheerless_ in the sentence. _(without cheer, or gloomy)_

  - Have students identify the meaning of the word _breathless_ . _(out of breath)_

~~**WRITE A PERSUASIVE SPEECH (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students that in the last lesson they planned a persuasive speech
that they will deliver to James Madison. They will write the speech based on
the point of view of a War Hawk, arguing for the war, or from the point of view
of a merchant in 1812, arguing against going to war.


 - Place students in small groups to write their speeches, and have them turn to
Activity Pages 2.3 and 3.1. Remind students that they wrote the plan for their
speech on Activity Page 2.3, and they will use Activity Page 3.1 today to write
the speech.


 - Explain to students that they will write their introduction in the top box on
Activity Page 3.1. Explain that this introduction, or opening, will describe
which group they are representing (i.e., the War Hawks or the merchants).


 - Direct students’ attention to the second box on Activity Page 3.1, and explain
that students will write their opinion about the war in the box (i.e., whether
they support or oppose going to war).


 - Explain that students should use the next two boxes to record two arguments
in support of their position.


 - Remind students that the linking words _because_ and _also_ will connect their
arguments to their position. For example, they may say, “I support going to
war because . . . and also . . .”


 - In the last box on Activity Page 3.1, students should write a closing sentence,
or conclusion.


 - Tell students that they will begin presenting their speeches in the next lesson.

“Well,” replied Grandfather Lafitte, “the answers to both of those questions

are related. To answer your question first, J.P., we did not have a large army

or navy back then. We had a fairly small navy and only about four thousand

soldiers. ~~_Today’s army has almost 500,000 soldiers, and there are more than_~~

~~_[Point to the army (right) and the navy (left) as_~~

To fight a war and have any chance of winning,

the president had to find more soldiers pretty

quickly. Remember, in 1812, many Americans

were farmers. They used guns to hunt and to

protect their homes. President Madison now



asked farmers to use their guns to fight for their country. He offered them

money and land if they would join.”


“Did they?” asked Adele.


“Although some people were against the war,” explained Grandfather Lafitte,

“many men were eager to join. These soldiers didn’t always get the best

military training, though. That is why, in the beginning of the war, things did

not go so well for us. Our government and military leaders were counting

on the fact that the British were so busy fighting the French that they

would not be able to put up much of a fight against us. They hoped that the

British would not have a large enough army. In fact, some people expected

the British to give up almost immediately. As it turned out, none of these

**assumptions** were right.” ~~_An assumption is something that is believed to be_~~

“We certainly did. That was where we had

some important victories,” replied Grandfather

Lafitte. “You mentioned the USS _Constitution_



on your list. That ship was also known back then as ‘Old Ironsides.’ In the very

beginning of the war this incredible ship defeated a British ship off the coast

of Canada. Both ships fought a hard battle. At one point, the two ships were

right next to each other! Cannonballs from the USS _Constitution_ smashed

into the sides of the British ship. They caused a lot of damage. And even

though the British ship fired back, they did much less damage to our ship.

It’s said that some of their cannonballs even bounced off the side of the

_Constitution_ because its walls were so thick!”


“Is that how it got its nickname?” asked Adele. ~~_What was its nickname?_~~


“Yes. Thanks to ‘Old Ironsides,’ the British were forced to surrender.


It is probably safe to say that, at least in the early stages of the war, we were

much more successful at sea than we were on land.”


“Hooray!” cheered J.P. and Adele together.

~~_on private ships that are hired to attack and rob other ships._~~


“Oh, is this the part when you tell us about pirates?” asked J.P. eagerly.


“Not quite!” chuckled Grandfather Lafitte. “Many of the privateers in the War

of 1812 were hired by the United States government. However, it’s true, some

of these privateers had previously been pirates. There is one privateer in

particular that I’m going to tell you about later. But we haven’t quite gotten

to that part of the story.”

“Did the Americans think we would win the war

of 1812?” asked Adele.


“We weren’t sure, but we were determined not





to give up,” explained Grandfather Lafitte. “The

next year we sent our army back into Canada.

We took back the town we had lost so that we



could protect our territories again. This gave us hope. We had another victory

later that year when our navy defeated an entire fleet of British ships on Lake

Erie.” ~~_A fleet is a group of military ships run by the same leader._~~


**Show Image 4A-8: Naval ship USS President**

“Was that when we knew we would win?”

asked J.P.


“No. We were never completely sure that we

could win,” replied Grandfather. “You see, by





1814 the end of the Napoleonic Wars was in

sight. That meant that the British would have

full attention toward the war with the United States.


“Of course, they were still keeping many foreign ships from entering U.S.

ports.” Grandfather added, “To make matters worse, they knew the United

States was almost out of money.”

“Did the British think we would surrender?” asked J.P.


“Oh, they probably did,” replied Grandfather thoughtfully.

“What happened next?” Adele wanted to know.


“Before I explain, we need to go down to the

barn and take care of the horses.”





“Okay!” exclaimed the children as they jumped

up out of their chairs and off the porch.



Adele grabbed her grandfather’s hand and the three walked together to the

barn. Grandfather still held the mysterious leather journal tightly in his other

hand.


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Inferential.** What role did Great Britain’s war with France have on the war

with the United States? _(Answers may vary, but should include that, although_
_U.S. military leaders thought that war would distract Great Britain enough so_
_the U.S. would have an easy victory, it did not have that effect.)_

   - **Literal.** Which country was Britain already fighting against? (France)


2. **Literal.** What effect did the end of the Napoleonic Wars have on the War
of 1812? _(It allowed the British to shift all their attention to fighting with the_
_United States.)_


3. **Literal.** Describe the three-part plan of attack the British had. _(They first_
_planned to attack from Canada in the north to enter the state of New York;_
_then they planned to attack east coast cities such as Washington, D.C., and_
_Baltimore; and finally they planned to capture New Orleans and gain control of_
_the Mississippi River.)_


4. **Inferential.** Why did the British want to prevent the United States from
getting supplies? _(Answers may vary, but should include that, without_
_supplies, the U.S. might not be able to fight for long and would have to_
_surrender.)_


5. **Literal.** What was the USS _Constitution_ and why was it called “Old
Ironsides”? _(It was a U.S. naval ship, and it was called that because, during_
_battle, British cannonballs bounced off its sides.)_

You should pause here and spend two days reviewing, reinforcing, or
extending the material taught thus far.


You may have students do any combination of the activities listed below, but
it is highly recommended that you use the Mid-Unit Assessment to assess
students’ knowledge of the War of 1812. The other activities may be done in
any order. You may also choose to do an activity with the whole class or with
a small group of students who would benefit from the particular activity.

~~**ACTIVITIES**~~


**Present a Persuasive Speech**


If any students were not able to finish presenting the persuasive speech in
Lesson 4, have them do so now. Flip Book Poster 1M


**Multiple Meaning Word Activity**

Materials: Poster 1M (Branches)

  - [Show Poster 2M (Branches).] Remind students that they heard in a ReadAloud, “[James Madison] was responsible for organizing the government into
three branches with different powers.” Explain that the word _branches_ here
means the three parts of the U.S. government. Point to Image 1 on the poster.


Pausing Point
**69**


**70**




 - Remind students that branches are also parts of a tree that grow out from
the trunk. Point to the branches in Image 2.


 - Explain that the word _branches_ also means local offices of a business. Point
to the bank branch in Image 3.


 - Finally, explain that branches are also things that go outward from a main line
or source. Point to the river branches in Image 4.


 - Have students work with a partner to make a sentence for each meaning of
_branches_ .


 - Call on a few partner pairs to share one or all of their sentences. Have them
point to the meaning of _branches_ that their sentence uses.


**“Old Ironsides” by Oliver Wendell Holmes**

 - Explain to students that an ode is a poem that honors or celebrates a person,
place, or thing. Explain that a long time ago, a famous American poet named
Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote an ode to the USS _Constitution_ . Obtain a copy
of this poem either from your library or on the internet.


 - Originally this ship was going to be destroyed shortly after it defeated a
British ship at sea because it was no longer needed. Oliver Wendell Holmes,
who read that the USS _Constitution_ was going to be broken apart, wrote the
ode as a tribute—and honor—to the ship. In the end, the USS _Constitution_
was saved from being destroyed, and people can still visit the ship in the
Boston Harbor today. Show Image Card 9 (USS _Constitution_ today).


 - Ask students to describe what they see in the image card, and then read

the poem. For the first reading, read it straight through from beginning to
end. For the second reading, read it line by line, and explain what the poet is
saying. _(The poet is telling about how the ship is going to be destroyed: “tear_
_her tattered ensign [flag] down”; “shall sweep the clouds no more.”_ _The poet_
_is telling about how the ship fought in battle: “the battle shout”; “burst the_
_cannon’s roar.”)_


**Note:** ”Old Ironsides” by Oliver Wendell Holmes is a long poem. Rather than
read the whole poem, you may read and discuss an important selection with
your class.


Unit 4 The War of 1812


**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**


Materials: Chart paper

  - Give students a key unit concept or vocabulary word such as _trade_ . Have
them brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear the words
_merchant ship_, _blockaded_, _treaty_, _privateers_, etc. Record their responses on a
piece of chart paper for reference.


**A Picture Gallery of America in 1812: Art Gallery and Portfolios**


Materials: Posterboard; tape; hole punch; ribbon

  - Tell students that a gallery is a place where people go to look at paintings or
other forms of artwork. Explain that a portfolio is a collection of drawings,
paintings, or photographs often presented in a folder. Tell students that they
are going to make their own portfolios to save the artwork they created so far
to show America in 1812. (You may also want to create a special gallery space
in the classroom or hallway to display some of students’ artwork.)


  - Directions to make a portfolio for each student: Fold a piece of posterboard

(22" x 28") in half. Tape the sides of the posterboard with colored duct
tape. To make carrying handles, hole punch two holes centered at the top,
approximately 5 inches apart. Knot a piece of grosgrain ribbon (about 12"
long) into each side. (Instead of posterboard, you may also use file folders
duct-taped along the side.)


**Friendship Treaty**

  - In Lesson 2, “America in 1812, Part II,” students heard about Jay’s Treaty.
Remind them that a treaty is a formal agreement between two or more
countries. Treaties often include agreed-upon ways to get along.


  - Ask students if they have ever been in a situation in which they needed to

find a way to work things out with a friend. For example, perhaps sometimes
they had to decide which friends to play with. Or, perhaps sometimes they
and their friends disagreed. Have students think of two things that they and
their friends could do so that they can get along. Have them write their ideas
in one to three complete sentences.


Pausing Point

**Class Book: The War of 1812**


Materials: Drawing paper, drawing tools

 - Tell the class or a group of students that they are going to make a class book
to help them remember what they have learned thus far in this unit. Have
students brainstorm important information about what the British were
doing to U.S. ships and sailors, British relationships with Native Americans,
James and Dolley Madison, and the USS _Constitution_ . Have each student
choose one idea to draw a picture of and then write a caption for the picture.
Bind the pages to make a book to put in the class library for students to read
again and again. You may choose to add more pages upon completion of the
entire unit before binding the book.


 - Another option is to create an ABC book where students brainstorm unitrelated words for each letter of the alphabet.


**Using a Map**


Materials: U.S. map, Flip Book for The War of 1812

 - Use the map on Flip Book Image 4A-3 and the map of the United States
to review various locations from the Read-Alouds. Prompt students with
questions such as the following:


   - (map on Flip Book Image 4A-3) The British had a three-part plan of attack.
What were the three parts of the attack?


   - (U.S. map) Thomas Jefferson purchased land from France that became

known as the Louisiana Territory. Locate that area of the United States on
the map.


   - (U.S. map) You learned that Britain had some control over land in the

Northern Great Lakes region, the Northwestern Territories, and Canada.
Can you locate these three locations?


**Writing Prompts**

 - Students may be given an additional writing prompt such as the following:


   - Imagine that you are on a U.S. merchant ship that has been stopped and
searched by the British. Describe this experience as if you were there.


   - Imagine that you are a Native American witnessing more and more settlers
moving onto your land. They are farming and building homes on land that
belonged to your ancestors. Explain how you feel about this.


   - What do you think life was like for Dolley Madison as the wife of the
president during the War of 1812? Write an imaginary journal or diary entry
that Dolley might have written.

They put their plan into action in the summer of 1814. They sent an army of

about 4,000 men to the capital. ~~_Remember, the entire U.S. Army was only_~~

to cope with the heat when they heard that the British had landed an army

near their city. At the time, there were about 8,000 people living in the new

capital.” ~~_So if the army was 4,000 and only 8,000 people lived there, that is a_~~

~~_huge force!_~~


“What did the president do?” asked J.P. as he chewed on a piece of hay.


**Show Image 5A-3: The U.S. Capitol before it**
**was burned**

“The president knew that he had to be with his

soldiers as they faced the British Army. He told

Mrs. Madison to stay in the President’s House.

He asked some soldiers to stay with her and to





keep her safe. Then he rode off to be with his

army.” ~~_Why do you think the president rode off_~~

~~_to join the army?_~~



**78**



“Where did he go?” asked Adele.


“There was a battle fought in Maryland, just a few miles from the city.

The British beat the U.S. Army pretty quickly and then marched on to

Washington, D.C. Many of the people in the city left when they heard that

their army had been defeated and that the British were coming. The dirt

roads were jammed with people trying to escape, as well as carts piled high

with their possessions.” ~~_People’s possessions are the things they own—their_~~

~~_belongings._~~

“I think I would have been scared,” said Adele.


“Yes, Adele, war can be scary,” reassured Grandfather Lafitte. “We are proud

of those soldiers who fought to protect our country back then, just as we are

proud of those in the military today who work hard to keep us safe.”


**Show Image 5A-4: The portrait of George**
**Washington being saved**

“What happened to Mrs. Madison?” J.P. asked,

now with a barn cat sprawled across his lap.


“Excellent question,” replied Grandfather





Lafitte. “Mrs. Madison had waited to see what

would happen. When she realized that the

British were on their way, she got ready to



leave. She wanted to try to save some of her things, but she did not know

what to bring with her. The President’s House contained so many beautiful

and valuable items, but she knew she could not take everything. In the

end, Dolley Madison saved important papers and letters that she knew her

husband would want. At the last minute, a painting of George Washington

was also saved.


“With the British Army so close, they did not have time to carefully remove

the **canvas** from the frame. ~~_Canvas is a special type of cloth artists use to_~~

~~_paint on. So the painting was on canvas._~~ Instead, the painting and the frame

were taken off the wall. Dolley Madison and others in the President’s House

made it out of the house just in the nick of time. And George Washington was

saved!” ~~_[Show Image Card 4 (Portrait of George Washington).] This is the_~~

~~_famous painting of George Washington. It still hangs in the White House today._~~


“What happened when the British soldiers got there?” asked J.P. as he petted

his new friend, the barn cat.

“The British broke down the doors and rushed

inside. It seems Mrs. Madison had set the

the British soldiers later described finding

a large table in the dining room set for forty

guests. They described the crystal glasses,

In the kitchen, meat had been roasting on the fire, and pots and pans had

been placed upon the grate. It was clear that the residents of the house

had left in a hurry. Some of the British soldiers sat down at the dinner table

and enjoyed a tasty meal. For some of these men, it was the first home
cooked meal they’d eaten in quite some time. When they were done, they

ransacked the house. ~~Ransacked~~ ~~_means to have looked for something in a_~~

~~_way that caused disorder or made a mess._~~ They stole anything they could

carry away and then, before they left, they set fire to the President’s House.

buildings. Many of them had just been built.

“That is sad,” said Adele as she peered down at her grandfather.


“Well, my next story will cheer you up,” said Grandfather Lafitte joyfully. “The

**Evaluate:** What is the main topic of this Read-Aloud? ( _the British_
_attack on Washington, D.C., in 1814_ )


1. **Inferential.** Why did the British want to attack Washington, D.C.? _(The_
_British thought that the United States might consider surrendering if they_
_attacked the capital.)_


2. **Literal.** What did James Madison do when he heard that the British were
coming? _(He left the President’s House and went to be with the army.)_


3. **Literal.** What did the British do when they reached the capital? ( _They_
_destroyed all of the public buildings._ ) Why did they burn the President’s
House? _(That is where they thought the president was; there were many_
_important documents inside the President’s House.)_


4. **Evaluative.** What items did Dolley Madison and others in the President’s
House save? _(important letters and papers)_ Why do you think they saved
a portrait of George Washington? _(Answers may vary, but could include_
_that they knew it would have historical significance/be important to future_
_generations because George Washington was the first president; he helped_
_win the Revolutionary War; etc.)_


5. **Evaluative.** _What? Pair-Share:_ Asking questions after a Read-Aloud is
one way to see how much everyone has learned. Think of a question you
can ask your neighbor about the Read-Aloud that starts with the word
_what_ . For example, you could ask, “What happened in Washington, D.C., in
1814?” Turn to your neighbor and ask your _what_ question. Listen to your
neighbor’s response. Then your neighbor will ask a new _what_ question,
and you will get a chance to respond. I will call on several of you to share
your questions with the class.

“As you can imagine,” Grandfather Lafitte replied, “the British were feeling

very **confident** . ~~_If they were confident, it means they believed they could_~~

~~_win._~~ They had defeated the U.S. Army in Washington and destroyed the

capital. They planned to capture Baltimore next, which at the time was a very

important **port** .”


“What is a port?” asked Adele.


**Show Image 6A-2: A busy U.S. port**

“A port is a town or city where ships stop

to load and unload cargo. Baltimore was a

deepwater port, meaning that the water was

deep enough for really big ships to sail in and

dock there. Baltimore was a port where ships





could send and receive goods such as flour,

tobacco, and sugar,” explained Grandfather



Support


Point to these cities on a

U.S. map.

Lafitte. “Besides that, Baltimore is a central location between New York and

Philadelphia to the north, and Washington to the south.


But, for the British it would provide a place to land a huge invading army.”


**Show Image 6A-3: Cargo (tea, sugar, flour,**
**etc.)** ~~_These are examples of the goods that the_~~
~~_United States and Britain traded._~~

“So if the British destroyed the capital and

then captured Baltimore, they would gain

an advantage,” said J.P. ~~_An advantage is_~~





~~_something that gives someone a better chance_~~

~~_to accomplish something._~~



“That’s right,” said Grandfather Lafitte. “Capturing Baltimore was a key part

of the British plan. From there they hoped to attack other important cities.

But I will tell you what actually happened.


“The Battle of Baltimore can be divided into two parts—the battles on

land and the battles at sea. The British general in charge of the attack on

Washington, D.C., thought that they could capture Baltimore as easily as

they did the capital.”


“Oh, boy!” sighed J.P. “These cats are interested in the story, too.” At that

moment a second barn cat had come to join the first one. The second cat

was attempting to sit on J.P.’s chest.


Unit 4 The War of 1812


**Show Image 6A-4: Entrenchments**

“That’s not what happened though,” continued

Grandfather Lafitte. “The people of Baltimore

knew that the British were coming, and they

prepared themselves for a fight. A commander

of the U.S. Army ordered that huge earth

banks, called entrenchments, be built along

the eastern side of the city. They knew that



the British soldiers would have to begin their attack there. Sure enough, one

September morning, the British landed several thousand soldiers at a place

called North Point.”


“What is an en-trench-ment?” Adele repeated the word she didn’t

understand as she dangled a long piece of string above a barn cat’s head.


“Entrenchments are structures created to protect an area and the people

in it. Entrenchments can be made by either digging into the ground or by

building walls above the ground. The entrenchments acted as a defensive

wall and as a means of targeting the advancing army,” explained Grandfather

Lafitte. “In addition to building the entrenchments, the army got ready to

defend Fort McHenry.” ~~_[Point to the picture.] This is an example of a type of_~~

~~_entrenchment. Do you think building the entrenchments was a good idea?_~~


“Was the purpose of Fort McHenry to protect Baltimore’s harbor?” asked J.P.

British soldiers began to advance on the city. They kept coming until they

were finally pushed back by a large U.S. Army.” ~~_[Point out the large army in_~~

“Did the British give up?” asked J.P.

“Not yet,” replied Grandfather Lafitte. “They **withdrew** ~~_or pulled back_~~ and

set up camp. The next morning the battle continued. The British marched

right up to the entrenchments at North Point. This time they didn’t just face

a larger U.S. Army, but lots of cannons and other weapons, too. The British

quickly realized that they were out-gunned. They retreated, and we won the

Battle of North Point.”


“But what happened at Fort McHenry?” asked Adele.


**Show Image 6A-6: Fort McHenry with the big**

**flag**

“That’s quite a story,” said Grandfather

Lafitte as he laughed quietly. “The people of

Baltimore had imagined that they were in for a

long, hard fight. And so they prepared for one.





Besides building entrenchments, they stored

supplies. They even sank some of their own



ships so that the British would not be able to sail into the harbor.”


“They sank their own ships?!” asked J.P., astonished.


“Yes, they did,” explained Grandfather Lafitte. “Another important part of

the preparation included the creation of a new flag for Fort McHenry. The

commander of the fort, George Armistead, wanted a flag so big that the

British sailors would be able to see it from far away. A lady named Mary

Pickersgill was asked to make the flag.” ~~_Why do you think the commander of_~~

~~_Fort McHenry wanted the British to be able to see the flag from far away?_~~


“I read a book about this once,” said Adele. “Mary Pickersgill needed help to

make such a big flag.”


**Show Image 6A-7: Mary Pickersgill and her**

**flag**

“She did indeed,” replied Grandfather Lafitte.

“Her daughter, her two nieces, and a young

apprentice helped. The flag that these five

women made had fifteen stars and fifteen





stripes. When it was finished, the flag was

as large as a house—it was actually bigger

than the room they were making it in! Mary

Pickersgill’s flag measured thirty feet tall by forty-two feet wide. ~~_[If your_~~

Do you know how many stars and stripes our flag has today?” ~~_[Pause for_~~

~~_students to answer.]_~~


“There are thirteen stripes and fifty stars,” J.P. said confidently. “The thirteen

stripes represent the thirteen original colonies, and the stars represent our

fifty states.”


“Excellent!” exclaimed Grandfather Lafitte. “Now let’s get back to the story.


**Show Image 6A-8: British bombing Fort**
**McHenry**

“Before long, the British began firing rockets

at Fort McHenry. At first, the British ships were

too far from the fort for the U.S. soldiers to be

able to return fire. For more than twenty-four





hours, the British pounded the fort. ~~_Twenty-four_~~

~~_hours is one whole day and one whole night._~~



With little return fire, the British ships sailed closer and closer to the fort. Once

they were close enough, though, our soldiers were able to return fire.”


“That must have sounded like a terrible thunderstorm,” said Adele.


“Probably louder than fireworks on the Fourth of July,” added J.P.


“Did we hit any British ships?” asked J.P.


“We sure did,” said Grandfather Lafitte. “In fact, the British ships were forced

to pull back. They kept firing though. However, early the next morning,

the British realized that they had not been able to take over the city. They

stopped the attack and the British ships sailed away. During the night the

fort had flown a smaller flag, but as the British stopped firing and prepared

to sail away, the commander, George Armistead, directed the army to raise

the enormous flag that Mary Pickersgill and her helpers made.” ~~_How do you_~~

~~_think the soldiers in the fort felt as they raised this flag? [Prompt a discussion_~~

~~_about how they would feel proud.]_~~


“Wow!” exclaimed J.P. and Adele together.

“Francis Scott Key wrote our national anthem,” explained J.P.


“That’s right, the events that morning **inspired** Francis Scott Key to write a

poem that later became our national anthem,” added Grandfather Lafitte.

~~_The word_~~ ~~inspired~~ ~~_means to have caused or influenced him to write the poem._~~

1. **Inferential.** Why did the British want to capture the city of Baltimore?
( _Answers may vary, but could include that Baltimore had a deepwater_
_port and was an important trading center. It was also close to New York,_
_Philadelphia, and Washington._ )


2. **Inferential.** Why was it important that Baltimore was a deepwater port?
( _Large ships could more easily move in and out of the port and unload their_
_cargo._ )


3. **Literal.** What did the people of Baltimore and the army do to prepare for the
British invasion of the city? _(They stored supplies, built entrenchments, and_
_sank their own ships in the harbor.)_


4. **Literal.** Why did the commander of Fort McHenry want such a large flag?
( _because he wanted the British to be able to see it from far away_ )

   - What was Mary Pickersgill’s role in the flag flying over Fort McHenry? _(She_

_and several others made the huge flag.)_


5. **Literal.** What was the outcome of the Battle of Baltimore? _(The British failed_
_to take the city, so the United States won the battle.)_


Check for Understanding


**Turn and Talk:** Discuss with your partner what inspired Francis
Scott Key to write “The Star-Spangled Banner.”( _He spent the_
_night of the battle in a boat in the harbor, watching the bombs and_
_rockets fly around the fort. The next morning, he saw the enormous_
_flag still flying over the fort and knew that Fort McHenry/the city of_
_Baltimore had not been captured by the British._ )

~~**WORD WORK: INSPIRED (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “The events [at Fort McHenry] inspired Francis
Scott Key to write a poem that later became our national anthem.”


2. Say the word _inspired_ with me.


3. The word _inspired_ means to think or start something new, to have caused
someone to do or think something, especially something creative.


4. My first-grade teacher inspired me to want to be a teacher.


5. Can you think of someone, in history or from today, perhaps someone you
know, who has inspired you? Try to use the word _inspired_ when you tell about
him or her. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase
the students’ responses: “ has inspired me because . . . ”
or “ inspired me.”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I am going to read sentences
about some people. If the sentence describes someone who was inspired,
say, “S/he was inspired.” If the sentence does not describe someone who
was inspired, say, “S/he was not inspired.”

Unit 4 The War of 1812


Remember, the final part of the British three-part plan was to attack the city

of New Orleans and gain control of the Mississippi River.” ~~_The Mississippi_~~

~~_River is one of the world’s major rivers._~~


**Show Image 7A-2: Map showing Mississippi**

“Was New Orleans an important port, too?”

asked J.P., who had already devoured three

cookies and was now eating an apple.





“It certainly was. It was one of the largest

cities in America, and it was an important

trading center. Farmers could ship their goods down the Mississippi River to

the port of New Orleans. Ships transported these goods far and wide. Not

only that, the Ohio, Missouri, and Tennessee Rivers feed into the Mississippi

River. That means that farmers as far away as Ohio, as well as settlers

moving west, had a way of sending and receiving goods. Important supplies

could be taken all across the United States on what was essentially a series

of water highways.” ~~_Today, how are the things we need transported from place_~~

~~_to place?_~~


“Oh, I see,” said J.P. “If the British captured New Orleans, they would be able

to stop that trade. That would not have been good for the farmers or the

merchants.”

“Now, during the summer of 1814, the British

started building up a larger invasion force.

With the Napoleonic Wars almost over, the British had more soldiers to

spare. They now had more than twice as many soldiers as the Americans.”


“How could we beat such a huge army?” asked J.P., **astonished** . ~~_The word_~~

~~astonished~~ ~~_refers to a feeling of surprise or amazement._~~


“Listen and I’ll tell you all about it,” urged Grandfather Lafitte. “In early

December of 1814, General Andrew Jackson arrived in New Orleans.


**Show Image 7A-5: New Orleans harbor**

“People were in a state of panic. The British

navy had already begun to destroy some of

the city’s defenses. Then, just two days before

Christmas, General Jackson got word that

the British Army was only eight miles from





New Orleans. He ordered the construction

of entrenchments, or defensive walls, across



**108**



the swampy land around the city. He got as many people as he could to dig

these defensive walls.” ~~_In which other American city were entrenchments built_~~

“As it turned out, it really was,” replied Grandfather Lafitte.

“Over the next several days and weeks, there

became known as the Battle of New Orleans,

took place in early January in a wooded area

south of the city. ~~_[Point to New Orleans on the_~~



~~_U.S. map.]_~~ The British were moving toward the city. But what they did not

know was that some of Andrew Jackson’s best soldiers were **strategically**

positioned along the defensive walls that had been built around the city.

~~Strategically~~ ~~_means carefully planned to meet a certain goal._~~ These soldiers

were armed with much better weapons than the British soldiers had. General

Andrew Jackson’s men also had about a dozen cannons.” ~~_The cannons_~~

“Did the British know that they were

outgunned?” asked J.P.


“No, they didn’t—at least not at first,” replied





Grandfather Lafitte. “One group of British

soldiers advanced at dawn across an open

field between the Mississippi River and an area



of swampland. Unfortunately for the British, their commanding officer did

not survive that effort. Without a leader to take the commanding officer’s

place, there was a great deal of confusion on the battlefield. Before long, the

British soldiers realized that they were in trouble.”


“Did they surrender?” inquired Adele. ~~_What does the word_~~ ~~surrender~~ ~~_mean?_~~


**Show Image 7A-8: USS Constitution**

**defeating a British ship**

“Yes, essentially,” agreed Grandfather Lafitte.

“By this time hundreds of British soldiers

had been lost or injured. The British had no

choice. They raised a white flag. ~~_The white_~~





~~_flag is a signal recognized around the world_~~

~~_for surrender, or giving up._~~ As the smoke cleared, the firing stopped. It seems

that one British officer even stepped forward and offered his sword to a U.S.

commanding officer as a sign of **truce** . ~~_A truce is an agreement between sides_~~

~~_to stop fighting._~~ Overall, compared to the British, we lost very few soldiers

in the Battle of New Orleans. The British **retreated**, but they stayed in their

encampment near the battlefield for several more days. ~~Retreated~~ ~~_means_~~

~~_backed away from danger._~~ No more shots were fired by either side. Eventually

the British withdrew their ships and sailed away.


“The Battle of New Orleans was perhaps our greatest victory, but it was not

the last battle of the War of 1812. The last battle was in February 1815, at

Fort Bowyer [/boe*yer/], at the entrance of Mobile Bay near what is now

Alabama. ~~_[Point to Mobile Bay on a U.S. map.]_~~ The British won that battle and

were considering another attack on New Orleans. But, before they did, they

received the news that a peace treaty had been signed in Europe. The war

was officially over.”


“I don’t understand Granddad,” said J.P. “Did you say the war was already

over, but both sides were still fighting?”


“How could that be?” asked Adele.


**Show Image 7A-9: Grandfather and children**

**on the porch**

“Well, I’ll explain,” said Grandfather Lafitte.

“The previous September, after the Battle

of Baltimore, both sides began to work on a

peace treaty. That peace treaty was eventually





signed on Christmas Eve, December, 24, 1814.

But, back then, news traveled very, very slowly.



Support


Have students
discuss forms of
communication that
exist today, but didn’t
exist in 1812, that
would have made
news of the treaty
travel more quickly.



~~_Remember, the Battle of New Orleans was after Christmas._~~ The news of the

peace treaty did not reach the troops in time to prevent the Battle of New

Orleans or the attack on Fort Bowyer.”


“That’s too bad,” said Adele. “Those soldiers wouldn’t have been hurt if they’d

known about the peace treaty,” said Adele.


“Yes, that’s true,” replied Grandfather Lafitte. “But there was a positive effect

from battles such as the Battle of New Orleans. Some historians say the

War of 1812 was America’s second war for independence. That’s because

successful battles like the Battle of New Orleans did help us to believe in

ourselves as a strong nation.”

“What happened after the war?” asked Adele.


“Well, I want to tell you a little about the peace treaty itself, and we mustn’t

forget about those pirates” replied Grandfather.

Laffite to continue.


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Place Image Card 15 (Battle of New Orleans) on the timeline to the right of
the Battle of Baltimore.


1. **Inferential.** Why did the British want to gain control of the Mississippi River?
( _The Mississippi River was a very important trading link and connected many_
_parts of the United States; the British wanted to stop trading and prevent_
_Americans from getting the supplies they needed; etc._ )


2. **Literal.** Two days before Christmas, the British army was just eight miles
from the city of New Orleans. What did General Jackson do when he heard
this? ( _He ordered the construction of entrenchments, or defensive walls,_
_across the swampy land around the city._ )


3. **Literal.** Was the Battle of New Orleans the only battle fought after the war
ended? ( _No, the last battle was fought at Fort Bowyer in Alabama._ )


4. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ The title of this Read-Aloud is “The Battle
After the War.” Is that a good title for this story? Why or why not? Be sure to
provide information from the Read-Aloud to support your opinion. _(Answers_
_may vary, but may be that it is an appropriate title because the Battle of New_
_Orleans took place after the War of 1812 was officially over._ )

to do something, you will find a way to do it.


 - Explain that Andrew Jackson knew that the Battle of New Orleans was a very
important battle. If the British won, they’d gain control of the Mississippi
River. He could not let that happen. He directed that entrenchments be built
around the city and put together an army of militiamen, soldiers, Native
Americans, African Americans, farmers, and even pirates—whatever it took.
He was determined to win.

~~**“PEACE AND PIRATES” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 8A-1: War of 1812 ships**

“The War of 1812 actually lasted almost three

years,” started Grandfather Lafitte. ~~_It started_~~

~~_in 1812 but it wasn’t over until January 1815._~~

“Both sides won battles here and there. The

Americans felt **dejected** when the British





burned Washington, D.C. ~~Dejected~~ ~~_means_~~

~~_very sad._~~ But they felt **jubilant** when they



successfully defended Baltimore and New Orleans.” ~~_If_~~ ~~dejected~~ ~~_means very_~~

~~_sad, what do you think jubilant means? (very happy)_~~


“Who won the War of 1812?” asked J.P.


“That’s a tough question to answer,” replied Grandfather Lafitte. “There

wasn’t an outright winner. However, in many ways, by preventing the British

from capturing several of our key ports, we felt that we had won.”


**Show Image 8A-2: Grandfather and children**

“Did the British think they had won?” Adele

chimed in.





“I don’t know about that. I am sure they felt

that there was no clear winner. There’s no

question that both sides were happy to stop fighting. And Americans were

relieved that the British did not gain any more land in our country. The peace

treaty stated that both sides would have to accept the land agreements that

existed before the war.” ~~_Peace is a time when there is no fighting or war._~~


“That’s good, but I still haven’t heard anything about pirates,” urged J.P.


“Well now you are going to,” Grandfather Lafitte replied. “You see, privateers

and pirates played an important role in the War of 1812.”


**Show Image 8A-3: War of 1812 privateer ship**

“What are privateers? How are they different

from pirates?” asked Adele.


“Privateers were basically government
approved pirates. That means they were





allowed—and sometimes even encouraged—

to stop British merchant ships and take the

cargo. Sometimes they were asked to seize



the ships, too. This was often the only way the United States could get the

supplies we needed.”


Check for Understanding


**Turn and Talk:** Turn to your partner and explain one way pirates
and privateers are the same. Then your partner should turn to you
and explain one way pirates and privateers are different.


“Do you mean to say that President Madison told privateers to steal stuff?”

asked J.P., amazed at the thought.


“Well,” said Grandfather Lafitte, “many things happen in times of war that

would not ordinarily happen. Back then, there were more privateers who

owned ships than there were U.S. naval ships and sailors. For a big part of

the war, the British had blockaded many of our ports. We had no way to get

supplies. We could not trade with other nations. We needed all the help we

could get. So these privateers helped us by taking merchant ships and cargo

that we desperately needed. ~~_If they desperately needed supplies do you think_~~


Lesson 8 Peace and Pirates
**121**


~~_that means they needed them very badly or not at all?_~~ By the end of the War

of 1812, there were several hundred perfectly legal American privateers!”


“Were the privateers pirates before the war?” asked J.P.


**Show Image 8A-4: Portrait of Jean Lafitte**

“Some privateers were pirates,” Grandfather

Lafitte replied. “But others were young

men who saw it as a way to make money.

The most famous, or shall we say, infamous,

pirates-turned-privateers from that time





were two brothers named Jean

[/zhon/] and Pierre [/pyaer/] Lafitte.”

Grandfather paused. ~~Infamous~~ ~~_means to_~~

~~_be famous, or well-known, for being bad._~~

“Jean Lafitte was an excellent sailor and **navigator** . ~~_A navigator is a person_~~

~~_who finds out how to get to a place._~~ He helped spy on the British when they

began their attack on New Orleans. Pierre was an expert smuggler of stolen

goods. ~~_A smuggler is someone who takes things illegally to another place._~~

Because they had been pirates, they knew the swamps and bayous of New

Orleans very well. ~~_A bayou is a slow-moving body of water, filled with plants,_~~

~~_found in low-lying areas._~~ Jean in particular could find his way around the

dense, jungle-like swamps that confused most people.


Jean even created secret waterways and canals that only he and his fellow

pirates knew about. They could escape from anyone who tried to capture

them. They hid their stolen goods in these secret places, too.

“They knew the area so well that General

Andrew Jackson asked them to help him

defend New Orleans. He offered them a full

pardon if they agreed. ~~Pardon~~ ~~_means to forgive_~~





~~_legally so that the act or acts committed are no_~~

people believe that Andrew Jackson would not have won the Battle of New

Orleans without the help of Jean Lafitte.”


Unit 4 The War of 1812


“Wait. Did you say Jean . . . Lafitte?” asked Adele, staring right at her brother,

whose full name was Jean-Pierre. ~~_Adele’s brother’s name is Jean-Pierre, and_~~

~~_their last name is Lafitte. What do you think that means?_~~


“Are we related to Jean Lafitte?!” gasped J.P.


“We are, it seems, descendants of his brother Pierre,” explained Grandfather

Lafitte. “I will tell you a little more about your namesakes. They were quite

fascinating characters.”


Now Grandfather had the children’s attention.


“No one knows for certain where Jean and Pierre Lafitte were born,” began

Grandfather Lafitte. “Some believe that they were born in France, others that

they were born in the French colony of Saint-Domingue. ~~_Saint-Domingue_~~

~~_is now known as Haiti. It was once controlled by France and was the richest_~~

~~_island in the Caribbean._~~ Pierre was the older of the two, and they think he

was probably born in 1770, whereas Jean was born around 1776. But no one

knows for sure.”


**Show Image 8A-6: Map of Barataria island**

“Both of the brothers were well-educated. In

fact, Jean spoke at least four languages. The

Lafittes were such good pirates that they had

a warehouse in New Orleans filled with stolen

goods. At one point, the brothers took over a

whole island in Barataria Bay, Louisiana. ~~_[Point_~~

~~_to Barataria on the map.]_~~ They called the



island ‘The Temple.’ This island was like a settlement full of smugglers and

pirates. And Jean Lafitte was their leader. The pirates sold their stolen goods

right there on the island, and everyone went there to shop—the rich and the

famous, and even everyday farmers.”


“That’s so interesting,” exclaimed J.P., listening, spellbound by his

grandfather’s story.


“You could say that,” laughed Grandfather Lafitte. “As the war moved into

their hometown, they used their secret waterways in the swamps and bayous

to keep a close eye on the British. Despite Jean Lafitte’s best efforts, the

British eventually found his island. They seized his fleet of pirate ships and all

the treasures he and his brother had stored there.”



Lesson 8 Peace and Pirates
**123**


“Did the British capture Jean and Pierre, too?” wondered J.P.


“No, the brothers weren’t on the island at the time,” Grandfather Lafitte

replied.


**Show Image 8A-7: Picture of Jean Lafitte’s**
**blacksmith shop** ~~_This is a photograph of a_~~
~~_building that is believed to have been used by the_~~
~~_Lafitte brothers as a New Orleans base for their_~~

“Jean and Pierre Lafitte never thought of





themselves as pirates. They considered

themselves loyal **patriots** and businessmen.

~~_A patriot is someone who loves his or her_~~



~~_country._~~ But it’s been pretty well documented that, with the help of Jean,

Pierre, and their army of buccaneers, Andrew Jackson knew every move

the British made. Thanks to them, he was able to outsmart and outgun the

British!” ~~_Jean commanded an army of hundreds of buccaneers, or pirates._~~


“Wow! Our **ancestors** sure played an important role in winning the Battle

of New Orleans! I can’t wait to tell my friends about this,” exclaimed J.P.

~~_Ancestors are people in your family from a long time ago._~~


“I hope you’ll also tell them all you’ve learned about the War of 1812,” said

Grandfather Lafitte. “You are now both experts on the subject. I’m sure your

teacher will be very impressed with your new knowledge.”


“Granddad, you never told us what is in your journal,” prodded Adele. She had

been curious about Grandfather’s journal ever since she noticed it when they

first arrived.


**Show Image 8A-8: Illustration of poster and**

**the journal**

Grandfather Lafitte opened up the leather

journal. Attached to the first page was a very

old, crinkled poster. He carefully unfolded the

yellowing page.





**124**



“The Lafitte brothers advertised their stolen

goods on posters and billboards in New

Orleans. This is one of the posters. It may even have been held in the hands

of Jean and Pierre Lafitte,” said Grandfather Lafitte.


Unit 4 The War of 1812


J.P. and Adele looked at the poster. It read:


_COME ONE! COME ALL! TO JEAN LAFITTE’S BAZAAR SATURDAY. FOR_
_YOUR DELIGHT: CLOTHING, GEMS, AND KNICK-KNACKS FROM THE_
_SEVEN SEAS_


The children read the poster several times. They both gently touched the

delicate, old document. Then, Grandfather Lafitte folded it up and tucked it

back inside the journal.


**Show Image 8A-9: Illustration of J.P. and**

**Adele running home**

“Now, I suggest you two scallywags skedaddle.

~~_Scallywags is a silly nickname Grandfather_~~

~~_Lafitte has for the children. Telling someone to_~~

~~_skedaddle is a nice or silly way of telling them_~~





~~_to go away._~~ Take some time to think about all

the things you have learned. As I always say, if



we know something about the past, we can do a better job with the future.”

~~_What do you think Grandfather means by that?_~~


With that, J.P. and Adele hugged their grandfather good-bye and ran all the

way home. The grassy fields in front of their grandfather’s farmhouse were

now bathed in late afternoon sunshine.


“We are related to pirates, Adele,” J.P. said in a loud whisper to his sister as

the two raced excitedly home.


“I know,” whispered Adele. “I just don’t know if we should tell anyone.” ~~_What_~~

helped the United States during the War of 1812.


Unit 4 The War of 1812


~~**WORD WORK: DEJECTED AND JUBILANT (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “The Americans felt dejected when the British
burned Washington, D.C.”


2. Say the word _dejected_ with me.


3. _Dejected_ means very sad.


4. The small puppy looked dejected when the bigger dog got the ball.


5. Have you ever felt dejected or known someone who felt dejected? Try to
use the word _dejected_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students.
If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses: “I felt dejected
when . . . ”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use an Antonyms activity for follow-up.** You have heard that the word
_dejected_ means very sad. In the Read-Aloud you also heard, “But [the
Americans] felt jubilant when they successfully defended Baltimore and
New Orleans.” The word _jubilant_ means very happy, so it is an antonym, or
opposite, of the word _dejected_ .


Now, I am going to read several sentences. If I describe something that
might make someone feel sad, say, “They would feel dejected.” If I describe
something that might make someone very happy, say, “They would feel
jubilant!”


   - After searching the neighborhood for hours, the children still could not find

their dog. ( _They would feel dejected._ )


   - On the last day of school, the kids were excited for summer break. ( _They_
_would feel jubilant!_ )


   - The children’s lost dog came home all by itself! ( _They would feel jubilant!_ )


   - The baseball team won the championship in extra innings! ( _They would_
_feel jubilant!_ )


   - The opposing baseball team lost the championship after extra innings.
( _They would feel dejected._ )



Support


Have students
demonstrate what
a person might look
like if they are feeling
dejected or if they are
feeling jubilant.


Challenge


Create a horizontal word
wall, writing the word
_dejected_ on the extreme
left and the word
_jubilant_ on the extreme
right of a horizontal
line. Next, ask students
to brainstorm other
words that describe
happiness and sadness
(e.g., _happy_, _glad_,
_joyful_, _upbeat_, _cheerful_ ;
_sad_, _blue_, _down_, _glum_,
_unhappy_ ). Place
the words along the
horizontal word wall in
the proper relationship
to the end words,
_dejected_ and _jubilant_ .
You may choose to do
this activity as a whole
group, or have students
complete it individually
or in small groups.

Unit 4 The War of 1812



**134**


**Grade 2 | Unit 4**
#### Culminating Activities


~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


Please use this final day to address class results of the Unit Assessment. Based on
the results of the Unit Assessment, you may wish to use this class time to provide
remediation opportunities that target specific areas of weakness for individual
students, small groups, or the whole class.


Alternatively, you may also choose to use this class time to extend or enrich
students’ experience with unit knowledge. A number of enrichment activities are
provided in this section in order to provide students with opportunities to enliven
their experiences with unit concepts.


~~**REMEDIATION**~~


You may choose to regroup students according to particular areas of
weakness, as indicated from Unit Assessment results.


Remediation opportunities include:


  - targeting Review Activities


  - revisiting lesson Applications


  - rereading and discussing select Read-Alouds


  - reading the corresponding lesson in the Language Studio, if available


Culminating Activities
**135**


~~**ENRICHMENT**~~


**You Were There: The Attacks on Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, and**
**the Battle of New Orleans**

 - Have students pretend that they were at one of the important events during
the War of 1812.







Ask students to describe what they saw and heard. For example, for the

“The Attack on Washington, D.C.,” students may talk about seeing the
British soldiers burn the President’s House, hearing the soldiers talk about
eating the meal that Dolley Madison left on the table, or seeing the painting
of George Washington being rescued. For the “The Attack on Baltimore,”
students may talk about seeing the rockets’ red glare, hearing the bombs
bursting in air, or the feeling of seeing the giant flag that Mary Pickersgill
made flying over Fort McHenry.



**136**




 - Consider also extending this activity by adding group or independent writing

opportunities associated with the “You Were There” concept. For example,
ask students to pretend they are newspaper reporters describing the Battle
of New Orleans and how it took place after the war was officially over.


**A Picture Gallery of America in 1812: Art Gallery and Portfolios**


Materials: Posterboard; tape; hole punch; ribbon

 - Tell students that a gallery is a place where people go to look at paintings or
other forms of artwork. Explain that a portfolio is a collection of drawings,
paintings, or photographs presented in a folder. Tell students that they are
going to make their own portfolios to save the artwork they created to show
America in 1812. (You may also want to create a special gallery space in the
classroom or hallway to display some of students’ artwork.)


 - Directions to make a portfolio for each student: Fold a piece of posterboard

(22" x 28") in half. Tape the sides of the posterboard with colored duct
tape. To make carrying handles, hole punch two holes centered at the top,
approximately 5 inches apart. Knot a piece of grosgrain ribbon (about 12"
long) into each side. (You may also use file folders, duct-taped along the
side.)


Unit 4 The War of 1812


**Class Book: The War of 1812**


Materials: Drawing paper, drawing tools

  - Tell the class or a group of students that they are going to make a class book
to help them remember what they have learned about the War of 1812. Have
students brainstorm important information about what the British were
doing to U.S. ships and sailors, British relationships with Native Americans,
James and Dolley Madison, and the USS _Constitution_ . Have each student
choose one idea to draw a picture of and then write a caption for the picture.
Bind the pages to make a book to put in the class library for students to read
again and again.


  - Another option is to create an ABC book where students brainstorm unitrelated words for each letter of the alphabet.


**Song: “The Star-Spangled Banner”**


Materials: Recording of the song “The Star-Spangled Banner”

  - Have students listen to the recording of “The Star-Spangled Banner” again.
Students may talk about the content of the song or how the song makes
them feel. Encourage students to use unit vocabulary they have learned
when sharing their ideas. Students may also draw a pictorial representation
of the song.


Culminating Activities
**137**


**138**



**Using a Map**


Materials: U.S. map

 - Use a map of the United States to review various locations from the ReadAlouds. Prompt students with questions such as the following:


   - What was Great Britain’s three-part plan of attack? _(move into New York_
_from the north; attack Washington, D.C., and Baltimore; take control of New_
_Orleans)_


   - Why did the British attack Washington, D.C.? _(That is where the President’s_
_House was located.)_


   - Why did the British attack Baltimore? _(because it was a deep water port)_


   - Why did the British attack New Orleans? _(to gain control over the_
_Mississippi River)_
