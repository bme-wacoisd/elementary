This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching the _Cycles_
_of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops_ unit. The Teacher Guide for _Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops_
contains nine daily lessons, each of which is composed of two distinct parts, so that the lesson may
be divided into smaller chunks of time and presented at different intervals during the day. Each
entire lesson will require a total of sixty minutes.


This unit includes a two-day Pausing Point following Lesson 5. At the end of the unit, a Unit Review, a
Unit Assessment, and Culminating Activities are included to allow time to review, reinforce, assess,
and remediate content knowledge. You should spend no more than fourteen days total on this unit.

~~**WHY CYCLES OF NATURE ARE IMPORTANT**~~


This unit will introduce your students to the many natural cycles that make life on Earth possible.
Your students will increase their knowledge of cycles of nature by learning more about seasonal
cycles, and by beginning their study of flowering plants and trees, animal life cycles, and the
importance of the water cycle. Students will also learn about the effect seasonal changes have on
plants and animals. As students learn that all organisms experience the developmental stages of the
life cycle, they will also learn how their growth and development relates to Earth’s seasonal cycles
and begin to understand how all organisms depend on Earth’s limited water supply.


The text that students will be reading and discussing in this unit provides opportunities for
students to build content knowledge and draw connections to science. You may build on class
discussions to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of Earth
and Space, Organisms and Environments, Scientific and Engineering Practices, and Recurring
Themes and Concepts from the Science TEKS. This content is not a replacement for grade-level
science instruction. For more information about the quantitative and qualitative measures used
to determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher
Resources.


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED**~~


The following units are particularly relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _Cycles_
_of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops_ . This background knowledge will greatly enhance students’
understanding of the Read-Alouds they are about to enjoy:


**Plants: How Do They Grow? (Kindergarten)**


**Seasons and Weather: As the Earth Turns (Kindergarten)**


**Astronomy: Space Exploration (Grade 1)**


**Animals and Habitats: The World We Share (Grade 1)**


Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops


~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR CYCLES OF NATURE: CLOUDS TO RAINDROPS**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops
in the forms in which they appear in the Read-Alouds. Boldfaced words in the list have an associated
Word Work activity. The inclusion of the words on this list does not mean that students are
immediately expected to be able to use all of these words on their own. However, through repeated
exposure throughout the lessons, they should acquire a good understanding of most of these words
and begin to use some of them in conversation.

~~**LESSON AT A GLANCE**~~


Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Application**

  - Locate a globe, preferably a globe mounted on a stand at an angle that

allows it to rotate, for the Observing Earth’s Movement activity. This activity
requires light and shadow created by a flashlight, which may require a
fairly dark room. Practice the Observing Earth’s Movement activity in your
classroom to ensure that you can adequately demonstrate light and shadow
with the flashlight. You may need to plan to conduct this activity in a darker
classroom or even with small groups in a closet to get the full effect of the
light and shadow.


  - Prepare an Observations Board where you can record the dictated scientific
observations of students. You may wish to use a piece of chart paper with the
title “Observations: Cycles of Nature,” or you may wish to create a bulletin
board on which you can post class observations throughout the unit. You
will use this Observations Board in Lessons 1, 2, and 9, but you should also
encourage students to add their own written, drawn, or oral observations at
any time.


  - The demonstration planned for the Lesson 9 Application activity will take
time because evaporation and condensation must occur. You may wish to
prepare for this activity in this lesson and have students make observations
during the unit. (See Lesson 9 for details.)


**Universal Access**

  - If possible, locate and borrow several globes so that small groups of students

have access to a globe for the first three Read-Alouds.


  - Plan to use a camera (without a flash) to document the demonstration
during the Application activity.

**Earth’s Rotation and Revolution**

 - Ask students if they can feel the earth moving. Tell them that even though
they cannot feel the earth moving, it is moving very quickly in two different
ways.


 - Lead students in a discussion about what they remember about the two ways
that Earth moves from the Grade 1 _Astronomy_ unit:


   - Earth rotates, or spins around, on its axis.

   - Earth also revolves, or moves in a path around, the sun.


 - Tell students they are going to learn over the next few lessons how these two
types of movement are directly related to the cycle of daytime and nighttime
as well as to the cycle of the four seasons.


 - Discuss with students what they experience when it is daytime and when
it is nighttime. Have them use their five senses to describe the differences
between daytime and nighttime. Tell students today they will learn why they
experience daytime and nighttime on Earth.


**Abbreviations**

 - You may wish to use this opportunity to introduce the abbreviations for days
of the week and months of the year.


 - Display the word _Monday_ and the abbreviation _Mon._ Point to _Monday_ and
say, “An abbreviation is a short way to write a full word. It usually begins
with a capital letter and ends with a period. Types of words that may be
abbreviated include days of the week, months of the year, titles before
names, measurements, streets in addresses, and states. For example, the
word _Monday_ can be written in a shorter form as a capital _M_ and _on_ with a
period at the end.” [Point to _Mon._ ]


 - Display the following words: Jan., Sept., Fri., Sat. Have the students work in
small groups to decode the words and identify the long form of each of the
words. Provide assistance as needed. Then have students write the current
date, including the day of the week, month, day, and year.

~~**“THE CYCLE OF DAYTIME AND NIGHTTIME” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 1A-1: Things that go round and**

**round**

A **cycle** is like a circle that goes around and

around. Just like there are circular objects that

go around and around, there are also many

natural cycles that occur on Earth that happen





again and again, too. A cycle is a sequence of

events that repeats itself again and again. Just

|**1A-1**|**1A-1**||



like you can pick any part of the circle to be the starting point, we choose one

part of each natural cycle to be our starting point. This makes it easier to talk

about all of the parts of the cycle. The most important thing to remember is

that cycles always come back to the chosen starting point before starting over

again. ~~_Stand up and face the blackboard. Spin around in a circle until you come_~~

~~_back to facing the blackboard. You’ve just come back to your starting point!_~~


**Show Image 1A-2: Living things and their**

All living things are part of a cycle of life that

keeps going around and around. What does

this mean? It means that almost all living

things are born, grow, reproduce (or make

babies), and eventually die. The reproduction

of living things is one way that life continues

guess what cycle happens when our part of Earth faces the sun and then rotates

to face away from the sun? Did you guess the cycle of daytime and nighttime?


The cycle of daytime and nighttime is the result of our planet **rotating**,

or spinning, around on an imaginary line called an **axis** . ~~_[Point to the axis_~~

~~_in the image.]_~~ What’s an axis? Well, imagine a spinning basketball turning

around and around. Then try to picture an imaginary line running through the

basketball, from the bottom to the top. That imaginary line is what we call

an axis. ~~_Try to imagine an invisible line running through our body from head_~~

~~_to foot—a central line, or axis, around which we can spin._~~ Earth’s axis passes

through the North and South Poles. It takes twenty-four hours for Earth to

rotate, or spin, one time on its axis.


**Show Image 1A-4: Earth rotating on its axis**

Rotation is the movement of Earth on its



on Earth. A life cycle includes each **stage** that a living thing goes through

from birth to adult. ~~_Here the word_~~ ~~stage~~ ~~_means a particular time in the growth_~~

~~_of something._~~ You will hear a lot more about life cycles later in this unit. First,

there are other cycles of nature that make life on Earth possible, too.


**Show Image 1A-3: Spinning**

Earth spins around and around, a never-ending

cycle that shapes everything we do here on Earth.

~~_The earth is constantly moving. Can we feel the_~~

~~_earth moving?_~~ As Earth turns around, part of it

faces the sun and part of it faces away from the





sun. ~~_Remember, the sun is a star that provides_~~

~~_light, heat, and energy for the earth._~~ Can you

axis. This controls the cycle of daytime and

nighttime. Earth takes twenty-four hours to

turn, or rotate, back to the position from which

it started. Rotation takes us from daytime to

nighttime, and back to the very beginning of

daytime again, before the cycle starts over.



**14**



As Earth rotates, light from the sun falls on one half of Earth. We call this

daytime. The other half of Earth is in darkness, and we call this nighttime.

As Earth continues to rotate, the part of Earth that had sunlight moves into

darkness, and the part that had darkness moves into the sunlight. This is a

never-ending cycle of daytime and nighttime.


Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops


**Show Image 1A-5: Sunrise**

The cycle of daytime and nighttime begins

with sunrise in the early morning. Sunlight hits

our planet and moves across Earth from east

to west. When we see the sun rising in the east

in the morning and setting in the west in the

evening, it is because of the earth rotating,

or spinning. For people on Earth, it makes



sense to say that the sun rises in the morning. Each morning at dawn, the

sun appears in the eastern sky on the horizon. The horizon is the line we see

in the distance where the ground meets the sky. At dawn, some people say,

“Look! The sun is coming up!” ~~_Is the sun really moving or “coming up?”_~~ ~~(No)~~

~~_What is actually happening?_~~ ~~(The earth is moving, but to us it looks like the~~

~~sun is moving.)~~ This first appearance of the sun above the eastern horizon is

called sunrise.


**Show Image 1A-6: Sunset**

Over the course of the day, the sun appears

to move across the sky, gradually following

its path from east to west. In the evening, the

sun sets in the west. Ever so slowly, it appears

lower in the sky and disappears below the

horizon. That’s when people say, “The sun is

going down.” ~~_Is the sun really going down? Why_~~



~~_can’t we see it anymore?_~~ This disappearance of the sun below the western

horizon is called sunset.


Based on what we can see from where we live on Earth, it seems sensible

to say that the sun moves across the sky each day—rising, or moving up, in

the east; and setting, or sinking down, in the west. But that’s not actually

true. It is the daily rotation, or spin, of the earth that makes the sun appear

to rise and set each day. ~~_Have you seen a sunset recently? How would you_~~

~~_describe it?_~~


**Show Image 1A-7: Children sleeping and**
**children waking up**

This daily rotation explains why there is always

daytime and nighttime on Earth. As it spins,

certain parts of Earth’s surface face the sun,

receiving its heat and light. When it is light on





one side of Earth, it is dark on the other side.



Lesson 1 The Cycle of Daytime and Nighttime

~~**ELPS 4.G; ELPS 4.I**~~


**16**



So, if it is daytime where you are right now, then on the other side of the

earth it is nighttime, and the children there are sound asleep. And, when you

are nestled in your bed tonight, children on the other side of the planet will

be waking up to a bright new day. ~~_[Show students where they live on a globe.]_~~

~~_Is it day or night right now where we live?_~~ ~~(daytime)~~ ~~_[Show students a location_~~

~~_on the other side of the globe.] Is it day or night right now on the other side of_~~

~~_the world?_~~ ~~(nighttime)~~


How does the cycle of daytime and nighttime affect living things on Earth?

The sun is extremely important to life on Earth. All plants, animals, and

people rely on the sun in order to **thrive**, or grow well. The sun’s energy gives

life to plants, which in turn nourish animals and people. ~~_When you nourish_~~

~~_something, you provide it with what it needs to grow._~~ The sun’s heat keeps

the surface of Earth warm enough for plants and animals to survive. In the

next few lessons, we will learn all about how the sun affects living things

throughout the four seasons.


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.6.G**~~


1. Literal. What is the main topic of the Read-Aloud, or what does this ReadAloud explain? ( _This Read-Aloud explains the cycle of daytime and nighttime._ )


2. Literal. What is a cycle? ( _A cycle is a sequence of events that happens over_
_and over again._ )


3. Literal. What causes daytime and nighttime? ( _Rotation of Earth causes_
_daytime and nighttime._ )


Check for Understanding


**Turn and Talk:** How does the rotation of Earth cause daytime and
nighttime? (During rotation, the earth spins on its axis. The part
of Earth that faces the sun changes during rotation, giving some
parts of Earth daytime and some parts of Earth nighttime.)


4. Evaluative. _Think-Pair-Share:_ How would life on Earth be different if Earth
did not rotate? ( _Answers may vary._ )


**TEKS 2.6.G** Evaluate details read to determine key ideas.

on which people dance, sing, and act. Look at the two pictures. In the
Read-Aloud you heard, “A life cycle includes each stage that a living thing
goes through from birth to adult.”


  - Have students hold up one or two fingers to indicate which image on the
poster shows this meaning.


    - Stage also means a raised platform on which people sing, dance, and act.

    - 1 Finger: a particular point or period in the growth or development of
something


    - _2 Fingers: a raised platform in a theater, auditorium, etc., where the_
_performers stand._


  - Have students hold up one or two fingers to indicate which image on the

**Lesson 1: The Cycle of Daytime and Nighttime**
20M
##### Application


**Reading:** Students will observe and describe how the rotation of the earth causes
daytime and nighttime.


~~**TEKS 2.1.D; TEKS 2.6.E**~~


~~**OBSERVING EARTH’S MOVEMENT**~~


**Rotation: Day and Night**

  - Tell students you are going to do a demonstration that allows them to make
observations of the earth rotating and the cycle of daytime and nighttime.


  - Show students the Observations Board you created in advance and read
the title, “Observations: Cycles of Nature.” Tell students you will record your
observations as a class on this board after the demonstration. Tell students
you will be using the Observations Board to record observations throughout
the unit. Encourage students to make relevant observations about cycles of
nature at any time.


  - Show students a globe, pointing out the United States and Texas. Have a
student place a sticker where Texas is on the globe.


  - Show students the tilt of the globe and remind them that the earth’s axis is
tilted and always points in the same direction (to the right).


  - Point to the tips of the globe’s axis and ask:


    - What is the name of the imaginary central line around which the earth
spins, or rotates? _(axis)_


  - Darken the room. Ask a volunteer to point the flashlight at the globe from a
single horizontal point. Tell students that the flashlight represents the sun.


  - Rotate the globe counterclockwise if you are looking down at the North Pole
to demonstrate rotation. Rotate the globe until the sticker marking your town
is directly in the path of the light.


  - **Observation 1:** Help students observe that when it is daytime in your town,
your town is in the path of light from the sun and that when it is daytime in
your town, it is nighttime on the opposite side of the Earth.


  - Then slowly spin the globe counterclockwise until your town is in complete
shadow.


**TEKS 2.1.D** Work collaboratively with others to follow agreed-upon rules for discussion, including listening to others, speaking
when recognized, making appropriate contributions, and building on the ideas of others; **TEKS 2.6.E** Make connections to
personal experiences, ideas in other texts, and society.

Note that the four seasons discussed in Lessons 2 and 3 might not have
the same characteristics as the seasons you and your students experience
in Texas. Be sure to read Lessons 2 and 3 ahead of time and plan your
discussion of seasons to include information relevant to students’ daily
experiences. If you live in a part of Texas with milder seasonal changes, think
about how you might teach about both milder seasons and the more distinct
seasonal changes depicted in the Read-Alouds in Lessons 2 and 3.

~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION OR TERMS (5 MIN.)**~~


**Seasons**

 - Discuss the seasons you experience in Texas.


 - Tell students that different people all over the world experience the seasons
in different ways, but that today you will be discussing the seasons people in
the Northern Hemisphere, where you live, experience.


 - Ask a student to point to your approximate location on the globe.


**Rotation and Revolution**

 - Have students sit in a circle around you.


 - Prompt students to remember that Earth’s rotation causes the cycle of
daytime and nighttime.


   - What is the word that describes how the earth moves on its axis?

_(rotation)_


 - Stand in the center of students and tell students you are the sun. You may
wish to create a “sun hat” or hold a picture of the sun.


 - Tell students they are going to be little Earths. Have students stand up and
show you how Earth rotates on its axis.


 - Then, tell students when they are facing the sun (you), they should say,
“Daytime!” When their backs are to the sun, they should say, “Nighttime!”
After you have completed the activity, have students sit down.


 - Tell students Earth moves in another way, called revolution. The earth moves,
or revolves, in an almost circular path around the sun. Earth makes one
revolution, or orbit, around the sun about every 365 days, or every year.


 - Ask one student to stand and be the earth. Have the student walk in a circle
around you. Tell students the earth is revolving around the sun. Though the
student who is playing Earth cannot both rotate and revolve around the
sun, remind students that when the earth revolves around the sun, it is also
rotating.

~~**“THE REASONS FOR SEASONS” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 2A-1: Earth rotating on its axis**

Right now, Earth is moving! Even though you

cannot feel it, Earth is always moving in space

in two ways. The first way the earth moves is

called rotation. Rotation is the movement of

Earth around its axis. This controls the cycle





of daytime and nighttime. The Earth takes

twenty-four hours to turn, or rotate, once on



its axis. The earth rotates in a counterclockwise direction from daytime to

nighttime and back to daytime again. ~~Counterclockwise~~ ~~_means to move in the_~~

~~_opposite direction from the hands on a clock. [Demonstrate counterclockwise_~~

~~_for students.]_~~ During rotation, the part of Earth that is facing the sun

changes. When it is daytime in Texas, that means that the part of the earth

on which you are standing is facing the sun. Sunlight hits our planet and

moves across it from east to west. This is why we see the sun rising in the

east and setting in the west. Sunset eventually occurs when certain parts

of Earth turn, or rotate, away from the sun, and nighttime begins. This cycle

continues over and over again. ~~_Stand up and turn or rotate one time moving_~~


**TEKS 2.6.G** Evaluate details read to determine key ideas; **TEKS 2.7.F** Respond using newly acquired vocabulary as
appropriate; **TEKS 2.9.D.ii** Recognize characteristics and structures of informational text, including features and graphics to

Using the globe, model
the earth revolving
around the sun while
rotating.



~~_in a counterclockwise direction. Your full rotation models the earth’s rotation_~~

~~_as it completes one full twenty-four hour cycle._~~


**Show Image 2A-2: Diagram of Earth revolving**
**around the sun**

The second way the earth moves is called

revolution. Earth **revolves**, or orbits, around

the sun in an almost circular path. Therefore,

as you live on Earth, you are traveling around





the sun, too. It takes Earth 365¼ days—or one

year—to complete one revolution, or orbit. You



might be wondering about the ¼ of a day. This ¼ explains why we have a leap

year every four years. ~~_Four quarters equal one whole, or one whole number,_~~

~~_just like four quarters equal one dollar._~~ During a leap year, we add on one

additional day to the calendar to catch it up to Earth’s orbit around the sun.

~~_We add one day in February, February 29, every four years._~~


Earth is tilted as it orbits the sun. **Tilt**, or slant, your head to one side.

The earth remains at this same angle and points in the same direction

throughout its entire orbit. Now let’s find out more about how Earth’s tilt

causes the seasonal cycle.


**Show Image 2A-3: Orange cut into halves and**

**Earth cut into hemispheres**

Earth is divided into **hemispheres**, or

halves. Just like an orange can be cut in

half either through the center from side to

side or from the top to the bottom, Earth





can also be divided two different ways. Our

planet is divided in half into the Northern



**28**



and Southern Hemispheres by an imaginary line on its surface called the

**equator** . The equator is the same distance from the North Pole as it is from

the South Pole. The United States, where we live, is located in the Northern

Hemisphere. Earth can also be divided into two halves called the Eastern and

Western Hemispheres. These hemispheres are divided by the Prime Meridian

[/m ə *rid*ee*en/], an imaginary line used to split Earth into eastern and

western halves. ~~_[Locate the equator, the North Pole, the South Pole, and the_~~

~~_Prime Meridian on the globe for students.]_~~


Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops


**Show Image 2A-4: Northern summer**

When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted

toward the sun during Earth’s revolution

around the sun, it receives more intense light

from the sun at a more direct angle. ~~_[Shine_~~

~~_a light on the tilted globe to demonstrate_~~

~~_the more direct angle of intense sunlight.]_~~

During this time, it is summer in the Northern



Hemisphere. Around June 21 each year, the sun reaches its highest point

overhead in the Northern Hemisphere. This is called the summer solstice

[/ sol*stis/] and is referred to as the longest day of the year. That means that

there is daylight for a longer period of time on that day than on any other day

of the year. ~~_[Direct students’ attention to the graphic. What are the features in_~~

~~_this graphic? What is the purpose of the arrows? Why is there both a diagram_~~

~~_and a photograph?]_~~ ~~**TEKS 2.9.D.ii**~~


People in the Southern Hemisphere are experiencing winter while people in

the Northern Hemisphere are experiencing summer. Around June 21 in the

Southern Hemisphere, that part of Earth is tilted away from the sun, with

the sun at a low angle in the sky. The sunlight is not as strong or as intense,

and there is less of it, so that part of Earth receives less light and less energy

than the Northern Hemisphere. June 21, plus or minus one day, is the winter

solstice, or shortest day of the year, in the Southern Hemisphere. It is the

opposite of the Northern Hemisphere. ~~_North and south are opposites. They_~~

~~_are opposite directions._~~


**Show Image 2A-5: Northern winter**

As Earth revolves around the sun, the

seasons begin to change depending on which

hemisphere is tilted most directly toward

Before revealing that
summer is the season
when the Northern
Hemisphere is tilted
toward the sun, ask
students to try to infer
which season it might be.







the sun. This depends on where Earth is

on its revolution, or orbit, around the sun.

One revolution takes one year, and each

hemisphere is tilted directly in the sun for part



of the year. Six months after the longest day in the Northern Hemisphere,

the shortest day occurs. The winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere

is around December 21. This is, of course, the longest day of the year, or

summer solstice, in the Southern Hemisphere. They are opposites!

gain information.


Lesson 2 The Reasons for Seasons
**29**


**Show Image 2A-6: Northern spring and fall**

When Earth is halfway between the two

solstices, both hemispheres receive the same

amount of sunlight. This means that the hours

of daylight and of darkness are the same in

each hemisphere. The days that are equal are

called equinoxes. The spring equinox occurs at

the beginning of spring around March 21. The



autumn equinox occurs at the beginning of autumn around September 21.


The cycle of one complete orbit or revolution of Earth around the sun marks

or measures one year. Living things respond to the changes in sunlight and

warmth throughout the four seasons of the year. With increased sunlight

and warmth during spring and summer, many living things tend to grow well.

Animals are born and plants grow. With decreased sunlight during autumn

and winter, some plants are ready to be harvested, whereas others die. Some

become dormant, or stop growing and making new leaves for the winter, and

wait for the sunlight to return. You will see that most trees do this in the fall

and winter. Some animals, to avoid the winter chill, hibernate or migrate.

When animals migrate, they move to warmer environments. ~~_Think of two_~~

~~_words that describe each season._~~


**Show Image 2A-7: Light hitting Earth**

Not every part of Earth experiences four

different seasons. Different areas of Earth

have different types of weather. This is partly

because of the shape and tilt of our planet.

This means that different parts of Earth





receive different amounts of sunlight and

warmth. The area around the equator receives



**30**



the greatest amount of direct intense sunlight, so some of the warmest parts

of Earth are located in that part of the planet. The North and South Poles are

at opposite ends of our planet, and they receive the least direct sunlight. In

fact, although they are so far apart, they have the same kind of weather as

each other. It is always cold in the North and South Poles, and both places

are usually covered with ice.

 - Throughout this demonstration, walk counterclockwise around the student

holding the flashlight while, if possible, rotating the globe counterclockwise.


**Position 1: Northern Winter**

 - Ask a volunteer to stand in the middle and point the flashlight at the globe
while you hold it steady in Position 1 (Northern Winter). Say: “When the
North Pole is tilted away from the sun, the northern half of the earth does
not receive as much direct sunlight; we have fewer daylight hours. When our
daylight hours decrease, the temperatures become colder.


 - **Observation 1:** Which season is it when the Northern Hemisphere is
tilted away from the sun and we have fewer daylight hours and colder
temperatures?” _(winter)_


**Position 2: Northern Spring**

 - Ask another volunteer to stand in the middle and point the flashlight at
the globe, turning and keeping the light on the globe while you revolve
counterclockwise a quarter of the way around and stop at Position 2
(Northern Spring). Say: “The tilted earth has continued to orbit the sun,
and it is now spring. The daylight hours begin to increase. When daylight
hours increase, the temperatures become warmer. Notice how the Northern
Hemisphere is not really tilted toward or away from the sun.


 - **Observation 2:** Which season follows winter when we begin to have more
daylight hours and warmer temperatures?” _(spring)_

 - Tell students that you are now going to read a poem titled “Bed in Summer”
by Robert Louis Stevenson. Tell them to listen carefully to the poet’s use of
rhyming words and the rhythm of the poem. Remind students that poets
sometimes use rhyme to help make the poem more interesting. Tell them
to also listen to find out how the poem relates to the tilt of the earth.


**Bed in Summer**
_by Robert Louis Stevenson_


_In winter I get up at night_
_And dress by yellow candle-light._
_In summer, quite the other way,_
_I have to go to bed by day._
_I have to go to bed and see_
_The birds still hopping on the tree,_
_Or hear the grown-up people’s feet_
_Still going past me in the street._
_And does it not seem hard to you,_
_When all the sky is clear and blue,_
_And I should like so much to play,_
_To have to go to bed by day?_


 - Discuss with students how the tilt of the earth changes the amount of
sunlight we get in each season by asking the following questions:


   - How does the poet use rhyming words in the poem?

   - What words does the poet repeat, or say more than once? Why?

   - How does this poem relate to the tilt of the earth?

   - Do we get more sunlight in the summer or in the winter?

   - Why does Robert Louis Stevenson say, “In winter I get up at night”?

   - Why does he say, “In summer, quite the other way, I have to go to bed by day”?

   - How does the poet feel about going to bed in summer?


 - Share with students that this poem was written in the 1800s, when people
did not have electricity like we do today. Explain that when it became dark at
night (earlier in seasons other than summer), people could not do as many
things with just the light of candles, and so they often went to bed earlier.

Note that the four seasons discussed in Lessons 2 and 3 might not have the
same characteristics as the seasons you and your students experience in
Texas. Be sure to read Lessons 2 and 3 ahead of time and plan your discussion
of seasons to include information relevant to students’ daily experiences.
If you live in a part of Texas with milder seasonal changes, think about how
you might teach about both milder seasons and the more distinct seasonal
changes depicted in the Read-Alouds in Lessons 2 and 3.


The purpose of the Syntactic Awareness Activity is to help students
understand the direct connection between grammatical structures and the
meaning of text. These syntactic activities should be used in conjunction
with the complex text presented in the Read-Alouds.

of the Northern Seasons chart.


**Show Image 2A-4: Northern summer**


_When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun during Earth’s_
_revolution around the sun, it receives more intense light from the sun_
_at a more direct angle. During this time, it is summer in the Northern_
_Hemisphere. Around June 21 each year, the sun reaches its highest_
_point overhead in the Northern Hemisphere. This is called the summer_
_solstice and is referred to as the longest day of the year. That means_
_that there is daylight for a longer period of time on that day than on any_
_other day of the year._


Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops



**42**


**Show Image 2A-5: Northern winter**


_As Earth revolves around the sun, the seasons begin to change_
_depending on which hemisphere is tilted most directly toward the_
_sun. This depends on where Earth is on its revolution, or orbit, around_
_the sun. One revolution takes one year, and each hemisphere is tilted_
_directly in the sun for part of the year. Six months after the longest_
_day in the Northern Hemisphere, the shortest day occurs. The winter_
_solstice in the Northern Hemisphere is on December 21._


**Show Image 2A-6: Northern spring and fall**


_When Earth is halfway between the two solstices, both hemispheres_
_receive the same amount of sunlight. This means that the hours of_
_daylight and of darkness are the same in each hemisphere. The days_
_that are equal are called equinoxes. The spring equinox occurs at the_
_beginning of spring on March 21. The autumn equinox occurs at the_
_beginning of autumn on September 21._

Do you know why many plants grow more

rapidly during the summer and more slowly,

Only certain parts of our planet have seasons. This is because of the shape

and tilt of Earth. The region around the equator receives the greatest

amount of direct, intense sunlight. This region of Earth is called a tropical

region because it is almost always hot and humid. ~~_[Locate the equator and_~~

~~_surrounding tropical regions on the globe for students.]_~~ The North and South

Poles receive the least amount of direct sunlight. They are the polar regions

of Earth. Generally, they remain cold and dry. In recent years, however, as

Earth’s overall climate has changed and has become warmer, the polar

regions are warming up too, and some of the ice caps in this region have

been melting. ~~_[Locate the North Pole, South Pole, and polar regions on the_~~

~~_globe for students.]_~~ The region between the poles, on either side of the

equator, is called the temperate region. In this region of the world, where

Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops


**Show Image 3A-2: Four seasons in Northern**
**Hemisphere**

Remember, during the time of year when the

Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun,

this part of our world receives more daylight

and more intense sunlight. This means it is

summertime in the Northern Hemisphere.

At the same time, the Southern Hemisphere



is tilted away from the sun, so it is winter there. ~~_[Have students locate the_~~

~~_Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere on the globe. Remind them_~~

~~_that we live in the Northern Hemisphere.]_~~ That’s why, as Earth revolves

around the sun, and is tilted on an axis, the seasons change. Now let’s

discover more information about each specific season.


As each year passes in the temperate region of the world, changes occur in

the weather. These weather cycles have been divided up into what we call the

seasons. Each season brings with it incredible changes in the world around us.


**Show Image 3A-3: Spring**

In spring, daylight hours increase and the

sunlight becomes much stronger. With

warmer weather, more rain begins to fall. With

increased light, warmth, and rain, plants begin

to grow again. Seeds resting in the soil begin





to take root. The warmth from the sun and the

rainfall enables plant seeds to germinate, or

begin to grow into plants.



You have probably heard the saying “April showers bring May flowers.” New

plants emerge, and plants that have been inactive for the winter become

active and start growing again. As buds and leaves form, the water the

plant has **absorbed** ~~_or taken in_~~ travels up the stem to the leaves. Plants use

air, water, and sunlight to make their own food, as well as oxygen, which is

required for most living organisms to survive, including us. This process is

called **photosynthesis** . It is during springtime that this great burst of life and

energy occurs. ~~_Why is there a “great burst of life” in spring?_~~


Springtime also sees the return of animals that had migrated, or moved to

warmer places during the wintertime. It is also the time when some animals

wake up from their winter hibernation. Spring is when many animals give

birth to their young. Animals give birth either by bearing live young or by

means small parts

The word _buds_ also

laying eggs. Animals that give birth to live young have nourished their young

inside their bodies. Animals that hatch from eggs have been nourished by a

yolk within the egg.


**Show Image 3A-4: Summer**

Because the Northern Hemisphere receives

more intense sunlight from the sun at a more

direct angle in the summer, temperatures are







usually at their highest during these months.

With the increase of light and heat in the

summer, plants grow big and strong. Young

animals are born and grow strong during this



fruitful time, as well. ~~_What kinds of baby animals do we often see in spring_~~

~~_and summer?_~~


**Show Image 3A-5: Autumn**

As the earth revolves, and summer turns

to autumn, both the temperature and the

environment begin to change again. In

autumn, often called “fall,” while it is still warm,

light from the sun is not as intense, and the





growth and development of plants and animals

begins to slow down. ~~_Remind students that_~~



Challenge


The word _deciduous_
comes from the Latin
word _decidere_, meaning
to fall down, or fall off.
Why are these trees
called deciduous trees?


**46**



~~_living things thrive with sunlight, so when there is less sunlight, some plants_~~

~~_and animals don’t grow as quickly, or cannot grow at all._~~


In many places in the Northern Hemisphere, autumn is a time to harvest

the crops that have grown and ripened beneath the summer sun. Grapes

are picked from the vines. Fruits such as apples, pears, and pumpkins are

ready to be eaten. As the amount of daylight lessens, and the temperature

continues to drop, the leaves of many trees change color. During this time in

many parts of the Northern Hemisphere, a world of copper, bronze, red, and

orange leaves is a sight to behold.


Leaves change color in autumn because deciduous [/d ə *sid*yoo*w ə s/]

trees receive less sunshine than they need to produce food, and

photosynthesis stops. When photosynthesis stops, these leaves begin to die

and fall off. Therefore, deciduous trees are trees that have leaves that change

color and fall off. Why do deciduous trees lose their leaves?


Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops


**Show Image 3A-6: Northern winter**

When winter arrives, it means that this part

of Earth is now tilted away from the sun and

temperatures and sunlight are at a **minimum** .

~~_Minimum is the smallest amount possible._~~ It

also means that summer has arrived in the

Southern Hemisphere. Because conditions are

less favorable for living things in winter, growth



and development slows down, and even stops.


During winter, deciduous trees rely on the food they previously produced and

converted into energy. This food supply is stored in their roots. During winter,

deciduous trees, as well as many other plants, enter a dormant state.


**Show Image 3A-7: Animals in winter**

In winter, some animals whose food source is

affected by the change in climate migrate, or

leave for warmer places. These animals sense

the change in daylight and temperature and

begin their annual migration. Migration is part

homes. They prepare for their migration by eating lots of food they can store

as energy to use on their journey. Mammals such as caribou and elk migrate

across vast expanses of land, and even fish migrate in winter in search of

warmth and food.


Like many plants that lay dormant in winter, there are animals that hibernate.

Hibernation is a kind of deep sleep. Like the deciduous trees, animals that

hibernate rely on the food they have stored in their bodies to get them

through the winter months. ~~_Can you name some animals that hibernate and_~~

~~_some animals that migrate?_~~


There are also animals that stay in their natural habitat through the colder

months and survive as best they can. Animals such as foxes, deer, and

rabbits search for food on the frozen land. Some build snug homes to keep

out the cold. They have behavioral adaptations that allow them to survive

in their ever-changing environment. People behave in ways that help them

survive, too. They prepare for the cold months ahead by wearing warmer

clothes and even changing the foods they eat. How do you prepare for

autumn and winter?

( _Answers may vary._ )


~~**WORD WORK: ADAPT (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “[Animals] have learned to adapt . . . to their
ever-changing environment.”


2. Say the word _adapt_ with me. (Write the word _adapt_ on the right side of the
board or chart paper.)


3. The word _adapt_ has multiple meanings. In the Read-Aloud, _adapt_ was used
to describe the process of populations changing their physical or behavior
traits over time to survive in their environment. What word might describe the
opposite of _adapt_ ? (Answers may vary.) (Write a word students suggested
or the word “same” on the left side of the board or chart paper to create a
horizontal word wall.)


4. What other words could describe the idea of change or staying the same?
(Allow the students to make several suggestions so there are 4–5 words.
Place the words horizontally in the proper relationship to the end words, _same_
and _adapt_ .)


**Use a Discussion activity for follow-up.** Talk to your partner about how you
have adapted to second grade. What are the differences between first grade
and second grade? How might you adapt next year in third grade? ~~**TEKS 2.7.A**~~

**Language:** Students will identify and generate compound words.


~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iv**~~


**Reading:** With assistance, students will use a graphic organizer to analyze the four
seasons. ~~**TEKS 2.6.G; TEKS 2.9.D.i**~~


Students will recognize characteristics and structures of informational text,


~~**SYNTACTIC AWARENESS ACTIVITY: COMPOUND WORDS (10 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** There may be variations in the sentences created by your class. Allow for these
variations, and restate students’ sentences so that they are grammatically correct.


  - Tell students two words can be added together to form a new word, called a
compound word.


  - Tell students if they know the meaning of the two words, they will most likely
be able to tell the meaning of the new compound word.


  - Ask students to identify the two words that make up each compound word
you read:

    - Bedtime = bed + time ( _time to go to bed_ )

    - Notebook = note + book ( _a book in which you write notes_ )

    - Bathroom = bath + room ( _a room where you take a bath_ )


  - Demonstrate for students how to predict the meaning of a compound word:

    - In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Springtime also sees the return of animals
that had migrated . . . to warmer places during the wintertime.”

    - Springtime is one compound word in this sentence. Which two words do
you hear? ( _spring and time_ )

    - What is spring? ( _the season with flowers_ )

    - What is time? ( _when you do something_ )

    - Use what you know about these two words to predict the meaning of
springtime: The time when it is spring!


  - Ask students to predict the meaning of a compound word:


**TEKS 2.2.B.iv** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding compound words, contractions, and common
abbreviations; **TEKS 2.6.G** Evaluate details read to determine key ideas; **TEKS 2.9.D.i** Recognize characteristics and structures of

Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops


    - Wintertime is one compound word in this sentence. Which two words do
you hear? ( _winter and time_ )


    - What is winter? ( _the coldest season_ )

    - What is time? ( _when you do something_ )

    - Talk to your partner about what wintertime might mean.


Exit Pass


       - Have students draw a picture of a compound word, as well as
pictures of the individual words that make up the compound
word. (Suggestions: daytime, nighttime, sunlight, firefly,
flashlight, moonlight, grasshopper, etc.)


      - Then have students write a sentence about the compound word
on the back of their paper. If there is time, have students share
their drawing with a partner, small group, or the class.


       - Collect students’ drawing and writing to check that they
understand how to deduce the meaning of a compound word.

~~**“THE LIFE CYCLE OF A PLANT” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 4A-1: New plant life**

All living things pass through stages from

birth to adult called a life cycle. For many

living things, the cycle of life follows the four

seasons of the year. ~~_Name the four seasons_~~

~~_in order based on the calendar._~~ For some





living things, the cycle of life is short and is

completed in just days, months, or a single



year. For other living things, the cycle of life continues for many, many years.

~~_Some living things have longer life spans than others. Some flies only live for a_~~

~~_few days, but humans, like you, can live to be over one hundred years old._~~


**Show Image 4A-2: Flowering plants**

Today you will learn about the life cycle of

a flowering plant. Just think about all the

flowering plants you see in the parks, yards,

gardens, fields, and meadows. Our world is

awash with colorful, vibrant flowering plants.

How do these plants grow and **reproduce**, or

make seeds for new plants? Let’s find out.


**TEKS 2.6.G** Evaluate details read to determine key ideas; **TEKS 2.7.D** Retell and paraphrase texts in ways that maintain
meaning and logical order; **TEKS 2.3.B** Use context within and beyond a sentence to determine the meaning of
unfamiliar words.


Lesson 4 The Life Cycle of a Plant
**57**


**Show Image 4A-3: Germination**

A flowering plant begins its life cycle as a seed.

Seeds need special conditions to germinate,

or begin to grow. Spring provides seeds with

the right conditions to grow. Therefore, the life

cycle of a flowering plant begins in spring.


**Show Image 4A-1: New plant life**

In spring, there is more sunlight and

temperatures are warmer. Seeds need air,

water, and warmth to germinate. Once the

seed germinates, or sprouts, it grows and

develops into a young plant with roots, a stem,

and leaves. ~~_Roots, stem, and leaves are the_~~

~~_three main parts of a young plant._~~ The first



leaves unfold to allow photosynthesis to begin. Photosynthesis is the process

by which plants make their own food, as well as oxygen. Plants use air, water,

and sunlight to make food in the form of glucose, a type of sugar.


In the warmth of spring and summer, plants continue to grow. The young

plant is called a seedling. Gradually, a plant’s stem will grow taller and true

leaves will **emerge** ~~_or come out_~~ .


**Show Image 4A-4: Interior of flower**

Once a flowering plant matures, or becomes

an adult plant, flowers appear. In order for a

flowering plant to reproduce by making seeds

that will make new flowering plants, it must be

pollinated. Pollination is when pollen from one





flower mixes with the pollen of another flower

so that the plant can make seeds.



**58**



But how is pollen transferred from one place to another? In other words,

how does pollination occur? Flowering plants need **pollinators** to help them

with pollination. Pollinators are insects, birds, and other animals that are

**attracted** to the shape, fragrance, or color of a flower. Without pollinators,

most flowering plants would not produce seeds and fruit. ~~_Remember, plants_~~

~~_need pollen from other plants in order to make seeds. Pollinators carry pollen_~~

~~_from flower to flower._~~


Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops


**Show Image 4A-5: Insect pollinators**

There are many types of pollinators, such as

birds and small mammals, but insects are the

number-one pollinators of flowering plants.

The flowers of a flowering plant are designed

to attract various pollinators, especially

insects. The shape, fragrance, and color of

the flower, as well as the sweet-tasting nectar



contained within the flower itself, attract many different kinds of insects.

As insects move from flower to flower, the dusty substance called pollen

clings to their bodies and is transferred from flower to flower. ~~_Honeybees,_~~

~~_bumblebees, ants, moths, beetles, and flies are just some of the insect_~~

~~_pollinators._~~


Honeybees are the most common pollinators. They carry out more

pollination than any other insect. Some scientists think that bees are

attracted to bright blue and violet-colored flowers, whereas butterflies like

fragrant yellow, pink, red, and orange flowers. Butterflies also like wide petals

so that they can settle on them while they drink the sweet nectar.


**Show Image 4A-6: Mammal and bird**
**pollinators**

Birds are important pollinators, too, especially

of wildflowers. For example, hummingbirds

have perfectly designed beaks that can reach

the nectar inside long, tubular-shaped flowers.



Support


Show students a tube
in your classroom to
help them understand
how hummingbirds use
their beaks to reach
inside “tubular-shaped
flowers.”


Support


Here, the word _bats_
means small, furry
animals with wings.
The word _bats_ also
means hits a baseball.
Use Poster 3M in the
Flip Book as additional
support for the multiple
meanings of _bats_ .






~~_[Point out the shape of each bird’s beak in the_~~

~~_image.]_~~ There are more than 2,000 different



kinds of birds in the world that feed on nectar. Birds have a poor sense of

smell and help to pollinate unscented flowering plants because they are

attracted by the color and shape of the flowers.


A variety of small mammals pollinate flowering plants. Mice, shrews, and

rats—even tree-dwelling animals such as lemurs and small monkeys—can

help to transfer pollen. People also help the pollination process. Often, when

people are working in their flower gardens, the dusty pollen is accidentally

carried from flower to flower.


For some plants, pollination does not just occur during the daytime. Some

scented flowers attract nighttime pollinators such as bats and moths.



Lesson 4 The Life Cycle of a Plant
**59**


Although ninety percent of flowering plants are pollinated by animals,

especially insects, the wind and even water can play a part, too. Pollen is

carried by the wind. Flowering plants that live in water, such as lilies, can be

pollinated as the water carries the pollen from one plant to another.


Once pollen has been transferred and reaches the new plant, the flower

produces seeds. The next part of the process is called seed dispersal. This

is the process of carrying the seeds away from the parent plant so that the

flowering plant life cycle can begin all over again. ~~_Most seeds are dispersed,_~~

~~_or spread, in late summer and fall._~~


**Show Image 4A-7: Seed dispersal**

Just like pollination, there are various ways

that seeds can be dispersed, or spread apart

in different directions. Many flowering plant

seeds are carried away from the parent plant

by the wind. As the wind blows, the seeds are





carried up into the air. Some flowering plants

have pods, or capsules, that explode, sending



Poster 2



forth a burst of tiny seeds into the air. Other flowering plants drop their

seeds into rivers and streams, and the seeds are carried along to their new

homes. ~~_[Pass around various seeds for students to examine.]_~~


Sometimes animals carry seeds from place to place without knowing it.

Some seeds contained within a **protective** casing, or covering, can attach

themselves to the fur of passing animals. ~~_This protective layer keeps the seed_~~

~~_safe._~~ The protective casing will eventually fall off the animal and rest in the

soil, ready to begin the life cycle process.


Some seeds are contained within a fruit that animals like to eat. Animals

either spit the seeds out, or they eat them and the seeds reach the earth in

the animal droppings that are left behind. Once on the ground, they rest in

the soil until the germination process can begin again the following spring.


**Show Image 4A-8: Seed to seed**

All of this is happening around us in spring,

summer, and early autumn. The potential for

new life is being created as flowering plants

are pollinated and seeds are dispersed. Across

the world, the life cycle of flowering plants is





renewed, or happens again, each year.

~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


Check for Understanding


**Show Poster 2 (life cycle of a flowering plant)**


**Think-Pair-Share:** Using Poster 2 and/or Image Cards 5–9 to
guide you, describe the stages in the life cycle of a flowering
plant. _(The first stage of the life cycle of a flowering plant is as a_
_seed. Once the seed has germinated, it sprouts. Then it grows and_
_develops into a young plant with roots, a stem, and leaves. Next the_
_plant flowers and then the flower withers and it creates seeds to be_
_dispersed and make new plants._ )


1. Inferential. Which one of the four seasons is the best time for planting
seeds? ( _spring_ ) Why? ( _In spring there is more sunlight and there are warmer_
_temperatures, as well as enough water. These conditions allow seeds to_
_germinate. Then, throughout the summer, the plant can thrive in the sunlight_
_and warmth._ )


2. Literal. What is pollination? _(when pollen from one flower mixes with the_
_pollen of another flower so that the plant can make seeds)_


3. Inferential. Why is pollination important to the life cycle of a plant? _(because_
_it allows plants to make new seeds and continue the life cycle)_


4. Inferential. How does pollination happen? ( _Pollen is carried by animals, the_
_wind, or water from one flower to another.)_

   - Inferential. How do flowering plants attract pollinators? ( _Flowering plants_
_use their fragrance, shape, and color to attract pollinators._ )


5. Literal. What is seed dispersal and why is it important to the life cycle of a
plant? _(Seed dispersal is when seeds from a plant are spread to other places_
_where they fall into the ground and germinate. It is important because it allows_
_the plant life cycle to continue and for new plants to grow.)_

   - What are the three ways seeds are dispersed? ( _by animals, the wind, and_
_water_ )


6. Evaluative. What might happen if there were no more honeybees to
pollinate flowers? _(Answers may vary but should cite the importance of_
_honeybees to pollination and therefore their importance in the continuation of_
_the plant life cycle.)_

Lesson 5 The Life Cycle of Trees
**65**


**66**



**Note to Teacher**


Like in the previous Read-Aloud “The Life Cycle of a Flowering Plant,” this
Read-Aloud explores not only the life cycle of a tree, but also how that
life cycle feeds into the larger ecosystem on earth. While it is important
for students to understand the stages of a tree in its life cycle, it is also
important to stress to students that trees are an integral part of the
existence of all organisms on earth.


**Universal Access**

 - Bring in a branch with rough bark and a branch with younger, smooth bark to
pass around to students.


 - You may wish to show students a time-lapse video of the growth of a tree
from seed.


 - Take students on a walk around school grounds, in your neighborhood, or
in a nearby park to identify the different trees. Help students determine the
tree’s stage in the seasonal cycle and/or its stage in the life cycle. If you have
a variety of trees to observe, have students determine whether they are
deciduous or evergreen trees.

should choose a tree
(preferably deciduous),
and draw pictures
and take notes on the
tree at least once a
month throughout
the school year to
observe its changes
over time. You might
also keep a class Tree

**Speaking and Listening:** Students will describe the life cycle of plants, including
trees.


~~**TEKS 2.7.D; TEKS 2.9.D.i**~~


~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED?**~~


**Life Cycle of a Flowering Plant**

  - Review with students that a cycle is a sequence of events that repeats itself
again and again. A life cycle includes the stages of a living thing’s life, from
seed to adult.


  - Ask students to sequence Image Cards 5–9 while describing each stage in

the life cycle of a flowering plant. _(seed, sprout/germination, seedling, adult_
_flower, seed dispersal)_


  - You may also wish to have students refer back to their sequenced plant life
cycles from the Application in Lesson 4.


  - Have students act out the life cycle of a flowering plant, using the sequenced
Image Cards as cues. Students should interpret each stage with a physical
action (e.g., curl up in a ball to represent a seed; put arms straight overhead
to represent germination).


**Trees and Seasons**

  - Refer students to the Northern Seasons chart you created in Lesson 3.
Remind students that they recorded information about how plants are
affected by the cycle of the seasons.


  - Ask students what they remember about how trees are affected by the cycle
of the seasons. _(spring: trees grow new leaves; summer: trees grow as they_
_absorb more sunlight; fall: leaves change color and begin to fall; winter: no_
_leaves, live off energy in roots)_


  - If possible, take students outside to observe any trees near your school and
discuss how the current season is affecting the trees.

~~**PURPOSE FOR LISTENING**~~


 - Have students listen carefully to learn more about a tree’s life cycle.


~~**“THE LIFE CYCLE OF TREES” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 5A-1: Trees**

There are certain things on Earth that make

life possible. We need water to live, just as we

need the air that we breathe. Have you ever

thought about where the air that you breathe

comes from? The air that you breathe is

**dependent** on, or supported by, the existence

of trees. Without trees, it would be almost

impossible for humans to survive on earth.


There are thousands of different kinds of trees in the world. There are

towering sequoia [s ə *koi* ə ] trees and tiny dwarf willows. There are noble oak

trees and scented pines. They all help to make life possible on this planet.



Key: 5A-2


CO2 is the scientific
abbreviation of Carbon
Dioxide. The tree’s
leaves take in carbon
dioxide, which is why
the arrow is pointing
towards the tree.


O2 is the scientific
abbreviation of Oxygen.
After trees take in
carbon dioxide, they
release oxygen for us to
breathe, which is why
the arrow is pointing
away from the tree.















**Show Image 5A-2: Tree taking in carbon**
**dioxide and emitting oxygen**

Trees provide us with many things and perform

tasks that you might not even be aware of.

For example, trees provide us with oxygen

to breathe. Trees also take in carbon dioxide

through their leaves. Carbon dioxide is a

greenhouse gas, meaning that if too much of it

builds up in Earth’s atmosphere, our planet will heat up. Therefore, trees help

to manage Earth’s climate and keep it livable for us. Tree roots help to fight

soil erosion and flooding by holding the soil together and absorbing water

from the soil. ~~_That means tree roots help hold the soil and ground in place._~~

Finally, we use trees, or the wood that comes from trees, all over the world

for all kinds of things. Can you think of three things that the wood from trees

is used for? ~~_[Pause for student responses.]_~~


**Show Image 5A-3: Tree parts**

Let’s review the different parts of a tree. ~~_[Point_~~

~~_to the various parts of a tree as you read about_~~

~~_them.]_~~ Do you remember what the main stem

of a tree is called? The main stem of a tree is

called the trunk. All the branches of the tree





grow out of the trunk. Tree leaves grow on

the branches. The roots hold the tree in the

ground. They not only hold the tree in the ground, they help to feed the tree,

too. Roots absorb water and nutrients from the ground. ~~Absorb~~ ~~_means to_~~

~~_take in, just like a sponge absorbs water._~~ The water and nutrients travel up

from the roots through the trunk and into the branches. Do you know why

leaves are such an important part of a tree? Leaves are important because

they enable the tree to produce food. ~~_Tree leaves produce food through_~~

~~_photosynthesis, just like the leaves of flowering plants._~~ Another important

part of the tree is the outside layer called the bark. The bark protects the tree

from outside forces such as heat, cold, insects, and viruses. ~~_Did you know_~~

~~_that plants can get diseases from viruses too?_~~


**Show Image 5A-4: Tree seeds**

Trees follow the same life cycle as other

plants. Just like that of a flower, a tree’s life

cycle begins with a seed. Tree seeds can be

as large as tennis balls, or as tiny as freckles.

They come in various shapes and sizes, too.





They can be flat, smooth, bumpy, long, or thin.

Tree seeds have three main parts. They are the



**70**



embryo, or egg; the stored food inside the egg, which enables the seed to

grow and change; and the seed coat, which eventually falls off.


Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops


Most seeds are carried away from the parent tree that produced them. Do

you remember how seeds are dispersed, or spread apart? They are dispersed

in various ways. They are carried by animals, people, wind, and water.

Wherever they land, they rest in the soil until **germination** begins.


Germination is when a seed begins to grow, or sprout. Certain conditions are

required for germination to happen. We have learned that in the temperate

parts of the world, the seasons affect the life cycle of living things, especially

plants. Therefore, when there is enough warmth and direct sunlight, as well

as water from rain, the seed splits open and germination begins. This usually

occurs in spring when there is sufficient warmth and rain.


**Show Image 5A-5: Close-up of germinated**
**tree seed**

Once germination begins, the seed produces

roots that search for groundwater. ~~_The word_~~

~~groundwater~~ ~~_is a compound word made of the_~~

~~_word_~~ ~~ground~~ ~~_and the word_~~ ~~water.~~ ~~_What do you_~~





~~_think it means?_~~ ~~(water that is in the ground)~~

As they find water, the roots hold fast in the



ground and a stem grows up towards the sunlight. Tiny seed leaves open

and use the sun and water to make food. The seed has become a seedling,

or young plant. Seedlings need just the right amount of water, warmth, and

sunshine to grow. With the right conditions, seedlings develop into young trees

with roots, a trunk, branches, and leaves. Young trees are called saplings.


**Show Image 5A-6: Tree sapling**

Tree saplings are much smaller than **mature**

trees, or adult trees. Usually, trees are called

saplings when they are between three and

fifteen years of age. A tree sapling’s bark is

smooth, and its trunk is **flexible** —meaning it

can bend more easily than a mature tree can.

~~_When something is flexible, it means it can_~~



~~_bend or move quite easily._~~ Once a tree is considered mature, it may flower

and produce fruits, nuts, or cones. Some trees simply produce seeds.


Lesson 5 The Life Cycle of Trees
**71**


**Show Image 5A-7: Deciduous and evergreen**
**trees**

There are two types of trees: deciduous and

evergreen. Deciduous trees shed their leaves.

Deciduous trees tend to have wide, flat leaves,

whereas evergreen tree leaves tend to be

narrow and thin like needles. During the cold

winter months, deciduous trees shed their

_(maple, oak, birch, etc.)_

_(spruce, pine, fir, etc.)_



leaves and become inactive for the winter, much like hibernating animals

do during the wintertime. In fact, this is what keeps them alive during the

coldest part of the year.


To prepare for this time of rest, deciduous trees stop using their leaves to

make food, and instead they shed these leaves. Then, during the cold winter

months, they save their energy until spring returns. In the spring, they will

use their energy to produce new leaves.


Evergreen trees, on the other hand, shed and reproduce their leaves

throughout the year, so there are green leaves on evergreen trees all year

long. The cones of evergreen trees are its flowers. Unlike deciduous trees,

evergreen trees do not shed all of their leaves at the end of fall. Instead, they

use their leaves to make food all winter.


How long does it take for a tree to grow to its full size? Well, this depends

on a number of things. Different kinds of trees grow at different speeds. In

tropical parts of the world, where there is constant intense sunshine and

rainfall, a tree can reach maturity, or become an adult, in thirty years. In

colder regions of the world, it can take a hundred years or more.


**Show Image 5A-8: Tree destruction**

The length of a tree’s life depends on many

things. It will always depend on the tree

having enough sunshine and water, but other

factors can affect its growth and lifespan,

too. The condition of the soil in which the





tree is growing, and diseases such as insect

infestations and bacteria, can alter the natural

**72**



lifespan of a tree. ~~_An infestation occurs when a large number of something_~~

~~_harmful enters an area._~~ Accidents such as fires and natural disasters such as

hurricanes and floods can have an effect too. Also, people cut trees down so

that they can be used to make a variety of products.


Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops


When a tree lives for a long time and then dies, it is not totally at the end of

its journey. **Decomposers**, like earthworms, bacteria, and fungi, take over the

dead tree. ~~_Fungi are living things such as molds, mushrooms, and yeasts that_~~

~~_live on dead or decaying things._~~ Through the decomposition process, they

help to slowly break down the tree into a rich nutrient that feeds the soil and

enables new tree seeds to grow.


**Show Image 5A-9: Life cycle of an apple tree**

And there you have it, the life cycle of a tree.





~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. Literal. Why are trees important to life on earth? _(they absorb carbon dioxide_
_and emit oxygen; they help keep the climate livable; their roots prevent soil_
_erosion)_

4. We knew the germination of the seeds had occurred when we saw our garden
covered with tiny green leaves.


5. Have you ever watched the germination of a seed? What happened to the
seed? Did it change or grow new parts? Try to use the word _germination_
when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/
or rephrase the students’ responses: “You can tell when germination is
happening because . . . ”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I will read two choices about
what happens to seeds during the germination process. You will choose the
correct answer. Be sure to use the word _germination_ in your answer.


   - Does germination happen to the seed or to the adult plant in the life cycle

of a flowering plant? ( _Seed germination happens to the seed of a flowering_
_plant._ )


   - Does seed germination happen in the spring or in the winter? ( _The_
_germination process usually takes place in the spring, when the ground has_
_thawed and the air is warm.)_


   - Are water and sunlight, or rocks and grass, necessary to the germination
process? ( _Water and sunlight are necessary for germination to occur._ )

plant life cycle, and the life cycle of a tree. Have students explain and
sequence each stage of the cycles. Remind students that trees have a sapling
stage in their life cycle, unlike the life cycle of a plant.


Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops



**80**


**Class Book: Plant Life Cycle Encyclopedia**


Materials: Drawing paper, drawing tools

  - Tell students they are going to make a class book to help them remember what
they have learned in this unit about the life cycle of a flowering plant and a tree.
Have students brainstorm important information about how seasonal cycles
affect these plants. Have each student choose one idea to draw a picture of, and
ask them to write a caption for the picture. Bind the pages to make a class book
to put in the class library for students to read again and again.

**Riddles for Core Content**

  - Ask students riddles such as the following to review core content:

    - I am a sequence of events that repeats over and over again in the same
order. What am I called? _(a cycle)_

    - I am an imaginary central line running through the North and South Poles
around which planet Earth rotates. What am I? _(an axis)_

    - I am a word that describes the movement of the earth around the sun over
the course of one year. Which word am I? _(orbit or revolve)_

    - I am a word that describes how the earth’s axis is on a slant or at an angle and
am the reason we have a change in seasons. Which word am I? _(tilt or tilted)_

    - I am a word that describes what a seed does when it starts to grow. Which
word am I? _(germinates)_

    - I am a young plant with a stem, roots, and leaves; I am grown from a seed.
What am I? _(a seedling)_

    - I am a young tree that is taller than most of your parents. What am I? _(a_
_sapling)_

    - We have the important job of helping to carry pollen from one flower to

another, so an adult plant can reproduce, or make more of its own kind. What
are we? _(pollinators—insects, birds, small mammals, water, the wind, etc.)_

**Compare/Contrast**


Materials: Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard

  - Tell students that there are many things to compare and contrast in the
Read-Alouds they have heard so far. Remind students that compare means
to tell how things are similar, and contrast means to tell how things are
different. Have students choose a topic from the following list to compare/
contrast on a chart. You may do this individually or as a class.


    - Earth’s rotation and Earth’s orbit

    - the four seasons


  - You may wish to extend this activity by using the chart as a prewriting tool
and ask students to write two paragraphs, one describing similarities and the
other describing differences.

**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**


Materials: Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard

 - Give students a key unit concept or vocabulary word such as _cycle_ . Have
them brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear the word,
such as _repeats_, _four seasons_, etc. Record their responses on chart paper, a
chalkboard, or whiteboard for reference.


**Writing Prompts**

 - Students may be given an additional writing prompt such as the following:


   - Flowers are important to the life cycle of some plants because . . .

   - The four seasons of the year are considered parts of a cycle because . . .

   - My favorite season is because . . .


**Using a Map**


Materials: World map or globe

 - On a world map or globe, review the location of the equator and the North
and South Poles. Have students talk about the amount of sunlight in these
locations and how Earth’s tilt is the cause of this.


**Seed Observation**


Materials: Dried lima beans; small containers; small plastic knife
(optional); drawing paper, drawing tools

 - Have students place several dried lima bean seeds in small, water-filled
containers to soak overnight. The next day, split the seed halves of the bean
apart using your fingers or a small plastic knife. Give each student or group of
students the seed halves, and have them observe the plant embryos inside.
Ask students why the plant embryos are important to the life cycle of a plant.
Have students draw a picture of the plant embryo and write a caption about
how baby plants germinate from a bean seed embryo.


**Seed Samples**


Materials: Variety of fresh and/or dried foods and spices (e.g., sunflower
seeds, pomegranates, pumpkin seeds)


**Note:** Be sure to follow your school’s policy regarding food distribution and
allergies.


 - Display a variety of foods on a table for students to investigate some seeds
and plants that humans use for food. Have students examine each item and
give examples of how they think humans may use each of these foods. For
example, sunflower seeds can be used to grow new sunflower plants, but
they are also a food that people can eat.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Application**

  - Acquire a fresh raw egg and be prepared to crack it into a jar or bowl during
the Application activity. Be sure to check with your school’s policy regarding
food distribution and allergies.


**Note to Teacher**


This Read-Aloud explores the life cycle of a chicken. The title of the ReadAloud poses an age-old question that touches on an innate characteristic
of nature’s cycles, that they have no beginning or end. Students are not
expected to be able to eloquently explain why there is no answer to the
question “Which came first, the chicken or the egg?”, but they should begin
to show that they understand that the life cycle repeats itself in all living
things on earth.


**Universal Access**

  - You may wish to discuss with students what foods they get from chickens.
Note that this may be a sensitive subject for students, but may also allow
some students to better access the content. Use your judgment and
knowledge of your students in facilitating this discussion.


  - Show students a video of a chick hatching from an egg and a video or images
depicting fully grown roosters and hens.

“


**Show Image 6A-1: Chicken**

A chicken is a type of bird. Did you know that

there are more chickens in our world than

any other type of bird? In fact, there are more

chickens on Earth than people.





Like almost all birds, chickens have feathers

and wings, and they lay eggs. Chickens can

fly, but not very far. Have you ever heard the



Challenge


Which do you think

came first, the
chicken or the egg?

Why?



question, “Which came first, the chicken or the egg?” Listen carefully to this

lesson on the life cycle of a chicken, and you’ll see why that question is so

difficult to answer.


All living things go through a sequence of stages from birth to adult called a

life cycle. The life cycles of plants and trees begin with seeds; the life cycles

of chickens begin with eggs!


**Show Image 6A-2: Egg**

Have you ever cracked an egg open? The

outer layer that you crack is called the

eggshell. Eggshells can be many different

colors, including white, light brown, speckled,

pale blue, or even green. Inside the shell, the





egg consists of a yellow **yolk**, which is made

mostly of fat, and a clear part, called the **albumen** [/al*byoo*m ə n/].


Do you know what a female chicken is called? A female chicken is called a

hen. Do you know what a male chicken is called? A male chicken is called a

rooster. Hens lay eggs. Not all eggs become baby chickens, or chicks. Some

are sent to stores so that people can buy them and eat them.


**Show Image 6A-3: Hen sitting on eggs**

As soon as a hen lays her eggs, she will begin

to care for them. The hen will sit on the eggs

and even turn the eggs to make sure that the

eggs stay warm. The eggs need to stay warm

for twenty-one days in order to develop into





chicks. ~~_Twenty-one days is three weeks._~~ Let’s

find out what happens inside the egg during

this time!


**Show Image 6A-4: Diagram of developing**

**chicken embryo**

Inside the egg, great changes are happening.

A tiny **embryo** is developing inside the egg. ~~_An_~~

~~_embryo is an animal in the early stages of life_~~

~~_before it is born or has hatched._~~ The embryo

needs food, water, and oxygen to grow and

develop. Within forty-eight hours, tiny, red





blood vessels spread out from the embryo to the yolk and to the inside of

the shell. Directly under the shell are two membranes, or air sacs, containing

oxygen. As the embryo develops and grows into a chick, it uses this oxygen.

This supply of oxygen is **replenished**, or replaced, as oxygen passes through

the shell of the egg. How does oxygen pass through the shell of an egg? If

you look at an eggshell under a magnifying glass, you will see that it has tiny

holes called pores that allow oxygen in, and carbon dioxide out. ~~_Humans also_~~

~~_have pores. Pores are the openings on our skin out of which hair grows._~~


Lesson 6 Which Came First, the Chicken or the Egg?
**89**


The parts of the egg inside the shell contain all the food the growing embryo

needs to develop into a fully formed chick. The yellow yolk provides the food

necessary for the embryo to grow big and strong. The clear part of the egg,

or albumen, surrounds the yolk and provides the growing embryo with more

food and water.


The first part to develop is the chick’s nervous system. Then the brain starts

to form, and then the heart starts to beat. After five days, the wings and the

legs begin to develop. After seven days, the embryo is fully formed but is

quite tiny. Around the tenth day, feathers begin to develop and the growth

of the fully formed embryo into a chick accelerates, or speeds up. ~~_Look at_~~

~~_the image. What is the difference between Day 8 and Day 20 in terms of the_~~

~~_chick’s development?_~~


As the chick grows, it uses up its food supply. After twenty days inside the

egg, the chick pierces, or makes a hole in the air sac and begins to breathe

air with its own lungs for the first time. This means that the chick is ready to

hatch out of the egg. The chick begins to chirp to let its mother know that it

will soon be in the outside world. On the twenty-first day, the chick uses its

egg tooth to chip a circle around the inside of the shell. It pushes against the

Support
sides of the egg with its body to break open the shell.



Have students act out
the hatching of chicks
according to the steps
in the text.





**Show Image 6A-5: Newly hatched chicks**

When the chick first emerges, it is tired from

the effort of breaking out of its shell. It is also

wet. Before long, however, the feathers dry out

and become lovely and fluffy. ~~_Have you ever_~~

~~_seen newborn chicks? Where did you_~~

~~_see them?_~~


The mother hen, having cared for her eggs,



**90**



continues to care for her chicks. She will shelter them under her wings to

keep them warm and dry. Chicks know instinctively how to scratch around

in the dirt for food. ~~_That means chicks know how to scratch around for food_~~

~~_without being taught to do so._~~ For the first two weeks, the chicks stay close to

their mother.


Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops


**Show Image 6A-6: Chicken life cycle diagram**

Chicks grow quickly in the first months of

their lives. When a female is about six months

old, she will start to lay eggs. These first eggs

will be quite small, though. Interestingly,

females are called pullets, not hens, until they

are one year old.



And so the life cycle begins all over again. A hen lays the eggs. The hen will

care for the eggs and keep them warm. After twenty-one days, the eggs will

hatch and new chicks will emerge.


Now that you know more about the life cycle of a chicken, which do you

think came first—the chicken or the egg? ~~_[Pause for students to give their_~~

~~_opinions.]_~~


**Note:** While the egg is the logical “starting point” of the life cycle of a
chicken, it is important students understand that this cycle happens over
and over again, with chickens laying new eggs that hatch into chicks, become
chickens, and lay more eggs.

replaced, as oxygen passes through the shell of the egg.”


2. Say the word _replenished_ with me.


3. The word _replenished_ means to replace, restore, or refill.


4. The refrigerator was almost empty, and the groceries needed to be
replenished.


5. Can you think of items that need to be replenished? Try to use the
word _replenished_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If
necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses: “ . . . needs to be
replenished.”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I am going to read a list
of several things to you. If what I read describes something that can
be replenished, say, “That can be replenished.” If what I read describes
something that cannot be replenished, say, “That cannot be replenished.”
Remember to answer in complete sentences.


    - an almost empty glass of water ( _That can be replenished._ )

    - an almost empty gas tank ( _That can be replenished._ )

    - snacks for school ( _That can be replenished._ )

~~_What sound do frogs make?_~~ ~~(Frogs make~~

~~croaking sounds, like “ribbit”.)~~ Did you know

that there are thousands of different kinds of

frogs in the world? Frogs don’t all look alike

either. Frogs can be all different sizes and

colors. The smallest frog in the world was

recently discovered in Papua New Guinea. It is

smaller than a dime! ~~_[Show students a dime for reference.]_~~ The largest frog in

the world is the Goliath frog from Africa. It can grow up to three feet long and

weigh seven pounds.


Frogs live on every continent in the world except Antarctica. Why do you think

they don’t live in Antarctica? Frogs don’t live in Antarctica because it is too cold,

although there is a frog that lives just inside the Arctic Circle. Do you know what

a group of frogs is called? A group of frogs is called an army. OK, now that you

know some cool facts about frogs, let’s find out about their life cycles.


**TEKS 2.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and answer questions using multi-word responses;

Note


There are many frogs
and toads that are
native to Texas. One
toad that can be found
in the eastern Texas
woodlands is the East
Texas Toad. These toads
are brown and 2-3”
long. One frog that can
be found in western
Texas is the Canyon Tree
Frog. These frogs are
approximately 1.5” long
and are a light brown
color. These frogs are
nocturnal, which means
they are mostly active
at night.



Lesson 7 The Life Cycle of a Frog
101


Just like a chicken, a frog’s life cycle includes birth, growth, reproduction,

and death. The reproduction stage creates new life so that the cycle repeats

over and over again. ~~_How are the chicken and frog’s life cycles similar?_~~


**Show Image 7A-2: Frogspawn**

Have you ever stood at the edge of a pond or

stream in the spring and spotted a jelly-like

substance floating in the water? If so, you

have seen the first stage of a frog’s life cycle.

The first stage of a frog’s life cycle is the egg.





That jelly-like substance is frogspawn, which is

hundreds of soft, jelly-like eggs. In the center



of each egg is a tiny black dot. Each black dot is a tiny embryo that will

become a tadpole soon. A developing young frog is called an embryo at the

early stages and a tadpole at the later stages. ~~_When else have we heard about_~~

~~_embryos?_~~ ~~(The inside of a tree seed is called an embryo. A growing baby~~

~~chick is called an embryo as it grows inside the egg.)~~


The mother frog lays her eggs in water in spring, when the cold winter

months are over and the water is warm enough for her eggs to survive.

~~_What other living things reproduce in the spring when it is warm?_~~ ~~(trees,~~

~~plants)~~ The mother frog lays hundreds of eggs at one time. Female frogs

lay hundreds of eggs at one time because not all of the eggs survive. Unlike

hens, frogs do not usually stay with their eggs, so fish, birds, and water

insects are more likely to eat some of the eggs. Some of the eggs will survive

and eventually develop into tadpoles.


**Show Image 7A-3: Tadpoles**

Just as a developing chick is nourished by the

yolk of an egg as it grows, a developing frog is

also nourished by yolk-like material in the egg.

Within a few days or weeks of its development,

depending on the type of frog, the embryo





develops into a tadpole with a head and tail.

Soon after that, when its **gills** are formed, it is



**102**



ready to hatch out of the egg. Gills allow the tadpole to breathe underwater.

Fish have gills, too. ~~_People cannot breathe underwater because people do not_~~

~~_have gills. Instead, we hold our breath when we go underwater._~~


Once it hatches, a tadpole lives in water. A tadpole has a long, flat tail that it

uses to swim. Its gills allow it to get oxygen from the water. Tadpoles swim


Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops


about in search of food. Although they still feed from the leftovers of the

eggs, they also search for small, green water plants. Tadpoles grow very

quickly, especially in warm water.


**Show Image 7A-4: Tadpole metamorphosis**

After some time, the tadpole begins its

transformation into a frog. When a living

thing undergoes a huge change in shape, this

process is called **metamorphosis** . Tadpoles

change quite dramatically from fish-like





creatures with gills, into four-legged land

creatures with **lungs** . ~~_Frogs can breathe air_~~



~~_because they have lungs, just like people. Lungs are the body parts that we_~~

~~_use to breathe air._~~ Let’s find out more about this remarkable transformation.


After the appearance of the head and the tail, the tadpole grows back legs.

Gradually, lungs develop inside its body, and its gills begin to disappear

inside its body. Because it has lungs, the tadpole can now breathe air. Next,

front legs begin to grow. As a tadpole’s legs grow, its tail gets smaller. The

tadpole uses its tail and its legs to swim through the water. It also begins to

use its legs to climb onto plants in the water.


Gradually, the tadpole’s legs grow longer, and its tail disappears completely.

At this stage, the tadpole is a young frog that can leave its watery home and

use its lungs to breathe. For many types of frogs, all of this has happened in

about twelve weeks. At this stage of its development, the young frog is about

an inch long. ~~_That’s roughly the size of your thumb._~~ Very young frogs are

often called froglets.


Young frogs leave the pond to find other tasty treats to eat on land. They do

not go too far away from their watery home, though. On land they search for

small insects, worms, and slugs. They catch their food with their long, sticky

tongues. They have to be very careful though, as lots of animals, such as

snakes, lizards, and birds, eat young frogs.


**Show Image 7A-5: Frog skin**

Do you know what you call an animal that

can live in water and on land? An animal that

can live in water and on land is called an

**amphibian** . Frogs are amphibians.



Challenge


What other animals
do you know
that go through
metamorphosis, turning
from one thing into
another? (Answers may
vary but may include
caterpillars, butterflies,
moths, etc.)





Although frogs spend a lot of time on land,

they stay fairly close to water. Frogs need



Lesson 7 The Life Cycle of a Frog
103


to keep their skin damp, ~~_or somewhat wet._~~ Instead of drinking water, they

absorb it through their skin. Frogs breathe through their skin when they are

in water, but they breathe through their lungs when they are on land. They

also seek out water when they want to cool down. If water is not nearby, they

sit in the shade. They sit in the sun when they want to warm up. In the winter,

many frogs hibernate. Often they **burrow**, or dig a hole in mud at the bottom

of ponds. If they can’t find a pond, they seek out a damp place, such as a pile

of logs, in which to spend the winter.


**Show Image 7A-6: Frog camouflage**

The young frog has to survive until it is two or

three years old to become a parent. To live that

long, frogs have various survival techniques.

~~_A survival technique is a way of staying alive._~~

Their skin is often the color of their natural





habitat. This helps them to blend into the

background and avoid hungry predators. This



is a form of camouflage. Frogs can hop quickly out of reach. They are also

excellent swimmers. They can jump into the nearest pond or river to avoid

danger. Some frogs have poisonous skin to protect them from predators. All

frogs have large, bulging eyes. This helps them to more easily find their own

food and avoid becoming dinner for some other creature.


When a frog is between two and three years old, it will return to the pond

where it was born. At this stage, the frog is now considered an adult.


**Show Image 7A-7: Frog life cycle**

And so the life cycle begins all over again. Each

spring, a jelly-like substance appears in ponds

and rivers. It is frogspawn, or hundreds of small

eggs containing tiny embryos. ~~Frogspawn~~ ~~_is a_~~

~~_compound word. If_~~ ~~spawn~~ ~~_means eggs, what does_~~





~~frogspawn~~ ~~_mean?_~~ In time, many will hatch into

tadpoles. And a little while later, these tadpoles



**104**



will turn into froglets and then into frogs that will live for seven years or more. It

is amazing that frogs change their appearance so dramatically throughout their

life cycle, from egg to tadpole to froglet to adult. Next, we will learn about the

incredible transformation in another creature’s life cycle. Stay tuned!

**Turn and Talk:** Describe the four stages of the life cycle of a frog.
(egg, tadpole, froglet, and adult frog)


1. Literal. How do tadpoles breathe underwater? (Tadpoles, like fish, have gills
so that they can breathe underwater.)


2. Inferential. Are tadpoles affected by the cycle of the seasons? (yes) How do
tadpoles prepare for the cold of winter? (In winter tadpoles burrow under the
mud at the bottom of the pond and hibernate. In spring, female frogs lay their
eggs.)


3. Literal. What is it called when a living thing undergoes a huge change
in shape and appearance, like the frog does from tadpole to adult frog?
(metamorphosis)


4. Evaluative. Question-Pair-Share: Asking questions after a Read-Aloud is
one way to see how much everyone has learned. Think of a question you can
ask your neighbor about the Read-Aloud that starts with the word who, what,
where, when, or why. For example, you could ask, “What is the name for a
frog after it emerges from an egg and lives in water?” Turn to your neighbor
and ask your what question. Listen to your neighbor’s response. Then your
neighbor will ask a new what question, and you will get a chance to respond.
I will call on several of you to share your questions with the class.

2. Say the word burrow with me.


3. Burrow means to make a hole into or under something.


4. Some animals use their front legs to push dirt aside, so they can burrow
deeper into the ground.


5. Has there ever been a time when you tried to burrow into something or
when you saw an animal burrow into something? Try to use the word burrow
when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or
rephrase the students’ responses: “Once, I saw my dog burrow into . . . ”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the word
burrow? How do you know that it is an action word?


**Use a Discussion activity for follow-up.** Share with your partner why
you think it is important for creatures to burrow when they hibernate.

life cycle of a flowering plant, the life cycle of

a tree, the life cycle of a chicken, and the life

cycle of a frog.





**114**



Today you will learn about the life cycle

of a butterfly. A butterfly’s life cycle is

somewhat different from most animals because it goes through a stage

called metamorphosis. Metamorphosis is a process in which a living thing

changes or transforms from one shape into another. ~~_What animal did we_~~

~~_already learn about that goes through metamorphosis?_~~ ~~(frog)~~ This means

that it literally changes its entire appearance. ~~_How does the frog change its_~~

~~_entire appearance?_~~ ~~(It starts as a tadpole, and then grows legs and arms~~

~~and loses its tail and becomes a fully grown frog.)~~ Let’s hear more about the

extraordinary life cycle of those beautiful creatures called butterflies. ~~_At what_~~

~~_time of the year do we see butterflies?_~~ ~~(We usually see butterflies during~~

~~spring and summer. If it is warm enough we might see them in early fall too.)~~

The largest butterfly in the world is the Queen

Alexandra Birdwing. Its wingspan is twelve



inches wide! It lives in the rainforests of Papua New Guinea. The smallest

butterfly is the Western Pygmy Blue from Africa.


Incredibly, butterflies can only fly when their bodies are warm enough.

The butterfly’s body temperature must be 85°F for them to take to the air.

~~_85˚F is the temperature on a warm, summer day._~~ When they do, the fastest

butterflies can fly is 12 miles per hour. They cannot move at all if their body

temperature drops below 55°F. ~~_55˚F is the temperature on a chilly day._~~ Well,

now that you know some interesting facts about butterflies, it’s time to find

out about a butterfly’s life cycle.


**Show Image 8A-3: Butterfly eggs**

A butterfly begins its life as an egg that has

been produced by its mother. Butterfly eggs

can be round or oval. There are even some

that are cylindrical in shape. ~~_[Show students_~~

~~_something that is cylinder-shaped in your_~~



Note


The monarch butterfly
( _Danaus plexippus_ )
is the Texas state
butterfly. Texas is home
to about 450 species of
butterfly. Texas is one
of the states with the
most butterfly diversity.
The butterflies are
so popular here that
festivals are organized
each fall throughout
South Texas.

Here, the word _round_
refers to the shape of
the eggs. The word
_round_ also can mean
to go or pass around
something. Use Poster
4M in the Flip Book as
additional support for
the multiple meanings
of _round_ .





~~_classroom for reference.]_~~ The shape of the egg

often depends on the kind of butterfly that laid

the egg.



Female butterflies lay their eggs on the leaves of plants. They do this so

that when their young hatch, there is food right there for them to eat. They

choose these leaves carefully, selecting only the leaves that their young will

eat. Depending on the kind of butterfly, it can take from six days to twenty

days for the eggs to hatch.



Lesson 8 The Life Cycle of a Butterfly
**115**


**Show Image 8A-4: Butterfly larva**

Can you guess what hatches out of a butterfly

egg? Well, it isn’t a butterfly. It is actually a

tiny caterpillar, also called a **larva** . A caterpillar

is a small creature that moves by squeezing

its muscles. It squeezes its muscles starting at

the back end of its body and moving up to its

head. This movement pushes the caterpillar

forward. ~~_Let’s try to move like caterpillars._~~



Challenge


Why do you think
it is important for
caterpillars to eat as
much as they can after
they first hatch?


Support


What happens when you
outgrow your clothes?


**116**



A caterpillar also uses its muscles to eat. The caterpillar’s job is to eat as

much as it can. A caterpillar eats the egg that sheltered it. Then it begins

to eat the leaf on which it was born. The tiny caterpillar keeps on eating,

devouring all the leaves around it. Caterpillars don’t sleep, so they eat

during the day and at nighttime, too. They grow very quickly.


Because caterpillars grow so quickly, they outgrow their skin. This means

that because their skin does not grow with them the way yours does, they

**molt**, or shed, their outer skin to reveal new skin underneath. They do this

repeatedly until they are fully grown. Some caterpillars even eat their own

old skin!


A caterpillar is usually fully grown somewhere between nine and twenty days.

At this stage, the caterpillar will leave its food supply and go in search of a

safe, leafy place to enter into the next stage of its life cycle. Once in this safe

place, it attaches itself to a twig or small branch by making a silk pad on

the bottom of the branch or twig. The caterpillar then hooks itself onto the

silk pad.


**Show Image 8A-5: Chrysalis**

~~_[Point to the image on the left.]_~~ In the next

stage, the caterpillar forms a protective outer

casing called a pupa, or chrysalis [kris* ə *lis].

The formation of the chrysalis is the final stage

of molting, or shedding outer skin. When it





molts for the final time, the new skin becomes

the outer shell of the chrysalis.




~~_[Point to the image on the right.]_~~ Inside the chrysalis something incredible

happens. The caterpillar transforms from one thing into another in the

process called metamorphosis.


Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops


**Show Image 8A-6: Newly hatched butterfly**

Think about what a caterpillar looks like when

it is fully grown, just before metamorphosis.

It is small and round. When it emerges from

the chrysalis, it is no longer a caterpillar but

a delicate, beautifully colored butterfly with

wings. The caterpillar’s body has completely

changed. (For some butterflies it is sometimes



possible to tell when the butterfly is fully transformed and ready to emerge

because its chrysalis becomes **transparent**, or see-through.) The butterfly

does not look anything like the small, round-bodied creature it used to be.

~~_Is it still the same animal after metamorphosis?_~~ Instead of mouthparts that

chew, the butterfly has a straw-like tube that can drink nectar from sweet
tasting flowers. It has antennae. This metamorphosis takes between ten to

fourteen days to complete.


At first, the butterfly’s wings are very delicate. They are quite soft and are folded

up, not yet ready to carry the butterfly up into the air. It will take several hours

before the butterfly is ready to take to the sky. During this time, a fluid is being

pumped all around the butterfly’s body, especially into the wings.


**Show Image 8A-7: Butterfly body parts**

Butterflies use their eyes to detect motion and

color. This helps them avoid predators and to

find food. They can even see ultraviolet light,

which is invisible to humans.



Support


Show students a timelapse video showing a
butterfly going through
metamorphosis.





The life cycle begins all over again as female

butterflies search for the right places to lay their

eggs. Amazingly, female butterflies use their

feet to find the best place to lay their eggs. The



butterfly “tastes” various leaves using her feet to find just the right home for her

young. She knows that when her eggs hatch, they will need an instant food supply.


Lesson 8 The Life Cycle of a Butterfly
**117**


**Show Image 8A-8: Migration**

Did you know that butterflies do not live for a

very long time? Many butterflies live for just

about one month. There are even some that

live for just a matter of days. However, there

are a few, such as the Monarch butterfly,

that can live for almost a year and in the fall

migrate thousands of miles. ~~_What does the_~~

~~_word_~~ ~~migrate~~ ~~_mean?_~~


**Show Image 8A-9: Butterfly life cycle**

During their lifetime, butterflies help to

pollinate our flowering plants. Because they

are cold-blooded and like only warm weather,

we only see them in the late spring and

summer. But when we do, they are a beautiful

sight to see in our gardens and parks. Perhaps

now that you know all about the life cycle of

a butterfly, when you next see one, you will

appreciate it even more.

**Turn and Talk:** Describe the life cycle of a butterfly. ( _egg,_
_caterpillar, chrysalis or pupa, butterfly, lay eggs)_


1. Literal. Caterpillars grow so quickly that they outgrow their skin. What does
a caterpillar do with the skin it outgrows? ( _A caterpillar will molt or shed the_
_skin it outgrows. It also might eat the skin. The last time it molts, the skin_
_becomes the outside of the chrysalis._ )


2. Inferential. After metamorphosis, does the adult animal look like it did when
it was younger? Is it still the same animal? ( _It doesn’t look like it did when it_
_was younger, but it is still the same animal._ )


3. Evaluative. _Think-Pair-Share:_ The life cycle of a flowering plant could be
described as going from seed to seed, and the life cycles of a frog and a
chicken, from egg to egg. How would you describe the life cycle of a butterfly?
( _Using that example, the life cycle of a butterfly could be described as going_
_from egg to egg. When the adult butterfly lays an egg, the life cycle begins. The_
_larva/caterpillar hatches from the egg; the larva/caterpillar molts several times_
_as it grows; the chrysalis/pupa forms; and finally the chrysalis/pupa splits open,_
_so the adult butterfly can emerge. The female lays eggs on a leaf to begin the life_
_cycle again._ )

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


The demonstration planned for the Application activity will take time
because evaporation and condensation must occur. A recommendation
to begin the activity in advance was made in the Advance Preparation
section of Lesson 1. Please plan to allow time to elapse between when
you fill the cup and place it in the bag and when your students make
observations. You may wish to fill the cup during the Introducing the
Read-Aloud activity and then make observations during the Application
activity. Alternatively, you could conduct the observations during the
Unit Review or Culminating Activities.


**Application**

 - Prepare to set up a miniature, indoor water cycle for students to observe.
Bring in a small, clear, plastic cup and a clear, plastic bag. Seal the bag.
If your classroom has a window, tape the bag to the window. If not, tape
the bag to a warm wall. Ask the students to predict what will happen.


**Universal Access**

 - Keep a cup of ice and a cup of water on hand throughout this lesson to show
students water in its solid and liquid states.

**Solid**

  - Explain that if something is a solid, it keeps its shape. Tell students that if you
pick up a book and hand it to someone else, it will still keep its same shape. It
keeps its shape because the book is a solid.


**Liquid**

  - Explain that if something is a liquid, it can be poured. It doesn’t keep its
shape, but takes on the shape of its container.


  - Show students two differently shaped, clear containers. Have students watch
as you pour water from one container to another. Tell students that water is a
liquid because it takes the shape of whatever container it is in.


**Gas**

  - Explain that if something is a gas, it is often hard to see. Explain that the air
around us is a gas. It is not solid because it does not keep its shape, and it is
not liquid because it cannot be poured.

**Solid to Liquid to Gas**

 - Explain that heat can change things from solids to liquids to gases.
Tell students that an ice cube is the solid form of water. When heated, an
ice cube can melt and become water. When we boil water, it heats up and
becomes water vapor, which is a gas.


 - Tell students the water on Earth goes through a cycle called the water cycle.
During the water cycle, water can go through all three states, solid, liquid,

~~**“THE WATER CYCLE” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 9A-1: Water**

Every day, all around you, an extraordinary

natural cycle is happening. It is called the

water cycle. Most of the water that has ever

existed on our planet is still here and is being

moved from one place to another. It moves





from the oceans and land to the sky above

us, and it moves from one part of the world to


|Col1|Col2|
|---|---|
||**9A-1**|



another. It has done this for millions and millions of years. The rain that falls

on you has been **recycled** many, many times over many millions of years.


**Show Image 9A-2: Water states**

Water is the main source of life. More than

two-thirds of Earth’s surface is covered with

water. That’s a good thing because all living

things need water to survive. Approximately

ninety-seven percent of the water on Earth





is in the oceans. ~~_That means most of Earth’s_~~

~~_water is found in the oceans._~~ The rest is in



lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, beneath the ground, or in its frozen state in

the form of glaciers and polar ice. There is also water that you cannot see in

the air around you, called water vapor. Therefore, water not only moves from

Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops


place to place, but it can exist in three states of matter. It can be a liquid,

a solid, and a gas. Oceans and rivers contain water in liquid form, glaciers

and the ice you put in drinks contain water in frozen, solid form, and the air

contains water as a gas called water vapor.


**Show Image 9A-3: Evaporation,**

**condensation, precipitation**

The water cycle has three main phases:

**evaporation**, **condensation**, and

**precipitation** . Water changes its form based

on the temperature, and whether it is being





heated or cooled. In the winter, when it is cold,

many people experience days in which snow



falls from the sky. The snow covers the land, and icicles hang down from

the roofs of houses. But then, as spring arrives and the weather becomes

warmer, the snow and ice melt into puddles. The puddles slowly disappear

as the warm sunshine causes the water to evaporate. Through the process of

evaporation, the warmth of the sun changes liquid water into a gas known as

water vapor. Water vapor is carried up into the air. The hotter it is, the more

quickly evaporation happens. ~~_Boiling water also creates water vapor. Have_~~

~~_you ever seen steam rising up from boiling water?_~~


Now let’s follow that water vapor as it rises up, higher and higher into the sky.

As it rises up, it is blown about by the wind, and it moves through the air, or

atmosphere. In other words, water vapor may be carried by the wind far away

from the place where it was once a puddle ~~_or even in a lake, river, or ocean_~~ .


**Show Image 9A-4: Condensation**

Water vapor in the air far below the clouds is

called **humidity** . When there is a lot of water in

the air, we say it is humid. At different times of

the year, there are different amounts of water

in the air. Warm air can hold more water vapor





than cold air. That is why on a hot summer’s

day, if there is a lot of moisture in the air, you



will often hear people talk about the humidity.


Water vapor high in the atmosphere ~~_or way up in the sky_~~ forms clouds as it

becomes water droplets. The wind carries the water vapor higher and higher

into the atmosphere where the temperatures are much cooler. As the vapor

cools, it changes back from a gas into water droplets, which form clouds.


Lesson 9 The Water Cycle
**129**


When water changes from a gas into a liquid, this process is called

condensation. Because cold air cannot hold as much water vapor as hot

air, condensation happens high up in the sky, or atmosphere, where it is

very cold. Condensation causes clouds to form. In other words, water vapor

becomes water droplets.


**Show Image 9A-5: Dark clouds**

As the tiny water droplets are blown about

by the wind, they crash into each other. They

join together to form larger water droplets. As

this bumping and crashing of water droplets

continues, clouds are formed. Eventually, when





water droplets in clouds become too large and

too heavy, they fall back down to the ground.



~~_The darker the cloud, the more rain or snow will probably fall._~~ Depending on the

temperature high up in the atmosphere, the water droplets either fall as rain,

sleet, snow, or hail. When water droplets fall to the ground, regardless of what

they look like, this is called precipitation. ~~_So is snow precipitation? Is rain?_~~


**Show Image 9A-6: Types of precipitation**

So down comes the rain, or snow, or hail, or

sleet. It waters the earth and falls into the

oceans, lakes, rivers, streams, and ponds.

Some of the precipitation seeps into the

ground, too. This groundwater nourishes





plants. It also provides a source of fresh

drinking water. Many people have wells that


|Col1|Col2|
|---|---|
||**9A-6**|



access the underground water supply. ~~_How do you think people get the water_~~

~~_that is stored under the ground?_~~


**Show Image 9A-7: Water cycle**

Once precipitation occurs, the process

starts all over again. Water on Earth

evaporates and rises up into the

atmosphere as water vapor. As it cools

or condenses, clouds form once again.





**130**



Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops


**Show Image 9A-8: Types of clouds**

Clouds are much more than fun shapes in

the sky. Without clouds, there would be no

precipitation, such as snow, sleet, hail, or rain.

Without precipitation, nothing could live or

grow on Earth. Clouds also provide a kind of

shelter or protection from the sun. Without

clouds it would be very, very hot during the



day and extremely cold at night. This would make it difficult for living things

to survive. Clouds help control the temperature on our planet. Scientists

group clouds according to their shape and height in the sky.


**Show Image 9A-9: Cirrus clouds**

Cirrus [/seer* ə s/] clouds form at very high

altitudes in the atmosphere. ~~_The word_~~ ~~cirrus~~

~~_means “curl of hair” in Latin. Can you see why_~~

~~_cirrus clouds have this name?_~~ They are wispy,

almost feather-like in appearance, and are





usually a sign of good weather. These clouds

can be up to four miles above the ground. The



temperature is very cold that high up in the atmosphere and so cirrus clouds

are made largely of ice crystals.


**Show Image 9A-10: Cumulus clouds**

Cumulus [/kyoo*my ə *l ə s/] clouds gather in

the sky on nice, sunny days. ~~_The word_~~ ~~cumulus~~

~~_means “heap,” or “a bunch of,” in Latin. Can_~~

~~_you see why cumulus clouds have this name?_~~

Cumulus clouds appear lower down in the sky,





although they are still about two miles above

the ground. Cumulus clouds are round and



fluffy-looking. Some people think they look like cotton. They are a sign that

the weather is going to get colder. However, when cumulus clouds get larger

and darker, this can mean that there will be a thunderstorm.

The appearance of stratus clouds means that

you will probably need an umbrella because it

is going to rain. ~~_The word_~~ ~~stratus~~ ~~_means “layer”_~~

~~_in Latin. Can you see why stratus clouds have_~~

~~_this name?_~~ They are usually gray, and they can

cover the whole sky and block the sun. Stratus

clouds form lower down in the atmosphere

than cirrus or cumulus clouds.



**132**



The temperature affects whether the clouds contain ice crystals or water

droplets. The clouds that are high up, in the colder reaches of Earth’s

atmosphere, are made up of sparkling ice crystals. The clouds that are lower

down, where it is warmer, are made up of tiny water droplets.


The next time you look up at the clouds, see if you can figure out what kind of

clouds they are, and then think about the amazing water cycle!


Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. Literal. Is the earth covered mostly by land or by water? _(The earth is_
_covered mostly by water._ )


Check for Understanding


**Show Poster 7 (water cycle)**


**Turn and Talk:** Describe the water cycle. ( _evaporation: when water_
_from oceans, rivers, and puddles changes to gas; condensation: when_
_water vapor turns back into a liquid or water droplets, turning into_
_clouds; precipitation: when water falls from the sky in the form of_
_rain, snow, hail, etc.; this starts the water cycle all over again)_


2. Literal. Water can be a solid, a liquid, or a gas. What do we call water when it
is a gas? ( _When water is a gas, it is called water vapor._ )


3. Inferential. Why are the processes of evaporation, condensation, and
precipitation considered a cycle? ( _They are considered a cycle because they_
_happen again and again in the same order._ ) What is the name of this cycle?
( _This cycle is called the water cycle._ )


4. Literal. Where does precipitation go after it falls from the clouds?
( _After it falls, precipitation goes into the ground or back into oceans,_
_rivers, and streams._ )


5. Literal. Does the earth make new water, or does the same water go through
the water cycle again and again? ( _The same water cycles again and again._ )


6. Evaluative. _Think-Pair-Share:_ Why is precipitation important?
( _Answers may vary, but should include that precipitation replenishes_
_the earth’s water supply._ )

Unit 5 Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops


**Gathering Leaves**
Robert Frost


Spades take up leaves
No better than spoons,
And bags full of leaves
Are light as balloons.


I make a great noise
Of rustling all day
Like rabbit and deer
Running away.


But the mountains I raise
Elude my embrace,
Flowing over my arms
And into my face.


I may load and unload
Again and again
Till I fill the whole shed,
And what have I then?


Next to nothing for weight,
And since they grew duller
From contact with earth,
Next to nothing for color.


Next to nothing for use,
But a crop is a crop,
And who’s to say where
The harvest shall stop?





**149**


**The Fieldmouse**
Cecil Frances Alexander


Where the acorn tumbles down
Where the ash tree sheds its berry,
With your fur so soft and brown,
With your eye so round and merry,
Scarcely moving the long grass,
Fieldmouse, I can see you pass.


Little thing, in what dark den,
Lie you all the winter sleeping
Till warm weather comes again?
Then once more I see you peeping
Round about the tall tree roots,
Nibbling at their fallen fruits.


Fieldmouse, fieldmouse, do not go,
Where the farmer stacks his treasure,
Find the nut that falls below,
Eat the acorn at your pleasure,
But you must not steal the grain
He has stacked with so much pain.


Make your hole where mosses spring,
Underneath the tall oak’s shadow,
Pretty, quiet, harmless thing,
Play about the sunny meadow,
