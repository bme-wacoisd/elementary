##### Introduction


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching the _Stories of the_
_Ancient Greeks_ unit. The Teacher Guide for _Stories of the Ancient Greeks_ contains nine daily lessons, each
of which is composed of three distinct parts, so that the lesson may be divided into smaller chunks of time
and presented at different intervals during the day. The entire lesson will require a total of sixty minutes.


This unit includes a two-day Pausing Point following Lesson 6. At the end of the unit, a Unit Review, a
Unit Assessment, and Culminating Activities are included to allow time to review, reinforce, assess,
and remediate content knowledge. You should spend no more than fourteen days total on this unit.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


At the back of this Teacher Guide, you will find a section titled “Teacher Resources.” In this section
you will find the following:


  - Activity Book Answer Key


  - Measures of Text Complexity


  - Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Correlation Chart


  - English Language Proficiency Standards Correlation Chart


~~**UNIT COMPONENTS**~~


Along with this Teacher Guide, you will need the:


  - Flip Book for _Stories of the Ancient Greeks_


  - Image Cards for _Stories of the Ancient Greeks_


  - Activity Book for _Stories of the Ancient Greeks_


  - Digital Components for _Stories of the Ancient Greeks_


  - Unit 2 Flip Book Poster 1 (map of ancient Greece)


  - Unit 2 The Civilizations Chart


All instructional materials can also be found in the program’s online materials.


Introduction

~~**ADDITIONAL RESOURCES**~~


You should consider various times throughout the day when you might infuse the curriculum with
authentic unit-related literature. In addition, you may recommend that families read aloud with their
student each night and you may suggest that they choose titles to reinforce the concepts covered in this
unit. You might also consider creating a classroom lending library, allowing students to borrow unitrelated books to read at home with their families.


~~**WHY STORIES OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS ARE IMPORTANT**~~


This unit builds on the _Stories of the Ancient Greeks_ unit and will introduce students to several wellknown Greek myths and characters. Students will learn that the ancient Greeks believed in many
gods and goddesses, and that the twelve they believed lived on Mount Olympus, the home of the
gods, were the most powerful. Students will learn the definition of a myth: a fictional story, once
thought to be true, that tried to explain mysteries of nature and humankind. The Greek Myths help
reveal some of the human traits that magnify or defeat one’s ability to govern themselves or provide
leadership with well ordered restraint. They will also learn about myths that include supernatural
beings or events, and that myths give insight into the ancient Greek culture. Students will hear
about Prometheus and Pandora, Demeter and Persephone, Arachne the Weaver, and Hercules,
among others.


References to Greek mythology are still culturally relevant today, and this unit will give students a
frame of reference with which to understand literary allusions and the meanings of common words
and expressions, such as _herculean_ . It will also better enable them to understand modern retellings
of these ancient stories.


You may want to remind students periodically that these myths are fiction. Please preview all ReadAlouds and lessons in this unit before presenting them to students. As you read, use the same
strategies that you have been using when reading the Read-Aloud selections in this Teacher Guide—
pause and ask occasional questions; rapidly clarify critical vocabulary within the context of the
Read-Aloud; etc.


The text that students will be reading and discussing in this unit provides opportunities for students to
build content knowledge and draw connections to social studies. You may build on class discussions
to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strand of Geography from the
Social Studies TEKS. This content is not a replacement for grade-level social studies instruction. For
more information about the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity
of the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.

**2**


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED**~~


The following units, and the specific core content that was targeted in those units, are particularly
relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _Stories of the Ancient Greeks_ . This background
knowledge will greatly enhance students’ understanding of the Read-Alouds they are about to enjoy:


**Fairy Tales and Folktales (Kindergarten)**


**Kings and Queens (Kindergarten)**


**Seasons and Weather: As the Earth Turns (Kindergarten)**


**Sharing Stories (Grade 1)**


**Astronomy: Space Exploration (Grade 1)**


~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR STORIES OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _Stories of the Ancient Greeks_ in
the forms in which they appear in the unit. These words appear in the Read-Alouds or, in some
instances, in the “Introducing the Read-Aloud” section at the beginning of the lesson. Boldfaced
words in the list have an associated Word Work activity. The inclusion of the words on this list
does not mean that students are immediately expected to be able to use all of these words on
their own. However, through repeated exposure throughout all lessons, they should acquire a good
understanding of most of these words and begin to use some of them in conversation.

Unit 3 Stories of the Ancient Greeks
**4**


~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit students will practice collecting and synthesizing information by using note-taking
tools such as charts and graphic organizers. In the first half of the unit, students will write a brief
summary of a Greek myth in preparation for writing their own Greek myth later in the unit. Students
will also work independently to write a fictional narrative in the style of a Greek myth. They will
build upon their learning from Unit 2, _Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government_, by including a
character. They will gain new experience developing a plot with a beginning, middle, and end. During
this project they will use the writing process to plan, draft, edit, publish, and share a short piece of
fictional writing. During the editing step, students will focus on editing drafts for prepositions and
prepositional phrases, correct use of pronouns, and using commas in a series and in dates.


**Writing Portfolio**


The following activities may be added to students’ writing portfolios:


  - Greek Myths Journal (multiple Activity Pages)


  - Summary of “Daedalus and Icarus” (Activity Page 6.2)


  - Somebody Wanted But So Then (Activity Page PP.2)


  - Greek Myth (Activity Pages 7.2, 8.1, 9.1)


  - Unit Assessment Part III (UA.3)


  - any additional writing completed during the Pausing Point, Unit Review, or Culminating Activities

Unit 3 Stories of the Ancient Greeks
**8**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Introducing the Read-Aloud**

  - Display Unit 2 Flip Book Poster 1 (map of ancient Greece) and Poster
3 (Mythical gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus). Keep this map
displayed throughout the unit to remind students of where Greek myths
originated.


  - You may wish to refer to the Civilization Chart from _the Ancient Greeks:_
_Life, Tradition, and Government_ unit to help students remember the various
components of this civilization.


**Read-Aloud**

  - Be sure to familiarize yourself with the names and traits of the twelve
mythical Greek gods and goddesses prior to this lesson so that you are able
to promptly answer a wide variety of student questions.


**Application**

  - Display the Posters of Mythological Characters 1–12 around the room where
students can clearly see them and where they can be referred to throughout
the unit.


**Note to Teacher**


You may wish to stick to a single definition of _myth_ as it applies to this unit:
A myth is a fictional story from ancient times that tries to explain events
or things in nature. A myth may also teach a lesson. A myth usually has
characters that are mythical gods or goddesses, humans, and creatures.


**Universal Access**


  - Throughout this unit, you may wish to assign one to two students to play
each mythical god or goddess during various Read-Alouds and activities.
Give the student(s) props to help them remember who their character is
and what he/she is known for. In addition, have students speak in different
voices for each character. This student or pair will become the expert on the
mythical god or goddess and can help peers remember key details about
them throughout the unit.


  - As you read the myths, create a Characters Chart similar to the one that follows

and fill in relevant information about the characters as they are introduced.
Students may use this as a reference when making notes in their journals.
Please note that most of the characters’ names are not decodable for students
in Grade 2 and students should not be expected to be able to read the names.
You may have some students who can read some of the names or who may
enjoy recognizing them as a result of the repetition throughout the unit as they
see the names, listen to the stories, and view the illustrations of characters. You


Lesson 1 Mount Olympus

will need to add additional rows to the chart for each lesson’s Read-Aloud.

Unit 3 Stories of the Ancient Greeks
**12**


~~**UNIT INTRODUCTION (10 MIN.)**~~


**What Do We Already Know About Fiction?**

  - Help students contrast the content from Unit 1: _Fairy Tales and Tall Tales_ and
Unit 2: _Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government_ .


    - You heard many fairy tales and tall tales in Unit 1. Were these stories fiction
or nonfiction? _(fiction)_


    - How could you tell they were fiction? _(they had made-up characters and_
_events; the events were not real; some of them were fantasy; etc.)_


    - You learned many things about the ancient Greek civilization in Unit 2.

Were the things you learned about the ancient Greeks fiction or
nonfiction? _(nonfiction)_


    - How could you tell they were nonfiction? _(they were true; they were things_

_that really happened; etc.)_


**What Are Myths?**


**Note:** Students who participated in the program in Grade 1 will have heard
about myths in the _Astronomy: Space Exploration_ unit and learned how many
different ancient peoples told myths about the stars and constellations they
saw in the sky. You may wish to solicit their knowledge of this topic to share
with the class.


  - Discuss the following facts about myths with students:


    - Like people in many civilizations, the ancient Greeks told stories orally, or

spread them by word of mouth.


    - These stories usually had mythical beings or heroes as the main
characters. Who is a mythical or heroic character you know?


    - Myths have characters with supernatural abilities. Supernatural abilities

are like superpowers, that we can’t explain with our knowledge of how
things work. The supernatural characters in these myths are not real, and
these stories are fiction.


    - The plots of these stories usually explained events in nature or taught

people how to behave. Who did the ancient Greeks believe caused
lightning? _(Zeus)_


    - In ancient times people did not have the knowledge that people have

today. As a result, these stories, which were later written down, were first
thought to be factual, or true and real. But it is now known that they are
fictional, or not true.


    - We call such oral stories myths.

- Tell students that over the next couple of weeks, they are going to hear many
well-known Greek myths that originated in ancient Greece.


  - These myths include several fascinating characters, many of whom are
mythical gods and goddesses who the ancient Greeks believed in.


- Show students Poster 3 (Mythical gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus)
from _Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government_ unit.


- Ask students what they remember about mythical gods and goddesses from
_Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government_ unit. You may wish to prompt
them with the following questions:


  - Of the mythical gods and goddesses, which are male beings and which
are female beings? _(The mythical gods are male beings, and the mythical_
_goddesses are female beings.)_


  - Where did the mythical Greek gods and goddesses live, according to the
ancient Greeks? Show me the location on _Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition,_
_and Government_ Poster 1. _(The Greeks believed that the most powerful_
_of these mythical gods and goddesses lived in a palace on the very top of_
_Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece.)_


  - Who did the ancient Greeks believe ruled these mythical gods and
goddesses? _(a king named Zeus and a queen named Hera)_


  - Name a mythical god or goddess and describe what was special about him
or her. _(Answers may vary, but students should draw on their knowledge_
_from Unit 2.)_


  - What do you think the mythical gods and goddesses thought about each
other? _(Answers may vary, but students should draw on their knowledge_
_from Unit 2.)_


Check for Understanding


What are Greek myths? Are they fiction or nonfiction? _(stories_

people at the races, and when they had sold all they could, they would watch

the races. ~~_Pottery is the name for vases, pots, bowls, or plates shaped from_~~

~~_moist clay and hardened by heat. Many groups of people have made pottery_~~

harnessed the second horse. Once they double-checked that the horses were

**securely** ~~_or tightly_~~ fastened to the cart, Leonidas and Cyrus finished storing

their pottery safely in the cart. Then, taking their seats on a wooden plank ~~_or_~~

~~_thick board_~~ at the front of the cart, they started their journey to Olympia.


**Show Image 1A-3: Leonidas’s father pointing**
**to Mount Olympus**

~~_How do you think Leonidas feels about going to_~~

~~_Olympia to see the races held in honor of Zeus?_~~

After they’d traveled some miles down the

road, Leonidas asked, “Father, will you tell me







again the story of the gods and goddesses?”


“Of course, son. As you know, we’re going to



Olympia for the footraces held in honor of Zeus. Olympia is the home of an

important **sanctuary** devoted to Zeus, where we celebrate him and the other

Olympian gods and goddesses with sporting competitions. ~~_A sanctuary is a_~~

~~_special, holy place._~~ The twelve gods of Mount Olympus are the most powerful of

all the gods, and Zeus is their leader. Of course, Mount Olympus is actually far

away, but this is a beautiful valley, beloved to them and perfect for the games.”

Their cart went over a bump, and Cyrus turned around to check their wares

briefly before continuing the story. ~~_Wares are goods that are sold to people._~~

~~_What wares did Cyrus and Leonidas have in their cart?_~~ “These gods and

goddesses can sometimes be just like you and me: they can feel happy or

sad, jealous and angry, or generous and loving. Unlike you or me, they have

special powers to control things like the seasons and the weather, when and

where there is war, and sometimes, with whom we fall in love!”


**Show Image 1A-4: Olympians on their**

Cyrus paused before continuing on with

Leonidas’s favorite part of the story. “That’s

how the gods are different from humans on

Earth. Do you know how to tell them apart





from one another?”



**Show Image 1A-5: Zeus and Poseidon**

Cyrus continued on, saying, “Well, as I said

before, Zeus is the leader of all the gods and

protects all of us here on Earth. He has a voice

like rolling thunder and controls the wind,

rain, and lightning, which he also uses as his





weapons. Zeus became the leader because

he won a war against the old mythological



beings called Titans. The Titans had many powers, but Zeus banished them

to a gloomy dark place far away from Mount Olympus. He has two brothers,

Hades and Poseidon, and together they rule over the whole world. While

Zeus controls the heavens, Poseidon controls the sea and rules over it with

a trident. ~~_Who can point to the trident in the illustration?_~~ When he strikes the

ground with his trident, the earth shakes, and when he strikes the seas with

it, the waves rise up as tall as a mountain. Zeus and Poseidon are two of the

twelve gods who live on Mount Olympus and have thrones there.”


Leonidas and his father came to a fork in the road and turned left. They could

now see other carts ahead of them in the distance—other vendors looking to

sell their wares at the footraces in Olympia.

guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses: “I saw spectators
once when . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** Spectators are people who
watch events. What is a word for people who participate in an event? Hint: It
is similar to the word _participate_ . _(participants)_ Participants and observers

**Epimetheus creating**

Long, long ago there were two brothers

named Prometheus [/pr ə *mee*thee* ə s/]

and Epimetheus [/ep* ə *mee*thee* ə s/].

Prometheus and Epietheus were Titans, a group

of immortals that ruled the Earth before Zeus and

the Olympians. Their names fit them perfectly.

Prometheus means “ **foresight,** ” or “thinking ahead,” in Greek, and Epimetheus

means “ **hindsight**,” or “thinking afterward.”


Prometheus was quite clever and was always planning ahead in an effort to

make things better for himself and for those around him. On the other hand,

his brother, Epimetheus, was always doing foolish things without thinking.

~~_What does_~~ ~~foolish~~ ~~_mean? Which brother thinks ahead? Which brother is foolish_~~

~~_and does not think ahead?_~~


The ancient Greeks believed that it was Prometheus who first created human

beings and that it was his brother who made all of the other creatures. Zeus gave

the two brothers gifts to give the living things. So while Prometheus scooped up

some river clay and began to make human beings in the likeness of the gods,

~~_or to look like the gods_~~ his brother Epimetheus made all sorts of animals and

gave them all the good gifts. The animals could see, smell, and hear better than

humans, and they had fur to keep them warm, unlike man, who shivered in

the cold. ~~_[Point to Prometheus in the picture. (He is sculpting a man.) Point to_~~

~~_Epimetheus. (He is sculpting an animal.)] How were the animals that were created_~~

~~_by Epimetheus different from the humans that were created by Prometheus?_~~

~~(They had better gifts, like fur to keep them warm and better eyesight, sense of~~

~~smell, and a better sense of hearing.)~~


**Show Image 2A-2: Zeus complimenting**

**Epimetheus and questioning Prometheus**

Zeus, king of the gods, noticed all of these

new animal creatures hopping, swimming,

flying, growing, and walking on the earth.

Zeus told Epimetheus, “These toys of yours

are quite **amusing** ~~_or funny_~~ . Some of them

make me laugh, like that—what did you call

it—‘elephant’? What an imagination you have! Others are quite beautiful in

their own way. This morning I was watching your dolphins leap and play in the

water. They are very graceful ~~_or smooth and elegant in their movement_~~ .”


To Prometheus he said, “But these humans of yours . . . what good are they?

The other creatures are bigger, faster, or stronger. Humans just sit around. I

think you should get rid of them and try something else.”


Prometheus, however, had something in mind when he created humans. He

suggested, “Please be patient, great Zeus. I think you will be surprised and

pleased at how quickly humans can learn and how useful they can be. Why, I

plan to teach them to pray to you! Wouldn’t you like that?”


Zeus agreed that this sounded like a fine idea. “Very well, I will give humans time

to prove they are worthy ~~_or useful and valuable_~~ . If they do not do so, however, you

will have to get rid of them.” ~~_What do you think is going to happen?_~~


**Show Image 2A-3: Prometheus asking Zeus**

**for fire for the humans**

Prometheus felt sorry for the humans, though.

They had no fur to keep them warm, nothing

to light the darkness, and nothing with which

to cook their food. Humans needed fire,

especially if they were to prove themselves.

Challenge


Ask students to
explain how Zeus
and Prometheus
thought about
humans differently.


Support


Refer to the posters of

Zeus and Hephaestus



He asked Zeus for this gift for the humans, but Zeus refused. “Fire,” he said,

“is just for the gods.” ~~_Who, according to Greek mythology, is the god of fire?_~~

~~(Hephaestus, the blacksmith of the mythical gods)~~



on display in the



Prometheus knew the humans needed fire. “With fire,” he thought to himself,
classroom.



“they can soften metal and bend it into shapes to make tools. With these



tools they can plow fields, fish and hunt for food, cook that food, and build

shelters in which to live. Human beings need fire, but getting it for them will

be very dangerous.”


**Show Image 2A-4: Prometheus stealing fire**

**from Mount Olympus**

Prometheus knew that up on Mount Olympus,

where most of the gods lived, there was one

carefully guarded fire. The gods and goddesses

used this fire to cook their food. From this





same fire, however, came the dangerous

lightning bolts that Zeus would fling through



**32**



the sky. In fact, all fire came from this one source.


Zeus had said, “Fire is too dangerous for these **ridiculous** humans to use

wisely. Only we shall have it.” ~~_The word_~~ ~~ridiculous~~ ~~_means laughable or silly._~~

~~_Why do you think Zeus thinks the humans are ridiculous?_~~ Yet Prometheus was

determined to bring fire to humans, even if it meant disobeying the king of

the gods. ~~_What is the conflict between Zeus and Prometheus?_~~


Prometheus picked a stalk of fennel ~~_an edible plant with small yellow flowers_~~

and carried it up to Mount Olympus. When no one was looking, he dropped a

burning coal from the fire into the plant’s hollow center, where no one could

see it. Then he carried the plant, with the fire hidden inside, down to the

earth. ~~_How do you think Zeus is going to react when he finds out Prometheus_~~

~~_disobeyed him?_~~


**Show Image 2A-5: Enraged Zeus standing**

Not long after that, Zeus noticed smoke rising

from the earth. Gazing down in amazement,

he saw that humans were now doing all sorts

of wonderful new things. Zeus thought, “It

seems human beings really are worth keeping

around.” At the same time, however, he was furious when he found out that

humans possessed ~~_or had_~~ fire when he himself had forbidden this.


Guessing at once who was responsible, Zeus promised, “I will teach

Prometheus and these human beings of his that they must obey me. And I

know exactly how to do it.”


Soon after this, Zeus decided on the punishment for Prometheus. For the

rest of time, Prometheus was chained to the side of a mountain. This served

as a warning to anyone who thought about disobeying Zeus in the future.


**Show Image 2A-6: Zeus and the mythical**

**gods creating Pandora with her gifts**

Now, Zeus was still angry that humans had fire,

but he decided to let them keep it and instead

punish man in another way. “To punish man,

I will create a special box. Opening this box

will have unpleasant results. I will need a new

human to bring this box to man.”


Zeus ordered one of the gods to create this new human. He then asked each

of the gods and goddesses for some wonderful quality or talent for this new

human, explaining, “I want someone who possesses all of the most wonderful

characteristics. I shall name her ‘Pandora.’”


The name Pandora means “all gifts.” The gods gave her the gifts of beauty,

intelligence, curiosity, and persuasion. ~~_Persuasion is the ability to make_~~

~~_someone agree with your opinion._~~

**Stoplight:** This is a long Read-Aloud. Let’s check to make sure
you remember what has happened so far.


      - What did Prometheus create? _(humans)_


      - What caused conflict between Prometheus and Zeus? ( _giving_
_fire to humans_ )


      - Why did Zeus have a mythical god create Pandora? _(to deliver a_
_box to punish man)_

**Show Image 2A-7: Curious Pandora coming**
**down to Earth with a sealed box**


Zeus finally sent Pandora down to the earth

with the closed box as a gift to Epimetheus.

Before sending Pandora, Zeus warned her to

never open the box. Pandora, however, desired

to know what was in the box. She fought

against her curiosity, but day after day, night

after night, the question nibbled away at her. Pandora would often sit and

look at the box, wondering, wanting to open it, but always stopping herself.

~~_Do you think Pandora is going to open the box? What would you do?_~~


One day, when none of the housekeepers or servants were around, Pandora

went to gaze at the box. ~~_Based on the way it is used in this sentence, what_~~

~~_do you think_~~ ~~gaze~~ ~~_means?_~~ Finally she thought, “Surely one little peek cannot

hurt.” She stood up and studied the closed box one last time before she took

a deep breath and opened the lid. ~~_What do you think is going to happen next?_~~


**Show Image 2A-8: Pandora opening the box**

Out of the box burst all of the frightening,

saddening, anger-causing, **terrifying** evils

and sorrows. ~~_The word_~~ ~~terrifying~~ ~~_means_~~

~~_frightening, or full of terror._~~ Greed, hate, anger,

pain, disease, disaster, and death swarmed

from the box and around Pandora. She tried to

shove them back inside, but she was too late.

Out they flew in all directions. ~~_How do you think Pandora felt when all of these_~~

~~_terrible things burst out of the box?_~~


By the time Pandora was able to replace the lid back on the box, only one

thing remained: hope.

~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


Check for Understanding


       - Myths often try to explain how things came to be in the world.
What does this myth attempt to explain? _(how humans and_
_animals were created; how evil and sorrow came into the world)_


       - What is created in this myth? _(humans and animals)_


       - What is released from the box in this myth? _(evil and sorrow)_


**Show Image 2A-1: Prometheus and Epimetheus creating**


1. Literal. According to Greek mythology, who made the first creatures?
( _Prometheus made humans/men, Epimetheus made all other animals)_


2. Literal. Prometheus steals fire for humans so they can prove themselves to
Zeus. What punishments for stealing the fire does Zeus deliver? _(he chains_
_Prometheus to a mountain; he sends Pandora with a closed box filled with_
_unpleasant things to the humans)_

    - Literal. What does Zeus do to punish the humans? _(He sends Pandora_
_with a closed box filled with unpleasant things.)_


**Show Image 2A-8: Pandora opening the box**


3. Literal. Zeus sends Pandora down to Earth with a closed box and strict
instructions not to open it. What does Pandora do with the box and what
happens? ( _Pandora can’t resist and opens the box. Frightening and terrifying_
_evils and sorrows come out of the box to cause people pain.)_


4. Evaluative. _Think-Pair-Share:_ There is an expression that warns people
against opening “Pandora’s box.” What do you think that expression means?
How is it related to this myth? _(This expression means that something is a_
_source of unexpected troubles and pain, and it is best to try to avoid it, no_
_matter how tempting it is to look inside or open it. Pandora could have avoided_
_pain and trouble by not opening the box.)_

    - **Inferential.** What might be another example of opening “Pandora’s Box”?

_(Answers may vary but could include something like opening a gate that_
_says “No Trespassing” or stepping on an icy pond.)_

**Show Image 3A-1: Mythical Greek gods Poseidon,**
**Ares, Aphrodite, Persephone, and Demeter**

As you have learned, the ancient Greeks believed

that there were many gods and goddesses

responsible for the workings of the world. There

was Poseidon, the mythical god of the sea; Ares,

the mythical god of war; and Aphrodite, the

mythical goddess of love, to name a few.


Demeter [/d ə *mee*ter/] ~~_[Point to Demeter in the right foreground of the_~~

~~_picture.]_~~ was the mythical goddess of the harvest and agriculture, or farming.

It was because of her, the ancient Greeks believed, that fruits hung heavy on

the trees, wheat grew in the fields, and vegetables ripened on the ground.

~~_Remember you learned in the_~~ ~~Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government~~

~~_unit that Demeter was the mythical goddess who, at Athena’s request, made_~~

~~_the olive trees green, plentiful, and strong for the ancient Greeks._~~

Demeter had a daughter named Persephone [/per*sef* ə *nee/], who was the

joy of her life. Persephone was known by all of the gods and goddesses on Mount

Olympus as a beautiful girl—just like her mother—and like her mother, she was full

of happiness, warmth, and light. As long as the two of them were together, it was

summer year round.

Unit 3 Stories of the Ancient Greeks


**Show Image 3A-2: Demeter tending fields**

**and Persephone straying**

Some days, Demeter would take Persephone

with her to tend to the crops in the fields. On

these days, Demeter would work among the

crops, and Persephone would play in a nearby

field of flowers picking bouquets. ~~_Who can_~~

~~_point to the bouquet in the illustration?_~~ One

such day, Persephone strayed farther and farther away from her mother,

until, humming a little tune, Persephone was far out of Demeter’s sight.


Now, Persephone was not just known by the gods and goddesses on Mount

Olympus. Hades, Zeus’s brother and the mythical god of the underworld,

had also taken notice of her. As mythical god of the underworld, Hades

lived underground and oversaw all of the souls of the dead. He and his

three-headed dog, Cerberus [/ser*ber* ə s/], saw to it that none of the dead

escaped back to the land of the living.


**Show Image 3A-3: Hades taking Persephone**

**down to the underworld**

Hades wanted Persephone to be the queen of

the underworld. On that day, as Persephone

drifted away from her mother, Hades

harnessed his four black horses to his golden

chariot. As Persephone bent to pick up one

last flower, she could hear the faint sounds

of hooves beating. Persephone stood up and looked around. As she did,

Hades tore open the ground that separated the underworld from the land

of the living and grabbed Persephone. He **spirited** her away, back to the

underworld in his chariot. ~~_The word_~~ ~~spirited~~ ~~_means carried off mysteriously_~~

~~_or secretly. Why did Hades spirit Persephone away?_~~ ~~(He wanted to make her~~

~~his queen.)~~


**Show Image 3A-4: Demeter searching for**
**Persephone**

As the sun began to set, Demeter finally

stopped her work in the fields. “Persephone!”

she called out, ready to take her daughter

home. There was no answer. Thinking that

perhaps Persephone had not heard her, she

and excited.


called out again. Demeter heard nothing but the chirps of evening crickets,

and then she began to worry. Demeter searched all night, calling for her

daughter, but no matter where she looked or how loudly she called, she could

not find Persephone.


As the night wore on, Demeter began to look older. Wrinkles formed on her face,

her body grew crooked, and she moved more and more slowly. By the time the

sun came up the next day, Demeter was no longer full of happiness, warmth, and

light, but was filled with despair, moving listlessly, her only interest in finding her

daughter. ~~_How do you think Demeter feels?_~~ In her night of searching, Demeter

had not found Persephone, and so she turned to the sun god, Helios

[/ **hee** *lee*oes/]—who during the day sees all—and asked for help.


**Show Image 3A-5: Helios and Demeter**

“Oh, Helios,” Demeter said, “have you seen my

daughter, Persephone? Do you know where

she has gone?”


“Hades has taken her down to the underworld





to be his queen,” Helios replied.


Upon hearing this, Demeter began to **despair**



**46**



~~_or give up hope_~~ . How was she to ever **retrieve** ~~_or bring back_~~ her daughter

now? Demeter began to weep for her lost daughter, and in her sadness she

forgot to tend to the crops in the fields. The grass turned brown, the wheat

stopped growing, and soon there was no more food on the earth for the

animals and people to eat. Every tree, vine, and field was bare. Even the gods

received no more offerings, for the people did not have any food or meat to

spare. ~~_Humans offered food to the mythical gods and goddesses as gifts to_~~

~~_show their appreciation, and/or to keep them happy. What is the conflict in_~~

~~_this myth?_~~


**Show Image 3A-6: Zeus talking to Hades in**

**the underworld**

After some time, Zeus saw that the people

would starve if something was not done.

Only gods and goddesses could go to the

underworld and then leave, so Zeus traveled

to the underworld to persuade Hades to let

Persephone go. ~~Persuade~~ ~~_is another form_~~

~~_of the word_~~ ~~persuasion~~ ~~_, which you heard in the last Read-Aloud was one of_~~

~~_Pandora’s gifts. What does_~~ ~~persuade~~ ~~_mean?_~~ ~~(to convince)~~


Unit 3 Stories of the Ancient Greeks


“Hades,” he said, “if you do not return Persephone to her mother, Demeter,

nothing will grow on the earth again. The people will starve.” ~~_Why will nothing_~~

~~_grow on earth unless Persephone returns?_~~ ~~(because Demeter, who is the~~

~~mythical goddess of the harvest, is sad without Persephone and so crops are~~

~~not growing)~~


“I will gladly return her,” Hades said, “if she hasn’t eaten anything. You know

the rule, Zeus: whoever eats of the food of the underworld or drinks of its

water must stay forever.”


Zeus and Hades looked at Persephone, waiting for an answer. Had she eaten

the food of the underworld? Persephone began to cry. “I ate six pomegranate

seeds,” she said.


**Show Image Card 1: Pomegranate**

~~_A pomegranate is a fruit with a reddish rind that has many seeds enclosed in a_~~

~~_juicy pulp. What do you think is going to happen?_~~


A rule was a rule, but Zeus knew that if Persephone remained in the

underworld, nothing would grow on the earth again. So he made a deal with

Hades. “For each seed she has eaten, Persephone will stay one month in the

underworld as your queen. For the rest of the year, however, she will live on

Earth with her mother, Demeter.” ~~_How many seeds did Persephone eat? So_~~

~~_how many months of the year must she stay in the underworld? How many_~~

~~_months of the year will she live with Demeter?_~~


**Show Image 3A-7: Blooming world and barren**

And so it was that for six months of the year,

Demeter and Persephone were happy together.

Fruits, wheat, and other plants sprouted from

the ground, and it was spring. As they grew

**bountifully**, ~~_or in great amount_~~ the world was

bright, and it was summer.


During those six months that Persephone lived in the underworld, however,

Demeter would ignore all of the crops on Earth and would **pine** for ~~_or long to_~~

~~_have_~~ her daughter. The leaves would fall off the trees in autumn and would be

bare in winter, while Demeter longed for her daughter. Once Persephone was

returned to Demeter, it would be spring again.

~~**“ARACHNE THE WEAVER” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 4A-1: Arachne weaving**

Long ago, there lived among the Greeks a young

woman named Arachne [/ ə *rak*nee/], who

was a very gifted weaver. A weaver weaves or

spins threads or yarns together to make cloth.

Arachne wove upon a wooden frame called a

loom. She did not just weave solid colors; she

wove tapestries, wonderful woven pictures that

people would hang on their walls as art. ~~_What is a tapestry?_~~


People came from distant lands to see these masterpieces ~~_or great works_~~ in

Arachne’s studio. A visitor might comment, “This is amazing! Why, look at the

leaves on this tree. They look so real that you almost expect them to move

in the breeze. And this deer in the meadow looks as if he is going to turn and

bound ~~_or jump_~~ away.”


The visitors would tell Arachne, “You are the finest weaver in all the world!” But then

they would add, “Except, of course, for the goddess Athena, who invented weaving!”

Athena was actually the mythical goddess of all handicrafts, not just weaving.

Unit 3 Stories of the Ancient Greeks



**58**


People **flattered** ~~_or complimented_~~ Arachne by comparing her work to

Athena’s. At first Arachne was pleased with this comparison. But as years

passed, she began to get annoyed. She would say, “I’m sure Athena is

very talented, but look, did you see this one over here?” ~~_Why do you think_~~

~~_Arachne began to get annoyed?_~~ As still more years passed, whenever people

compared her to the goddess, Arachne would angrily say, “I don’t care if

Athena invented weaving. I think I am the best weaver in the world!” ~~_Do you_~~

~~_think this bragging might cause a problem for Arachne?_~~


**Show Image 4A-2: Athena transformed into**
**an old woman**

Word of this eventually reached the ears of

the goddess Athena on Mount Olympus. She

decided to visit Arachne’s studio to learn

if Arachne was truly saying such things.

However, Athena did not want Arachne to

recognize her, so with her magic, Athena

changed her own appearance from a beautiful, athletic young woman. Now,

with a wave of her hand and a puff of smoke, gone was the young woman,

replaced by a woman so old and bent with age that she had to lean on ~~_or rest_~~

~~_against_~~ a walking stick to get around. Of course, inside that body was still the

goddess Athena, but no one would have recognized her.


In this disguise she went to visit Arachne, commenting, “Your work is

extraordinary, my dear. ~~[or very special]~~ ~~_Does this mean Arachne’s work is_~~

~~_good or bad?_~~ I am certain that you are the finest weaver in the world—except,

of course, for the goddess Athena.”


Hearing this, Arachne, thinking she spoke to a bent, old woman, angrily

exclaimed, “I am sick of hearing about Athena. I say that I am the best weaver

in the world!”


**Show Image 4A-3: Arachne challenging**
**Athena**

Well, there was a puff of smoke, and when

it blew away, who did Arachne see standing

there with her but the beautiful goddess

Athena. Arachne was afraid of what Athena

might do to her, but she took a deep breath

and said, “I meant what I said. I am prepared to

**Show Image 4A-4: Athena and Arachne in**
**a weaving contest**

So the goddess and the young woman chose their

colors and started to weave. When at last they

stopped, Arachne grinned, for she truly believed

she had won. She pointed out all the wonderful





features ~~_or parts_~~ of her work to Athena.


“Look,” she said, “see how real the stream



**60**



looks tumbling down this hillside, and how the water reflects the colors of the

sunlight, as real water would do. And if you move over here to look, the colors

actually change, the way real sunlight would change.”


At last she turned to see Athena’s tapestry.


**Show Image 4A-5: Arachne overcome by grief**
**at the sight of Athena’s superior tapestry**

Arachne saw at once that the work of the

goddess was even finer than her own. Athena

had woven a stream, but hers seemed to ripple

and move. She had woven clouds that appeared

to float lightly in the sky, and above it all she had

woven the gods in all of their majesty. ~~_Do you_~~

~~_recognize any of the mythical Greek gods in Athena’s tapestry?_~~


Upset and embarrassed, Arachne turned and ran from the room. Athena

caught up with her, asking, “Where are you going?”


Arachne exclaimed, “I thought I was the best, but you are **superior** ~~_or far_~~

~~_better_~~ ~~;~~ and no matter how long and hard I work at it, I will never be as good

as you are. I shall never weave again.” ~~_Were your predictions about what_~~

~~_would happen correct? Why or why not?_~~


Then Athena grew **stern** ~~_or harsh and firm_~~ . “Everyone is born with some special

gift or talent, if only he or she can figure out what it is and how to use it. You

must not waste this skill of yours. We shall see to it that you shall weave again.”

Arachne began to change shape. She grew

smaller and smaller, and her body rounder

and rounder. Her legs and arms grew longer

and thinner until, after about five minutes,

Arachne had turned into the very first spider in the world. Today we call all

the members of the spider family **arachnids** [/ ə *rak*nidz/], and that is why

~~**SPIN A STORY (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that this activity is called “Spin a Story”. Spinning a story means
to create or make up a story.


 - To build background knowledge, explain to students that characters can
be described by their external (outward) traits and their internal (behavior,
thoughts, actions). Ask students to share an external character trait about
a character they read about in the first unit, _Fairy Tales_ and _Tall Tales_ . Use
Image 4A-1 to help students recognize and describe Arachne’s external traits.


 - Review the term _weaver_ using the following questions:


   - What did Arachne weave? _(tapestries)_


   - What is a tapestry? _(a woven image that can be hung on walls)_


 - Tell students that as a class, they are going to make a new kind of tapestry,
a tapestry that is woven of words and pictures. This tapestry will retell the
myth of Arachne the Weaver and represent her internal traits. Ask: What is an
internal trait?


 - Divide the class into five groups. Tell the class that there will be five parts to
this tapestry and that each of the five groups will be responsible for drawing
and describing one part. Tell students that Group One will draw and describe
the beginning scene of the myth, Groups Two through Four will draw and
describe scenes from the middle of the myth, and that Group Five will draw
and describe the ending scene of the myth.


 - Prior to having groups begin drawing, review the five main events of the story.
Use the chart below, “Arachne the Weaver” Class Tapestry Chart (Digital
Components), to guide your discussion. Write down descriptions of each
event as you discuss them.

  - Have each group work on a single drawing for their scene of the myth. Then,
have each student write a sentence or two describing their drawing.


  - As students discuss and create their illustrations, encourage them to use richer
and more complex language, including, if possible, any Read-Aloud vocabulary.


  - Have each group place their drawing in chronological order on the board or
chart paper. Encourage students to use the chart to help with assembling the
drawings to create the tapestry. Leave the tapestry on display to use in the
next lesson.


Check for Understanding ~~**TEKS 2.8.B**~~


**Circulate and Ask** Circulate to check that students’ drawings
depict the part of the story they were assigned. Ask students to
describe their drawings using the following questions:


       - Describe the difference between the character’s external and
internal character traits.


       - How does [character] feel in your drawing?


       - What is happening in your drawing?


      - Why did [event] happen?

“Black sails? Who is this King Minos, and what happens when his ship comes

to Athens?” asked Prince Theseus.


**Show Image 5A-2: Black-sailed ship**

His father answered, “King Minos, who rules

the great island of Crete, has the mightiest

navy and army on Earth. ~~_[Have a volunteer_~~

~~_point to the island of Crete on a world map or_~~

~~_globe.]_~~ Several years ago, his son was visiting

here in Athens. There was a terrible accident,

and the young man never returned to Crete.

I sent word to Crete explaining what had happened, and how sorry we were,

but King Minos would not listen. He and his warriors attacked and conquered

Athens. ~~_What event caused King Minos to attack Athens?_~~ Then Minos

announced, ‘You Athenians must share my sorrow. My son was eighteen

when he went to Athens. Every nine years I shall send to you a ship with black

sails. This ship will take seven of your Athenian men and seven Athenian

women, each my son’s age, to Crete. There I shall send those Athenians into

the **labyrinth** [/lab* ə *rinth/].’”


“What is ‘the Labyrinth,’ Father?” Theseus asked.

“It is an enormous maze of twisting tunnels

enters there. Many times King Minos has sent his black-sailed ship to carry

away seven of our young men and women, and none of them ever gets out

of the labyrinth. And now, next week the black-sailed ship will return.” ~~_What_~~

~~_happens every nine years when the ship with black sails arrives in Athens?_~~



Unit 3 Stories of the Ancient Greeks
**74**


**Show Image 5A-4: Theseus preparing to get**

**on the black-sailed ship with other youth**

Theseus said, “Father, you know my skills as a

warrior. I am eighteen years old. I will take the

place of one of these youths ~~_or young people_~~

and stop the Minotaur before it can strike

again.”


“No, my son! I will not let you risk your life,”

King Aegeus replied.


“Father, how can I let this continue when I know I can stop it? I am the person

with the best chance against the beast.” Finally, Theseus **convinced** ~~_or_~~

~~_persuaded_~~ his father and told him that if he was successful, he and the other

Athenians would return on King Minos’s ship with white sails.


A week later, the prince and the other young Athenians boarded King Minos’s

ship. When they reached the island of Crete, guards led them to King Minos’s

throne room in the palace. There, Minos **sneered**, ~~_or made a face showing_~~

~~_dislike_~~ “It is fitting that the son of the king of Athens should not return to his

home, as my son did not return to his.”


Theseus answered, “It is more fitting that the son of the king of Athens

should end this horrid business once and for all.” ~~_Do you think Theseus will be_~~

~~_successful?_~~


**Show Image 5A-5: Ariadne talking to**
**Daedalus**

Standing at King Minos’s side through all of

this was his daughter, Princess Ariadne

[/aer*ee*ad*nee/]. The princess was amazed

to see that Theseus was not afraid. She

thought, “What an extraordinary man! I must

save him. But how? Even I would not be safe

from my father’s fury ~~_or extreme anger_~~ if he found out.” Princess Ariadne

needed help, so she went to see the most brilliant man she knew, the man

who also happened to be the creator of the labyrinth—Daedalus. ~~_Daedalus_~~

~~_created the maze where the Minotaur lived._~~


Lesson 5 Theseus and the Minotaur
**75**


The clever Daedalus told her, “It is impossible to sneak a weapon into the

maze. The guards would find it and remove it, and eventually they would

trace it back to you. However, if the reports of Theseus’s bravery are true, he

may still have a chance fighting the Minotaur. Then at least we can help him

find his way back out of the labyrinth. Here is what you must do . . .” ~~_What_~~

~~_does Daedalus have in his hand? What do you think it’s for?_~~


**Show Image 5A-6: Ariadne advising Theseus**

**and giving him a ball of string**

That night, Princess Ariadne went to Theseus’s

room in her father’s palace. She told the young

hero, “Wind this ball of string around yourself

beneath your clothes so the guards will not

see it. After you enter the labyrinth, tie one

end of the thread to the handle of the gate

and unwind the rest as you go through the maze. If you defeat the Minotaur,

rewind the thread, and it will lead you back by the same route to the gate.

And if you succeed, you must take me with you to Athens, for if my father

finds that I have helped you . . .”


“Of course we will take you,” Theseus said. “Thank you, Princess.” ~~_What do_~~

~~_you think will happen next?_~~


**Show Image 5A-7: Theseus wandering**
**through the maze with string and other**

**Athenians**

The next day, after the guards closed the gates

of the labyrinth behind the Athenians, Theseus

told the others, “Wait here. I go to seek the

Minotaur. If I fail, you are no worse off; if I

succeed, we will all be able to return safely to

Athens.” Tying the thread to the door handle, **unraveling** it with each step,

Theseus set off into the labyrinth. ~~_The word_~~ ~~unraveling~~ ~~_means undoing or_~~

~~_unwinding._~~ ~~_What is Theseus unraveling?_~~


Within five minutes he was hopelessly lost. Still he went on, though he knew

that the half-man, half-bull might be waiting around the next bend for him, or

sneaking up from behind ready to eat him.


Unit 3 Stories of the Ancient Greeks
**76**


Finally, Theseus found himself at the entrance to the great central room of

the labyrinth. Resting on the stone floor at the far end was the Minotaur. It

had the huge, muscled body of a man, but instead of a man’s head, there was

the head of a bull with long, sharp horns.


Theseus broke off the golden thread and stepped forward. The Minotaur rose

to its feet to face him. Then, the Minotaur charged.


**Show Image 5A-8: Theseus and Minotaur**

**facing off**

Theseus waited as the huge beast rushed

toward him. At the last moment, the young

prince stepped to one side and **vaulted** over

the monster’s back. ~~_The word_~~ ~~vaulted~~ ~~_means_~~

~~_jumped over, using the hands to push off._~~


Confused at not having caught him on its

horns, the Minotaur turned back and charged again. Again Theseus avoided

its horns, leaping to the other side this time. Over and over, Theseus escaped

the deadly horns. Each time, Theseus was moving closer to the wall of the

room. Finally, as Theseus leaped aside once more, the Minotaur, unable to

stop, ran with an explosive shock into the wall. Staggering, it fell to its knees.

Theseus leaped upon its back and seized the great horns. He wrestled the

Minotaur to the ground and eventually defeated him. ~~_If Theseus defeated the_~~

~~_Minotaur, who won?_~~


**Show Image 5A-9: Athenians escaping the**

**maze to the ship where Ariadne is waiting**

Hours later, the other Athenians saw their

prince emerging wearily and triumphantly

from the stone tunnels. Untying the thread

that had led him back, he said quietly, “Let’s

go home.” Opening the gate, which was never

locked (for no one had ever returned), the

Athenians stole out ~~_or snuck out quietly_~~ .


The day had passed, and the city was now shadowed with night. They moved

down to the harbor and found Princess Ariadne waiting for them in the

shadows by the docks. Then they all set sail for Athens, bearing the glad

news: thanks to Theseus, the danger from the Minotaur was finally over.

**Show Image 5A-10: Triumphant Theseus**
**returning on black-sailed ship**

Theseus, however, had forgotten to change

the sails from black to white. ~~_Why was Theseus_~~

~~_supposed to change the sails? What do you_~~

~~_think King Aegeus is going to think?_~~ When his

father, King Aegeus, saw the black sails from

his perch on a cliff, he fainted and fell forward

into the sea. ~~_Why do you think King Aegeus fell forward into the sea?_~~ To this

day, the sea King Aegeus fell into is called the Aegean Sea.


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Literal. Myths often explain how something came to be. What does this
myth explain? _(how the Aegean Sea got its name)_


2. Inferential. Why does King Minos send fourteen Athenian youths into the
labyrinth every nine years? _(He sends the youths into the Labyrinth because_
_he is sad and upset over the loss of his son and blames the Athenians.)_


Check for Understanding


Who is the main character in today’s Read-Aloud? _(Theseus)_ How
can you tell he is the main character? _(Answers may vary.)_ How
is he courageous? _(He volunteers to go and stop the Minotaur,_
_from which no one has been able to escape, and then succeeds in_
_defeating it.)_


**Show Image 5A-5: Ariadne talking to Daedalus**


3. Inferential. Why does Princess Ariadne help Theseus even though she
knows her father would be furious? _(She thinks Theseus is an extraordinary_
_man.)_


4. Literal. How does Theseus defeat the Minotaur and escape from the
Labyrinth? _(Theseus ties a golden thread around the handle of the gate_
_and unwinds the rest as he goes through the maze. He then escapes the_
_Minotaur’s dangerous horns by vaulting over the beast every time he_
_approaches._ _After he defeats the Minotaur, he follows the unraveled string_
_back to the entrance of the labyrinth.)_



Unit 3 Stories of the Ancient Greeks
**78**


5. Inferential. Why is Daedalus important in this story? _(He created the_
_labyrinth and he tells Ariadne how Theseus can find his way out.)_


6. Evaluative. _Question? Pair-Share:_ Asking questions after a Read-Aloud is
one way to see how much everyone has learned. Think of a question you have
about the Read-Aloud that starts with the word _who_ or _why_ . For example, you
could ask, “Who defeats the Minotaur?” or “Why did Theseus volunteer to
enter the labyrinth?” Turn to your neighbor and ask your question. Listen to
your neighbor’s response. Then your neighbor will ask a new question, and
you will get a chance to respond. I will call on several of you to share your
questions with the class.


~~**WORD WORK: UNRAVELING (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Tying the thread to the door handle, unraveling
it with each step, Theseus set off into the labyrinth.”


2. Say the word _unraveling_ with me.


3. The prefix _un–_ means “not.” If something is unraveling, it is unwinding or
coming apart.


4. The threads in the old, worn blanket began unraveling after it was washed
many, many times.


5. Have you ever had some item that was unraveling? Try to use the word
_unraveling_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses: “Once I had a that
started unraveling.”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use an Antonyms activity for follow-up.** Antonyms are words that are the
opposite of another word. What are some antonyms, or opposites, of the
word _unraveling_ ? _(Answers may vary, but may include words such as_ tying _,_
repairing _,_ fixing _,_ wrapping _, etc.)_ ~~**TEKS 2.3.C; TEKS 2.3.D**~~


**TEKS 2.3.C** Identify the meaning of and use words with affixes un-, re-, -ly, -er, and -est (comparative and superlative), and

This is the story of a very brilliant man,

a genius, whose name was Daedalus

[/ded* ə *l ə s/]. He was able to look at a

problem and think about it until he figured out

the answer. Once, however, Daedalus faced a

challenge he wished he did not have to solve.

~~_What was his challenge?_~~ ~~(to build a labyrinth for King Minos)~~


King Minos of Crete was upset with Daedalus for helping the young hero

Theseus defeat the Minotaur and escape from Crete with Minos’s daughter,

Princess Ariadne. ~~_[Point to the image.] This is King Minos._~~ The king had no

**proof** ~~_or evidence_~~ that Daedalus had helped them, but he believed that

only Daedalus was smart enough to have done it, since he had also created

the labyrinth. ~~_Was the king right? Had Daedalus helped Theseus and the_~~

~~_princess?_~~ So King Minos announced, “Daedalus, you helped them escape,

so now I will lock you up in turn; and since there were two of you responsible

for their escape, one of whom was my own daughter, you shall share your

imprisonment with your son, Icarus [/ik* ə *r ə s/].”

Lesson 6 Daedalus and Icarus
**87**


**Show Image 6A-2: Prison tower**

The king was too smart to lock Daedalus in an

ordinary cell, however, for he feared the genius

might escape. He commanded, “Guards, lock

up Daedalus and Icarus in that great stone

tower that overlooks the ocean cliffs. There

is only one window at the top of the tower

and one door, which we will lock. Even if they

escape through the window, there is nothing below but sharp rocks and

raging ocean tides.” ~~_Do you think Daedalus and Icarus could ever escape from_~~

~~_a place like this? Why or why not?_~~


So the father and son were locked away. Twice a day, soldiers unlocked the

door to deliver food or take away the dishes. On one of those occasions,

Daedalus sent a message by the soldiers to King Minos: “If we must live out

our lives here, at least give us some books to read and candles by which to

read them after dark.” Minos saw no harm in that, and agreed—but he should

have known better, for Daedalus had a plan. ~~_Do you think Daedalus will try to_~~

~~_use the books and candles to escape? How might he do that?_~~


**Show Image 6A-3: Daedalus and Icarus**
**constructing wings**

He and Icarus would set breadcrumbs on the

**sill** ~~_or the horizontal piece at the bottom_~~ of the

tower’s high window to attract sea birds. Over

a period of months, the birds lost their fear

of Daedalus and his son and would allow the

two men to pick them up. The father and son

began to pluck feathers from their wings, though not so many as would hurt

the birds or keep them from flying. He and Icarus hid the feathers under their

beds, along with some wax from each candle the soldiers supplied, until after

several years Daedalus told his son, “Now we have what we need in order to

escape.” ~~_How do you think Daedalus will use the feathers and wax to escape?_~~


Daedalus began to unravel threads from the blankets in their tower room.

~~_What does unravel mean?_~~ Using the flames of the candles for heat, he

melted and shaped the wax they had saved, inserted into it the feathers they

had hidden, and tied it all with thread. Icarus’s eyes lit up. “You are making

us wings!”


Unit 3 Stories of the Ancient Greeks
**88**


Daedalus smiled. “If we cannot walk from our prison, we will fly. Come,

hold that candle closer to soften this wax so I can bend it.” ~~_Do you think_~~

~~_Daedalus’s plan will work?_~~


**Show Image 6A-4: Daedalus instructing and**

**warning Icarus**

It took several days to finish the work, until

one morning, the two sets of wings were ready.

Daedalus had studied the movements of the

birds and knew where the **currents** of air

blew near their seaside tower. ~~_Currents are_~~

~~_strong flows of air or water moving in a certain_~~

~~_direction._~~ He carefully taught Icarus what he knew, adding, “We will land at

that harbor over there, remove our wings, and sail away in one of the boats

anchored there. By the time King Minos knows we are gone, we will be far

from Crete. However, my son, follow me as I ride the winds safely down. If we

are not careful, and we fly too high, the sun’s heat could melt the wax in our

wings and plunge us down into the sea. Our friends the birds need not fear

this, but we are only borrowing their skills.”


“I understand, Father,” replied Icarus. They strapped on their wings and

waited as the sun began to rise over the sea.


**Show Image 6A-5: Daedalus and Icarus flying**

Below their tower were dangerous rocks and

crashing waves. Daedalus worried that they

might not make it. He thought over every

detail, and then told his son, “It is time to

regain our freedom. Come!” Stepping up to

the window, he drew a deep breath and leaped

outward—and his wings worked! The air lifted

him and held him. Looking back over his shoulder, he saw his son leap from

the tower.


Icarus laughed out loud at the sheer joy of flying. Lifting and dipping the

tips of his wings, he turned and swirled, delighting in the wonder of it all.

Forgotten in the moment was his father’s warning. As Daedalus glided

gracefully down toward the harbor, Icarus thought, “I wonder if I can make

this kind of curve, or that,” and he rode the winds higher and higher and

farther and farther out over the water. ~~_What do you think is going to happen?_~~

**Show Image 6A-6: Icarus falling, Daedalus**

**watching helplessly**

Daedalus looked back for him, but Icarus was

not following behind. Eyes wide with fear,

Daedalus called, “Icarus! Come down!” But the

boy shouted, “Look, father!” and continued his

tricks in the air, until all of a sudden, he saw a

feather loosen and drop from one of his wings.

He realized that he had flown too high. The growing heat from the morning

sun was melting the wax.


**Desperately**, ~~_or wildly with a sense of panic and need_~~ Icarus tried to turn

and follow his father’s path, but the warming air currents carried him higher.

The feathers began dropping from his wings, first one at a time, and then in

clumps. “Father! Help!” But Daedalus could not turn and rise fast enough to

help. He could only watch. Too many feathers had fallen out, and the wings

could no longer support Icarus. He **plummeted** ~~_or fell straight_~~ down, down,

down into the sea. Daedalus, weeping, reached the harbor, took a boat, and

sailed off to safety.

cruel because he imprisoned Daedalus and Icarus or they might write that
Daedalus is clever because he figured out how to escape from the tower.


Check for Understanding


**Share Your Work:** Ask at least three students to share their
journal entries on King Minos or Daedalus.


~~**WORD WORK: PROOF (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “The king had no proof that Daedalus had
helped [Theseus defeat the Minotaur and escape from the Labyrinth].”


2. Say the word _proof_ with me.


3. Proof is evidence that something is true.


4. The muddy paw prints on the carpet were proof that Cindy’s cat had been
outside in the mud.


5. Can you think of a time when you have found proof of something? Try to
use the word _proof_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If
necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses: “I found proof of

when . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?

**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I am going to read several
sentences. If the person in the sentence has proof that something happened,
say, “He or she has proof.” If the person in the sentence believes that
something happened but does not have any evidence, or proof, say, “He or

                        - Jan thought Carl was sneaking cookies before dinner, but she knew for
sure when she saw him do it. ( _She has proof._ )

##### Application


**Language:** Students will use adjectives to describe images.


~~**TEKS 2.11.C; TEKS 2.11.D.iv**~~


**Writing:** Students will summarize a Greek myth in their journals.


~~**TEKS 2.7.B; TEKS 2.7.D**~~


~~**SYNTACTIC AWARENESS ACTIVITY (10 MIN.)**~~


**Adjectives**


**Note:** Allow for variations in sentences and restate students’ sentences so
that they are grammatically correct.


  - Explain to students what an adjective is and the difference between an
adjective and a noun.


    - We know that a noun is a person, place, or thing. Today we will practice
using adjectives, which are words that are used to describe nouns.


**Show Image 6A-1: King Minos ordering Daedalus imprisoned**
Flip Book 6A-1

    - What do you see in this image? _(King Minos_ ) King Minos is a person. What
words could we use to describe how King Minos looks in this image?
_(angry, old, upset, mad, mean, etc.)_


    - The words that describe King Minos are called adjectives. Adjectives are
words that describe nouns, so they describe a person, place, or thing.


    - In the Read-Aloud you heard “This is the story of a very brilliant man . . .”


    - Who is this sentence about? _(a man, Daedalus)_ What word does the story
use to describe the man in this sentence? _(brilliant)_


    - _Brilliant_ is the adjective that is used to describe the noun _man._


  - Gather familiar classroom objects and have students help you describe them.


    - We can use adjectives to describe objects in the classroom, too. What is
the name of the object I am holding? What words, or adjectives, could we
use to describe it?


**TEKS 2.11.C** Revise drafts by adding, deleting, or rearranging words, phrases, or sentences; **[TEKS 2.11.D.iv](https://2.11.D.iv)** Edit drafts
using standard English conventions, including adjectives, including articles; **TEKS 2.7.B** Write brief comments on literary
or informational texts that demonstrate an understanding of the text; **TEKS 2.7.D** Retell and paraphrase texts in ways that

  - Have students work in partners. Give each pair familiar classroom objects to
describe to each other and give students the following directions:


    - First, identify the name of the object (pencil, marker, pen, eraser, etc.).


    - Then, describe the size, color, texture, etc. of the object to your partner.
Use as many different adjectives as you can. You can even use more than
one adjective to describe an object in a sentence. For example you might
say, “This is a long, purple, sparkly pencil.”

**Think of a Word:** As students transition to the next activity, call
on them one by one to provide an adjective describing an object
in the classroom.


~~**GREEK MYTHS JOURNAL (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that they will be continuing their journals to help them remember
important information they learn in this unit about Greek myths.


  - Tell students they will summarize or retell the main events in the story
“Daedalus and Icarus,” using the images on Activity Page 6.2 to help
them remember the story. Tell students to write at least three sentences
describing what happened in the story.


  - You may want to have students orally retell the story before they begin writing.


  - Encourage students to use at least three adjectives in their summary.


  - Encourage students to use temporal words in their writing to sequence
events. (e.g., _first, next, then, last, finally_ )


  - Collect Activity Pages 6.1 and 6.2 to ensure students have recorded
information about a character and have summarized the story of “Daedalus

~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


You should pause here and spend two days reviewing, reinforcing, or
extending the material taught thus far.


You may have students do any combination of the activities listed in this
section, but it is highly recommended you use the Mid-Unit Assessment to
assess students’ knowledge of Greek myths. The other activities may be
done in any order. You may also choose to do an activity with the whole class
or with a small group of students who would benefit from the particular
activity.


~~**CORE CONTENT OBJECTIVES UP TO THIS PAUSING POINT**~~


Students will:


  - Explain that the ancient Greeks believed in many mythical gods and
goddesses.


  - Explain that the mythical gods and goddesses of ancient Greece were
believed to have supernatural powers, unlike humans.


  - Identify the mythical Greek gods and goddesses in the Read-Alouds.


  - Identify Mount Olympus as the place believed by the ancient Greeks to be
the home of the mythical gods.


  - Identify Greek myths as a type of fiction.


  - Demonstrate familiarity with particular Greek myths.


  - Identify the elements of character, setting, plot, and supernatural beings and
events in particular Greek myths.


  - Identify common characteristics of Greek myths (i.e., they try to explain
mysteries of nature and humankind, include supernatural beings or events,
give insight into the ancient Greek culture).


  - Describe some of the many different types of mythical creatures and
characters in Greek myths, such as Cerberus and the Minotaur.

**Sequencing the Read-Aloud**


Activity Page PP.1 Materials: Activity Page PP.1; blank sheet of paper per student; scissors;
glue or tape


As a review, use the Flip Book to retell the myth “Demeter and Persephone.” Talk
about the beginning, middle, and end of the plot.


                 - Have students turn to Activity Page PP.1. Ask students to cut out the five
images, arrange them in the proper order, and then glue or tape them on the
blank sheet of paper in the order in which they occurred in the story.


                 - Beside or under each image, tell students to write a sentence describing
what is happening in the story.


~~**ACTIVITIES**~~


**Sayings and Phrases: Cold Feet**

                 - Ask students if they have ever heard the saying “cold feet.” Have students
repeat the saying. Tell students that “cold feet” is an idiom, and they will
come across more of these in the future.


                  - Explain that if someone has cold feet, he or she is afraid to do something.


                - Remind them that in the Read-Aloud, Daedalus made wings to help him and
his son Icarus escape from their prison tower. Share that right before they
jumped from the window of the tower, Daedalus saw the dangerous rocks
and crashing waves below them. The Read-Aloud said, “Daedalus worried
that they might not make it.”


                 - Tell students that we can say Daedalus had cold feet because he became afraid
at the last minute that his wings wouldn’t work, afraid for himself and his son.
Even though Daedalus had cold feet, he was able to overcome his sudden fear.


                 - Ask students if they have ever been afraid to do something. Ask: “Have you
ever had cold feet?” Give students the opportunity to share their experiences
and encourage them to use the saying.


Flip Book **Image Review**


Materials: Flip Book images, Posters of Mythological Characters

                - Show the Flip Book images from any Read-Aloud again, and have students
retell the Read-Aloud using the images.


                 - You may also wish to use the Posters of Mythological Characters to have
students review the mythical Greek gods they have heard about thus far and
what role they played in the myths.


Unit 3 Stories of the Ancient Greeks

    - I am the mythical Greek goddess of handicrafts, and I turned Arachne into
the world’s first spider. Who am I? _(Athena)_


    - The ancient Greeks believed that I created humans and stole fire for them
from the sacred hearth on Mount Olympus. Who am I? _(Prometheus)_


    - I am the mythical Greek goddess of the harvest and farming. When
Hades kidnapped my daughter, I became very sad, causing the change in
seasons. Who am I? _(Demeter)_


    - I am a master inventor and a brilliant man. King Minos locked my son and
me in a tower. Who am I? _(Daedalus)_


    - I am the prince who defeated the Minotaur in the labyrinth and saved the

about Mount Olympus to help them remember what they have learned about
it in this unit.


  - Have the students brainstorm important information about Mount Olympus:
who the ancient Greeks believed lived there, what it might look like, etc.


  - Have each student then draw a picture of what they imagine Mount Olympus
to look like, and ask him or her to write a caption for the picture.


  - Bind the pages to make a book to put in the class library for students to read
again and again.

**Character, Setting, Plot**


Materials: Drawing paper, drawing tools


**Note:** The purpose of this activity is to review characters, setting, and plot; not
to create a polished writing piece.


                 - Divide students into groups of three.


                 - Tell them that you are going to name a character and that, in their groups,
one person should draw or write the name of another character from the
same myth and pass the paper and pencil to the second student.


                 - The second student should draw or write the name of a setting from that
myth and pass the paper and pencil to the third student.


                 - The third student should write one sentence or key phrase about the plot of
the myth and raise their hand once they are finished.


                - Give each group the opportunity to orally share their drawings and/or
writing.


**Somebody Wanted But So Then**


Materials: Activity Page PP.2

Activity Page PP.2   - Explain to students that they are going to retell the stories of Prometheus
and Pandora, first individually, and then together as a class. Divide the class
in half; one half will complete a chart for Prometheus, and the other will
complete a chart for Pandora using Activity Page PP.2, a Somebody Wanted
But So Then graphic organizer.


                  - Have students work in pairs to orally fill in the chart together while one
person acts as the scribe.


                 - If time allows, have students share their charts with the class.


                - As they recount the myths, you may wish to refer back to the Flip Book
images for this Read-Aloud. As students retell the Read-Aloud, make sure
to use complete sentences and unit-related vocabulary to expand upon
their responses.

**A New Ending**

 - Show students Flip Book Image 5A-10 and ask them to share what happens
at the end of the myth “Theseus and the Minotaur.” If students have difficulty
remembering, remind them that Theseus forgets to change the sails of his
boat from black to white, and so King Aegeus thinks Theseus did not defeat
the Minotaur. King Aegeus is so shocked that he faints and falls into the sea.


 - Tell students that they are going to make up a new ending to this myth. Ask
students what they would change about the ending of this myth.

mythical god of wisdom and truth.


  - Discuss what a hero is and who the heroes are in previous myths you
have read.


    - What is a hero? _(a courageous person who is admired for doing amazing or_
_outstanding things)_


    - Share with students that a female hero is called a _heroine._


    - Have we heard about any heroes or heroines in the myths so far? Who are
they and what makes them heroes? _(Student responses will vary; ensure_
_that students provide justification for why the character is a hero or heroine.)_


  - Remind students that Theseus is a hero in “Theseus and the Minotaur”
because he defeats the Minotaur and finds his way out of the labyrinth. He is
a hero to the Athenians because they no longer have to send fourteen people
into the labyrinth every nine years.

Lesson 7 Hercules
**105**


As a baby, he once subdued, ~~_or calmed,_~~ two snakes that someone put in his

crib, such was his strength. He could carve a new channel ~~_or groove_~~ in the

ground to change the direction of a river or wrestle and defeat fierce beasts

or monsters to save people in trouble. ~~_Does it sound like Hercules used his_~~

~~_strength to help people or to hurt people? Do his actions sound heroic? Why_~~

~~_do you think people now fear him?_~~


There was only one thing Hercules could not defeat: himself. That was why

everyone now feared him. You see, Hercules had a temper as powerful as his

muscles. When he became angry, he would strike out against whatever—or

whomever—had angered him. Then he would feel terrible, thinking, “I told

myself I would not let that happen again!” But it was always too late for

whomever he had hurt.


**Show Image 7A-3: Hercules in exile**

At last the other Greeks told Hercules, “You

have done many great things for us, but now

you are a threat to our safety. You may no

longer live among us. Furthermore, anyone

sheltering you, feeding you, or even speaking





with you will also be forced out from among

us.” ~~_How would you feel if you were Hercules_~~



~~_and heard this from the Greeks you had so long protected?_~~ So Hercules, once

the most beloved and admired person in the land, was forced to wander,

friendless and alone. ~~_Do the Greeks think of Hercules as a hero now?_~~


After a while, he no longer cared about his appearance. His hair and beard

grew shaggy; his clothing became torn. If no one else cared, why should he?

Food was not a problem, for he was a great hunter, but he no longer took

pleasure in a hearty ~~_or extremely nourishing_~~ meal. He ate just to survive.


For three long years, Hercules, who had the strength and courage of a lion,

wandered **aimlessly** . ~~Aimlessly~~ ~~_means without purpose or direction. What do_~~

~~_you think it means to have the strength and courage of a lion?_~~ If he stumbled

into a place where some **dreadful** ~~_or terrible_~~ danger threatened the people,

he would take care of the problem on his own, although no one had asked

him to do so or thanked him at the end. Then he would continue on his way.

~~_Is Hercules still acting like a hero even though the Greeks don’t think of him as_~~

~~_one? Why or why not?_~~

against a tree trunk, Hercules noticed a line of

horsemen riding into sight. Their road passed

by the foot of his hill, so they came closer.

Then, to Hercules’s shock, the lead rider held

up his hand to halt ~~_or stop_~~ the others and,



turning his horse, started alone up the hill straight toward Hercules. As the

rider came closer and closer, Hercules rose to his feet in surprise and alarm.

He thought, “Doesn’t he know what will happen to him if he approaches me?”

The huge man began to wave his arms and shout, “Go back! Go back!” Still,

the horseman rode straight toward him.


Now Hercules could see the rider’s face, and his concern became even

greater, for the horseman was another great Grecian hero, Theseus, king of

Athens. ~~_What have you already heard about Theseus? Is Theseus a hero?_~~ The

two men had become loyal friends ever since Hercules had rescued Theseus

from the underworld. ~~_But that’s a story for another time._~~ Now, as Theseus

continued toward him, Hercules again shouted, “Go back!”


**Show Image 7A-5: Theseus inviting Hercules**

**to Athens**

But Theseus rode straight up to Hercules,

dismounted, and then took Hercules’s huge

hand between his own. “I have been looking

for you, my friend,” Theseus said, and despite





everything, in that moment Hercules felt a

faint ray of hope. Theseus went on, “I know you



did not do those dreadful things on purpose. ~~_What does the word_~~ ~~dreadful~~

~~_mean?_~~ Come with me to Athens, where the people care more for true justice.”


By helping Hercules, Theseus was risking his crown ~~_or his position as king_~~

and his entire way of life. ~~_Is Theseus still acting as a hero in this story? Why or_~~

~~_why not?_~~ Fortunately, the Athenians so completely trusted his wisdom and

honor that they then welcomed Hercules among them. Still, the huge man

felt sad for what he had done. Theseus told him, “You will never be free of the

past until you have worked away your guilt and mastered your temper and

your great strength. Go ask Apollo, the god of wisdom and truth, how to do

these things. And remember always, you have a friend who believes in you.”

~~_What advice do you think Apollo will give Hercules? How do you think Hercules_~~

~~_can master his temper and strength?_~~

~~**“OTHER ADVENTURES OF HERCULES” (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 8A-1: Priestess at Delphi**

As Hercules journeyed across Greece, he

thought about what his friend Theseus had told

him: “You will never be free of the past until you

have worked away your guilt and mastered your

temper and your great strength. Go ask Apollo,





the god of wisdom and truth, how to do these

things. And remember always, you have a friend

who believes in you.”



Hercules traveled up into the mountains until he reached Delphi [/del*fie/],

where there was a famous temple built to honor the god Apollo. In a cave

behind this temple sat a priestess. When someone asked her a question, she

would go into a trance, as if she were asleep, and Apollo would speak through

her. The words would come from her mouth, with her voice, but the Greeks

believed they were really Apollo’s words.


Hercules asked for Apollo’s **guidance**, ~~_or advice,_~~ and the answer came back:

“Go to King Eurystheus [/yor*is*thee* ə s/] and do as he commands.”


Thus began perhaps the most famous of Hercules’s many adventures. King

Eurystheus sent the hero out to perform the most difficult tasks he could

think of, twelve in all, and these daring deeds became known as “The Labors

of Hercules.” ~~_A labor is a job or task. So Hercules has twelve jobs to do. Based_~~

~~_on what you know about Hercules, what do you think these labors might be?_~~


**Show Image 8A-2: King Eurystheus telling**
**Hercules of the Nemean lion**

The first of these labors that King Eurystheus

commanded Hercules to complete involved a

large and dangerous animal. King Eurystheus

was a small man, and he paced nervously back





and forth in front of his throne as he spoke to

the huge Hercules, who stood listening.



“In another part of Greece known as ‘Nemea’ [/nee*mee* ə /],” the king

began, “there lives a dangerous lion. You, Hercules, shall subdue the lion so

he won’t ever hurt anyone. I am told that the lion’s hide ~~_or skin_~~ is magical.

No material known to man, such as metal, stone, or wood, can cut that lion’s

skin. You will have to think of another way to stop it.”


Bowing, Hercules said, “I do not know how I can do this, but I will try.” ~~_Do you_~~

~~_think Hercules will be able to subdue the lion? How?_~~


However, as he left the throne room, he thought, “Perhaps this story is not

accurate. ~~_The word_~~ ~~accurate~~ ~~_means without mistake._~~ Perhaps the hunters

simply have not gotten close enough to shoot their arrows at the lion, but I

will bring my own bow and arrows, as well as my heavy stone club.”


**Show Image 8A-3: Hercules taking aim at**
**the lion**

Hercules journeyed to Nemea, and, at last,

found the fierce animal out in the forest,

sleeping in the midday heat. Hercules moved

forward until he had a clear view of the beast.

Then the hero drew an arrow from his quiver

and set the end to the string of his



bow. Drawing back the string, he took careful aim, and then let go, but the

arrow simply bounced right off the lion! Its hide was indeed magical.


The lion was unhurt, but it still felt the blow. It awoke and leapt to its feet,

roaring with rage, and then charged Hercules. Throwing down his bow and

arrows, the hero stood waiting, his heavy stone club in his hand.


Lesson 8 Other Adventures of Hercules
**117**


**Show Image 8A-4: Hercules breaking his club**
**over the lion**

When the lion leaped at him, Hercules simply

stepped to the side and let the lion sail right

past him. Then Hercules struck with his club,

which would have been powerful enough to

knock down an elephant, but the Nemean lion,

protected by its magical hide, did not



suffer terribly from the impact. ~~_So was that a strong blow?_~~ It only sank to

the ground for a moment, stunned. The club, however, had shattered into a

hundred pieces.


**Show Image 8A-5: Hercules wrestling the lion**

Knowing that in a moment the large cat would

leap to the attack again, Hercules turned and

leaped upon the lion’s back. Then Hercules

reached forward and grabbed the lion’s front

paws so that it could not turn them against





Hercules. The furious beast rolled on its back

on the ground and tried to shake him off.



But Hercules’s strength was too much, and he was able to subdue the lion.


**Show Image 8A-6: Hercules making his lion-**
**skin outfit**

Catching his breath, Hercules thought, “The

report was true. The lion’s hide protected it

from my club and my arrows. If I could wear it,

it would provide me protection against swords





and arrows. How can I possibly do this?”


After trying many ways to get the hide off the



lion, Hercules had a brilliant idea: he lifted one of the lion’s paws from the

ground and used the lion’s own claws to cut the hide.


So that is how Hercules slew the Nemean lion and succeeded in completing

the first of his twelve labors for King Eurystheus. ~~_What do you think some of_~~

~~_Hercules’s other labors might be?_~~


Unit 3 Stories of the Ancient Greeks
**118**


**Show Image 8A-7: King Eurystheus telling of**
**the golden apples**

King Eurystheus smiled at the large man in

the lion skin who stood before his throne.

“Hercules,” said the king, “I have another labor

for you to attempt, or try. ~~_What is a labor?_~~ I

want you to bring me three of the golden apples

of the Hesperides [/hes*paer* ə *deez/].”



This startled even Hercules.“But,Your Majesty, those apples are carefully guarded by

three magical sisters who live beyond any land to which humans have ever traveled.

According to stories, in the middle of their garden is a tree from which there grow

apples of real gold. The sisters keep the location secret, for otherwise people would

constantly trample or stomp all over the place just to get the gold. How am I to bring

you these apples if no one even knows where they are or if they even exist?”


The king shrugged. “If it were easy, Hercules, I would not need you. Now go.”

~~_Does this labor seem more difficult than Hercules’s first? Do you think he will_~~

~~_need to use his muscles or his brain more for this task?_~~


**Show Image 8A-8: Ship setting sail**

So Hercules, who had traveled throughout the

known world, now set sail for the unknown

world. He sailed west and after searching in

vain ~~_or without seeing any results_~~ for several

weeks, he thought, “There must be a better





way to find the Hesperides.” Suddenly he

grinned. “Wait a moment! I cannot find



them myself, but I know where to find someone who might be able to help.”


**Show Image 8A-9: Atlas holding up the sky**

You see, the Hesperides were the daughters

of the biggest and strongest of all the Titans,

Atlas. The Titans used to rule the world before

Zeus became king of the gods. After Zeus

became king, he punished Atlas for fighting





against him by having him stand and hold the

entire sky on his massive shoulders



so that it would not fall down upon the earth. ~~_This is how the ancient Greeks_~~

~~_explained how and why the sky, the stars, and the moon remained above_~~

~~_them. Is there really a person who holds up the sky?_~~


Lesson 8 Other Adventures of Hercules
**119**


Hercules journeyed until he found a range of enormous mountains. In the

middle of them stood Atlas bent beneath the weight of the sky. Hercules

shouted, “Hello, Atlas!”


Atlas squinted downward, calling in a deep voice, “Who is there?”


“It is I, Hercules. I have come to ask a favor.” Then Hercules explained his

mission to clear his **reputation** ~~_or the people’s opinion of him_~~ as a man of

bad temper, ending with his request, “I hoped you might direct me to your

daughters and their garden.”


Atlas replied, “I would gladly do so, but my daughters made me promise

never to tell anyone where it is. I cannot break a promise—not even for you,

Hercules. I would get you the apples myself, but I dare not set down the sky.”


Thinking for a moment, Hercules said, “I am nowhere near your size, Atlas,

but you know I am strong. Perhaps I can hold the sky while you go and get

the three apples I need.”


**Show Image 8A-10: Hercules holding up the**
**sky**

Atlas had stood unmoving for so long that now

even his ideas moved slowly. Finally he agreed,

warning, “Brace yourself, Hercules. Even you

have never held a weight such as this one.”





Slowly the Titan lowered himself to his knees

and transferred onto Hercules’s shoulders the



weight of the entire sky and everything in it. ~~_Do you think this will be a great_~~

~~_weight or a small weight?_~~


Even Hercules, strong as he was, staggered a bit. Then he found his balance

and said, “I have it now. Hurry back, Atlas.” The Titan strode away with mile
long steps. For a long time, Hercules stood bent beneath that **immeasurable**

load ~~_or load that is too heavy to measure_~~ .


Unit 3 Stories of the Ancient Greeks
**120**


**Show Image 8A-11: Atlas with apples**

At last Atlas returned and showed Hercules

the golden apples. But to Hercules’s horror,

Atlas told him, “I have held the sky almost

from the beginning of time, and until today I

could never set it down. Now I know someone

else is strong enough to take over the job. I will

take the apples to your king.”



~~_Do you think Atlas will come back if Hercules lets him take the apples to King_~~

~~_Eurystheus?_~~


Hercules did not like this idea at all. Knowing how slowly Atlas thought,

however, the hero answered, “I did not know I would be holding the sky for so

long a time, Atlas, so I was not careful enough when I took it from you. There

seems to be a planet rubbing against the back of my neck, and it is starting

to hurt. I am afraid I might drop the sky. Before you go, please get the blanket

from my pack over there and slip it between my neck and that planet.”


**Show Image 8A-12: Hercules tricking Atlas**

Atlas tried, but his hands were so large that he

could not get the blanket out of the pack, so

Hercules suggested, “Take back the sky long

enough for me to set the blanket in place.” He

handed the load back to the Titan. As soon as





Atlas held the sky once more, Hercules said, “I

am sorry, Atlas, but Zeus chose you to



hold the sky. Thank you for bringing me the apples.” ~~_Who is Zeus?_~~


Atlas sighed, realizing Hercules had turned his own trick back against him.

“I suppose it is only fair. Well, Hercules, come back and visit old Atlas again

sometime.” So Hercules took the apples to the king, completing another

labor, and Atlas never again set down the sky.


**Show Image 8A-13: Hercules happy again**

Hercules completed all twelve of his labors

after defeating the Nemean lion and retrieving

the golden apples. Once he did, he was free

to leave the service of King Eurystheus. He

2. Literal. What does King Eurystheus tell Hercules to do? _(He makes him_
_do the twelve most difficult tasks he can think of, also known as the Twelve_
_Labors of Hercules.)_


3. Evaluative. Why do you think Hercules obeys King Eurystheus? _(Answers_
_may vary but may include because Theseus told him he can work away his_
_guilt and master his temper and great strength if he completes the difficult_
_tasks; because Apollo told him to; etc.)_

4. Inferential. What does Hercules have to do in this story and what difficulties
does he encounter?

   - Literal. What is Hercules’s first labor? _(subduing the Nemean lion)_


   - Inferential. What makes the Nemean lion hard to subdue? _(It has a_
_magical hide that cannot be injured.)_ How does Hercules defeat the
Nemean lion? _(He uses the lion’s own claw to cut its magical hide.)_


   - Inferential. What is Hercules’s second labor? _(to bring back the golden_
_apples of the Hesperides)_ Which does Hercules have to use the most to
complete this labor: his strength or his brain? _(both)_


   - Inferential. Why is this a difficult task? _(No one has ever traveled to the_
_land of the Hesperides; the location of the apples is secret so that the place_
_isn’t trampled; no one even knows if the apples exist.)_


   - Inferential. How does Hercules get the apples? _(He convinces Atlas to get_
_the apples for him while he holds the sky for Atlas. Then he tricks Atlas into_
_taking the sky back and leaves with the apples.)_

answer came back: ‘Go to King Eurystheus and do as he commands.’”


2. Say the word _guidance_ with me.


3. If you offer someone guidance, you are giving them advice or helping them to
make a decision.


4. Without guidance at the pet store, Joshua felt like he wouldn’t be able to
decide which pet to buy.


5. Have you ever given or received guidance? Try to use the word _guidance_
when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/
or rephrase the students’ responses: “I received guidance from once
when . . .” or “I gave guidance to once when . . .”]

describing the apples:


**Show Image 8A-11**
Flip Book 8A-11

_King Eurystheus smiled at the large man in the lion skin who stood_
_before his throne. “Hercules,” said the king, “I have another labor for_
_you to attempt, or try. I want you to bring me three of the golden apples_
_of the Hesperides.”_


_This startled even Hercules. “But, Your Majesty, those apples are_
_carefully guarded by three magical sisters who live beyond any land to_
_which humans have ever traveled. According to stories, in the middle_
_of their garden is a tree from which there grow apples of real gold. The_
_sisters keep the location secret, for otherwise people would constantly_
_trample the place just to get the gold. How am I to bring you these_
_apples if no one even knows where they are or if they even exist?”_


             - Ask students the following questions about the apples to prepare them to
make inferences about how the apples play an important role in the myth you
will read today:


                   - What was special about the apples Hercules had to get for King
Eurystheus? _(they were made of gold)_


                   - Why did the sisters keep the location of the golden apples secret?

_(because otherwise people would constantly trample or stomp all over the_
_place just to get the gold)_

_may vary.)_

This king and queen had a daughter, a princess



who was intelligent, beautiful, and a **skilled** ~~_or gifted and able_~~ huntress. She

also happened to be the fastest runner in the world. Her name was Atalanta

[/at* ə *lan*t ə /].


**Show Image 9A-2: An older Atalanta talking**

When she reached a certain age, Atalanta’s

parents told her, “One day you will become

queen, and ruling this land is too big a job for

one person to do alone. It is time for you to





marry.” ~~_Why do Atalanta’s parents want her to_~~

Here _terms_ means

_Terms_ can also mean

To their surprise, Atalanta replied, “I can ask wise men or women to help me

run the country. As for a husband, perhaps I shall have one someday, but for

now, there is no one whom I wish to marry.” ~~_In the time that the story was_~~

~~_written, the daughter of a king and queen was expected to get married to_~~

~~_carry on the royal household. Because of this, Atalanta’s parents were very_~~

~~_surprised by her statement that she didn’t want to get married. However, a_~~

~~_decision to not get married today would not receive the same reaction._~~


The queen asked, “What about all those fine young men who come around

asking to marry you? Surely there must be one . . .”


“They care nothing for me, Mother,” Atalanta replied. “They only want to

marry me in order to become king one day.”


But the king and queen insisted. ~~_What does insisted mean?_~~ Finally, Princess

Atalanta said, “Very well, I shall marry the first unmarried man who can

defeat me in a foot race.”


“What?” her parents exclaimed. They tried to talk her out of the idea, but

they could not, so at last they agreed to her **terms** ~~_or conditions_~~ and sent

word throughout the land. ~~_What are Atalanta’s terms? Do you think any man_~~

~~_will be able to defeat Atalanta, the fastest runner in the world, in a race?_~~


**Show Image 9A-3: Atalanta besting her**

As you might imagine, many young men came

to race against the princess, hoping to marry

her. She easily defeated every single one,

enjoying herself **tremendously** ~~_or greatly_~~ .





**132**



One day, after winning yet another race, she

just kept running past the finish line for the

sheer delight of it. She did not know that looking down from Mount Olympus

that day was the goddess of love, Aphrodite [/af*r ə *die*tee/]. ~~_Why would_~~

~~_Aphrodite be looking down from Mount Olympus?_~~ The goddess thought, “She

is making a joke of love! I cannot allow this to go on.” ~~_Is Aphrodite upset or_~~

~~_happy about Atalanta’s behavior? What do you think Aphrodite will do?_~~


Unit 3 Stories of the Ancient Greeks


**Show Image 9A-4: Eros shooting**
**Hippomenes with an arrow**

Now at that same moment, a young man was

walking along the same road upon which

Atalanta was now running. The young man

was a brave adventurer named Hippomenes

[/hip*om* ə *neez/]. He was just returning

from a long sea voyage, ~~_or journey,_~~ so he knew



nothing of the princess’s challenge. As Hippomenes walked along, he glanced

ahead and saw the most beautiful young woman he had ever laid eyes on

running his way at an unbelievable speed. It was Atalanta, of course, and as

Hippomenes was looking at her, the goddess Aphrodite was looking at him.

Turning to her son, Eros, Aphrodite said, “Go shoot an invisible arrow of love

into Hippomenes’ heart, so that he will fall in love with Atalanta.”


So Eros did as he was told, and Hippomenes instantly fell in love with

Atalanta as she ran by him. He thought, “I have never seen such joy on a

human face! I would not have thought it possible, but I believe that I have

fallen in love with her.” At once he began to ask Aphrodite for help, which

is what the goddess had planned all along. ~~_Why does he choose to ask_~~

~~_Aphrodite out of all of the mythical gods and goddesses?_~~ She appeared

before Hippomenes and told him that he must outrace Atalanta if he wanted

to marry her.


**Show Image 9A-5: Aphrodite advising**
**Hippomenes**

“But this is impossible, my lady,” Hippomenes

told Aphrodite. “I am a very fast runner, but

I have never seen anyone move as Atalanta

does.”





Aphrodite presented Hippomenes with three

apples made of purest gold that shone almost

as brightly as the sun. “When Atalanta sees these apples, she will not be able to

**resist** picking them up,” Aphrodite said. ~~_Would you be able to resist, or to stop_~~

~~_yourself, from picking up golden apples such as these?_~~ “Here is what you must do.”


Lesson 9 Atalanta and the Golden Apples



**133**


**Show Image 9A-6: Atalanta and Hippomenes**
**at starting line**

The next day, Hippomenes challenged Atalanta

to a race. Inside his rather loose-fitting

clothing, he had hidden the three golden

apples. Before the race, he told Atalanta, “Your

Highness, I want you to know why I am racing

against you.”



Atalanta answered, “In order to marry a princess and become king someday.”

~~_Is Atalanta correct?_~~


To her shock he replied, “No, in order to marry the woman I love. She just

happens to be a princess.” Then he walked to the starting line while Atalanta

thought, “There is something different about this one.” Still, she took her

place next to him. A moment later the race was on!


**Show Image 9A-7: Atalanta chasing a golden**
**apple**

Atalanta began to pull ahead almost at once,

but Hippomenes drew one of the apples from

inside his clothing and tossed it ahead of

her and a little off to the side. The moment





Atalanta saw the apple, she had to have it.

~~_What do you think will happen?_~~ She turned



and went after it. As she picked it up, she saw Hippomenes ahead of her, and

losing no more time, she took off like a deer.


Soon Hippomenes heard her footsteps closing in behind him. Drawing

out apple number two, he held it up so she would see it and tossed it back

over his shoulder. She turned right around and ran back to get it while

Hippomenes ran on. Grabbing the second apple, she saw Hippomenes

halfway to the finish line. This time Atalanta took off after him like a speeding

cheetah dashing across the grasslands.


**Show Image 9A-8: Atalanta chasing after the**
**third apple**

Soon Hippomenes could hear her rapid

footsteps getting closer, and he took out apple

number three and threw it into a nearby field

of tall grass. Of course, Atalanta went after it,





hunting through the grass for the golden fruit

while Hippomenes kept running. This one, too, she held in the palm of her

hand as she returned to the race.


**Show Image 9A-9: Atalanta and Hippomenes**
**speeding across the finish line**

In all of Atalanta’s life, she had never run as

she ran then. Her feet seemed not to touch

the ground. Faster and faster she moved, and

closer and closer to Hippomenes she came.





He told himself, “Don’t look back or you might

lose a step.”



Now she was only three steps behind him; now two steps; now just one; and

then, she thought to herself, “Would it be so terrible if I did marry him?” And

as she thought that, Hippomenes gained a step and crossed the finish line

before her.

6. Literal. At the end of the myth, is Atalanta tremendously happy or sad that
she married Hippomenes? _(She is tremendously happy.)_


Exit Pass


Tell students to do the following on a piece of paper:


      - Draw a picture depicting a scene from “Atalanta and the Golden
Apples.”


      - Label the characters in the picture.


      - Write a sentence describing how the characters reacted to the
event depicted in the scene.


For example, students might draw Hippomenes throwing apples
for Atalanta to pick up during the race. Below, the student
would write “Atalanta was distracted by the golden apples
Hippomenes threw.”


Unit 3 Stories of the Ancient Greeks


~~**WORD WORK: RESIST (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “When Atalanta sees these apples, she will not
be able to resist picking them up.”


2. Say the word _resist_ with me.


3. If you resist something, you turn it down or say no to it.


4. Daniel had to resist staying up too late to read his comic book because he
needed to be rested for his test in the morning.


5. Have you ever had to resist something? Try to use the word _resist_ when you
tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase
the students’ responses: “I had to resist once when . . .” or “I could not
resist because . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use an Antonyms activity for follow-up.** Antonyms are words that are the
opposite of another word. What are some antonyms, or opposites, of resist?
(Answers may vary, but may include _allow, obey, agree, accept,_ etc.)

~~**EDIT A GREEK MYTH (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that they have planned and drafted their myths.


  - Tell students that revising and editing are next in the writing process.


  - Tell students they are going to revise and edit the myths they wrote on Activity Page

8.1. Explain that this means they are going to read the story to make sure they have
said everything they wanted to or needed to say and to check for any mistakes.


  - Give students Activity Page 9.1 to use as a checklist to edit their fictional
narratives. Display a copy of the Editing Checklist: Greek Myth from the
Digital Components. Review what each item on the checklist represents.
Students should be familiar with this checklist after using a similar one in
Unit 2: _Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government._









|Item from Student Checklist|What It Means|
|---|---|
|~~. ? !~~<br>|punctuation at the end of each sentence|
|<br>~~T~~he cat ran.|capital letter at the beginning of each<br>sentence|

**TEKS 2.11.C** Revise drafts by adding, deleting, or rearranging words, phrases, or sentences; **TEKS 2.11.D** Edit drafts using
standard English conventions, including (vi) prepositions and prepositional phrases; (vii) pronouns, including subjective,
objective, and possessive cases; **TEKS 2.12.A** Compose literary texts, including personal narratives and poetry.


Unit 3 Stories of the Ancient Greeks


Check for Understanding


According to the editing checklist, what are you going to look
for in your stories? _(punctuation; capitalization; character with a_
_name; beginning, middle, and end; prepositions; and pronouns)_


- Tell students to read their stories, checking for each item on the list. If

students find something they want to add to or edit in their stories, have
them mark it in a different color/type of writing utensil in their stories.


- Remind students they can reference Activity Page 7.2 with their original plans
to help them add to and edit their stories.


- Tell students when checking for prepositions and pronouns to look for places
to add prepositions and prepositional phrases and for correct use of pronoun
cases. Consider modeling editing a sample myth for prepositions and
pronouns according to the following information.


- Explain to students that a preposition is a word that can help tell where something
is taking place. Words like _in, out, under, above,_ etc., are called _prepositions._
Prepositions are useful in making simple sentences longer and more interesting.


- Remind students that a prepositional phrase is a phrase that begins with
a preposition and is followed by an object (e.g., _in the cave, on the table,_
_under the rock, above the clouds_ ). A prepositional phrase answers the same
question, _where,_ that a preposition answers about something in a sentence.


- To reinforce how to edit drafts for pronoun cases (subjective, objective, and
possessive), explain the differences between them and provide examples:



Challenge


Have students work with
a partner to share, add
to, and edit their myths.
Allow students to share
any mistakes they see,
what they like about
what has been written,
and what changes they
may suggest.

the home of the mythical gods.


  - Identify Greek myths as a type of fiction.


  - Demonstrate familiarity with particular Greek myths.


  - Identify the elements of character, setting, plot, and supernatural beings and
events in particular Greek myths.


  - Identify common characteristics of Greek myths (i.e., they try to explain

Unit 3 Stories of the Ancient Greeks


~~**REVIEW ACTIVITIES**~~


**Greek Myths Journal**


Materials: paper and writing tools

  - Encourage students to write additional entries for their Greek Myths Journal.


**Image Review**
Flip Book

Materials: Greek Myths Chart

  - Show the Flip Book images from any Read-Aloud again, and have students
retell the Read-Aloud using the images.


  - Additionally, you may wish to use these images to review the Greek Myths
Chart you created throughout the lessons.


**Mythological Characters Review**


Materials: Posters of Mythological Characters

  - Use the Posters of Mythological Characters to review with students the
twelve main mythical gods/goddesses of Mount Olympus, or the twelve
Olympians. Have students describe what each mythical Greek god/goddess
was believed to be in charge of and what the ancient Greeks believed it
meant to be a mythical god/goddess of something.


**Image Card Review**
Image Cards 3–9

Materials: Image Cards 3–9

  - In your hand, hold Image Cards 3–9 fanned out like a deck of cards. Ask a
student to choose a card but to not show it to anyone else in the class.


  - The student must then perform an action or give a clue about the picture

he or she is holding. For example, for Hercules, a student may pretend
to be wrestling with a lion. The rest of the class will guess the character
being described.


  - Proceed to another card when the correct answer has been given.


**Riddles for Core Content**

  - Ask the students riddles such as the following to review core content:


    - I am a very strong man who has to seek help from Apollo to learn how to
control my own temper. Who am I? _(Hercules)_

##### Culminating Activities


~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


Please use this final day to address class results of the Unit Assessment. Based on
the results of the Formative and Unit Assessments, you may wish to use this class
time to provide remediation opportunities that target specific areas of weakness for
individual students, small groups, or the whole class.


Alternatively, you may also choose to use this class time to extend or enrich
students’ experience with unit knowledge. A number of enrichment activities are
provided in this section in order to provide students with opportunities to enliven
their experiences with unit concepts.


~~**REMEDIATION**~~


You may choose to regroup students according to particular areas of
weakness, as indicated by Formative and Unit Assessment results.


Remediation opportunities include:


  - targeting Review Activities


  - revisiting lesson Applications


  - rereading and discussing select Read-Alouds


~~**ENRICHMENT**~~


**Publish a Greek Myth (10 min.)**

  - Tell students that they will now publish their myths. Remind students of the
three steps of the writing process you already completed.


    - You planned your stories using a graphic organizer to specify the
characters, settings, and plot.


    - You drafted your stories by writing the information from the graphic
organizer onto a piece of paper in paragraph format, forming complete
sentences, and adding a title.


    - Then, you edited your drafts by going through an editing checklist and
making changes to make your drafts better.


    - Today you will publish your myths.


Unit 3 Stories of the Ancient Greeks


  - Tell students to copy their edited drafts onto a clean piece of paper or have
students publish their edited drafts on a computer.


  - You may have students add illustrations to their story.


**Note:** If you are grading the final versions of their myths, use a rubric with
the following story elements: title, setting, Greek characters, plot (beginning
middle, and ending), and lesson. Include writing format (paragraphs) and
sentence structure (capitalization and punctuation) in your grading. Share
strengths and areas of improving their writing, too.


**Sharing a Greek Myth**

  - If some students have not yet had the opportunity, allow them to share their
Greek myths with the class.


**Student Choice**

  - Have students select a Read-Aloud to be heard again.


**Create a Myth or Mythical Character**

  - Have students create their own mythical character and describe its abilities.


  - Have students make up their own story about a mythical character, such as
Hercules or the minotaur.


  - Review with students what types of mythical characters existed in Greek
mythology using the Posters of Mythological Characters and Image Cards
7–9.


  - Have students decide if their character will be human or nonhuman. Have
them decide if the character will have supernatural powers.


  - Have them draw their mythical character and write one or two sentences to
tell about it.


  - As students share their characters with the class, remember to repeat and
expand upon their vocabulary using richer and more complex language,
including, if possible, any Read-Aloud vocabulary.


**Character, Setting, Plot**


Materials: Drawing paper, drawing tools


**Note:** The purpose of this activity is to review characters, setting, and plot;
not to create a polished writing piece.


  - Divide students into groups of three.


  - Tell them that you are going to name a character, and that in their groups
one person should draw or write the name of another character from the
same myth and pass the paper and pencil to the second student. The second


Culminating Activities
**147**


**148**



student should draw or write the name of a setting from that myth and pass
the paper and pencil to the third student. The third student should write one
sentence or key phrase about the plot of the myth and raise their hand once
they are finished.


 - Give each group the opportunity to orally share their drawings and/or writing.


**Fun with Riddles**

 - After reading a few of these riddles and allowing students to guess the
answers, have students work in groups to write their own riddles about the
Greek myths they have heard. They may also wish to share riddles that they
already know.


   - What has been around for millions of years but is never more than a month
old? _(the moon)_


   - What goes up but never comes down? _(your age)_


   - What occurs once in a minute, twice in a moment, and never in a thousand

myth and retell the myth using the puppets.


**Writing Prompts**


Students may be given an additional writing prompt such as the following:


 - One Greek myth I have heard that is my favorite is . . .


 - One thing I like to do as much as Atalanta likes to run is . . .


 - If you only get to read one Greek myth, you must read . . .
