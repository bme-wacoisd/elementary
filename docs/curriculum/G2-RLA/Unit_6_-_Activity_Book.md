Dear Family Member,


#### 1.1 Take-Home



Over the next few days, your student will be learning about the largest group of animals
on Earth, insects. Below are some suggestions for activities you can do at home to
reinforce your student’s learning about insects.


1. Insect Hunt


Talk about where you may find insects at home and on outings together. Look for them
together; it may be fun to go out after dark with a flashlight when some insects come out
to feed. Use a field guide or the Internet to identify the insects you observe.


2. Examining Insects Closely


If possible, find informational videos about insects. Watch them with your student and
discover interesting facts about insects together.


3. Words to Use


Below is a list of some words that your student will be using at school. Try to use these
words as they come up in everyday speech with your student.

     - _social_ —Olivia’s birthday party was the biggest social event of the week.

     - _solitary_ —Reading to oneself is a fun way to spend solitary time.

     - _cooperate_ —Please cooperate by helping to fold the laundry before we go for a
walk.

    - _microscopic_ —The germs that cause a virus like the common cold are microscopic.


4. Draw an Insect Colony


Have your student draw a picture of an ant or bee colony and then tell you about it.
Ask your student to identify the different members of the colony and tell you how they
cooperate through performing different roles.


Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read to your student each day. The local library has many
books on insects.

Dear Family Member,


#### 5.2 Take-Home



I hope your student is enjoying learning about the fascinating world of insects. Over the
next few days they will learn more about how insects communicate with one another, as
well as ways in which insects are both helpful and harmful to our planet. Below are some
suggestions for activities that you can do at home to reinforce your student’s learning
about insects.


1. What’s a Bug?


Your student will learn that “all bugs are insects, but not all insects are bugs.” Ask them
to explain why. Then, try to use the word _insect_ instead of _bug_ when talking to your student
about common household creepy-crawlers.


2. Examining Insects Closely


If possible, search for or rent videos/DVDs about insects. Watch them with your
student and discover interesting facts together. You may be able to find videos at your
local library.


3. Words to Use


Below is a list of some of the words that your student will be using at school. Try to use
these words as they come up in everyday speech with your student.

     - _communicate—_ Honeybees do a waggle dance to communicate with each other.

     - _destructive_ —Some hurricanes can be very destructive.

     - _entomologist_ —An entomologist is a person who studies insects.


4. Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read to your student each day.
