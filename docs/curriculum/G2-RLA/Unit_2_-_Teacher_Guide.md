##### Introduction


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching _Ancient_
_Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government_ unit. The Teacher Guide for _Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition,_
_and Government_ contains twelve daily lessons, each of which is composed of two distinct parts,
so that the lesson may be divided into smaller chunks of time and presented at different intervals
during the day. Each entire lesson will require a total of sixty minutes.


This unit includes a two-day Pausing Point following Lesson 7. At the end of the unit, a Unit Review, a
Unit Assessment, and Culminating Activities are included to allow time to review, reinforce, assess,
and remediate content knowledge. You should spend no more than seventeen days total on this unit.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


At the back of this Teacher Guide, you will find a section titled “Teacher Resources.” In this section
you will find the following:


  - Ancient Greek Civilization Chart


  - Activity Book Answer Key


  - Measures of Text Complexity


  - Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Correlation Chart


  - English Language Proficiency Standards Correlation Chart


~~**INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS**~~


Along with this Teacher Guide, you will need:


  - Flip Book for _Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government_


  - Activity Book for _Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government_


  - Image Cards for _Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government_


  - Digital Components for _Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government_


All unit components’ materials can also be found in the digital version provided with the online materials.


Introduction
**1**


~~**ADDITIONAL RESOURCES**~~


You should consider various times throughout the day when you might infuse the curriculum with
authentic unit-related literature. You might also consider creating a classroom lending library,
allowing students to borrow unit-related books to read at home with their families.


~~**WHY ANCIENT GREEKS: LIFE, TRADITION, AND GOVERNMENT IS IMPORTANT**~~


This unit will introduce students to an ancient civilization whose contributions can be seen in many
areas of our lives today. Students will learn about the mythical gods and goddesses of the ancient
Greeks, the city-states of Sparta and Athens, and the philosophers Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.
They will learn about the first Olympic Games held in honor of Zeus, the significance of the battles
of Marathon and Thermopylae, and the conquests of Alexander the Great. Students will also learn
about the Greek contribution of democracy and how its ideals are used today in many governments,
including our own. This unit will lay the foundation for review and further study of ancient Greece in
later grades and help students better understand world history and American history in later years.


The text that students will be reading and discussing in this unit also provides opportunities for
students to build content knowledge and draw connections to social studies. You may build on
class discussions to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of
Geography, Government, and Social Studies Skills from the Social Studies TEKS. This content is
not a replacement for grade-level social studies instruction. For more information on using religious
source material in reading/language arts, consult the program guide. For more information about
the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the
Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED**~~


The following units are particularly relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _Ancient_
_Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government._ This background knowledge will greatly enhance students’
understanding of the Read-Alouds they are about to enjoy:


      - **Kings and Queens (Kindergarten)**


      - **Early American Civilizations: Aztecs, Maya, Incas (Grade 1)**


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government
**2**


~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR ANCIENT GREEKS: LIFE, TRADITION, AND GOVERNMENT**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and_
_Government_ in the forms in which they appear in the Read-Alouds or, in some instances, in the
“Introducing the Read-Aloud” section at the beginning of the lesson. Boldfaced words in the list
have an associated Word Work activity. The inclusion of the words on this list does not mean that
students are immediately expected to be able to use all of these words on their own. However,
through repeated exposure throughout the lessons, they should acquire a good understanding of
most of these words and begin to use some of them in conversation.

~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit, students will practice collecting and synthesizing information by using note-taking
tools such as charts and graphic organizers. Students will also work independently to write a
short opinion on whether they would prefer to live in Athens or Sparta. Toward the end of the unit,
students will begin to explore the genre of fictional writing. They will learn to establish a character
and will incorporate facts about ancient Greece into a piece of fictional writing. During this project,
they will use the writing process to plan, draft, and edit a short piece of fictional writing. During the
editing process, students will focus on editing drafts for prepositions and prepositional phrases,
correct use of pronouns, and using commas in a series and in dates.


**Writing Portfolio**


The following activities may be added to students’ writing portfolios:


  - The Ancient Greek Civilization Notebook (Activity Page 1.1)


  - Draft an Opinion: Which City-State? (Activity Page 7.1)


  - Somebody Wanted But So Then (Activity Page 8.1)


  - Fictional Narrative (Activity Pages 10.1, 11.1, 12.2)

~~**“THE ANCIENT GREEKS” (15 MIN.)**~~


About two thousand eight hundred years ago, there lived a civilization of

people called the ancient Greeks. ~~_[Point to each area on a world map or globe_~~

~~_as you read the following text.]_~~ Today, part of the area where this ancient

civilization lived is called Greece. Long ago, however, the ancient Greeks lived

on a much larger area of land. The **boundaries** ~~_or edges_~~ of ancient Greece

spread widely to the east and west, into many areas bordering on the Black

Sea to the north, and across hundreds of islands in the Mediterranean and

Aegean [/i j *ee* ə n/] Seas. Expeditions ~~_or journeys_~~ by land and by ship

allowed the ancient Greeks to travel as far west as present-day Britain and as

far east as India. ~~_[Show the distance from Greece to Britain and India on the_~~

~~_world map or globe.]_~~ The ancient Greeks traveled to explore far-off lands, and

also to trade—or buy and sell—goods with people from other areas.

The ancient Greeks were similar to other ancient
civilizations, like the Aztec, Maya, and Inca in
some ways. They had writing systems, leaders,
laws, religions, and different people to do
different jobs. Ancient Greeks relied on enslaved
people to work in their civilization. Enslaved
means that they were owned by another person

**Show Image 1A-3: Fishing boat and harbor**


Some Greeks built harbors near the Black,
Aegean, and Mediterranean Seas, and many
became expert sailors and fishermen, using

boats like the one in this image. ~~_[Point to the_~~

~~_boat and then to the coastline in the image.]_~~





~~_Harbors are sheltered places on the water where_~~

~~_ships can safely load and unload their cargo, or_~~



~~_goods._~~ The largest island in the Mediterranean Sea was known—and is still

known today—as Crete. ~~_[Ask a volunteer to point to the island of Crete on_~~

~~_Poster 1.]_~~ Because they were surrounded by water, the ancient Greeks on the
island of Crete became especially skilled seafarers, a name for people such
as fishermen and sailors who earn a living by
working at sea.


**Show Image 1A-4: Mountains and valley**

~~_[Point to the mountains and valley as you read_~~

~~_the following text.]_~~





The high Greek mountains also made a
difference in the way ancient Greece was


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


ruled. Because the mountains split Greece into lots of little valleys, it was
very difficult to move from place to place. Many Greeks stayed in one
place and married people from the same community. Each city in each
valley became its own little nation, which we refer to today as a city-state.
Each city-state had its own government and its own laws, which controlled
the surrounding area. All the ancient Greek city-states shared the same
language, although each city-state had different dialects, or slightly different
ways of speaking the language. ~~_Why did city-states develop on their own?_~~
~~(Because there were many mountains between them.)~~


Sometimes the Greeks had the same ideas of how to live their lives, but they

did those things **independently** of one another. ~~_The word_~~ ~~independently~~

~~_means acting on your own or in a way that is free from the control of other_~~

~~_people or things._~~ In fact, the ancient Greeks were highly competitive, and
only in an emergency would they work together. After each emergency, each
city-state would go back to independently minding its own business. People
in each city-state thought of themselves less as united Greeks and more as
citizens of their particular city-state.


**Show Image 1A-5: Kings from ancient**
**civilizations (clockwise from top left:**
**Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Inca, Aztec)**


The ancient Greeks looked at the world around
them very differently from the way other
people of their time looked at things. For
example, you are going to hear the story of
how one city-state decided not to have a king
anymore. Not only was this different from what other Greeks were doing, it
was completely different from what the Mesopotamians and Egyptians had
done before and from what the Aztec, Inca, and other civilizations would do
in the future.


You will hear more about this later. For now, all I will say is that the Greeks

had a **unique** ~~_or special and one-of-a-kind_~~ way of seeing and thinking about
things. We have a lot of exciting adventures ahead of us as we learn about the
unique way the ancient Greeks lived and thought about things, and how their

many **contributions** are a part of our lives today. ~~_Contributions are things or_~~

~~_ideas that are shared and passed on because they are helpful and good._~~

1. **Literal** What is a civilization? _(a large group of people living together in a_
_well-organized way)_


2. **Literal** Ancient Greek government was organized by city-states. What is a
city-state? _(an independent city and the surrounding area it controlled)_


3. **Inferential** Describe the terrain, or land, of ancient Greece. _(rugged, rocky,_
_not near a river, surrounded by seas; not as fertile for growing crops as land in_
_other areas)_


4. **Inferential** How did this terrain affect how the ancient Greek civilization
developed? _(People farmed less and used the surrounding seas more for_
_fishing, trade, and travel.)_


5. **Evaluative** _Think-Pair-Share:_ How were the ancient Greeks unique, or
special? _(They had city-states that acted independently, they came up with a_
_way not to be ruled by a king, etc.)_


6. After hearing today’s Read-Aloud and questions and answers, do you
have any remaining questions? [Make note of these questions to see if
students can answer them themselves as they learn new information


~~**WORD WORK: INDEPENDENTLY (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Sometimes the Greeks had the same ideas
of how to live their lives, but they did those things independently of one
another.”


2. Say the word _independently_ with me.


3. If you do something independently, you do it on your own, without the
influence or help of someone or something else.


4. The mother bird feeds the baby bird until it is big enough to feed itself
independently.


5. Have you ever done something independently or seen someone else doing
something independently? Try to use the word _independently_ when you tell
about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the
students’ responses: “I independently when . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**TEKS 2.13.A** Generate questions for formal and informal inquiry with adult assistance.


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


**Use an Antonyms activity for follow-up.** The antonym, or opposite, of the
word _independently_ is _dependently._ The prefix _in–_ often makes a word have
an opposite meaning, just like the prefix _un–_ . What do you think _dependently_
means? [Prompt students to realize that _dependently_ means acting with help
from someone or something else.] If you do something dependently, you are
relying on someone or something else for what you need. For example, pets
live dependently on their owners, but wild animals survive independently,
without the help of humans.


Check for Understanding


There are other words that have _in–_ at the beginning and if you
remove the _in–_ you make the antonym. [Say each of the following
words on the T-chart and ask students to define the word without
and then with the prefix. Then, if there is time, allow students to
think of their own examples.]


      - visible/invisible


      - correct/incorrect


      - active/inactive



Challenge


Ask students to think
of their own words with
the prefix _in–_ . Then,
challenge them to see
if the word has the
opposite meaning when
you remove _in–._

~~_carries messages and does errands._~~ Hermes was wearing his famous winged
sandals and winged helmet, and he carried a small wooden stick, or baton,
with wings on either side. All of these extra wings gave Hermes even greater

speed than he already possessed ~~_or had_~~ . Because he was constantly flitting

here and there, ~~_or moving lightly and quickly_~~ carrying news among the gods
and leading lost travelers back in the right direction, Hermes needed all the
speed he could get. When he was moving his fastest, it always seemed as if—
WHOOSH!—he just appeared out of nowhere.


Apollo, the mythical god of music and poetry, was startled when Hermes
suddenly appeared, even though he should have been used to it by now. “Do

you have to pop up like that?” he protested ~~_or said with disapproval_~~ “I was just
composing the most wonderful song on my harp, and you have made me forget

where I was in the melody.” ~~_If Apollo is composing a song, what is he doing?_~~


“So sorry,” Hermes exclaimed, although he was secretly pleased, for he was a

bit of a trickster. ~~_What is a trickster?_~~ Hermes went on, “But soon you will have
more of an audience, for our father, Zeus, has **summoned** ~~_or called_~~ us all
here to the great hall at once.” Glancing around nervously, he added quietly,

“And you know how he can be when he is kept waiting.” ~~_Who is Zeus?_~~ ~~(the~~

~~king of the mythical gods and goddesses)~~


**Show Image 2A-4: Hermes listening to**
**Apollo’s song**





Hermes looked at the harp he had given to
Apollo long ago, made from the shell of a large
tortoise with strings stretched across it. “Still,
I can stay for a moment if you would be kind
enough to play whatever you were working on.”
He sat down on a thick cushion on the floor.



Apollo smiled, and because he was also the mythical god of light, his smile
could truly light up a room. “I would be delighted,” he said, and his fingers ran

so swiftly ~~_or quickly_~~ across the harp strings that they seemed almost liquid.
As always, the song was so beautiful that anyone listening would think it
must be the best song that could ever be played—that is, until Apollo played
the next one.


Hermes actually sat unmoving, which was quite rare for him, and at the end
of the song, he sighed. Then he was gone, his parting “thank you” hanging

in the air. Apollo thought, “That boy must learn to slow down.” ~~_Why is it rare_~~

~~_for Hermes to sit still?_~~ ~~(Because he is a messenger and always hurrying to~~

~~deliver messages.)~~

**27**


**Show Image 2A-5: Stag appearing before**
**Hermes in forest**


Hermes had already left behind the high,
cloud-covered mountain, and he was settling

down into a lush ~~_or thick and healthy_~~ green
forest below. Here, Hermes was especially
alert, for he was searching for the greatest of
hunters—or rather, huntresses—his sister, the



mythical goddess Artemis [/ar*t ə *m ə s/]. If anything could travel as quickly
as Hermes, it would be one of Artemis’s arrows, for she was the goddess of
hunting, wilderness, and animals.


Hermes could hear the crashing and crackling of branches as something

large broke through the trees nearby. Suddenly, a great, antlered stag ~~_or_~~

~~_male deer_~~ burst from the bushes not five feet from Hermes, panic in its

eyes as it saw him. ~~_Why do you think the stag has panic, or fear, in its eyes?_~~

~~(Because Artemis is hunting the deer.)~~ Turning, the stag disappeared from
the little clearing as suddenly as it had arrived. Hermes had only enough time
to think, “How graceful!” when two huge hounds leaped from the bushes,
ready to follow the stag. Hermes simply held up his wooden baton, and the
two dogs stopped at once, lying down before him, panting.


**Show Image 2A-6: Hermes talking to**
**Artemis, dogs lying at their feet**





A moment later, their owner, Artemis,
appeared. Disappointment showed on the
goddess’s face at losing the deer she had been
hunting. At such moments, Artemis could be
cruel, but when she saw Hermes, she smiled,
for she was very fond of him.



**28**



“I wondered why the hounds had stopped,” she said.


“I’m afraid that you will have to stop also,” Hermes replied. “Our father Zeus

has summoned us to come to Mount Olympus as quickly as possible.” ~~_What_~~

~~_words help you understand what_~~ ~~summoned~~ ~~_means?_~~


At once, Artemis placed the arrow she had been holding into the quiver she
wore over her shoulder. “I will leave right away,” she said, but as Hermes
flew off again, he saw her looking **longingly** ~~_or with great want_~~ at the bushes

where the deer had disappeared. ~~_Why do you think Artemis is looking_~~

~~_longingly at the bushes?_~~ ~~(Because she wants to catch the deer.)~~


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


**Show Image 2A-7: Hermes diving through the**
**waves**


A minute later, the messenger god hovered in
midair, high above the sea that surrounded
Greece and which held hundreds of islands
of all sizes. With eyes as sharp as one of
Artemis’s arrows, Hermes shot through the
ocean waves. Weaving among a dozen dancing



dolphins, he came to rest next to the **massive** ~~_or very large_~~ shoulders of his

uncle Poseidon [/p ə *sie*d ə n/], the god of the seas and of all that crosses
the seas.


**Show Image 2A-8: Hermes and Poseidon**
**talking, watching ocean performance**


Poseidon’s long, white beard moved like
sea foam in the water as he turned and
spoke. “Hermes, you are welcome here!” he
boomed out in a mighty voice, and Hermes
remembered that Poseidon, brother of Zeus,
could make the earth shake, for he was also

the mythical god of earthquakes. Pointing his great trident, ~~_[Point to the_~~

~~_trident in the image.]_~~ a three-pointed pitchfork which he sometimes used to
stir up the waves of the sea, the sea god said to Hermes, “Watch with me.”


So the two gods watched as the dolphins swam in smooth, wide figureeights, and massive whales rose up from the depths to swim through the
loops of the dolphins’ design. When the show was over, a hundred octopi

jetted ~~_or moved quickly_~~ in front of the whales and dolphins, shooting
black ink from their bellies as a sort of closing theatre curtain to end the

performance. ~~Octopi~~ ~~_is plural for_~~ ~~octopus~~ ~~_—one octopus, many octopi._~~
Poseidon roared with laughter at this surprise ending. Then, turning to
Hermes, he asked, “What brings you here, nephew?”


Hermes replied, “Zeus asks you to come with all speed to Mount Olympus.”


“I shall go at once,” he said. But before he set out to see his brother,
Poseidon took the time to thank the dolphins, whales, and octopi for their
performance. When he finished, Hermes was already gone. “It is wonderful
how he does that,” Poseidon thought.

the gods, was on a **mission** for his father, Zeus,

the king of the gods. ~~_A mission is a special job_~~





~~_or task. What is Hermes’s mission?_~~ Zeus was

calling the most powerful gods back to the



palace at the very top of Mount Olympus. Already Hermes had passed along

Zeus’s message to Apollo—the handsome mythical god of music, poetry, and

light—and to Apollo’s sister, the huntress Artemis. Hermes had also carried

the message to Zeus’s brother, the mighty Poseidon, mythical god of the sea.

Hermes’s task was not yet done, however, and now he hovered above Greece,

looking and listening for the signs that would lead him to the next god he

wished to find.


This did not take long. In the distance, Hermes saw flashes of light from

Earth beneath him. Flying in that direction, he soon heard screams and angry

shouts, and now he could see below him two armies engaged ~~_or involved_~~ in

a battle. The lights Hermes had seen were flashes of sunlight reflecting off

armor and weapons. The soldiers of one army were pushing back the soldiers

of another army, which had now begun to panic and run.


**Show Image 3A-2: Ares explaining battle to**
**Hermes**

Perched on a cloud high above the battle, and

clearly excited by the **spectacle** below, stood

Ares [/aer*eez/], the mythical god of war. ~~_A_~~

~~_spectacle is an eye-catching sight._~~ Dressed all





in red, tall and strong he stood, and his smile

grew broader as Hermes landed beside him.



“Hail, brother!” said Ares, for he was also a son of Zeus. Pointing down, he

asked, “Isn’t it glorious? ~~_or magnificent_~~ Here are humans at their best and

worst, some displaying heroic courage and others cowardly fear.”


He pointed, and a beam of light shone on one of the desperate soldiers. ~~_If you_~~

~~_are desperate, you are in need of something and will do anything to change_~~

~~_your situation._~~ “I have been watching that fellow there,” said Ares. “See how

he seeks to bring his fellow soldiers together to win the battle?”


Hermes had never understood his brother’s attraction to battle, but it would

not do to say so. Hermes thought to himself, “It seems to me that the best

elements of humans are love, loyalty, and learning—not fighting.” To Ares he

said, “Zeus summons us all to Mount Olympus.”


Without taking his eyes off of the battle below, Ares nodded and said, “I’ll be

there.” ~~_What is Ares the mythical god of?_~~ ~~(war)~~

he found his sister Athena [/ ə *thee*n ə /],

another daughter of Zeus and mythical

goddess of wisdom and war, walking among a **grove** of olive trees. ~~_A grove_~~

~~_is a group of trees growing or planted near one another._~~ With Athena was

Zeus’s sister, Demeter [/ d ə *mee*ter/], mythical goddess of plants and of

the harvest. In her wise, intelligent voice, Athena was saying, “And so, dear

aunt, would you please make sure that this year’s crop of olives is especially

plentiful for the people of Athens?” ~~_The word_~~ ~~plentiful~~ ~~_is like the word_~~

**Hephaestus’s forge**

Hermes was off once more to his last stop—

back to Mount Olympus, where he had started.

There, Hermes followed the loud clang, clang,

clang of metal striking on metal. His brother

Hephaestus [/hif*es*t ə s/], the mythical

god of fire and the blacksmith of the gods,

was standing by his red-hot forge with a huge, heavy hammer in each hand,

striking them in turn against a jagged lightning bolt. ~~_A forge is a place where_~~

~~_a blacksmith works to heat metal and shape it into different objects. [Point to_~~

~~_the anvil as you read the next sentence.]_~~ The lightning bolt was being shaped

on top of an anvil, a heavy block of iron or steel with a smooth, flat top. Waiting

outside to carry the lightning bolt to Zeus—who, as you remember, was the

mythical god of lightning and thunder—was a magnificent winged horse named

Pegasus [/ peg* ə *s ə s/]. ~~_You will hear more about this amazing horse later._~~


Hephaestus did not even notice Hermes until the messenger god called out,

loudly enough to be heard over the hammer strokes, “Greetings, brother!”


**Show Image 3A-5: Hermes and Hephaestus**
**speaking**

Hephaestus stopped hammering and,

wiping the sweat from his brow, looked

over at Hermes. The two mythical gods,

though brothers, appeared to be opposites.

Hephaestus was huge and muscular in his

upper body, but slow-moving due to an injury

that had left his legs badly damaged. Hermes was slender and so smooth

that he seemed almost to dance in all of his movements.

Hephaestus’s face broke out into a big grin when he saw the messenger

god. “Brother, where have you been while I have been tied down here at my

forge?” he asked in his slow way. ~~_If Hephaestus is tied down, this means he is_~~

~~_very busy and unable to leave because he has so much to do._~~


“Practically everywhere!” Hermes answered. ~~_What are some of the places_~~

~~_where Hermes has been?_~~ “Zeus has sent me to summon everyone to the

great hall.”


By “everyone” Hermes meant the main gods, of whom he himself was one. In

fact, there was only one left to contact. “Would you ask your wife to join us?”

he asked.


Hephaestus frowned. “She does not like to be awakened this early,” he said,

even though it was nearly noon by now, “but if it is for Zeus, I will do it.”


**Show Image 3A-6: Sleeping Aphrodite;**

**Hephaestus and Hermes talking**

Hephaestus’s wife was the most beautiful of all

the mythical goddesses, the goddess of beauty

itself and of love: Aphrodite [/af*r ə *die*tee/].

Aphrodite was as used to luxury ~~_or comforts_~~

as Hephaestus was to hard work.


Hephaestus told Hermes, “We will come.”

gathered. ~~_[Point to each of the mythical gods_~~

Athena in a laughing voice, “I’m sorry I look

stunning. ~~_or very beautiful_~~


Athena had no chance to reply, for now the king and queen of them all,

Zeus and Hera, entered. Hera ~~_[Point to the mythical goddess in purple in the_~~

~~_image.]_~~ was the mythical goddess of feminine power and women’s lives. She

knew why Zeus had summoned them all: the family of the Olympian gods

was about to welcome a new member.


Zeus raised a hand for silence, smiled, and announced, “Today is a special day.

Today we invite to join us here on Mount Olympus a new god, the youngest of

us all. Please welcome Dionysus, the god of grapes and diversion.” ~~Diversion~~

~~_means to distract the mind to something else._~~

household of the mythical gods and goddesses

atop Mount Olympus, completing what is

known as the twelve Olympian gods. ~~_[Point_~~

~~_to the mythical gods and goddesses, and ask_~~

~~_volunteers to name each.]_~~


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~



1.



**Inferential** Did Hermes accomplish his mission? Why or why not? _(Yes, he_
_delivered the message to all of the mythical gods and goddesses that had_
_been summoned by Zeus.)_



2. **Literal** Name and describe the mythical Olympian gods and goddesses
you heard about in this story. [Show students Images 3A-2, 3A-3, 3A-4,
3A-6, and 3A-7 to help them remember.] _(Ares, mythical god of war; Athena,_
_mythical goddess of wisdom and war; Demeter, mythical goddess of plants_
_and the harvest; Hephaestus, mythical god of fire and blacksmith of the gods;_
_Aphrodite, mythical goddess of love and beauty; Hera, queen of the mythical_
_gods; Dionysus, mythical god of grapes and diversion.)_


3. **Evaluative** How did the powers and skills of the mythical gods and
goddesses you heard about help explain how things came to be or how things
happened in nature? _(Ares caused war; Athena was the source of wisdom and_
_war; Demeter caused the seasons to happen and plants to grow; Hephaestus_
_made the lightning bolts for Zeus to throw; etc.)_

   - **Literal** Hermes found his brother Hephaestus in the forge. What was
Hephaestus doing in the forge? _(shaping a lightning bolt for Zeus out of_
_metal on an anvil)_


   - **Literal** What did Athena ask Demeter to do for the people of Athens? _(to_
_make their olive crop more plentiful, or greater in number)_



Challenge


Compare and contrast
two mythical Greek
gods and goddesses
(e.g., Hermes and
Hephaestus).


Challenge


Why do you think all
the mythical gods
and goddesses are
so different from one
another and have their
own special powers or
abilities?



Lesson 3 Mount Olympus, Part II
**43**


Flip Book 3A-8



**Show Image 3A-8: All twelve mythical gods seated on their thrones**


4. **Evaluative** _Think-Pair-Share:_ Remember, the ancient Greeks believed in
many mythical gods and goddesses. If you could be a mythical Olympian god
or goddess, which one would you be? Why? Be sure to support your answer
with things we heard about in the Read-Aloud. _(Answers may vary, but_
_students should talk about traits specific to mythical gods and goddesses.)_


~~**WORD WORK: MISSION (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud, you heard, “Hermes, messenger of the gods, was on a
mission for his father, Zeus, the king of the gods.”


2. Say the word _mission_ with me.


3. A mission is a special job or task.


4. Tricia was on a mission to collect as many cans as she could for the canned
food drive at her school.


5. Have you ever been on a mission or been given a mission? Try to use the
word _mission_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses: “I was on a mission once
when . . . ” or “ gave me a mission to . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What does the word _mission_
mean?


**Use a Sharing activity for follow-up.** Tell about a mission you have had and
what the outcome of your mission was. Remember to answer in complete
sentences, and be sure to begin your response with “I went on a mission
to . . . ” [You may wish to give students a specific mission, as individuals or
as a class, pertaining to the unit, such as a research mission, and have them
share the outcome.]


~~**READING AND SPELLING WORDS WITH –ION (5 MIN.)**~~


 - When adding the _–ion_ to a verb, it becomes a noun. It can be confusing to
students ask to when they should use _–tion_ or _–sion_ to spell words because
they all have the same sound (“zhun” or “shun”). We usually add _–sion_ to a
word when:


1. the word ends in the letter _l_ ( _propel_, _propulsion_ )


2. if the suffix will follow


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government



**44**


3. the word originally ends in _–ss_ or _–mit_ ( _discuss_, _discussion_, _admit_,
_admission_ )


 - We usually drop _t_ or _te_ and add _–tion_ to a word when:


1. the word ends in _–ate_ ( _vacate_, _vacation_, _educate_, _education_ )


2. any word that ends in a consonant beside _l_, _n_, or _r_, especially those ending in
_t_ ( _act_, _action_ or _descript_, _description_ )


 - When some words end in _–de_, we drop the ‘de’ and add _–sion_ . For example,
_persuade_, _persuasion_, _conclude_, and _conclusion_ .


 - However, in other words, we drop the _e_ and add _–ation_, like in the words
_declare_ and _declaration_ .


 - Ask students to define _declare_ and _declaration_ . Use a print or digital
resource, if necessary.


**Note:** Students will also encounter words that have the _–ion_ ending in Unit 6.

  - Point to Image Card 1 (farming) on the Civilization Chart, and tell students
the trees in the image on the left are olive trees and the fruits on the right are
the olives. Remind students that they heard about the olive crop in the ReadAloud by rereading the following passage:


_Here [Hermes] found his sister Athena, another daughter of Zeus and_

_mythical goddess of wisdom and war, walking among a grove of olive trees._

_With Athena was Zeus’s sister, Demeter, mythical goddess of plants and of_

_the harvest. In her wise, intelligent voice, Athena was saying, “And so, dear_

_aunt, would you please make sure that this year’s crop of olives is especially_

_plentiful for the people of Athens?” Gently, Demeter answered, “I shall be_

_delighted.” Instantly, the nearby olive leaves turned a deeper shade of green._


  - Tell students olives were an important source of food for the ancient Greeks
and so farming olives was a very important job.

**Note to Teacher**


**Sayings and Phrases:** Proverbs are short, traditional sayings that have
been passed along orally from generation to generation. These sayings
usually express general truths based on experiences and observations of
everyday life. Although some proverbs do have literal meanings—that is, they
mean exactly what they say—many proverbs have a richer meaning beyond
the literal level. It is important to help students understand the difference
between the literal meaning of the words and the implied or figurative
meaning.

Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


**Show Image 4A-2: Olympic events**

The Olympic Games were held every four

years at the site of Olympia ~~_[Point to Olympia_~~

~~_on Poster 1.]_~~ and included contests in which

ancient Greek athletes would **compete** ~~_or try_~~

~~_hard to win a contest_~~ . Because these games

were part of a religious festival ~~_or celebration_~~

to honor the king of their mythical gods, Zeus,



they were considered **sacred** . ~~Sacred~~ ~~_means holy or worthy of respect._~~ In the

first Olympic Games, there were only footraces, or running races. Later came

events like wrestling, boxing, racing horses and chariots, throwing the heavy

stone discus, and throwing the javelin [/jav* ə *l ə n/], a type of long spear.


**Show Image 4A-3: Myron speaking to Pindar**

**in carriage**

Among the travelers to the games one year

were two men named Myron [/mie*r ə n/] and

Pindar [/pin*der/]. ~~_Myron and Pindar were_~~

~~_real artists who lived in ancient Greece._~~ They





made their way to the sacred site of Olympia

in a private carriage drawn by a team of horses



and driven by a servant. ~~_If they were riding in a private carriage, do you think_~~

~~_Myron and Pindar were wealthy or just like everybody else?_~~ The passenger

in the brown cloak, Myron, was so muscular that other travelers wondered,

“Is he one of the Olympic athletes?” But Myron was not an athlete; he was a

sculptor who used his muscular arms and huge hands to carve statues out of

bronze and marble.


Myron was telling his traveling companion, “Of course you are right, Pindar. I

could just invite the champions ~~_or winners_~~ to my home after the competition

and carve statues of them there. But I want my statues to show the exact

moment when a runner starts to pull ahead in a race, or the instant when

a discus thrower is about to let go of that heavy stone and fling it down the

field. So I prefer to see those Olympic events with my own eyes.”


His friend Pindar smiled and answered, “I, on the other hand, have written

poems in honor of champions without ever having seen them compete.

But I am less interested in watching a runner cross the finish line in first

place than I am in the effort and **determination** it took for him to get there.

~~Determination~~ ~~_means firm purpose or resolve to accomplish something._~~ It

is this I admire, and it is about this that I write.” ~~_Pindar’s poems were called_~~


Lesson 4 The Olympic Games
**55**


~~_odes and were written to be sung together with instruments and dancing at_~~

~~_special occasions like banquets and festivals._~~


Myron grinned. “Well, your way works for you, just as mine works for me.”


**Show Image 4A-4: Pindar speaking to friend**

Suddenly a voice called out, “Pindar! What

are you doing with that Athenian? Don’t you

know we Thebans [/thee*b ə nz/] are still

fighting a war against Athens?” ~~_[Show Athens_~~

~~_and Thebes on Poster 1.] Athens and Thebes_~~






~~_[/ theebz/] were two city-states in Greece that_~~

~~_did not get along. Pindar was from Thebes, and_~~



**56**



~~_Myron was from Athens. You will hear more about these city-states later._~~


Turning, Pindar recognized a friend from his hometown of Thebes. Directing

his carriage driver to stop the horses, Pindar said, “My friend, you know

that all such conflicts ~~_or fights_~~ are set aside here. Everyone is guaranteed

~~_or promised_~~ safe passage going to, and returning from, the Olympic Games,

so that all may gather to take part in this **grand** ~~_or amazing_~~ competition to

honor Zeus and the other gods.” The Olympic Games were more important

than the conflicts the city-states were having with each other, and these

conflicts were put on hold so everyone could gather safely for these sacred

games.


Pindar went on, “Besides, Myron and I are artists. When I write a poem, or

when Myron carves a statue, our interest goes far beyond the boundaries of

any one city. ~~_What are boundaries? (edges)_~~ We honor these champions as

examples, so we might encourage all Greeks to do the best they can in their

own lives. This is how we honor the gods, who gave us our hearts, minds, and

muscles.” ~~_The Greeks believed that the mythical gods created humans and_~~

~~_gave them the talents that they possessed._~~


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


**Show Image 4A-5: Ancient Olympian victor**

**with laurel crown**

By the time Pindar and Myron reached

Olympia, the greatest athletes in the Greek

world had already gathered. Pindar and Myron

looked around excitedly at the running track,

the long jump pit, and the vast ~~_or very large_~~

horse racing stadium. In the distance, thick

clouds hid the peaks of Mount Olympus.


All of the athletes were men, for there were no events for women in the

original Olympic Games—with the exception of the horse and chariot races. If

women owned horses, they were allowed to enter them in the races, but they

were not the ones who rode the horses or drove the chariots. Women were

not even allowed to be present at the Olympic Games to see their horses win.


**Victory** ~~_or winning_~~ was a source of great pride for the winners and their

home cities. An Olympic champion received a wreath of laurel leaves to wear

atop his head. ~~_[Point to the wreath in the image.]_~~ But more than that, he knew

his name would live forever as a hero in his city’s history. In fact, many city
states awarded large sums of money to their champions.


**Show Image 4A-6: Photos of modern athletes**

In some regards, things have not changed

much in the twenty-seven centuries since the

first Olympics. Modern athletes, too, may win

fame, even if their greatest reason to compete

is for the love of the sport. ~~_What does_~~ ~~compete~~

~~_mean?_~~ The Summer Olympics are still held

every four years, but now there are also



Winter Olympics—with winter sports such as skiing, bobsledding, and figure

skating—that are held two years after every Summer Olympics. ~~_So today,_~~

~~_there are Olympic Games every two years._~~ The location of the Olympic Games

also changes each time; they have been hosted in cities such as Seoul [/

soel/], Korea; Atlanta, Georgia; and Athens, Greece. Men—and now women—

from all over the world travel to the chosen city to compete. Even if their

countries are not getting along, people usually set aside their conflicts, just

as in the ancient days, in honor of the games.

**Show Image 4A-7: The Discus Thrower**

Even though many centuries have passed

since Myron and Pindar traveled to the

Olympics, they, too, are still remembered.

Today, Myron’s depiction of an Olympic

champion, The Discus Thrower, remains one

of the most famous statues in the world. The

original statue was lost long ago, perhaps in a

war or an earthquake. But fortunately, someone made an exact copy, so we

can still admire Myron’s work.


**Show Image 4A-8: Visiting Delphic temple;**

**statue of Apollo in background**

As for the poet Pindar, the Greeks loved his

poems so much that for centuries after his

death, he was remembered by the people

at Apollo’s temple. ~~_Each mythical god and_~~





~~_goddess had a temple in Greece with a statue._~~

~~_The Greeks would go to the temples and offer_~~



~~_gifts to their mythical gods._~~ They would pray at closing each night, “Let

Pindar the poet attend the supper of the gods.” Later still, when the Greek

king, Alexander the Great, ordered that Pindar’s home city of Thebes be

destroyed in a war, Alexander commanded his soldiers, “But keep Pindar’s

house safe from the flames!” Pindar’s ideas about doing our best with

whatever talents we are given, and about getting along peacefully with one

another, remain part of our thinking today. In fact, we still call this way of

seeing things “the Olympic spirit.”

5. Have you ever experienced something grand? Try to use the word _grand_
when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or
rephrase the students’ responses: “ was grand because . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Synonyms and Antonyms activity for follow-up.** You have heard
that the word _grand_ means impressive in size, appearance, or general
character. The word _ordinary_ is an antonym, or opposite, of the word _grand_ .
_Ordinary_ means unimpressive or everyday. I am going to read several
sentences. If I describe something that is grand, say, “That is grand.” If I
describe something that is ordinary, say, “That is ordinary.”


**Note:** Answers may vary depending on students’ opinions. Allow a few
students to give a reason for their choice after each example.


 - a very large swimming pool with a waterfall and a slide


 - your bedroom


 - the Olympics


 - the school cafeteria


 - a fancy building with huge rooms, tall ceilings, and special decorations

  - Create a physical representation of the isolation of Greek city-states to
reinforce the idea that geography (mountains and water) separated citystates, which led to each city-state acting independently of the others. You
may use a set of tall brown blocks to represent the mountains and flat blue
blocks to represent water. Use small figurines to represent the Greek people
of various city-states separated by mountains and water.

##### Introducing the



10M


##### Read-Aloud



**Speaking and Listening:** Students will explain what city-states in ancient Greek
civilization were and why they developed.


~~**TEKS 2.1.A**~~


~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED?**~~


**City-States**
**Show image 1A-4: Mountains and valley**

  - Use the following questions to prompt discussion about city-states:


    - What is a city-state? ( _an independent city and the surrounding area it_
_controlled_ )


    - Why did ancient Greece develop into city-states that acted independently
of one another? _(The high Greek mountains split Greece into lots of little_
_valleys. Each city in each valley became its own little nation, which we refer_
_to today as a city-state.)_


    - Did the Greek city-states depend on one another? Were they always
discussing what to do, and did they share the same government and
rules? Or did they act independently of each other and have their own
governments? _(They acted independently of one another and had their own_
_rules and governments.)_


Check for Understanding


If the land was flat in Greece, how might the city-states have
developed differently? _(might not have been as independent;_
_might have developed as one unified city-state or country, etc.)_


    - What did the city-states have in common? _(They shared the same_
_language and attended the Olympic Games.)_


**TEKS 2.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and answer questions using multi-word responses.


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


 - Remind students how the Greek city-states were highly competitive and
would only work together in an emergency.


 - Read the following passage and review the last Read-Aloud about the
Olympic Games, emphasizing how the city-states put differences aside in
order to participate in this grand competition to honor Zeus and the other
mythical gods.


_A man called out to the poet Pindar as he was speaking with the sculptor_
_Myron, saying, “Pindar! What are you doing with that Athenian? Don’t you_
_know we Thebans are still fighting a war against Athens?”_


_Turning, Pindar recognized a friend from his hometown of Thebes. Directing_

_his carriage driver to stop the horses, Pindar said, “My friend, you know that_

_all such conflicts are set aside here. Everyone is guaranteed safe passage_

_going to, and returning from, the Olympic Games, so that all may gather to_

_take part in this grand competition to honor Zeus and the other gods.” The_

_Olympic Games were more important than the conflicts the city-states were_

_having with each other, and these conflicts were put on hold so everyone_

_could gather safely for these sacred games._


 - Show the locations of the following city-states on Poster 1, explaining their
relevance thus far:


   - Athens (where Myron was from)


   - Thebes (where Pindar was from)


   - Olympia (location of the Olympic Games)


 - Point to Sparta, and explain that today they are going to hear a Read-Aloud
about another city-state called Sparta.

~~_What do you see in this picture?_~~ Lysander

[/ lie*san*der/] was ready. This was his

seventh birthday and also the birthday of

his twin sister, Disa [/dee*z ə /], whose name

means “double.” This would be their last

birthday celebration together, for when a boy

in the city-state of Sparta turned seven, his life changed forever. ~~_How do you_~~

~~_think his life changed forever?_~~


Until now, Lysander had lived at home with his mother and sister.

Occasionally, they saw Lysander’s father whenever he visited home, for

fathers did not live with their families in Sparta. Instead, all Spartan men

served **permanently** ~~_or for all time_~~ in the Spartan army and lived in army

camps.

**Show Image 5A-2: Father showing Lysander**

**training camp**

On one of his visits, Lysander’s father had

explained, “At the age of seven, a Spartan

boy begins his formal training for life in the

army. Spartan soldiers are the greatest in all

of Greece, and if you are to take your place

among us, you must start preparing early. You



must make yourself as strong, as fast, and as tough as you can. I expect you

to run great distances, to climb steep mountainsides, and to swim in rough

waters.” ~~_How would you feel if you had to leave your family at age seven to_~~

~~_train to be a soldier?_~~


Lysander’s father went on. “When I can, I will spend time here and show

you how to use a sword and a spear and how to wrestle, although you will

be trained completely in these and other fighting skills after you join the

other boys in the army training camp. I expect the best from you, as Sparta

expects the best from all of its people.” ~~_What do we know about the Spartan_~~

~~_way of life based on what we have read?_~~


Can you imagine having a conversation like this with one of your parents?

To us today, the Spartan way of life seems terribly hard: Spartans had few

comforts in life and had to accept many hardships. We even use the word

**Spartan** today to describe something difficult that requires you to be strong

in body and mind and that takes a great deal of **self-discipline**, ~~_or training_~~

~~_to improve yourself, usually by giving up some type of luxury or comfort._~~ To

the Spartans, this was the only way they knew how to live. But things had not

always been this way.


**Show Image 5A-3: Spartan army**

Long before the time of Lysander or his father,

Sparta had been just one of the many city
states in Greece. The people of Sparta were

farmers, seafarers, and merchants ~~_or people_~~

~~_who buy, sell, and trade goods_~~, like people in

most other parts of Greece. But when Sparta

grew overpopulated, the city-state decided to

attack another city in order to have more land and food. The Spartans fought

a long war of **conquest** against this city. ~~_That means they forcefully took over_~~

~~_the city._~~


Lesson 5 All for Sparta
**71**


**72**



This war was so difficult to win that the people of Sparta decided, “We will

rebuild our city and make Sparta the strongest military force in the world,

so that no one will be able to attack us or fight back against us. We will

make all of Sparta into one great fighting machine, and every citizen must

do his or her part to make that machine unstoppable. All of our men will be

soldiers, and we will train them to be mighty warriors. Our women will learn

how to run and wrestle so that they, too, will be strong—but their jobs will be

different. The women must be able to give birth to many children and do even

the most difficult jobs at home while the men are off fighting.” ~~_We learned_~~

~~_about another ancient civilization that had a special strategy to protect and_~~

~~_communicate with themselves. What did the ancient Incan civilization do to_~~

~~_pass along messages from the emperor to soldiers and governors? (They had_~~

~~_runners.)_~~


**Show Image 5A-4: Spartan council of two**

**kings and twenty-eight elders**

The military city-state of Sparta completely

changed the way they lived in order to make

this happen. Few people got to vote on how

the government would work or what it would

do. In fact, women were not allowed to vote

or take part in the government at all, but were

supposed to concentrate on life at home. Even among the men, few were

allowed to make decisions.


There were two kings instead of one, so one person could not hold all of

the power for himself. The two Spartan kings, in addition to helping run the

government, led the Spartan armies. If one died in battle, the other would

still be alive to lead the Spartans. To pass laws, there was a **council** ~~_or group_~~

~~_of people chosen to look after the interests of a group_~~ made up of twenty
eight elders and the two kings. Whereas the two kings could be younger, the

other men in the council had to be at least sixty years old to be sure they had

enough life experience to help run the city-state as the Spartans thought it

should be run.


Sparta was mostly what we call “a closed society.” That is, the Spartans

did not conduct a lot of business with other parts of Greece. Instead, they

tried to make or grow in their own city-state all they would need in order to

survive. ~~_So do you think they traded vegetables with other farmers from other_~~

~~_city-states?_~~ ~~(No.)~~ They did not want to open themselves up to other peoples’

ideas of how to live—or to a possible invasion by another city-state.


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


**Show Image 5A-5: Lysander leaving with**

**Platon**

As he celebrated his seventh birthday, Lysander

thought, “Today I will leave my family home to

begin training as a soldier.” ~~_How do you think_~~

~~_Lysander felt?_~~ Later in the day, a husky ~~_or big_~~

~~_and strong_~~ Spartan soldier came to the house

to lead Lysander away. The fellow introduced



himself as Platon [/plat* ə n/], which means broad-shouldered in Greek.


Lysander wanted to look brave in front of him, so he did not cry when he said

goodbye to his mother and sister. Still, when his sister, Disa, whispered, “I will

miss you,” he whispered back, “I’ll miss you, too.”


**Show Image 5A-6: Platon explaining training**
**life to Lysander**

As Lysander marched off with Platon, the

soldier told him, “Your father and I served

together in a war. In fact, he saved my life.

So when I heard his son was going to join us,





I requested the chance to bring you to your

new home.” ~~_So is Platon a friend of Lysander’s_~~



~~_father? Why?_~~ ~~(Yes, because they served together in a war and Lysander’s~~

~~father saved his life.)~~


The soldier continued. “Life at the training camp will be very different from

what you have known. They will take away your shoes so you will learn how to

march and run barefoot in an emergency. You will get rough, old clothing to

wear. It’s not comfortable, but neither is armor, and you may as well get used

to discomfort.” ~~_Discomfort is something that is difficult and without comfort;_~~

~~_it is the opposite of the word_~~ ~~luxury~~ ~~_you heard earlier._~~


**Show Image 5A-7: Boys competing for cheese**

**while being watched by commander**

“As for the food,” Platon grinned, “it’s even

worse than what we soldiers eat, and there’s

not enough to fill your belly. But sometimes

the soldiers will offer you and the other boys





some nice, fresh cheese—if you can get to it.

The soldiers won’t make it easy for you. Only

Exit Pass


On an index card, write one sentence describing the city-state of
Sparta in ancient Greece. Be as descriptive as possible. You may
draw a picture on the back to support your sentence.


~~**WORD WORK: SPARTAN (5 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 5A-3: Spartan army**


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard the word _Spartan_ used in two ways. The first
way describes the people of ancient Sparta. [Point to Image 5A-3.] For
example, “Instead, all Spartan men served permanently or for all time in the
Spartan army and lived in army camps.” This sentence describes the army of
ancient Sparta.


2. The second way the word _Spartan_ is used in the Read-Aloud is to describe
things today. In the Read-Aloud, it states, “We even use the word _Spartan_
today to describe something difficult that requires you to be strong in body
and mind and that takes a great deal of self-discipline.”


3. Say the word _Spartan_ with me. Let’s talk some more about _Spartan_ as it’s
used to describe things today.


4. When I go camping with my mother for a week, we live a Spartan life with only
one change of clothes, a tent, and some canned food.


5. Can you name something you have to do that is Spartan? Try to use the word
_Spartan_ when you tell about it. Remember, we are not using the word _Spartan_
to refer to the people of ancient Sparta. Make sure your example is from life
today. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the
students’ responses: “I live a Spartan life when . . .”]

**Use an Antonyms activity for follow-up.** The opposite of _Spartan_ is
_luxurious_ . If you live a Spartan life, you are uncomfortable and go without
many things, but if you live a luxurious life, you have even more than you
could ever need. Tell about what a Spartan life is like and what a luxurious life
is like. Remember to answer in complete sentences, and be sure to use the

~~**“ATHENS AND THE OLIVE TREE” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 6A-1: Athenians beginning**
**construction of city**

Far from the city-state of Sparta, another group

of Greeks found the **ideal** ~~_or perfect_~~ place to

build yet another new city-state. “That high hill

will be the perfect place to build a city around,”





these Greeks said. “There is also a good harbor

for boats just a short distance away.” ~~_[Point to_~~



~~_Image Card 3 (seafaring) on the Civilization Chart.] What is a harbor? Why did_~~

~~_the ancient Greeks want to build their city-state near a good harbor?_~~


Almost all Greek cities were built around high hills. That way, if an enemy

tried to attack the lower areas of the city, the people would climb up and

gather on the high hill behind the city walls, where it would be harder for the

enemy to reach them.


**Show Image 6A-2: Poseidon showing off the**

**greatness of the sea**

Now that this group of Greeks had found just

the place they were looking for, they needed

a name for their city. One of the Greek stories

tells us that while the Greeks were trying





to decide on a name for their new city, an

amazing thing happened: two of the gods appeared to the people and spoke

to them.


The first appearance came when the Greeks were gathered at the nearby

harbor. The huge, muscular figure of Poseidon rose up from the sea. ~~_What was_~~

~~_Poseidon the mythical god of?_~~ ~~(sea and earthquakes)~~ All around him, dolphins

leaped and played in the waves, and seabirds circled in the air around his

towering head and shoulders that seemed to almost reach the clouds.


“Hear me, humans!” Poseidon boomed. Even those farthest from the shore

could hear his loud voice. “You would be wise listen to me, for I can bring

you good luck in your fishing.” ~~_Would good luck in fishing be important to the_~~

~~_ancient Greeks?_~~ ~~(Yes, seafaring was important to them, and fish provided~~

~~them with food.)~~


He lifted his vast hands and said, “Look!” Hundreds of fish leaped from the

waves and sank back again. Lowering his hands, Poseidon, who was the

mythical god of the seas and of all that crosses the seas including ships,

continued, “I can also bless the safety of your fishermen while they ride upon

my waves, and see to it that the ships in which your merchants trade move

**swiftly** ~~_or very quickly_~~ and smoothly to distant shores and back home again.”

~~_What are merchants?_~~ ~~(people who buy, sell, or trade things)~~


The people were **overjoyed** ~~_or very happy_~~ to hear his words, and turning to

one another, they said, “How wonderful! We will have fish, and our fishermen

will be safe upon the waves.”


**Show Image 6A-3: Athena addressing the**

**people; presenting an olive tree**

But, according to the story, before they could

say this to the god of the sea, another voice

called out to them, “Hear me, O people, for I

too, offer you a gift and a **blessing** .” ~~_A blessing_~~





~~_is a divine, or holy, gift._~~ This time it was a

female voice they heard, speaking in calm,



clear, intelligent tones. ~~_Who do you think was speaking?_~~


Lesson 6 Athens and the Olive Tree
**85**


All the people turned in the direction of this new voice and saw before them

Athena, the mythical goddess of wisdom and of war. ~~_Were your predictions_~~

~~_about who was speaking correct?_~~ Athena told the people, “The gift I offer

you is this.” She, too, lifted a hand, but instead of anything as dramatic as

hundreds of fish leaping up, all that appeared on the ground was one, single,

graceful tree. It grew high and wide on the very spot where a moment before

the ground had been empty.


“This is an olive tree,” Athena said. ~~_[Point to the tree in the Flip Book. Then_~~

~~_point to the tree on Image Card 1 (farming) on the Ancient Greek Civilization_~~

~~_Chart. What kind of tree did the Greeks farm?_~~ ~~(olive tree)~~


The people did not want to be rude to the goddess, but they whispered

to one another, “She offers us one tree? It is very pretty to look at, but it

is nothing compared to Poseidon’s blessings.” ~~_What are blessings? Which_~~

~~_blessing do you think is better and why?_~~


**Show Image 6A-4: Many uses of the olive**
**tree**

Hearing all, Athena smiled and said, “Let me

tell you about this tree. One day soon, all of

these lands around you—even the rocky hills

beyond that are hard to farm—will be covered





with groves and groves of these olive trees.

~~_Remember, when Hermes found them, Athena_~~

**86**



~~_and Demeter were walking through the olive tree groves._~~ From these trees

will come the wealth of your city, for you will eat the fruit you pick from

these trees and never go hungry. The oil you squeeze from the fruit will be so

delicious that its flavor will improve anything you cook with it. Fill a lamp with

the olive oil, set a dry rope wick in it, and **ignite** it, ~~_or set fire to it_~~ and you will

have light in the darkest hour of the night. Mix other sweet-smelling herbs

into the oil and rub it onto your skin, and you will be healthier and cleaner

and smell sweeter. And because the oil will stay fresh in jugs and bottles for

a long time, you can ship it to other lands far and near, for many people will

want to have these blessings of the olive for themselves.”


**Show Image 6A-5: Olive tree**

“The tree itself will be a blessing, too, for in its

shade you will find shelter from the heat of the

summer sun and from the cold rains of winter.

~~_What is shelter?_~~ ~~(cover and safety)~~ The wood





of this tree will be fine for carving, so you will

never lack for bowls, plates, or furniture. The tree will live for hundreds of

years, and if a fire burns it down, it will grow again from the stump that is left

behind.”


Athena continued, “And I tell you this as the goddess of war: The olive branch

will become the symbol of peace. Call to me when you are in danger, and I will

protect you.” Athena gestured to ~~_or pointed to_~~ the olive tree and said, “Here,

then, is food, fortune, and protection that will be the great blessings of your

people forever—if you choose me.” ~~_Which gift do you think these Greeks will_~~

~~_choose?_~~


**Show Image 6A-6: People choosing Athena**

The people thought about what Poseidon and

Athena had offered and came to a decision.

They told the god of the sea, “Great Poseidon,

you have offered us wonderful things. We will

always be grateful to you for the riches of the

sea—however much you choose to share them



from your great and generous heart. But we will be the people of Athena and

her olive tree.” ~~_Were your predictions about how Athens got its name correct?_~~

~~_How did you know? Olive trees still grow in abundance in Greece today._~~


To Athena, the people said, “To show our devotion ~~_or loyalty_~~ to you, we will

name our new city ‘Athens’ in honor of you and your blessings.”


And that, the story tells us, is how these Greeks came to call their city

Athens.

**Reading:** Students will describe the city-states Sparta and Athens.


~~**TEKS 2.1.A**~~


~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED? (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Refer to the Ancient Greek Civilization Chart and Poster 1. Have students
point to the city-states of Sparta and Athens on Poster 1.


  - Point to the “City-States” column on the Civilization Chart, and ask students
what they see in the images and what they remember about these city-states
of ancient Greece.


  - Use the following questions to prompt discussion:


Check for Understanding


       - What city-states have we learned about so far? _(Sparta and_
_Athens; Students may also mention Thebes and Olympia, which_
_they heard about in Lesson 4.)_


      - What makes them city-states? _(They are independent cities, each_
_with its own government and way of life.)_


    - How did the city-state of Sparta become so focused on war? _(The_
_people of Sparta fought in a long and hard war to gain more land and_
_food, and decided they wanted to make sure that didn’t happen again, so_
_they decided to train hard to become the best soldiers so no one could_
_defeat them.)_


    - What are some adjectives and other words you could use to describe
life in Sparta? _(harsh, self-disciplined, full of discomfort, tough, brave_
_soldiers, etc.)_

  - How did the city-state Athens get its name? _(The mythical goddess Athena_
_offered the Athenians the blessing of olive trees in return for their devotion._
_The people of Athens named the city after her.)_


  - What were all of the benefits of the olive tree that Athena went on to
describe? _(olives to eat; olive oil for cooking; filling a lamp with oil and_
_igniting the wick to provide light; keeping skin healthy; trading; wood from_
_the trees for shade and carving)_


- Tell students that they are going to hear more about the city-state of Athens
and how it was very different from the city-state of Sparta. Encourage
students to ask questions throughout the lesson as they learn more about
the city states.


- Remind students that in the last story, the mythical goddess Athena said to
the people of Athens, “And I tell you this as the mythical goddess of war: The
olive branch will become the symbol of peace. Call to me when you are in
danger, and I will protect you.”

~~**“ATHENS: THE BIRTHPLACE OF DEMOCRACY” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 7A-1: Hiero and Dion talking in**
**front of the agora**

Hiero [/heer*oe/] and Dion were on their way

to Dion’s home, passing through the central

marketplace of Athens, where people spent

as much time conversing ~~_or talking_~~ as they





did shopping. The two young men stopped to

buy some olives at a farmer’s booth that stood



beneath the branches of two old olive trees. As they stepped out into the

sunlight again, Dion turned to look up at the top of the high hill.


**Show Image 7A-2: Dion with Hiero admiring**
**Parthenon**

“Really, Hiero,” Dion asked, “is there a more

beautiful spectacle anywhere than the

Parthenon? ~~_The Parthenon was a temple_~~

~~_dedicated to the mythical goddess Athena._~~





My father and I traveled to many wonderful

places on our trading voyage around



the Mediterranean—but I never saw anything equal to it.” ~~_What is the_~~

~~_Mediterranean? [Have a student point to the Mediterranean Sea on Poster 1.]_~~

Hiero agreed as he looked up at the magnificent temple.

Lesson 7 Athens: The Birthplace of Democracy
**99**


Just as the city-state of Sparta focused on self-discipline and training for

battle, the Athenians focused on their love of art, beautiful **architecture,**

and sculpture. ~~_Architecture is the style in which buildings are designed. Is_~~

~~_the Parthenon an example of architecture or sculpture? (architecture)_~~ The

Athenians filled their remarkable city-state with graceful buildings that were

pleasing to the eye. Inside these buildings, and in the public spaces around

them, famous artists created statues for all to enjoy—statues that even

today are considered some of the finest ever made. ~~_Do you remember what_~~

~~_famous sculpture was created by Myron from Athens? [Point to Image Card 8_~~

~~_(The Discus Thrower, Myron’s statue) on the Civilization Chart.]_~~


The Athenians were wealthy enough to cover a forty-foot-high statue of Athena

in gold before setting it in the Parthenon. The ancient Greeks showed their

appreciation to Athena by visiting her statue and bringing gifts to remember

her wisdom and story of peace with the olive tree. ~~_What is appreciation? How_~~

~~_did the ancient Greeks show their appreciation to Athena?_~~


**Show Image 7A-3: Busy Athenian city-state**

At the same time that the arts were the glory

of Athens, ~~_or something that brought them_~~

~~_praise and that set them apart as unique,_~~

Athenian scientists were making discoveries

that would become the basis for modern





science. For example, one scientist you will

learn about was a great observer whose ideas

and classifications ~~_or names and categories_~~ are still used today. Other ancient

Greeks contributed inventions that the next civilizations developed more fully,

including the gear, screw, watermill, and catapult; plumbing; using furnaces to

melt and shape iron; and using air, water, or steam for central heating.


Athenian merchants such as Dion and his father were trading as far west

as present-day Britain and as far east as present-day India. ~~_[Point to these_~~

~~_locations on a world map or globe.] Remember, the ancient Greeks traveled_~~

~~_great distances by land and by sea in order to trade and explore._~~ These

merchants brought back goods and even more knowledge from distant lands.

This is another way that Athens differed from Sparta; as you heard earlier,

Sparta was a “closed” society, meaning that most of the people were not

allowed to travel outside of the city for trade or exploration.


At the heart of all these remarkable achievements was the Athenian belief

that human beings could **achieve** ~~_or successfully complete_~~ almost anything


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


they set their minds to, and in whatever they could not achieve, they could

at least fail with grand grace. ~~_If_~~ ~~grace~~ ~~_means a polite or nice way of behaving,_~~

~~_what do you think “failing with grand grace” means?_~~ It was this belief in the

benefit, or good, of independent thinking, or thinking for oneself, that led to

the greatest of all the Athenian gifts to the world—greater than the art, the

architecture, or the Olympic Games—the gift of **democracy.** ~~_Democracy is a_~~

~~_way of governing, or ruling, which gives the people the power to choose their_~~

~~_leaders and to help create their own laws._~~


**Show Image 7A-4: Pericles passing Hiero and**
**Dion**

As Hiero and Dion continued walking on that

sunny afternoon so long ago, they glanced

ahead and saw a face that they knew well. “It’s

Pericles [/paer* ə *klees/]!” Hiero exclaimed.





All Athenians knew the man whom they had

elected ~~_or chosen_~~ to run their government

year after year. Pericles held great power both as an army general and as the

leader of their government. However, like all Athenian leaders, he had to be

reelected ~~_or chosen again_~~ to his office every year, and if the Athenians did

not like the job he was doing, they could vote him out of office, or right out of

Athens for up to ten years!


**Show Image 7A-5: Athenian government**

It had not always been this way. In the past,

Athens had been ruled by a king. ~~_Under the_~~

~~_rule of a king, are the people allowed to help_~~

~~_create the laws or choose who rules them?_~~

~~_Which city-state that you learned about had_~~





~~_not only one king, but two?_~~ ~~(Sparta)~~ Then,

several nobles started to rule in place of the



king. ~~_Nobles were wealthy men who were related to the king._~~ Finally, a new

leader came along who thought every citizen should be able to take part in

his government.


Originally, only men who were born in Athens—and who were considered

wealthy enough—were allowed to be citizens. These citizens had the right to

vote, to be a part of a jury that made decisions in a court of law, and to serve

in the **assembly**, a large group of men who **debated** ~~_or discussed or argued_~~



Support


_Assembly_ can also mean
the way in which things
are put together.



Lesson 7 Athens: The Birthplace of Democracy
**101**


~~_their different points of view_~~ and created the laws. Over time, even poor

men—and some merchants who were not born in Athens but who lived and

traded there—were allowed to take part in the assembly.


However, because there were too many citizens (over 5,000!) participating

in this assembly, it became too difficult to manage the meetings and allow

everyone to have their say. Eventually, the Athenians decided to have some

citizens from each area come to the assembly to represent the people from

their area, so that the group could be smaller and easier to manage. Every

citizen still had the right to choose who would represent them in the smaller

assembly.


**Show Image 7A-6: Athenian women working**

**and managing the house**

Women, however, did not have the rights to do

any of these things, although they could own

land and have their own money. Athenian girls

also did not have the right to attend school





as the boys did. For Athenian women, it was

more important that they learn to cook, sew,



and clean. However, all well-educated young ladies learned at least enough

mathematics at home to be in charge of a household budget, ~~_or a plan for_~~

~~_how money will be spent at home_~~ and some who had learned reading and

writing at home were widely admired for their intelligence and learning.


Most Athenians knew that the best woman friend of Pericles, leader of the

Athenians, wrote many of his famous speeches for him. Yet she was not

permitted to listen to him speak those words in the assembly, nor to vote

for the laws he suggested. ~~_In the United States democracy today, are women_~~

~~_allowed to vote and take part in creating the laws?_~~ ~~(Yes.)~~ ~~_Have they always_~~

~~_been allowed to vote and take part in creating the laws?_~~ ~~(No.)~~


**Show Image 7A-7: Dion and Hiero watching**
**Pericles**

Seeing Pericles up ahead now, Dion asked

Hiero, “Who are those two men with him?”

Hiero peered above the heads of others in

the crowd. “Only one of the greatest writers





in the world, and the artist who designed the

statue of Athena!” Hiero answered. He smiled.


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government



**102**


“Only in Athens could you witness a conversation among the greatest living

political leader, a world-famous writer, and such a celebrated artist. Don’t

you wonder what those great men are talking about?”


“Whatever it is,” Dion responded, “I’m sure it is a most fascinating ~~_or_~~

~~_interesting_~~ conversation.”


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal** [Point to Image Card 11 (the Parthenon) on the Ancient Greek
Civilization Chart.] What structure did Dion describe as “the most beautiful
spectacle” in Athens? _(the Parthenon)_ What was the Parthenon? _(a temple_
_dedicated to the mythical goddess Athena)_

~~**ACTIVITIES**~~


**Image Review**

 - Show the images from any Read-Aloud again, and have students retell the
Read-Aloud using the images.


**Using a Map**


Materials: Poster 1; world map or globe

 - Ask a volunteer to point out the area of ancient Greece on a world map or
globe. Using Poster 1, review the geography of ancient Greece. Have students
point out the Black, Aegean, and Mediterranean Seas. Ask students why
these seas were so important to the ancient Greeks. Prompt them to recall
that they were used for fishing, trading, and exploring. Have a volunteer
point to the island of Crete, and ask students what job most Greeks had on
this island. Prompt them to recall the term _seafaring._ Remind students that
many different people doing different jobs is a component of a civilization.
Point to Athens and Sparta, and ask students what they recall about these
city-states. Point out Mount Olympus, and ask students why this mountain
was important to the ancient Greeks. Point to the sacred city of Olympia,
and ask students what important event happened there every four years,
and in whose honor this event was held. Prompt them to recall that the first
Olympic Games were held in honor of Zeus, the king of the mythical gods and
goddesses.


**Civilization Chart**


Materials: Ancient Greek Civilization Chart; drawing paper, drawing tools

 - Review the five components of the ancient Greek civilization that they have
learned about: jobs, city-states, leaders, religion, and contributions. Ask
students what they see in the images and what they remember about each
component. Have students form five groups. Assign one column to each
group, and have every group draw a picture and write a sentence about
the image(s) in their column. Allow the groups to share their drawings and
sentences with the class.


**Writing Prompts**

 - Students may be given an additional writing prompt such as the following:







How was life in Athens different from life in Sparta?



**110**




- What is democracy?


- How are the Olympic Games today different from the first Olympic
Games? How are they similar?


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


**Class Book: Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government**


Materials: Drawing paper, drawing tools

 - Tell the class or a group of students that they are going to make a class book
to help them remember what they have learned thus far in this unit. Have
students brainstorm important information about ancient Greece, the citystates of Sparta and Athens, the mythical Olympian gods and goddesses,
and the first Olympic Games. Have each student choose one idea to draw a
picture of, and ask each to write a caption for the picture. You may choose to
add more pages upon completion of the entire unit before binding the book.


**The Parthenon**


Materials: Image Cards 11 and 12

 - Have students look at Image Card 11 while they answer the following
questions:


   - What do you see? _(the Parthenon)_


   - Where is this building? _(on a high hill in Athens, Greece)_


   - When do you think this building was made? _(Answers may vary.)_ [Prompt
students to recall that the ancient Greek civilization existed more than two
thousand years ago.]


   - What was this building used for? _(It was a temple to the mythical goddess_
_Athena.)_


   - Where else have you seen a building with columns like these? [Show
students Image Card 12, and prompt them to recall the Lincoln Memorial
in Washington, D.C. Remind them that the Parthenon is a contribution to
the architecture, or design, of many of our buildings today.]


**Write Your Own Ode**


Materials: Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard

 - Remind students that Pindar was a famous Greek poet from Thebes. Share
that he wrote poems called odes that were sung at special occasions like
banquets and festivals, accompanied by music, instruments, and dancing.


 - Explain that an ode is a poem that admires something ordinary or shows the
importance of something that is usually overlooked. An ode does not have to
rhyme, but it should have detailed descriptions and observations. As either a
class or in small groups, have students write odes. To scaffold this activity for
students, use the following steps:


   - Brainstorm what you could write about. Think about things you see and
experience everyday that you don’t usually notice. Examples might include
chocolate, shoes, teachers, friends, flowers, sleep, books, love, school,
toothbrush, computers, etc.

   - Once you pick your topic, brainstorm why it is important. What does it do?
Why is it important? What would happen without it? How do you feel about
it? Put these details into parts or sections in your description.


   - Write your ode as a class or as a small group. Keep the lines short and use
as few words as possible.


   - Revise and rewrite, as time permits.


 - Here are some guidelines for odes:


   - Describe the subject using at least two different senses (touch, taste,
sight, sound, smell).


   - Show how much you admire the subject.


   - Use words and phrases more than sentences.


   - Explain the importance of your subject.


   - Have a clear rhythm.


**The Olive Tree**


Materials: Image Card 1; olives and olive oil

 - Show students Image Card 1, and ask them what they see. Ask students if
they have ever eaten an olive or had food cooked or prepared with olive oil.
Allow them to share what they have learned about the olive tree and its fruit.
You may wish to bring in a variety of olives or olive oil and bread (for dipping)
to sample.


**Note:** Be sure to follow your school’s policy regarding food distribution and
allergies.


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government



**112**


 - Prompt students to recall that the ancient Greeks grew olive trees in groves
as an important part of their farming and trade. Ask them to recall, according
to the ancient Greek legend, who the Athenians believed gave them the
gift of the olive tree. Remind students that the rugged terrain of Greece did
not make farming easy for the ancient Greeks, but that they were able to
grow olive trees in groves because these trees are hardy and able to grow in
difficult environments. Tell students that many groves of olive trees still grow
in Greece today.


**The Olive Branch**


Materials: Dollar bill

 - Show students a dollar bill, and ask them if they can see a type of plant on
it. Point out the olive branch, and explain that this branch symbolizes peace.
Ask students if they remember the legend about who gave the olive tree to
the people of ancient Greece. Remind them that, in this story, Athena told the
people of Athens that the olive tree would not only bring them abundance
as a food and through other uses, but that it would also become a symbol
of peace. Ask students why peace may be important to a civilization. Tell
students that today the saying “extend an olive branch” means to offer peace
to someone instead of continuing to fight.


**The Discus Thrower**


Materials: Flying disc

 - Show students Image 4A-7 of The Discus Thrower. Have them look at the
image while they answer the following questions:


   - What do you see? _(It is a statue called The Discus Thrower, and it was first_
_made by the sculptor Myron.)_


   - What is this figure doing? _(He is trying to throw a discus as far as possible._
_The discus was made of stone and took tremendous strength to throw.)_


   - Do you think he will throw the discus far? Why or why not? _(Answers_
_may vary.)_


   - When you throw something heavy, does your face look like this? _(Answers_
_may vary.)_ [Explain that the Greeks preferred to make humans look calm
and thoughtful; this was part of their idea of beauty.]


   - What would your body look like if you were throwing a ball or a flying disc?
_(Answers may vary.)_ [Have a few volunteers hold a flying disc and pose
like the athlete in the sculpture. Be sure to explain that the stone disc was
much heavier and was very difficult to throw.]

   - Do you think that the sculptor Myron accomplished his goal to capture the
look and feel of the athlete as he was throwing the disc? _(Answers may_
_vary.)_ [Explain that although this sculpture is accurate in pose, it is not
meant to be an exact portrait, because it does not show any strain in the
expression of the athlete. Explain that, instead, it is meant to capture an
ideal expression of the Olympic spirit.]


**Olympic Games**

 - You may wish to coordinate with the physical education teacher in your
school to set up a simple Olympics day for your class with contests
and prizes.


**Read and Spell: Word Sort Ending with** _**–ion**_


Materials: Activity Page PP.2

 - You may wish to challenge students and have them practice spelling and use
words with _–ion_ . It will be helpful to remind students that when this ending is
added to verbs, they become nouns. See teacher note in Lesson 3 on page 44
regarding the use of _–ion_, _–tion_, and _–sion_ and review as necessary. Students
can practice spelling words using different base words to use the appropriate
ending using Activity Page PP.2.


 - Encourage students to use a reference source like a digital or print dictionary
to help determine the meaning of unknown words.

to all the Greeks. ~~_Why do you think the Greeks_~~





~~_were afraid of the Persians?_~~ And now King Darius

had sent an army of Persian foot soldiers and



**122**



cavalry ~~_or soldiers on horseback_~~ to punish the Athenians. Darius was angry

that Athens had helped other Greek city-states fight against Persia. ~~_Why did_~~

~~_King Darius want to punish the Athenians? Remember, although the ancient_~~

~~_Greek city-states were mostly independent, they did help each other during_~~

~~_emergencies like invasions._~~ A fleet of six hundred ships had brought as many

as twenty thousand experienced Persian soldiers to a beach about twenty-six

miles from Athens, near a wide, flat plain called Marathon. ~~_[Point to Athens_~~

~~_and then Marathon on Poster 1, and reiterate that the distance between them_~~

~~_was about twenty-six miles.]_~~

general. “Besides, no one can beat Persian soldiers.”

Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


**Show Image 8A-2: Miltiades addressing the**
**generals and Callimachus**

But another Athenian general, a man named

Miltiades [/mil*t ie* ə *d eez/], ~~_[Point to the_~~

~~_man who is pointing to the map.]_~~ answered,

“The Persians fight for a king most of them

have never seen and who cares nothing for

them. We fight for our freedom and for the



freedom of our children. That must be worth something in battle.” ~~_Remember,_~~

~~_the Athenians came up with the idea for democratic rule._~~


Now, in those days, the Athenians had ten elected generals plus another

military leader called a polemarch [/poe*lee*mark/]. ~~_The polemarch was_~~

~~_not a general, but he represented the Athenian government during military_~~

~~_discussions._~~ Callimachus [/k ə *lim* ə *k ə s/], the polemarch, gathered along

with the ten generals including Miltiades to create a plan of defense. One of

the generals said, “The Plain of Marathon is a perfect place for the Persians

to attack us. There is room for their horsemen to move around us, and there

will be nowhere for us to go to **avoid** ~~_or keep away from_~~ their well-organized

soldiers fighting on foot.” ~~_A plain is a large, flat area of land, so the generals_~~

~~_knew the Persians can fit many horseman in this large, flat area._~~


Another general suggested, “Let us send our fastest runner to Sparta. The

Spartans are the greatest fighters in Greece. If they will help us, we might

have a chance.” ~~_What do you remember about the Spartans?_~~


But it was one hundred fifty miles from Athens to Sparta, and some of

the journey included rugged mountains and streams. ~~_[Show distance on_~~

~~_Poster 1.]_~~ The generals knew they would need a runner who was fast and

strong.


**Show Image 8A-3: Pheidippides beginning**

**his run**

“Pheidippides [/fie*dip* ə *dees/] is our man,”

the generals agreed. “No one in Athens can

touch him for speed over a long distance.” So

they sent swift-footed Pheidippides to call on





the Spartans for help. ~~_Why did the Athenian_~~

~~_generals send their fastest runner to Sparta?_~~



Lesson 8 Marathon
**123**


Then the generals called together all ten thousand Athenian men of fighting

age. In every Athenian home there were tearful goodbyes. At last, the

Athenians started off toward the Plain of Marathon, about twenty-six miles

away.


**Show Image 8A-4: Persians**

Meanwhile, the Persians were camped on the

beach near the edge of the plain. ~~_[Point to_~~

~~_the coastline at Marathon on Poster 1.]_~~ The

Persian commander-in-charge told his men,

“We will win such a great victory here for King





Darius that the rest of the Greeks will simply

surrender to us.”



**124**



The Persians were so confident, their commander took no special steps to

guard his camp other than sending the cavalry off on their horses to search

the area a few times a day. ~~_Why was the Persian army so confident they would_~~

~~_win the fight?_~~


**Show Image 8A-5: Pheidippides approaching**

**Spartan kings**

As all this was happening, the strong legs and

powerful heart of the Athenian messenger,

Pheidippides, carried him toward Sparta.

Pheidippides ran as he had never run before,

stopping only a few times to drink from

streams or rivers. He ran for almost three days

until he reached Sparta and the two Spartan kings. “You must come with your

armies at once, or it will be too late!” he explained. ~~_Can you imagine running_~~

~~_for almost three days?_~~


To his horror, the Spartan kings answered, “We cannot leave before

tomorrow. Sparta is in the middle of a religious holiday honoring the gods,

and our law says we must finish before we can leave to fight.” ~~_The Spartans_~~

~~_were celebrating a nine-day festival called Karneia to honor Apollo as the_~~

~~_protector of their cattle._~~


“By then the battle will be over, and we will have lost!” Pheidippides

exclaimed. He set out again to carry the news to the Athenians that they

would be on their own.


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


**Show Image 8A-6: Greek armies gathering;**

**Pheidippides talking with generals**

As it turned out, this was not true. As the

Athenians marched toward Marathon, a

thousand Greeks from another city, having

heard the news, joined them. Together, the

eleven thousand Greeks marched over the

mountains to the Plain of Marathon. As they



did so, Pheidippides arrived to say, “The Spartans cannot help us.” The

generals were horrified.


“The Persian army is much bigger than ours, with many more soldiers,” one

pointed out fearfully.


“We should surrender and ask for **forgiveness** !” cried a second. ~~_Forgiveness_~~

~~_is a decision to stop being angry or resentful._~~


“There will be no forgiveness,” said Miltiades, the general who had spoken

boldly ~~_or with courage_~~ back in Athens. “The Persians are here because we

helped other Greeks strike back against them. The Persians will not stop

until they have destroyed us.” ~~_Do you think the Athenians will surrender to the_~~

~~_Persians or fight for their freedom?_~~


**Show Image 8A-7: Generals voting; turning to**

**look at Callimachus**

The ten generals voted: Should they surrender,

or should they attack? Each side won five votes.


Then Miltiades remembered something:





Callimachus was allowed to vote, too. Miltiades

told him, “The decision rests with you. You will

decide whether we surrender and agree to



serve the Persians, suffering all that this will bring, or whether we will fight and

live as free people.” ~~_How do you think Callimachus will vote to break the tie?_~~


Callimachus trusted Miltiades. “What do you think?” he asked.


Miltiades answered, “If we do not fight, the people of Athens will be

frightened, too, and will surrender the city to the enemy. All of Greece will

follow. But if we attack before fear sweeps through our camp, I believe we

will win.”


Callimachus said, “Then let us fight!”


Lesson 8 Marathon
**125**


**Show Image 8A-8: Greeks attacking Persians**

Luck was with them. The Persian commander

had sent his cavalry off again to make sure

no other Greek armies were approaching.

While the horsemen were away, the Greeks

spread out in a wide line. The Greek generals

**purposely** ~~_or with deliberate planning_~~ put

more men at either end of their wide line,



leaving the middle ~~_[Point to the middle of the army in yellow.]_~~ as the weakest

part. Then, shouting a loud battle cry, the Greeks charged. ~~_Will this strategy_~~

~~_help the Athenians win or lose the battle?_~~


The Persians were startled. No one ever ran toward them. Nevertheless, they

moved forward toward the Greeks. “Look how weak those fools have left their

middle,” laughed the Persian leader. But the laugh was on him, for just as

the Greeks had planned, the Persians moved to the middle first and pushed

back the Greek line. But then the stronger Greek forces on the edges circled

around and attacked from the sides, catching the Persians between them.


**Show Image 8A-9: Greeks victorious;**

**Persians sailing away**

The Persians, confused and unable to defend

themselves, turned and ran for their ships

Greeks captured seven Persian ships before





the Persians could even reach them. The other

Persians sailed away.

“We have beaten the mighty Persians!” the Greeks told one another in

amazement ~~_or surprise._~~ Then they remembered their families waiting for

news at home.

volunteered, “I shall carry the news.” ~~_Who_~~

the scene of the battle at Marathon, and as

he reached the gates of Athens, the people

out one word: “Victory!” Then his great heart—which had carried him to Sparta

and back—finally gave out. Pheidippides fell dead at the gates of Athens.

In **tribute** to Pheidippides, the Greeks

measured the distance he had run from

Marathon to Athens, ~~_[Point to Athens and then_~~

~~_Marathon on Poster 1.]_~~ and those twenty-six





miles became the distance of their long
distance races. ~~_From what you have read, what_~~



~~_do you think the word tribute means? What clues did you use to figure it out?_~~

~~_A tribute is a gift, compliment, or action that is given to honor or remember_~~

~~_the contribution(s) of a particular person or group. Why did the Greeks want_~~

~~_to pay tribute to Pheidippides?_~~


And this is why today we call a long-distance race a **marathon** —in memory

of Pheidippides and all those who fought for freedom on the plains of

Marathon. ~~_Today the word_~~ ~~marathon~~ ~~_can mean a twenty-six-mile race, or any_~~

~~_long-distance race or endurance contest._~~

1. **Inferential** Why did King Darius of Persia purposely send an army of soldiers
to Marathon, about twenty-six miles from Athens? _(The king was upset that_
_the Athenians had helped other Greek city-states fight against Persia.)_


2. **Inferential** How did the Greek leaders decide whether they would fight or
surrender Athens to the Persians? _(They took a vote, and Callimachus was_
_the tie-breaker who decided they would fight.)_


3. **Inferential** Why did the Athenian generals send Pheidippides to Sparta?
_(They needed to get word to Sparta as soon as possible to ask for their_
_military help in fighting the Persians, and Pheidippides was their fastest_
_runner.)_


4. **Inferential** How did the Greeks win, despite their smaller size and without
the help of the Spartans? _(The Greeks purposely tricked the Persians into_
_attacking their middle, and then surrounded them from the sides and drove_
_them away.)_

~~**WORD WORK: TRIBUTE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “In tribute to Pheidippides, the Greeks
measured the distance he had run from Marathon to Athens, and those
twenty-six miles became the distance of their long-distance races.”


2. Say the word _tribute_ with me.


3. A tribute is a gift, compliment, or action that is given to honor the
contribution(s) of a particular person or group.


4. Marathon races were named as a tribute to Pheidippides’s twenty-six-mile
run and his role in the Battle at Marathon.


5. Can you think of a person you would like to give a tribute to? Try to use the
word _tribute_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase students’ responses: “I would like to give a tribute to
because . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Brainstorming activity for follow-up.** [Write the word _tribute_ in an
oval on chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard.] What words come to
mind when you hear the word _tribute_ ? [Write students’ words on spokes
coming out from the oval. If necessary, guide students with words like
_respect, honor, compliment, gift, statue, memorial,_ etc.] Why do you think
receiving a tribute from someone would be a memorable experience?
Remember to answer in complete sentences and be sure to begin your
response with “I think receiving a tribute from someone would be a
memorable experience because . . .”

on the Plains of Marathon. Use the following questions to review story
elements and discuss why this battle began and what the final outcome was
between the Persian and Greek armies:


    - Why did King Darius of Persia purposely send an army of soldiers to
Marathon, about twenty-six miles from Athens? _(The king was upset that_
_the Athenians had helped other Greek city-states fight against Persia.)_


    - Why did the Athenian generals send Pheidippides to Sparta? _(They needed_

Persia would attack Greece again. “This time,” he thought, “Persia will have

so many soldiers and ships that it will not fail.” ~~_Why do you think King Xerxes_~~
~~_wanted Persia to fight the Greeks again?_~~


Xerxes gathered tens of thousands of soldiers, led by his finest troops.

Even Xerxes, however, did not have enough ships to carry that many men

to Greece by sea. “We will go over land from Asia and down into Greece,” he

commanded.

**Show Image 9A-2: Persians crossing giant**
**ship bridge**

~~_[Show Poster 2 (Battle of Thermopylae), and_~~
~~_point to the Persians’ first route, marked in_~~

~~_purple.]_~~ This meant that the Persians would

have to cross a mile-wide **channel** of water



that lay between Asia and northern Greece. ~~_A_~~
~~_channel is a sailable route between two bodies_~~
~~_of water. The Persians had to cross the channel_~~
~~_of Hellespont to travel by land to Greece. The word_~~ ~~channel~~ ~~_can also refer to_~~

~~_a television station._~~ Xerxes told his navy captains, “We will cross the channel

on an enormous floating bridge. Spread out your ships in rows, and tie them

together. Then lay wooden platforms across the space between the ships

over which my army can pass.” ~~_[Point to how the ships are connected by_~~

~~_platforms to make a giant ship bridge.]_~~


Xerxes’s vast army succeeded in crossing the decks of six hundred ships

and moved into Greece. There they faced another difficulty: Greece’s high

mountains. To avoid having to travel over these mountains, Xerxes led his

army south along a narrow strip of dry land near the eastern coast of Greece

called Thermopylae [/ther*mop* ə *lee/]. ~~_[Show again on Poster 2 the route_~~
~~_marked in purple that the Persians took from the Hellespont to Thermopylae,_~~

~~_and point to the mountains.]_~~ At the other end of this narrow pass, the Greeks

were waiting for him. The Greeks knew that Xerxes’s army could not spread

out to its full width to attack here, for there simply was not enough room

in the narrow pass between the mountains and the ocean. Instead, here a

smaller army might have a chance to win. ~~_Which is the smaller army—the_~~

~~_Persians or the Greeks?_~~


**Show Image 9A-3: Leonidas at the head of**

always in their minds, Leonidas and his soldiers waited.

Here _draw_ means to

**Show Image 9A-4: Themistocles leading the**
**Greek navy**

Leonidas knew that, farther south, an

Athenian leader named Themistocles

[/ th ə *mis*t ə *kleez/] was rushing to draw

together a fleet of navy ships.


Themistocles was sure that the war would

be won at sea, for as he had told the other

Greeks, “The Persians may force their way into Greece, but Xerxes cannot

keep bringing food and other supplies to his men here by land. It takes too

long. So if we control the sea, the Persians will eventually have to go home.”

~~_Do you think this strategy will work?_~~ Leonidas and his Spartan soldiers had

to hold Xerxes at Thermopylae long enough for the Athenian fleet to get into

position. ~~_Are the Greek city-states working together during this emergency?_~~


**Show Image 9A-5: Persian and Greek armies**
**meeting at the narrow pass**

Soon the Persians reached the place where

the Greeks blocked the pass. Xerxes sent

a message to the Greeks warning them to

surrender and ask for forgiveness. He wrote,





“I command so many archers that their attack

of arrows will block out the sun above you.”



**140**



~~_Archers shoot arrows with a bow, like the mythical hunting goddess Artemis._~~


To this, one of the Spartans jokingly answered, “Fine, we **prefer** to fight in the

shade anyway.” ~~_What do you think this word means? What clues did you use_~~

~~_to figure it out?_~~ ~~Prefer~~ ~~_means to like something better than something else._~~
~~_Did the Greeks really prefer to fight in the shade? Why do you think they said_~~

~~_this?_~~


After waiting for four days for the Greeks to surrender, the furious King

Xerxes gave word for his Persian armies to attack. However, just as the

Greeks had predicted, only a small number of Persian soldiers could fit into

the narrow pass at once, so their great numbers did not help them. Leonidas

and the Greeks drove back one attack after another. Then one of the Persian

officers said to Xerxes, “O great king, a Greek who lives near here offers to

lead us to the Greeks through another pass in the mountains, if you will pay

him enough gold.”


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


Xerxes smiled grimly. “Good! Have him lead half our men along this other

path, so that we can come out behind the Greeks.” ~~_[On Poster 2, point to_~~
~~_the second Persian route marked in red that went through a pass in the_~~

~~_mountains.]_~~


**Show Image 9A-6: Leonidas telling other**
**Greeks they will stay**

The Persians began to move back so they

could take the other route. But Leonidas of

Sparta saw what was happening. Quickly

meeting with the other Greek leaders, he





commanded, “Take your men safely away from

here. I will remain behind with three hundred



of my best Spartan fighters, and will force the Persians to take the other,

longer way around.” ~~_Why did Leonidas and his men decide to stay behind?_~~ ~~(to~~

~~hold the Persians back)~~


“But this is very dangerous for you and your three hundred men,” another

officer protested. “Once the Persians come through the other pass, they will

circle around and attack you from behind. You will be caught between the two

Persian forces.”


Leonidas turned to one of his Spartan officers. “What do you think?”


His friend shrugged. “We are Spartans,” he said, and that was all. It was

enough.


Leonidas told the other Greeks, “There is your answer. We will stay.” ~~_What do_~~
~~_the words “We are Spartans” mean to you? Do you think the Spartans were_~~
~~_brave for staying?_~~


**Show Image 9A-7: Three hundred Spartans**
**standing against thousands of Persians**

So the rest of the Greek army quickly retreated

out of the narrow pass as the three hundred

Spartans spread out across the area. When

they were in position, Leonidas told them, “Let





us fight in such a way that forever after, all

Persians will speak of us in amazement and all

Greeks in words of pride.”



Lesson 9 Thermopylae: The Persians Strike Again
**141**


Together, the Spartans bravely fought as long as they could, but in the end,

the Persians defeated the Spartans and continued on. Leonidas and his

three hundred Spartans are still remembered more than two thousand years

later for their heroism ~~_or bravery_~~ for fighting against such a large army.

These Greeks were able to hold the Persians at the pass long enough for the

other Greek forces to prepare for battle. This famous act of courage by the

Spartans became known as “the last stand at Thermopylae.” ~~_[On Poster 2,_~~

remember and would like to review.







Why did King Xerxes decide to attack Greece? _(He was angry_
_because the Greeks had defeated his father previously during the_
_Battle of Marathon.)_




- How did King Xerxes transport tens of thousands of troops into
Greece? _(by creating a floating bridge, using wooden platforms_
_across the spaces and decks of six hundred ships anchored side-_
_by-side)_


- What was “the last stand at Thermopylae?” _(a famous act of_
_courage by the Spartans; they held back the Persians so the Greek_
_forces could prepare for battle)_


**Show Image 9A-8: Greek navy battling the**
**Persian navy**

Soon the Persians continued south and

reached Athens. ~~_[On Poster 2, point to the city-_~~

~~_state of Athens.]_~~ To their shock, they found the

city nearly **deserted** ~~_or empty and abandoned_~~ .





Meanwhile, Themistocles, the Athenian navy

commander, had moved all of the Greeks to



**142**



nearby areas, including an island called Salamis [/sal*m ə s/]. ~~_[On Poster 2,_~~

~~_point to the island of Salamis.]_~~ When Xerxes realized this, he sent for his navy


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


from Persia. “Sail over here and attack Salamis!” he ordered. ~~_[On Poster 2,_~~
~~_point to the third Persian route marked in white from Persia to Salamis.] The_~~
~~_Persians took a long time to arrive in their ships, and they had to sail close to_~~

~~_land so they could stop at different cities on the way for supplies._~~


But this was exactly what the clever Themistocles had counted on. He had

hidden the Greek navy in the bays and harbors that lay between Salamis and

Athens on the Greek mainland. ~~_[On Poster 2, show the Greek forces marked_~~
~~_in red near the island of Salamis.] What do you think is going to happen? Who_~~

~~_do you think will win, the Persians or the Athenians?_~~ As in the mountain pass

at Thermopylae, the greater Persian numbers could not help Xerxes in this

narrow neck of water. When the Persian ships approached, Themistocles

signaled to his ships’ captains, “Attack!” From their hiding places, the

smaller, faster Greek ships surprised the Persians. The larger Persian ships,

jammed together in the narrow waters, could not turn around to defend

themselves. Using metal battering rams attached to the bow ~~_or front_~~ of their

ships, the Greeks smashed into the helpless Persian ships. One after another,

the Persian vessels sank. Those few that did not sink sailed away broken and

battered.


**Show Image 9A-9: Victorious Greeks,**
**Persians retreating**

The Greek victory at Salamis was complete.

King Xerxes realized, “We cannot stay here if

we cannot count on our ships to bring us food,

medicine, and more soldiers from Persia.”





Finally, the Persians left Greece. ~~_[Point to the_~~
~~_ships sailing away in the image.] Is this what_~~



~~_you thought would happen?_~~


There would be only one more land battle the following year, which was won

by the Greeks; but nothing compared to the heroic stand by the Greeks at

Marathon, Thermopylae, and Salamis. Finally, the Persian threat was over

forever, and the stories of these Greek victories would be told again and

again for years to come.

**Show Poster 2: Battle of Thermopylae**


1. **Evaluative** Were your predictions about whether the outcome would be the
same or different correct? Why or why not? _(Answers may vary.)_


2. **Inferential** Why did King Xerxes decide to attack Greece? _(He was angry_
_because the Greeks had defeated his father previously during the Battle of_
_Marathon.)_


3. **Literal** How did King Xerxes transport tens of thousands of troops into
Greece? _(He did this by creating a floating bridge, using wooden platforms_
_across the spaces and decks of six hundred ships anchored side-by-side.)_


4. **Inferential** How did the Greeks defeat the much larger Persian army?
_(Again, the Greeks used strategy; they fought the smaller number of Persians_
_at the narrow pass of Thermopylae and held them there while the other Greek_
_forces prepared; they then attacked the Persians near Salamis with their_
_ships.)_


5. **Inferential** What does Sparta’s stand at Thermopylae tell us about the
Spartans? _(Answers may vary but may include that they were brave and did_
_what needed to be done for their city-state and for Greece.)_


6. **Evaluative** _Where? Think-Pair-Share:_ Asking questions after a Read-Aloud is
one way to see how much everyone has learned. Think of a question you can
ask your neighbor about the Read-Aloud that starts with the word _where._ Use
the poster to help you think of a place to ask a question about. For example,
you could ask, “Where did the last stand of three hundred Spartans take
place?” _(Thermopylae)_ Turn to your neighbor and ask your _where_ question.
Listen to your neighbor’s response. Then your neighbor will ask a new _where_
question, and you will get a chance to respond. I will call on several of you to
share your questions with the class.

rephrase the students’ responses: “I prefer rather than .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Sharing activity for follow-up.** Think of some things you prefer over
others. Keep in mind that everyone has different ideas about the things they
prefer, and that may determine why you would select one thing over another
and why your answer might be different from someone else’s. Remember to

**Note to Teacher**







Proverbs are short, traditional sayings that have been passed along orally
from generation to generation. These sayings usually express general truths
based on experiences and observations of everyday life. Although some
proverbs do have literal meanings—that is, they mean exactly what they
say—many proverbs have a richer meaning beyond the literal level. It is
important to help students understand the difference between the literal
meaning of the words and their implied or figurative meaning.

**Universal Access**

 - The concept of _philosophy_ may be difficult for students. Throughout the day,
point out when students do something philosophical (e.g., showing curiosity
by asking questions, observing, thinking about a hard question). Tell students
that at those moments they are practicing philosophy. You might also model
philosophizing by voicing a thought sequence such as, “I wonder why we
have recess every day? Maybe it is so we can go outside and exercise and
we do that because it helps us concentrate harder when we come back in to
learn.”


 - Invite a professor of philosophy to speak with your class about what they do
and think about that makes them philosophers.

He was the most famous **philosopher** who

ever lived. ~~_What is a philosopher?_~~ ~~(someone~~

~~who studies life, knowledge, and truth)~~ His

name was Socrates [/sok*r ə *teez/], and

he lived in the city-state of Athens over two





thousand years ago. ~~_[Point to the older man in_~~

~~_the image.] Let’s say this philosopher’s name_~~



**154**



~~_together: Socrates. [Show Athens on Poster 1.] He lived in Athens. What do we_~~

~~_know about Athens?_~~


The stories about Socrates describe him as the most down-to-earth fellow

you could ever meet. ~~_If someone is down-to-earth, he is realistic, honest,_~~

~~_and straightforward._~~ These stories, written by his friends and students, tell

us all we know about him, for Socrates never wrote anything down himself.

According to these stories, there was no one more clever, no one more loyal

to his friends, no one so willing to poke fun at himself, and no one as glad to

share everyday activities with other people.

Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


But the one thing that made Socrates such a great philosopher was that he

kept asking questions about why people did such everyday things. ~~_Do you_~~

~~_think asking questions is a great way to learn about things?_~~


In the stories about Socrates, we hear about him sitting beneath a shady

tree, or walking with friends—always engaged in curious conversation.


**Show Image 10A-2: Wealthy Athenians**

**conversing at dinner party**

In one story, many guests are waiting for him

to arrive at a dinner party. The guests and their

host, a man named Agathon [/ag* ə *thon/],

are wealthy, well-educated, young Athenians

who talk about sports, politics, and the latest

plays. Some help run their family’s large

farms or travel to faraway lands on business trips as merchants. Some are

political leaders in Athens. A few are soldiers. None of them, however, spend

their lives like Socrates, just thinking and asking questions to answer other

questions.


In this story, Socrates is older than the rest of the guests at this party, has

almost no money to his name, wears the same outfit day and night, and

generally walks about without shoes. Yet in this and other stories, we hear

politicians, landowners, and soldiers speak of him with great **affection** ~~_or_~~

~~_liking_~~ and respect.


**Show Image 10A-3: Socrates with wealthy**

**Athenian in the market**

At the dinner party, one Athenian says, “One

day, Socrates and I were passing through

the marketplace. I bought a number of items

for myself, and knowing Socrates has little





money, I offered to buy him whatever he

wanted. Socrates said, ‘One reason for human



unhappiness is that people always want more things than they need. When

they get those things, they still want more. I think the happiest people are the

ones with the least number of things. Just look at all the **marvelous** things

in this marketplace that I don’t want!’” ~~_Why doesn’t Socrates want any of_~~

~~_the marvelous, or wonderful, things from the marketplace? What does this_~~

~~_Athenian’s story tell us about the kind of person Socrates was?_~~


Lesson 10 The Great Thinkers of Greece
**155**


**Show Image 10A-4: Socrates as a soldier**

Another dinner guest shares a very different

memory of Socrates. “During the war, when we

were soldiers together in that icy, cold winter,

everyone else bundled up in as many clothes

as possible. But Socrates gave another man

his coat and boots saying, ‘You need these

more than I do.’ He marched barefoot, even



over the ice, yet he out-marched the rest of us. And when we ran low on

food, he still shared his food with others. Yet during the battle, he was the

strongest of us all.” ~~_Why was Socrates such a strong soldier? Do you think his_~~

~~_philosophy helped Socrates to be a stronger person?_~~


“And though I received honors for bravery that day, Socrates was the real

hero. Yes, I led the charge, but I became surrounded by enemy soldiers. Just

as one of them knocked my sword from my hand, Socrates burst through

them, scattering them left and right. Then he glared at them so fiercely, they

ran away. He found me another sword and then said, ‘If I had known that

making ugly faces could drive the enemy away, I could have won the battle

for us—for heaven knows I am ugly enough for that.’” ~~_Does it sound like_~~

~~_Socrates had a sense of humor?_~~


**Show Image 10A-5: Socrates arriving at**

**dinner party**

As the guest finishes this retelling, Socrates

himself finally arrives for the party. Agathon,

the host, insists, “Sit next to me, Socrates, so I

can hear your words of wisdom.”





**156**



Socrates laughs, “I fear you’ll go thirsty,

Agathon, for I have no wisdom for you to

hear. I have only questions, not answers.” ~~_Why did Socrates say he only had_~~

~~_questions? Do you think a great philosopher can have answers, too?_~~


In all of the stories about Socrates, we read that his method of learning and

teaching was to ask others questions like “How do you know?” and “What

do you mean?” For example, someone might say to him, “The way to lead a

good life is to give to others,” to which Socrates might respond, “How do you

know?”


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


**Show Image 10A-6: Socrates asking**

**questions**

By asking these questions, Socrates really

wanted to cause people to think about

their lives and why they do certain things.

“Otherwise,” he would say, “we will just repeat

the same old mistakes everyone else has

made. And when we end up doing good things,



shouldn’t we try to understand why they are good so that we can do more

good things?”


Somehow it was always in his company that people had moments of

enlightenment. ~~_What is enlightenment?_~~ ~~(Enlightenment~~ ~~means the act of~~

~~being aware of problems or concerns.)~~


Of course, some people did not like Socrates. They said he was wasting their

time or confusing them by trying to change their minds. Socrates protested,

“But I cannot change your mind. Only you can do that.” Then he would go on

his way.


**Show Image 10A-7: Plato learning from**

**Socrates; taking notes**

Many of Socrates’s friends went on to become

great leaders of Greece, and many of his

students became widely known and respected.

One such student was an intelligent young





fellow named Plato [/plae*toe/]. ~~_[Point to the_~~

~~_man seated with a paper and writing tool, and_~~



~~_ask students to repeat his name.]_~~ Poet, champion athlete, and brave soldier,

Plato paid close attention to what Socrates said. Later in his life, Plato wrote

books reporting those wonderful discussions. But as years passed and

Plato became famous himself, he wrote more about his own ideas about the

world and less about Socrates. ~~_So did Plato also become a philosopher like_~~

~~_Socrates?_~~ ~~(yes)~~


Lesson 10 The Great Thinkers of Greece
**157**


**Show Image 10A-8: Plato’s academy in olive**

**grove**

Finally, Plato opened a school near a grove

of olive trees called “the Grove of Academe”

[/ ak* ə *deem/]. The school became famous

as “The Academy,” a word we still use today

for some schools. Here, Plato offered classes

in all sorts of subjects: history, mathematics,



Support

also mean to proofread

**158**



music, literature, law, politics, and more. He would always ask: “What do we

know about these things? How can we be sure we are correct? How can our

knowing lead to greater happiness?” ~~_Do you remember who else asked these_~~

~~_same types of questions?_~~ ~~(Socrates)~~


But by the time Plato taught at The Academy, Athens had changed. It had

gone through a long, terrible war. A terrible disease had swept through the

city, a disease that today we might be able to treat with modern medicine.

Without such medicine, many Athenians died from this illness. Many of the

happy young men and women of Plato’s youth did not survive. Life was no

longer so easy or happy for him. He then began writing books that asked

questions like, “Wouldn’t life be nicer if we could only . . . ?” and continued

to try to find **proof** to back up his ideas. ~~Proof~~ ~~_means evidence or facts that_~~

~~_support that something is true._~~


**Show Image 10A-9: Aristotle**

Among Plato’s students was a young man

named Aristotle [/aer* ə *stot* ə l/]. ~~_[Point to_~~

~~_the man in the image, and ask students to_~~

~~_repeat his name.]_~~ Aristotle, too, wanted to

understand people and things, but he looked





at them in a way more like Socrates than Plato.

Aristotle thought, “Instead of looking for facts



to prove what we already think is true, let us first study the facts and then try

to understand what they mean.” ~~_So Aristotle studied the facts, or things he_~~

~~_knew were true, and tried to find out more about them._~~


That simple idea would change the world. Aristotle would become the first

great observer, studying things he could see and experiment with, such as

plants, animals, human beings, and the stars and planets. ~~_What is Aristotle_~~

~~_observing in this image?_~~ Aristotle’s ideas and classifications are still used in

science today.


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


Aristotle also believed in the importance of having balance in life. He thought

doing or having too much of one thing—such as staying up too late, eating

too many unhealthy foods, or even studying too much—did not allow time

for other things you may need to do. ~~_So Aristotle thought that too much of_~~

~~_anything wasn’t good, and that it was important to have a balance of different_~~

~~_things._~~


Aristotle, like his teacher, Plato, also opened a school in Athens. Aristotle’s

students, and the books he wrote, spread across Greece and beyond,

carrying Greek ideas to distant lands. ~~_So Aristotle became a philosopher like_~~

~~_his teacher, Plato, before him, and his teacher’s teacher, Socrates, before that._~~

Among Aristotle’s students was an **astonishing** ~~_or surprisingly amazing_~~ boy

who would carry these ideas the farthest of all. His name was Alexander, and

you will learn about him in the next Read-Aloud.


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN).**~~


1. **Literal** What is a philosopher? _(someone who studies life, knowledge, and_
_truth)_


2. **Evaluative** What method of learning did Socrates use? _(He believed in_
_asking questions but never gave answers; he believed people should discover_
_their own truth and the reasons why they did certain things.)_ What are some
questions you could ask to learn more about people and the world around
you? _(Answers may vary.)_


3. **Inferential** How are Aristotle’s studies important to science today?
_(Scientists use Aristotle’s studies and classifications of many different types_
_of plants and animals in their studies today.)_


4. **Inferential** These philosophers lived in the city-state Athens. Why were
philosophers more likely to be found in Athens than in Sparta? _(Sparta was_
_focused on military power, but Athens was focused on independent thinking.)_

~~**SAYINGS AND PHRASES: PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH (5 MIN.)**~~


**Practice What You Preach**

  - Ask students if they have ever heard anyone say “practice what you preach.”


  - Have students repeat the proverb.


  - Ask them what they think this proverb means. Explain that the literal
meaning of this proverb is that you should behave or live your life in the same
way that you tell others they should act.


  - Tell students that one of the Greek philosophers they have learned about in
today’s Read-Aloud is an example of this saying.

    - Which philosopher is an example of this saying and why? _(Socrates was a_
_philosopher who said that one reason for human unhappiness is that people_
_wanted more things than they needed. Remind students how Socrates_
_practiced what he preached when he gave his boots away to the soldier,_
_wore the same clothes every day, and did not get anything for himself at the_
_marketplace, even when his friend offered to pay for it.)_


  - Discuss what students think about the saying.

    - Do you think it is easy or hard to “practice what you preach.” Do you think
it’s important? Why?


  - Expand upon their responses with more complex vocabulary. Look for more
opportunities to use this saying in your classroom.


~~**PLAN A FICTIONAL NARRATIVE (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that they are going to write a narrative paragraph.


  - Explain that a narrative is a story. For example, the stories they heard about
Hermes being a messenger and Lysander going away to battle camp at age
seven are narratives.


  - Remind students that a narrative, or story, has the following elements:

    - characters

    - setting

    - plot

- Explain that their narratives might be much shorter than the ones they have
heard because they are still learning the writing process.


- Tell students that their narrative, or story, should tell about someone living in
the time of ancient Greece.


- On chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard, brainstorm together about
all of the different kinds of people who would have lived during this time.
_(child or adult; male or female; warrior in the Spartan army; Olympic athlete_
_or observer; merchant; seafarer from Crete; citizen or leader in the Athenian_
_assembly; philosopher; sculptor; poet; etc.)_ Have students think about what
each character might do every day. _(goes to school; has a job; stays at home;_
_trains in a military camp; travels; fishes; creates art; etc.)_


- Have students take out Activity Page 10.1. Tell each student to choose a
character from the list and write it in the center oval. On the surrounding
spokes, tell students to write words and phrases about the character—what
they do every day, the view from where they live, the sounds they might hear,
etc. Remind students that when they brainstorm, they do not need to write in
complete sentences, but instead they should write down whatever comes to
mind about the topic. Tell students to try to fill all six spokes with information
about their characters.


Check for Understanding


Circulate to check that students have identified a plausible
character from ancient Greece and have written a few facts about
him/her.


- Once students have written down everything they can think of about
the chosen character, tell them that they will draft, or write, this fictional
narrative the next time you meet.


- If students finish early, they may draw an illustration of what their story
will be about on the back of Activity Page 10.1 as an additional step in the
planning process.


- Collect Activity Page 10.1 to evaluate and provide constructive feedback
to students. Check that students have chosen a character and have listed
accurate details about ancient Greece.

**Show Image 11A-1: King Philip looking at map;**
**Alexander playing**

To the north of the Greek city-states and of Mount

Olympus lay the territory known as Macedonia [/

mas* ə *doe*nee* ə /]. ~~_[Show Macedonia on Poster 1.]_~~

~~_At this time, Macedonia was not a part of ancient_~~

~~_Greece._~~ The Macedonian king, Philip the Second,

watched and waited as the Greek city-states struggled among themselves

for power and wealth after the Persian wars. It seemed that they could work

together brilliantly when they faced a common enemy such as Persia, but

afterward they would go back to competing against one another. Away from all

these conflicts, King Philip grew stronger. ~~_What are conflicts? What does King_~~

~~_Philip notice about the Greek city-states?_~~ ~~(They work together when they face~~

~~a common enemy, but then they go back to competing against one another.)~~


King Philip of Macedonia had a plan: he would let the rest of the Greeks wear

themselves out fighting one another, and then he would lead his army south

to unite all of Greece under his command. ~~_What was King Philip’s plan?_~~ ~~(to let~~

~~the Greeks wear themselves out by fighting with each other)~~ ~~_Do you think it_~~

~~_will work?_~~


Philip also had a son whom he expected to follow in his steps and take over

the throne one day. The boy was a bold, handsome, curly-haired youngster

named Alexander. At first, Philip was a bit disappointed when it became clear

that Alexander would not grow up to be a tall, strapping ~~_or powerful_~~ fellow

like his father. Philip wondered, “How can someone Alexander’s size become

a great warrior and commander like . . . well, like me?” He soon realized that

he had nothing to worry about. ~~_What hint does this sentence give of what is_~~

~~_going to happen?_~~ ~~(Alexander will become a great warrior and commander~~

~~like his father.)~~


**Show Image 11A-2: Young Alexander training**
**to fight**

Alexander was determined to be the best at

everything he did. He constantly practiced

with sword and spear, hour after hour. Even

full-grown soldiers told one another, “Keep

your guard up when you practice against

Prince Alexander, or you will find his sword

pointed at you!” Alexander trained himself to swim in icy rivers and run for

miles without stopping. He became an excellent wrestler and a champion

horseman, and was constantly challenging other riders. ~~_Do you think all of_~~

~~_Alexander’s practice helped him succeed?_~~


But Alexander was more than strong and sturdy. He was intelligent, too.

Realizing this, Philip told his son, “I have arranged to have the greatest

thinker in the world come here to teach you. He is the famous Aristotle. Treat

him with respect.” ~~_Who was Aristotle?_~~ ~~(famous philosopher)~~ ~~_Why do you think_~~

~~_King Philip wanted his son to study with him?_~~


**Show Image 11A-3: Alexander learning from**
**Aristotle**

Alexander came to love and honor the wise

Aristotle, and tried to learn all that he could

from him. Pleased with his student, Aristotle

taught the prince more than science and

mathematics. He also tried to pass along all

that the Greeks, especially the Athenians,

had learned about leading a civilized and well-balanced life. ~~_Was living a_~~

~~_well-balanced life important to Aristotle?_~~ ~~(yes)~~ Alexander loved to study the

poems of Pindar.


Alexander listened when Aristotle taught him the importance of observing

and studying facts before making decisions. ~~_Do you remember another_~~


Lesson 11 Alexander the Great, Part I
**169**


~~_famous philosopher who shared this idea?_~~ ~~(Plato)~~ However, the prince’s

energetic nature caused him to use this lesson in ways far different from

those that the quiet scientist had imagined.


**Show Image 11A-4: Alexander observing the**

**wild Bucephalus**

One famous example occurred when

Alexander was in his early teens and set

his eyes on a magnificent horse named





Bucephalus [/bue*sef* ə *l ə s/]. ~~_If the horse_~~

~~_was magnificent, was it ordinary or grand?_~~

Alexander told his father’s groomsmen, “That



**170**



is the horse I want to ride.”


The head groomsman bowed. “I am sorry, your highness, I cannot let

you—for your own safety. No one can ride Bucephalus. One of our greatest

horsemen tried yesterday, and even he broke his leg.” ~~_Based on what you_~~

~~_know about Alexander, do you think he will ride this magnificent horse?_~~


Alexander realized he would have to use his mind as well as his muscles to

**tame** the horse. ~~Tame~~ ~~_means to train and make gentle._~~ “I must think this

through,” he told himself. He watched as one rider after another led the huge

horse out to the wooden fence and tried to mount the saddle. Alexander

noticed something no one else had seen. The prince realized, “Why, the big

fellow is frightened each time he sees his own shadow moving before him on

the ground. He becomes so nervous that he throws off anyone who tries to

ride him.”


**Show Image 11A-5: Alexander riding a calmed**

**Bucephalus**

Alexander took some sugar out to the horse.

“Here, boy, eat this,” he said, and he turned

Bucephalus around in the other direction

so that he was facing the sun and could

not see his own shadow. Then Alexander

easily climbed into the saddle. Everyone

was amazed. Alexander rode the huge horse all afternoon. Even King Philip

came out to watch, grinning at his son. “He’s not so bad!” called Alexander,

grinning back. Finally, Bucephalus trusted Alexander so much that the

boy could lead him to do anything—even with his shadow in front of him.


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


~~_[Point to the shadow in the image]_~~ Bucephalus became Alexander’s horse,

and Alexander so loved the horse that later he named a city after him. ~~_How_~~
~~_did Alexander tame the horse that no one else could tame? Did he use his_~~

~~_strength or did he use his intelligence?_~~


**Show Image 11A-6: Alexander riding at the**

**front of his army**

Soon Alexander was leading troops into battle

for his father. He developed a habit that stayed

with him all his life: he always rode in the front

line of fighters. The soldiers were proud of





their brave prince and loved him for taking

risks as great as those he asked them to take.



A number of times when a battle might have been lost, Alexander would yell,

“Charge!” and ride ahead. His **devoted** ~~_or loyal and committed_~~ soldiers would

think, “We cannot let him be killed or captured!” They had no choice but to

follow him and win the battle, for they knew Alexander would never **retreat** .
~~Retreat~~ ~~_means to withdraw or go back. Why do you think Alexander would_~~

~~_never retreat?_~~


At last King Philip felt that he and his son were ready to conquer the Greeks

who were south of Macedonia. Then, by a stroke of good luck, they found a

better way. Their old foe, ~~_or enemy_~~ Persia, once again came after the Greek

cities. Philip told the other leaders of Greece, “I will lead you against Persia.”

A few protested, but Philip and Alexander quickly invaded their cities and

conquered them by force. People in the other city-states, weakened by war,

were afraid to go up against the powerful Macedonian army. ~~_So, did King_~~

~~_Philip get what he wanted?_~~ ~~(yes)~~


**Show Image 11A-7: Alexander as king at the**

**head of his army**

And then King Philip died. At the age of

twenty, Alexander became king of Macedonia.

Although young in years, Alexander led his

army through Greece, fighting and conquering

2. **Literal** What important lesson did Alexander learn from Aristotle? _(Aristotle_
_taught him the importance of observing and studying facts before making_
_decisions.)_


3. **Literal** What observation did Alexander make about the wild horse,
Bucephalus, and how did he tame him? _(He realized the horse was afraid of_
_his shadow so he turned the horse’s face into the sun so he would not see his_
_shadow and be afraid, and he offered him sugar to win his favor.)_


4. **Inferential** Why did Alexander’s devoted soldiers think he was a brave
fighter? _(He would ride in the front of his army and take the same risks he_
_asked of his men; he never retreated or gave up a fight.)_


Check for Understanding


What are some adjectives you could use to describe Alexander?
_(ambitious, clever, intelligent, etc.)_


5. **Evaluative** _Think-Pair-Share:_ Why do you think Alexander was and still is
known as Alexander the Great? _(Answers may vary, but may include that he_
_was an important leader who conquered Greece.)_

~~**WORD WORK: TAME (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Alexander realized he would have to use his
mind as well as his muscles to tame the horse.”


2. Say the word _tame_ with me.


3. _Tame_ means to train to obey people.


4. Some animals are impossible to tame and should remain in nature.


5. Have you ever seen someone tame an animal or ever tried to tame one
yourself? Try to use the word _tame_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three
students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses: “I saw
someone tame a once,” or “I tried to tame a once.”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** You have heard that the
word _tame_ means to train to obey people. I will describe a situation. If what
I describe is an example of something you could tame, say, “I can tame it.”
If what I describe is an example of something you could not tame, say, “I
cannot tame it.” ( _Answers may vary for all._ )

**Show Image 12A-1: Alexander motioning his**

King Alexander of Macedonia led his Greek

by ship across the channel of water that

separated Europe from Asia. ~~_[On Poster 1,_~~

~~_Hellespont channel.] Who else crossed this_~~

~~_same channel, but in the opposite direction on foot by using a ship bridge?_~~

~~_(Xerxes and the Persian soldiers)_~~ As the boats approached the far shore,

Alexander **flung** ~~_or threw with great force_~~ his spear so that it landed point
first in Asian soil. Stepping from his boat, he freed the spear and told his

cheering men, “We will conquer Asia with our spears!”


Leading the army down the coast of the Aegean Sea, he stopped at the

site of ancient Troy. Here, nine centuries before, the Greeks had fought a

famous war, the story of which had been told in a well-known book called

_The Iliad_ [/ il*ee* ə d/]. Since boyhood, Alexander had set a goal for himself:

“I want people to remember me forever as a great hero, just as we remember

Achilles [/ ə *kil*eez/], the greatest hero in _The Iliad,_ ” he said. That goal

of undying fame, more than anything else, would drive Alexander onward

through his many adventures.

**Show Image 12A-2: Greek citizens cheering**

**Alexander’s army**

As Alexander continued down the Aegean

coast, citizens of Greek city-states that had

developed in Asia welcomed Alexander’s army.

“Alexander will free us from Persian rule!” the

people cheered. “We will live as free Greeks

once more!”



Alexander told them, “Yes, we will free you.” ~~_Do you think this was true?_~~

Yet, once his army took over a city or a nation, Alexander never gave up his

control. He was determined to set the record for ruling the greatest empire in

history, and he didn’t think he could do that by freeing people and places he

had conquered. ~~_How do you think the Greek people felt about King Alexander_~~

~~_after they realized he wasn’t going to let them live freely? Do you think they_~~

~~_continued to cheer for him?_~~


**Show Image 12A-3: Greek army charging**

**Show Image 12A-4: Alexander approaching**

**the Gordian Knot**

Afterward they reached the city of Gordia

[/ gor*dee* ə /], where Alexander was shown

the chariot of the ancient founder of the city.

This ancient chariot was tied to a pole with

a large knot. The elderly priests smiled at the

young **invader.** ~~_Have you heard this word_~~



~~_before? What do you think this word means? An invader is someone who enters a_~~

~~_country by force in order to conquer it._~~ “Legend says that only he who unties

the Gordian knot can rule Asia,” the priests said, knowing it would take days

or weeks to do so. But with lightning speed, Alexander drew his sword, and in

one mighty stroke, sliced the knot in half. “What a pleasant legend,” he said,

and rode on laughing. ~~_So did King Alexander actually untie the knot?_~~


Lesson 12 Alexander the Great, Part II
**183**


**Show Image 12A-5: Alexander in Egypt,**
**writing to Aristotle**

~~_What do you see in the picture?_~~ Alexander

continued on to Egypt, which was also under

Persian control. ~~_[Show Egypt on a world map_~~

~~_or globe.]_~~ He defeated the Persian armies

there, and the Egyptians **proclaimed** ~~_or_~~

~~_officially called_~~ him pharaoh, or king. While



**184**



in Egypt, and all through his travels, he sent samples of local plants and

animals to his old teacher, Aristotle, so the great scientist could examine

them. ~~_Why do you think he sent plants and animals to Aristotle?_~~ ~~(Because~~

~~Aristotle enjoyed observing and asking questions about things.)~~ Alexander

also tried to answer a question the wise man had long hoped to figure out:

why does the Nile River flood in the spring?


“I cannot prove it without following the river all the way to its beginnings,”

Alexander wrote, “and this I have no time to do. But after talking with the

most educated Egyptians, I believe that during each spring, rains fill the lakes

in the mountains of northern Africa. The lakes overflow into the Nile, which

carries the water down to the flatlands of Egypt.” He was right, and Aristotle

sent a letter of thanks. ~~_[You may wish to remind students of the importance_~~

~~_of flooding rivers for farming in ancient civilizations.]_~~


**Show Image 12A-6: Alexander victorious over**

**the Persians**

By the time the letter reached Alexander,

however, he was back in Persia, winning

battle after battle. At one of these battles,

the Persians had many more soldiers than

Alexander commanded. The Persian king felt

so sure of victory that he left his family and a

good deal of his treasure in a nearby city. When Alexander won the fight, he

marched into that city and took the king’s treasure for himself and his men.

After several more victories, Alexander at last defeated the Persians for good

and crowned himself king of Asia. ~~_Were your predictions correct?_~~


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


**Show Image 12A-7: Alexander’s wedding to**

**Persian princess**

As he continually fought these wars, Alexander

insisted that his goal was to win glory for

himself and his troops and to prove no one

else was stronger in force. ~~_Do you think this_~~

~~_was a good goal to have?_~~ After Alexander’s

success, thousands of his Greek soldiers



married Persian women. He also took Persian soldiers into his army so they

could learn Greek ideas from his soldiers. He and his lifelong best friend even

married two of the king of Persia’s daughters in a double wedding ceremony.

“We will unite all of our empire into one great nation,” Alexander **proclaimed.**

~~_What does_~~ ~~proclaimed~~ ~~_mean? What did Alexander proclaim?_~~


Alexander was so busy trying to conquer more and more places that he

was not able to give much **attention** to the places he had already taken

over. ~~Attention~~ ~~_means close observation or thought. Do you think this lack_~~

~~_of attention was helpful or hurtful to Alexander’s rule?_~~ Instead, he left

behind generals he trusted to rule for him or let the kings he had conquered

continue to run their countries while reporting to him. Then Alexander moved

on. Without more attention on his part, his grand plan never completely

succeeded. ~~_What does_~~ ~~grand~~ ~~_mean?_~~


**Show Image 12A-8: Alexander in India;**

**soldiers facing elephants**

At the same time, Alexander began to claim,

“I am one of the gods—for who but a god

could do all that I have done?” It was around

this time that people began to refer to him





as “Alexander the Great.” He was probably

the first one to say it. Always restless, he was



never satisfied that he had done enough in his life.


Even conquering Persia did not satisfy him. “We’ll continue east to India,” he

ordered. ~~_[Show India on a world map or globe.]_~~ Fighting over great distances

and rugged mountains, Alexander’s soldiers reached northern India, where

they found themselves facing a strong Indian army that featured a terrible

new threat. ~~_What do you think this new threat was? Do you think this new_~~

~~_threat stopped Alexander’s attack on India?_~~


Lesson 12 Alexander the Great, Part II
**185**


“What on earth is that thing?” one Macedonian soldier asked another.


“I don’t know,” replied his friend, “but I’ve never seen anything so big!”


In fact, the monsters they were facing were elephants, atop which rode

Indian soldiers directing the huge beasts to attack and trample their

enemies. Alexander ordered to the front of his army spearmen carrying

spears twenty-one feet long. He told them, “Do not let those beasts get close

enough to reach you!” With their usual confidence in Alexander, his men

frightened off the elephants and won the battle.

refused to obey him. ~~_Why do you think the men refused to obey Alexander?_~~

Men who had been with him from the start explained, “We have marched by

your side and fought as brothers under your command for thirteen years. We

are far from Macedonia. Please, take us home.” Alexander could not deny his

men this request, so they turned around for home.


That is when Alexander discovered that he was not a god. ~~_Do you really think_~~

~~_Alexander thought he was a god? Why or why not?_~~ At only thirty-three years

old, Alexander had lived through enough adventures for a hundred lifetimes,

and had worn out the energetic body he had built to such strength as a

youngster. He fell ill, still many miles from home. ~~_What do you think is going_~~

~~_to happen to Alexander?_~~


**Show Image 12A-10: Alexander, his generals**
**gathered around him**

Alexander lay in his large travel tent. His

generals gathered around him, each hoping

to become king and rule Alexander’s great

empire after his death. They asked, “To which





of us do you leave your empire?”


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government



**186**


He laughed and answered, “To the strongest!” Then he closed his eyes. He

had laughed because he knew what would happen next, and he turned out to

be right. Fighting for control of his empire, his men would break it into pieces.

None of them would match his record as the mightiest conqueror of all.


**Show Image 12A-11: Statue of Alexander the**

As a result, he would never be forgotten. He

would always be remembered as Alexander

the Great. ~~_So did Alexander obtain the undying_~~

~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Evaluative** Were your predictions about Alexander’s greatest adventure
correct? Why or why not? _(Answers may vary.)_


2. **Evaluative** Legend said that only the person who untied the Gordian Knot
would rule Asia. How did Alexander respond to this, and was his response
surprising? Why? _(He didn’t try to untie it but simply used his sword to cut it_
_in half. Students’ opinions on whether or not this is surprising may vary.)_


3. **Literal** What happened to Alexander and his army in India? _(At first they_
_conquered part of India, but then Alexander’s army did not want to fight any_
_longer and wanted to go home. Then Alexander died.)_


Check for Understanding


For what accomplishment is Alexander the Great remembered
and named? _(He created the largest empire in the world during_
_his time.)_


4. **Evaluative** The Read-Aloud told us that Alexander was too busy trying to
conquer more and more places to give much attention to the places he had
already taken over. Who taught Alexander the importance of observation, or
attention? _(Aristotle)_ Do you think Alexander forgot about the importance
of this skill? How did this affect his ability to be a good leader? _(Answers_
_may vary.)_

  - Remind students that Alexander the Great was a famous invader who fought
many battles and won many victories that increased the size of his empire.
Give each student a copy of Activity Page 12.1. Tell students that this map
shows the many regions that composed Alexander the Great’s empire. Help
students interpret the map to answer the following questions:


    - What does the shaded area stand for on the map? ( _Alexander the Great’s_
_empire, or places he conquered_ )


    - Which area of land was larger: the area where the ancient Greek civilization
existed, or the area that Alexander the Great conquered? ( _the area that_
_Alexander the Great conquered_ ) [You may wish to show students Poster 1
and this map to compare the two areas.]


  - Have students write a complete sentence to answer each question on the
worksheet.


~~**EDIT A FICTIONAL NARRATIVE (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that revising and editing is the next step in the writing process.


  - Tell students they are going to revise and edit the fictional narratives they
wrote on Activity Page 11.1. Explain that this means they are going to read the
story to check for any mistakes, and to make sure they have said everything
they wanted or needed to say.


  - Give students Activity Page 12.2. to use as a checklist to revise and edit their
fictional narratives. Review what each item on the checklist represents.

- Have students review their writing for places to add prepositions and
prepositional phrases and for correct use of pronoun cases.


- To review prepositions and prepositional phrases, explain to students that
a preposition is a word that can help tell where something is taking place.
Words like _in, out, under, above,_ etc. are called _prepositions_ . Prepositions are
useful in making simple sentences longer and more interesting.


- Explain to students that a prepositional phrase is a phrase that begins with
a preposition and is followed by an object (e.g., _in the cave, on the table,_
_under the rock, above the clouds_ ). A prepositional phrase answers the same
question, _where,_ that a preposition answers about something in a sentence.
Both prepositions and prepositional phrases connect a noun to the rest of
the sentence.


Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


- Write the following sentences on the board. Ask students to come up
and underline the preposition. After underlining, ask students to read the
prepositional phrase.


  - The remote fell under my bed.


  - My mom put the groceries in the trunk of the car.


  - The birds flew above the trees.


- Have students revise their writing to include prepositions.


- To reinforce how to edit drafts for pronoun cases (subjective, objective, and
possessive), explain the differences between them and provide examples:










|Case|Pronouns|Use|Examples|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Subjective**|I, you, he, she,<br>it, we, you,<br>they|Use as the subject of a<br>sentence.|She runs a mile every day.<br>You and I hike two miles.|
|**Objective**|me, you, him,<br>her, it, us, you,<br>them|Use after an action verb.<br>Use after a preposition,<br>such as:_in, at, before, on,_<br>_to, with, near,_or_from._|Mom drove us to the park.<br>Dad read the map with me.|

  - Model choosing the correct pronoun for each of the following sentences:

_____ plays soccer on the weekends. (I, me, my)
Carlos passed _____ the ball. (I, me, my)
I was proud of _____ team. (I, me, my)


  - Have students review their writing for correct use of pronouns.


Check for Understanding


According to the checklist, what are you going to look for in your
stories? _(punctuation, capitalization, character with a name,_
_information about ancient Greece, prepositions and prepositional_
_phrases, and pronouns)_

- Tell students to read their stories, checking for each item on the list. If
students find something they want to add or edit in their stories, have them
mark it in a different color or with a different type of writing utensil in their
stories. Remind students that they can reference Activity Page 10.1 with their
original plans to help them add to and edit their stories.


- If students have time after editing, have them publish, or rewrite, their
stories on a new sheet of paper. You may want to add this story to
students’ writing portfolios.

Unit 2 Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government


**You Were There: Ancient Greece**

 - Have students pretend that they lived back in the time of ancient Greece.
They may wish to be at a dinner party with Socrates, an observer watching
young Alexander riding Bucephalus, or a soldier seeing an elephant for the
first time. Ask students to describe what they see and hear. For example,
for the dinner party with Socrates, students may talk about speaking with
political leaders, eating delicious food, or seeing famous Greek actors, etc.
They may talk about hearing the stories of Socrates or listening to people
laughing and engaging in philosophical debates. Consider also extending this
activity by adding group or independent writing opportunities associated
with the “You Were There” concept. For example, ask students to pretend
they are newspaper reporters who have conducted an interview with
Socrates, and have them write a group news article describing his thoughts.


**Class Book: Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government**


Materials: Drawing paper, drawing tools

 - Tell the class or a group of students that they are going to add to the class
book they started previously to help them remember what they have
learned in this unit. Have students brainstorm important information about
the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, the Greek philosophers, and
Alexander the Great. Have each student choose one idea to draw a picture
of, and ask each to write a caption for the picture. Bind the pages to make a
book to put in the class library for students to read again and again.


**Poetry Reading**


Materials: Activity Page CA.1

 - Tell students that you are going to read a poem titled “Battle at
Thermopylae.” Tell them to listen carefully to find out what information is
being shared in this poem. Discuss what the following lines might mean, and
help students to orally summarize the poem with a sentence summarizing
each verse. Then have students use Activity Page CA.1 to write their own
summary. _(The Greeks were very brave and full of honor as they fought_
_against great odds to protect their freedom. Both armies—one small and one_
_large—suffered losses, but in the end, only one could win.)_ Allow students to
share their summaries with the class.

_Greeks who fought for another day._
_Free from Persia’s army bound,_
_Thermopylae is target ground._
_Fought for freedom on this day,_
_both sides fall, but one will stay._
_One is small, one has might,_
_who will win this freedom fight?_


**Dinner Party**


Materials: White sheets; various foods from Greece


**Note:** Be sure to follow your school’s policy regarding food distribution and
allergies.


 - Tell students that they are going to have a Greek “dinner party.” Have
students bring in a white sheet to wear over their clothes like the tunics worn
by the ancient Greeks. Remind students that many Greek men, including
Socrates and the other philosophers, gathered together at dinner parties
to eat and drink and talk about philosophy and other topics. Have students
talk about the Olympic games (sports), music, art, literature, and other
interesting topics the ancient Greeks would have discussed while students
drink grape juice and eat grapes, raisins, figs, honey fritters, and other foods
from ancient Greece.
