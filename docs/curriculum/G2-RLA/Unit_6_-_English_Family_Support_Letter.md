# **Welcome!**
#### **Grade 2, Unit 6**
## **Insects: All Around**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will be introduced to the largest group of animals on Earth: insects.

The Read-Alouds in this unit are narrated by different insect characters and even by an
entomologist, making the reading even more engaging and fun.

### **What’s the story?**

Students will learn about the **characteristics and** **life cycles** of insects. They will also
explore how **important** this **group of animals** is and how we view them.

### **What will my student learn?**

Students will learn about the different **characteristics**, **life cycles**, and **classification** of
insects. They will also learn how they are viewed as **harmful or helpful** and how
important they are to **pollination** and the production of **honey**, **cosmetics**, and
**medicines** .


Students will **classify** and **categorize** insects based on their defining characteristics. They
will also **identify** ways in which insects can be harmful or helpful. Students will use the
writing process to **plan**, **draft**, and **edit** an **informational** **narrative** in the same style of
the Read-Alouds.

### **Conversation starters**

Ask your student questions about the unit to promote discussion and continued learning:

1. Name an insect you have learned about and the habitat it lives in.

**Follow up:** How does that insect survive in its habitat?

2. Draw a picture of an ant for me.

**Follow up:** Can you label the body parts of an ant? What do each of these parts do
for the ant? Do all insects have similar parts? What are some things they all have
that make them an insect?

3. What is the life cycle of a praying mantis? (Describe it or draw it.)

**Follow up:** Why is it called an incomplete metamorphosis?

4. Why are honeybees considered social insects?

**Follow up:** Tell me about their waggle dance. What other insects are considered
social insects? Why?

5. What is your favorite insect you learned about?

**Follow up:** Why? How does that insect communicate? Is it considered a social insect
or a solitary insect? Why?
