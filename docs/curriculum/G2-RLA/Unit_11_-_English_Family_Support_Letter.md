# **Welcome!**
#### **Grade 2, Unit 11**
## **Flight and the** **Story of Aviation**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will be introduced to the history of aviation and to aviators from
different time periods, countries, and cultures.

### **What's the story?**

Students will study the **science of flight** from the physics concept of **lift** . They will explore
the **successes and failures** in the construction of the first flying machines and will learn
about the **social impact** of the world of flight.

### **What will my student learn?**

Students will learn about the **successes and failures** **early aviators faced** to achieve their
goal of flying. They will connect this to what they have already learned about early Greek
civilizations and Greek myths. As they explore the historic figures of aviation, students will
learn how **determination and drive** can help people **achieve their goal** .


Students will learn and practice **research and inquiry** **skills**, identifying questions they
would like to ask to learn more about aviators. They will let their research skills take flight
as they explore **key figures and concepts** from the world of aviation by creating
**informational texts** that will be compiled into an **Aviators Hall of Fame** .

### **Conversation starters**

Ask your student questions about the unit to promote discussion and continued learning:


1. What were some of the earliest attempts humans made at flying?

**Follow up:** Were these attempts successful?

2. What does an airplane need to stay in the air?

**Follow up:** What were some discoveries that the earliest aviators made as they were

3. Who were some of the aviators you learned about in this unit?

**Follow up:** How were they similar? How were they different?

4. Some of the aviators you learned about had many failed attempts at flying. Who
