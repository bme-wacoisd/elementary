**Flip Book Introduction**


This Flip Book contains images that accompany the Teacher
Guide for _Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops_ . The images
are in sequential order. Each image is identified by its lesson
number, read-aloud letter (A or B), and the number of the
image within the particular read-aloud. For example, the first
image in Read-Aloud 1A is numbered 1A-1. Once you have
worked your way through the book to the last page, you will flip
the entire book over to view the second half of the images.


Depending on your classroom configuration, you may need
to have students sit closer to the flip book in order to see the
images clearly.

CO2 is the scientific
abbreviation of Carbon
Dioxide. The tree’s
leaves take in carbon
dioxide, which is why
the arrow is pointing
towards the tree.


O2 is the scientific
abbreviation of Oxygen.
After trees take in
carbon dioxide, they
release oxygen for us to
breathe, which is why
the arrow is pointing
away from the tree.
