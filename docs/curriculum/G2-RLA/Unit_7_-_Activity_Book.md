Dear Family Member,


Over the course of the next couple of weeks, your student will learn about the U.S.
Civil War and how the end of the war also meant the end of the evil institution of slavery in
the United States. During the next several days, your student will be learning about what
life was like in the North and the South before the U.S. Civil War. They will learn about the
conflicting ideas about slavery during the founding of our country, and the motivations of
many of those opposed to slavery, including those influenced by the Great Awakenings.
They will learn about the differences between the North and the South, and how the U.S.
Civil War began. They will also learn about some geographic locations, as well as some
important people in the years leading up to the war, including abolitionists like Frederick
Douglass and Harriet Tubman. They will also study Abraham Lincoln. Below are some suggestions for activities you may do at home to reinforce what your student is learning about
this time leading up to the U.S. Civil War.


1. Using a Map


Help your student locate the areas of the North and the South on a map of the United States. Have your student tell you some of the differences between the two at the time
of the U.S. Civil War.


2. Harriet Tubman


Your student will learn about the life and contributions of abolitionists like Harriet
Tubman. Ask why Harriet Tubman escaped to the North and why she returned to the South
many times after her escape. Ask your student to tell you about the Underground Railroad.


3. Abraham Lincoln


Talk with your student about this important historical figure. Point out his image on
a penny or a five-dollar bill. Ask your student about his life and the contributions that he
made. Ask your student what role Abraham Lincoln had in the U.S. Civil War.

4. Words to Use


Below is a list of vocabulary words that your student will be learning and using. Try
to use these words as they come up in everyday speech with your student.

find a middle ground.

_•_ _contributions_   - Harriet Tubman made important _contributions_ to help those who
were still enslaved.

_•_ _economy_   - The _economy_ of the North was largely dependent on factories,
whereas the economy of the South was largely dependent on plantations.

_•_ _slavery_   - _Slavery_ in the United States finally ended after the U.S. Civil War.

_•_ _territories_   - As the United States was forming, there were parts of the country
known as _territories_ that would later be divided into states.


5. Read-Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read with your student every day. There should be time
to read to your student and also time to listen to your student read to you. Be sure to let
your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they have learned at school.

**Christmas Bells**


Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
1807 – 1882


1 I heard the bells on Christmas Day

2 Their old, familiar carols play,

3 And wild and sweet

4 The words repeat

5 Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

6 And thought how, as the day had come,

7 The belfries of all Christendom

8 Had rolled along

9 The unbroken song

10 Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

11 Till ringing, singing on its way,

12 The world revolved from night to day,

13 A voice, a chime,

14 A chant sublime

15 Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

16 Then from each black, accursed mouth

17 The cannon thundered in the South,

18 And with the sound

19 The carols drowned

20 Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

21 It was as if an earthquake rent

22 The hearth-stones of a continent,

23 And made forlorn

24 The households born

25 Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

26 And in despair I bowed my head;

27 “There is no peace on earth,” I said;

28 “For hate is strong,

29 And mocks the song

3o Of peace on earth, good-will to men!”

31 Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:

32 “God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;

33 The Wrong shall fail,

34 The Right prevail,

35 With peace on earth, good-will to men.”

## 6.1



I hope your student has enjoyed learning about what life was like in the North and
the South before the U.S. Civil War. Over the next several days, they will learn about the
armies of the Union and the Confederacy as the battles began, as well as the generals who
led those armies. They will also learn about several other important events and people,
including the Emancipation Proclamation, Clara Barton, and the conclusion of the Civil
War. Below are some suggestions for discussions you can have and activities you may do
at home to reinforce what your student is learning about the U.S. Civil War.


1. Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee


Have your student talk about the important jobs of these two generals. Talk about
how Grant and Lee were similar and how they were different. Ask your student about each
general’s nickname and how he earned it.


2. Clara Barton


Ask your student to tell you about the important work of Clara Barton and how she
earned the nickname “Angel of the Battlefield” while caring for wounded soldiers during
the Civil War. Discuss with your student what it means to be compassionate. Talk about
ways for your student to be helpful to those around them, even when it isn’t easy. Whenever there is mention in the news of the work of the Red Cross, ask your student who founded the American Red Cross.


3. Sayings and Phrases: “A house divided”


Your student has learned the saying “a house divided.” Talk with your student about
its meaning. Talk about a time when there was a disagreement or when something felt a
bit mixed up. Share how you worked to make things better. Find opportunities to use this
saying.

**Poetry Analysis: “Battle Hymn of the Republic”**


**Full Song Lyrics**


**1** Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword:
His truth is marching on.


**Refrain**
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.


**2** I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I can read the righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on. [Refrain]


**3** He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of all before His judgment seat;
O be swift, my soul, to answer Him be jubilant, my feet!

Our God is marching on. [Refrain]


**4** In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make us holy, let us die that all be free!
While God is marching on. [Refrain]
