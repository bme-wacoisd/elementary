Lesson 5: “Christmas Bells” by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow


I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old, familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet
The words repeat
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!


And thought how, as the day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along
The unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!


Till ringing, singing on its way,
The world revolved from night to day,
A voice, a chime,
A chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!



Then from each black, accursed mouth
The cannon thundered in the South,
And with the sound
The carols drowned
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!


It was as if an earthquake rent
The hearth-stones of a continent,
And made forlorn
The households born
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!


And in despair I bowed my head;
“There is no peace on earth,” I said;
“For hate is strong,
And mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!”


Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
“God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;
The Wrong shall fail,
The Right prevail,
With peace on earth, good-will to men.”

Lesson 7: “Battle Hymn of the Republic” Lyrics


1 Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
2 He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
3 He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword:
4 His truth is marching on. [Refrain:]
5 Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
6 Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
7 Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
8 His truth is marching on.


9 I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
10 They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
11 I can read the righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps;
12 His day is marching on. [Refrain]


13 He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
14 He is sifting out the hearts of all before His judgment seat;
15 O be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!
16 Our God is marching on. [Refrain]

17 In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
18 With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me;
19 As He died to make us holy, let us die that all be free!
20 While God is marching on. [Refrain]
