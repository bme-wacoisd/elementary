## 1.2 Take-Home



During the next several days, your student will be hearing stories about the War of
1812. They will learn about the events that led to the war, how Great Britain was already
involved in the Napoleonic Wars with France, how British soldiers captured Americans
and made them fight for the British navy, and about the famous American battleship, the
USS _Constitution._ They will also learn about some geographic locations, as well as some
important people involved in the War of 1812, including President James Madison and his
wife Dolley Madison. Below are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home
to reinforce what your student is learning about the War of 1812.


1. James Madison


Talk with your student about this important historical figure. James Madison was the
fourth president of the United States. Point out that he is one of the Founding Fathers who
wrote the Constitution. Discuss the contributions that he made. Ask your student what
role James Madison had in the War of 1812.


2. Dolley Madison


Your student will learn that Dolley Madison was married to James Madison. She was
previously married to a man named John Payne; however, her first husband and one of her
young sons died of yellow fever. Dolley Madison was known as an excellent hostess. She
was the first president’s wife to be called First Lady.


3. USS Constitution/“Old Ironsides”


Your student will learn about the famous United States battleship, the USS
_Constitution._ The USS _Constitution_ is the oldest American battleship that is still afloat, and
is now located in Boston Harbor. They will also learn about the _Constitution_ ’s nickname,
“Old Ironsides,” and how it got that name. Take this opportunity to talk to your student
about the important job of the military, and the navy in particular, especially if you have
family members who are veterans or who actively serve.

Dear Family Member,


## 5.3 Take-Home



I hope your student has enjoyed learning about the War of 1812. Over the next several
days, they will learn about the British’s three-part plan to defeat the United States,
including attacks on Lake Erie and in Washington, D.C., the Battle at Fort McHenry, and
the Battle of New Orleans. They will also learn that the Battle of New Orleans was actually
fought after the war had ended. They will also learn about some geographic locations,
and some important people involved in the War of 1812, including Francis Scott Key, Mary
Pickersgill, and Andrew Jackson.


Below are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to reinforce what
your student is learning about the War of 1812.


1. The President’s House


Today your student heard about the British attack on Washington, D.C., during which
the British set fire to many official buildings in the capital, including the President’s House.
They learned how Dolley Madison escaped before the soldiers arrived and how she saved a
portrait of George Washington. You might explain that the President’s House is now known
as the White House.


2. Francis Scott Key


Your student will also learn about the Battle at Fort McHenry, and how Francis Scott
Key watched the “rockets’ red glare” and “bombs bursting in air” from the harbor. They will
also hear how Francis Scott Key was inspired to write a poem about it. The poem he wrote
became our national anthem, “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Ask your student about the
giant flag that Mary Pickersgill made to fly over Fort McHenry that day.


3. Song: “The Star-Spangled Banner”


Listen to the song “The Star-Spangled Banner” with your student. Discuss with your
student that this song is our national anthem. It was written by Francis Scott Key during the
War of 1812. Talk about times when you might sing the national anthem. Remind them that,
when they hear the song played in public, they should stand to show respect. Also, they may
put their hand over their heart. The next time you hear the song played at a ball game or
other event, ask your student who wrote “The Star-Spangled Banner.”

4. Andrew Jackson


Have your student talk about Andrew Jackson’s role in the Battle of New Orleans. Discuss
how General Andrew Jackson put together an army of militiamen, soldiers, Native Americans,
African Americans, farmers, and even pirates to win the Battle of New Orleans. You might want
to explain that Andrew Jackson later became the seventh president of the United States.


5. Using a Map


Help your student locate the areas they learned about on a map of the United States,
including the Mississippi River, New Orleans, Canada, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C.
Have your student tell you about Britain’s three-part plan to defeat the United States.


6. Sayings and Phrases: “Where There’s a Will, There’s a Way”


Your student will learn the saying “where there’s a will, there’s a way” in relation to
how Andrew Jackson did whatever it took to win the Battle of New Orleans. Talk with your
student about its meaning. Share something that you have accomplished because of your
determination. Find opportunities to use this saying again and again.


7. Words to Use


Below is a list of some of the words that your student has been learning about and
using. Try to use these words as they come up in everyday speech with your student.

     - _navigator_ —The ship’s navigator helped the captain locate the harbor.

     - _truce_ —One British officer gave his sword to a U.S. officer as a sign of truce.

     - _treaty_ —Andrew Jackson received the news that a peace treaty had been signed.

     - _surrender_ —The soldiers had to surrender when they knew they couldn’t win.


**8. Read Aloud Each Day**

your student and also time to listen to your student read to you.
