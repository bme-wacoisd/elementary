#### Introduction


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching _The Human_
_Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition_ unit. The Teacher Guide for _The Human Body: Building Blocks_
_and Nutrition_ contains nine daily lessons, each of which is composed of two distinct parts, so that
the lesson may be divided into smaller chunks of time and presented at different intervals during
the day. Each entire lesson will require a total of sixty minutes.


This unit includes a two-day Pausing Point after Lesson 4 when students have covered the topic of
organs. At the end of the unit, a two-day Unit Review, a Unit Assessment, and Culminating Activities
are included to allow time to review, reinforce, assess, and remediate content knowledge. You should
spend no more than fifteen days total on this unit.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


At the back of this Teacher Guide you will fin d a section titled “Teacher Resources.” In this section
you will find the following:

Introduction
**1**


~~**WHY THE HUMAN BODY: BUILDING BLOCKS AND NUTRITION IS IMPORTANT**~~


This unit covers a number of topics regarding the human body. This unit first covers concepts
regarding cells and how cells form the building blocks of life on Earth. Students are then taught
how collections of cells form tissues, how tissues form organs, and finally, how organs work within
various body systems. In addition, students are taught about Anton van Leeuwenhoek and his work
with the microscope and his discovery of the tiny one-celled bacteria.


Students will then hear about the digestive and excretory systems. They will learn the fundamental
parts and functions of these two body systems. The narrator of these Read-Alouds is a nutritionist
named Nick Nutri, who reinforces basic facts that students will be learning.


The remainder of this unit focuses on the importance of good nutrition and how to make good
choices in order to eat a well-balanced diet. Students will be taught five keys to good health—eat
well, exercise, sleep, keep clean, and have regular checkups.


The text that students will be reading and discussing in this unit provides opportunities for students to
build content knowledge and draw connections to science. You may build on class discussions to support
students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of Organisms and Environments, Scientific
and Engineering Practices, and Recurring Themes and Concepts from the Science TEKS. This content is
not a replacement for grade level science instruction. For more information about the quantitative and
qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity
in the Teacher Resources.


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED**~~


The following units, and the specific core content that was targeted in those units, are particularly
relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition_ .
This background knowledge will greatly enhance students’ understanding of the Read-Alouds they
are about to enjoy:


**The Five Senses (Kindergarten)**


**The Human Body (Grade 1)**


~~**CORE CONTENT OBJECTIVES ADDRESSED IN THIS UNIT**~~


Students will:

     - Identify the five senses and associated body parts


     - Identify the skeletal, muscular, circulatory, nervous, digestive, and excretory systems as important
systems in the human body


     - Describe the significant contributions of Anton van Leeuwenhoek


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition
**2**


 - Explain that all living things are made of microscopic cells


 - Describe the relationship between cells, tissues, organs, and systems


 - Identify important components of the digestive system and their functions


 - Describe the process of nourishing the body from the time food is taken into the mouth until waste is
removed from the body


 - Identify important components of the excretory system and their functions


 - Describe how the digestive and excretory systems work together


 - Explain the importance of vitamins and minerals to the body


 - Explain the importance of eating a balanced diet


 - Plan a daily balanced diet


~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR THE HUMAN BODY: BUILDING BLOCKS AND NUTRITION**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _The Human Body: Building Blocks_
_and Nutrition_ in the forms in which they appear in the unit. These words appear in the Read-Alouds
or, in some instances, in the “Introducing the Read-Aloud” section at the beginning of the lesson.
Boldfaced words in the list have an associated Word Work activity. The inclusion of the words on this
list does not mean that students are immediately expected to be able to use all of these words on
their own. However, through repeated exposure throughout all lessons, they should acquire a good
understanding of most of these words and begin to use some of them in conversation.

~~**“THE AMAZING HUMAN BODY” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 1A-1: Nick Nutri presents**

Hello, everybody. My name is Nick Nutri, and

I am a **nutritionist** . Does anyone know what

that means? Nutritionists study **nutrition**, or

in other words, the ways in which our bodies

get the food they need to grow and stay





healthy. We give advice about diet and how a

person’s diet affects their health.



Nutritionists learn what is in our food and how our bodies use it. I work with

doctors to help children understand what they need to do to take care of

their bodies.


One of the first things a nutritionist studies is the human body. It’s important

to understand how the body works in order to know how to keep it healthy.

Dr. Welbody tells me that you already know a lot about the human body.

the word _healthy_ .

Lesson 1 The Amazing Human Body
**9**


**Show Image 1A-2: Skin is for feeling**

Where’s your skin? It’s all over you, isn’t

it? Skin covers your head, your face, your

neck, your chest, your tummy, arms, legs,

hands, and feet—everything! Your skin is a

stretchy, waterproof covering that protects

you from germs and helps control your body

temperature.



Challenge


Point out that the
word _waterproof_ is a
compound word, or
one word made up of
two separate words.
Have students identify
the two word parts of
_waterproof_ and have
them define the word
based on what they
know of the individual
word components.



Just beneath your skin are tiny little receptors, part of your nervous system,

that connect to your brain. ~~_These receptors, or nerve endings, react to_~~

~~_changes, like heat and cold in the body, and send messages to the brain._~~ You

can’t see them, but they tell your brain what is touching your skin and your

brain reacts to the touch. Some touches, like petting a dog, can be very

positive, while others, like touching a jagged rock or slimy surface, can be

quite uncomfortable.


Touch is one of your five senses. Who can name the other four senses that

help you get information about your surroundings? ~~_[Pause for suggestions:_~~

~~_taste, smell, sight, hearing.]_~~ Oh, Dr. Welbody was right. You do know a lot!


**Show Image 1A-3: Nose and mouth are for**
**smelling and tasting**

Touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing are your

five senses. Let’s sit down and find out what

you already know about your body.





Where is your sense of taste located?

Right—in your mouth! Your tongue is covered

with taste buds that allow you to taste the



**10**



differences between sweet, salty, bitter, and sour foods. They also warn you

of danger from hot foods or other things that may harm your body.


Did you know that your sense of smell is connected to your sense of taste?

That’s why some things don’t taste the same to you when you have a cold.

What part of your body is affected the most when you have the sniffles? Yes,

your nose! And look how close your nose is to your mouth. It makes sense

that they are connected, doesn’t it?


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition


**Show Image 1A-4: Eyes are for seeing**

Just above your nose are your eyes. Which of

your senses do they control? Sight, of course!

Your eyes are responsible for what you see.

Vision ~~_or your ability to see_~~ lets you know the

size, shape, and color of an object, how near or

far it is, and how fast it is moving. That’s a lot

of information. Some people have problems



seeing correctly, but fortunately they are able to have many of these

problems corrected by wearing glasses or contact lenses.


**Show Image 1A-5: Ears are for hearing**

Okay, we’ve named four of the five senses—

touch, taste, smell, and sight. The last one is

hearing. What do you use to hear? Your ears,

of course! Your ears catch and change sound

waves into nerve signals that travel to your





brain. Your ears not only help you hear, but

they also help you keep your balance. Some



people are born deaf, ~~_or unable to hear_~~ and some others develop deafness

later in life. Hearing aids often help them hear better.


**Show Image 1A-6: We all have bodies**

Look around you. You all have skin. You all have

eyes and noses and mouths and ears. But do

you all look the same? Certainly not! You may

look different on the outside—different colors

of skin, hair, and eyes; different heights and





weights—but what lies underneath your skin is

all pretty much the same.



You have already learned that your body is a collection of many different

**systems**, ~~_or sets of connected parts that work together_~~ each with its own job

to do. Does anyone remember the names of any body systems? ~~_[Pause for_~~

~~_suggestions.]_~~ What is your skin wrapped around? What gives your body its

shape? Your skeleton!


Lesson 1 The Amazing Human Body
**11**


**Show Image 1A-7: The circulatory, nervous,**
**respiratory, skeletal, and muscular systems**

Your skeleton is a part of the skeletal system,

including your bones and joints. It supports

your body and protects your body’s internal,

or inside, **organs** . ~~_Organs are body parts that_~~

~~_do specific jobs for the body, such as the heart,_~~

~~_lungs, brain, liver, and so on._~~ Can you find



Support


The word _nervous_
can also mean
worried or anxious.



your ribs? Your tough rib bones cover your soft heart and lungs. Together

with your muscular system, your skeletal system helps your body move. The

respiratory system is in charge of getting oxygen into your body and carbon

dioxide out. The circulatory system transports blood pumped from the heart

and carries it to all parts of your body. The nervous system is the body’s

main control center, carrying messages to and from the brain. ~~_The word_~~

~~nervous~~ ~~_—when it’s used to talk about the body’s systems—means having to_~~

~~_do with nerves._~~


Do any of these systems sound familiar to you? ~~_[Have student volunteers_~~

~~_point to the various systems under discussion.]_~~


**Show Image 1A-8: The digestive system**

Although all of the body systems are

important, the two that interest me the most

are the digestive system and the excretory

system. That’s because they are the ones most

responsible for the food that enters and leaves





your body. You get **nutrients** ~~_or substances_~~

~~_that are necessary for your body to grow_~~ from



**12**



the food you eat, and I want to make sure that your body gets the nutrients

it needs. The digestive system carries food to your stomach and small

intestines, where it breaks down food into fuel to give the body the energy it

needs to live. Food that your body can’t digest moves into the large intestine

and is released as solid waste. The excretory system removes liquid waste

from the body. We are going to talk about these two systems a lot more

another day.


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition


**Show Image 1A-9: The human machine**

People often compare the human body to a

machine with lots of movable parts working

together. ~~_Do you think the human body is like_~~

~~_a machine? If so, how is it like a machine, and_~~

~~_how is it different?_~~


**Show Image 1A-10: The human machine**
**breaks down**

Most of the time your body systems work well

together but, just like machines, sometimes

things break down. Germs may get inside your

body and cause illnesses. The body fights off

germs within the body, but sometimes the

body’s defenses are not enough.



As a baby, you may have received **vaccinations** to help prevent diseases

that were once common among children. ~~_Vaccinations are often called shots._~~

Vaccines, or the medicine in a vaccination, are inactive or weakened germs,

that are often injected ~~_or pumped_~~ into your body. These dead or weakened

germs trick the body into thinking that it is becoming infected, or getting

sick, so the body figures out how to fight off that infection. The body then

knows how to fight off any infections of that kind in the future. If you were

vaccinated against diseases like measles or mumps, you will likely not get

those diseases.


**Show Image 1A-11: Taking care of your body**

The human body is truly an amazing machine.

You carry your body with you wherever you

go. Whether you are reading, eating, playing

ball, or sleeping, your body continues to work

to keep you healthy. It is important for you





to do your part, too. What are some of the

things that you can do to take care of your

body? ~~_[Pause for suggestions.]_~~



Lesson 1 The Amazing Human Body
**13**


**14**



Germs are everywhere. How can you help your body fight off germs? Washing

your hands with soap and water is one of the most important things that

you can do. Make sure that you wash often, throughout every day and

especially before you eat. Clean the rest of your body with regular baths and

shampoos, too. Cleanliness ~~_or keeping a clean body_~~ is very important to your

body’s health.


How often have you heard an adult say, “Eat your fruits and veggies?” I told

you that I am a nutritionist. That means that good nutrition is very important

to me. ~~_What is nutrition?_~~ ~~(the process of providing the body with the food it~~

~~needs to grow and stay healthy)~~ Eating the right foods is important for good

health and that means eating lots of fruits and veggies. It is so important

that your body gets the proper nutrients to keep its marvelous machine

running smoothly.


**Show Image 1A-12: The importance of**
**exercise**

Exercise goes hand-in-hand with healthy

eating. The food you eat supplies your body

with the energy it needs to exercise its

muscles. By walking, running, and playing ball,

you help your body stay lean and fit.


Getting enough rest and having regular

checkups with health care professionals ~~_like doctors and nurses_~~ are both

important, as well. In the following lessons, we will talk about all of these

things. Taking care of your body is more than just keeping your fingers

crossed and hoping you will be healthy. By the time you finish these lessons,

**Show Image 1A-13: Anton van Leeuwenhoek**

Next time we’re together I’m going to tell you

about one of my heroes—a man named Anton

van Leeuwenhoek [/lae*v ə n - hook/]. Anton

van Leeuwenhoek is from a country called

Holland. This means he was Dutch, which is

what you call someone from Holland. Today,

Holland is part of the country known as the



Netherlands. ~~_[Point to the Netherlands on a world map or globe.]_~~ Anton

was named for where he lived in Holland. The name of his street was Lion’s

Gate and his house stood on the corner. The word for lion in Dutch is _leeuw_

[/lae/] and the word for corner is _hoek_ [/hook/]; thus, his name is Anton

who lives on the corner of Lion’s Gate. Naming people in such a way was not

uncommon when Anton was born, nearly four hundred years ago. I can’t wait

to tell you why he is my hero, but I’ll save that for next time.


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Inferential.** When you eat a sandwich, which body senses do you use, and
what are the body parts associated with each sense? _(Sight: eyes see the_
_sandwich; smell: nose smells the sandwich; taste: mouth or tongue tastes_
_the sandwich; hearing: ears hear the sandwich being eaten; touch: hands feel_
_the sandwich.)_

   - **Literal.** Sometimes when you have a cold, you lose your appetite. What
other sense, working together with your sense of taste, could affect your
appetite? _(sense of smell)_


2. **Literal.** What is the name of the body system that processes the food that
you eat? _(digestive)_ What is the name of the system that removes liquid
waste from your body? _(excretory)_ What are the other body systems?
_(skeletal, muscular, circulatory, and nervous systems)_


3. **Inferential.** Why does a nutritionist need to understand the human
body? _(Answers may vary. Students should understand that the body is a_
_complex machine that needs certain foods for the maintenance of its parts; a_
_nutritionist needs to understand the relationship between the two.)_

express general truths based on experiences and observations of everyday
life. While some proverbs do have literal meanings—that is, they mean
exactly what they say—many proverbs have a richer meaning beyond the
literal level.


 - Ask students if they have ever heard anyone say about an event to “keep
your fingers crossed” or “I’m keeping my fingers crossed.” Explain that this
proverb is another way of saying you hope for a good result from some future
event.


 - Ask students if they have ever hoped for good weather for a special event,
like field day or some outdoor activity. Tell students that instead of saying,
“I hope it doesn’t rain on field day,” they could say, “I’m keeping my fingers
crossed that it doesn’t rain on field day.”

Hi, boys and girls. Last time we were together,

I said that I would tell you about Anton van

Leeuwenhoek [/lae*v ə n*hook/] today. I do

plan to do that, but first I want to tell you a





story about me.



When I was about your age, one day my father came home with a present for

me under his arm. When I first opened it, I wasn’t sure what it was.


**Show Image 2A-2: Student microscope**

~~_[If there is a microscope in the classroom, direct_~~
~~_students’ attention to it.]_~~


It looked like this. Do you know what this is

called or what it does? My father explained





that it was a **microscope** . That was nothing

I had ever dreamed of wanting. I spent most

of my time playing outside and could barely



**24**



sit still to read a book. Why would I want this funny looking-instrument?

~~_What is a microscope? [Pause for students’ answers.] A microscope is a type_~~

~~_of scientific equipment that uses pieces of curved glass to make very small_~~

~~_things look bigger._~~


“You are so curious about everything. I thought perhaps you’d like to see what

a butterfly wing looks like close up,” my father said.


**Show Image 2A-3: Butterfly wing under a**
**microscope**

I peered through the **lens** ~~_or curved piece of_~~

~~_magnifying glass_~~ of the microscope and saw the

tiny veins and scales of a butterfly’s wing. I looked

at insect eyes and blades of grass. I looked at oak

leaves and dead bumblebees and toy soldiers. It

was the best present I had ever received.


**Show Image 2A-4: What does a magnifying**
**glass do?** ~~_[Point out to students the magnifying_~~
~~_glass in your classroom.]_~~

Have you ever used a magnifying glass? Who

can tell me what a magnifying glass is used for?

Yes, it **magnifies** objects. It makes objects look

many times larger than they really are.


It shows things that are too small to see



with the human eye alone. Sometimes people use magnifying glasses to

read really small print or to find splinters buried deep in the skin. Well, a

microscope is a lot like that but much more powerful.


So, what does that have to do with Anton van Leeuwenhoek? Well, just like

me at seven years old, the year I received my first microscope, Anton was

very curious. He also had a fascination with magnifying objects. Although

Anton was not a scientist, his work with microscopes changed the way

people thought about the human body and how it works.


**Show Image 2A-5: Threads of cloth under a**

At sixteen, Anton began working in the

textile ~~_or cloth_~~ business. His shop sold cloth,

buttons, sewing supplies, ribbons, and lace.

His customers were very particular, expecting

dresses. Anton used a magnifying glass to make sure the threads of the cloth

were straight and tightly woven. His customers appreciated Anton’s careful

**observations** . ~~_Observations are made when you look closely at the details of_~~

~~_something._~~


When he was about thirty years old, Anton took a trip from his home in

Holland to nearby England. There he discovered a book called _Micrographia_,

meaning small images.


**Show Image 2A-6: Lice**

Written by Robert Hooke, the book was full

of drawings and descriptions of objects seen

through a microscope. Anton was fascinated

by how large and detailed the micro, or small,

objects looked when seen through the lenses



Anton had been interested in science and nature ever since he was a boy,

and now he had the opportunity to study nature at a much closer range. He

carried squiggly wormlike insect larvae around in his pocket, eager to watch

the entire life cycles of insects with the aid of a microscope.


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition





of a microscope.


It was a little like someone with poor eyesight



putting on eyeglass lenses for the first time and discovering that the blurry

tree in the distance was actually made up of individual leaves. He couldn’t

wait to get home to experiment with his own objects!


**Show Image 2A-7: Anton’s microscope**

Upon his return to Holland, Anton began to

build his own single-lens microscopes, ~~_or a_~~

~~_type of microscope having only one lens._~~ He

shaped his lenses very carefully, grinding them

down with sand and polishing them smooth





with putty, ~~_or polishing powder._~~ Anton’s simple

microscopes magnified objects from fifty to

two hundred times their natural size.



**26**


**Show Image 2A-8: Mosquitos under a**
**microscope**

Using the microscopes he made himself, he

studied people’s skin, mosquito wings, and

sheep hairs. He observed duck hearts, fish

scales, cow eyes, and water bugs. What a

strange man, others thought. But this patient

man was driven by his curiosity, and he wanted



to learn more. He never lost interest in the scales on a gnat’s wing or the

hairs on a fly. He looked at the same things again and again—comparing,

measuring, and recording his findings.


**Show Image 2A-9: Pond water under a**
**microscope**

Anton conducted many experiments with

water—drinking water from his well, water from

lakes and from the sea, rain, and melted snow.

He discovered what looked to him like tiny





“little animals” in lake water. He called these

“little animals” _animalcules_ . Anton claimed



he saw even more animalcules swimming about in rainwater. They were

everywhere, he said. He estimated ~~_or guessed_~~ that one thousand of these

tiny creatures could fit on the head of a pin. ~~_[Show Image Card 1 (Pins).] What_~~

~~_do you use a pin for? (_~~ _sewing)_ ~~_The head of the pin is the flat top part._~~ People

called him a liar and a magician, thinking him quite mad, ~~_or crazy._~~


But, in fact, Anton was not mad at all. His “little animals” were not really

animals, but they were definitely alive. He was the first to observe and describe

many tiny living things in nature not visible with the naked eye, including

**bacteria**, or germs. In other words, bacteria cannot be seen with the naked

eye. ~~_When something cannot be seen with the naked eye, it means you can’t see_~~

~~_the object with just your eyes. You need a tool, such as a microscope, telescope,_~~

~~_or magnifying glass, in order to see it._~~ These tiny life forms surround us in

air, water, and on land, but no one was aware of their existence before Anton

recorded what he saw. He discovered a whole new world!

word _mad_ is used

Lesson 2 Anton van Leeuwenhoek
**27**


**Show Image 2A-10: Close-up of a smile**

Ever curious, Anton began studying the

saliva from inside his mouth. He discovered

even more bacteria. He found that the sticky

coating on the outside of his teeth was

crawling with millions of tiny organisms, ~~_or_~~

~~_living things._~~ You have them too, but don’t

worry. They won’t hurt you. We’ll learn more

about them another day.


**Show Image 2A-11: Engraving of Anton from**
**the Royal Society**

Anton kept a journal to record his detailed

observations. He made friends with two English

doctors who belonged to England’s Royal

Society of London. They told him that their

fellow English scientists kept similar journals

to share their scientific discoveries, and they

invited Anton to share his work with them.



So, for the next fifty years, Anton sent hundreds of letters to England. His

letters described in great detail the tiny structures that he saw through his

homemade microscopes. He described fungus on stale bread; the stingers,

eyes, and mouths of bees; even tiny lice. Because he could not draw well,

Anton hired someone to illustrate his writing. The English society loved

everything he sent and published his letters for others to read.


**Show Image 2A-12: A microscope today and**
**Anton’s microscope**

Anton van Leeuwenhoek did not invent the

microscope, nor was he the first to use one,

but he used his own simple microscope more

than most people of his day. Compared to





modern microscopes, Anton’s was very simple,

indeed. It was even more simple than other



**28**



microscopes used in his day. The entire instrument was only three to four

inches long and had to be held up close to the eye.


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition


Anton’s microscope used only one lens. Modern microscopes have two or

more lenses—one in the eyepiece that you look through; and at least one

lens at the bottom of the tube, or barrel, to enlarge things even more.


Today, objects are put on glass slides to be viewed. These objects remain

in one place. It is the lens that moves, not the objects. Instead of keeping

the objects in one place, Anton mounted his objects on the end of a sharp

pointed pin sticking up in front of the lens and moved the objects instead

of the lens. Anton’s invention required good lighting and great patience to

use. His lenses were the clearest and most powerful lenses of his day, but he

never shared his secret for creating them. No one came close to matching

the quality of Anton van Leeuwenhoek’s microscopes for more than one

hundred years after his death. Of the four to five hundred microscopes that

Anton is believed to have made, no more than nine exist today.


**Show Image 2A-13: E. coli under a**
**microscope**

Anton is one of my heroes because he was the

first person to describe bacteria, tiny living

things not visible with the naked eye. And his

discovery of bacteria made it possible to see





other small living things, such as the small

building blocks of all life on Earth.



As a nutritionist, I am fascinated by how the human body works and the tiny

building blocks that make up the human body. The next time we meet, I look

forward to teaching you about the amazing body’s amazing building blocks.

rephrase students’ responses: “My main observation is that . . . ”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I am going to read some
sentences from the Read-Aloud. If the sentence describes one of Anton’s
observations, say, “That’s an observation.” If it does not describe one of
Anton’s observations, say, “That’s not an observation.” Remember to answer
in complete sentences.


  - At sixteen, Anton began working in the textile business. _(That’s not an_
_observation.)_


  - Anton used a magnifying glass to make sure that the threads of the cloth
were straight and tightly woven. _(That’s an observation.)_


  - Anton found that the sticky coating on the outside of his teeth was crawling
with millions of tiny organisms. _(That’s an observation.)_


  - Anton discovered what looked to him like tiny “little animals” in lake water.
_(That’s an observation.)_


  - Anton made friends with two English doctors who belonged to England’s
Royal Society of London. _(That’s not an observation.)_

human body. Nick Nutri mentioned cells at the end of the last Read-Aloud.


  - Explain that cells are the smallest units of all living things, not just of the
human body. Cells are so small they cannot be seen without a microscope.


  - Refer students to the name of today’s Read-Aloud, “Cells and Tissues.” Tell
them they are going to learn about cells and groups of cells.

Today we are going to talk about **cells** . When you hear the word _cell_, what is

the first thing that comes to your mind?


**Show Image 3A-1: Nick Nutri holding a cell**
**phone**

It may be that you think of a cell phone like

this. Telephone companies divide cities, towns,

and countrysides into lots of separate areas

in order to provide the best service. Each area





is called a cell. That’s why mobile ~~_or moveable_~~

phones are called cell phones. They use

signals from lots of different cells.



Image Card 2



What do you remember about the hives of honeybees? ~~_[Show Image Card 2_~~

~~_(Bee Hive).]_~~ Their hives are made up of lots of different areas called _cells_, too.

Different activities occur in each cell. Another example that might help us

understand cells would be a large multi-floor school building that has many

classrooms. A teacher is in each classroom, similar to cells lined up one after

the other inside beehives. The word _cell_ describes one of many small parts

that form a much larger area. One classroom is like one cell of many cells, or

rooms, in a school, like a honeybee’s cell is one of many cells in a hive. ~~_But_~~

~~_unlike the cells of a beehive, the cells of living things are too small to be seen_~~

~~_without the aid of a microscope._~~


**TEKS 2.6.G** Evaluate details read to determine key ideas; **TEKS 2.3.B** Use context within and beyond a sentence to determine
the meaning of unfamiliar words.


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition



**38**


Because you’re learning about the human body, you may have guessed that

we’re not going to be talking about cell phones or honeybees today! Instead,

we will focus on human body cells. These cells were a mystery to people for

thousands of years. No one even knew they existed. The invention of the

microscope changed all of that.


Microscopes magnify cells, making them big enough for the human eye to see.


Last time, I mentioned a man whose book of **microscopic** organisms, or

living things, influenced the work of Anton van Leeuwenhoek.


**Show Image 3A-2: A view of Hooke’s cork**
**cells**

The man was an Englishman named Robert

Hooke. In one of Hooke’s first experiments

with a microscope, he sliced open the stem of

a cork plant and placed it under his lens. ~~_[Show_~~



Challenge


Have students explain
why the invention of the
microscope may have
changed all that.


Image Card 3


Support


Review the meaning of
the word _microscopic_ .





~~_Image Card 3 (Cork Tree and Cork Board).]_~~

~~_You are probably familiar with corkboards or_~~



~~_bulletin boards made with cork. Cork comes from cork trees._~~ What he saw

amazed him. The cork was made up of tiny walled spaces. These little boxes

reminded him of the cells in a honeycomb. Hooke was the first to use the

term _cell_ to describe what he saw through the microscope. We still use the

word _cell_ today when referring to these tiny little boxes of which all living

things, both plants and animals, are made.


**Show Image 3A-3: Giraffe with an oxpecker**

All living things, no matter how big or how

small, are made up of microscopic units called

_cells_ . Cells are the body’s building blocks, the

smallest units of life that can carry out the

**functions**, ~~_or jobs,_~~ of a living thing. They are





so small that they cannot be seen without

the aid of a microscope. That is why we call

them microscopic.



The bacteria that Anton van Leeuwenhoek discovered are one-celled

organisms, but most living things on Earth have more than one cell. In fact,

some have billions of cells. You are one of those creatures. You have billions,

maybe even trillions, of cells.



Lesson 3 Cells and Tissues
**39**


**Show Image 3A-4 Cell division**

You began as a single cell formed by the

joining of two cells. Those two cells became

one joint cell. Then, that one cell divided into

two cells that divided into two more. The cells

divided again and again until pretty soon there

were billions, then trillions of cells. Your whole

body is made up of these tiny building blocks.


**Show Image 3A-5: Blood, muscle, and bone**
**cells**

The human body is a collection of more than

two hundred different types of cells. Cells

come in all shapes and sizes, depending upon

the jobs, ~~_or functions,_~~ they must perform.

Bone cells build bone. Skin cells build skin.

And guess what muscle cells build? Muscles!



The shape of a cell usually reflects the role it plays in the day-to-day working

of the human body. For example, red blood cells are shaped somewhat

like donuts without a hole. This allows them to flow smoothly through your

veins as part of your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to

your cells and carbon dioxide from your cells to your lungs. Your blood also

transports nutrients absorbed from food. ~~_What are nutrients?_~~ ~~(nourishing~~

~~substances necessary for growth and the maintenance of life~~ ~~_)_~~


**Show Image 3A-6: Nerve cell**

Nerve cells have short spiky branches on the

cell body to receive messages and a long tail

to send messages quickly to the next nerve

cell. See all the little branches and the long tail

on this nerve cell? ~~_[Point to the branches of the_~~





~~_nerves in the image.]_~~


Cells are like tiny chemical factories.



Support


Have students define
the term _factory_ and
give examples, such
as a toy factory, a car
factory, etc.



Because they are living organisms, they need nutrients and air to stay alive.

Your heart pumps blood to cells throughout your body, carrying food and

oxygen to each cell. Your cells use these nutrients to form muscles, nerves,

skin, and bone, and to help protect your body from disease.


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition



**40**


Living things do not last forever. Body cells have limited lives. Some cells get

damaged when you get hurt. Others wear out over time. As cells die, the dead

cells are replaced with new cells on a daily basis. Isn’t that amazing?


**Show Image 3A-7: Microscopic section of**
**skin**

Let’s look closely at a microscopic section of

skin. Skin cells are packed tightly together

to form a protective boundary ~~_or dividing line_~~

between you and your environment. ~~_How does_~~





~~_this image help you understand what is going on_~~

~~_in this part of the Read-Aloud?_~~ Do you see the



layers of cells, stacked one on top of the other? The older cells form a protective

layer for the new cells that are constantly growing beneath. They grow, split,

make new cells, and die. Some cells live for only a few days. Others live for years.


Cells work together. They are organized into groups of cells that all perform

the same function. ~~_What does_~~ ~~function~~ ~~_mean?_~~ ~~(job or purpose)~~ These groups

of cells are called **tissue** . Tissue is a collection of the same kinds of cells

working together to do the same job.


There are four main types of tissue, and each type serves a different

function. The four types of tissue are connective, muscle, nervous, and

epithelial [/ep* ə *thee*lee* ə l/].


**Show Image 3A-8: Skeleton and circulatory**
**system**

What do you think connective tissue does? It

connects. Connective tissue supports the body

and binds other tissue together like glue. Your

skeleton is made up of bone, a connective tissue



Support


Tissue can also be a
piece of soft and very
thin paper that is used
especially for blowing
your nose.





that provides the structure or framework for

your body. It contains cells that make the tissue



strong and flexible, ~~_or is able to bend easily without breaking._~~ These cells are called

ligaments, which are the tissues that connect bone to bone. Fat is a connective

tissue, padding your body and supplying it with energy. You may be surprised to

learn that blood is also a connective tissue, but think about it. This liquid tissue

flows throughout your entire body and connects all of its many parts.


Lesson 3 Cells and Tissues
**41**


**Show Image 3A-9: Muscle tissue**


Muscle tissue helps your body move. It is the

softest and most abundant tissue in your

body. ~~_[Point to the image.] You can see how_~~

~~_much muscle tissue there is throughout the_~~

~~_whole human body._~~ There are different kinds

of muscle tissue. Your stomach walls are

lined with smooth muscle tissue that helps



digest your food. Cardiac muscle is another muscle type. You would not be

alive without cardiac muscle tissue. What does the cardiac muscle do? It is

found only in your heart, and its job is to pump your blood. Skeletal muscle

tissue moves your bones. The long, thin strands of muscle tissue lengthen

and shorten in response to messages from your brain. As they shorten, they

move the parts of your body. So, connective tissue connects and muscle tissue

moves your body parts.


**Show Image 3A-10: Nervous tissue**

The third type of body tissue is nervous

tissue. Maybe you can figure out what it does

based on its name. What does it do? Nervous

tissue runs through your body and connects

to your brain. Nervous tissue serves as the





messengers between your brain and body.

Nerve cells within the nervous tissue sense



**42**



a **stimulus** and carry electrical signals to and from the brain. ~~_A stimulus_~~

~~_is a thing that starts other actions. Examples of a stimulus include a light,_~~

~~_a sound, a touch, etc._~~ Nervous tissue acts as the body’s most important

communication system. One example of how nervous tissue works would be

when you touch something that is so sharp that you would hurt yourself. Your

nervous tissue receives the stimulus of pain, the message is sent to your

brain, and your brain sends a message back to the nervous tissue to tell your

muscle tissue to jerk your hand away from the sharp stimulus. This happens

almost automatically without you having to think about it.


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition


**Show Image 3A-11: Bacteria repelled by**
**epithelial tissue**

What about epithelial tissue? Let’s try to

pronounce it first. Ep- ə -THEE-lee- ə l. What a

big word for tissue that covers and protects!

Sheets of cells, packed closely together, make

up epithelial tissue. Does this picture look

familiar? Remember, those are the skin cells



that form the outer layer of your skin. You’re looking at the epithelial tissue

that prevents bacteria from entering your body. This thin, tough covering

protects your body and its organs. Epithelial tissue is also found inside your

body. It forms barriers to protect the inside of your mouth, nose, throat,

and stomach.


**Show Image 3A-12: Cells, tissue, and ?**







Everything you do, from breathing to eating to

running, requires lots of working cells. They

are truly the building blocks of your body. Cells

are organized into tissues, grouped by the

similar jobs that they do. Tissues are organized

into groups that work together to do similar

jobs as well. You will learn all about these

groups of tissues the next time we’re together.

3. Functions are the roles, jobs, or purposes that support particular activities.


4. Some of the functions that trees provide are releasing oxygen to and
absorbing carbon dioxide from the air we breathe, giving shade and cooling,
serving as a habitat for animals, and supplying the resource of wood.


5. Think of some functions that schools serve. Tell us about one of them. Use
the word _functions_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If
necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses: “Schools serve many
functions, including . . . ”


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a True-False activity for follow-up.** I am going to read some sentences
about the functions of different human body systems. If what I read
describes one of the body system’s functions correctly, say, “That’s one of
its functions.” If it does not describe one of the body system’s functions,
say, “That’s not one of its functions.” Remember to answer in complete
sentences.


 - The circulatory system circulates blood through the heart to every part of the
body. _(That’s one of its functions.)_


 - The nervous system gets rid of our body waste. _(That’s not one of its_

**of the progression of cells, tissues, and ?**

~~_[Review the progression with students and ask_~~
~~_them to predict what will be the next category in_~~
~~_this progression.]_~~

In the last Read-Aloud you learned about

cells and tissues. Similar cells join together

in groups to form tissues. In the same way,



similar tissues join together to form organs. Organs are parts of the human

body that perform special jobs for the body. Organs are made up of groups

of tissues. All organs are made up of different kinds of tissues that help them

do their particular jobs well. ~~**TEKS 2.6.C**~~


Can anyone name one of your body organs?


**Show Image 4A-2: Eye, heart, lungs, and**
**stomach**

Your eyes and ears are organs. Your heart and

lungs are organs. Your stomach is an organ,

too. Which of your body organs is the largest?

It’s your skin! Does that surprise you? You’ve





looked at skin cells through the microscope,

and we’ve talked about the epithelial tissue



that these cells form. So, while it may seem odd to think of skin as an organ,

it does make sense, doesn’t it? Strong epithelial tissue, also made up of tiny

cells, forms an organ with a very large protective covering, the skin.


**TEKS 2.6.C** Make and correct or confirm predictions using text features, characteristics of genre, and structures;

**Show Image 4A-3: Four types of tissue**
**(epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous**

You’ve learned about four different types of

body tissues. What are the names of all four

types of body tissues? One is epithelial, the

tissue that forms your skin. What are the other

three? The other three are connective, muscle,

and nervous tissue. Each different type of tissue is made up of similar cells

that do the same jobs. All body tissues are made up of cells. And all body

organs are made up of tissues. Cells. Tissues. Organs. ~~_[Illustrate this concept_~~

~~_by drawing three concentric circles. On the innermost circle, write the word_~~

~~cells~~ ~~_. On the middle circle, write the word_~~ ~~tissues~~ ~~_. And on the outer circle_~~

~~_write the word_~~ ~~organs~~ ~~_.]_~~


The systems of the human body are organ systems. ~~_What are systems?_~~ ~~(sets~~

~~of connected parts that work together to perform a job)~~ An organ is a part of

the body with a clearly defined function, or job, to perform. Most organs are

involved in just one body system. There are ten major organ systems in the

human body.


**Show Image 4A-4: Muscular system and**
**skeletal system**

What body systems are in charge of helping

you move? You may have learned last year

about the skeletal and muscular systems. Your

skeletal system is made up of bones and other







organs. Its skeletal tissues work together with

the muscle tissues in your muscular system to

make your body move.


**Show Image 4A-5: Circulatory system,**
**nervous system, and respiratory system**

What does the circulatory system do? It

circulates, or moves, your blood around to all

parts of your body.


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition


Your heart, blood vessels, and blood, made up of cells and tissues, are the

organs of your circulatory system. The respiratory system includes your

lungs and airways—organs made up of cells and tissues—that help you

breathe. What does the nervous system do? It sends messages along the

spinal cord to the brain. The nerves, spinal cord, and brain, are organs made

up of nervous tissues, full of tiny nerve cells.


**Show Image 4A-6: Digestive system**

Which organ system includes your stomach?

Yes, it is the digestive system. Your stomach

works closely with other organs, each made up

of different types of tissues and different types





of cells to perform different types of jobs.

Soon, you will be able to name all of the other

organs that work together with your stomach



to help digest, or break down, your food.


Remember that your organs are a combination of different types of tissue.


The stomach is one of those organs. It is made up of many layers, including

all four main types of tissue. These tissues play a very important role in

the digestion of your food. We’ll take a quick peek at part of your digestive

system now. Let’s look at the inside of your stomach to see where these four

types of stomach tissue live.


**Show Image 4A-7: Cross-section of the**
**stomach**

From inside to outside, the first layer of tissue

that you see is epithelial tissue. ~~_[Point to the_~~

~~_relevant layers in the image as you read about_~~

~~_them, moving from the outside to the inside of_~~



Support


Review the four types
of tissue: connective,
muscle, nervous, and
epithelial.





~~_the stomach.]_~~ Remember what epithelial tissue

does? It is tightly packed, arranged in a layered



sheet to cover and protect the organ. Beneath the epithelial tissue is primarily

blood in tiny tubes, called capillaries, that carries—or connects—nutrients to

the cells. ~~_What are nutrients?_~~ ~~(nourishing substances necessary for growth~~

~~and the maintenance of life)~~ Smooth muscle tissue is sandwiched between

layers of epithelial tissue and helps to move food around in the stomach.

Stomach muscles squeeze together about three times per minute, continuing

to squeeze whether there is food in your stomach or not. It is the squeezing


Lesson 4 Organs
**53**


of these muscles that produces the loud rumbling noise you sometimes hear

when your stomach is nearly empty. The fourth type of body tissue, nervous

tissue, is located in the stomach wall. It constantly sends signals to the brain

and makes sure that all other parts are working smoothly.


Every organ in your body depends upon other organs to work in the right

way. When you study the digestive system more thoroughly in the next

lesson, you will see that the stomach could not perform the job of the entire

system on its own. It needs help.


**Show Image 4A-8: Nick Nutri pointing out**
**the liver**

Have you ever heard of the **liver** ? Your liver

is an organ located above your stomach that

your stomach depends upon to do its job.

Together with two other organs, known as

the pancreas and the gallbladder, the liver

produces digestive juices to help break down

your food. Your liver is one of the largest organs of the body, working as

part of several different systems to perform different body functions. You

cannot live without your liver. Next time, you will learn more about the very

important role that the liver plays in the digestive system.


Organs depend on one another. So do the body’s systems. Each system

depends upon the other systems to make sure that your body works

properly.


**Show Image 4A-9: The circulatory,**
**respiratory, digestive, and muscular systems**

For example, blood is carried to all parts of

your body through the circulatory system.

The circulatory system depends upon the

respiratory system to get oxygen into the





bloodstream. Your blood would have no

nutrients in it without the help of the digestive



**54**



system to break down your food and remove waste from your body. Working

together, these different systems provide your cells with the food and oxygen

they need so that energy can be supplied to all your other systems. Without

energy, your muscles couldn’t move your bones; without energy, your brain

could not think.


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition


When organs stop working properly, body systems break down. The body

stops functioning well and you become ill. If someone’s lungs **collapse**, ~~_or_~~

~~_cave in_~~ there is not enough oxygen to feed, or **nourish**, their cells with the

things they need to live and grow because air has gotten between their lung

and the chest wall. When someone’s heart stops, it will no longer pump blood

with the necessary nutrients to other parts of their body. When you’re doing

things like riding your bike, or playing certain sports, it’s very important to

protect your head by wearing a helmet. A head injury might result in damage

to the brain, and this might prevent messages from going back and forth

between the brain, the nervous system, and other parts of the body.


**Show Image 4A-10: Kidneys**

A donor is a person who donates, or gives,

something. Have you ever heard of an organ

donor? Believe it or not, an organ donor gives

away an organ to save another person’s life.

Fortunately, modern science has made it





possible to replace damaged organs.


Sometimes when people are very ill, but still



have healthy body organs, they decide to donate their healthy organs to

others when they die. Sometimes it is even possible for people to spare an

organ and go on living healthy lives themselves. For example, you have two

**kidneys** . Kidneys are a pair of organs located in your lower back. You will

learn more about these two very important organs in another lesson. Your

kidneys clean poisonous waste from the blood flowing through the body,

preventing many different types of disease. You can live a healthy life with

only one kidney, so this is one organ that can be donated to someone who

needs a kidney. Doctors today can take a kidney from one person’s body and

**transplant**, or move, it into another person’s body to keep them alive if the

person’s kidney is a match. Doesn’t that sound amazing? I think so.

may be a sensitive or

~~**“THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 5A-1: The digestive system**

Ah, boys and girls, when I look at you I can’t

tell whether you are hungry or whether you

have just had a meal. But one thing I do know

is that everybody in this room has a digestive

system and that all of your digestive systems

are working right now. There is a lot going on

inside those bodies of yours!


You each eat several hundred pounds of food in one year. It takes roughly

twenty hours for food to travel through your gut, or digestive tract, a long,

complicated series of tunnels with openings at both ends. Where does the

journey begin? Yes, the process ~~_or series of steps_~~ of digestion begins when

you put a piece of food in your mouth.


**Show Image 5A-2: Toothless baby**

When you were born, most of your teeth

were hiding inside your gums. That’s why

babies start out with a liquid diet. ~~_A liquid diet_~~

~~_is nutrition you can drink. Babies start out_~~

~~_drinking their food, which is mainly milk._~~ But





once your first set of teeth came in, you were

able to eat solid foods. You are at an age right

speaking when recognized, making appropriate contributions, and building on the ideas of others; **TEKS 2.6.B** Generate

Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition


now when you are probably losing some of those teeth and getting a new set.

If so, maybe you are finding it hard to chew certain foods.


Your teeth help you break your food down into tiny pieces. The longer you

chew, the smaller the pieces become, and the easier it is to digest.


**Show Image 5A-3: Teeth**

Human teeth come in different shapes and

sizes, designed to eat both plants and animals.

Let’s take a look at the different types of teeth

you have in your mouth. The flat, wedge-shaped

teeth at the front of your mouth are called





incisors. ~~_The incisors are thicker at one end_~~

~~_than the other, similar to a piece of pie. [Point to_~~



~~_the incisors on the image.]_~~ The incisors, both top and bottom, work together

like a pair of scissors to bite, slice, and cut up your food. Next to the incisors

are sharp, fang-like teeth called canines, or dogs’ teeth. These teeth tear and

rip food apart, the way that dogs do with a piece of meat. Behind the canines,

bicuspids help to crush the food. In the back of the mouth, wide teeth with

bumpy tops known as molars help grind the food into mush. ~~_With your tongue,_~~

~~_touch the teeth in your mouth. Do you notice the different shapes your teeth_~~

~~_have?_~~ Next time you bite into a piece of chicken, sample a piece of cheese, or

chomp into an apple, see if you can tell which teeth help you the most.


**Show Image 5A-4: Salivary glands**

Have you ever heard someone call food

“mouthwatering”? What do you think that

means? When you smell your favorite food,

perhaps spaghetti and meatballs, your mouth

probably starts to water as you think about





how good it will taste. That watery substance is

called **saliva** . Saliva comes from small salivary



glands ~~_or organs_~~ in your cheek and under your tongue. It helps keep your

mouth damp and softens food as you chew, beginning to break food down for

easy digestion. Saliva serves another important job as well, helping to wash

away and kill bacteria. ~~_What is another word for unwanted bacteria?_~~ ~~(germs)~~


Did you know that every day you produce as many as six cups of saliva in

your mouth?


Can you feel it? Can you taste it?


What else do you have in your mouth besides your teeth and saliva?



Support


Explain that germs
are everywhere.


Support


Show students the
container with six
cups of liquid.



Lesson 5 The Digestive System
**69**


**Show Image 5A-5: Upper digestive system**

What’s the name of that fleshy muscle in your

mouth that is covered in taste buds? ~~_Taste_~~

~~_buds are clusters of nerve endings._~~ Your

tongue, of course! Not only does your tongue

help you taste your food, it also helps push

the food around your mouth, rolling it into a

mashed up, wet lump of food.



**70**



Your tongue pushes the lump of food to the back of your mouth and helps

you swallow. Once food is swallowed, it passes into a food canal called the

**esophagus** . This stretchy tube is only about ten inches long, leading from

the back of your throat, through your neck and chest, to your stomach.

Food passes through the esophagus quickly. Muscles squeeze together and

push the food into the stomach in about ten seconds or less. It’s a lot like

squeezing toothpaste from its tube.


**Show Image 5A-6: Middle digestive system**

Put your hand on the left side of your upper

abdomen, just below your chest and above

your waist. That’s where your stomach lives,

behind your lower ribs. This human mixing

machine is shaped a bit like the letter ‘J’. Your

stomach acts like a balloon, expanding to hold

the food it receives. The stomach’s gastric

juices help break down the food into a paste-like substance. These digestive

juices also kill any germs that may have been swallowed. Round and round

food churns for three to four hours as muscles squeeze inside the stomach

walls. Once it is the substance of a thick soup, the food continues its journey

into the intestines.


**Show Image 5A-7: Lower digestive system**

There are two types of intestines—the small

intestine and the large intestine. The intestines

are tubes located in the lower abdomen

through which food and food waste travel.

Even though there are two different kinds of

intestines—the small and the large intestines,

they are actually part of the same, long,

single tube. A muscular gate at the bottom


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition


of the stomach opens to allow food to flow from the stomach into the small

intestine. The small intestine is about twenty-one feet long, or about as long

as five seven-year-olds lying head to toe. Even though it’s longer than the large

intestine, it’s called the small intestine because it’s much thinner than the

large intestine. This narrow tube, the small intestine, is coiled up like a snake

below your belly button. Muscles squeeze together and push the mashed-up
soupy liquid along the curly, small intestine. The food is mixed once more with

digestive juices from the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder, other organs that are

part of your digestive system. The juices, called enzymes, break the food down

and make it more and more watery along the way.









**Show Image 5A-8: Cross section of the small**
**intestine**

The small intestine, with its millions of **villi**, or

finger-like threads, is where some of the most

important work of the digestive system takes

place. ~~_[Point to the villi on the image.]_~~ The

villi **absorb**, or soak up, usable nutrients and

water, passing them through the bloodstream



into all the cells of your body. Did you ever hear rumbling sounds coming

from inside you? Chances are they are coming from your small intestine as

muscles contract, or squeeze together, to break down food. They are the

sounds of a healthy gut!


**Show Image 5A-9: The role of the liver in the**
**digestive process**

Most of the nutrients that are absorbed by the

small intestine’s many villi travel in the blood

to the reddish-purplish liver, one of your body’s

important cleansing organs. ~~_What does it mean_~~

~~_when something is absorbed?_~~ ~~(It is soaked up.)~~

Your lower ribs on the right side of your body

protect your liver. Its function is to clean the blood, **filtering**, or straining out,

any leftover waste. It turns this waste into bile, one of the juices used by the

small intestine to help digest your food. The clean blood, with lots of nutrients,

is carried to muscles to make them stronger, to bones to make them harder,

and to every other part of your body to give you energy to help you grow. Since

blood goes to every part of your body, the liver performs a very important

function of making sure the blood circulating in your body is clean.


Lesson 5 The Digestive System
**71**


**Show Image 5A-10: The appendix**

~~_[Point to the image of the appendix.]_~~ This finger
shaped organ is called the appendix. As far as

anyone knows, it doesn’t seem to be useful to the

digestive system. From time to time, the appendix

can become infected with harmful germs and

cause a disease called appendicitis. When people

get appendicitis, they get a very sharp pain in the



**72**



lower abdomen in the area surrounding the intestines. The pain comes from the

appendix, located in the lower right side of your abdomen, near your hip bone.

When it causes too much pain, doctors remove it. For many years, the appendix

was considered a completely useless organ. Only recently have some doctors

begun to think that the appendix may serve to fight infections, ~~_or kill germs._~~


**Show Image 5A-11: Lower digestive system**

The appendix is located right where the small

intestine widens out into the large intestine.

The large intestine is where the solid waste

is produced. ~~_The main function of the large_~~

~~_intestine is absorption of water and waste_~~

~~_elimination._~~ Even though the large intestine is

much, much shorter than the small intestine, it

is called the large intestine because it is much wider. Parts of food not digested

in the small intestine are squeezed out into the large intestine where they

remain for up to two days. Water is absorbed from the waste into the walls

of the large intestine and passed into the bloodstream. The waste becomes

thicker and thicker, piling up into a solid mass until it moves out of the body.


**Show Image 5A-12: The digestive system**

~~_[Point to each of the relevant digestive organs_~~

~~_as you read about it.]_~~ That is the end of your

food’s journey—from mouth to esophagus to

stomach to small intestine to large intestine

and out of the body. ~~_How does this image help_~~

~~_you understand this part of the Read-Aloud?_~~

The digestive system’s organs are working

all the time, day and night, to process food

into substances that your body can use, providing you with the nutrients and

energy you need.

Check for Understanding


**Identification:** [Show Image 5A-12. Have students take turns
pointing to the organs in the digestive system and identifying
each organ.]


1. **Inferential.** You learned that both saliva and gastric juices work to kill
germs. Why is that necessary? How do germs get into your body? _(Germs_
_are everywhere, and it is impossible not to breathe them through the air and_
_ingest them with our food.)_


2. **Inferential.** You learned that the liver filters waste from your blood. Why is it
important to have clean blood? _(Blood travels to all parts of your body, and it_
_would not be good to have waste circulating through the body.)_


3. **Evaluative.** _What? Pair-Share:_ Think of a question you could ask your
neighbor about the Read-Aloud that starts with the word _what_ . For example,
you could ask, “What organ filters the blood?” Turn to your neighbor and ask
your _what_ question. Listen to your neighbor’s response. Then your neighbor
will ask a new question and you will get a chance to respond. I will call on
several of you to share your questions with the class. ~~**TEKS 2.1.D**~~

~~**WORD WORK: ABSORB (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “The villi absorb usable nutrients and water,
passing them through the bloodstream into all the cells of your body.”


2. Say the word _absorb_ with me.


3. _Absorb_ means to soak in a substance.


4. The paper towel will absorb the spilled water.


5. Think of a material that will absorb, or soak up, a substance easily. Use the
word _absorb_ or _absorbed_ when you tell about a time you saw this happen.

[Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’
responses: “The grass absorbed  ”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I am going to name
two words. You need to respond with a simple sentence, saying
“ absorbs,” using the words in the correct order. For example, if
I said, “pancakes” and “syrup,” you would respond, “Pancakes absorb syrup,”
because syrup is soaked up by the pancakes, not the other way around.
Remember to use the word _absorbs_ : “ absorbs .”


 - roots/rainwater _(Roots absorb rainwater.)_


 - leaves/sunlight _(Leaves absorb sunlight.)_


 - urine/diapers _(Diapers absorb urine.)_


 - towels/bathwater _(Towels absorb bathwater.)_

Humans are exposed to low levels of different

may take in toxins through the air or through the

food that you eat. If these toxins hang around in

your body too long, they may become **toxic**, or

poisonous, to you. The amazing human body has

ways of getting rid of these toxins before they become harmful.


The last time we met, you learned how your digestive system works to

process food into usable nutrients, separating the nutrients from the waste

materials including any toxic substances. ~~_What are nutrients?_~~ At the end

of the digestive process, some food is not completely broken down by the

intestines. ~~_What are the intestines?_~~ This leftover solid waste is pushed out of

your body at the end of the digestive system.


Now that we’ve learned about how the body processes solid waste, you may

be wondering what happens to the body’s liquid waste. Where does it go?

Some waste leaves your body through your skin. Other waste is processed

through a system like the digestive system. Just as the digestive system

processes solid waste, there is a system that processes liquid waste. It

is called the excretory system. To **excrete** means to expel, or get rid, of

something that is not needed. Excess water, waste, and toxins, or poisons,

are definitely not needed in your body.

Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition


**Show Image 6A-2: Sweat**

Let’s begin by talking about the liquid waste

that leaves the body through your skin. We call

it **sweat** . What is another name for sweat? It is

also called perspiration. You already know that

your skin is the largest body organ. It covers

your entire body surface. Sweat glands below

the surface of the skin help rid the body of



waste through perspiration. When you perspire, water, salt, and other waste

flows out through these microscopic sweat glands. ~~_Are we able to see these_~~

~~_sweat glands?_~~ ~~(no)~~ ~~_What word in this sentence lets you know the sweat glands_~~

~~_are not visible to the naked eye?_~~ ~~(microscopic)~~ They are excreted from all

parts of your body.


The body’s main liquid waste is urine, sometimes called pee. Urine is cleaner

than spit. Unlike the saliva in your mouth, urine contains no bacteria. ~~_What_~~

~~_are bacteria?_~~ It is about ninety-six percent water and four percent waste.

This means that if urine were divided into one hundred parts, ninety-six parts

would be water, and only four parts would be waste. Like solid waste, this liquid

waste also passes through several different organs as it makes its journey

through your body. Today we will take a look at the organs that are a part of the

excretory system.


**Show Image 6A-3: The kidneys**

The kidneys are the primary organs of

excretion. Everybody, stand up for a minute

so that I can make sure that you know where

your kidneys are located. Let your arms hang

by your sides. Your kidneys are in line with

your elbows, at your back above your waist.

Reach around and place your hands just above

your waist on either side of your backbone. Your two kidneys hang near your

spine, one on either side of your backbone, in the middle of your back. Your

bottom ribs and layers of fat protect the kidneys. Do you have a pretty good

idea of where they live? Okay, let’s sit down and see how they work.


Arteries, or muscular tubes, carry blood from other parts of your body to

your kidneys. These two, dark red, bean-shaped organs act like a screen for

the blood, cleaning it of waste and toxins. As blood flows to your body’s cells,

it passes through the kidneys where millions of tiny microscopic filter tubes

capture the waste products and excess, or extra, water.


**Show Image 6A-4: Strainer**

Think of a kitchen strainer or sieve. ~~_[Point to_~~

~~_the strainer/sieve in the image.]_~~ Have you ever

seen cooked pasta poured into a strainer?

The liquid flows through, and the strainer

catches the pasta. Your kidneys act a little like



stretchy, sac-like muscle stores urine. It is a little like a water balloon with

three openings: the two ureters that connect to the kidneys, and a third

opening at the other end of the bladder called the urethra. As urine passes

into the bladder through the ureters, the walls stretch, and the rubbery

balloon begins to fill.


Nerve endings in the muscular bladder walls send signals to the brain that

the bladder is full. That’s when you know it is time to urinate. Urine passes

out of your body through the urethra, the tube at the bottom of the bladder.

Just like the small intestine at the bottom of the stomach, the urethra

has a muscular gate that opens and closes to let the urine pass. When the

muscular gate is tightened, urine stays in the bladder. When it is relaxed,

urine is released. This is a voluntary muscle, meaning that you are able to

control its opening and closing, but you need to listen to your brain when it

tells you that it is time to go to the bathroom. The excretory system works

the same for both boys and girls.


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition





that kitchen strainer. They filter, or separate,

the liquid waste from the blood. Clean blood



travels to your body’s cells, while the liquid waste, called urine, is collected in

each kidney.


**Show Image 6A-5: Diagram of kidneys,**
**ureters, bladder, and urethra**

Urine drains out of both kidneys through two

tubes called ureters. The ureters lead from the

kidneys to your urinary **bladder** . The bladder

is a muscular storage bag located in the lower





part of your abdomen, which is below your

waist. When it gets full, we can feel it. This



**84**


**Show Image 6A-6: Importance of drinking**
**water**

In addition to preparing liquid waste for

removal from the body, the kidneys also

**regulate**, or control, the amount of salt and

nutrients in the blood. They help to maintain

a state of balance in the body by controlling

the amount of water your body loses,



balancing the amount of water excreted with the amount of water kept in the

body. ~~_What does_~~ ~~excreted~~ ~~_mean?_~~ If you have too much water in the body, you

may feel bloated, or swollen. If there is too little water in the body, you may

become dehydrated, or dried out. Dehydration can cause serious damage to

your body. That is why it is important to drink lots of water, never letting your

body dry out.


Let’s name all of the different parts of the excretory system. The excretory

system is made up of the kidneys, the bladder, the two tubes that connect

them—the ureters—and the urethra, the final tube in the process. It may

appear less complicated than the digestive system, but it is just as important

for filtering the blood and helping your body get rid of toxic substances.


**Show Image 6A-7: Big and strong**

the body’s waste, but along the way you have

Your cells need nutrients to stay alive. Your tissues need nutrients to function

properly. Your organs stop working without the right nutrients, and if your

organs stop working, your body’s systems might stop working, too! ~~_What are_~~

~~_cells?_~~ ~~(the smallest units of living things; the body’s building blocks)~~ ~~_What is_~~

~~_tissue?_~~ ~~(a group of cells that perform the same jobs in living things)~~ ~~_What are_~~

~~_organs?_~~ ~~(groups of tissue that do a particular job for the body)~~ ~~_What is a body_~~

~~_system?_~~ ~~(a collection of organs that work together for the same purpose)~~


You know that nutrients are good for you. But what exactly are nutrients?

Nutrients are substances that provide nourishment necessary for the growth

and health of an organism. Providing the body with the nutrients it needs is

an **essential** ~~_or necessary_~~ part of staying healthy.


So, how do you get nutrients? Yes, from the food you eat. Nutritionists, like

me, think of the body as a chemical factory. Everything you eat is made up

of thousands of different chemical substances. The ones that every healthy

body needs to stay alive are called nutrients.


**Show Image 7A-3: Basic nutrients**

Everyone needs four basic nutrients—water,

**carbohydrates**, **proteins**, and **fats** .


These nutrients come from different food

sources. It is up to you to choose the right





foods to supply your bodies with the proper

balance of water, carbohydrates, proteins, and



fats. Today I am going to teach you how to make the best food choices for

maintaining a healthy body.


**Show Image 7A-4: A glass of water**

Let’s start with the nutrient that is familiar to

everybody: water. Water is perhaps the most

important nutrient of all. It is necessary for

all body functions. ~~_What’s another word for_~~

~~_functions?_~~ ~~(jobs or purpose)~~ You cannot live





for more than about a week without water. Did

you know that two-thirds of your body is made



up of water? Water is part of your blood. It travels in and out of your cells and

helps to dissolve other nutrients, carrying them to all your tissues. Water is a

necessary part of the excretory system, making up most of your urine. Water


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition


helps break down your food so that solid waste can pass from your body.

Water even helps maintain the right body temperature.


When given a choice of what to drink, water is always the healthiest choice

you can make. It is up to you to constantly refill your body’s supply of water.

You need between three and six cups each day, but not all of your water

needs to come from a cup.


**Show Image 7A-5: Sources of water in food**

Did you know that many foods contain lots of

water, too? Grapefruit, watermelon, tomatoes,

cucumber, and lettuce are all good choices.

One way to tell whether you are getting

enough water is to check the color of your







urine. It should be practically colorless.


**Show Image 7A-6: Carbohydrates**

All nutrients supply your body with energy,

but the body’s main source of energy comes

from carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are

found almost entirely in plant foods—fruits,

vegetables, whole grains, peas, and beans.

Potatoes, rice, and pasta are good choices for

carbohydrates. Milk and milk products, like



ice cream and yogurt, provide the body with carbohydrates, fat, and protein.

Cheese has only a few carbohydrates.


**Show Image 7A-7: Protein**

Protein is a body-builder and is contained in

all body cells. It is necessary for your body’s

growth and development, building muscle,

and helping to repair cells. It’s easy to see

how cells outside the body—like hair, skin,

Support

and nails—renew themselves, isn’t it? Each

time we cut them, they grow right back! The



body makes its own protein, but it needs the protein units from foods. Good

sources of protein include meat, milk, beans, peas, lentils, nuts, and seeds.


Lesson 7 Nutrients
**97**


**Show Image 7A-8: Fats**

The fourth nutrient that your body needs is

fat. ~~_What are the other three nutrients we just_~~

~~_discussed?_~~ ~~(water, carbohydrates, and protein)~~

Butter, margarine, and oils are good sources of fat.

It may seem strange to you that I am telling you to

include fat in your diet, but your body does need a

certain amount of fat. Does anyone know why?


Well, for one thing, fat is necessary for the development of your brain,

especially in the first few years of your life. When you looked at skin cells

under a microscope, do you remember seeing the layer of fat cells? A thin

layer of fat underneath your skin acts like a blanket, providing you with

insulation ~~_or protection_~~ and warmth. Fat stores energy in your body and helps

keep your skin healthy, too.


So, you see, fat is an important nutrient, but you only need very small

amounts of it. Your body can make most of its building blocks from

carbohydrates and proteins.


So far, you’ve learned that the body needs four basic nutrients to grow and

stay healthy. What are they? Great—water, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.


**Show Image 7A-9: Vitamins and food**

These are not the only nutrients your body

needs. There are other important nutrients that

are also essential to life. ~~_What does_~~ ~~essential~~

~~_mean?_~~ ~~(necessary or important)~~ They are

called vitamins and **minerals** . ~~_Minerals are_~~





~~_nonliving substances that you need in small_~~

~~_amounts to be healthy._~~ Your body needs less of



**98**



them than the other four nutrients, but if you don’t get enough vitamins and

minerals, you can become sick.


Long ago, sailors lived on a diet of only biscuits and salty meat while they

were out at sea. They began to suffer from bleeding gums, and their bones

became weak. Once they added lemons and limes to their diet, the sailors

became much better. Why do you think that is?


Citrus fruits, like lemons, limes, oranges, and grapefruits, gave the sailors

the Vitamin C that they needed to keep their blood vessels, gums, and teeth


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition


healthy. Vitamin C also helps build tissue and fight germs. That’s why your

mom or dad might give you extra orange juice if you feel like you’re catching

a cold. If you aren’t a fan of citrus fruits, broccoli and tomatoes are also good

choices to make sure you are getting enough Vitamin C.


**Show Image 7A-10: Vitamin alphabet**

Letters of the alphabet, like the letter ‘C,’ are

used for many vitamins. There’s Vitamin A,

Vitamin B, Vitamins C, D, and E—and so many

more! Vitamin A is important for healthy skin

and helps you see more clearly at night. Dairy





products, carrots, and dark, leafy greens

contain lots of Vitamin A.



There are many different B vitamins—Vitamin B1, Vitamin B2, Vitamin B3,

and so on. The B vitamins, found in meat, beans, and dark leafy greens help

the body perform lots of different functions. For example, B12 helps make

red blood cells. Vitamin D, found in fish and egg yolks, helps build strong

bones.


Most of the vitamins you need come from vegetables, fruits, and grains. All

vitamins are essential in small doses, or amounts. If you have a healthy diet,

you are probably getting all the vitamins you need.


**Show Image 7A-11: Fluoride**

Fluoride is a mineral that is often added to

public drinking water. It is contained in some

toothpaste and mouthwash as well. This is

because fluoride helps prevent tooth decay.

Your body needs small amounts of different





minerals, such as fluoride, to help perform

specific body functions. Besides fluoride, other

minerals include calcium, sodium, and iron.

Have students review
the six nutrients.



Lesson 7 Nutrients
**99**


**Show Image 7A-12: Sources of minerals**

You can help your teeth and bones stay strong

by eating foods rich in calcium. Milk, broccoli,

and almonds are good choices. Sodium—

found in table salt, bacon, and lots of soup

broths—helps regulate the body’s fluids. Then

again, too much salt is not good for you. It

causes the body to hold onto too much fluid,



**100**



which can cause high blood pressure. If you feel weak, look pale, and get tired

easily, you may need more iron. Eat more red meat, whole grains, and beans.

Iron helps the blood carry oxygen throughout the body and helps the body

fight infections.


Each one of these minerals provides important nutrients for your body. As

with vitamins, you can get most of the minerals you need by eating a healthy

diet. That’s what we will talk about next time we meet—the best foods for you

to eat!

meal of cereal, orange juice, and toast?

Pancakes loaded with butter and syrup with

a side of bacon or sausage? Perhaps you’d





choose a juicy hamburger with French fries

and slaw. What about pizza or shrimp lo mein?



Maybe you’d favor enchiladas or souvlaki? Or would you choose a fish taco

and tomato soup?


You each have different favorites, I’m sure. Hopefully, as you learn more

about nutrition and the nutrients your body needs, you will begin to think

more about what you eat, making wise choices so that you can maintain

a healthy body throughout your life. ~~_What are nutrients?_~~ ~~(nourishing~~

meant that I shouldn’t eat too much or too

little of any one thing. I love chocolate chip



cookies so much that I could easily eat a whole batch, but I had to learn to

eat slowly and be satisfied with one or two.


Balancing your diet with lots of different foods is important. Think about

all of the different nutrients your body needs. These nutrients come from

a variety of foods. A well-balanced diet includes grains, fruits, vegetables,

dairy, meats and fish, and fats.


**Show Image 8A-3: Grains**

Do you remember which one of the four

basic nutrients is contained in grains—

carbohydrates or fats? Right—carbohydrates.

Grains also contain small amounts of protein

and fats, but carbohydrates make up the





largest amount of nutrients in grains.


There is a lot of variety when it comes to



choosing a grain for dinner. Grains include rice, pasta, bread, and cereal.

Think of all the many types of pasta alone—spaghetti, macaroni, penne,

rigatoni—the list goes on and on. If you have a choice between brown rice

and white rice, brown contains more nutrients. The same is true of breads.

Whole wheat bread is better for you than white bread. When choosing a

cereal, find one that isn’t loaded with extra sugar.


Lesson 8 A Well-Balanced Diet
**111**


**Show Image 8A-4: Starch and sugar**

You learned that the body needs energy

and that most of its energy comes from

carbohydrates. That’s because the body

breaks down large carbohydrates, like the

starch in potatoes or spaghetti, into smaller

carbohydrates like sugar, which contains a lot

of energy that the body can use. Table sugar

comes from the roots and stems of plants, like sugar beets and sugarcane,

and will give you instant energy. But the kind of sugars found in potatoes and

pasta are much better for you than digging into the sugar bowl or reaching

for a candy bar. Both give you energy, but candy gives you a quick burst of

energy that is soon gone, whereas the energy in potatoes and pasta lasts

much longer because it is released into your body much more slowly. If

you’re hungry, a baked potato will satisfy your hunger much longer than a

handful of chocolate candy.


**Show Image 8A-5: Other carbohydrates**

What other foods are rich in carbohydrates?

Yes, fruits and vegetables—apples, bananas,

carrots, and broccoli. They all provide your

body with energy. Just like grains, the natural

breakdown of sugar from a fresh piece of fruit



of sweet corn over eating a teaspoonful of sugar from the sugar bowl. The next

time you go to the grocery store, **scan**, or look quickly around, the produce

section for some fruits and vegetables that you may not have tried. Have you

ever tried kohlrabi or kiwi fruit? Remember, variety is the spice of life.


**Show Image 8A-6: Sources of fiber**

In the lesson on the digestive system, you

learned that the body was not able to process

some foods and so they leave the body as

waste. **Fiber**, a very important carbohydrate,

is one kind of waste. Fiber is the part of plant





is far better for you than a hot-fudge sundae.

Choose a naturally sweet-tasting beet or an ear





foods that your body can’t digest or absorb.

Since your body cannot digest it, fiber is not



**112**



a nutrient, but a good diet should include lots of fiber to help keep things

moving along the digestive tract. Oranges, pears, berries, peas, and nuts will

give you the fiber that you need.


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition


**Show Image 8A-7: Sources of protein**

Meat, fish, eggs, and dairy are all good sources

of protein, and they are all animal products.

Some people are vegetarians, meaning that

they do not eat meat. And some people are

vegans, meaning they do not eat or use any

animal products, such as eggs, cheese, milk,

or meat. We know how important protein is



for the growth and repair of our bodies, so let’s discuss some ways that

everyone can get the protein they need. You might have scrambled eggs for

breakfast, hummus and pita bread for a snack, a turkey sandwich for lunch,

and a bowl of chili for dinner. All of those foods provide the protein that

your body needs. Some other good sources of protein include brown rice,

nuts, tofu, and yogurt. Just limit the sweetened, flavored varieties of yogurt

because of the added sugars. Nuts are rich in protein, too, as are all soybean

products, like tofu and soymilk.


**Show Image 8A-8: Fats**

Let’s not forget the fats in your well-balanced

diet. Meat and dairy products contain lots of

fat, and butter and oils are nearly a hundred

percent fat. Avocados, olives, nuts, and

seeds also contain a lot of fat, but they are





more healthy sources of fat. They are the

backup energy source when your body needs



a boost, but most of the fat you need is already stored in your body. Each

day, you only need the amount of fat contained in about one tablespoon of

vegetable oil to keep your body healthy. Many of us eat much more than

that. Fat is a little like sugar. It contains important nutrients, but they are

very few compared to other foods. Foods rich in vitamins, like fresh fruits

and vegetables, are a much better choice than greasy, fried foods made with

lots of fat. Too much fat can make you unhealthy and cause damage to your

circulatory system.

**Show Image 8A-9: Breakfast, the most**
**important meal of the day**

Have you ever heard that breakfast is the most

important meal of the day? Do you know why?


The word _breakfast_ means to _break the fast_ .

You fast, or don’t eat, every night when you

sleep. That’s a long time to go without food.

Both your body and your brain need to be



recharged in the morning, so you need to break the fast with breakfast.

Without food, you may feel tired and grumpy because you don’t have all the

energy you need to get going in the morning. You may stumble over math

problems, thinking five plus seven equals twenty, or skip over a line in your

reader so that your sentences are all mumbo-jumbo. ~~_The word_~~ ~~skip~~ ~~_as used in_~~

~~_this sentence means to miss something._~~


Think about starting every day with some healthy proteins and

carbohydrates so that both your body and your brain are at their best.


**Show Image 8A-10: The produce aisle**

Generally speaking, the fresher the food, the

better it is for you. That is why it makes sense

to spend more time in the produce aisle of the

grocery store. Processed foods often have lots

of added salts and sugars and are stripped





of the vitamins and minerals that your

body needs.



If you do choose packaged foods, make a habit of checking the labels on the

outside wrappers before adding them to your cart. Food labels tell how big a

serving is, which essential nutrients are provided, and the quantities of each

nutrient per serving.


It is important to limit the amount of food eaten that is high in sodium,

sugar or fat.


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition


**Show Image 8A-11: Sugar**

Check out the label from a can of soda. Did

you know that there are ten teaspoons of

sugar in one soda? Sodas have no nutritional

value, cause tooth decay, and put on unhealthy

pounds. What would be a better choice of

beverage? Water is always best, but milk and

fruit juices contain vitamins and minerals, so

they are good choices, too, in small amounts.


**Show Image 8A-12: Macaroni and cheese**
**or a salad?**

The next time you go to the grocery store,

look in your grocery cart and see if the foods

you’ve chosen are part of a well-balanced

diet. Remember to eat a variety of foods with

**Turn and Talk:** Turn to your neighbor and discuss why the author

of the Read-Aloud said _it makes sense to spend more time in the_

_produce aisle of the grocery store._ What facts did the author use

to support this statement?


[Have several students share their responses with the class.

_(Answers may vary, but may include that produce, or fresh fruits_

_and vegetables, are healthier options than processed foods; fresh_

_fruits and vegetables provide things such as fiber, carbohydrates,_

_and water; processed foods often have added salts and sugars, and_

_are stripped of vitamins and minerals; etc.)_ ]

1. **Inferential.** Pretend that you just ate a meal that consisted of fried fish, a
baked potato and butter, green beans, and a glass of milk. Which of the four
basic nutrients did you consume and from which foods? _(carbohydrates—_
_potato and green beans; protein—fish and milk; fats—butter or oil used to fry_
_the fish; water—milk, potatoes, and green beans)_


2. **Literal.** You learned that fiber—the part of fruits, vegetables, and grains that
cannot be digested and becomes body waste—is an important carbohydrate.
Why is fiber so important if the body cannot use it for nutrients? _(Fiber helps_
_food move more quickly through the digestive tract.)_


3. **Literal.** Vegetarians do not eat meat, and vegans do not eat any animal
products, including meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products. These foods are all
rich sources of protein, so how do vegetarians or vegans get the protein they
need? _(They combine grains and beans, nuts, and soy products to get all the_
_protein they need.)_

of the four basic nutrients will provide them with most of the energy they
need? _(carbohydrates)_


5. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ Pretend that for an after-school snack you
are offered soda, a bag of chips, a cup of almonds, a strawberry-flavored
carton of yogurt, and an apple. Which of these items is the healthiest for you,
and why? _(the apple and almonds; The apple provides energy and fiber with_
_natural sugars. The almonds are rich in protein and fiber.)_ Which of these
items is the least healthy for you, and why? _(The soda and yogurt have added_
_sugars, and the chips have added salt and fats.)_

~~**WORD WORK: VARIETY (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “You’ve learned that the body needs variety—a
variety of nutrients that come from a variety of foods.”


2. Say the word _variety_ with me.


3. _Variety_ means different types of the same general class of things.


4. The park has a variety of trees.


5. Think of things that come in a variety of different kinds. For example, grocery
stores contain a variety of fruits, such as bananas, strawberries, oranges,
and apples. Tell us what your favorite variety is and why. Use the word _variety_
when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or
rephrase students’ responses: “My favorite variety of fruit is . . . ”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I am going to group some
items together that are all varieties of the same thing. You must name the
group they have in common. For example, if I said, “peas, broccoli, and
carrots,” you would say, “That’s a variety of vegetables.” Remember to answer
in complete sentences.


  - almonds, pecans, walnuts _(That’s a variety of nuts.)_


  - apples, oranges, grapes _(That’s a variety of fruits.)_

vocabulary.


~~**MULTIPLE-MEANING WORD ACTIVITY (5 MIN.)**~~


**Definition Detective: Skip**

 - Remind students that they heard in the Read-Aloud, “You may stumble over
math problems, thinking five plus seven equals twenty, or skip over a line in
your reader so that your sentences are all mumbo-jumbo.”


 - Have students work with a partner to think of as many meanings for the word
_skip_ as they can, or discuss ways they can use the word _skip_ .


**Show Poster 4M (Skip)**

 - Have students point to the image on the poster that shows how the word _skip_
was used in the lesson. _(one)_

**Speaking and Listening:** Students will identify human body systems and how to
keep the systems healthy. ~~**TEKS 2.1.D**~~


~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED?**~~


  - Have students identify the connection between cells, tissues, organs, and
systems. _(Cells are the smallest units of living things; cells with similar_
_functions together form tissues; tissues form organs; and organs make up the_
_different systems in the body.)_


Check for Understanding


**Recall:** Point to the following systems on Poster 2 and explain the
function of the system:


       - Which is the skeletal system? _(fifth from the left; made up of the_
_bones and gives the body shape)_


       - Which is the respiratory system? _(third from the left; takes in air_
_to the body)_


      - Which is the muscular system? _(last one on the right; allows the_
_body to move and gives it strength)_


      - Which shows both the digestive and excretory systems? _(fourth_
_from the left; turns food into useful nutrients and excretes waste)_


      - Which is the nervous system? _(second from the left; controls_
_communication between the brain and the rest of the body)_


       - Which is the circulatory system? ( _first on the left; keeps blood_
_flowing through the body)_


         - **Turn and Talk:** Talk with your partner about ways you can keep
these systems healthy. [Have several students share their
responses with the class. _(Answers may vary, but may include_
_that they could eat healthy food, have a well-balanced diet, drink_
_plenty of water, etc.)_ ]

~~**“A HEALTHY HUMAN BODY” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 9A-1: Nick Nutri pointing at a**
**diagram of a human body**

Take a look at this, boys and girls. What are

you looking at? Yes, you’re looking inside a

human body with all of its many complicated

parts. Can you find the stomach and the





intestines? Who sees the kidneys and the

bladder? ~~_[Have students identify the various_~~

~~_organs in the image.]_~~

Review the fact that the
stomach, intestines,
kidneys, and bladder are
part of the digestive and
excretory systems.


**124**



Today, we are going to review some of the things that you’ve learned

about the human body and its **network** of important systems. ~~_A network_~~

~~_is a group of things connected to each other._~~ Let’s start with the system

you learned about last. Which system helps you sweat and pee? Yes, the

excretory system. And, who remembers other **terms**, or words, for sweat

and pee? Yes, _perspiration_ and _urine_ .


**TEKS 2.6.B** Generate questions about text before, during, and after reading to deepen understanding and gain information;
**TEKS 2.9.D.i** Recognize characteristics and structures of informational text, including the central idea and supporting

unfamiliar words.


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition


**Show Image 9A-2: Lung and windpipe**

Which system is responsible for processing

your food into nutrients that your body can

use and getting rid of waste that it doesn’t

need?


Yes, the digestive system. Raise your hand

if you can tell me the name of the tube that

carries food from the mouth to the stomach.



Great job—the esophagus is your food tube. We didn’t talk about it, but there

is another tube right in front of it called the **windpipe** . The windpipe leads to

your lungs. Can anyone guess what travels through your windpipe from your

mouth to your lungs? It’s something else that the body needs to live. Right—

air! ~~_[Explain that the esophagus is not shown in this image. Explain that air_~~

~~_travels down the windpipe through the nose or through the mouth.]_~~


**Show Image 9A-3: Muscular, skeletal, and**
**circulatory systems**

Look at the picture of the human body in this

image. Look at all the bones that make up the

skeleton. What’s that system called? Oh, that

was an easy one, wasn’t it? The skeleton is

part of the skeletal system.


Here’s another easy one. What system do

muscles belong to? Yes, the muscular system. The skeletal and muscular

systems work together to help you move.


Nerves are part of your nervous system. Look at Poster 2 (Human Body

Systems). Which one is the nervous system? Do you see the nerves running

like highways across every part of the body, traveling up the spinal column,

all the way to the brain?


Find the circulatory system on Poster 2. Don’t confuse the nerves with veins

and arteries, the tubes that carry blood through the body. The nervous

system and the circulatory system look similar in the pictures. That’s

because blood covers a lot of territory, too. We’ve talked about nutrients

and the way they travel through your blood to support your body systems.

Without blood, these important substances would have no way to nourish

your body. The circulatory system circulates, or moves, your blood.

**Show Image 9A-4: Cells, tissue, and organ**

You know that each body system performs

a separate function, and that each system is

made up of organs.


~~_[Point to the skin, then the tissue, and finally_~~

~~_the cells as you read the following.]_~~


Organs are made up of tissues, and tissues are



made up of cells. From largest to smallest, the order is organs, tissues, then

cells, which are the smallest.


Let’s think about skin as an example. Moving from the smallest part to the largest,

skin cells combine to form skin tissues, and those tissues combine to form the skin

as we see it. That’s the way the human body works. ~~_[Encourage students to touch_~~

~~_the skin of their arms and face.] The skin is an interesting organ because it covers_~~

~~_the entire body, and it is the largest organ in the human body!_~~


It is important to keep your cells, tissues, organs, and body systems all

running smoothly. You can do that in many different ways.


**Show Image 9A-5: Baked potatoes and French**
**fries**

We’ve talked about the importance of making

healthy food choices. Food gives you the nutrients

to help you grow and heal from injury or illness

and energy to breathe and move. Some foods have





more nutrients in them than others. Choose a

variety of foods, especially those high in nutrients.



Balance your daily diet with several servings of grains, fruits, and vegetables,

and smaller portions of dairy, meat, and eggs.


**Show Image 9A-6: Produce**

Remember to eat only a few sweets and fats.

And don’t forget that fresh food will give you

lots more vitamins and minerals than packaged

ones. So, head for the produce aisle or a local

farmers’ market and stock up on fresh fruits





and vegetables. ~~_Look at all the healthy fruits_~~

~~_and vegetables in Nick Nutri’s basket. Which is_~~

~~_your favorite?_~~


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition


Besides eating a well-balanced diet, what other ways can you keep your body

healthy? ~~_[Pause for suggestions.]_~~ Great suggestions!


**Show Image 9A-7: Exercise**

Exercise, or staying active, can help you

maintain a healthy body. When you exercise,

your body uses energy from the food you eat.

The amount of energy that food provides to

the human body is measured by **calories** .

Food labels list the number of calories, or the

amount of energy, in packaged foods, telling

you how much energy is stored in them. You should eat enough food each

day to provide your body with about the same amount of energy that it uses

up during the day. If you eat too much and don’t exercise, your body will

store the extra food energy as fat. If you don’t eat enough to satisfy your

body’s needs, your body will use its stored energy and you may lose fat.


You are burning energy all the time, even when you are sleeping, but your

body uses much more energy to exercise than it does to sleep. If you weighed

a hundred pounds, you would burn about forty calories just by standing still

for thirty minutes, but if you walked for thirty minutes, you would burn about

120 calories. You would use up three times more energy by walking as you

would by standing still for the same amount of time.


Here’s a puzzle for you to solve. There are about 160 calories in a snack-size

bag of potato chips. If you burn 120 calories by walking for thirty minutes,

about how much longer would you need to walk to burn up all the calories in

that bag of chips?


~~(You would have to walk another ten minutes—forty minutes in all—to burn~~

~~the additional forty calories in the bag of chips. 120/30=4 calories per~~

~~minute)~~ What type of exercise do you think might burn the calories even

faster than walking?



Support


Record the numbers on
the board/chart paper
and have students try
to find the solution.



Lesson 9 A Healthy Human Body
**127**


**Show Image 9A-8: More exercise**

Exercise keeps your heart and lungs working

well, fights off illness and disease, and builds

strong bones and muscles. Make exercise a

daily part of your life. Whenever possible, walk

and cycle instead of getting in a car. Climb

stairs instead of taking an elevator. Swim, play

soccer, take karate or gymnastics lessons,

or shoot hoops with your buddies. All of these are good forms of exercise.

Choose what you enjoy and have fun! ~~_What kinds of exercise do you enjoy?_~~


**Show Image 9A-9: Good hygiene**

Keeping clean is another important part

of staying healthy. There are many types

of germs that can make you sick. Bacteria,

the tiny, one-celled creatures that Anton

van Leeuwenhoek studied, are one of the





most common types of germs. Bacteria are

everywhere. They are an important part of



nature, and most bacteria are not your enemies. In fact, many bacteria live in

your gut and help you digest your food.


Millions more good bacteria live on your skin. But, you can also accidentally

pick up harmful bacteria as you go about your day. That’s why it is important

to wash your hands with soap often and well. Wash them throughout the

day, especially before eating and after using the bathroom. Besides hand

washing, make sure that you clean every other part of your body, too. Take

frequent showers and baths, shampoo often, and keep your fingernails short

and clean. Brush your teeth regularly to get rid of old food and germs that

feed on it. Use floss to keep your gums healthy and get rid of food stuck

between your teeth.


**Show Image 9A-10: Regular habits**

Regular toilet habits are signs of good health.

Most of the time you don’t have to think too

hard about these daily habits, but sometimes

your body reacts and lets you know that you

need to take extra care. When waste systems





do not function well, drinking lots of water

usually helps. Make sure to listen to your body


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition



**128**


and the nerve signals that it sends to your brain. Don’t put off using the

bathroom when you need to go.


**Show Image 9A-11: Sleep**

How many of you wake up feeling tired in the

morning? Has anyone ever asked you, “Did you

get up on the wrong side of the bed?”


If you’re tired or grouchy when you wake up,





that may mean that you are not getting all of

the rest that your body needs. Most seven
or eight-year-olds need about ten or eleven



hours of sleep each night. As you sleep, damaged body cells and tissues are

repaired and replaced. If you are sick, sleep will help speed your **recovery**, or

return to good health.


Eating well, exercising, keeping clean, and getting enough rest are all good

ways to keep your millions and billions and trillions of tiny cells working

properly. You should also make sure to have regular checkups with a doctor

or other health care professional.


I have loved sharing my knowledge of health and nutrition with you. Your

body is yours alone, and you alone have the power to take care of it your

whole life. Now that you know what to do to keep it in good condition, I hope

you will treat it as well as you would any one of your favorite machines.


**Show Image 9A-12: The amazing human body**

I’m sure you’ll agree that you’ll never find

another machine quite as amazing as the

human body!

5. **Evaluative.** _What? Pair-Share:_ Asking questions after a Read-Aloud is one
way to see how much everyone has learned. Think of a question you can
ask your neighbor about the Read-Aloud that starts with the word _what_ . For
example, you could ask, “What is one way to prevent germs from entering
the body?” Turn to your neighbor and ask your _what_ question. Listen to your
neighbor’s response. Then your neighbor will ask a new _what_ question, and
you will get a chance to respond. I will call on several of you to share your
questions with the class.


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition


~~**WORD WORK: RECOVERY (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “If you are sick, sleep will help speed
your recovery.”


2. Say the word _recovery_ with me.


3. _Recovery_ means a return to good health from an illness or injury.


4. Will made a complete recovery after breaking his leg.


5. Think of a time you made a recovery, and use the word _recovery_ when you tell
us about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase
students’ responses: “With rest and time, I made a recovery from . . . ”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I am going to read some
statements. If the statement describes a recovery, say, “That is a recovery.”
If it does not describe a recovery, say, “That is not a recovery.” Remember to
answer in complete sentences.


  - Keisha missed several days of school, but she still had a fever when she woke
up this morning so she missed another day. _(That is not a recovery.)_


  - Felicity caught the chicken pox, was home for a week, and when she went
back to school she was completely healed. _(That is a recovery.)_


  - Even after seeing the physical therapist twice a week for a month, Pierre’s
elbow still ached. _(That is not a recovery.)_


  - After a long night at the hospital, Dr. Simon took a nap and felt as good as
new. _(That is a recovery.)_

procedural texts and reports.


Unit 8 The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition


   - What would you do to keep your body healthy during the day?


   - How would you end the day?


 - Have students add an illustration at the top of Activity Page 9.2 to support
their writing.


 - Have several students share their journal entry with the class.


 - Collect all the journal pages to assemble into individual student journals, but
consider making copies of the pages for inclusion in the students’ writing
portfolios.


 - Explore with students various digital tools to publish their journals. Such
tools include various student-publishing software and web-based publishing
programs.


**SAYINGS AND PHRASES: “GET UP ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE**
~~**BED” (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain that sayings are literary devices that usually express general truths
based on experiences and observations of everyday life. While some sayings
do have literal meanings—that is, they mean exactly what they say—many
have a richer meaning beyond the literal level.


 - Ask students if they have ever heard anyone say “She got up on the wrong
side of the bed” or “Did he get up on the wrong side of the bed?”



Support


Encourage students
to use Activity Page
9.1 to remind them of
some healthy habits.
Encourage them to
include sentences in
their paragraph that
they wrote on Activity
Page 9.1.


Support


Be sure students
understand the
difference between the
literal meanings of the
words and their implied
or figurative meanings.


Challenge




- Have students repeat the saying “get up on the wrong side of the bed.”



Remind students that
in today’s Read-Aloud,
one possible reason was
given for why someone
might get up on the
wrong side of the bed.
Have them explain that
reason. _(Someone might_
_be said to have gotten_
_up on the wrong side of_
_the bed because he or_
_she did not get enough_
_sleep and woke up_
_grumpy.)_




- Explain that this saying is another way of saying that someone woke up in
a bad mood and is acting grouchy or mean.




- Ask students if they have ever woken up in a bad mood and stayed
grouchy for a while. Explain that instead of saying “I’m in a really bad
mood,” they could say “I got up on the wrong side of the bed.”




- Give students the opportunity to recount an experience with in which they
“got up on the wrong side of the bed.” Remind them to use appropriate facts
and relevant, descriptive details, and to speak audibly in coherent sentences.




- Look for more opportunities to use this saying in the classroom.

#### Unit Assessment


This unit assessment evaluates each student’s retention of unit and
academic vocabulary words and the core content targeted in _The Human_
_Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition_ . The results should guide review and
remediation the following day.


There are four parts to this assessment. You may choose to do the parts
in more than one sitting if you feel this is more appropriate for your
students. Part I (vocabulary assessment) is divided into two sections: the
first assesses unit-related vocabulary, and the second assesses academic
vocabulary. Parts II, III, and IV of the assessment address the core content
targeted in _The Human Body: Building Blocks and Nutrition_ .

Read-Alouds. If the answer to the question is yes, circle thumbs-up. If the
answer is no, circle thumbs-down. I will ask each question two times. Let’s do
number one together.


**Note:** For students who will be using the Editable PDF Activity Page, please
have them answer by typing “yes” if the sentence is correct, and “no” if the
sentence is incorrect.

~~**PART II**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.6.G**~~


**Directions:** For each row of pictures, you will be asked to look for specific
things. Follow my directions carefully. In some instances there may be more
than one right answer and you may circle more than one picture. We will do
the first one together.


**Note:** If students will be using the Editable PDF Activity Page, please have
them type the answer(s) inside the boxes.


1. Look at the pictures in the first row. How are these pictures alike? _(They are_
_all pictures of tools with lenses that magnify objects.)_ The first picture is a
picture of a telescope. The next picture is a picture of a modern microscope.
The third picture shows a hand lens or magnifying glass, and the fourth
picture shows an early microscope. Anton van Leeuwenhoek made many
microscopes to study living cells. Circle the picture that looks most like the
microscopes he made over 400 years ago. Which picture should you circle?


**TEKS 2.6.G** Evaluate details read to determine key ideas.

**Grade 2 | Unit 8**
#### Culminating Activities


~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


Please use this final day to address class results of the Unit Assessment. Based on
the results of the Unit Assessment, you may wish to use this class time to provide
remediation opportunities that target specific areas of weakness for individual
students, small groups, or the whole class.


Alternatively, you may also choose to use this class time to extend or enrich
students’ experience with unit knowledge. A number of enrichment activities are
provided in this section in order to provide students with opportunities to enliven
their experiences with unit concepts.


~~**REMEDIATION**~~


  - You may choose to regroup students according to particular areas of
weakness, as indicated by Formative and Unit Assessment results.


  - Remediation opportunities include:


    - targeting Review Activities


    - revisiting lesson Applications


    - rereading and discussing select Read-Alouds


~~**ENRICHMENT**~~


**Guest Presenter**

  - Invite a nutritionist to come talk to the class about healthy foods and healthy
eating habits.


Culminating Activities
**141**


**142**



**Making a Simple Magnifying Glass**


Materials: Clear plastic bottle; dry marker pen; scissors; water

 - **Directions** :


   - Draw a circle shape at the neck of the bottle. It is important that it is at the
neck so that it creates a disc shape.


   - Cut out the circle.


   - Pour a drop of water into the disc.


   - Hold it over a book and watch the letters get bigger.


   - The science simply explained:


   - The disc shape curves outward, forming a convex shape. By adding
the water, the light that passes through it is refracted, or bent inwards,
creating a lens effect and enlarging the size of the letters.


**Reading Food Labels**

 - Collect or have students bring packaged food labels to class.


 - Divide students into groups, and give each group a handful of labels.


 - Ask them to plan a well-balanced meal from the foods they are given.


 - Have them record various findings: sodium content, added sugars, vitamins,
calories, etc., and hold a discussion to see if they are indeed able to put
together a well-balanced meal from packaged food.


**Round-Robin Storytelling of Food’s Journey**

 - Display a chart or image of the digestive system.


 - Have students sit in a circle, and tell them that they are going to make up the
tale of a piece of food on its journey through the digestive tract.


 - Ask for a volunteer to begin the tale, for example, “I opened my mouth and
put a cube of cheese into its opening”.


 - Proceed around the circle, having each student add a sentence: “My teeth
crushed the cheese . . . Saliva swirled around my mouth and softened the
cheese . . . As I chewed, the cheese formed a lump of food,” and so on.


 - You may want to hand out random cue cards with words written on them
(saliva, esophagus, etc.) rather than going in order around the circle. This will
facilitate the telling of the story—making sure every step in the process is
included—and keep students more involved, awaiting their turns.
