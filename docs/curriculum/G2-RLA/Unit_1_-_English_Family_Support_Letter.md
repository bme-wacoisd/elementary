# **Welcome!**
#### **Grade 2, Unit 1**
## **Fairy Tales and Tall Tales**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will explore classic fairy tales and tall tales and the well-known
lessons they teach.

### **What’s the story?**

Students will listen to classic stories such as “ **Beauty** **and the Beast** ” and “ **Paul Bunyan**,”
which will lay the foundation for understanding stories in future grades.

### **What will my student learn?**

Students will review the **elements of fiction** they learned about in previous grades. They
will take the **lessons** that are learned from the stories and use them to **relate to the**
**problems** the **characters** **face** . Students will also be introduced to the **American**
**frontier** as they listen to various tall tales and explore the elements of that genre.


Students will use their knowledge of the elements and characteristics of fairy tales and tall
tales to **write about a scene** from a story and **rewrite** **a fairy tale** of their own.


Note: The stories and ballads of John Henry and Casey Jones both briefly reference the
topic of death.

### **Conversation starters**

Ask your student questions about the unit to promote discussion and continued learning:


1. What are some of the characteristics you have learned about fairy tales?

**Follow up:** How did you know that “The Emperor’s New Clothes” or “Beauty and the
Beast” was a fairy tale? What lesson did you learn from a fairy tale you read?

2. In the story “Beauty and the Beast,” the b east is described as fearsome. What does
_fearsome_ mean?
**Follow up:** What made him seem fearsome? Can you think of other words that are
synonyms (that is, have the same meaning) of _fearsome_ ?

3. Is “Paul Bunyan” a fairy tale or a tall tale?

**Follow up:** How did you know? What is one of the exaggerations you talked about
when you read the story?

4. What were your two favorite tall tales you read? (“Paul Bunyan,” “Pecos Bill,” “John
Henry,” “Casey Jones”)
**Follow up:** What was the same about the two main characters? What was different?
What made each of them seem larger than life? What parts of each of the tall tales
could really happen? What parts could not really happen?
