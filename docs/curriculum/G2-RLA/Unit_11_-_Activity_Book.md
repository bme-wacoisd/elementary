###### **Unit 11** **Flight and the Story of Aviation**

**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the
Teacher Guide for Unit 11. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the
lesson number and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there
are two activity pages for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. The
activity pages in this book do not always include written instructions for students because
the instructions would have words that are not decodable. Teachers will explain these activity
pages to the students orally, using the instructions in the Teacher Guide. The Activity Book is a
student component, which means each student should have an Activity Book.
