Dear Family Member,


## 1.2 Take-Home



Today, your student heard the fairy tale “The Fisherman and His Wife,” a story about
a man who catches a magic fish that grants the fisherman’s wife several wishes. In the
coming days your student will hear two more fairy tales: “The Emperor’s New Clothes”
and “Beauty and the Beast.” Below are some suggestions for activities that you may do at
home to reinforce what your student is learning about fairy tales.


1. “The Fisherman and His Wife”


Have your student share what s/he remembers about the fairy tale “The Fisherman
and His Wife.” (A fisherman catches a fish in the sea; the fish tells the man he is actually
an enchanted prince who has been turned into a fish; the fisherman throws the fish back;
the fisherman’s wife asks why he didn’t first ask the fish for a wish and sends him back
to ask for several wishes; finally, the wife asks for too many things and the fish leaves
them with what they had at the beginning of the story.) As your student shares what s/he
remembers, fill in any gaps in the plot, and ask your student if s/he thinks there is a lesson
to be learned from this fairy tale.


2. Draw and Write


Have your student draw and write a scene from any of the fairy tales s/he has heard
(“The Fisherman and His Wife,” “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” and “Beauty and the
Beast”). Then have him/her share his/her drawing and writing with you. Ask questions to
keep your student using the vocabulary learned at school (see back of page).


3. “The Emperor’s New Clothes”


Ask your student to retell the fairy tale “The Emperor’s New Clothes.” (An emperor
finds great pleasure in dressing in different outfits; a strange weaver and tailor arrive and
tell him they can make magical clothes, clothes only clever people can see; the emperor
believes their story and hires them; everyone lies and says they can see the clothes in
order to appear clever; a child finally states the truth.) Ask your student what they liked
most about this fairy tale and if they think there is a lesson to be learned from this story.


4. Sayings and Phrases: “Better Late Than Never”


Your student will learn the saying “better late than never” in relation to the fairy tale
“Beauty and the Beast.” Ask your student how this saying relates to the fairy tale. (Beauty

left the palace of the beast and returned home to her father and sisters in order to say
good-bye to them and the life she had known. The beast told her to come back in one
month, but Beauty could not bring herself to say good-bye to her father. It wasn’t until
Beauty had a terrible dream about the beast that she returned to his palace. When Beauty
found the beast, she was almost too late, but she arrived there just in time to revive him
with her tears.) Talk with your student about other situations where one might use the
saying “better late than never.”


5. Words to Use


Below is a list of some of the words that your student will be using and learning about.
Try to use these words as they come up in everyday speech with your student.

     - _enchanted_ —The fisherman caught an enchanted fish that was able to grant him
wishes.

     - _admired_ —The emperor admired himself in the mirror as he tried on his new
clothes.

     - _fearsome_ —Beauty was terrified when she first laid eyes on the fearsome beast.

     - _curious_ —The beast told Beauty of all the curious events in the palace and how
he was changed from a prince to a beast.


6. Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read with your student every day. There should be time to
read to your student and also time to listen to your student read to you.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what s/he has
learned at school.

Dear Family Member,


## 5.2 Take-Home



Today, your student heard the tall tale “Paul Bunyan,” a story about a fictional logger on
the American frontier. Over the next few days, your student will hear three more tall tales
about other larger-than-life characters on the American frontier—Pecos Bill, John Henry,
and Casey Jones. Each tall tale will expose your student to the use of exaggeration. Please
note that the stories of John Henry and Casey Jones briefly reference death. Below are
some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to reinforce what your student is
learning about tall tales.


1. Telling a Tall Tale


Ask your student what elements make a tall tale. (larger-than-life characters;
exaggerations; amazing childhoods; unbelievable adventures; inventions of things in
nature; humor) Ask your student to retell a tall tale. Then create your own tall tale with your
student, asking him/her what kinds of characters and settings you will need. Ask him/her
to provide ideas for your larger-than-life character’s adventures.


2. Exaggerations


Have your student share some of the exaggerations s/he has heard from the tall
tales. (Paul Bunyan made the Mississippi River and dug the Grand Canyon; Casey Jones
drove a train and was known for always being on time; Pecos Bill rode a mountain lion and
squeezed the meanness out of a rattlesnake; John Henry was born with a hammer in his
hand and could swing a ten-pound hammer all day without getting tired.) Share with your
student any literary exaggerations you know of.


3. Draw and Write


Have your student draw and write about what s/he has learned about any of the tall
tale characters—Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill, John Henry, or Casey Jones—and then have
him/her share his/her drawing and writing with you. Ask questions to keep your student
using the vocabulary learned at school.


4. Song: “The Ballad of John Henry”


Find a recording of “The Ballad of John Henry” from the public library or on the
Internet, and listen to it with your student. As you listen, have your student explain the tall
tale of John Henry in his or her own words.
