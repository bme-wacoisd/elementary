**Flip Book Introduction**


This Flip Book contains images that accompany the Teacher
Guide for _Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government_ . The
images are in sequential order. Each image is identified by its
lesson number, read-aloud letter (A or B), and the number of
the image within the particular read-aloud. For example, the
first image in Read-Aloud 1A is numbered 1A-1. Once you have
worked your way through the book to the last page, you will flip
the entire book over to view the second half of the images.


Depending on your classroom configuration, you may need
to have students sit closer to the Flip Book in order to see the
images clearly.
