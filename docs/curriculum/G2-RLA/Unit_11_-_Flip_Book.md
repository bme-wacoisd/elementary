**Flip Book Introduction**


This Flip Book contains images that accompany the Teacher
Guide for _Flight and the Story of Aviation_ . The images are in
sequential order. Each image is identified by its lesson number,

read-aloud letter (A or B), and the number of the image within
the particular read-aloud. For example, the first image in ReadAloud 7A is numbered 7A-1. Once you have worked your way
throughout the book to the last page, you will flip the entire
book over to view the second half of the images.


Depending on your classroom configuration, you may
need to have students sit closer to the flip book in order

to see the images clearly.
