#### **Unit 5** **Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops**

**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the
Teacher Guide for Unit 5. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the
lesson number and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there
are two activity pages for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. The
activity pages in this book do not always include written instructions for students because
the instructions would have words that are not decodable. Teachers will explain these activity
pages to the students orally, using the instructions in the Teacher Guide. The Activity Book is a
student component, which means each student should have an Activity Book.

Dear Family Member,


### 1.2 Take-Home



During the next several days, your student will learn about cycles and explore some
of the different types of cycles that occur in nature. Your student will be introduced to the
reasons why we have daytime and nighttime and the four seasons on planet Earth, and
to the different seasonal changes that affect the life cycles of plants and trees. Below are
some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to reinforce what your student is
learning about cycles of nature.


1. Personal Connections


Share with your student your favorite season and the different experiences from your
own childhood connected with seasonal changes. Emphasize the changes observed in
plants and animals. Ask your student what favorite memories they have of a particular
season shared with you and your family.


2. Draw and Write


Have your student draw and/or write what they have learned about seasonal cycles
and the life cycles of plants. Ask questions to help your student use the vocabulary learned
at school.


3. Words to Use


Below is a list of some of the words that your student will be learning about and using.
Try to use these words as they come up in everyday speech with your student.

     - _revolve_ —It takes one year for Earth to revolve around the sun.

     - _hibernation_ —Some animals have longer periods of winter hibernation than
others.

     - _cycles_ —Planet Earth has many cycles, such as day and night, the seasons, and
life cycles of plants and animals.


4. Read Aloud Each Day


Set aside time to read aloud to your student every day. The local library has many
books on cycles of nature.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they have
been learning at school.
