###### Introduction


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching the
_Insects: All Around_ unit. The Teacher Guide for _Insects: All Around_ contains eight daily lessons, each of
which is composed of two distinct parts, so the lesson may be divided into smaller chunks of time and
presented at different intervals during the day. The entire lesson will require a total of sixty minutes.


This unit includes a one-day Pausing Point following Lesson 5. At the end of the unit, a Unit Review, a
Unit Assessment, and Culminating Activities are included to allow time to review, reinforce, assess,
and remediate content knowledge. You should spend no more than twelve days total on this unit.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


At the back of this Teacher Guide you will find a section titled “Teacher Resources.” In this section
you will find the following:


  - Activity Book Answer Key


  - Measures of Text Complexity


  - Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Correlation Chart


  - English Language Proficiency Standards Correlation Chart


~~**UNIT COMPONENTS**~~


Along with this Teacher Guide, you will need:


  - Flip Book for _Insects: All Around_


  - Activity Book for _Insects: All Around_


  - Image Cards for _Insects: All Around_


All unit components’ materials can also be found in the program’s online materials.


Introduction
**1**


~~**WHY INSECTS ARE IMPORTANT**~~


This unit will introduce students to the largest group of animals on Earth. Students will learn the
characteristics of insects, the life cycles of insects, how insects can be categorized as solitary or
social, and how insects are viewed as both helpful and harmful. For example, students will learn how
insects are important to the process of pollination and in the production of honey, some cosmetics,
and even medicines. This unit will lay the foundation for review and further study of the life cycles,
habitats, and classifications of insects and other animals.


**Note:** Each of the Read-Alouds in this unit is narrated by a different character. Lessons 1 through 7
are narrated by an insect character, and Lesson 8 is narrated by an entomologist.


The text that students will be reading and discussing provides opportunities for students to build
content knowledge and draw connections to science. You may build on class discussions to support
students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of Organisms and Environments and
Scientific Investigation and Reasoning from the Science TEKS. This content is not a replacement
for grade-level science and social studies instruction. For more information about the quantitative
and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text
Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED**~~



The following units, and the specific core content that was targeted in those units, are particularly
relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _Insects: All Around_ . This background knowledge wil
greatly enhance students’ understanding of the Read-Alouds they are about to enjoy.


**Plants: How Do They Grow? (Kindergarten)**


**Animals and Habitats: The World We Share (Grade 1)**


**Cycles of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops (Grade 2)**


~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR INSECTS: ALL AROUND**~~



l



**2**



The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _Insects: All Around_ in the forms in
which they appear in the Read-Alouds or, in some instances, in the “Introducing the Read-Aloud”
section at the beginning of the lesson. Boldfaced words in the list have an associated Word Work
activity. The inclusion of the words on this list does not mean that students are immediately
expected to be able to use all of these words on their own. However, through repeated exposure
throughout the lessons, they should acquire a good understanding of most of these words and begin
to use some of them in conversation.

~~**CORE CONTENT OBJECTIVES**~~


Students will:








  - Explain that insects are the largest group of animals on Earth


  - Explain that there are many different types of insects


  - Explain the behaviors of solitary and social insects


  - Classify insects based on their defining characteristics


  - Identify and describe the three main body parts of insects: head, thorax, and abdomen


  - Describe an insect’s exoskeleton


  - Explain why spiders are not insects


  - Describe insect life cycles and the stages of complete and incomplete metamorphosis


  - Describe various social insect colonies including the jobs performed in the colony


  - Describe the many ways insects communicate with one another


  - Identify ways in which insects can be helpful to humans


  - Identify ways in which insects can be harmful to humans


  - Identify ways in which humans can be harmful to insects


Introduction

~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit students will practice collecting and synthesizing information by recording information
in journals. Students will be given specific timelines to complete journaling assignments, but the
journal itself should be viewed as a collection of ideas instead of a completed product. Students
should be be able to return to their previous entries, and teachers should monitor students progress
in writing over time. To ensure the success of all learners, teachers should allow for flexibility in
writing prompts and incorporation of editing and revision skills.


Students will also work independently to write an informational narrative in the style of the ReadAlouds in this unit. They will build upon their learning from Units 3 and 4 by including a character,
and a plot with a beginning, middle, and end. During this project they will use the writing process
to plan, draft, and edit their informational narrative. During the editing step, students will focus
on editing drafts for prepositions and prepositional phrases, correct use of pronouns, and using
commas in a series and in dates.


**Writing Portfolio**


The following activities may be added to students’ writing portfolios:


 - Insects Journal (Lessons 1–4)


 - Plan an Informational Narrative (Activity Page 5.1)


 - Draft an Informational Narrative (Activity Page 6.1)


 - Edit an Informational Narrative (Activity Page 8.1)

Unit 6 Insects: All Around


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Application**


Prepare a booklet with at least ten pages for each student in the class to
serve as an insect journal throughout this unit. Make sure the pages are large
enough that students can easily draw and write on them. You may wish to
ask the art teacher to help students construct their own blank booklets in art
class and decorate the covers.


**Note to Teacher**


The Read-Alouds in this unit ask students rhetorical questions. If you
think students may know the answer, you may wish to pause and have
them answer. It is not expected that students know the answers to these
questions. If students do not know the answer, or you do not wish to pause,
simply continue reading, as the text will provide the answer.


Many scientific terms, such as _host, solitary,_ and _social,_ have broader
meanings in everyday speech, and more specific denotations in science.
When possible, help students understand both the broad meaning of the
word (e.g., _solitary_ means alone) and the more narrow scientific meaning
within the context of the unit (e.g., solitary insects are insects that survive
by living alone or in pairs). By understanding both meanings, students begin
to understand how to use words appropriately in both unit-specific and
general conversation and begin to understand that words can have many
connotations and uses.


**Universal Access**

  - Find images depicting different habitats, including the habitat in which you
live, to show students during the Introducing the Read-Aloud activity.


  - Find images depicting insects local to your area to share with students.

**Show Image 1A-2: Common housefly**

Hello, boys and girls. I’ve been invited to join

you today to talk about a very important

subject—me. Who knows what type of animal

I am? Right. I’m a fly. I’ll bet most of you have

seen lots and lots of flies, haven’t you? I’m





told that you find us flies rather annoying, so

I’m guessing that you’ve swatted at one of my



billions of cousins at least once in your life!

Unit 6 Insects: All Around


~~_small pieces of tape.]_~~ I am a housefly, the most common type, but there are

many other fly species on Earth. A species is a group of plants or animals

that are alike in important ways. Horseflies, robber flies, fruit flies, gnats, and

mosquitoes have many different species that all belong to the same group.


**Show Image 1A-4: Planet Earth**

Scientists group animals into different

categories. What different kinds of animals

can you name? Yes—fish, reptiles, amphibians,

birds, and **insects** are just a few of the animal

groups you know. Flies, like me, belong to





the largest group of animals on Earth. Who

knows which group is the largest? Insects! ~~_For_~~



~~_every ten animal species in the world, about eight of them are insects! And_~~

~~_scientists continue to discover more._~~ Insects are small animals with six legs

and three main body parts. We flies are insects, and we share the planet with

millions of other insects in many different **habitats** .


Habitats are the natural homes of plants and animals. Can you name a few?

Great—deserts, forests, mountains, grasslands, and tundra are some you

may know about. During the next few lessons, some of my fellow insect

friends are going to teach you lots of interesting facts about insects that live

in different kinds of habitats.


We insects live all over the earth—everywhere except the ocean. Insects can

even live in some very cold or very hot areas of the earth!


**Show Image 1A-5: Alfalfa field in bloom**

We’ll start today by looking at meadow

grasslands. Look at this field of alfalfa. Do you

see any animals in the picture? It just looks

like an ordinary field without much going on,

doesn’t it? But, don’t be fooled; this field is





teeming with life ~~_or full of life_~~ ! If you sat down

in the middle of this meadow and closed



your eyes, you would likely hear birds singing, but you might be completely

unaware of the often silent, hidden world of insects all around you.

and would die without their host plants.


**Show Image 1A-7: Grasshopper, leafhopper,**

Many meadow plants attract grasshoppers.

~~_[Point to the insect in the top left corner.]_~~

Grasshoppers feed on the leaves and stems

of the alfalfa plant. Harder to spot is the tiny





**Show Image 1A-6: Insect eggs on leaf**

Many insects depend on plants to live. Many

insects eat plants and some lay their eggs on

plants. The plant on which an insect lays its

eggs, and which provides food for its young,

acts as a host and is called a host plant. ~~_A_~~

~~_host is a plant or animal on which, or in which,_~~

~~_another thing lives._~~ Each host plant attracts





leafhopper, ~~_[Point to the insect in the bottom_~~

~~_left corner.]_~~ but this wedge-shaped insect



can slow down the host plant’s growth, turning the plant brown as it sucks

nutrition from it.


Many insects, such as these tiny aphids, [/ae*f ə dz/] ~~_[Point to the insects_~~

~~_on the right side.]_~~ can damage entire meadows. Grasshoppers, leafhoppers,

and aphids are all pests. Farmers are never happy when they discover them

on their plants because they can destroy their crops. But not all insects

are pests.

insects on their plants.


Unit 6 Insects: All Around


From grasslands, let’s move to a forest habitat. Both cone-bearing

evergreens and deciduous trees live in this forest. ~~_[Prompt students to_~~

~~_remember that evergreens have green needles all year round and deciduous_~~

~~_trees drop their leaves each year.]_~~


**Show Image 1A-9: Pine trees and bark beetle**

Many trees, like these pine trees, are hosts to

a variety of bark beetles. These tiny insects

can kill huge trees! How can that be possible?

Bark beetles burrow, or dig, under a tree’s

bark, creating a series of tunnels in which they





lay their eggs. Well, let’s think about this . . .

what does a tree need to live? ~~_A tree needs_~~



~~_water, nutrients, and sunlight to live._~~ By burrowing into the layer of wood

beneath the bark, these beetles stop the flow of nutrients, or food, and water,

throughout the tree and often kill the tree.


**Show Image 1A-10: Swarm of army ants**

Lots of insects live high up in the treetops of

the forest and many insects also live on the

forest floor. Can you think of any? Ants are

one of the most common insects on Earth,

and many live in the forest. Unlike many





of us **solitary** insects that live on our own,

ants are **social** insects that live in colonies,



or groups. ~~_How are social insects and solitary insects different from one_~~

~~_another?_~~ Let’s look at an especially interesting social ant that lives in

the rainforest.

This is an army ant. Army ants travel in big

cooperative raiding parties to hunt prey. ~~_Prey_~~

Challenge


_Social_ and _solitary_ are
also words that we use to
describe people. What do
_social_ and _solitary_ mean in
terms of people?


Support


_Solitary_ can also mean
alone, without any other
people. When we talk
about animals such as
insects being solitary, it
has a slightly different
meaning; it refers to
animals that do not live in
large groups, but live alone
or with one other animal.
Solitary animals are the
opposite of social animals.

_Social_ can also describe
being with a group of
people. When we talk

animals.





together. These ants are known for swarming

their prey all at once. You’ll learn more about



ants another day, so let’s take a quick peek at one more forest insect.



Lesson 1 Insects Everywhere!
**15**


**Show Image 1A-12: Rhinoceros beetle**

This beetle is named for the long, large horn

at the front of its head. Does its horn look

like that of any other animal that you already

know? I’m thinking of a much larger animal.

Yes, a rhinoceros! The rhinoceros beetle uses

its horn for digging places to hide and for

finding food. Male rhinoceros beetles use their



horns for wrestling with other males in an effort to attract a female beetle.


**Show Image 1A-13: Tundra and crane fly**


~~_What habitat is shown in this image?_~~ What

kinds of insects do you think live in the coldest

habitats? There are many types of flies on the

cold tundra, including houseflies like me.





This Arctic crane fly has amazingly long legs.

And, guess what? Adult crane flies have no



mouths—so they never eat! These mouthless creatures only live for a few

days. ~~_Why do you think they live only for a few days?_~~


**Show Image 1A-14: Dragonfly hovering above**
**water**

Some insects are aquatic, meaning that they

live in or near water. Here’s one that you may

have seen in rivers, ponds, or streams. This

insect is a dragonfly!





**16**



A few minutes ago, however, I told you that

there is one large water habitat that does not

support the life of insects. Do you remember what that habitat is? ~~_[Pause for_~~

~~_students’ responses.]_~~ The ocean!


Unit 6 Insects: All Around


**Show Image 1A-15: Planet Earth**

Let’s look at Earth again. Is Earth covered by

more land or more water? Right—nearly two
thirds of Earth is covered by water and most

of that water is in our oceans. Think about it.

Oceans are the world’s biggest habitat, yet no

insects live there. But insects, found on only

one-third of the earth’s surface, are still the



largest group of animals on Earth!


**Show Image 1A-16: Insect collage**

~~_[Point to each insect as you read its name.]_~~

Flies. Grasshoppers. Ants. Caterpillars.

Beetles. These are all insects, yet they look

quite different from one another—different

shapes, sizes, and colors. So, what makes an





insect an insect? You’ll find out next time. In

the meantime, be thinking about how a fly is

like a grasshopper, or a beetle is like an ant. ~~_Even though they look different,_~~

~~_what are some things these insects might have in common with each other?_~~


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What is the largest group or category of animals on Earth? _(insects)_


2. **Literal.** In what large water habitat are insects unable to survive? _(ocean)_


3. **Inferential.** Many insects depend upon host plants to stay alive. In what ways
do these host plants help the insects? _(provide food and a place to lay eggs)_


4. **Inferential.** If you were a farmer, which would you rather see on your crops:
a ladybug or a grasshopper? Why? _(A ladybug, because grasshoppers eat and_
_kill some plants; a ladybug, because they eat insects that destroy crops.)_


Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** Name an insect and the habitat it lives in. Then,
describe how the insect lives in that habitat. _(Answers may vary._
_One example of a possible answer is: Grasshoppers live in meadows_
_and feed on the leaves and stems of alfalfa.)_

insects live there.


2. Say the word _habitats_ with me. What do you think this word means? What
words or phrases from the Read-Aloud make you think that?


3. Habitats are the specific environments in which plants and animals live and
thrive.


4. Houseflies can live in various habitats, including the cold tundra.


5. Think of some other animals that you have learned about. What are the types
of habitats in which those animals live? Use the word _habitats_ when you talk
about them. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase
the students’ responses: “ live in habitats called . . .”]

**Writing:** In a journal, students will write about a past experience with an insect.


~~**TEKS 2.1.A; TEKS 2.12.B**~~


~~**SAYINGS AND PHRASES (5 MIN.)**~~


**Eaten Out of House and Home**

  - Ask students if they have ever heard anyone say they were “eaten out of
house and home.”


  - Have students repeat the saying.


  - Explain that this saying is another way of saying that someone (or
something) has eaten all of the food in your house. Tell students that instead
of saying, “When my friends came over, they ate all the food in the house,”
you could say, “When my friends came over, we were eaten out of house and
home.”


  - Remind students that they heard about a few insects today that live on,
and eat, different types of plants and trees. For example, grasshoppers,
leafhoppers, and aphids feed off various types of plants and can even eat
enough to destroy entire meadows. These insects, which also live on these
host plants, can be said to have “eaten [themselves] out of house and home.”


  - Look for opportunities to use the saying “eaten out of house and home”
in your classroom, and encourage students to use the saying throughout
the day.


~~**INSECTS JOURNAL: NARRATIVE (15 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.1.A**~~


  - Tell students they are going to create an Insects Journal to record the
information they are learning about insects. Give students the following
multi-step directions:


1. Write your name on the cover as the author and illustrator of the journal.


2. Give your journal a title.

4. Think about a time you have interacted personally with insects and write
a story about it on the second page of your journal. Write at least three
sentences about it in your journal. Think about all of the following things as
you write:

   - How did the insect look?


   - Where did you see the insect?


   - What did you do? What did the insect do?


5. If you have extra time, you may also wish to draw a picture to illustrate your
story.


Check for Understanding


**Circulate and Ask:** Circulate and guide students as they write
their narratives by asking them questions such as “What kind of
insect did you see?”


 - Ask students to share their drawings, sentences, and questions with the
class. As students share, expand upon their vocabulary using richer and
more complex language, including, if possible, any Read-Aloud vocabulary.
Tell students to keep in mind any unanswered questions to see if they are
answered in the following days.


 - Collect students’ Insects Journals to check that they have recorded any
questions about insects and have drawn and written about an insect. Be
prepared to return these to students for the next lesson.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Application**






  - Prepare a classroom library filled with at least twenty books about insects.
You may also have students visit the school library to search for books
about insects. Note that all of these books do not necessarily need to match
students’ reading level. Students are not expected to be able to decode all
of these books as they are only being used as a reference. It may even be
beneficial to include field guides and other adult books that contain highly
detailed and informative illustrations, and to model their use for students.


  - Maintain this library throughout the unit as students will use these books for
reference throughout the Insects Journal activity.


  - **Note to Teacher:** The Insects Journal activity may take some students
longer to complete. You may wish to plan to give students additional time
to complete their entries before sharing them with the class.

~~**“WHAT MAKES AN INSECT AN INSECT?” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 2A-1: Cockroach**

Hello, boys and girls. The last time you

gathered to learn about insects you were

joined by a fly, an insect with whom you are

surely familiar. I am also a very common insect

that loves to live in bathtubs or underneath





kitchen sinks. My cousins and I often hide

during the day so you may not notice us. Does



anyone know what type of insect I am? I am a cockroach. Do you think I look

anything like a fly?


**Show Image 2A-2: Fly and cockroach**

There are millions of insects on Earth. At

first glance, we may look very different

from one another. What are some of those

differences? ~~_[Pause for students’ responses.]_~~

What are some ways we are the same? ~~_How_~~





~~_are the fly and cockroach the same?_~~

Unit 6 Insects: All Around


**Show Image 2A-3: Butterfly, grasshopper,**
**lice, and fleas (clockwise)**

Some insects, like butterflies and

grasshoppers, have wings, whereas others, like

fleas and **microscopic** lice, don’t. ~~Microscopic~~

~~_means very, very small, something that can_~~

~~_only be seen with a microscope._~~ Some eat

plants and others eat animals, but all insects



have certain features in common. I am here to talk about what makes an

insect an insect.


Our name should give you a clue. ~~_[Say the word_~~ ~~insect~~ ~~_followed by the word_~~

~~section.~~ ~~_] What part of both these words sounds similar?_~~ ~~(~~ ~~_sect_~~ ~~, meaning part)~~

An insect’s body is built in sections, or parts—three parts to be exact. We’ll

use one of my friends, the ant, as an example.









**Show Image 2A-4: Ant with three sections**
**labeled**

~~_[Point to the body parts in the image as you_~~

~~_read about them.]_~~ All insects have a head, a

**thorax,** and an **abdomen.** The head is the

center of an insect’s senses, but different

kinds of insects can have very different
looking heads. The thorax is the middle part of



the insect’s body. The abdomen is the end of the insect’s body, farthest away

from the head.


**Show Image 2A-5: Insect heads**

What do you notice about the heads of these

common insects? Do they look anything like

yours? Do they have eyes? Yes, they do, but

they are different from your eyes. For one

thing, many insects have more than two eyes.





Lesson 2 What Makes an Insect an Insect?
**27**


**Show Image 2A-6: Cricket’s head**

Most insects, like this cricket, have big eyes

located on the side of the head. Many insects

also have smaller, simple eyes on the tops of

their heads. Look closely at this cricket’s head.

Can you see its eyes? Although some insects

see better than others, most insects also use

other senses to get information about their

environments.


**Show Image 2A-7: Bush cricket’s head with**
**focus on its mouth**

Look at this bush cricket. Does it have a

mouth? Yes, its mouth is a small hole at the

front of its head, surrounded by mouthparts.

You and the cricket both use your mouths to

taste and eat. ~~_What are the parts of your mouth_~~

~~_called?_~~ ~~(tongue, teeth, taste buds, lips)~~


**Show Image 2A-8: Cockroach, aphids,**
**mosquito, and bee (clockwise)**

~~_[Point to the image as you read about the specific_~~

~~_insect.]_~~ Look at the variety of insect mouthparts.

Some look like sponges; others look like scissors

or needles. An insect’s mouth is carefully

designed for eating certain types of foods. Some

insects bite and chew solid foods; others suck

liquids; still others pierce their foods.


|Col1|Col2|
|---|---|
||**2A-8**|



**28**



For example, cockroaches like me eat just about anything we can find. We

have two pairs of jaws for biting, cutting, and chewing food well. Other

insects, like the tiny aphids that destroy farmers’ crops, have mouthparts

that look more like drinking straws. They feed by sucking sap from plant

leaves and stems through these tubes.


Look how long and sharp this mosquito’s mouthpart is—just like a needle.

Have you ever been bitten by a mosquito? They love to feed on people, as

well as other animals like horses and birds. Butterflies and bees have long

mouthparts for sucking nectar from flowers. ~~_[Show Image Card 1 (Butterfly).]_~~

~~_Look closely. Can you see this Monarch butterfly’s mouthparts working like a_~~

~~_straw to suck nectar from this flower?_~~


Unit 6 Insects: All Around


**Show Image 2A-9: Variety of insect antennae**

So, now you’ve seen insect eyes and mouths.

What else do you see on the head of these

insects? Ah, yes, those long feelers! Those are

the insects’ **antennae** [/an*ten*ee/], their

most important sense organs. Insect antennae

come in a variety of shapes and sizes and help

insects learn more about their surroundings.


**Show Image 2A-10: Cricket antennae**

These jointed feelers, such as those on this

cricket, are often covered with tiny bristles

and pegs, and some are even quite feathery.

Antennae are primarily used for smell and

touch, although some can pick up sounds or

detect movements in the air. Do you see a

nose on this cricket? No, at least nothing that

looks like your nose. Instead of a nose, the

cricket uses its antennae to smell.



Eyes. Mouth. Antennae. What else might you expect to find on an insect’s

head? What other sensory organs do you have on the side of your head?

Right—ears! Do you see any ears on this cricket? No. The cricket’s ears are

located on its legs, attached to the middle section of the cricket’s body.

~~_What is the middle section of an insect’s body called?_~~


The middle section of an insect’s body is called the thorax. The thorax has three

pairs of jointed legs and usually, but not always, two pairs of wings. Notice I said

pairs. A pair is two of a specific item. If there are three pairs of legs, how many

legs does an insect have altogether? Yes, all insects have six legs.


Let’s take a look at the cricket’s thorax and see if we can spot its ears.


**Show Image 2A-11: Cricket’s thorax and**
**front legs**

Look just below its knee joint on the front leg.

Do you see a smooth patch of skin? That is the

cricket’s eardrum, which is very important for

it communicates with other crickets through

sound. The cricket’s eardrum bends in and out

to catch sound waves so it can communicate

with other crickets.



Lesson 2 What Makes an Insect an Insect?
**29**


**Show Image 2A-12: Grasshopper, bee, and**
**backswimmer beetle**

Insect legs vary according to an insect’s

lifestyle. How do you think the long, muscular,

back legs of a grasshopper might help it?

That’s right—its legs are designed for jumping

to quickly escape danger. Have you ever seen

the fuzzy legs of a honeybee covered with



yellow clumps of pollen that it carries back to its hive? And how do you think

the backswimmer beetle’s pair of long legs help it in its water habitat? Notice

the oar-like shape of the legs that it uses for paddling. ~~_Show students a_~~

~~_picture of an oar. Explain that the specific shape of an oar, a long pole with a_~~

~~_wide paddle at the end, helps propel the insect’s movement._~~


**Show Image 2A-13: Caterpillar with focus on**
**true legs and prolegs**

Caterpillars have three pairs of true legs on

the front part of their bodies, but their long

bodies need extra support so they also have

several pairs of stubby legs in back to help





them cling to stems and leaves. These false

legs are called prolegs. Caterpillars loop along,



grasping stems with their front legs, or true legs, before drawing their bodies

up into a loop to hold on with their hind legs, or prolegs. ~~_So do caterpillars_~~

~~_have six true legs like all other insects?_~~ ~~(yes)~~


**Show Image 2A-14: Dragonfly wings**

Only adult insects have wings, and some

insects don’t have any wings at all. If an insect

does have wings, they are located on the

insect’s middle section, or thorax. Wings allow

insects to move quickly from place to place,





and they are surely one reason insects have

survived in such large numbers for so many



**30**



years. Insect wings may look very different from one another, but a network

of veins supports each wing. ~~_[You may wish to show the veins in your hand or_~~

~~_the veins in a leaf.] Veins carry needed materials to different parts of the body._~~


Unit 6 Insects: All Around


**Show Image 2A-15: Cricket wing**

When it’s quiet at night, especially in the

summertime, you may hear an interesting

chirping noise coming from insects outside.

That sound may be a cricket! Crickets’ wings

have veins. The veins of a male cricket’s wings

are thicker and shaped differently from many

other insects. You’ll learn more another day

about how a cricket uses its wings to make its

unique chirping sounds.


**Show Image 2A-16: Cricket’s abdomen with**
**spiracles**

So far, we’ve looked at an insect’s head and

its thorax. Every insect body is made up of

three sections. What is the name of the third

section? ~~_[Pause for students’ responses.]_~~

The third and largest section is called the

abdomen. Do you have an abdomen? Yes, you



do. Your abdomen is your belly. Like an insect, your abdomen is where you

digest your food, or break it down so your body can use it to grow and stay

healthy. An insect’s abdomen is also the part of its body where the female

produces eggs. The abdomen is also where insects breathe. Like you, insects

need oxygen from the air to live, but they do not have lungs, and they do not

take in air through their noses or mouths.


Instead, if you look closely at this cricket’s abdomen, you will see a line of

tiny holes along its side. That is where insects take in air, containing oxygen,

to breathe.









**Show Image 2A-17: Ant with three sections**
**labeled**

So, what makes an insect an insect? Well, it has

three body parts—head, thorax, and abdomen.

It also has six legs, and most insects have wings.

But that’s not all. All insects are invertebrates,

meaning that they have no backbones. Instead

of having skeletons inside their bodies like you,

insects wear their skeletons on the outside.



Challenge


Show images of different
insects and ask students
to describe the three body
parts—head, thorax, and
abdomen—of each insect.



Lesson 2 What Makes an Insect an Insect?
**31**


**Show Image 2A-18: Insect’s exoskeleton and**
**suit of armor**

These waterproof **exoskeletons**, made

of a tough, flexible material called chitin

[/ kie*t ə n/], protect the insect’s soft insides

like a suit of armor. Just like your backbone

and bones, an insect’s exoskeleton is the thing

to which the insect’s muscles attach.


**Show Image 2A-19: Cockroach**

Here is a picture of another one of my cousins.

We cockroaches were around long before the

Unit 6 Insects: All Around


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.7.F**~~


1. **Inferential.** In this Read-Aloud you heard about and saw pictures of many
different insects. Based on what you heard and the pictures you saw, what
do you think the author was trying to explain in this Read-Aloud? _(The author_
_was trying to explain what makes an insect an insect and that, although there_
_are many different types of insects, they all have certain characteristics.)_


Check for Understanding


**Make a List:** Let’s make a list as a group. What do all insects
have, or what makes an insect an insect? _(All insects have three_
_body parts: head, thorax, abdomen; six legs; and are invertebrates._
_Note that this Read-Aloud also talks about features some insects_
_have, such as wings. You may add these to the list, but make sure_
_students know an insect does not have to have wings to be an_
_insect.)_


       - Record students’ answers on a piece of chart paper, a whiteboard,
or a blackboard.


2. **Evaluative.** In what ways is an insect’s skeleton different from yours? _(It is_
_on the outside of the body and is called the exoskeleton; it is hard like armor.)_
In what ways is it the same? _(They serve the same purpose—protection and_
_support; both are flexible; and both have muscles attached.)_


**Show Image 2A-13: Caterpillar with focus on true legs and prolegs**


3. **Inferential.** How many legs do insects have? _(six)_ This caterpillar has many
more legs than that. Is it an insect? Why or why not? _(Yes; it has six true legs_
_and the rest are prolegs, or false legs.)_


4. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ If you could choose any insect feature
(antennae, special mouth parts, more legs, wings, etc.) to add to your own
body, what would it be? How would it help you? _(Answers may vary, but_
_students should describe the feature and its function accurately.)_

~~**WORD WORK: MICROSCOPIC (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Some insects, like butterflies and
grasshoppers, have wings whereas others, like fleas and microscopic lice,
don’t.”


2. Say the word _microscopic_ with me.


3. If something is microscopic, it is very, very small, so small that you would
need a special tool like a microscope to see it.


4. The germs that cause many diseases are microscopic, so they can’t be seen
with just your eyes.


5. What are some other things that are microscopic? [Ask two or three
students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses:
“Something that is microscopic is . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use an Antonyms activity for follow-up.** The opposite, or antonym, of the
word _microscopic_ is the word _gigantic_ . If _microscopic_ means very, very small,
what do you think _gigantic_ means? _Gigantic_ means very, very large. I am
going to name some things. If what I name is very, very small, say, “That is
microscopic.” If what I name is very, very large, say, “That is gigantic.”


   - a building that is forty stories tall _(That is gigantic.)_


   - an insect that is so small we can’t see it with just our eyes _(That is_
_microscopic.)_

**Show Image 3A-1: Praying mantis**





Hi, boys and girls. It’s time to meet one of the

most fascinating insects on the planet. That’s

me. I’m a praying mantis, named for the way I

hold my two front legs together as though I am

praying. I might look like I am praying, but my

incredibly fast front legs are designed to grab

my food in the blink of an eye!



I’m here to talk to you about the life stages of insects—how insects develop

from birth to adult. Many insects undergo a complete change in shape and

appearance. I’m sure that you are already familiar with how a caterpillar

changes into a butterfly. The name of the process in which a caterpillar

changes, or morphs, into a butterfly is called metamorphosis.


**Show Image 3A-2: Life cycle of a butterfly**

~~_[Point to each stage of the life cycle as you_~~

~~_read about it.]_~~ Some insects, like the butterfly,

pass through four stages in their life cycles:

egg, **larva** [/lar*v ə/ ], **pupa**, and adult. Each

stage looks completely different from the





next. The young never resemble, or look like,

Unit 6 Insects: All Around


their parents and almost always eat something entirely different. The female

insect lays her eggs on a host plant. ~~_or plant on which another organism lives_~~

When the eggs hatch, the larvae [/lar*vee/] that emerge look like worms.

~~_The word_~~ ~~larva~~ ~~_is singular, and the word_~~ ~~larvae~~ ~~_is plural._~~ Different names are

given to different insects in this worm-like stage, and for the butterfly, the

larva stage is called a caterpillar.


**Show Image 3A-3: Insect larvae: maggot,**
**grub, and caterpillar**

Fly larvae are called maggots; ~~_[Point to the_~~

~~_insect on the top left part of the image.]_~~ beetle

larvae are called grubs; ~~_[Point to the insect on_~~

~~_the top right part of the image.]_~~ and the larvae





of butterflies and moths, as you just heard,

are called caterpillars. ~~_[Point to the insect on_~~



~~_the bottom part of the image.]_~~ Larvae feed and grow as quickly as they can.

They also **molt**, or shed their hard exoskeletons, many times as they grow,

because the exoskeletons don’t grow with them. ~~_Based on this sentence,_~~

~~_what does the word_~~ ~~molt~~ ~~_mean?_~~ ~~(to shed or get rid of)~~ In this way, insect

larvae grow larger each time they molt, until they are ready to change into

adult insects.


**Show Image 3A-4: Cocoon (soft silk) and**
**chrysalis (hard case)**

Once the larvae have eaten all that they can

eat, they take a break. Sometimes people call

this next stage a resting stage, but the larvae

are hardly resting. A larva often spins a cocoon

_(You get new clothing.)_
This is similar to molting.






~~_[Point to the image on the left.]_~~ to protect itself

during the pupa stage when it will remain quite



still for several weeks. Inside this shell-like covering, the pupa transforms, or

changes, into something that looks altogether different than before. Some

insects have a soft cocoon for the pupa stage, and some, like the butterfly,

have a harder case called a chrysalis. ~~_[Point to the image on the right.]_~~


Lesson 3 Life Cycles of Insects
**43**


**Show Image 3A-5: Butterfly emerging from**
**chrysalis**

If you have ever seen a butterfly emerge from

its chrysalis, you know how extraordinary

it is to watch the first flutter of its fully

developed butterfly wings. Its wings were

completely invisible before it disappeared

into its seemingly magical chrysalis. It looks



nothing like it did at any of its earlier stages. Scientists call this **progression**,

through four separate stages, a complete metamorphosis. ~~_A progression is_~~

~~_a connected series of events. So, a complete metamorphosis is a progression_~~

~~_of events._~~ I can’t argue with that, can you? The change is indeed complete.

Butterflies, moths, beetles, and flies all undergo a complete metamorphosis.


**Show Image 3A-6: Life cycle of praying**
**mantis: egg case, nymphs emerging, older**
**nymph, adult**

Not all insects change so completely. Some

insects’ young, like mine, are miniature, or

very small, models of their parents after





hatching. They do change, so they do

experience a metamorphosis, but because it

is not a complete change, scientists call it an

incomplete metamorphosis.


|Col1|Col2|
|---|---|
||**3A-6**|



Challenge


Why do you think it
is called incomplete
metamorphosis?



Just like you, the young start off as a smaller version of what they will end up

being. Just as you started off as a baby person and are slowly growing into an

adult person, some young insects slowly grow and change into an adult.


A praying mantis goes through three life stages: egg, **nymph** [/nimf/], and

adult. ~~_[Point to each stage of the life cycle as you read about it.]_~~ In autumn,

the female mantis lays as many as 400 eggs inside an egg case, attached

to a plant. In spring, the eggs hatch. The tiny praying mantis babies emerge

from the egg case. These brand-new hatchlings, or nymphs, don’t quite look

like me, do they? A little later, the nymph resembles me more—the only thing

it is missing is its wings. Even though you can’t see them yet, there are tiny

developing wing buds. These nymphs eat the same sorts of food as I do as an

adult praying mantis—flies, aphids, moths, and other insects—just smaller.


Let’s take a close look at one of these nymphs.


Unit 6 Insects: All Around



**44**


**Show Image 3A-7: Praying mantis nymph**

Can you tell at this stage that it is an insect?

Can you find its head? How many legs are on

its thorax? ~~(six)~~ Can you see how many pairs

of wings it has? ~~_There are two tiny wing buds,_~~

~~_but they are hard to see._~~ ~~I~~ s there a third section

as well? What’s that called? ~~(abdomen)~~


What is the outside skeleton of an insect



called? ~~_[Pause for student answers.]_~~ Right—an exoskeleton. The baby insect,

or nymph, is born with an exoskeleton, but these hard, nonliving coverings

do not grow with the growing praying mantis nymph. As a nymph grows, its

exoskeleton splits open.


**Show Image 3A-8: Praying mantis nymph,**
**molting**

The nymph wriggles out to reveal softer

skin that can stretch and expand before it

hardens. It molts its exoskeleton again and

again, growing a new one as many as ten





times before it reaches adulthood. ~~_What does_~~

~~molt~~ ~~_mean?_~~ The nymph stage often lasts



all summer long. After its final molt, each surviving praying mantis has a

fully developed exoskeleton and full-grown wings like mine. Grasshoppers,

crickets, and cockroaches belong to the group of insects that experience an

incomplete metamorphosis similar to this one.


An insect’s life cycle is quite short compared to yours. In some cases, it

takes only a few weeks. Scientists believe that this is one reason there are so

many insects on the planet. They are forever breeding and need to reproduce

rapidly because they have so many enemies.


Not all insects, however, have short life cycles.


Lesson 3 Life Cycles of Insects
**45**


**Show Image 3A-9: Cicada and molted skin**

The cicada [/s ə *kae*d ə/ ] looks a little like

a grasshopper and is thought to have the

longest life cycle of any insect, ranging from

two to seventeen years. The adult cicada lays

her eggs on twigs. When the eggs hatch, the

nymphs fall to the ground and burrow into the

soil, searching for tree roots. They feed on the

hear how they sound.


**46**



tree’s sweet root sap. Cicadas undergo incomplete metamorphosis, so there

is no pupal stage. The nymphs remain hidden beneath the ground, continuing

to shed their exoskeletons. ~~_[Point to the empty exoskeleton on the right side_~~

~~_of the image.] What is the word that means to shed its exoskeleton?_~~ ~~(~~ ~~_molt_~~ ~~)~~

Once they are fully grown, they make their way to the surface again, shed

their skin one last time, and emerge as winged adults. For some reason, all

of the cicadas in an area emerge at once either every thirteen years or every

seventeen years.


**Show Image 3A-10: Swarm of cicadas**

When the cicadas all emerge, they fly

everywhere, and their calls are very loud. When

hundreds of flying insects swarm through the

air, their buzzing noises are quite loud!





Next time, you will meet some other flying

insects that may also travel in swarms. Can



anyone guess what insects they might be? I’ll give you a clue: Bzzzzzzz . . .

honeybee, and I’m delighted to be here to tell

you a little bit about my everyday world.





Honeybees are quite social. ~~_What does_~~ ~~social~~

~~_mean?_~~ Humans are social, too, which means

that they live together in communities, or



groups, instead of living alone. Social insects live in communities, too.


Most insects are solitary, living alone their entire lives. They are alone when

they hatch from their eggs; they search for food alone; and they find their

own shelter. There are thousands of different kinds of bees on the planet,

and most of them live solitary lives. But honeybees are different. We live

together in organized communities and depend upon one another to live,

solving problems as a team. We gather and share food, build nests together,

**cooperate** ~~_or work together_~~ to raise our young, and help protect one another

from enemies.


**TEKS 2.6.G** Evaluate details read to determine key ideas; **TEKS 2.3.B** Use context within and beyond a sentence to determine

Lesson 4 Social Insects: Bees and Wasps
**55**


**Show Image 4A-2: A natural hive in a tree;**
**bees on a honeycomb; a commercial beehive**
**box; bees swarming a hive box**

Honeybee communities are called **colonies** .

Our colonies are made up of twenty thousand

or more bees. We like to make our nests, or

beehives, in dark places. That’s why you often

see pictures of us buzzing about in the trunks

of hollow trees.


|Col1|Col2|
|---|---|
||**4A-2**|



Challenge


Has anyone ever told you
that you are “as busy as a
bee”? What do you think
this saying means now
that you know more about
bees?


**56**



People use beehive boxes to raise honeybees for honey. Perhaps you’ve seen

these boxes in a field, orchard, or backyard. ~~_[Point to the boxes in the image.]_~~


**Show Image 4A-3: Honeycomb**

Wherever we nest, we build honeycombs. This

amazing structure of layered cells is made

from a waxy substance that we produce in our

abdomens. Can you spot a pattern among the

cells in this honeycomb? ~~_[Pause for students’_~~





~~_responses.]_~~ They are all six-sided.


What purpose do all of these cells serve?



These cells are very important to our lives. Listen carefully and I’ll tell you

how they are important to the many jobs we perform. Remember, I told you

we are very social insects—and very busy. There is lots of work to be done,

and each bee in the colony has its own job to do.


**Show Image 4A-4: Queen bee surrounded by**
**other bees**

Every honeybee colony has a mother called

the queen bee. The queen is always the largest

bee in the hive, and she has only one job to do.

She must lay eggs, lots and lots of eggs. She





must produce more queens for other hives and

make sure there are enough worker bees to do

the work in her own hive.



The queen bee flies from the nest to meet with male bees called **drones** .

Once a drone meets with the queen bee, it has done its job and it dies.

Drones cannot sting because they don’t have stingers.


Unit 6 Insects: All Around


When the queen returns, she lays her eggs, sometimes more than one

thousand eggs a day. Where do you think the queen bee lays all these eggs?

~~_[Pause for students’ responses.]_~~ Right! She returns to the comb to lay them

there in the cells.


The queen then pushes tiny eggs, no bigger than a pinhead, from her

abdomen into the waxy cells of the honeycomb, one egg to each cell. ~~_Which_~~

~~_part of the insect’s body is the abdomen?_~~ ~~(the section at the end, farthest~~

~~away from the head)~~


**Show Image 4A-5: Worker bees**

In just a few days the eggs hatch. The larvae

get fed **pollen** by one of the hive’s female

worker bees. ~~_Pollen is a powder produced by_~~

grow and eventually spin silky cocoons.


**Show Image 4A-6: Bee emerging**
**from cocoon**

Worker bees quickly seal over the small

waxy cells of the honeycomb, protecting the

developing pupa inside each cocoon. Does

this process sound familiar? It should. The

bees are undergoing a change. ~~_In the previous_~~

~~_Read-Aloud, you heard a word that means_~~



~~_the changes an insect goes through during its life cycle. What is the word_~~

~~_that refers to that change? (metamorphosis_~~ ~~)~~ When they emerge from their

cocoons, they will chew their way out of the cells, emerging as full-grown

adults. ~~_Do honeybees undergo complete or incomplete metamorphosis?_~~

~~(complete metamorphosis)~~


Most of the new adults are female worker bees. They only live for a few

months, and they spend their whole lives working hard to keep the hive

running well. They keep the hive clean. They serve as nurse bees, tending to

the larvae. They make new cells and repair old ones, and they store nectar

and pollen that others bring back to the hive. After several weeks working

inside the hive, these hard-working females go outside to serve as guards,

protecting the hive from enemies and bees from other hives. Each hive has

its own special chemical scent, or smell, so it is easy to tell who doesn’t

belong in the hive. ~~_What jobs do the female worker honeybees do?_~~


Lesson 4 Social Insects: Bees and Wasps
**57**


**Show Image 4A-7: Worker bee collecting**
**nectar and close-up of bee’s mouthpart**

Near the end of her life, a worker bee becomes

a forager bee, collecting a sweet juice from

flowers. ~~_A forager is an animal that wanders_~~

~~_over an area in search of food._~~ This juice, or

nectar, is used to make honey. Foraging worker

bees have keen ~~_or sharp_~~ senses of smell and



sight and very good memories. They may visit thousands of flowers each day

to find the best nectar.


**Show Image 4A-8: Honeybee and figure-eight**
**dance pattern**

When a bee discovers a particularly good

source of nectar, it returns to the hive to share

its information with other foragers. First, it lets

the other foragers smell the pollen so they can





identify the type of flower. Then, it performs a

complicated and special waggle dance. As it



circles about in a pattern like a figure eight, it wags its abdomen as it moves

through the middle of its dance. ~~_[Trace the figure eight in the image several_~~

~~_times.]_~~ The bee’s repeated movements, circling and waggling its abdomen,

tell the others exactly how far away and in which direction from the sun the

flowers are located. A bee that thinks she has found a really good flower

patch does the waggle dance with lots of energy. ~~_Why might it be helpful_~~

~~_to the other bees to know how good the source of nectar is?_~~ Where do you

suppose the bees put the nectar when they return to the hive? They make

the nectar into honey and store it in honey cells—the cells that are not being

used for developing bees. The honey is an important food source for the

bees. ~~_What jobs do the forager honeybees do?_~~


**Show Image 4A-9: Bee covered with pollen**

While moving from flower to flower, worker

bees rub up against a yellow powder called

pollen. Honeybees will pack the pollen into

baskets of hairs on their hind legs, and then

they carry it with them. Pollen is used to feed





the larvae, but this pollen is important stuff

for another reason. Plants need pollen from

other plants in order to make new seeds. This


Unit 6 Insects: All Around



**58**


is called pollination. Honeybees are important because they carry the pollen

between flowers of the same species, or kind.


**Show Image 4A-10: Paper wasp**
**and honeybee**

I’d like to introduce you to a relative of mine.

This is a paper wasp. ~~_[Point to the image on_~~

~~_the left.]_~~ Look closely at its body next to mine.

What do we have in common? We each have a





head. We each have a thorax with six legs, an

abdomen, an exoskeleton, and wings. And, this



particular wasp, the paper wasp, is a social insect, just like me. Some wasps

are solitary, but the black and gold ones nearly always live in societies ~~_or_~~

~~_groups_~~ .


Like honeybees, wasps live in large groups. What are these groups called?

Yes, wasps live in colonies. Each colony has a leader, a female wasp who is

bigger than all the other wasps and who spends most of her time laying eggs.

Sound familiar? What is she called? Yes, the queen.


**Show Image 4A-11: Paper wasp nest**

Like honeybees, wasps build nests. They

build them in many different places, usually

in hidden, difficult-to-see places that are

protected from rain and bad weather, such

as under the eaves of houses or in protected





areas on trees. ~~_The eave of a house is a_~~

~~_protected place where the roof and the outside_~~



~~_wall come together, so wasps like to build their nests there._~~ Wasp nests

have a very different look from beehives on the outside, but their paper-like

structures are similar to ours on the inside.


**Show Image 4A-12: Wasp queen forming nest**

We’ll take a look at how paper wasps build

their nests. The process begins with the

queen. She finds plant fibers—dry grasses,

old boards, fence posts—and pulls them apart

with her strong jaws. She softens the splintery





pieces with saliva inside her mouth and chews



Lesson 4 Social Insects: Bees and Wasps
**59**


them into a paste that looks and feels a little like paper. Then she sticks a

dab of this paste to whatever surface she has chosen for her nest. The queen

adds a tough stem to support the whole nest and begins attaching cone-like

chambers to it. These clusters of six-sided chambers open downward to keep

the rain out.


**Show Image 4A-13: Queen wasp placing eggs**
**in nest**

As the queen forms each chamber, she

deposits an egg in each one. The eggs develop

into larvae. The queen wasp takes care of the

first larvae herself. She leaves the nest to find





food, capturing and chewing other insects

into mush to feed her young. About two weeks



after hatching, the larvae enter the pupa stage, spinning cocoons inside each

cell and covering the cells with silk. ~~_What jobs does the queen paper wasp do?_~~


**Show Image 4A-14: Adult wasp emerging**
**from cell**

These sealed cells break open a few weeks

later and out come adult wasps with long legs,

strong wings, and large eyes. Most of these

newly hatched wasps are female workers who





begin to take over the queen’s work right away.

They hunt for food and feed the larvae, clean



and repair the cells, and guard the nest. Others fan the nest with beating

wings, and some even spread water over the combs to keep the nests cool.

While the workers enlarge the nest for more and more wasps, the queen goes

back to laying eggs. ~~_What jobs do the female worker wasps do?_~~


**Show Image 4A-15: Large paper wasp nest**

By summer’s end, many of the workers

have died. There are often 250 or more cells

inside the wasp’s papery nest. The wasps

that do emerge at the end of summer are no

longer female worker wasps. Instead, they





are new queens and males. The new queens

find shelter in protected places—in attic

walls, inside logs, under bushes—where they


Unit 6 Insects: All Around



**60**


hibernate all winter. When spring comes, the new queens come out from

hiding and begin building nests for new colonies of wasps.


All wasps abandon their nests in fall, using them for one season only. When

fall comes and the leaves drop from the trees, look up and see if you can spot

one of their papery apartment houses dangling from under a roof or partially

hidden behind a wall.


Next time you’ll find out how some other social insects build their nests.

Until then, be thinking about who they might be.

honeybees. Write _Honeybees_ or _Paper Wasps_ at the top of the page as the
title for your journal entry.


3. On the next page of your journal, draw a picture of honeybees or paper wasps
showing how they work together as a colony (e.g., show the honeycomb or
nest, and the various jobs of different bees or wasps). Encourage students to
label their drawings (e.g., honeycomb, queen bee, nest, etc.).


4. Then, write a description of your drawing using complete sentences below
your drawing. In your description, explain how the insects are social and how
the insect colony works together.

~~**“SOCIAL INSECTS: ANTS AND TERMITES” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 5A-1: Black garden ant**

Hi there, everybody. Because I’m one of the

most common insects on the planet, I’m sure

you know that I’m an ant. But, did you realize

how much my cousins and I look like a wasp?

Take a close look.







**Show Image 5A-2: Ant and wasp**

See how slender, or thin, our waists are? Mine

is unusually flexible, making it easy to bend

and twist. Count my body parts. You’ll see that

I have three, just like all other insects—my

head with its long antennae, my thorax, and

my abdomen. ~~_[Have student volunteers point_~~

~~_to those parts of the insect in the image.]_~~



Here’s something you might not know: I have two stomachs! Both are located

in my abdomen, but one is for my own digestion and the other, called the

crop, is just a storage bin where I keep food for other ants.


The fact that I store food for other ants should tell you something about me.

~~_What does this tell you about ants?_~~ Ants are social insects. We raise and care

for our young in ant colonies. There are many different kinds of ants with

many different ways of life.


**TEKS 2.6.G** Evaluate details read to determine key ideas; **TEKS 2.3.B** Use context within and beyond a sentence to determine

~~_[Point to each ant as you read about it, going_~~

~~_from left to right on each line, top to bottom.]_~~

Carpenter ants build their nests in wood.

Leafcutter ants grow fungus on the leaves

they cut in vast, or very large, underground

gardens. ~~_A fungus is a type of living organism—_~~

~~_not a plant or animal. Mold is of one kind of_~~

~~_fungus._~~ The **aggressive** weaver ants live in leaves they bind together in trees.

~~Aggressive~~ ~~_means forceful or ready to attack._~~ The huge colonies of army ants

travel in groups, eating everything in sight. Trap-jaw ants can jump distances

of more than twelve inches! ~~_[Demonstrate the width of twelve inches with_~~

~~_your hands.]_~~ Harvester ants build huge nest mounds where they store seeds.

Beware of the red fire ants—they sting!


I am a black garden ant, the type that you may see most often, so that is the

kind of ant I am going to tell you about today. Like many other ants, we live in

underground tunnels, or passageways.


**Show Image 5A-4: Underground ant tunnels**
**with chambers**

Bees have honeycombs, paper wasps have

paper nests, and we have tunnels—miles and

miles of tunnels, full of little **chambers**, or

rooms—hundreds of very dark chambers. A





colony may have as few as twelve ants or as

many as a million or more. The center of an



ant colony’s life is this nest of tunnels.


**Show Image 5A-5: Winged queen ant**

An ant colony begins with the queen. A young

queen is born in one colony but leaves that

colony to start her own. Her wings carry her into

the air to find a male ant. After this, she sheds

her wings and immediately finds a nesting place





underground. There she builds a chamber and

seals herself inside to lay her eggs.


Unit 6 Insects: All Around



**70**


**Show Image 5A-6: Stages of development:**
**egg, larva, pupa, adult**

When ant larvae hatch, the queen cares for the

first brood herself, feeding them with her own

saliva as they change from wormlike larvae

into pupae and, finally, adults. The queen does

not leave the nest this whole time, getting

nutrition from her now-useless wing muscles

in order to survive.



Ants undergo a complete metamorphosis. ~~_What is a metamorphosis?_~~ ~~(a~~

~~change)~~ ~~_What are the four stages in complete metamorphosis?_~~ ~~(egg, larva,~~

~~pupa, adult)~~ Most of the eggs eventually develop into small female worker

ants that begin their lifetime of hard work by gathering food for the queen,

making sure she is well fed. The queen will never leave the nest again, living

there for ten to twenty years, perhaps even longer. As the mother of the

colony, she has her own special chamber. Her only job from this point on is to

lay eggs.


**Show Image 5A-7: Worker ants feeding larvae**

The worker ants carry the eggs from the

queen’s chamber into **nurseries** where they

keep the eggs clean and moist by licking them

until they hatch. ~~_Nurseries are places to breed_~~

~~_and care for young animals or plants._~~ Then





they carry the larvae into separate chambers

to feed them.



Black ants eat other insects, any crumbs that we can find, and the honeydew

of aphids. ~~_[Show Image Card 14 (ants tending aphids).] Honeydew is a sugary_~~

~~_liquid made by the aphids. The ants collect the honeydew and protect the_~~

~~_aphids from predators._~~ We chew the food up well and put it in a pouch in our

mouths where the liquid is squeezed out of it. We spit out the solid parts and

swallow the liquid. Remember, we have two stomachs, one being a crop for

storing food, so worker ants come back to the nest with crops full of food for

the young.


Lesson 5 Social Insects: Ants and Termites
**71**


**Show Image 5A-8: Ant pupae**

As they grow, the larvae molt a few times and

after a few weeks they spin cocoons. ~~_What_~~

~~_does it mean when insects molt?_~~ ~~(They shed~~

~~their skins to grow.)~~ The worker ants move

these newly formed pupae into much drier

chambers where they rest until they are ready

to gnaw their way out into the world.



Support


Ask students to think of
examples of ways your
class cooperates to get
things done.



As social insects, ants cooperate in many ways. ~~_What does_~~ ~~cooperate~~ ~~_mean?_~~

~~(work together)~~ When these new workers emerge, some will help care for the

queen and larvae, and some will build and repair the tunnels, while others will

guard the nest.


**Show Image 5A-9: Soldier ant guarding**
**a nest**

These guards, called soldier ants, have larger

heads and jaws than the other ants, and they

place their bodies across the entrance to the

nest to defend the colony. All ants, including





soldier ants, **emit** ~~_or give off_~~ chemical signals

that other ants smell with their antennae.



Soldier ants use these signals to warn the colony of danger. This is one

way that ants communicate, or share information.


**Show Image 5A-10: Ants communicating**

Another way ants communicate is through

touch. If an ant is hungry, it taps a food

gatherer lightly with its antennae to let it

know that it would like to eat.





They exchange the food mouth-to-mouth

in what looks like little kisses. When food is

shared, the ants also share and pass along



**72**



some chemical information important for the entire colony. If one of us ants

gets trapped when the soil around us caves in, we produce a squeaky sound

by rubbing joints together and other ants “hear” the cry for help through

their legs.


Unit 6 Insects: All Around


**Show Image 5A-11: Termites and cockroach**

Before I leave, I want to introduce you to

another social insect that some people

mistakenly call white ants. Do you think

these look like ants? They’re not. They are

termites. Termites are more closely related to

cockroaches and yet they do not have hard

exoskeletons. They are soft-bodied and nearly



blind. They would not survive as solitary insects on their own, but they are

very successful social insects.


There are several differences between termites and the other social insects

you have learned about—honeybees, paper wasps, and ants. Termites do

not go through as many stages of development. They skip the pupa stage so

their metamorphosis is incomplete.


**Show Image 5A-12: Termite queen**

Termite society is a bit different as well. Both

a king and a queen rule termite colonies. They

start a colony together. The queen is the most

important member of the colony, sometimes

laying six or seven thousand eggs a day. She is





so well protected by the countless numbers of

worker termites that it is almost impossible to



find her within the colony. Just in case something should happen to the royal

couple, termite colonies include substitute kings and queens as well.


**Show Image 5A-13: Termite soldiers**

Termite workers perform jobs similar to the

worker ants’ jobs, but the job of guarding the

colony rests with a small number of soldiers,

equipped with strong legs and long powerful

jaws. Unlike honeybees, paper wasps, and





ants, where all the workers are female, in

termite colonies, both male and female

workers are important members of society.



Lesson 5 Social Insects: Ants and Termites
**73**


**Show Image 5A-14: Termites chewing**
**on wood**

Termites’ favorite food is wood. They can be

very **destructive** if they choose to eat through

the walls of a house! ~~Destructive~~ ~~_means they_~~

~~_cause a lot of damage or harm._~~ Depending

on where they live, some termite species eat

insects, waste materials, and fungus. They



build their temperature-controlled nests underground, inside fallen trees,

in timber, and in tree branches.


**Show Image 5A-15: Termite nest in a tree and**
**termite mound**

~~_[Point to the image on the left.]_~~ Does this nest

look a bit like a wasp nest? I think so. It’s made

of chewed wood and saliva like a wasp nest,

but with added mud and soil.





**74**



Some termites build mounds above ground

to house their colonies. ~~_[Point to the image on_~~

~~_the right.]_~~ These towering mud structures are hard as rock and some are as

tall as a two-story house. Lots of teamwork goes into building these mounds

with incredible air-conditioning systems to keep the chambers cool in very

hot climates.


Next time you’ll hear from an insect that glows in the dark. Until then, be

thinking about who that might be.


Unit 6 Insects: All Around


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Inferential.** The author of this Read-Aloud made the statement that ants
are social insects. What reasons, or facts, did the author give to support
this statement? _(Ants live and work together cooperatively in colonies with_
_specialized jobs.)_


Check for Understanding


**Make a List:** Let’s make a list as a group. What jobs do ants and/
or termites have that contribute to the colony? _(The queen builds_
_tunnels and lays eggs; workers feed the young and repair tunnels;_
_soldiers guard the nest.)_


      - Record students’ answers on a piece of chart paper, a chalkboard,
or a whiteboard.


      - Ask students how those jobs make ants and/or termites social.
_(They have to work together for the good of the community.)_


2. **Evaluative.** How are termites and ants different? _(Termites have incomplete_
_metamorphosis, whereas ants have complete metamorphosis; termites have_
_multiple kings and queens, whereas ants have only one queen; male termites_
_serve the colony in many ways, whereas the only role of a male ant is to_
_produce young with the queen.)_


3. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ Many people stack firewood on their wooden
porches so it is handy to transport into the house to make fires when it is
cold outside. Given what you know about the termite’s eating habits, do you
think that is a good idea? Why or why not? _(Answers may vary, but should_
_reference the fact that termites eat wood and might begin harming the porch_
_or the house if they are close to it.)_

**76**



~~**WORD WORK: DESTRUCTIVE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “[Termites] can be very destructive if they
choose to eat through the walls of a house!”


2. Say the word _destructive_ with me. What do you think this word means? What
words or phrases from the Read-Aloud make you think that?


3. If something is destructive, it causes great damage or harm.


4. Hurricanes can be very destructive storms.


5. Can you think of something that is destructive? Try to use the word
_destructive_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses: “ is/are destructive.”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** A word that is an antonym,
or has the opposite meaning, of _destructive_, is the word _constructive._
_Constructive_ means helpful or making something better. I am going to
describe some scenarios. If what I describe is an example of something
that is destructive, or causes harm, say, “That is destructive.” If what I
describe is an example of something that is constructive, or that is helpful,
say, “That is constructive.”


   - The engineers built a new bridge over the river. _(That is constructive.)_


   - I helped my little sister learn to tie her shoe. _(That is constructive.)_


   - The puppy chewed through my mother’s new shoes. _(That is destructive.)_


   - The ocean wave destroyed the sand castle I built on the beach.
_(That is destructive.)_


   - We helped plant flowers in the garden. _(That is constructive.)_

student represent a different stage of development for their given insect.
Have students practice in their small groups.


  - Next, tell students each group will perform for the class. Have students
regroup according to the part they played in the development of the insects
(all eggs will be together, all nymphs, all larvae, etc.). Tell them that you are
going to describe each developmental stage in one sentence (i.e., first you
will describe the egg stage, second you will describe the nymph stage, etc.).


    - I am the first stage of development in all insects. I am laid by an adult and
remain rather helpless, unable to move until I change forms. _(egg, both_
_complete and incomplete metamorphosis)_


    - I am the second stage of development, following the egg, and resemble,
or look like, my parent. _(nymph, incomplete metamorphosis)_


    - I am the second stage of development, following the egg, and do not look
at all like my parent. Rather, I am wormlike in appearance. _(larva, complete_
_metamorphosis)_


    - I am the third and final stage of development, following the nymph stage.
_(adult, incomplete metamorphosis)_


**TEKS 2.1.B** Follow, restate, and give oral instructions that involve a short, related sequence of actions.

   - I am the third, seemingly quiet, stage of development, following the larval
stage. _(pupa, complete metamorphosis)_


   - I am the fourth and final stage of development, following the pupal stage.
_(adult, complete metamorphosis)_


**Insect Research**


Materials: Insects Journals; trade books; other resources as needed

 - Have students check their Insects Journals to see if there are any questions
they have about insects that have not been answered.


 - Allow them to search through the trade books in the classroom library to look
for answers.


 - You may also wish to allow them to research using the library and other
locally approved resources.


 - Have students write in their journals any information that either answers a
question or that they find interesting. As time allows, have students share
what they find with the class.


**Riddles for Core Content**

 - Ask the students riddles such as the following to review core content:


   - Most insects begin their life cycle inside of me. What am I? _(an egg)_


   - We help most insects to smell and feel. What are we? _(antennae)_


   - We help most insects to fly, escape from predators, and look for food. What
are we? _(wings)_


   - All insects have six of us. What are we? _(legs)_


   - I am the hard outer skeleton of all insects. What am I? _(an exoskeleton)_


   - We are the three main body parts of insects. What are we? _(head, thorax,_
_and abdomen)_


   - We are types of insects that work and live together in communities. What
are we? _(social insects)_


   - We do things on our own and do not live and work in communities. What
are we? _(solitary insects)_


 - You may wish to have students create their own riddles about insects to pose
to the class, based on what they have learned thus far.


Unit 6 Insects: All Around


**Drawing Insects**


Materials: Drawing paper, drawing tools

  - Have students draw their favorite insect. Tell them to be sure to label the six
legs and the three body parts: head, thorax, and abdomen.


  - Allow students to share their drawings with the class.


  - You may also ask students why a spider is not considered an insect, and why
they would not draw a spider for this activity. _(Spiders have eight legs, rather_
_than six like insects have.)_


**Keeping Insects in the Classroom**


Materials: Insects, their homes,and their food (will vary)


**Note:** Many insect species are available through science catalogues such as
Carolina Biological Supply. Before deciding to keep or raise non-native species
of insects, you may wish to consider that it is important they not be released
into the environment, as they can disrupt the local ecosystem. You may wish to
donate them to another classroom or to a local science museum.


  - You may wish to keep insects in the classroom for students to observe and
care for. Many insects are interesting and will enhance the themes of this
unit. Check first with the school’s policy about insects in the classroom.


  - Giant peppered roaches ( _Archimandrita tesselata_ ) can be kept successfully
for long periods of time. These are attractive, large (2” to 3”), and long-lived
insects. They are not smelly, can be fed on apples and cat chow, and are
easily handled by students.


  - Walking sticks can be raised on oak leaves, roses, or romaine lettuce.


  - Praying mantises are less hardy and, because they are predators, require
more attention to keep them fed.


  - Mealworms can be raised in small containers and their life cycle observed.
They are easy to feed on oats and potato slices, though the oat substrate and
the potatoes need to be replaced periodically to prevent mold.


  - You may be able to find Monarch butterfly caterpillars and watch the amazing
and beautiful progression as each forms its chrysalis and then emerges as an
adult Monarch.


  - There are many enjoyable insects for students to observe. You may wish to
do more research on keeping these insects or others in your classroom.


**Note:** You may wish to extend this exercise by having students write and
share a brief report about a specific insect.


Pausing Point

**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**


Materials: Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard

 - Give students a key unit concept or vocabulary word such as _exoskeleton._
Have them brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear the
word, such as _external skeleton, protective covering, waterproof,_ etc.


 - Record their responses on chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard for
reference.


**Insect Videos**

 - You may wish to search the Internet, or purchase or rent videos about
insects. Alternatively, your school and local libraries and science
departments may have resources available. Show portions of videos to
support the concepts in this unit.


**Insect Habitats**

 - Have students discuss all of the different types of habitats where insects live.
Emphasize that because there are so many different types of insects, they
live in all kinds of places.


 - Allow students to share stories of places where they have seen insects.
Remind them that there are more insects than any other animal on Earth.


**On Stage**

 - Have students act out particular insects, and have the rest of the students
guess which insect it is.


 - You may wish to allow the student to give clues such as, “I’m a solitary
insect,” or “I’m a very harmful insect,” etc.


**Writing Prompts**

 - Students may be given an additional writing prompt such as the following:


   - My favorite insect is . . .


   - One thing I don’t like about insects is . . .


   - Some ways that insects are helpful are . . .


   - Some ways that insects are harmful are . . .


**Insect Hunt**

 - Take the class outside to see how many insects they can find.


 - Have students observe the insects and draw and/or write notes in their
Insects Journals.


Unit 6 Insects: All Around


  - You may also choose to bring insects into the classroom to observe, perhaps
under a microscope.


**Image Review**

  - Show the Flip Book images from any Read-Aloud again, and have students
retell information from the Read-Aloud using the images.


**Image Card Review**


Materials: Image Cards 1–13

  - In your hand, hold Image Cards 1–13 fanned out like a deck of cards. Ask a
student to choose a card but to not show it to anyone else in the class.


  - The student must then perform an action or give a clue about the picture he
or she is holding. For example, for a card with a butterfly, the student could
flap their arms and pretend to “fly” around the room.


  - The rest of the class will guess what is being described.


  - Proceed to another card when the correct answer has been given.


  - Be sure to “wrap the language” around this activity, reminding students of
key unit-related vocabulary they have learned.


**Unit-Related Trade Book or Student Choice**


Materials: Trade book

  - Read a trade book to review a particular insect or concept about insects.


  - You may also choose to have the students select a Read-Aloud to be
heard again.


**Class Book**


Materials: Drawing paper, drawing tools

  - Tell the class or a group of students that they are going to make a class book
to help them remember what they have learned about insects thus far in this
unit.


  - Have students brainstorm important information about the different types,
characteristics, and life cycles of insects, and which insects are solitary or
social.


  - Have each student choose one idea to draw a picture about, and ask them to
write a caption for the picture.


  - Bind the pages to make a class book to put in the class library for students to
read again and again.

###### Read-Aloud



**Reading:** Students will explain how different insects communicate with one
another. ~~**TEKS 2.6.G**~~


~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED? (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students to name the common characteristics of all insects. (six legs;
three body parts: head, thorax, and abdomen; an exoskeleton; two antennae;
and sometimes wings)


  - Ask students how the insects they have learned about so far (specifically
crickets, honeybees, and ants) communicate or exchange information with
one another. You may wish to reread the following passages from previous
Read-Alouds to help students remember.


**Show Image 2A-11: Cricket’s thorax and front legs**


_Look just below its knee joint on the front leg. Do you see a smooth_
_patch of skin? That is the cricket’s eardrum, which is very important_
_as it communicates with other crickets through sound. The cricket’s_
_eardrum bends in and out to catch the sound waves so it can_
_communicate with other crickets._


**Show Image 4A-8: Honeybee and figure-eight dance pattern**


_When a bee discovers a particularly good source of nectar, it returns_
_to the hive to share its information with other foragers. First, it lets_
_the other foragers smell the pollen so they can identify the type of_
_flower. Then, it performs a complicated and special waggle dance. As_
_it circles about in a pattern like a figure eight, it wags its abdomen as it_
_moves through the middle of its dance. The bee’s repeated movements,_
_circling and waggling its abdomen, tell the others exactly how far away_
_and in which direction from the sun the flowers are located. A bee that_
_thinks she has found a really good flower patch does the waggle dance_
_with lots of energy._

**Show Image 5A-9: Soldier ant guarding a nest**


_All ants, including soldier ants, emit chemical signals that other ants_
_smell with their antennae. Soldier ants use these signals to warn the_
_colony of danger. This is one way that ants communicate, or share_
_information._


**Show Image 5A-10: Ants communicating**


_Another way ants communicate is through touch. If an ant is hungry, it_
_taps a food gatherer lightly with its antennae to let it know that it would_
_like to eat._


_They exchange the food mouth-to-mouth in what looks like little_
_kisses. When food is shared, the ants also share and pass along some_
_chemical information important for the entire colony. If one of us ants_
_gets trapped when the soil around us caves in, we produce a squeaky_
_sound by rubbing joints together and other ants “hear” the cry for help_
_through their legs._


 - Tell students they are going to learn how some other insects communicate.


 - Tell students that today’s Read-Aloud is called “Insects that Glow and Sing.”
The insects they will learn about today communicate by glowing in the dark
and singing to one another.

~~**“INSECTS THAT GLOW AND SING” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 6A-1: Firefly with well-**
**illuminated light**

Can you blink, boys and girls? So can I. Does

your abdomen light up when you blink? No?

Are you sure? How can you tell? If you’re

blinking, perhaps you just can’t see. Turn to





your neighbor and ask them to watch your

abdomen while you blink. Did it glow? No?



Well, I’m not really surprised. If humans were able to produce their own

light, they might never have invented the electric light bulb. We fireflies have

been around long before electricity or even candles. Our light organs, called

**lanterns**, are located in our transparent, or see-through, abdomens. On

fireflies, lanterns are the body part that produces light.


**Show Image 6A-2: Fireflies lighting up**
**a forest**

When humans first discovered us lighting up

the forests, they were amazed by how much

light we produced. In ancient China and Japan,

people collected us in transparent jars and

**92**



dark. ~~_What does_~~ ~~transparent~~ ~~_mean?_~~ ~~(see-through)~~ They named us fireflies.

But we are not flies at all, and our light—unlike a fire—is cold.


“Cold light” is the way your ancestors explained our beautiful, magical light.

Scientists now know that chemical reactions create the light, and they

describe this process with a much bigger word. They call it **bioluminescence**

[/bie*oe*loo*m ə *nes* ə ns/]. Can you say that? _Bio_ means living and _lumin_

means light. I think that’s a good name for it, don’t you? We are living lights!


**Show Image 6A-3: Bioluminescence in**
**the ocean**

Other animals and plants glow, or light up like

tiny electric bulbs, but most of them live in the

ocean. Certain types of squid, jellyfish, corals,

and even sharks glow beneath the water.





Plants such as algae in the ocean can also

glow on the surface of the water. At times, this



bioluminescence is so bright that it looks as if someone flipped a light switch

beneath the water.


It’s less common to find land animals that glow, or give off light. I’ve told you

that we are called fireflies, but do any of you call us by another name? We’re

also called lightning bugs. But we are neither flies nor bugs. We are beetles—

another group of insects. Take a close look and see.


**Show Image 6A-4: Lightning bug**

Like all insects, we have three body parts

(head, thorax, and abdomen); six legs; two

antennae; an exoskeleton; and, like most

insects, two pairs of wings. ~~_[Have student_~~

~~_volunteers point to these body parts in the_~~

**Show Image 6A-5: Firefly larvae**

We undergo a complete metamorphosis—

changing from egg to larva to pupa to adult.

~~_What is a complete metamorphosis?_~~ ~~(A~~

~~change that is so big that the insect looks~~

~~completely different after.)~~ Some of our eggs

and larvae even glow! Have you ever heard of a


Unit 6 Insects: All Around


glowworm? Glowworms are also misnamed. They are not worms at all.

~~_At what stage do insects look like worms?_~~ ~~(as larvae)~~ The larvae of fireflies

and other insects are often called glowworms because they live on the

ground like worms do, and they glow in the dark.


**Show Image 6A-6: Firefly bioluminescence**

In order for any animals to survive, they must

reproduce, or have babies. Male fireflies

flash very specific signals to females who sit

patiently and wait to meet them. The males fly

through the dark, flashing very specific signals





to females who sit patiently and wait for them.

Our yellowish-green lights stand out against



the night sky as we signal one another with special codes. When a female

recognizes a male’s code as being from the same species, ~~_or type_~~ she flashes

the same code back to him and the male lands beside her.


Have you ever noticed how some fireflies flash close to the ground with

one pattern, but others seem to be higher in the air with a different flash

pattern at a slightly later time of night? These are males of different species

attracting their own females. Watch us next summer and you will see what

I mean.


**Show Image 6A-7: Grasshopper**

~~_Who has been narrating the Read-Aloud up to_~~

~~_this point?_~~ ~~(a firefly)~~ ~~_Based on the image, who_~~

~~_do you think will be narrating now?_~~ Hi there. I

bet you’re surprised to see me today. I’m not

bioluminescent. I don’t glow, but I do sing.





That’s what I want to talk to you about today—

other ways that insects **communicate**, or

share information.



Fireflies are silent communicators, flashing their glowing lights back

and forth. ~~_What is the firefly’s light organ called?_~~ ~~(a lantern)~~ How do you

communicate with one another? You talk, don’t you? And what do you use

to talk? Your mouths, of course! Although we insects use mouths for eating,

just like you, we have no vocal cords, or voice boxes, so we don’t use them

for talking and singing. Even so, we grasshoppers can be a noisy bunch. Have

you ever heard grasshoppers sing on a summer day? You won’t hear any


Lesson 6 Insects that Glow and Sing
**93**


words, but you will definitely hear a chorus of sounds. Just like birds, each

type of grasshopper produces a different song. If you listen closely, you can

tell what type of grasshopper is singing by its song.


**Show Image 6A-8: Grasshopper’s tympanum**

Nearly all grasshoppers have two pairs of

wings, but we seldom use them for flying

because we spend so much of our lives low

to the ground. Male grasshoppers use their

wings for communicating with one another.





Female grasshoppers do not sing, but they

listen very carefully. They hear our sounds with



tympanum, eardrums on the sides of their abdomens. ~~_[Point to the abdomen_~~

~~_in the image. The tympanum is located near where the thorax and abdomen_~~

~~_come together, close to where the muscular hind legs attach to the thorax.]_~~


**Show Image 6A-9: Grasshopper’s wings**

Grasshoppers, locusts, and crickets all make

sounds by rubbing body parts together,

sometimes two wings and sometimes a leg

and a wing.





To make sounds, I lift my wings and rub the

front wings together. ~~_[Point to the wings as_~~

~~_you read this paragraph.]_~~ The vein, composed

of many tiny teeth, on the bottom of one wing rubs against the sharp edge,

or scraper, on the top of the other wing. It is a little like rubbing your fingers

along the teeth of a comb. As the two parts rub together, the wings vibrate,

moving back and forth rapidly to produce the sounds that you hear.


**Show Image 6A-10: Katydid**

You may be familiar with my cousin, the

katydid. Katydids have long antennae, just like

me. As they rub their front wings together, it

sounds like they are calling out “Katy did, Katy

did.” Their high-pitched calls become faster





and faster as the outside temperature rises.

Some people even say that you can tell how

hot it is by the number of times per second


Unit 6 Insects: All Around


a katydid chirps. If katydids live in your part of Texas and you are patient

enough, you may want to try counting the number of chirps you hear every

five seconds. Add thirty-nine to that number and you may have an accurate

reading of the temperature, depending on the species of katydid you are

hearing.


**Show Image 6A-11: Cricket cage and cricket**

In some Asian countries, in a tradition that has

been practiced for thousands of years, male

crickets have been kept in cages as singing

pets. Do you know where the ears of a cricket

are located? You may remember that female





grasshoppers hear with special parts on their

abdomens, but crickets have “ears” on their



forelegs. ~~_The front legs of animals are called forelegs._~~ Both places must seem

a little strange to you since your ears are on the sides of your head.


Before I leave today, I want to introduce you to another singing insect. These

insects are often mistaken for grasshoppers and crickets because they look

a lot like us.


**Show Image 6A-12: Cicada**

Does anyone remember what this insect is

called? This is a cicada [/s ə *kae*d ə/ ]. Cicadas

are related to aphids, leafhoppers, and

spittlebugs. Unlike grasshoppers and crickets,

many cicadas have strong wings and are fast









fliers. Male cicadas produce incredibly loud

songs, but they do not use their legs and wings

to make those sounds.


**Show Image 6A-13: Cicada with**
**tymbals labeled**

Look closely at the abdomen of a cicada. On its

underside, close to the thorax, a cicada has a

pair of sound-producing organs called tymbals

[/tim*b ə lz/]. These ribbed membranes are a

little like the skin of a drum. The cicada uses

its muscles to vibrate these drum-like organs.

Provide students with a
specific sentence frame
(e.g., “To communicate,

~~**ELPS 2.G; ELPS 2.I**~~


**96**



~~Vibrate~~ ~~_means to move back and forth very fast._~~ The tymbals pop and click

as they move in and out. Their sound is amplified, or made louder, inside the

mostly hollow abdomen, acting like a drum and creating a loud buzzing song.

The shrill sound of hundreds or thousands of cicadas singing together on a

warm summer evening may be very, very loud.


Grasshoppers, crickets, and cicadas all use sound to communicate in much

the same way that fireflies use their lights. Males attract females for the

purpose of producing young, making sure that these winged insects will

continue to survive.


Next time you gather to discuss insects, you will learn about the largest

group of insects on Earth. Can anyone guess what that might be?


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


Check for Understanding


**Turn and Talk:** Name an insect and describe how that insect
communicates. You may wish to prompt students by giving them a
list of insects from which to choose:


       - firefly _(uses lanterns)_


     - grasshopper _(sings by rubbing wings or wings and legs together_
_and listens using tympanum)_


      - katydid _(sings by rubbing front legs together)_


      - cricket _(sings and listens with forelegs)_


      - cicada _(vibrates tymbals to make a loud noise)_


Unit 6 Insects: All Around


1. **Inferential.** The female grasshoppers use their tympanum, or eardrums on
the sides of their abdomens, to listen to the male grasshoppers. Why do the
males sing to the females? _(They are communicating with them.)_


2. **Inferential.** You heard in the Read-Aloud about a tradition in some Asian
countries where crickets are kept in cages. Is it males or females that are
caged? Why are they caged? _(Males; so people can hear them sing.)_


3. **Inferential.** Do grasshoppers, crickets, and fireflies all have exoskeletons?
How do you know? _(Yes, they are all insects and all insects have_
_exoskeletons.)_

**Show Image 6A-9: Grasshopper’s wings**

  - Explain what adverbs are, using an example from the Read-Aloud.


    - We know that many verbs are action words. Today we will practice using
adverbs, which are words that are used to describe verbs.


    - Grasshoppers sing. _Sing_ is an action word. What words could we use to
describe how grasshoppers sing? ( _loudly, softly, etc.)_ For example, we
could say, “Grasshoppers sing loudly or grasshoppers sing softly.”


    - The words that describe how grasshoppers sing are called adverbs.
Adverbs are words that describe verbs, or action words.


  - Have students identify an adverb in a sentence from the Read-Aloud.


    - In the Read-Aloud you heard that grasshoppers’ wings move rapidly to
make sounds.


    - What do grasshoppers’ wings do? _(move)_ What word is used to describe
how the wings move in this sentence? _(rapidly, which means quickly)_
_Rapidly_ is the adverb that is used to describe how grasshoppers’ wings
move.


  - Have students repeat clapping motions after you as they describe the
clapping using adverbs, such as _clap quickly, clap slowly, clap loudly,_ etc.


    - We can use adverbs to describe how we move, too. See how I wave, and
repeat it after me. What words, or adverbs, could we use to describe how
we are waving?

Unit 6 Insects: All Around


By the end of today, you will know a lot about these amazingly diverse

insects. ~~Diverse~~ ~~_means a group of things that are different._~~ They come in all

shapes, sizes, and colors.


~~_[Point to each image as you read the next sentence.]_~~ Beetles include fireflies,

weevils, whirligigs, and rhinoceros beetles. You already know what makes an

insect an insect. ~~_What makes an insect an insect?_~~ ~~(All have a head, thorax,~~

~~abdomen, antennae, six legs, a hard exoskeleton, and many have wings.)~~

So what makes a beetle a beetle?


First of all, because beetles are insects, we share the same characteristics

as all insects. We have a head, a thorax, and an abdomen. We have antennae,

six legs, a hard exoskeleton, and wings. Most beetles undergo a complete

metamorphosis. ~~_What is a complete metamorphosis? (A change so big that_~~

~~_the insect looks completely different.)_~~


What else do all beetles have in common? Beetles stand out in the insect

world because of our heavy **armor**, or protective covering. In addition to

our exoskeletons, our wings provide protection. Most beetles have two pairs

of wings, but our front wings are not really wings at all. These thick, hard

protective coverings are called elytra [el*i*tr ə ].


**Show Image 7A-4: Ladybug at rest and**
**ladybug in flight**

When we’re resting, we tuck our delicate back

wings under our elytra, or front wings, so that

you cannot see them at all. Then, when we are

ready to fly, we unlock our elytra and unfold





our long, thin back wings. Our elytra provide

lift like the wings of an airplane, but they

remain quite still as our back wings beat up

and down in flight.



Scientists believe one reason insects have survived, or continued to live, in

such huge numbers on Earth is because many of us can fly, but beetles are

not the fastest fliers in the insect world. In fact, some ground beetles do not

fly at all. Surely one big reason for our survival is the hard, outer wing cases

that set us apart from other insects. Being tough, we’re able to burrow down

under stones and logs into very narrow places where we remain hidden,

protected from predators. ~~_or animals that hunt and eat other animals_~~ It’s

hard to crush or bite a beetle.


Lesson 7 Armored Tanks of the Insect World
**105**


Challenge


How is a beetle’s survival
different from that of
other insects? _(Beetles_
_have been able to survive_
_because of their tough_
_bodies, whereas other_
_insects have been able to_
_survive largely because_
_they can fly.)_


**106**





**Show Image 7A-5: Bombardier beetle**

We clever beetles have many means

of protection. For instance, look at the

bombardier beetle. This ground-living beetle

produces chemicals in its abdomen. ~~_What_~~

~~_part of an insect is the abdomen?_~~ ~~(the section~~

~~at the end, farthest away from the head)~~

When attacked by a predator, the chemicals



combine to form a bad-smelling, boiling liquid. The bombardier beetle makes

a loud popping noise as it sprays its enemies with the chemicals, sometimes

burning other insects, or even people.


**Show Image 7A-6: Wasp beetle**

**Mimicry**, or animal look-alikes, is another

way beetles protect themselves. Look at this

beetle. What does it look like? It is called a

wasp beetle because its long yellow and black

body mimics, or copies, that of a wasp. How







do you think this keeps predators away from

the wasp beetle? Of course, they are afraid of

being stung.


**Show Image 7A-7: Namibian desert beetles**

Another reason for the large number of beetles

is the fact that beetles have been **adapting**,

or changing over time, for millions of years to

suit their environments. Beetles live in some of

the most difficult places to live on Earth, some

surviving in the intense heat of the desert and

others in underwater habitats where they have



to develop ways of breathing underwater.


Many desert beetles are wingless and live beneath the sand where it is cooler

and less dry. Some, like these Namibian [/n ə *mib*ee* ə n/] desert beetles,

have stilt-like legs, allowing them to rise above the hot sand. Still others have

developed arched elytra, creating tiny air pockets to help protect them from

the heat. ~~_What are elytra?_~~ ~~(thick, hard, protective front wing covers)~~


Unit 6 Insects: All Around


**Show Image 7A-8: Diving beetle and**
**whirligig beetle**

Because insects need air to live, water beetles

must come to the surface to get the oxygen

they need to breathe. Some water beetles, like

this diving beetle, ~~_[Point to the image on the_~~

~~_left.]_~~ have developed a trick of carrying oxygen

bubbles underwater, trapped just beneath



their elytra. This whirligig beetle ~~_[Point to the image on the right.]_~~ solves the

oxygen problem by staying mostly on the surface of ponds and streams,

using its paddle-shaped legs to spin and turn. Its eyes, divided into two parts,

can see above and below the surface of the water at the same time.


**Show Image 7A-9: Boll weevil**

Beetles have adapted over the years to eating

a variety of plant and animal foods. With

their strong, chewing mouthparts, nearly

every possible food source is used by some

kind of beetle. Weevils, like this boll weevil,





are thought to be some of the peskiest of all

beetles. Their long snouts enable them to bore



down into the seedpods of plants, called bolls. Boll weevils have destroyed

many fields of cotton, laying eggs in the holes they make. When the eggs

hatch, the larvae eat the plants from the inside out.


Some beetles feed on grains and seeds. Others chomp on apples, cherries,

and other fruits. Still others live on wood and decaying plant life. Carrion

beetles and their larvae feed on dead animals.


**Show Image 7A-10: Dung beetle rolling ball**
**of dung**

Dung beetles are named for the food that

they eat. Dung is manure, the solid waste of

animals. Dung is very rich in nutrients and an

ideal food for young dung beetles. Adult dung





beetles compete to get some of the dung.

They roll the dung into balls and push them



away from the other beetles. They bury the balls in the ground and lay eggs

in them. When the eggs hatch, the larvae feed on the dung.


Lesson 7 Armored Tanks of the Insect World
**107**


**Show Image 7A-11: Tiger beetle**

Tiger beetles are fierce predators, chasing

down almost any prey they can find, including

other insects. ~~Prey~~ ~~_refers to the animal that is_~~

~~_hunted and eaten. What does_~~ ~~predator~~ ~~_mean?_~~

Their fast legs and strong jaws make their job

easy. Tiger beetles are the fastest runners

in the insect world. Even the larvae of tiger



beetles are predators who eat other insects. The larvae hide in burrows,

popping partway out and snatching passing insects with their jaws.


**Show Image 7A-12: Stag beetle**

This stag beetle, with horns like the antlers of

a stag (or male deer), looks rather fierce, but

it is among the most harmless of all insects

and eats mostly tree sap and other liquids. Its

horns are actually its jaws. Male stag beetles







use these jaws to wrestle with each other for

females.


**Show Image 7A-13: Rhinoceros beetle**

Horned beetles, like this rhinoceros beetle,

include some of the largest beetles in the

world. Some of these beetles are also called

Hercules beetles due to their great strength.

~~_[You may wish to ask students what they_~~

~~_remember about Hercules’s strength from the_~~

~~Stories from Mount Olympus~~ ~~_unit.]_~~ The males

**108**



use their horns to drive other males away from a female when it is time to

produce young. Many of them live in hot, wet, tropical areas.


**Show Image 7A-14: Goliath beetle**

One of the largest and heaviest of all insects

is the male goliath beetle of Africa. Goliaths

can grow to be more than five inches long and

weigh about as much as two golf balls. Their

heavy bodies make them poor fliers, but they





are able to climb trees with ease, using their

strong legs and good claws.


Unit 6 Insects: All Around


Aren’t we beetles amazing? All insects—from those with eardrums on their

abdomens, to those that make their own honey, to those that glow in the

dark—are truly amazing. Many insects are so small you may forget they are

living all around you—in the trees, underground, even in your houses! It’s

true that some insects can become a real nuisance, but many insects, like

me, are extremely helpful. Next time, you will learn how important insects

are to your everyday lives.

###### Read-Aloud



**Reading:** Students will explain why humans and insects can be both helpful and
harmful to each other.


~~**TEKS 2.6.C; TEKS 2.7.D**~~


~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED? (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students to think all the way back to the first Read-Aloud you read.
Remind students that they heard that some insects can be pests and are
harmful to other living things and some insects are helpful to other living
things.


  - Reread the following key passages from the Read-Aloud “Insects Everywhere!”


**Show Image 1A-7: Grasshopper, leafhopper, aphids**


_Many insects, such as these tiny aphids, [/ae*f_ ə _dz/] can damage_
_entire meadows. Grasshoppers, leafhoppers, and aphids are all pests._
_Farmers are never happy when they discover them on their plants_
_because they can destroy their crops. But not all insects are pests._


**Show Image 1A-8: Ladybug, lacewing, ambush bug**


_Who knows what this insect is called? That’s right. It’s a ladybug. Did_
_you know that ladybugs are some of the most helpful insects on Earth?_
_They feed on aphids and the eggs of moths and beetles that destroy_
_crops. Lacewings and ambush bugs also eat aphids, so farmers are_
_happy when they see these insects on their plants._


**Show Image 1A-9: Pine trees and bark beetle**


_Pine trees are hosts to a variety of bark beetles. These tiny insects can_
_kill huge trees! How can that be possible? Bark beetles burrow, or dig,_
_under a tree’s bark, creating a series of tunnels in which they lay their_
_eggs. Well, let’s think about this . . . what does a tree need to live? By_
_burrowing into the layer of wood beneath the bark, these beetles stop_
_the flow of nutrients, or food, and water, throughout the tree and often_
_kill the tree._


**TEKS 2.6.C** Make and correct or confirm predictions using text features, characteristics of genre, and structure; **TEKS 2.7.D**
Retell and paraphrase texts in ways that maintain meaning and logical order.

**Turn and Talk:** Name one way insects are harmful to other plants
and animals, and name one way insects can be helpful to other
living things.


~~**MAKING PREDICTIONS (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that the title of today’s Read-Aloud is “Friend or Foe?”


 - Tell students that the word _foe_ means enemy or opponent.


 - Then ask what students think the title of the Read-Aloud means and what
they think will be the main topic of the Read-Aloud. Ask students who the
friends and who the foes might be.


 - Tell students that insects may be both friends and foes to humans, but that
humans also play a big role in the world of insects.


 - Tell students that today they will hear about one of the insect world’s biggest
foes, or enemies. Ask students who they think this might be. Tell students
humans are insects’ greatest foe.

~~**“FRIEND OR FOE?” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 8A-1: Entomologist**

Hi, boys and girls. Surprised to see me? I’ll bet

you were expecting another fabulous insect.

Disappointed to see a fellow human being? I

have been fascinated with insects since I was

in second grade, so I wanted to let you know





that if you are like me, you might be lucky

enough to keep learning about insects your



whole life. I am an **entomologist**, and studying insects is my job.


Some people call me the bug lady, but I study much more than bugs. When I

was your age, I called everything that creeps and crawls or buzzes and flies

a bug. Do you do that sometimes, too? Lots of people do, but did you know

that a bug and an insect are not the same thing? A bug is an insect, but not

all insects are bugs. Confusing, isn’t it?


**Show Image 8A-2: Shield bug sucking sap**
**from plant**

Scientists identify true bugs as insects with

beak-like mouths. These piercing, sucking

mouthparts allow the insect to pierce the

leaf or stem of a plant and suck out the plant



Support


Here the word _bug_ means
a small insect that has
a beak-like mouth with
sucking mouthparts. The
word _bug_ can also mean to
annoy someone. Refer to

for additional support on
the multiple meanings of
_bug_ .

**TEKS 2.9.D.i** Recognize characteristics and structures of informational text, including the central idea and supporting
evidence with adult assistance; **TEKS 2.3.D** Identify, use, and explain the meaning of antonyms, synonyms, idioms, and
homographs in context.


Lesson 8 Friend or Foe?
**117**


**Show Image 8A-3: Stinkbug, bedbug,**
**and cicada**

Let’s look at a few bugs. This is a stinkbug.

~~_[Point to the image on the left.]_~~ This is a

bedbug. ~~_[Point to the image on the right.]_~~

Treehoppers and aphids are bugs, too. Here’s

one you should recognize: a cicada. ~~_[Point to_~~

~~_the image in the center.]_~~ Look closely if you



see one of these bugs outside and you may see its long, piercing mouthparts.

~~_What did we learn about these bugs?_~~


**Show Image 8A-4: Close-up of ladybug**

This is another familiar insect. What is it

called? Right, a ladybug! It’s called a bug, but

is it? Does it have a beak-like mouth with a

long, piercing tube? No. Fascinating, isn’t

it—a ladybug isn’t a bug at all! In fact, its

harm? _(destructive)_


**118**





lesser-known name is the ladybeetle.


**Show Image 8A-5: Leafcutter ant, locusts, fly,**
**and moth (clockwise)**

I thought you should know about bugs, but

the real reason I’m here today is to talk to you

about helpful and harmful insects. I’ll start

with the bad news. You already know that

some plant-eating insects cause major crop

damage. Leafcutter ants can strip the leaves


|Col1|Col2|
|---|---|
||**8A-5**|



from an orange grove in one night. A swarm of locusts, or large grasshoppers,

can strip large areas of grassland in just a few hours. Fruit flies are orchard

pests as well. The larvae of many moths, flies, bugs, beetles, and weevils

are pests. The Colorado potato beetle is another example of an insect that

damages crops. ~~_[Show Image Cards 16 (potatoes) and 17 (potato beetles).]_~~

~~_Adults and larvae eat the leaves of the potato plant. Damaged plants can’t_~~

~~_produce as many potatoes._~~


Unit 6 Insects: All Around


**Show Image 8A-6: Spraying crops with**
**pesticides, honeybee, and bird**

So, what’s the solution? Humans thought they

had a great idea. They created **pesticides**,

poisons that could kill all of the insect pests

on the whole field so the crops could grow

without being eaten.


But there was a problem with that. Do you



think the pests were the only animals living in the field? ~~_[Pause for students_~~

~~_to share.]_~~


It turns out that pesticides can be just as big of a problem as the pests

themselves. Pesticides can destroy both harmful _and_ helpful insects. Frogs

and birds may eat the poisoned insects and become sick, too. They may

even die. Pesticides have killed **pollinators** like the honeybee. ~~_Pollinators_~~

~~_are insects that carry pollen from one plant to another to enable plants to_~~

~~_grow and produce flowers or fruit._~~ Without pollinators, plants cannot make

seeds to grow new plants or produce fruits. With fewer plants, fewer insects

are able to survive. So, you see, the human use of pesticides changes the

environment for everybody—and not always in a good way. Because of this,

you can see how a person can be a **foe**, or enemy, of insects.


**Show Image 8A-7: Natural insect predators:**
**lacewing and ladybug**

One alternative that is being used by many

farmers today, is to keep plant pests under

control by introducing their natural enemies,

one insect against the other. Ladybugs and





lacewings are predators that catch and eat

aphids. Wasps and ants eat insects harmful

to crops as well.



Lesson 8 Friend or Foe?
**119**


**Show Image 8A-8: Fly, cockroach, flea, and**
**mosquito (clockwise)**

I do have a little bit more bad news for you

before I get to the good news. Some insects

can be dirty. They can spread germs. When

flies, ants, and cockroaches walk across our

kitchen countertops with the same feet they

use to crawl through dirt and rotting plants,



they can poison our food and make us sick.


Some insects, such as mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs, and lice, live off host

animals. ~~_You heard about host plants. What is a host animal?_~~ These types

of insects can be very harmful to people. The Anopheles [/ ə *nof* ə *leez/]

mosquito carries malaria, a deadly disease. Hundreds of years ago, fleas

that carried deadly bacteria spread the plague, a disease that killed millions

of people—or almost one-third of Europe. Today, fleas are more irritating

than deadly.


**Show Image 8A-9: Honeybee and dung beetle**

That’s enough bad news. Are you ready for

some good news? There’s lots of it! You

already know how important honeybees and

other plant pollinators are to the survival of

the planet. Without pollinators, there would





be no beautiful flowers or sweet fruit, because

the crops would not be pollinated, and crops



need to be pollinated in order to grow.


Scavenger insects, like the dung beetle, are important, too. By feeding on

dead plants and animals and their waste products, scavengers break up dead

material and return rich nutrients to the soil.


**Show Image 8A-10: Honey, honeybee, candle;**
**silk thread, silkworm and cocoons, woman**
**weaving silk cloth**

Insects are also responsible for many products

that humans use. What product does the

honeybee give us? Yes, honey! They also give





us beeswax, used to make wood polishes and

candles, and even lipsticks! And did you know


Unit 6 Insects: All Around


|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|
|---|---|---|---|
|||**8A-10**||



**120**


that the spider is not the only creature that spins silk? Many other insects

produce silk as well. The silk moth lays its eggs on the leaves of mulberry

trees. Their larvae, silk caterpillars, spin cocoons out of a single strand

of silk. The silk from their cocoons is gathered and unwound to produce

beautiful silk thread used to make cloth.


**Show Image 8A-11: Bowl of crickets, roasted**
**grasshoppers, roasted termites/ants**

You know that insects are a food source for

other insects and animals, but did you know

that many people eat insects as well? Lightly

salted crickets are eaten as snacks in many





parts of Asia. Roasted grasshoppers with

chili and lime are popular in Mexico. Roasted



termites are a part of the regular diet of many Africans. Some Australians

feast on beetle larvae, and some Europeans enjoy the sweet crunch of

chocolate-covered ants.


**Show Image 8A-12: Collage of insects**

You know that insects make up the largest

group of animals on Earth. Their ability to

adapt over time to nearly every environment

has made them terrifically successful

survivors on the planet. ~~_What does the word_~~





~~adapt~~ ~~_mean?_~~ Whereas we think that humans

have been around for about forty thousand


|Col1|Col2|
|---|---|
||**8A-12**|



years, some scientists believe that insects have lived on Earth for about

four- hundred million years! They are the most varied of all animals, coming

in all shapes, colors, and sizes. Scientists guess that there are over one

million species, but it’s hard to know for sure because it is impossible to

count them all as they crawl, fly, swim, and hide all around the world.


**Show Image 8A-13: Rainforest clearance and**
**desert homes**

Even with all of these millions and billions

and trillions of insects, some are in danger of

**extinction**, or disappearing from the earth.

How can that be? It happens when many





insects are killed at the same time. We humans



Lesson 8 Friend or Foe?
**121**


are insects’ worst enemies because we often destroy their native habitats.

~~_What is the word you heard a few minutes ago that means an enemy?_~~ For

example, huge areas of the rainforests have been cleared. ~~_[Point to the image_~~

~~_on the left.]_~~ When trees are cut down for wood, all of the plants are removed

and the insects that lived on the plants are destroyed. Insects and other

animals that feed on those insects are affected when they can no longer find

enough food. Also, people build homes in the desert ~~_[Point to the image on_~~

~~_the right.]_~~ and not only destroy animal habitats, but also very quickly use up

all the water that the desert insects need to survive.


**Show Image 8A-14: Grassland and wetland**

Grasslands are often cleared for planting

crops. When the grassland host plants

disappear, their visiting insects cannot survive.

Water is often drained from wetlands to build

farms, homes, and roads. When this happens,







fertilizers from the farmers’ fields often run

into the wetlands and encourage plants there

to grow out of control. They soak up all the

water and the wetland dries up.


**Show Image 8A-15: Honeybee**

So, why do you think it matters whether

insects become extinct? Isn’t it good to kill

those often pesky, sometimes deadly, critters?

I don’t think so. Think about the honeybee. It

may sting you, but a moment’s pain is nothing

compared to all the benefits it provides by

helping to pollinate plants and produce fruits



**122**



or other foods that you need to survive. We still have a lot to learn about the

insect world, but we do know that everything in our world is connected, and

that plants and animals depend upon one another for survival. We do not

want to upset the balance of nature.


Unit 6 Insects: All Around


**Show Image 8A-16: Looking at trees and**
**looking at flowers**

Now that you know how important insects are

to our world, I hope that you will think twice

before squashing a bug beneath your feet. I

encourage you to use your own schoolyard

to look for insects and spiders. Where might

you look? Lots of places—under a rock, in the



grass, on bushes and trees, on flowers, and in the soil. Remember, many

insects are very good at camouflage, so don’t give up. They may be hiding in

plain sight.

**125**


- To review prepositions and prepositional phrases, explain to students that
a preposition is a word that can help tell where something is taking place.
Words like _in, out, under, above,_ etc. are called _prepositions_ . Prepositions are
useful in making simple sentences longer and more interesting.


- Remind students that a prepositional phrase is a phrase that begins with
a preposition and is followed by an object (e.g., _in the cave, on the table,_
_under the rock, above the clouds_ ). A prepositional phrase answers the
same question, _where,_ that a preposition answers about something in a
sentence.

Unit 6 Insects: All Around


**Grade 2 | Unit 6**
###### Unit Assessment


This unit assessment evaluates each student’s retention of unit and
academic vocabulary words and the core content targeted in _Insects._ The
results should guide review and remediation the following day.


There are two parts to this assessment. You may choose to do the parts
in more than one sitting if you feel this is more appropriate for your
students. Part I (vocabulary assessment) is divided into two sections: the
first assesses unit-related vocabulary, and the second assesses academic
vocabulary. Part II of the assessment addresses the core content targeted in
_Insects._


~~**PART I**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.7.F**~~


  - Read the following directions aloud:


    - I am going to ask you a _yes_ or _no_ question using a word you have heard
in the Read-Alouds. First I will say the word, and then I will ask the _yes_ or
_no_ question. If the answer is “yes,” circle the thumbs-up. If the answer is
“no,” circle the thumbs-down. I will say each question two times. Let’s do
number one together.


  - Read the word, and then read the sentence. Pause for students to record
their answers.

bioluminescence? _(thumbs-up)_


10. **Entomologist:** Is an entomologist a type of bug? _(thumbs-down)_


 - Read the following directions to aloud:


   - Now I am going to read more questions using other words you have heard
and practiced. If the answer is “yes,” circle the thumbs-up. If the answer is
“no,” circle the thumbs-down. I will say each question two times.


11. **Microscopic:** If something is microscopic is it very, very large?
_(thumbs-down)_


12. **Cooperate:** If people cooperate, do they work together to accomplish
something? _(thumbs-up)_


13. **Destructive:** If something is destructive, does that mean it is helpful and
tries to make things better? _(thumbs-down)_

    - I am going to ask you a _yes_ or _no_ question about information from the
Read-Alouds. If the answer is “yes,” circle the thumbs-up. If the answer is
“no,” circle the thumbs-down. I will say each question two times. Let’s do
number one together.


  - Read the sentence and pause as students record their answers. You may
want to read the questions twice.


1. Do insects live in every habitat on Earth, except in the ocean? _(thumbs-up)_


2. Do insects have eight legs and five main body parts? _(thumbs-down)_


3. Do insects have skeletons on the inside of their bodies like we do?
