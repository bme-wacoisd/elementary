Dear Family Member,


#### 1.2 Take-Home



During the next several days, your student will begin learning about some of the
pivotal years in U.S. immigration history, the mid-1800s to the early 1900s. They will
learn about a few of the groups that immigrated to America during that time, some of
the reasons why people immigrate to other countries, and why people immigrate to the
United States in particular. They will also learn about the national motto, _e pluribus unum_
(out of many, one), why many immigrants chose to settle in cities, and what life was like
for those immigrants.


Below are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to reinforce what
your student is learning about U.S. immigration in the late nineteenth century.


1. Statue of Liberty


Talk with your student about this famous statue. Discuss the history of the Statue of
Liberty and any personal experiences you have with it. You may also wish to have your
student draw and/or write about the Statue of Liberty. Ask questions to encourage
your student to use the vocabulary learned at school as they draw or write.


2. Song: “This Land Is Your Land”


Listen to the song “This Land Is Your Land” with your student. Discuss what this song
means and how it can relate to immigration.


3. Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read with your student every day. Set aside time to read to
your student and listen to your student read to you.

Dear Family Member,


#### 9.2 Take-Home



Today your student learned how an immigrant can become a naturalized citizen. This
Read-Aloud is the first of three Read-Alouds that discuss citizenship in the United States
and what it means to be a citizen. They will learn some basic facts about the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights, some basic functions of the government, and about the “Father of
the Constitution,” James Madison. They will also learn about the rights the Constitution
gives U.S. citizens and the responsibilities that come with those rights. Below are some
suggestions for activities that you may do at home to reinforce what your student is
learning about U.S. citizenship.


1. The Constitution and the Bill of Rights


Have your student share with you what they have learned about the Constitution, the
highest law of the United States, and the Bill of Rights. Have your student tell you why
these documents are so important to the United States. You may wish to discuss with your
student what the United States might be like if these documents did not exist.


2. James Madison


Talk with your student about this important historical figure. Ask your student what
role Madison had in creating the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Have your student
share what other roles James Madison played in the U.S. government.


3. Song: “The Star-Spangled Banner”


Listen to the song “The Star-Spangled Banner” with your student. Discuss why this
song is the national anthem of the United States. Together, share what you both know
about the meaning and history of this song. You may also want to share with your student
any memorable experiences you have had singing or listening to “The Star-Spangled
Banner.”

4. Words to Use


Below is a list of some of the words that your student will be learning about and using.
Try to use these words as they come up in everyday speech with your student.

     - _responsibilities_ —Responsibilities are things a person is in charge of doing and
depended on to carry out.

     - _amendments_ —Americans have added amendments, or additions, to the
Con sti tution.

     - _consent_ —In return for the power to change the government, the people agree to
live according to the laws. This is called “the consent of the governed.”


5. Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read with your student every day. Set aside time to read to
your student and listen to your student read to you.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing what they have learned
at school.
