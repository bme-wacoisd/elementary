**Flip Book Introduction**


This Flip Book contains images that accompany the Teacher
Guide for _Stories of the Ancient Greeks_ . The images are in
sequential order. Each image is identified by its lesson number,
read-aloud letter (A or B), and the number of the image within
the particular read-aloud. For example, the first image in ReadAloud 1A is numbered 1A-1. Once you have worked your way
through the book to the last page, you will flip the entire book
over to view the second half of the images.


Depending on your classroom configuration, you may need
to have students sit closer to the flip book in order to see the
images clearly.
