**Lesson 1: Model Persuasive Speech**

#### **Model Persuasive Speech** When trading, the most important thing is to be fair! Both sides should decide what is fair before the trade. The United States traded flour and tobacco with England and France, in exchange for goods they produced. It’s easy to make a fair trade when both sides talk about what they want. It’s also important for both sides to try to be fair to each other. Trading should be fair!
