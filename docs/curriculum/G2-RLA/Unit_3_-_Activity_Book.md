Dear Family Member,


### 1.2 Take-Home



Today, your student heard a read-aloud about the twelve mythical Greek gods and
goddesses that the ancient Greeks believed lived on Mount Olympus. Over the next
several days, your student will review that the ancient Greeks believed in many mythical
gods and goddesses, and that the twelve on Mount Olympus were thought to be the
most powerful. S/he will learn the definition of a myth (a fictional story, once thought
to be true), and that myths try to explain occurrences in nature, teach moral stories,
and entertain listeners. Your student will hear several well-known Greek myths including
“Prometheus and Pandora,” “Demeter and Persephone,” and “Arachne the Weaver.”


Below are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to reinforce what
your student is learning about Greek myths.


1. Mount Olympus


Have your student share which twelve mythical gods and goddesses the ancient
Greeks thought lived on Mount Olympus and what these mythical gods and goddesses
were in charge of. ( _Zeus_, _Poseidon_, _Demeter_, _Hera_, _Hephaestus_, _Aphrodite_, _Athena_, _Ares_,
_Apollo_, _Artemis_, _Hermes_, _Dionysus_ ) As your student shares what they know about these
twelve mythical Greek gods and goddesses, share with them what you know, including any
mythical Greek gods and goddesses that they have not heard about.


2. Sayings and Phrases: Cold Feet


Your student will learn the saying “cold feet” in relation to the Greek myth of Daedalus
and Icarus. Before Daedalus and his son Icarus use their wax wings to try to escape from
the prison tower, Daedalus hesitates with sudden fear. Talk with your student about other
situations where one might use the saying “cold feet.”


3. Words to Use


Below is a list of some of the words that your student will be learning about and using.
Try to use these words as they come up in everyday speech with your student.

     - _myths_ —Many ancient peoples told myths, fictional stories thought to be true at
the time. Myths were used to explain events in nature or teach a lesson.

_• fork in the road_ —A “fork in the road” is a place where the road splits in two. It
can also mean when you have to make a decision, but you aren’t sure what to
choose.

Dear Family Member,


### 7.3 Take-Home



Today, your student heard a read-aloud about the most famous hero in Greek
mythology, Hercules. Over the next several days your student will hear more about the

to search at the library or online for text or more details about Hercules’ other labors to
share with your student.

Ask your student to tell you about Atalanta, the swift-footed huntress. Discuss with
your student how the mythical goddess Aphrodite helped one of Atalanta’s suitors trick
her, sharing that the mythical Greek gods and goddesses were believed to have often
interfered in the lives of humans. Share with your student other myths you may know of
where the mythical Greek gods or goddesses interfered in the lives of others.
