#### Introduction


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching _The U.S._
_Civil War_ unit. The Teacher Guide for _The U.S. Civil War_ contains twelve daily lessons, each of which is
composed of three distinct parts, so that the lesson may be divided into smaller chunks of time and
presented at different intervals during the day. The entire lesson will require a total of 60 minutes.


This unit includes a two-day Pausing Point following Lesson 5. At the end of the unit, a Unit Review, a
Unit Assessment, and Culminating Activities are included to allow time to review, reinforce, assess,
and remediate content knowledge. You should spend no more than 17 days total on this unit.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


At the back of this Teacher Guide, you will find a section titled “Teacher Resources.” In this section
you will find the following:


  - Activity Book Answer Key


  - Measures of Text Complexity


  - Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Correlation Chart


  - English Language Proficiency Standards Correlation Chart


~~**UNIT COMPONENTS**~~


Along with this Teacher Guide, you will need the following:


  - Flip Book for _The U.S. Civil War_


  - Image Cards for _The U.S. Civil War_


  - Activity Book for _The U.S. Civil War_


  - Digital Components for _The U.S. Civil War_


All unit component materials can also be found in the program’s online materials.


~~**ADDITIONAL RESOURCES**~~


You might also consider creating a classroom lending library, allowing students to borrow
Civil War-related books to read at home with their families.


Introduction
**1**


~~**WHY THE U.S. CIVIL WAR IS IMPORTANT**~~


This unit will introduce students to an important period in the history of the United States. In an
age-appropriate way, students will learn about the controversy over slavery between the North and
the South, which was the primary issue leading to the U.S. Civil War. Within the first lesson, students
will learn that slavery is wrong and why it is wrong. They will learn about the path of freedom set
forth at the founding of the country, the influence of religious faith on those beliefs in freedom, and
how this commitment to freedom ultimately led to the civil war and the end of slavery.


Students will learn about some women and men who were significant during this time, including
Harriet Beecher Stowe, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Abraham Lincoln, Julia Ward Howe,
Robert E. Lee, Clara Barton, and Ulysses S. Grant. Students will also learn about their motivations,
including why the abolitionists and so many others were committed to ending the practice of slavery
in the United States and around the world.


This unit will lay the foundation for in-depth studies of the U.S. Civil War in later grades. It will also
set the stage for the Grade 2 _Fighting for a Cause_ unit, which will be taught later in the school year.


This unit also provides opportunities for students to build content knowledge and draw connections
to the social studies subject area, but it does not explicitly teach the Texas Essential Knowledge
and Skills standards for Social Studies. At times throughout the unit, you may wish to build on
class discussions to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of
Citizenship, Geography, History, and Social Studies Skills from the social studies discipline. For
more information on religious source material in reading/language arts, consult the program guide.
For information about the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity
of the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED**~~


The following units, and the specific core content that was targeted in those units, are particularly
relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _The U.S. Civil War_ . This background knowledge will
greatly enhance students’ understanding of the Read-Alouds with which they are about to engage. If
your students did not follow the program in Kindergarten and Grade 1, it is recommended that you
review the introductory overviews from the following units to fill any gaps in students’ background
knowledge.


**• America Our Great Country (Kindergarten, Unit 10)**


**• American Independence (Grade 1, Unit 8)**


Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**2**


~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR THE U.S. CIVIL WAR**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _The U.S. Civil War_ in the forms in which
they appear in the Read-Alouds or, in some instances, in the “Introducing the Read-Aloud” section at
the beginning of the lesson. Boldfaced words in the list have an associated Word Work activity. The
inclusion of the words on this list does not mean that students are immediately expected to be able
to use all of these words on their own. However, through repeated exposure throughout the lessons,
they should acquire a good understanding of most of these words and begin to use some of them in
conversation.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Introducing the Read-Aloud**


                 - Prepare to display and reference the Global Map during the reading or use
an alternate global map for support.

**Application**


                  - Prepare to display Activity Page 1.1. Alternatively, you may access a digital
version in the activity pages for this unit.


**Note to Teacher**


                  - This unit necessarily includes the topic of slavery. Be sure to explain that
slavery is a terrible thing that has been used by different groups of people
throughout history, going back thousands of years. Unfortunately, slavery
also existed in the past in our country, and life was very hard for enslaved
people in America. Many people in the time before the American Civil War
came to believe that slavery was morally wrong, but slavery was still allowed.
Emphasize that slavery was wrong then, and it is wrong today.


**Universal Access**

**Introducing the Read-Aloud**


                 - Assign student pairs for the Check for Understanding activity. After reading
each decision, give students a moment to turn to a partner and discuss why
they think it is good or bad. This allows students to articulate their reasoning
and learn from each other’s perspectives.


**Read-Aloud**


                 - Invite students to work in small groups during the Comprehension

Discussion. During the discussion, encourage students to engage in a

Turn and Talk to discuss the answers to the questions based on their

understanding of the Read-Aloud.


**Application**


                 - As students complete Activity Page 1.2, provide sentence starters like the

ones below to support their thinking and writing development on the topic

of slavery, why it is wrong, and where it was practiced.


                         - Slavery is _____.


                         - Slavery is wrong because _____.

about it will help us to make better decisions.


  - Explain the difference between a good decision and a bad decision.


Check for Understanding


**Stand Up/Sit Down.** I am going to read you four decisions. After I read
each decision, turn to your partner and discuss why you think it is good or
bad. Then, on my signal, if the decision that I read to you describes a good
decision, stand up. If the decision that I read describes a bad decision, sit
down.

Support


It may be difficult for
students to understand

how a person could be

bought and sold. Be
prepared to explain that a
long time ago, slaves were

treated like they were
things instead of people.
Highlight that it is not fair

or right for people to be
treated that way. Convey

that society has learned

from these mistakes
and has made changes
to ensure that everyone
has the freedom to make

their own choices and be

treated fairly and with

kindness.



~~**“THE PROBLEM OF SLAVERY” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 1A-1: Making Choices**



~~_What do you see in this picture?_~~ Every day of
your life, you make choices. Some are good and
some are bad. You can do the right thing and
choose to finish your homework. Or, you can
choose to do the wrong thing and copy another

thing is never okay. However, it gives you the
opportunity ~~_or chance_~~ to learn from your mistakes. When you face the same
choice in the future, you will have learned an important lesson and will not
repeat the bad behavior. ~~_What are some examples of good and bad choices?_~~





**Show Image 1A-2: Studying History**



One of the reasons we study history is to learn
from the past choices of other people. This
helps to inform ~~_or make_~~ our own decisions.
Some of the past choices that people made
were right. Some of the past choices people

walked the Earth, right and wrong, and good
and evil, have co-existed ~~_or happened at the same time_~~ in every village, town,
and nation. So, when you learn about history, you need the full story. You
must study the good and the bad. That way, you will have the tools you need
to make better decisions today. ~~_Why is it important to learn about the good_~~
~~_and bad things that people did in the past?_~~





Now, we are going to talk about an evil that has been with the human race for
thousands of years: **slavery** . ~~Slavery~~ ~~_is the practice of holding people against_~~
~~_their will, forcing them to work without pay, and denying them the freedom to_~~
~~_decide how to live their lives._~~


**Show Image 1A-3: Bought and Sold**





What does it mean to be a slave? ~~_A slave is_~~
~~_a person who is not free to make choices._~~
If someone is **enslaved**, it means that they
do not have the freedom to make their own
choices. They are controlled by someone
else. An enslaved person was often wrongly



Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**12**


considered to be someone else’s property and could be bought and sold for
a specific **value,** ~~_or price that the person was determined to be worth. The_~~
~~_word_~~ ~~value~~ ~~_tells us how useful or important something is._~~ Slaves throughout
history have often been treated badly by their **masters,** ~~_the people who_~~
~~_controlled or owned slaves._~~ Many had to work difficult jobs and were
separated from their families. No matter how they were treated, they did not
have freedom to leave their situation.


**Show Image 1A-4: Ancient Greece**



For most of human history, slavery was very
common. More than 4,000 years ago, in
ancient Egypt, slavery was widespread and
common. We have studied the ancient Greek
civilization, from more than 2,000 years ago.

Ancient Greece is thought to be the birthplace
of **democracy.** Democracy is a form of government where people are free to
vote for their leaders and free to decide what kind of laws they want to have.
~~_Why is_~~ ~~democracy~~ ~~_important?_~~ But even in a place that we think of as the
birthplace of democracy and freedom, there were slaves.



Challenge


Have students think
about why there were
slaves in a place that had
democracy and freedom.
Invite them to give an
example of a situation
where something good
and something bad
happened at the same
time.





**Show Image 1A-5: Slaves in Ancient Greece**



Slavery was very common in ancient Greece.
In Athens, for example, slaves were imported,
or brought in, from other nearby territories.
They were captured during war, taken by
pirates, or bought from traders. ~~[Point to the~~

~~_this picture?_~~ Slaves were seen as a master’s
property. The slaves could be bought and sold. Slaves could be treated with
respect or could be treated harshly. They had a variety of jobs, ranging from
working as housekeepers to doing brutal work digging for valuable metals in
mines deep in the ground. Some historians think that well over one-third of
the population of ancient Greece was enslaved.







**Show Image 1A-6: Mali Empire**


Slavery existed long before ancient Greece,
and continued long after. As time went
on, the **institution** of slavery continued in
many different nations. ~~_An_~~ ~~institution~~ ~~_is an_~~

of the nation we call the Mali Empire, which existed about 700 years ago. The
Mali Empire was located in West Africa. Even today, there is a country in West
Africa called Mali. ~~[Point out Mali on the Global Map.]~~ Back in the 1300s, the
Mali Empire was very wealthy. Much of the world’s gold was found in mines
throughout West Africa controlled by the Mali Empire. Back then, 700 years
ago, people did not have refrigerators, so salt was very important to preserve
food. Mali became a major source of salt for much of the Western world. The
Mali Empire had large numbers of slaves working in these mines.


**Show Image 1A-7: Caravan from Mecca**


Mansa Musa ruled Mali when the empire was
at its height of power, 700 years ago. Mansa, or
king, Musa is thought by some to be the richest
person who ever lived. He had large amounts
of gold and salt. But he also had many slaves.

is known as the home of the Islamic religion located in modern-day Saudi
Arabia. ~~[Point from Mali to Saudi Arabia on the Global Map.]~~ ~~_It is almost_~~
~~_3,000 miles from Mali to Saudi Arabia. That is a very long distance. That’s like_~~
~~_traveling across the whole state of Texas from east to west three times._~~ When
Musa took his religious journey to Mecca, he brought 12,000 slaves with him.





Slavery existed on the other side of the world, too. Before the Europeans
arrived in North America, Native Americans enslaved one another. The
journals of traders, explorers, and missionaries who later ventured across
North America described finding many Native American enslaved persons.


Many of the European nations that were establishing **colonies** in North
and South America also practiced slavery. ~~_When people leave their country_~~
~~_and build a home in a new place, but they are still controlled by the country_~~
~~_they came from, it is called a_~~ ~~colony~~ ~~_._~~ The Spanish Empire explored much of
Central and South America and set up many colonies. The Spanish colonies
in the islands of the Caribbean had large numbers of slaves. The Portuguese
Empire created a colony in what is modern-day Brazil, and that colony
included thousands of slaves. Many British colonies also had slaves. ~~[Point~~
~~out these areas on the Global Map.]~~

**Before His Cabinet**


Slavery has taken many forms and existed for
thousands of years. It has impacted people of
many different races and religions. Though it
may look different now, slavery tragically still
exists in many parts of the world today.



By the 1700s, as the 13 British colonies of North America started the first steps
to becoming an independent nation, the practice of slavery had unfortunately
become all too common in the colonies and could be very harsh. However, many
people were becoming aware that it was wrong. Many of America’s Founding
Fathers recognized how evil slavery was. Still, it would take nearly 90 years after
America became a nation and a grueling civil war for slavery to be outlawed, ~~_or_~~
~~_not allowed,_~~ with the passing of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
We will learn about the heroes who stood up for freedom and who secured the
rights and liberties of every man, woman, and child.


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


If students have difficulty responding to questions, reread pertinent
passages of the Read-Aloud and/or refer to specific images. If students
give one-word answers and/or fail to use Read-Aloud or unit vocabulary in
their responses, acknowledge correct responses by expanding students’
responses using richer and more complex language. Ask students to answer in
complete sentences by having them restate the question in their responses.


1. **Literal.** What does _slave_ mean?


» If someone is a slave, it means that they do not have the freedom
to make their own choices; they are held against their will, forced
to work for no pay, and controlled by someone else.


2. **Literal.** What are some places where slavery existed? (Mapping Activity:
Students use the text to map places throughout history where slavery has
occurred.)


» Slavery existed in ancient Egypt; it existed in ancient Greece; it existed
in Mali; it existed in Central and South America; it existed in America.


Lesson 1 The Problem of Slavery
**15**


3. **Inferential.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ An inference is an educated guess we can
make based on what we read in the text. What inference can you make about
what life was like for enslaved people?


» Life for enslaved people was hard. They had to work hard; they had to
do things that they didn’t want to do; they weren’t paid for their hard
work; and many had minimal shelter, clothing, and food.

**Stand Up/Sit Down.** I am going to read you six statements. If the
statement I read to you correctly describes something connected with
slavery around the world, stand up. If the statement I read does not
describe something connected with slavery around the world, sit down.


                         - Slaves were treated as property and could be bought and sold.
(stand up)


                         - Slavery was only in North and South America. (sit down)


                         - Mansa Musa, a ruler in West Africa, had many slaves during his religious

                         - Slavery is still present in some parts of the world today. (stand up)


~~**WORD WORK: VALUE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “An enslaved person was often wrongly
considered to be someone else’s property and could be bought and sold for a
specific _value_, or price that the person was determined to be worth.”


2. Say the word _value_ with me.


3. The _value_ of something tells how useful or important it is.


4. An air conditioner keeps you nice and cool on hot days, making it of great
value during the summer months.


5. What has value to you and why? Try to use the word value when you talk
about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase
students’ responses: “_____ has great value to me because _____.”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**16**


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I am going to read a phrase
about something that either has value or does not have value. If the phrase
describes something that has value, then say, “That has value.” If the phrase
does not describe something that has value, say, “That does not have value.”
(Answers may vary, as students may have different opinions about some of
these.)


  - A one-of-a-kind painting by a famous artist (That has value.)


  - A broken pencil (That does not have value.)


  - A guide dog for a person who is blind (That has value.)


  - A book with many pages missing (That does not have value.)


  - A calculator for a very difficult math problem (That has value.)


  - Food for someone who has not eaten all day (That has value.)


  - An umbrella that is full of holes (That does not have value.)


  - A flat tire on a bike (That does not have value.)


  - A coat on a cold day (That has value.)


**NOTE:** As answers may vary, remind students that the value of something
can be different for everyone. What is of value to me may not be of value to
someone else.

**Recall:** Ask students the following questions to help them remember
details from the Read-Aloud:


       - What is slavery?


» Slavery is the practice of holding people against their will, forcing
them to work without pay, and denying them the freedom to decide
how to live their lives.


       - Why is slavery wrong?


» Slavery is wrong because it takes away freedoms; people couldn’t
make their own decisions; people worked for no pay.


       - What are some places around the world where there was slavery?


» Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, Mali, Central and South America,
and more.


       - Tell students you are going to write down what they say.


       - Record this information on Activity Page 1.1. Once the information has
been recorded, read it to the class.

 - Give each student Activity Page 1.2.


 - Tell students that they are going to use the activity page to write three
sentences. The first sentence should tell what slavery is. The second
sentence should tell why slavery is wrong. The last sentence should name
one place in the world besides the United States where slavery happened.


 - Have students think about what they learned about slavery from the ReadAloud. Then, ask the question, _What is slavery?_


 - Have students write one sentence to answer the question. Give students
time to write.


 - When students are done writing, ask the question, _Why is slavery wrong?_
Before they begin writing, have them think about why slavery is wrong using
what they learned from the Read-Aloud. Then, invite students to write one
sentence to answer the question. Give students time to write.


 - When students are done writing the second sentence, remind them that the
last sentence should name one place in the world where slavery happened
other than the United States. Tell students to think about the places around
the world that we wrote down in the previous activity. Have students write
one sentence to answer the question. Give students time to write.

were brought on ships from Africa to North

of their reasons, the colonists had to **compromise** ~~_or find a way to work_~~

We’ve read about some of the people who came to America motivated by religious
freedom. The Pilgrims helped establish colonies in the North, like Massachusetts.

~~[Display the U.S. Map, and point to Massachusetts on the map.]~~ They came to
America with strong religious beliefs that required them to separate from the
Church of England and its practices. Other groups, like the Puritans, also came to
the New World to live in ways consistent with their interpretations of the Christian
Bible, not as they were required to do in Europe.

Support


Encourage students to
reflect on the Puritans’
move to a new world.
Prompt them to consider
what it would take for them
to leave their homes and
move to a completely new
environment.



For example, one of the first governors of the
colony of Massachusetts was a man named
John Winthrop. He was a Puritan, and deeply
motivated by his religious beliefs. In 1630, he
gave a sermon, ~~_or a speech that a pastor or_~~

~~_and guidance,_~~ where he described his vision for
the new American colony: “For we must consider that we shall be as a city
upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us.” Winthrop was quoting from
a sermon delivered by Jesus of Nazareth as recorded in the Christian Bible.
Winthrop was telling the settlers that they must live in the way God called
them to live, as an example to the rest of the world. ~~_How do you think John_~~
~~_Winthrop wanted the colonists to live? How do you know?_~~

Slavery was still a common practice
throughout the world during this time, and
these early Puritan settlers were accustomed
to slavery like most other people. But
their religious faith and ideas about liberty

In Massachusetts as early as 1646, courts
ruled in certain cases that slavery was unlawful, even that it was a sin, or
something harmful based on their religious beliefs. While slavery was still
practiced in many places, the religious beliefs of some of these early settlers
in the American colonies planted seeds that had an impact over time. ~~_What_~~
~~_happens to a seed when you plant it? When it is said that the Puritans planted_~~
~~_seeds, it means they shared their beliefs and over time those beliefs started_~~
~~_to grow and spread to other people—just like when you plant a tiny seed in the_~~
~~_ground and it grows into a big, strong plant._~~





By the early 1700s, people from different religions were living in all
13 colonies. Many people strongly practiced their faith. But religious
interpretations of the issue of slavery were different for different Christians.
And for some colonists, religious beliefs were not as strong.


Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**28**


**Show Image 2A-5: The Great Awakening**



Then, in the late 1720s, a religious movement
began. It was called the **First Great**
**Awakening**, and it swept across all of the
colonies. Colonists who participated in the
First Great Awakening wanted people to

with their interpretations of teachings of the
Christian Bible. Many historians think of this





**Show Image 2A-6: Great Awakening**
**Preachers**



The Great Awakening preachers emphasized
their religious beliefs. This included the belief
that all people are made in the image of God
so that every person deserves dignity and

born with equal rights, given by God, to the
basic freedom of deciding how to work and live.
And it included the idea that if people were equal in the eyes of God then the
laws of the nation should treat them equally. Based on these ideas, many
people began to realize that slavery should not continue. The First Great
Awakening influenced many of those who ended up leading America’s war for
independence from Great Britain. ~~_What does it mean to be treated equally?_~~
~~_How do you think slaves felt about what these preachers believed?_~~





**Show Image 2A-7: George Washington**
**and the Founding Fathers**



Many of the Founding Fathers came to believe
that slavery was a moral evil that must end.
~~_The Founding Fathers were a group of men led_~~
~~_by George Washington. Together, they helped_~~

~~_establish the government of the United States._~~
During his life, George Washington owned slaves. But like many during that
time, he grew to see the practice as morally wrong, and made plans in his
will to free them after his wife’s death. George Washington wrote in a letter





Lesson 2 The Great Awakenings and the Founders
**29**


Challenge


Why do you think the
Founding Fathers, who
believed slavery was
wrong, had a hard time
finding a solution to end it?


Support


Explain that the
Constitution is like a very
important rulebook for our
country, the United States.
The Founding Fathers
wrote it to tell us how
our government should
work and what rights and
freedoms we all have.



that he wished to see a plan to **abolish**, or get rid of, slavery. Washington
wrote, “[T]here is not a man living who wishes more sincerely than I do, to
see a plan adopted for the abolition ~~_or the ending or stopping_~~ of [slavery].”
Another Founding Father, Benjamin Franklin, became president of the

Abolition Society in Pennsylvania, proposing laws to abolish slavery. ~~[Point~~
~~to Pennsylvania on the U.S. Map. Preview that Pennsylvania is a Northern~~
~~state that fought on the side of the Union because they supported the end of~~
~~slavery during the Civil War.]~~


While attitudes about slavery were changing for many, they did not change for
everyone. The Founding Fathers struggled with finding solutions because slavery
greatly affected life in both the South and North. Southern plantations depended
on enslaved labor to produce foods like rice, as well as cotton, tobacco, and other
products needed by the North. Without enslaved labor, those businesses could fail.
They were also concerned that this issue would divide the colonies. If the colonies
could not come together in compromise, there could be no independent, free
America. And for those committed to ending slavery, without a free America, slavery
would continue in the colonies, as it was still common practice throughout the world.


**Show Image 2A-8: The U.S. Constitution**


Even though many people thought that slavery
was wrong, some people insisted that it must
continue. After fighting for independence from
Britain, the 13 new American states had to
come together to decide how they were going

~~_decisions and rules that help a group of people_~~
~~_live together peacefully._~~ Ten years after declaring
independence, each state sent representatives to a series of meetings in 1787.
This was the Constitutional Convention when they would write the Constitution
that would govern the United States. The representatives had many different ideas
on how to govern the new United States of America. The strongest disagreements
centered on slavery.





The Founding Fathers needed to walk a fine line to get all of the 13 states to agree
to adopt the Constitution. Ultimately, they made a compromise, which meant
they found a middle ground. They agreed to allow the institution of slavery but left
open the possibility that slavery would be outlawed ~~_or not allowed_~~ in the future.


During the time of the American Revolution, many people thought that slavery
was going to go away on its own. In some cases, **plantations**, or large farms that


Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**30**


used slave labor to grow tobacco or cotton, were losing money. The slave trade,
where new slaves were brought to America from across the ocean, slowed and
eventually stopped completely. ~~_Why did they stop bringing new slaves across_~~
~~_the ocean to America?_~~


**Show Image 2A-9: Cotton Gin**


Then in 1794, a man named Eli Whitney invented
a machine called the cotton gin. This machine
made harvesting cotton much easier and more
profitable, which led to the growth of slavery.
The cotton gin reduced the labor of removing

for enslaved labor to grow and pick the cotton.
For the South, it meant that more cotton could
be produced cheaply for their use and to export. For the North, the cotton
gin meant more cotton for its textile mills. As a result, some people who had
slaves wanted more land and more slaves to grow and pick cotton. Slavery,
which had been around for thousands of years, did not go away on its own as
many of the Founders anticipated ~~_or expected_~~ ~~.~~ More work would be required to
ensure America truly served as the shining city on the hill.

3. **Inferential.** If the cotton gin made harvesting cotton much easier,
why did the work get harder for enslaved people?


» The work got harder for enslaved people because the demand

for cotton increased. People wanted to grow more cotton to make more
money so they needed more land; more land meant that
more slaves were needed.

of these.)


  - Sharing a toy with a friend even though you want to play with it by yourself


» That’s how you compromise.


  - Deciding to take turns with your sibling when playing a video game


» That’s how you compromise.


  - Refusing to listen to someone else’s idea and only doing things your way

**Show Image 2A-5: The Great Awakening**


 - Many colonists participated in a religious movement to try to convince people

of the importance of following specific religious teachings including that we
are equal in the eyes of God. What was that religious movement called? _(It was_
_called the First Great Awakening.)_


 - What happened during the First Great Awakening? ( _People prayed, sang and_

_listened to preachers. Later, the things the preachers said were written down_
_and shared with many people in the colonies and spread all around.)_

 - Who are the group of men in this picture, and what did they do? _(They are_
_the Founding Fathers; they helped the colonies separate from Great Britain to_
_establish the government of the United States.)_


 - Remind students that some of the Founding Fathers came to believe that
slavery was wrong and should be abolished, but some of the colonists didn’t
agree. Some agreed slavery was wrong, but others thought their businesses
would fail without slaves. So the Founding Fathers tried to come up with a
compromise. What is a compromise?
_(A compromise is when people work together to find a middle ground.)_


 - What was the compromise? _(They agreed to allow the institution of slavery but_
_left open the possibility that slavery would be outlawed, or not allowed, in the_
_future.)_


 - Remind students that some of the Founding Fathers also believed that slavery
was wrong and should be abolished, but some of the colonists didn’t agree.


**Show Image 2A-9: Cotton Gin**


- What was this machine called? ( _It was called the cotton gin.)_


- So instead of slavery going away, the cotton gin increased slavery. Why?
_(Since it made harvesting easier, some people who had slaves wanted more_
_land to grow and pick cotton. Bigger harvests and more land meant more_
_slaves were needed to pick the cotton.)_


Lesson 3 The Abolitionists
**41**


~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION OR TERMS (5 MIN.)**~~


                - Explain that today’s Read-Aloud shows some differences between the
economy of the North and South in the years prior to the Civil War.


                 - Explain that the word _economy_ describes the system in which people make
items to buy, sell, or trade with others who want those items. When people
trade, buy, or sell goods with one another, they are cooperating. Because
of this cooperation, people can get resources, such as food, clothing, and
shelter, that they might not be able to produce or make for themselves. When
more and more people engage in trading, buying, and selling goods, we say
the economy is strong.


                - Explain that the Southern economy was dependent upon the work of slaves
to produce crops, like cotton. The North was dependent upon those crops
produced by slaves in the South for their factories, including southern
cotton needed for northern textile mills. To produce these crops, Southern
plantation owners forced slaves to work on their plantations for no pay and
often with harsh treatment.


                  - Explain that a civil war is a war between two different groups within the
same country, like the North and the South. Remind students that one of the
primary issues between the North and the South was a disagreement over
slavery.

Most farms in the South were small and run entirely by the families that lived
on them. But there were also enormous plantations where the plantation
owners who grew these crops forced hundreds of slaves to work day after
day under horrible conditions for no wages at all. ~~_What is a plantation?_~~ The
crops grown on these plantations were bought by people in the North and as
far away as Great Britain, and that helped the Southern economy grow.


The North had farms, too, but they tended to be smaller, and they didn’t
grow things that were sold to make goods. Farmers in the North grew crops,
~~_or plants that farmers grow on farms mainly,_~~ for feeding people and animals.
There were few slaves in the North.







the South. These plantations could produce the
materials at low cost because they used enslaved labor.





Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War

The factories in the North had access to railroads and shipping ports to
distribute the goods made there. People in the South and as far away as
Great Britain would buy goods from Northern factories, helping the Northern
economy. ~~_What were some things made in Northern factories?_~~ Manufacturing
goods to sell was the most important part of the Northern economy, whereas
farming was the most important part of the Southern economy. ~~_Why do you_~~
~~_think farming was more important in the South?_~~


**Show Image 3A-5: U.S. Map in 1850**


There were economic differences between the
North and the South. Slavery was one of the
biggest differences. Slavery became illegal, or
against the law, in most Northern states. But
even though it was illegal not everyone in the

not a part of their everyday life, some people in
the North didn’t really think much about it.

As you introduce the
Second Great Awakening,
take a moment to remind
students about the
previous discussion on
the First Great Awakening
from Lesson 1.





But there were Americans who did think about slavery, and they thought
it was evil. At the time of the American revolution, many anti-slavery
Americans held strong Christian religious beliefs. After the Revolution
and through the early 1800s, a **Second Great Awakening** spread across
America, inspiring Americans to reconnect with their faith and forcing even
more Americans to confront the evils of slavery. One influential Second Great
Awakening preacher encouraged people to be against slavery: “[T]he silence
of Christians upon the subject,” he said, “is virtually saying that they do not
consider slavery as a sin. The truth is, it is a subject upon which they cannot
be silent without guilt.”


These Christians were absolutely against slavery, no matter what it did
for the economy. These people saw slavery as evil; they thought slaves
should be free and have the same rights as other Americans. People who
worked to abolish, or end, slavery became known as **abolitionists** . ~~_What did_~~
~~abolitionists~~ ~~_want to end?_~~ This group of abolitionists continued to grow larger
and larger over time. Abolitionists wrote to the people in government and held
meetings and conferences. They also gave speeches, printed newspapers and
books, and wrote songs. Abolitionists worked hard to tell everyone how bad
slavery was. They made sure people couldn’t forget about it.


Lesson 3 The Abolitionists
**45**


**Show Image 3A-6: Harriet Beecher Stowe**



In 1852 Harriet Beecher Stowe published
the novel _Uncle Tom’s Cabin_ . Stowe was the
daughter of a famous preacher, and she
was a strong abolitionist. As Stowe writes
in the book’s preface, she set out to awaken

struggles faced by slaves and did just that
through the story in her book. Her story showed that enslaved people were
humans with emotions and drew attention to the harsh things slaves were
forced to endure. ~~_Why was it important to show that enslaved people were_~~
~~_humans with emotions?_~~





The book exploded in popularity. Months after it came out, _The Boston_
_Morning Post_ said that “everybody has read it, is reading, or is about to read it.”
Throughout the 1800s, the only book that sold more copies than _Uncle Tom’s_
_Cabin_ was the Christian Bible. ~~_Why do you think_~~ ~~Uncle Tom’s Cabin~~ ~~_was so_~~
~~_popular?_~~


Abolitionists worked hard to make sure people could not choose to ignore
the evils of slavery. William Lloyd Garrison was one abolitionist who called
for slavery to be immediately abolished. He believed that the lessons of
the Christian Bible taught that slavery must be ended. Garrison was the
publisher of _The Liberator_ —a famous abolitionist newspaper. _The Liberator_
and other abolitionist newspapers included stories about the evils of slavery.


**Show Image 3A-7: Frederick Douglass**


There were many famous abolitionists, but
perhaps none as well-known as Frederick
Douglass. Douglass was born a slave. When he
was young, he learned to read, and then helped
other slaves read the Christian Bible. After he

and sold copies of books about his life. His
writings and speeches were thoughtful and inspiring, and he became one of
the most famous people in America. Douglass also started his own newspaper
called _The North Star._ He wanted his newspaper to remind people of the
**proverb**, ~~_or a saying passed down from generation to generation,_~~ to “Follow
your North Star.” Just like the North Star in the sky, the newspaper was a guide
for enslaved people escaping slavery and traveling toward freedom in the
North. ~~_Why do you think Frederick Douglass wanted to help other slaves learn_~~
~~_to read?_~~





Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**46**


**Show Image 3A-8: Harriet Tubman**



Harriet Tubman was another famous abolitionist.
She would travel to the South and help enslaved
people escape to freedom in the North, in what
became known as the **Underground Railroad** ~~.~~
~~_The_~~ ~~Underground Railroad~~ ~~_was a network of_~~

~~_enslaved people escape to freedom._~~ It took a lot
of planning and coordination, and she risked her life in the process. Abolitionists
helped keep the Underground Railroad running smoothly, making sure that as
many people as possible were able to escape slavery.





By the year 1850, the United States had expanded to 31 states from the
original 13 colonies. Most states in the North were free; slavery was illegal.
The states in the South allowed slavery, and more people continued to be
enslaved. But the abolitionists would not let the country ignore the issue.
They were determined to make America a land of freedom for everyone.


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What did the Southern states depend on for their economy?


» The Southern states depended on agriculture or farming—planting

and taking care of crops like cotton, sugar, and tobacco on small farms
and large plantations.


2. **Literal.** What did the Northern states depend on for their economy?


» In the North, the main focus of the economy was industry and

manufacturing. Workers were paid to make things in factories.


3. **Inferential.** Why do you think some people chose to speak out against
slavery, even if it was legal in some parts of the country?


» People like Harriet Beecher Stowe and Frederick Douglass spoke out

against slavery because they thought it was wrong. Their values and
religious beliefs told them that slavery should be illegal.


4. **Inferential.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ Harriet Beecher Stowe, William Lloyd
Garrison, and Frederick Douglass were abolitionists. What did abolitionists
believe about slavery?


» They thought slavery was wrong and wanted it to end. Abolitionists
believed that everyone should be free; they didn’t like slavery because it
was unfair, and they believed that all people should be treated equally.

» They were influenced by religion and by what they saw; seeing how

badly slaves were treated, they wanted to make it stop. They read
books and stories that made them think slavery was wrong. Some of
them, like Frederick Douglass, had been slaves themselves, and this
made them want to change things. Religious movements like the Great
Awakenings made them think it was important to treat everyone fairly.

This unit discusses slavery, and this lesson helps students understand what it
was like when enslaved people tried to escape. This lesson focuses on Harriet
Tubman and the Underground Railroad. Students should also know that trying
to escape slavery was arduous, and the Underground Railroad was important
for helping enslaved people on their journey. Emphasize the resilience,
bravery, and sacrifices made by individuals like Harriet Tubman, and explain
the risks she took to lead enslaved people to a better life and to make our
country better.

~~_would choose to run away?_~~


**Show Image 4A-2: Flashback of Harriet**
**Growing Strong**


Harriet Tubman grew up in Maryland as an
enslaved person on a plantation. ~~[Display~~
~~U.S. Map, and point to Maryland.]~~ Even at the
young age of six years old, she was forced
to work for no pay all day, every day, for the
plantation owner. Enslaved people like her had
no rights or freedom, and Harriet thought she would be enslaved her entire
life. This is what life was like for millions of slaves around the world when
Harriet was young and for many people, long before Harriet or her parents
and grandparents were born.


When the plantation owner died, Harriet Tubman faced a new danger. It
was likely that she would be sent off to Georgia in the deep South. ~~[Point to~~
~~Georgia on the U.S. Map.]~~ This is where many of the plantations grew cotton
and conditions were even worse for enslaved people. Work on the cotton
plantations was difficult and performed in all types of weather. Harriet knew
she had to run away from her life in slavery.


**Show Image 4A-3: Underground Railroad**


To reach freedom in the North, Harriet
Tubman needed to use the Underground
Railroad. ~~_We read about the Underground_~~
~~_Railroad in the last lesson._~~ Remember, this
was not a real railroad, but a system of secret
routes and hiding places to help people
escape slavery and travel to freedom. ~~_What_~~
~~_do you see in this picture? Do you see a train or a railroad? The arrows in the_~~
~~_picture help show how enslaved people escaped from slavery in the South to_~~
~~_freedom in the North._~~ In certain ways, however, the Underground Railroad
was a lot like an actual railroad.


**Passengers** are often people who journey from one place to another in a
vehicle like a train. The runaway slaves on the Underground Railroad were
also known as passengers. ~~_They were slaves who traveled to freedom_~~ . As
soon as runaways got away from the plantation, they were on an incredible


Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**60**


and difficult journey to freedom, and they could not complete this journey
without help from a conductor. On a real railroad, a conductor is in charge of
the train, but on the Underground Railroad, a conductor guided runaways.
The conductor led them through secret paths and took them to safe houses.
These safe houses were known as stations. Like real train stations, they
were places where passengers could rest before moving on to the next part
of their journey. Many different people from both the North and the South,
who knew slavery was wrong, provided these stations to those who escaped.
~~_What did a conductor on the Underground Railroad do? What were the_~~
~~_enslaved people on the Underground Railroad called? Where did they rest?_~~


**Show Image 4A-4: William Lloyd Garrison and**
**Frederick Douglass**


In the last lesson, we talked about how there
were thousands of abolitionists. ~~_Remember,_~~
~~_abolitionists were people who worked to_~~
~~_abolish, or end, slavery._~~ We learned about
William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick
Douglass, who worked to help slaves achieve
freedom. Frederick Douglass published a newspaper called _The North_
_Star_ after the star in the sky that would guide enslaved people to their
freedom. Harriet Tubman made it safely to freedom in the North using the
Underground Railroad with the North Star to guide her.


**Show Image 4A-5: Harriet Tubman**


Enslaved people like Harriet were free in
northern states like Pennsylvania, where
slavery was not allowed, but Harriet did not
stay in Pennsylvania for long. She missed
her family and friends and could not bear the
thought of them remaining in slavery while
she enjoyed a free, new life. She decided she
had important contributions to make to help those who were still enslaved,
so she became a conductor on the Underground Railroad. ~~_Contributions_~~
~~_can be money, materials, information, or work given by someone to help_~~
~~_others._~~ She returned to the South 19 more times over several years. Each
time, she risked her life to help other enslaved people escape to freedom.
Harriet Tubman was one of the bravest and most famous conductors of the
Underground Railroad. Her name became well known among the supporters
of slavery, and plantation owners put rich rewards out for her capture. Within
a few years, they wanted her stopped at all costs. Even so, she kept going
back, again and again, helping more and more enslaved people escape.



Challenge


Explain the risks an
enslaved person took
to return to the South
after gaining freedom
in the North. Ask: Why
would someone do that?
Have students identify
characteristics that
describe Harriet Tubman
based on her actions.



Lesson 4 Harriet Tubman
**61**


**Show Image 4A-6: Tubman Leading People**
**Out of Swamp**


Now let’s read from a story that imagines
what it would be like for Harriet and those
with her on one of her trips conducting the
Underground Railroad while leading enslaved
people to freedom.


It was nighttime in 1856. Harriet was startled
by the distant sound of strangers yelling. She knew danger was near.


“Wake up, now. Wake up!” she urged, shaking the men and women. “Gather
up these babies. We’ve got to get a move on.”


The men and women sprang to their feet with fear and panic.


“Don’t you worry now,” she assured them. “I know a station not too far from
here, but we’ll have to move fast, and we’ll have to stay in the creek to keep
the men off our trail.” They hurried out of the swamp and splashed up the
creek. An hour later, soaked in sweat and muddy creek water, they arrived in
the front yard of a small farmhouse. ~~_What was a station on the Underground_~~
~~_Railroad?_~~


**Show Image 4A-7: Woman Helping the**
**Fugitives**


The runaway slaves hid in the weeds while
Harriet Tubman slipped through the yard
and onto the front porch. She tapped three
times on the door, waited a moment, and then
tapped two more times. ~~[Demonstrate this~~
~~secret knock.]~~ This was a secret knock. The
people in the house would know their visitor was an Underground Railroad
conductor in need of help. ~~[~~ ~~_Why do you think they needed a secret knock?]_~~


After hearing the secret knock, a white woman opened the door. The woman
signaled for the runaways to follow her into the chicken coop ~~_(a place where_~~
~~_chickens live)_~~ . There, she lifted a trapdoor in the floor, revealing a dark hole.


“It’s not comfortable,” she told them, “but nobody will find you here. I have
some stew and biscuits inside, and fresh milk. I’ll bring it out as soon as the
coast is clear.”


Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**62**


Their hearts raced as they waited in their hideout. ~~_Why were their hearts_~~
~~_racing? How do you think they were feeling?_~~ Running through the creek had
thrown the catchers off the trail, and for now, the runaways were safe. They
wanted to sleep, but when the sun went down, they had to move on again.
There was no time to waste because nighttime was the only safe time to
travel. ~~_Why do you think nighttime was the safest time to travel?_~~


**Show Image 4A-8: Tubman Pointing Out the**
**“Drinking Gourd”**


Outside, Harriet Tubman looked up to the
starry sky. She put her arm around one of
the children. “See there?” she said, pointing
upward. “That group of stars up there . . . It
kind of looks like what you might use to scoop
water from a bucket. Back where I’m from, we
used to call it a drinking **gourd** . ~~[Show Image Card 5 (Hollowed-out Gourd).]~~
~~_A_~~ ~~gourd~~ ~~_is a plant with a hard-shelled fruit that is sometimes dried and_~~
~~_hollowed out to be used as a tool._~~ Do you see it?”


“I think so,” the child said.


“Now, see the ‘cup’ of that drinking gourd?” Harriet Tubman asked. “Look at
the two stars at the end of the cup and pretend you can draw a straight line
from those two stars, straight out into space. If you follow that line straight
out, you will find the North Star. It is always there, right in the same spot, and
you can always find it if you know how to find the drinking gourd in the sky.
Do you know why that star is so important?”


“Why?” the child asked.


“Because the North Star is always to the north and one of the brightest in
the sky. If we follow the North Star every night and keep it in front of us, then
it will guide us north to freedom.”


And heading North to freedom is exactly what they did.

Lesson 4 Harriet Tubman
**63**


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** Why did Harriet Tubman decide to fight back rather than accept her
life as an enslaved person?


» Harriet Tubman was afraid she would be sent off to the deep South.
This is where many of the plantations grew cotton and conditions were
even worse for enslaved people. She ran away because she thought she
could make it to the North.


2. **Literal.** What was the Underground Railroad?


» It was a secret path of routes and hiding places to help enslaved people
escape from slavery in the South to freedom in the North.


3. **Literal.** Was the Underground Railroad a real railroad?


» No.


4. **Literal.** Who were the passengers on the Underground Railroad?


» Slaves trying to escape


5. **Literal.** Name one conductor of the Underground Railroad.


» Harriet Tubman


6. **Literal.** What were Harriet Tubman’s contributions to help enslaved people
escape slavery and win their freedom?


» She became a conductor on the Underground Railroad; she went back
and helped her family and many other enslaved people escape their
unfair lives in slavery.


7. **Inferential.** Why did Harriet Tubman choose to be a conductor on the
Underground Railroad and risk her own life to help other enslaved people?


» She wanted them to be free like she was.


8. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ What do you think about the actions Harriet
Tubman took to help enslaved people gain their freedom? Use details from
the story to explain your answer.


» Answers may vary but should include an understanding of the
following: Harriet Tubman was kind to help people escape even when
it was dangerous. She was like a hero guiding people through the
Underground Railroad in the dark with people chasing them. Harriet
Tubman was brave and it must have been hard for her because she had
to be careful with catchers. She was smart to remember the way and to
use the North Star as a guide in the dark.

Challenge


Ask students to use the
words around _illegal_ to
figure out what it means.



~~_This land included the state of Louisiana._~~ At first, all of that land was
organized as territories. Territories had a small number of people and started
to set up small governments of their own until they were organized enough
to become states.


Each time a territory wanted to become a state, **Congress** had to vote to
admit the state into the Union. In the first half of the 1800s, this came with
a big question. Would the state allow people to be slaves, or would it make
slavery illegal? In other words, would it be a slave state or a free state?


This only made the disagreements about slavery worse, because each time
a state was admitted into the national government compromises needed
to be made. There were **tense** debates, or ~~_debates that caused feelings of_~~
~~_nervousness and suspense_~~, between those who wanted to keep slavery and
those who wanted to abolish it. ~~_Why do you think the debates were_~~ ~~tense~~ ~~_or_~~
~~_stressful?_~~ The Founding Fathers, who thought slavery would go away on its
own, realized the problem was only getting worse. Former President Thomas
Jefferson wrote to a friend in 1820 about one of the early compromises made
in Congress to admit free and slave states at the same time: “[the] question,
like a fire bell in the night, awakened and filled me with terror. I considered
it at once as the [death] knell of the Union.” ~~_A knell is the sound a bell_~~
~~_makes when it rings. In this case, President Jefferson was worried that this_~~
~~_compromise to keep slavery was like a bell signaling that the United States_~~
~~_might stop being a country._~~ Jefferson went on to write, “This is a reprieve
only, not a final sentence.” ~~_A reprieve happens when you get a temporary_~~
~~_or short relief from punishment. In this case, President Jefferson noted that_~~
~~_compromise was only a temporary way of dealing with the question of slavery,_~~
~~_but that the problem of slavery would still need to be addressed._~~



Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**78**


Dozens of states joined the Union in the first half of the 1800s, and each
time, the question of whether it would be a free state or a slave state had
to be answered. Let’s go back to the year 1850, when Harriet Tubman
escaped from a life of slavery in the South by running away to Pennsylvania,
a Northern state where slavery was not allowed. ~~[Display the U.S. Map and~~
~~point to the state of Pennsylvania.]~~ To divide the North and the South on
a map of the United States, it is easiest if you use what is known as the
**Mason-Dixon Line.** The Mason-Dixon Line is an imaginary line between the
border of Pennsylvania and Maryland. ~~[Point to the Mason-Dixon Line on~~
~~the map.]~~ It was named after two Englishmen, Charles Mason and Jeremiah
Dixon, who surveyed ~~_or looked carefully at_~~ land almost 100 years earlier.
The Mason-Dixon Line became an imaginary line between the North and the
South. ~~[Refer again to the Mason-Dixon Line on the map.] Were~~ ~~_the slave_~~
~~_states above or below the_~~ ~~Mason-Dixon line~~ ~~_?_~~


Slavery was generally allowed in the South, below the Mason-Dixon Line, but
slavery was not generally allowed in the North, above the Mason-Dixon Line.

~~[Identify and point to some of the states north and south of the Mason-Dixon~~
~~line on the Image 5A-2.]~~ But this was not automatic ~~_or already decided._~~ Each
time a state was allowed to join the Union, the question had to be decided,
which meant more and more arguments over slavery. Sometimes, those
arguments became violent.


~~[Point to the unorganized territory above Texas.] C~~ onsider ~~_or think about_~~
what happened in Kansas. Today, Kansas is a state, but in the 1850s, Kansas
was still a territory. When it was considering whether to become a state, it
needed to decide whether slavery was going to be permitted or outlawed.
People from all over the United States, from the North and the South, from
free states and slave states, traveled to Kansas, sometimes only to have a
chance to influence that decision. Some of them got into fights, and some
people even died.



Challenge


Encourage students to
think about why people
disagreed about being a
free state or a slave state.


Support


Remind students that
people felt very strongly
about states being free
states or slave states.
Many people traveled to
Kansas to influence the
decision.



Lesson 5 A House Divided
**79**


Support


Remind students
that enslaved people
were unhappy with
the conditions they
were living in and were
rebelling or fighting to
be free.



The violence was not limited to territories that
were becoming states. In many of the states
back in the East, violence was breaking out
between plantation owners who wanted to keep

to become free or abolitionists working to end
slavery. ~~_Look at this picture; what does it tell you about how enslaved people_~~
~~_might have felt?_~~ One such event took place in Virginia in the area that is now
known as Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. ~~[Display the U.S. Map and point to~~
~~the state of West Virginia.]~~ In that event, an abolitionist named John Brown
tried to get guns and other weapons to enslaved people to help them **rebel**
against the plantation owners. ~~_What does it mean to_~~ ~~rebel~~ ~~_?_~~ In another event,
an enslaved person named Nat Turner led a group of slaves to rebel against
plantation owners in Virginia ~~. [Point to the state of Virginia on the U.S. Map.]~~
In South Carolina, another former slave named Denmark Vesey helped plan a
large rebellion against plantation owners in Charleston, ~~[Point to the state of~~
~~South Carolina on the U.S. Map.]~~ but his plan was discovered before it could
be carried out. There were also many, many small acts of rebellion by slaves
against those who enslaved them. Even in the years leading up to the Civil
War, there were many violent events in which many people lost their lives in
the struggle to end slavery.

**Show Image 5A-4: Abraham Lincoln’s**
**Early Home**

During these years of growing tension over slavery, a **humble**, ~~_or respectful_~~, leader emerged
from the backwoods of what was then the
American West. His name was Abraham Lincoln.



Lincoln was born in a one-room log cabin in
1809 in Kentucky. He was born very poor but learned the value of hard work
at a young age. Lincoln’s parents could not read or write. He spent little time
in local schools because he had to work to help support his family. Instead
of going to school to learn, Lincoln taught himself by reading books that he
borrowed. When he was not working on his family’s farm, he loved to learn and
was an **avid** reader. He read and re-read the Christian Bible throughout his
life. ~~_So far, what are some things we have heard about Abraham Lincoln?_~~


Lincoln had many jobs. He was a shopkeeper and a postmaster, and he
worked on a small riverboat. ~~_(Postmasters helped to deliver mail.)_~~ He taught


Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**80**


himself law and became a lawyer in 1836. Ten years later, Lincoln was
**elected** as a Congressman in the U.S. House of Representatives. Abraham
Lincoln was a man of such **integrity** that he earned the nickname “Honest
Abe.” ~~_What words in that sentence help us know what_~~ ~~integrity~~ ~~_means?_~~


Abraham Lincoln spent much of his life living in the Northern, free states. He
was firmly against slavery’s expansion.


In 1858, years before Lincoln would run for President, Lincoln became the
Republican candidate running to become a U.S. Senator for the state of
Illinois. The country was on edge over whether slavery would expand to new
states. ~~_What might it mean to be on edge?_~~



**Show Image 5A-5: President Lincoln**
Speaking at the 1858 Illinois Republican State
Convention, Lincoln gave a historic campaign
speech. He argued that there should be no
compromise on the issue of whether to allow
slavery in the United States. Our nation was

supported slavery. There was no in-between.
Lincoln was a man with deeply held Christian beliefs, and like abolitionists
throughout the country, Lincoln made it clear that he was on the side of
freedom to keep the country united. ~~_Based on Lincoln’s speech, if he won_~~
~~_the presidency, do you think he would fight to keep slavery or free the slaves?_~~
~~_How do you know?_~~





Lincoln declared, “‘A house divided against itself cannot stand.’ I believe this
government cannot **endure**, permanently, half slave and half free. I do not
expect the Union to be dissolved; I do not expect the house to fall; but I do
expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.”
Lincoln’s “house divided” was a quote spoken by Jesus in the Christian Bible
and was widely understood by Americans at that time. The Bible quotes
Jesus as saying: “Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and
every city or household divided against itself will not stand.” ~~_What did Lincoln_~~
~~_mean by “it will become all one thing, or all the other?”_~~

Think about the phrase
“a house divided.” When
Lincoln used those words
from the Christian Bible,
do you think Lincoln was
talking about an actual
house or something else?
_(He was talking about_
_America.)_ How is the
country like a huge house?
_(We are all connected_
_under one land and_

conflict of slavery divide
the country? _(The North_
_and South disagreed on_
_whether to keep slavery_
_alive or abolish it.)_

united using your hands.
Ask students to place
the palms of their hands

together. Now pull them
apart. Say: This is divided

Say: This is united, which

means together. Lincoln
wanted the country to be

united, or stay together.



Lincoln was one of two politicians running in
the 1858 election for the U.S. Senate in Illinois.
~~_(Politicians are part of a government, which_~~
~~_is a group of people who help lead a country.)_~~

named Stephen Douglas. Lincoln did not want
to see slavery expanded into any new states, and he thought that Congress
should make laws to prevent it from expanding. Douglas thought the question of slavery should be answered by each state, and the power of Congress
should be limited. The two politicians participated in many debates, and both
men made intelligent, ~~_or smart_~~, arguments. Their arguments were written
down and published in newspapers and books. These Lincoln-Douglas debates became famous, with people all over America following the two politicians and their ideas.



**Show Image: 5A-6: Lincoln Standing to**
**Debate Douglas**





Lincoln lost that year’s Illinois Senate election to the Democrat Stephen
Douglas, but the anti-slavery arguments he made in the Lincoln-Douglas debates skyrocketed him to national fame. ~~_This means that many people knew_~~
~~_him and believed in him._~~ He became the leading figure of the Republican party. The Republican party had been newly formed in the United States, founded on the goal of abolition. ~~_Do you remember what abolition means?_~~ Two
years later, Lincoln was the Republican nominee for President. No state in
the South voted for him. But voters from every free state in the North chose
to elect Lincoln as President, and that was enough for him to win. He became
the 16th President of the United States in 1861. Those supporting abolition
looked to Lincoln to help negotiate an end to slavery in the country. ~~Negoti-~~
~~ate~~ ~~_means to come to an agreement in a respectful way so that both sides can_~~
~~_live with the results._~~ Yet those in the South could see no compromise with
Lincoln. Many people in the South believed that President Lincoln wanted to
take away their right as a state to set their own laws and, specifically, that
he wanted to abolish slavery. The reprieve from conflict on the question of
slavery was about to come to an end. The Civil War would soon begin.

1. **Inferential.** What did Abraham Lincoln believe about slavery?


» He believed slavery needed to end. He felt ending slavery was important
to moving the country forward in a good way.


2. **Evaluative.** Do you believe America is stronger united or divided? Why?


» Answers may vary but should indicate that being united makes us
stronger.


3. **Evaluative.** Why do you think Lincoln thought there was no in-between—that
the United States was either a nation that supported slavery or one that
stood for freedom?


» Answers may vary but should indicate that it would be impossible for a
country founded on a belief that all men are created equal to treat some
as slaves.

**Turn and Talk:** With your partner, discuss how you think President
Lincoln felt about slavery and where his views came from.


[Have several students share their responses with the class.]


» Northern “free states” believed slavery should be illegal because
it is wrong. Lincoln agreed with them for several reasons. He grew
up in a free state. He also felt slavery was dividing the country, so
ending it was important to unify the country.

and many others feared and hoped would
never happen. Several Southern states
**seceded** or declared they were no longer part
of the United States.


South Carolina was the first state to secede. The states of Mississippi,
Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas soon followed. ~~[Point to the~~

government would force them to do things they did not want to do. One of
those things was abolishing ~~_or ending_~~ slavery.


These Southern states strongly believed that they should be in charge
of themselves, particularly regarding slavery. So they broke away. They
declared ~~_or said_~~ that they were forming their own country. They called their
new country the Confederate States of America, or the **Confederacy** . The
Confederacy elected its own president, a man named Jefferson Davis. ~~_Why_~~
~~_did these Southern states secede?_~~


**Show Image 6A-2: Battle Scene**


But Lincoln was not going to allow the United
States of America to be broken up into two
separate countries. Lincoln said that it was
against national law for a state to secede.
Therefore, he said that he would do everything
in his power to **unify** ~~_or bring together the_~~

wanted a peaceful solution, war became impossible to avoid. ~~_Why did war_~~
~~_become impossible to avoid?_~~


**Show Image 6A-3: Charleston in 1861**


This was even clearer shortly after Lincoln was
sworn in as president in March 1861.


In the city of Charleston, South Carolina, there
was a large and important fort called Fort
Sumter. ~~[Display the U.S. Map, and point to~~
~~Charleston, South Carolina.]~~ Charleston was
a major **port city**, ~~_or a city on the water with a loading area where ships can_~~
~~_bring and take goods,_~~ and from its harbor, valuable goods were carried by
ships across the sea. ~~[Use the U.S. Map to show how Charleston was a port~~
~~city with access to the water.]~~ Forts had large cannons and many soldiers.
They were built to protect the harbor from invasion by pirates and enemy
ships in times of war. ~~_Look at the picture, what do you see that shows you_~~
~~_Charleston is a port city?_~~



Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War

**Show Image 6A-4: Fort Sumter**


Fort Sumter was a United States federal
fort located in South Carolina. After South
Carolina seceded from the Union, federal
soldiers continued to occupy the fort and the
Confederates wanted them to leave because
it was located in Confederate territory. The
states that had seceded viewed themselves
as an independent nation with their own government and an army. The
Confederacy would lose the respect of foreign nations if they allowed the U.S.
to have troops within their territory. The Confederates asked the soldiers to
**surrender**, ~~_or give up,_~~ but they refused because they knew President Lincoln
wanted to maintain the fort as federal property and had made the decision
to send supplies. News of supplies coming pushed the South to respond.
Confederate soldiers fired shots at the fort and the federal soldiers in the early
morning hours of April 12, 1861.


**Show Image 6A-5: Map of All States That**
**Seceded from the Union**


A civil war is a war fought between people of the
same nation. Usually, in a civil war, two or more
groups of citizens in a country strongly believe
in something. They fight each other to get their
way. The war that began with the Battle of Fort
Sumter would later come to be known as the
U.S. Civil War, or the War Between the States. It was an awful time in American
history. ~~_Why was it awful for people in the same country to be at war?_~~


After the Battle of Fort Sumter, more Southern states joined the Confederacy,
including Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina, as well as
portions of Kentucky and Missouri. In all, there were 13 Confederate states, all
from the South. ~~[Point to show the new states that joined the Confederacy.]~~


**Show Image 6A-6: Union Flag and**

after the Battle of Fort Sumter when more states joined. ~~[Point to the flag on~~

The remaining states, those that had not seceded, were in the North. These
states were known as the Union. For most of our history, the word _Union_ is
what we refer to as all of our states working together as one. But during the
Civil War, _Union_ only referred to the states that did not secede. States in the
Union continued to fly the traditional flag of the United States, pictured at
the top, which at the time of the Civil War had 34 stars—one for each state,
including the Confederate states. ~~_What message was the Union sending by_~~
~~_flying a flag with 34 stars, including Confederate states?_~~


Both sides—the Union and the Confederacy—built up their armies as quickly as
possible. Throughout the North, people wanted President Lincoln to do whatever
he could to end the war quickly, and most people assumed that the war _would_ end
quickly. After all, the Union had more people, more factories, a larger army, and a
powerful navy. ~~_Name a reason most people thought the war would end quickly._~~


The first true test between the armies of the North and the South came in
July 1861 in the state of Virginia. ~~[Point to Virginia on the U.S. Map.]~~ Virginia
is home to the city of Richmond, which was the capital of the Confederacy at
the time of the Civil War. Today, Richmond is the capital of Virginia. Virginia
also touches Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. ~~[Point to~~
~~Washington, D.C. on the U.S. Map.]~~ Three months after the Battle of Fort
Sumter, thousands of Union and Confederate soldiers met in Virginia for
the first major battle of the Civil War. ~~_Were the Union soldiers fighting for the_~~
~~_North or the South? What about the Confederate soldiers?_~~


As president, Abraham Lincoln was commander in chief of the U.S. Army,
also called the Union Army. He decided to try to end the war quickly. He sent
his army to destroy the Confederate Army in Virginia and capture its capital,
the city of Richmond. The Union Army moved toward the town of Manassas,
where there was a small river called Bull Run.


**Show Image 6A-7: General McDowell and the**
**Army of the Potomac**


The plan was for the Union Army to defeat
whatever forces the Confederacy tried to put
in its path. Then, they would march on and
attack Richmond. The Union Army had 35,000
soldiers. Up to that day, this was the single
largest army ever formed in America. The



Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**102**


Union did not realize, however, that the Confederate Army, or the **Rebels** as
they were also called, had roughly the same number of soldiers in the area.


That July, the Virginia summer heat was so hot it was sometimes hard
to breathe. Union soldiers, many wearing heavy wool clothing, marched
slowly for two days over rolling farmland and across shallow, muddy creeks.
~~_After hearing that sentence, what pictures can you see in your mind?_~~ The
Confederate soldiers waited for them at Manassas.


By July 21, it was clear that the armies were going to **clash** ~~_or have a big_~~
~~_conflict or disagreement._~~ The Confederates decided to attack.


As the Confederates marched across the field, the Union guns opened fire. It
was hard to see what was happening in the smoke-filled air, but it was clear
that the quick victory the Union and their supporters had hoped for was not
coming to pass ~~_or happening._~~


Instead, amid the firing of cannons and rifles, a new sound rang out. This
sound would come to be known as the Rebel Yell. It was a battle cry, which
the Confederates yelled out as they attacked the Union Army. Despite careful
planning, almost nothing went right for the Union Army.


The Confederate cannons were older and less powerful than the Union’s
cannons, but the Confederate soldiers firing them seemed to have more skill.
~~_How do you think Lincoln and the Union soldiers felt at this point?_~~


**Show Image 6A-8: Stonewall Jackson**


Several of the Confederate commanders
seemed to be more capable than the Union
commanders, as well. One commander,
General Thomas Jackson, earned the nickname
Stonewall Jackson when he and his forces
stood like a stone wall against the Union attack.

~~[Point to the picture of Stonewall Jackson.]~~

Roads, bridges, and entire hillsides lay in ruins.


This was just the first of many, many battles
in the years of the Civil War. After that first
battle, which was called the First Battle of Manassas or the First Battle of
Bull Run, President Lincoln and others in the North realized that this Civil
War would not be easy to win. ~~_What made President Lincoln realize that the_~~
~~_war would not be easy?_~~


The Union realized that they would need a much larger army. More
importantly, they would need to prepare for a much longer war. In fact, within
a year, many people were wondering whether the Union would be able to win
the war at all.

_may vary depending on each student’s experience.)_


        - saying hello to your teacher


        - saying hello to your baby brother


       - saying hello to your great-grandmother


        - saying hello to your friend’s parents


        - saying hello to your friend’s brother or sister


~~**SAYINGS AND PHRASES: “EASIER SAID THAN DONE” (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain to students that proverbs are short, traditional sayings that have
been passed along orally from generation to generation.


 - These sayings usually express general truths based on experiences and
observations of everyday life. Whereas some proverbs do have literal
meanings—that is, they mean exactly what they say—many proverbs have a
richer meaning beyond the literal level.


 - Ask students if they have ever heard the saying “easier said than done.” Have
students repeat the saying.


 - Explain that if something is “easier said than done,” it is easier to say how the
task should be completed than it is to actually complete the task.


 - Explain that if someone had said to President Lincoln, “This war should be
over by now,” he may have said, “That is easier said than done.”


 - Ask students if they have ever faced a task that was more difficult to
complete than originally thought. Give students the opportunity to share
their experiences and encourage them to use the saying.


 - Try to find opportunities to use this saying in various situations in the
classroom.

~~**“BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC” (15 MIN.)**~~

~~_Look at the picture. What does it show you_~~
~~_about the war?_~~ The Civil War was a time of
great **sacrifice** ~~_or giving up important things_~~
~~_for something else_~~ in American history. Many
people were ready to fight for what they
believed in. Many were even willing to give up
their lives. They believed it was a very
important **cause** ~~_or idea or goal that people_~~
~~_were interested in supporting._~~


By some measures, more American soldiers died during the Civil War
than in all other American wars combined. More than 600,000 Union and
Confederate soldiers lost their lives by the end of the war. Additionally, well
over a million men were wounded or injured in the Civil War.


Americans were no strangers to the horrors and death brought on by war.
During the Revolutionary War, many people were hurt and houses and towns
were damaged. In the War of 1812, there were fights on ships in the water,

and buildings were burned down on land. However, the Civil War proved to be
far more devastating ~~_or destructive_~~ than any war before it. For example, at
the Battle of Antietam in 1862, there were more than 21,000 **casualties** in a
single day. That means that about one of every six soldiers who took the field
that day at Antietam was either killed or wounded within a few hours.


Advancements in weaponry made the war very dangerous. ~~_Weapons were_~~
~~_made better and were easier to use._~~ And unlike other wars, both sides who
fought were Americans. The Civil War pitted “brother against brother,” and
every casualty was an American soldier.


**Show Image 7A-2: African American Union**
**troops**


The soldiers of the Union Army fought for
many different reasons. Some fought because
they saw joining the fight as their patriotic
duty ~~_or responsibility to the country._~~ They

that the Southern states were rebelling and
they thought what those states were doing was **treason** . Others supported
the idea of emancipation, which means freeing a person from slavery. For
example, Harriet Tubman, the abolitionist you learned about earlier, led a raid
of 150 African American soldiers which ended up freeing 700 slaves. She is
credited as being the first woman to lead US soldiers into battle.



Support


Remind students that
the Civil War was fought
by Americans against
Americans, so when the
author says, “brother
against brother,” in most
cases it is figurative
language that means
American against
American. But there
were battles in which
brothers within the same
family were on opposing
sides of the war and
fought each other in
battle.


Support


Students may seek to
understand what 10
percent means. Explain
to students that for
every 10 Union soldiers,
one of them was Black.





There were also nearly 180,000 Black soldiers who fought for the Union. This
was about 10 percent of the total Union Army. These Black soldiers wanted
to fight for their freedom, and they made many significant contributions
during the war. ~~_Look at the picture. What do you see?_~~


**Show Image 7A-3: Frederick Douglass**


As the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass
said, “[L]et the Black man get upon his person
the brass letters U.S., let him get an eagle
on his button, and a musket ~~_or gun_~~ on his
shoulder and bullets in his pockets, and there
is no power on earth which can deny that
he has earned the right of citizenship in the
United States.” ~~_What was Frederick Douglass’s belief about African Americans_~~
~~_joining the Union Army?_~~


Lesson 7 Battle Hymn of the Republic

Support


Explain to students that
the soldiers were human
and felt emotions like
you and me. When times
were hard during the
war, the hymn kept them
encouraged to keep
going.



**Show Image 7A-4: Union Soldiers with Their**
**Equipment and a Drum**


All the brave soldiers made enormous sacrifices.
Fighting on the battlefield was dangerous and
could be scary. Even when they weren’t in a
battle, there were still many difficulties, such as
having enough food and warm clothes as they
moved from one battlefield to another. They
took a stand for what was right and to save our new nation, but we must not
forget that these Union soldiers were humans, too. There were times that they
were anxious ~~_or nervous,_~~ homesick, or even bored. There were times when they
were tired, injured, sick, hungry, and cold. They had to find a way to stay focused
on the noble cause of preserving ~~_or saving_~~ the Union and bringing slavery to
an end. One of the ways that the soldiers boosted their morale, or their mood,
when times were tough was through music. ~~_Why do you think it was important_~~
~~_for soldiers to be in a better mood?_~~


**Show Image 7A-5: Julia Ward Howe**


In November 1861, poet and abolitionist Julia
Ward Howe went to Washington, D.C. to visit
Union troops. Howe was with her minister who
encouraged her to write a song to inspire the
soldiers, and that she did! She wrote a hymn,
or a song of praise to God, that became known
as “Battle Hymn of the Republic.” ~~[Display~~
~~“Battle Hymn of the Republic” Lyrics.]~~


The “Battle Hymn of the Republic” became very popular among Union
troops. It also became popular with all their supporters at home. There were
many families throughout the North whose fathers, brothers, and sons were
fighting in the war, and the song was a reminder of why the war needed to be
fought. ~~_Why did the Civil War need to be fought?_~~ Throughout history, people
have turned to poetry and music to inspire them to work through difficulties
toward important causes. This hymn reminded the people and soldiers of the
Union that they were fighting for a just ~~_or morally right_~~ cause. Long after the
war was over, the lyrics of the song have been quoted by many in America
who are fighting to support freedom and justice. ~~_How do poetry and music_~~
~~_help people?_~~

make sacrifices if it meant doing the right thing.

~~**“THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 8A-1: Samuel and Violet**
**Gathering with Others Around a Soldier**


~~_What do you think is happening in this picture?_~~


“Gather in closer! Closer everyone!” the soldier
cried out. The people gathered beneath a massive
~~_or very large_~~ oak tree. It was a bitter cold day in
January 1863. A 10-year-old boy named Samuel
and his little sister Violet squeezed and prodded their way through the crowd.


“Let’s keep going to the front,” Samuel said, tugging Violet’s hand.


“No, let’s stay here in the middle where it’s warm,” said Violet, thankful to have so
many bodies pressed close around to shield her from the freezing January wind.


**Show Image 8A-2: Soldier Holding Up a Scroll**


“Fine, you stay here. But I’m going up front so I
can hear,” said Samuel.


“You don’t even know what he’s going to talk
about,” Violet said as her brother wormed his
way toward the tree.


**TEKS 2.6.G** Evaluate details read to determine key ideas; **TEKS 2.3.B** Use context within and beyond a sentence to determine
the meaning of unfamiliar words.



Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**130**


Finally, Violet gave in and followed her brother to the very front. There, a
Union soldier, wearing a long, heavy blue coat, held a scroll, a rolled piece of
paper.


“What is it, some kind of news?” asked a woman in the crowd.


“What happened? What’s on that piece of paper?” asked another. Everyone
wanted to hear the announcement. ~~_What do you think the scroll will say?_~~


**Show Image 8A-3 Soldier Reading from the**
**Scroll**


The tree where the people were gathering was
in a place called Hampton, Virginia. ~~[Display~~
~~the U.S. Map and point to Virginia.]~~ ~~_Was_~~
~~_Virginia a Union or Confederate state?_~~


Hampton was different from other places in
Virginia. Fort Monroe, which was in Hampton, was still under Union control,
unlike Fort Sumter and so many other forts controlled by the Confederates.
The Union soldiers also controlled the nearby port and town. During the
war, many escaped slaves came to Fort Monroe. They hoped to be safe from
catchers. Eventually, a community of free African Americans sprung up
around the town of Hampton. That is why, on this day in 1863, a large group
of free African Americans were gathering under the giant oak tree in Virginia
to listen to the Union soldier. ~~_So, how was this part of Virginia different from_~~
~~_other parts of Virginia and other Confederate states?_~~


Samuel and Violet had been born into slavery. They and their parents
escaped at the beginning of the war, and they had been living in Hampton
ever since.


“Quiet!” the soldier called. “Quiet, please!”


When everyone was settled, the soldier read the first words: “By the
President of the United States of America: A **Proclamation** .” ~~_This means it is_~~
~~_an official announcement from President Lincoln._~~


The soldier waited a moment. Everyone knew right away that they were
about to hear something very important. It was not every day that the
president sent out written proclamations. The soldier continued reading.


“Whereas, on the twenty-second day of September, in the year of our Lord
one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, a proclamation was issued by the
President of the United States, containing, among other things, the following,
to wit . . .”


Lesson 8 The Emancipation Proclamation
**131**


**Show Image 8A-4 People Cheering: Samuel**
**and Violet Trying to Understand**


“What did he just say?” Violet asked eagerly,
tugging on Samuel’s sleeve.


“I’m not really sure,” he replied. “It was just a
fancy way of saying the date, I think. ~~_The date_~~
~~_was September 22, 1862._~~ Now let’s listen!”


The soldier read some more: “That on the first day of January . . . all persons
held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State . . . shall be then,
thenceforward, and forever free.”


The crowd gasped with relief and joy. “Read that again!” someone shouted,
interrupting the soldier. “I want to make sure I heard you right.” Many people
in the crowd had been enslaved at one time. They were very happy to hear
that President Lincoln was proclaiming an end to slavery.


Samuel and Violet listened to the rest of it, but when it was over, Violet did
not really understand most of what she had heard. “So, does this mean that
we don’t have to worry about being captured by the catchers anymore?” she
asked Samuel.


“I think so,” Samuel answered, rubbing his chin. “I think President Lincoln
said all the slaves are now free, but I’m not really sure. We’ll have to ask
Mother what it all means.”


**Show Image 8A-5: President Lincoln and the**
**Emancipation Proclamation**


The document the soldier read is one of the
most famous documents in the history of the
United States. It is called the Emancipation
Proclamation. ~~Emancipation~~ ~~_is the act of_~~
~~_setting something or someone free. What_~~
~~_is a proclamation?_~~ The Emancipation
Proclamation freed slaves in the South. But in the United States, a President
can’t act alone. Congress needed to enact laws to abolish, or end, slavery.
A few years after Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, Congress
did something important: It changed the Constitution to abolish slavery
permanently. Slavery was eventually abolished ~~_or ended_~~ in all states;
however, this didn’t happen only because of the Emancipation Proclamation.


Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**132**


**Show Image 8A-6: Lincoln Reading the**
**Emancipation Proclamation Before His**
**Cabinet**


Slavery was a major reason that the nation
was divided in the first place. But the reason
President Lincoln declared war was that
the Confederacy broke national law by
seceding from the Union. In other words, in
the beginning, the Civil War was focused on keeping the nation united. The
Emancipation Proclamation changed this.


The Emancipation Proclamation changed the focus and purpose of the war
at a time when things were not going well for the Union. This was before
the Battle of Gettysburg, which took place in July 1863. The Union had
not won many battles, yet tens of thousands of men were already dead or
wounded. There was no end in sight to the war. ~~_So what did the Emancipation_~~
~~_Proclamation do and not do? (It changed the war, but it didn’t end the war.)_~~


Many people, including his closest advisors, wanted President Lincoln to end
the war and let the Confederacy have its way. This picture shows Lincoln
just having read the Proclamation to his cabinet or group of advisors. Some
thought it was a good idea, and some did not, but President Lincoln did
what he knew was the right thing to do. The Emancipation Proclamation let
everyone know that not only was President Lincoln determined to preserve,
or save, the Union, but also he wanted to make sure that slavery would never
cause another war. This made the abolitionists very happy, and after that,
they put their full support behind President Lincoln and the war. ~~_Who were_~~
~~_abolitionists?_~~


**Show Image 8A-7: The Spirit of Freedom**
**Sculpture**


As another result of the Emancipation
Proclamation, free African Americans and
escaped slaves began to fight for the Union.
The famous abolitionist Frederick Douglass
helped recruit African Americans. This
means that he encouraged them to join the
Union Army as soldiers. Many African Americans did join the Union Army
and fought courageously. African American men and women were eager ~~_or_~~
~~_excited_~~ to help the Union Army in other ways, too. ~~_Why do you think African_~~
~~_Americans wanted to fight in the Civil War or help support the Union?_~~ Men
worked as carpenters, cooks, guards, laborers, and boat pilots. African
American women were nurses, spies, and scouts. Men and women who

Reread this sentence

did not, but President
Lincoln did what he
knew was the right
thing to do.” Explain that

was right—abolishing
slavery and making sure
it would never cause
another war—even when
his closest advisors and
others did not agree with

**Show Image 8A-8: Emancipation Oak**


From that day forward, the great oak tree
in Hampton, Virginia, became known as
Emancipation Oak. It was the first place
the Emancipation Proclamation was read in
Confederate territory. After the Emancipation
Proclamation, the Union Army freed slaves
each time it won a battle and took control of
a town or some farmland in a Southern state. Little by little, slavery in the
United States was finally coming to an end.


Check for Understanding


**With a Partner:** With your partner, write at least one reason President
Lincoln is considered a courageous president. [Have several students
share their responses with the class.]


» Answers may vary but may include that issuing the Emancipation

Proclamation was courageous because, at the time, some of

his advisors were suggesting he just end the war and let the

Confederacy have its way. President Lincoln instead chose to

issue the Emancipation Proclamation and try to keep the Union

together.

around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, were all
destroyed, so that one could hardly tell that
there had been crops there at all. ~~[Display the~~
~~U.S Map and point to Gettysburg.]~~ Green,
grassy pastures trampled by so many boots and horse hooves were now

edge of the battlefield. Several Confederate officers paced back and forth in
the yard.


“Should we see if he is ready to issue orders?”


“No, don’t bother him. The Old Man will let us know when he is ready,” said
another.


Inside the house, a man stood hunched over a table, studying a map by
candlelight. He was not a very old man—just 56 years old—but constant
war and worries had brought new wrinkles to his face. He was **frail,** and far
thinner than he had been just two years before. But all the soldiers loved
**General** Lee as though he were their own father. They called him “The Old
Man” out of respect. ~~_A_~~ ~~general~~ ~~_is a military officer in charge of soldiers._~~
~~_General Lee was in charge of the Confederate Army._~~


**Show Image 9A-3: Lee Family Home**


General Lee’s full name was Robert E. Lee.
General Lee was born in 1807. He was the son
of a hero from the Revolutionary War who had
fought bravely alongside George Washington
to make America free from Great Britain.


Robert E. Lee joined the army at age 17 and
graduated second in his class from the United States Military Academy. ~~_He_~~
~~_had the second-highest scores in his class, which means he did very well in_~~
~~_school._~~ Then Lee served in the U.S. Army during the Mexican-American War.


Lee was proud to serve in the U.S. Army before the Civil War, but he was
born and raised in Virginia, a Confederate state. ~~[Point to Virginia on the U.S.~~
~~Map.]~~ Lee married Mary Custis, a great-granddaughter of George and Martha
Washington. After they married, Robert and Mary lived in Mary’s plantation
home known as Arlington House.


Lee did not think the South should secede from the Union. ~~_Can you recall_~~
~~_what secede means?_~~ Like many other people, he wanted to find a peaceful
way to end the disagreement, and he swore he would never break the **oath** ~~_or_~~
~~_promise_~~ he had taken to uphold the U.S. Constitution. ~~_As a soldier, he made_~~
~~_an_~~ ~~oath~~ ~~_, or promise, to do what was best for the United States._~~

Support


_Refuse_ means to say
no to.



**Show Image 9A-4: Jefferson Davis’s Cabinet**
**with Lee**


At first, Lee refused to join the Confederate
Army when President Jefferson Davis asked
him to take command. ~~_Remember, Jefferson_~~
~~_Davis was elected president of the Confederacy._~~
~~_He is the man in the image who is seated with_~~
~~_a paper in his hand._~~ Then, just before the
Battle of Fort Sumter, President Lincoln asked Lee if he would agree to take
command of the entire Union Army. Lee refused that offer, as well. ~~_Why do you_~~
~~_think General Lee refused both offers?_~~ Only when his home state of Virginia
decided to secede and join the Confederacy did Lee finally make up his mind.


He hated the thought of fighting against the United States, but he hated the
thought of fighting against his home state of Virginia even more.


General Lee became Commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, making him
one of the most powerful and recognizable figures in the Confederate Army. This
image shows Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his closest **advisors**,
including General Lee in the middle, discussing their war plan. ~~[Point out Jefferson~~
~~Davis and Robert E. Lee.] Advisors~~ ~~_are people who give suggestions or guidance to_~~
~~_someone._~~ Thanks in large part to General Lee’s excellent abilities as a general, he
commanded the Confederate Army to many victories in major battles on the field
before Gettysburg. But still, there was no end to the war in sight.


**Show Image 9A-5: Lee Telling Venable His**
**Plan**


There was a knock on General Lee’s door
in Gettysburg. It was Major Venable, Lee’s
trusted friend and aide, ~~_or helper_~~ . “General,
I have reports from your field commanders,”
said Major Venable.


“Go ahead,” he said, turning his attention back to the maps on the table.


“General Ewell had trouble organizing his men, sir, and General Rodes failed to
attack as ordered. General Early tried, but he gave up as darkness approached.”


Lee tapped his knuckles on the table and stared at the maps. There had been
nothing but bad news all day. After two days of fighting, the Union Army held
the high ground, its soldiers and cannons spread in a tight line atop a long ridge,
refusing to budge. The Union Army was on higher ground than the Confederate
Army, so they had a better position and ability to see. “I have made my decision,”



Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**148**


Lee said. “We will strike at the heart of the Union line, at Cemetery Ridge, and
divide their forces. Then the rest of our army will attack on the left and right.”


**Show Image 9A-6: Lee Greeting His Soldiers**


In the morning, The Old Man rode out to greet
his soldiers.


The men cheered and waved their hats
whenever Lee rode past, and he waved and
smiled confidently, doing his best to keep their
spirits high. ~~_How did the soldiers feel about Lee_~~
~~_if they cheered and waved their hats?_~~ Later that morning, though, things did
not go exactly according to Lee’s plans. The Confederate forces attacked,
hoping to break through the Union lines and send the enemy retreating from
the field. Lee knew that if he succeeded, the South would have a chance to
win the war. If he lost it may not. ~~_What do you think is going to happen?_~~


**Show Image 9A-7: Pickett’s Charge**


The battle went on all day, but the most
important moment came when Lee ordered
General Pickett to lead his men in a daring
charge across a wide, open field directly at the
middle of the Union lines. The move, known as
Pickett’s Charge, was a catastrophe for the
Confederates. ~~_A catastrophe is an event that_~~
~~_causes great trouble or destruction. This means that Pickett’s Charge caused_~~
~~_a great deal of trouble for the Confederate side._~~ Despite Pickett and his men’s
efforts, at the end of that third day, the Union still held the high ground. Lee
had lost the battle and had to retreat to Virginia, abandoning hopes of
invading deep into the North.


**Show Image 9A-8: Woman Mourning**


The day after the battle was the Fourth of July,
a day when Americans normally celebrate
their independence. ~~_From what country did_~~
~~_Americans gain independence? (Great Britain)_~~
In 1863, however, celebrations were not so
cheerful. Even in the North, where word
quickly spread that the Union had won a
major battle at Gettysburg, a war-torn nation was exhausted from battle. In
the three days of the battle at Gettysburg, many, many men had died, were
injured, or had been captured on both the Union and Confederate sides. Few
people on either side found a reason to celebrate.

**Show Image 9A-9: Lincoln at Gettysburg**


A few months after the battle, President Lincoln
went to Gettysburg to deliver a 2-minute-long
speech. It is known as the Gettysburg Address
and, even though it is short, it is one of the
most powerful speeches in history. Lincoln’s
Gettysburg Address reminded people what the
Union was fighting for: the survival of a nation
built on liberty and equality ~~_or freedom and fairness._~~


Here’s some of what he said: “Our fathers brought forth, upon this continent,
a new nation, conceived ~~_or created_~~ in Liberty, and dedicated to the
proposition ~~_or idea_~~ that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in ~~_or_~~
~~_in the middle of_~~ a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so
conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure ~~_or last_~~ . … [T]his nation, under
God, shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people,
by the people, for the people, shall not perish ~~_or die_~~ from the earth.”


As Lincoln saw it, America’s founding principles of liberty and equality were
being put to the test. And they were worth fighting for. ~~_How do you think_~~
~~_President Lincoln’s speech might affect the outcome of the war?_~~

Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**150**


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** How did Robert E. Lee become the commander of the Confederate

Army?


» At first, he refused to join the Confederate Army, but he also refused

President Lincoln’s offer to take command of the Union Army. Because
he was from Virginia, he agreed to take command of the Confederate
Army only after that state seceded from the Union.


2. **Literal.** How did Confederate soldiers feel about General Lee?


» They loved and respected him.


3. **Literal.** Why did General Lee refuse at first to command the Confederate

Army?


» He did not agree with the Southern states seceding from the

United States.


   - Why did he change his mind?


» When his own state of Virginia seceded, he decided he would rather

fight with Virginia than against it.


4. **Inferential.** _Think-Pair-Share_ : What do you think President Lincoln meant

by “[T]his nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that
government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from
the earth”?


» Answers may vary, but students might identify that Lincoln was

thinking about the abolishment of slavery when he says the nation will
have “a new birth of freedom,” or that he believes the end of slavery and
the war will make the government stronger so it “shall not perish from
the earth.”


5. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ What does the author most likely want the

reader to learn about General Lee?


» Answers may vary but could include that his soldiers respected him, he

was a good student in school, at first he refused to lead the Confederate
or Union armies, he was proud to serve in the army, he was a powerful
and recognizable figure, etc.


6. **Inferential.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ Why do you think that at this point in the war,

“few people on either side found reason to celebrate”?


» Students will likely point out that the amount of death and destruction

affected both sides and that the war was taking longer than expected
without achieving their goals.

~~_to hear who will help improve the care given to injured soldiers._~~





As horrible as it is, times of war can sometimes bring out the best in people.
Some individuals choose to fight not to destroy other armies, but to save
lives. Clara Barton was one such person. She wished to reduce the suffering
and pain of others. She was a schoolteacher from Massachusetts ~~[Display~~
~~the U.S. Map, and point to Massachusetts.]~~ who had always been known as a
loving, **compassionate** person. This means that she cared for other people

and wanted to make their lives better. ~~_What does_~~ ~~compassionate~~ ~~_mean?_~~
Clara Barton had no formal schooling as a medical nurse. By the end of the
war, however, she would become one of the most famous nurses in history.


Clara Barton was in Washington, D.C. after the First Battle of Manassas.

~~[Have a student point to Washington, D.C. on the U.S. Map.]~~ Hundreds
of **wounded** or ~~_injured_~~ Union soldiers returned there after losing a battle
that everyone thought they would win. The hospitals in the city were
overcrowded. There were not enough beds or medical supplies to care for the
injured soldiers. Clara Barton immediately went around the city collecting
bandages and medicine from people’s homes.


**Show Image 10A-2: Clara Barton Advocating**
**for Better Medical Care**



Clara Barton helped to care for and save
hundreds of wounded soldiers after the First
Battle of Manassas. During this time, she

and politicians were busy figuring out how to
build their armies and win battles. Nobody had thought seriously about how
to take care of the thousands of men who would get hurt in battle. ~~_Do you_~~
~~_think this was fair to the soldiers?_~~ So, Clara Barton decided she would do
something about it herself.





She began by writing letters and visiting doctors, politicians, and other
leaders. She encouraged them to spend more money on medical supplies for
the soldiers. She visited women’s groups, churches, and hospitals. She called
on wealthy individuals to donate ~~_or give_~~ medical supplies and money. Soon,
Clara Barton had collected a large assortment of supplies, but the supplies
needed to be delivered to the battlefield to be of any use. So, she continued
to look for solutions. ~~_What do you think Clara Barton is going to do?_~~


**Show Image 10A-3: Injured Soldiers**


Those who were wounded in battle
experienced terrible suffering. ~~_Look at this_~~
~~_picture. Who in this image were wounded?_~~
They were often left lying on the field for an

come and carry them away. Field hospitals
are where the wounded were taken during and after battles. They were
sometimes set up in nearby barns or houses. Sometimes, they were set up in
a group of tattered tents.





Lesson 10 Clara Barton
**163**


Soldiers in overcrowded field hospitals often found themselves alone. They
were hurt with nobody to bring them food or water. They had nobody to
comfort them and ease their pain. The doctors were simply too busy and too
tired to help everyone. Thousands of men died. They could have lived if the
hospitals had the supplies they needed.


**Show Image 10A-4: Barton Following Army**
**with Her Supplies**





Clara Barton started following the main Union
Army wherever it went. This army protected
Washington, D.C. Its ultimate goal was to
attack Richmond, the Confederate capital,
and win the war. ~~_In which state is Richmond_~~
~~_located?_~~



Challenge


Have students explain
why capturing an army’s
capital would help that
side win a war.



She took wagon loads of bandages and other supplies to field hospitals. Clara
Barton also **ensured** the doctors had what they needed. She made food
for the sick and wounded whenever possible. She also brought them water
and blankets. Clara Barton comforted them and wiped the sweat from their
foreheads. Many times she fixed their bandages and simply talked to them.


Clara Barton was determined to do even more. She wanted to be able to help
soldiers on the battlefield, who often had to wait a long time to be moved
to a hospital. Unfortunately, women were not allowed on the battlefields. At
least, that is what the generals told her whenever she asked to help during
the battles. ~~_Why do you think women were not allowed on the battlefields?_~~
But Clara Barton kept asking and insisting. Finally, in 1862, she received
permission to go to the heart of the battles.


**Show Image 10A-5: Clara Barton Caring for**
**Wounded on Battlefield**


Clara Barton became known as the “Angel of
the Battlefield.” In the middle of the **chaos** of
war, soldiers and doctors were always glad to
see her calm face. ~~_What does_~~ ~~chaos~~ ~~_mean?_~~ At
the Battle of Antietam, more than 12,000 Union
soldiers were wounded. This was far more than
she and the other nurses and doctors could care for. But they did their best.
Once a battle was over, she would hurry back to Washington, D.C. Clara Barton
would collect more supplies and then catch up with the army again.





Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**164**


**Show Image 10A-6: Army Ambulances**



By the middle of 1863, the Union Army figured
out how to make sure the field hospitals
had enough supplies. This was partly thanks
to Clara Barton. She kept pressure on ~~_or_~~
~~_continued to ask for help from_~~ the War

D.C., to make real changes. She no longer had
to collect supplies, but she continued to follow the army for the remainder of
the war. She acted as the “Angel of the Battlefield” to **countless** —more than
can be counted—wounded soldiers.





Clara Barton saw a lot of bloodshed and fighting. She was at some of the
worst battles. She worked as bullets and cannonballs whistled overhead and
crashed all around. Once, a bullet tore right through her shirt sleeve. But she
was very brave. She did not let fear stop her from doing what she needed to
do. ~~_How do you think Clara felt during those times?_~~


**Show Image 10A-7: Barton Overseas**


When the war ended, Clara Barton continued
to find ways to help others. In fact, she was
only just beginning. She went to Europe and
worked as a nurse in wars there. ~~[Display~~
~~the Global Map, and point to the continent of~~

~~the map as they are mentioned.]~~ During her
life, she worked in Turkey, China, Cuba, and other countries. She returned to
America and, in 1881, started the American Red Cross.

Today, the American Red Cross is still run by
**volunteers** . These are people who donate

Clara Barton helped countless people during
her lifetime.





There are still wars and other disasters in

was half as many as the
Union Army.





The Union Army was commanded by Ulysses S. Grant. ~~[Point to Grant in the~~
~~image.]~~ He was no stranger to battle. He had served in the army for over 25
years, starting when he was just 17 years old. ~~_This was just like Robert E. Lee._~~
The Civil War was not his first war, either. Like Confederate General Robert E.
Lee, General Grant had fought in another war.

Explain the roles of
Ulysses S. Grant and
Robert E. Lee as leaders
of the Union and
Confederate armies
to the students. Help
them understand how
their battle experiences
shaped their leadership.



General Ulysses S. Grant leaned against a post outside his tent. ~~_The word_~~
~~post~~ ~~_in this sentence means a piece of wood or metal that is set into the_~~
~~_ground in an upright position._~~


He wearily ~~_or with tiredness_~~ watched as a long line of supply wagons carrying
ammunition, food, and medical supplies rumbled past. ~~_The word_~~ ~~ammunition~~
~~_refers to the bullets, cannonballs, etc. that are shot out of weapons._~~ These supply
wagons made up the rear of the army. The main body of the army, the soldiers
who needed all those supplies in order to fight, were miles ahead, deep in the
forest, looking for the enemy. ~~_Who was the enemy of the Union Army?_~~


**Show Image 11A-2: Lincoln Gives Grant**
**Orders**


General Grant was now the general in charge
of the entire Union Army. The only person
who ranked higher than General Grant was
President Abraham Lincoln. ~~[Point out Lincoln~~

from Lincoln, and everyone else took their
orders from Grant. ~~_What title does the president have as the highest-ranking_~~
~~_commander? (commander in chief)_~~ Even though the President was in charge
and had the final say, Lincoln and Grant worked well together, trusted each
other, and grew to greatly respect one another.





They also had a lot in common. Both were very dedicated to their families,
they had strong moral character, they didn’t curse, they didn’t care about
appearances, and they loved animals. They also had similar experiences
as kids growing up in the Midwest. ~~[Display the U.S. Map, and point to the~~
~~Midwest region, highlighting Lincoln’s home state of Illinois and Grant’s~~
~~home state of Ohio.]~~ But what really made them alike was their mutual
understanding that war was dangerous and hard.


All throughout the Civil War, Lincoln and Grant were willing to do whatever it
took to win, and they were not going to give up.


Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**176**


**Show Image 11A-3: Grant Out West**


Every general in the war faced hard choices
and had heavy responsibilities, with the lives
of thousands of soldiers in his hands. But
in 1864, no general had more worries than
General Grant. ~~_Why do you think General Grant_~~
~~_had so many worries?_~~



General Grant had spent the first three years of the Civil War fighting farther
west, away from the action in Virginia. His most impressive victory in the
early years of the war came at Vicksburg, a city in Mississippi. ~~[Display and~~
~~point to Mississippi on the U.S. Map. Point to the Mississippi River as you~~
~~mention it.]~~


The same day that the Union Army had won the Battle of Gettysburg,
General Grant won the Battle of Vicksburg, after two long, hard months. The
victory gave the Union final control over the entire Mississippi River, which
in turn would make it easier for the Union to take over the rest of the South.
The Mississippi River was important because the Union could use it to send
troops and supplies from the North to the South. It was easier to use a river
to do this because there were no cars or trucks yet, and so there were no
highways like we have today.


**Show Image 11A-4: Well-Supplied**
**Northern Army/Ragged Southern Army**



Challenge


Have students think back
to what they learned in
Unit 4, _The War of 1812_ .
Ask them to describe
the importance of the
Mississippi River during
the War of 1812. (The river
was one of the targets of
the British, who helped to
control the waterways and
the Americans’ resupply
routes.)





To win the Civil War, the Union needed to take
control of the South, including all of its cities
and roads. In the beginning, nobody in the
North expected this to be so difficult.



Factories in the North had been working day
and night for years, producing weapons, uniforms, blankets, food **rations**,
wagons, and all of the other things the army needed. ~~Rations~~ ~~_are amounts_~~
~~_of food and other materials set aside for each person. Was all this production_~~
~~_from factories good for the Northern economy?_~~ The **Yankees**, as the Union
soldiers were nicknamed, had everything they needed to fight and win the
war. What was the nickname for the Union soldiers? ~~_What was the nickname_~~
~~_for Confederate soldiers? (Rebels) Why do you think the North expected to_~~
~~_win so easily?_~~


Lesson 11 Ulysses S. Grant
**177**


The Confederates, or Rebels as they were often called, did not have as many
men as the Union. The South did not have many factories; many of those it
did have were destroyed or captured by 1864. Confederate soldiers marched
to battle without shoes, without enough food, and sometimes without
enough ammunition. ~~_What is ammunition?_~~ Yet, even though they were
exhausted and starved, the Confederates somehow held on and managed to
keep fighting.


**Show Image 11A-5: General Grant**



Grant was not the general in chief of the Union
Army ~~_or commander of all of the U.S. armies_~~
at the beginning of the Civil War. Throughout
the war, President Lincoln had trouble with
some of his top Union generals. It wasn’t that
they were bad generals; they could win battles
and capture enemy forts and towns. But
they made mistakes, as well. They often waited too long to attack or failed
to chase the Confederates when they were on the run. Basically, President
Lincoln felt the Union generals were never aggressive, or forceful, enough.
Also, they were quick to blame President Lincoln when they lost battles,
rather than take responsibility for their failures.





But Grant was different. General Grant won the long Battle of Vicksburg
because he was stubborn and fearless; he kept fighting and attacking until
the enemy surrendered _or gave up._ ~~_What do you think_~~ ~~stubborn~~ ~~_means?_~~
President Lincoln put General Grant in charge of the entire Union Army
because General Grant promised that he would do whatever it took to
win; he would chase General Robert E. Lee and his army all over Virginia,
and he would not stop until the war was finished. He earned the nickname
“Unconditional Surrender” because he would accept nothing less from the
Confederate Army than a complete surrender. ~~_Do you think General Grant_~~
~~_will be able to get the Confederate Army to completely surrender?_~~

**Show Image 11A-6: Grant Reading Letter**
**from Lincoln**


President Lincoln sent a letter to General Grant.
It did not have any important information or
new orders. It was just a simple letter sent to
wish him good luck in battle. The letter was
written in the president’s handwriting:



_Lieutenant-General Grant—_


_Not expecting to see you again before you march into Virginia, I wish to tell_
_you that I am entirely satisfied with what you have done up to this time . . . You_
_are alert and self-reliant; and, pleased with this, I do not wish to control your_
_actions in any way . . . If there is anything wanting which is within my power to_
_give, do not fail to let me know it._


_And now with a brave Army, and a just cause, may God sustain you_ .


_Yours very truly,_


_A. LINCOLN_


~~_[Re-read portions to support comprehension. “I am entirely satisfied” – I am_~~
~~_happy with your performance. “If there is anything wanting” – If you need_~~
~~_anything. “a just cause” – we are fighting to ensure freedom for our fellow_~~
~~_Americans, and it is the right thing to do.]_~~

alert and self-reliant using
the context of the reading
and their prior knowledge.


Support


Review the definition of
the word _clash_, which
students learned in an
earlier lesson.





The next day, May 5, in the forests near
Fredericksburg, Virginia, Grant’s army clashed
with General Lee’s army in one of the most
chaotic battles of the war. ~~[Point to Virginia on~~
~~the U.S. Map.]~~



In those days, armies always preferred to fight in open fields, where it was
easier to move cannons and large groups of men, and easier for generals
to see what was happening. This time, though, the armies met deep in the
woods, where the tree and plant growth were so heavy that the soldiers
could barely see one another.


Lesson 11 Ulysses S. Grant
**179**


Challenge


Have students define the

word _chaotic_ based on
the way it is used in this

paragraph.



This was called the Battle of the Wilderness, and it was the very first time
Generals Grant and Lee faced each other in battle. It was a very chaotic
battle. Thousands were killed and wounded. At the end of the day, both
armies limped away ~~_or left with difficulty because of their injuries_~~, with no
clear winner in the battle.


**Show Image 11A-8: Clara Barton Tending**
**Wounded**



After the battle, many of the Union wounded
were taken to churches and homes in the
nearby city of Fredericksburg. Clara Barton

to wounded soldiers. ~~_Who was Clara Barton?_~~
~~_What was her nickname?_~~ The next day,
hundreds more wounded soldiers were brought in from yet another battle.
And on it went.





The armies of Grant and Lee met again and again during the months that
followed. Sometimes Grant won the battle, sometimes Lee won, and sometimes
nobody won. But with each battle, the Confederate Army got a little smaller and
that much closer to final **defeat.** ~~_The word_~~ ~~defeat~~ ~~_means a failure to win. Does_~~
~~_this last sentence give you a clue about who will win the war?_~~

of Vicksburg because he was stubborn and unafraid. How might being
stubborn and unafraid help someone win a battle in a war?


» Answers may vary, but students may identify that these qualities could

make sure someone was so committed to winning the battle that they
would not back down, no matter how dangerous or scary.

**With a Partner:** On a piece of paper, take turns with your partner writing
the ways the Confederate Army (or Rebels) was similar to the Union Army
(or the Yankees). Then, take turns writing the ways the Confederate Army
was different from the Union Army.


[Have several students share responses with the class.]


» Answers may vary but may include for similarities that they were

both intent on winning and that they were both led by strong

leaders. Answers for differences may include that the Union Army

had more soldiers, ammunition, food, and supplies. The Union

also had factories to produce supplies for the Union Army. The

Confederate Army’s soldiers marched to battle without shoes,

without enough food, and sometimes without enough ammunition.


**Evaluative** . _Think-Pair-Share_ : Do you think these differences eventually
led to the defeat of the Confederate Army? How do you know?


» Answers may vary but should reflect information in the text,

including the fact that an army that has better supplies, such as

ammunition and food, can survive battles better, and that factories

could produce the things an army needs, such as weapons,

uniforms, blankets, and wagons.

~~**“THE END OF SLAVERY IN THE UNITED STATES” (10 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 12A-1: U.S. Capitol**


After years of fighting, the Civil War
was nearing an end. The Emancipation
Proclamation in 1863 brought the United
States one step closer to ending slavery.



Emancipation Proclamation would still be in
effect after the war ended. Lincoln knew that the Emancipation Proclamation
was only a **temporary** ~~_or short-term_~~ solution. A **permanent** ~~_or long-lasting_~~
solution was needed to end slavery in America.

Support


Explain the three
branches of government
and the Constitutional
idea of checks and
balances to support
student understanding
of why the Emancipation
Proclamation was only a
temporary solution until
Congress voted for the end
of slavery.





America has three branches of government. In simple terms, these branches
include the president, the lawmakers, and the judges. Each branch has certain jobs and responsibilities, and no individual branch can have more power
than the others. So, even though he was the president, Lincoln had done
all he could. The president is not a king. ~~_Why did the Founding Fathers think_~~

**191**


~~_it was important to create a system of government where one person_~~ ~~(the~~
~~president)~~ ~~_doesn’t have all the power?_~~ ~~(They fought the Revolutionary War to~~
~~establish a new type of government.)~~ The president only has certain powers
given to him or her by the American people; these powers are outlined ~~_or_~~
~~_explained_~~ in the Constitution. The responsibility to find a permanent solution
fell to the lawmakers in Congress.


**Show Image 12A-2: U.S. Constitution**


An **amendment** is a change or an update to
the U.S. Constitution. The amendment that
would end slavery in the United States was
the 13th Amendment. But a lot of people in
Congress had to agree on it first. For the 13th

most of the lawmakers in Congress would have
to vote for it. Once that happened, it would have to be **ratified** (or accepted)
by the states.





The language of the 13th Amendment had been debated many times during
the Civil War. Yet even after many debates and discussions, the members
of Congress couldn’t reach an agreement. ~~_Why do you think reaching an_~~
~~_agreement on the 13th_~~ ~~Amendment~~ ~~_was so difficult?_~~


There was a real possibility that the **elimination** ~~_or removal_~~ of slavery would
not happen, even though thousands had given their lives fighting for this
cause. But something changed when Abraham Lincoln was elected president
for the second time in 1864. Lincoln’s re-election sent a clear message
that the American people wanted slavery to go away. ~~_Why did re-electing_~~
~~_President Lincoln send a clear message that the American people wanted_~~
~~_slavery to go away? (President Lincoln supported the abolishment of slavery.)_~~


Lincoln had to work very hard to help convince members of Congress to pass
the 13th Amendment, but he would be successful. On January 31, 1865, the
13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, was passed.


There were still millions of slaves outside of the United States. In the islands
of the Caribbean and South America, slaves continued to work on large sugar
plantations in brutal ~~_or terrible_~~ conditions. People continued to be enslaved
in many nations in Asia, Africa, and Europe. But in the United States, slavery
had finally been eliminated.


Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**192**


**Show Image 12A-3: Richmond**


Not long after, in the spring of 1865, the Civil
War was finally coming to a close.



On April 1 and 2 of that year, General Ulysses
S. Grant and Union troops won major victories
in Virginia. Here, they cut off the Confederate
supply lines ~~_or stopped the Confederates_~~
~~_from receiving important shipments of items like food, medicine, and_~~
~~_weapons, which they needed to be successful._~~ General Robert E. Lee and his
Confederate troops were forced to abandon the city of Richmond, Virginia,
which was the capital of the Confederacy. ~~[Display the U.S. Map, and point~~
~~out Virginia. Then direct students’ attention to the image of Richmond in~~
~~ruins.]~~





For the next week, Lee and his army retreated ~~_or pulled back to escape a_~~
~~_battle._~~ They were trying to find desperately needed food and supplies while
avoiding the Union Army. Lee’s Confederate soldiers were hungry, tired, and
weary. Some didn’t follow instructions and went searching for food.


**Show Image 12A-4: Appomattox**
**Surrender**



Defeat of the Confederate Army was all but
certain. Grant sent Lee a letter on April 7,
1865, asking Lee to surrender. Lee refused.
Lee thought that he just needed to make it to a
place called Appomattox before Grant’s troops
did. Then, he could resupply his army.



Support


Use a map of Virginia to
demonstrate the distance
between Richmond and
Appomattox.


Challenge


Invite students to discuss
why Appomattox is often
considered the end of the
war, even though it took
months for the rest of
the Confederate forces to
surrender.





But, the Union troops took shorter roads and arrived at Appomattox first.
Now, Lee’s army was trapped and couldn’t escape. Rather than risk the lives
of his weary men, Lee’s only choice was to surrender. On April 9, General
Robert E. Lee and his 28,000 Confederate troops surrendered to General
Grant in Appomattox, Virginia. ~~[Point out General Lee and General Grant in~~
~~the image, depicting the surrender.]~~


It would take many months for the rest of the Confederate forces to
surrender. But the Confederate capital and highest-ranking Confederate
general had been defeated. The surrender at Appomattox was so important
that many people think of it as the end of the war.



Lesson 12 The End of Slavery in the United States
**193**


**Show Image 12A-5: President Lincoln**


After four years and hundreds of thousands
of lives, the Civil War preserved the Union. It
prevented the “house divided” that Abraham
Lincoln had talked about from breaking apart
forever. It brought slavery to an end but at
great cost.



Many people played a role, but none as big as Lincoln. The war had aged him
like it did Lee. He wanted what was best for millions of people and it was a
heavy burden. ~~_Why do you think the war aged Lincoln?_~~ Through it all, Lincoln
stayed true to his moral beliefs informed by the Christian Bible, that he was
a humble servant who made mistakes like any man. ~~_What does it mean to be_~~
~~_humble?_~~


Lincoln once said, “I know that the Lord is always on the side of the right. But
it is my constant anxiety and prayer that I and this nation should be on the
Lord’s side.” As the war progressed, Lincoln believed that God wanted slavery
to end. He believed God wanted to use the Union to make it happen. Lincoln’s
determination, bravery, and leadership led to the end of slavery. ~~_How do you_~~
~~_think Lincoln showed determination to end slavery?_~~ ~~T~~ he Civil War was won by
the Union in 1865.


Former slaves were free and the Union remained intact. Our great nation
survived. After enduring years of loss and devastation, Americans looked
toward a hopeful future.


**Show Image 12A-6: John Wilkes Booth**
**Flees After Attacking President Lincoln**





But on the night of April 14, just five days after
Lee surrendered to Grant, tragedy struck
again. That evening, President Abraham
Lincoln went to watch a play at Ford’s Theater
in Washington, D.C.



Not everyone was happy that the Union emerged victorious ~~_or won_~~ the
Civil War. This included an actor, John Wilkes Booth. He wanted to save the
Confederacy. So, Booth and a group of helpers hatched ~~_or came up with_~~ a
plan to get rid of Lincoln.


During the show, Lincoln was in a cheerful mood. He laughed during the
performance while seated in a private box ~~_or a small separate seating area_~~
~~_for audience members in a theater_~~ with his wife and friends.


Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**194**


As the show continued, Booth snuck into Lincoln’s box. He attacked the
president of the United States. ~~[Point out Lincoln’s private box in the~~
~~illustration, along with Booth running away across the stage.]~~ Lincoln was
carried across the street to a boarding house. The surgeon general ~~_or a high-_~~
~~_ranking doctor appointed by the president_~~ arrived to help, but Lincoln would
not survive. The next morning, President Lincoln died, surrounded by his wife
and several of his loved ones.


**Show Image 12A-7: Walt Whitman**



Americans across the country mourned ~~_or_~~
~~_expressed deep sadness about_~~ the death of
their heroic leader. They remembered Lincoln
who bravely led the United States through the
devastating Civil War. As part of a long funeral,

in Illinois. ~~[Point out Illinois on the U.S. Map.]~~
~~_Why would Lincoln’s final resting place be in Illinois? (He was from Illinois.)_~~
Tens of thousands of Americans stood beside the railroad tracks. They
gathered to show respect for the fallen president.





This devastating tragedy inspired the poet Walt Whitman ~~[Point to the~~
~~illustration of Walt Whitman]~~ to write many poems that honor Lincoln’s life,
legacy, and impact. Like Lincoln, Whitman came from humble beginnings.
Whitman recognized the immense ~~_or huge_~~ burden that Lincoln carried to
save the Union.


Whitman spent time writing poems to remember Lincoln’s life and memory.
Published in the Saturday Press on November 4, 1865, “O Captain! My
Captain!” became one of Whitman’s most famous poems.


The poem reflects the mixed emotions of Americans at the time of Lincoln’s
death. The Union had endured a devastating ~~_or deeply upsetting_~~ conflict,
won the Civil War, and ended slavery. There was much to celebrate. There
was also much to mourn. ~~_Can you recall what_~~ ~~mourn~~ ~~_means?_~~ Not only was
Lincoln gone, but many Americans had lost loved ones in the Civil War.


“O Captain! My Captain!” captures these contrasting feelings of sadness and
joy, despair and relief.


The poem clearly struck a chord ~~_or affected emotions_~~ within the hearts of the
American people. It honored the contributions of Lincoln. It also expressed the
confusing emotions that Americans were feeling after the Civil War ended. But
the sacrifices of those who led, fought, contributed, and experienced hardship

and loss will always be remembered. This is why we learn about the Civil War—
because of the contributions of all of these people that we have learned about.
People like President Lincoln, Harriet Tubman, General Grant, Clara Barton,
and Frederick Douglass helped make sure that slavery ended in America.
Today, every man, woman, and child, no matter the color of their skin, can live
a life of freedom, equality, and liberty in the United States.


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** Who played the biggest role in the successful end of the Civil War and

the elimination of slavery in the United States?


» President Lincoln


2. **Inferential.** Why did the end of the Civil War cause Americans to look toward

a hopeful future?


» The end of the war meant that slavery was abolished in the country, and

the Confederate states were brought back into the Union to begin the
process of moving toward a unified and stronger country.


3. **Inferential.** In the Read-Aloud, you heard that Walt Whitman recognized the

huge burden that President Lincoln carried to save the Union; what was the
burden he carried?


» President Lincoln had to go to war against the Confederacy and

sacrifice hundreds of thousands of lives to end slavery and reunite the
nation.


4. **Inferential.** Why would Whitman refer to President Lincoln as a “captain” in

his poem “O Captain! My Captain!”?


» Whitman may have referred to President Lincoln as a captain because

he was a respected leader in charge of “steering the ship” during the
Civil War, much like a captain.


5. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ In the poem “O Captain! My Captain!,” Walt

Whitman says that even though the “captain” has died, “the prize we [looked
for] is won.” What “prize” do you think he is talking about?


» Answers may vary, but students will likely identify possible “prizes” as

the abolishment of slavery, the end of the violence, or the reunification
of the country.

to change or improve, and it can be used when someone makes a change
or correction to anything, not just an official document. I am going to read
several sentences. If the person has decided to change or correct something,
say, “_____ amended something.” If the person does not change or update
something, say, “_____ did not amend something.”

                 - Have students pretend that they were at one of the important events during
the Civil War. Ask students to describe what they saw and heard. For example,
for the reading of the Emancipation Proclamation, students may talk about
seeing the soldier, the scroll, etc. They may talk about hearing people
cheering, clapping, etc. Consider also extending this activity by adding group
or independent writing opportunities associated with the “You Were There”
concept. For example, ask students to pretend they are newspaper reporters
describing the surrender at Appomattox Court House and write a group news
article describing the event.

Materials: Drawing paper, drawing tools


                 - Tell the class or a group of students that they are going to make a class book
to help them remember what they have learned in this unit. Have students
brainstorm important information about the Civil War, Robert E. Lee, Clara
Barton, the Emancipation Proclamation, Ulysses S. Grant, and Abraham
Lincoln. Have each student choose one idea to draw a picture of and then
write a caption for the picture. Bind the pages to make a book to put in the
class library for students to review.


**Using a Map**

                 - Use the Global Map to review different global locations mentioned in the
Read-Alouds. Ask questions such as the following:

_Central and South America)_


                        - Where did Clara Barton work as a nurse outside of the United States, before
returning to start the American Red Cross? _(Europe, Turkey, China, Cuba)_


                 - Use the U.S. Map to review various U.S. locations from the Read-Alouds. Ask
questions such as the following:

    - The bombardment of Fort Sumter near Charleston, South Carolina,

marked the beginning of the Civil War. Can anyone find South Carolina on
the map? Was South Carolina part of the North or the South? _(the South)_


    - General Lee surrendered to General Grant at the village of Appomattox

Court House, Virginia. Can anyone find Virginia on the map? Was Virginia
part of the North or the South? _(South)_


    - One of the major battles of the Civil War was at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

Can anyone find Pennsylvania on the map? Was Pennsylvania part of the
North or the South? _(the North)_


**Compare/Contrast**

  - Tell students that there are many things to compare and contrast in the
Read-Alouds they have heard so far. Remind students that to compare means
to tell how things or people are similar and to contrast is to tell how things or
people are different. Have students choose a topic from the following list to
compare/contrast on a chart. You may do this individually or as a class.


    - General Ulysses S. Grant and General Robert E. Lee


    - Harriet Tubman and Clara Barton


    - The Northern economy and the Southern economy


    - Yankees and Rebels


  - You may wish to extend this activity by using the chart as a prewriting tool
and having students write two paragraphs, one describing similarities and
the other describing differences.


**T-Chart**

  - Have students create a T-Chart, with the left column labeled “Costs” and the
right column labeled “Outcomes.” Invite them to use the T-Chart to record as
many costs and outcomes of the Civil War as they can from the Read-Alouds.


  - You may wish to extend this activity by inviting students to select one cost or
outcome to explain to the class, including who was most affected by it.

#### Culminating Activities


~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


Please use this final day to address the class results of the Unit Assessment.
Based on the results of the Unit Assessment, you may wish to use this class
time to provide remediation opportunities that target specific areas of
weakness for individual students, small groups, or the whole class.


Alternatively, you may also choose to use this class time to extend or enrich
students’ experience with unit knowledge. A number of enrichment activities
are provided below in order to provide students with opportunities to enliven
their experiences with unit concepts.


~~**REMEDIATION**~~


You may choose to regroup students according to a particular area of
weakness, as indicated from Unit Assessment results.


Remediation opportunities include the following:


                  - Targeting Review activities


                  - Revisiting lesson applications


                - Rereading and discussing select Read-Alouds


~~**ENRICHMENT**~~


**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**


Materials: Board or chart paper


                 - Give students a key unit concept or vocabulary word such as _Yankees_,
_abolitionists_, or _rebels_ . Have them brainstorm everything that comes to mind
when they hear the word, such as _North_, _Union_, etc. Record their responses
on the board or chart paper for reference.


Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**210**


**Class Book: The U.S. Civil War**


Materials: Drawing paper, drawing tools


  - Tell the class or a group of students that they are going to make a class book
to help them remember what they have learned in this unit. Have students
brainstorm important information about the Civil War, Harriet Tubman,
Robert E. Lee, Clara Barton, the Emancipation Proclamation, Abraham
Lincoln, and Ulysses S. Grant. Have each student choose one idea to draw a
picture of and then write a caption for the picture. Bind the pages to make a
book to put in the class library for students to read again and again.


**Civil War Journals**
Materials: Students’ Civil War Journals, binding materials (optional)


  - Students may share and discuss their Civil War journal entries with a partner
or with the class. You may wish to bind students’ individual journals now that
they are complete.


**Student Choice**


Materials: Unit Read-Aloud texts


  - Ask students which Read-Aloud they have heard recently that they would like
to hear again. If necessary, reread the titles of recent Read-Alouds to refresh
students’ memories. You may also want to choose one yourself.


  - Reread the selected text. Feel free to pause at different places in the ReadAloud this time and talk about vocabulary and information you did not
discuss previously during the Read-Aloud.


  - After the Read-Aloud, ask students if they noticed anything new or different
during the second reading that they did not notice during the first reading.
Also, ask them to try to express why they like this Read-Aloud. Remember
to repeat and expand upon each response using richer and more complex
language, including, if possible, any Read-Aloud vocabulary.


**Writing Prompts**


Materials: Writing paper, pencil


  - Students may be given an additional writing prompt such as the following:


    - If I could interview Harriet Tubman, I would ask her . . .


    - Clara Barton was a brave woman because . . .


    - Abraham Lincoln was a great president because . . .


    - When the Civil War ended . . .


    - If I could meet any person from Civil War times, I would want to meet . . .


Culminating Activities

**Letter to a Friend**


Materials: Writing paper, pencil


                 - Have students choose a historical figure from the texts they’ve studied and
write a letter to a friend from that person’s perspective. Encourage students
to write the letter to someone with whom they share a connection. Remind
students that these people were friendly with each other, so their letters
should reflect that warmth and familiarity.


Historical Connections:


                        - Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant


                        - Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass

**Perspective**


Materials: Writing paper, pencil


                - Have students choose a character from the Read-Alouds they have heard
so far. Tell them that they are going to write two or three sentences about
the war from that character’s perspective. Remind them that perspective is
how someone sees or experiences something. Elaborate, saying that Clara
Barton’s perspective of the Civil War would have been very different from
Confederate President Jefferson Davis’s perspective. Prompt them with
questions such as “What does your character think about the war? Is your
character involved in the war? How?”


                        - Clara Barton


                        - General Grant


                        - General Lee

                 - Allow students to share their writing with the class and ask each other
questions. Remember to expand on each student’s response using richer and
more complex language, including, if possible, any Read-Aloud vocabulary.


**Red Cross Volunteer**

                 - Invite a volunteer from the local Red Cross to come in and talk with your
class about the work that they do with the Red Cross. You may help your
students formulate questions to ask the guest speaker.


Unit 7 The U.S. Civil War
**212**


**Research Activity**

  - If any questions were left unanswered about the Northern or Southern
economies, Southern plantations, the Underground Railroad, or the evolution
of flags during the Civil War, give students the opportunity to continue their
research on these topics. Encourage students to present their findings to a
group of students or the class.


**Research Activity: Evolution of Flags During the Civil War**

  - Review the Union and the Confederacy and what caused the states that
formed the Confederacy to secede, thus causing the Civil War.


  - Review the images of the Union and Confederate flags from Lesson 6. Review
the states that are a part of the Union.


  - Likewise, review the states that seceded from the Union at different points
and how that corresponds to the number of stars on the two Confederate
flags.


  - Have students research images of the Union and Confederate flags during

the time of the Civil War and how they evolved throughout the Civil War,
including different battle flags.


  - Encourage students to share their findings in groups or as a class

presentation.


**Make a Proclamation Scroll**


Materials: Empty paper towel tubes, kraft paper or construction paper, white
glue, pencils or markers


  - Remind students that a proclamation is an official announcement, and
Abraham Lincoln wrote the Emancipation Proclamation to help end slavery.


  - Encourage students to think about a proclamation (announcement) they
would like to make to their classmates.


  - Distribute construction paper and encourage students to write their
proclamation on the paper.


  - Consider providing the following prompts for announcements:

rolls until they meet in the middle.


                   - After students have finished assembling their scrolls, encourage students to
share their proclamations with the class.


**Gallery Walk**


Materials: Image Cards, tape


                  - Tape each image card from the unit to the walls throughout the classroom.
Encourage students to walk around the classroom to observe the images.
After all students have circulated and observed the image cards, assign them
to small groups to discuss what they observed. Provide students with the
following prompts to focus their discussion:


                          - I observed . . .


                          - I recalled . . . about this image.

For kindergarten and grade<br>1, certain of these student expectations apply to text read aloud for students not yet at the stage of decoding written text. The<br>student is expected to:|
|ELPS 4.A|<br> <br> <br>learn relationships between sounds and letters of the<br>English language and decode (sound out) words using<br>a combination of skills such as recognizing sound-<br>letter relationships and identifying cognates, affixes,<br>roots, and base words||
|ELPS 4.B|<br>recognize directionality of English reading such as left<br>to right and top to bottom||
|ELPS 4.C|<br> <br> <br>develop basic sight vocabulary, derive meaning<br>of environmental print, and comprehend English<br>vocabulary and language structures used routinely in<br>written classroom materials||
|ELPS 4.D|<br> <br> <br>use prereading supports such as graphic organizers,<br>illustrations, and pretaught topic-related vocabulary<br>and other prereading activities to enhance<br>comprehension of written text||
|ELPS 4.E|<br> <br>read linguistically accommodated content area<br>material with a decreasing need for linguistic<br>accommodations as more English is learned||
|ELPS 4.F|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>use visual and contextual support and support from<br>peers and teachers to read grade-appropriate content<br>area text, enhance and confirm understanding, and<br>develop vocabulary, grasp of language structures,<br>and background knowledge needed to comprehend<br>increasingly challenging language||
|ELPS 4.G|<br> <br> <br> <br>demonstrate comprehension of increasingly complex<br>English by participating in shared reading, retelling or<br>summarizing material, responding to questions, and<br>taking notes commensurate with content area and<br>grade level needs||
|ELPS 4.H|<br>read silently with increasing ease and comprehension<br>for longer periods||
|ELPS 4.I|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>demonstrate English comprehension and expand<br>reading skills by employing basic reading skills such<br>as demonstrating understanding of supporting ideas<br>and details in text and graphic sources, summarizing<br>text, and distinguishing main ideas from details<br>commensurate with content area needs||
