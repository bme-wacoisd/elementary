**Flip Book Introduction**


This Flip Book contains images that accompany the
Teacher Guide for _Fairy Tales and Tall Tales_ . The images are
in sequential order. Each image is identified by its lesson
number, read-aloud letter (A or B), and the number of the
image within the particular read-aloud. For example, the first
image in Read-Aloud 1A is numbered 1A-1. Once you have
worked your way through the book to the last page, you will
flip the entire book over to view the second half of the images.


Depending on your classroom configuration, you may need
to have students sit closer to the Flip Book in order to see the
images clearly.
