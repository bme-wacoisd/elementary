Dear Family Member,


### 1.2 Take-Home



Over the next few days, your student will be learning about the human body systems
and their important parts—organs, tissues, and cells. They will learn about the discovery
of human cells. Below are some suggestions for home activities to reinforce your student’s
own observations and discoveries.


1. Sense Organs


Reinforce your student’s previous knowledge of the five senses by talking about the
organs responsible for each one: eyes, nose, tongue, ears, and skin. Ask your student to
tell you which organ is the largest body organ (skin).


2. Examining Objects Closely


If possible, provide your student with a magnifying glass. Encourage them to examine,
draw, and label common objects in the environment.


3. Words to Use


Below is a list of some of the words that your student will be using at school. Try to use
these words as they come up in everyday speech with your student.

     - _nutrition—_ Reading nutrition labels can help you select the right foods to eat.

     - _magnify—_ Microscopes magnify, or enlarge, microscopic organisms.

     - _stomach—_ When the digestive system is upset, your stomach may ache.

     - _vaccinations—_ Vaccinations prevent many children from getting oncecommon diseases.


4. Finding Everyday Lenses


Talk about the everyday use of lenses, and look for different kinds of lenses together:
eyeglasses, contact lenses, telescopes, microscopes, binoculars, cell phone/cameras,
digital cameras, and car headlights.

5. Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read to your student each day. The local library has
numerous books on the human body and nutrition that you may share with your student.

learned at school.

Dear Family Member,


### 5.3 Take-Home



Your student is learning about the digestive system and the excretory system, the two
body systems that process our food and help us get rid of wastes. Over the next few days
they will learn the importance of keeping bodies healthy by eating nutritional foods. Below
are some suggestions for activities that you can do at home to reinforce your student’s
learning about these important systems and the foods that supply our bodies with the
most nutrients.


1. How Long Are My Intestines?


The large and small intestines combined are about 25 feet long. Using a tape measure,
help your student find objects or measure distances that are of a similar length. This will
reinforce an incredible fact about this lengthy digestive organ!


2. A Fact-Finding Trip to the Grocery Store


Spend additional time in the produce section during a regular visit to the grocery store.
Ask your student to find a fruit or vegetable that is unfamiliar to them. Identify the item, and,
if it is not too expensive, buy one to try. Find out more about its origins and nutritional value
by looking it up in a book or online. Another fun and informative grocery store activity for you
and your student is to read package labels, making healthy meal selections based on good
nutritional content—those foods that are low in sodium, sugars, and fats.


3. Words to Use


Your student has learned technical terms for discussing the body. Try to use these
words as they come up in everyday speech with your student.

     - _excrete—_ One way our bodies excrete, or get rid of, waste is through our skin.

     - _digest—_ It is important to eat slowly in order to digest our food well.

     - _perspire/perspiration—_ I perspire, or sweat, on a hot day.

     - _urine/urination—_ Urine is made up largely of water.


4. Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read to your student each day. The local library has
numerous books on nutrition that you may share with your student.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they have
learned at school.
