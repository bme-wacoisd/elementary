**Grade-Level Teacher Edition for Each Module**


The **Teacher Edition** is the primary teacher-facing resource and includes
complete daily lesson plans, lesson facilitation guidance and pacing, and
educative resources for teachers. Components include the following:


             - **Module Overview:** Summarizes the development of student learning
throughout each topic of the module, as well as helps teachers understand
the module’s placement in the overall development of learning in and
across grades. Includes the objectives table, terminology, identification of
common misconceptions, instructional support for those misconceptions,
and materials and representations.

             - **Topic Overview:** Includes the focus standards, the number of
instructional days, coherence links to previous and subsequent modules, a
summary of the development of learning, and teacher-facing objectives.
Lessons are provided within each topic.

  - **Answer Keys:** Includes the answers for Sprints (if applicable), Problem Sets, Exit Tickets, and
Homework.


**Grade-Level Assessments**


An **Assessment** resource is provided for each grade level, including the Mid-Module Assessment Task
and the End-of-Module Assessment Task for all grade-level modules, along with exemplar responses and




scoring rubrics. The assessments provide students the opportunity to show their level of proficiency on
the TEKS addressed within the module. A Progression Toward Proficiency accompanies each assessment
and helps educators identify and celebrate what the students can already do and what they need to
work on next. For grade K, the Observational Assessments are also part of the Assessment resource.
These assessments provide a means of recording observations while students work on math tasks during
the day and serve as a tool for formative assessment.


**K–5 Math Additional Days School Year (ADSY)**


One **ADSY module** is provided for each grade level, which includes three days
reserved for flexible use (i.e., flex days) to give students an extra push with
content that needs reinforcement. Each ADSY lesson reviews a specific TEKS,
chosen strategically based on its coherence with the mathematical
understandings that span grade levels. ADSY lessons are supplemental to the
core instructional materials, and topics can be taught independently based
on students’ needs. These lessons can be used to respond to data after an
assessment.


**Student Editions for Each Module**


_Learn_
**Learn** serves as a student’s in-class companion; it’s where
they show their thinking, share what they know, and watch
their knowledge build every day. Learn assembles the daily
classwork—Application Problems, Exit Tickets, Problem Sets,
and templates—in an easily stored and navigated volume.


_Practice_
Each lesson begins with a series of energetic, joyous fluency
activities, including those found in **Practice** . Students who are
fluent in their math facts can become proficient with more
material more deeply. With Practice, students build
competence in newly acquired skills and reinforce previous
learning in preparation for the next lesson. Practice includes
Sprints and is only included for lessons that have Sprints.
Together, Learn and Practice provide students with all the
print materials that they will use for their core math
instruction.




_Succeed_
**Succeed** enables students to work individually toward
proficiency. These additional problems align lesson by lesson
with classroom instruction, making them ideal for use as
homework or extra practice. Each homework assignment is
accompanied by a Homework Helper, a set of worked
examples that illustrate how to solve similar problems.




#### **Lesson Structure and Features**
##### **Objectives**

The **Objective** states the learning goal of the lesson and
informs the major portion of instruction in the Concept
Development.

##### **Outline of Lesson Structure**


The **Lesson Structure** is comprised of four critical components that promote balanced and rigorous
instruction. A **Suggested Lesson Structure** shows the sequence and recommended time length of the
components of the lesson. These four components include the following:


**Fluency Practice:** Energizing fluency activities provide
distributed practice with previously learned material
and prepare students for new learning by activating
prior knowledge.




**Application Problem:** Application Problems are daily
problem-solving practice that either reaches back to
previous concepts as layered review or reaches back to
a previous understanding that provides a stepping
stone and/or a connection to the current day’s work.


**Concept Development:** The Concept Development is
the primary lesson component in which new learning is
introduced. Concept Development includes time
allotted for the Problem Set, an opportunity for
independent practice.


**Student Debrief:** Students engage in discussion,
reflection, and synthesis of the day’s learning, including
completion of an Exit Ticket.




##### **Homework**

Similar in content and format to the Problem Sets, the **Homework** gives
students additional practice with the skills and concepts they learn in class
each day.

##### **Assessments**


**Assessments** provide an opportunity for students to show their learning
accomplishments in addition to offering students a pathway to monitor their
progress, celebrate successes, examine mistakes, uncover misconceptions, and engage in self-reflection
and analysis. Assessments in the K–5 Math instructional materials are driven by a continuous cycle: plan,
teach, assess, and analyze. This highly effective structure provides crucial feedback to the teacher.
Teachers adjust and respond, basing their instructional choices on the evidence they gather.
Assessments include daily **formative** **assessments**, **summative assessments**, and **diagnostic tools** .


**Daily Formative**


**Problem Set:** Problem Sets are designed to move from
simple to complex problems, building on previous
knowledge in small attainable steps. Though designed
for practice, Problem Sets can also serve as formative
assessments that provide another opportunity to
monitor student learning.




**Student Debrief:** Students engage in discussion,
reflection, and synthesis of the day’s learning in the
Student Debrief.


**Exit Ticket:** Exit Tickets are brief, daily, formative
assessments that typically contain one or two problems
at a similar level of complexity as the Concept
Development.


**Kindergarten Interview and Observational**
**Assessments:** Interview-style Module Assessment Tasks
afford students the unique opportunity to showcase
what they know, can do, and can express through
multiple modalities: writing, speaking, and
demonstrating. Observational assessments are also
available as another type of assessment tool to support
ongoing, formative assessment practices as educators
monitor student proficiency of the key concepts and
skills over time. Interviewing and observing are ageappropriate means of assessment and provide a
window into the approach that the student used
(subitizing, counting all, or another strategy) to solve a
problem.




**Summative**


**Mid-Module Assessment Task:** A Mid-Module
Assessment Task is provided with most modules, along
with scoring information. These tasks are specifically
tailored to address approximately the first half of the
student learning outcomes for that module.


**End-of-Module Assessment Task:** A summative
End-of-Module Assessment Task, along with a rubric for
scoring, is also provided for each module. Tasks are
specifically designed based on the standards addressed
to gauge students’ understanding of the module as a
whole. Some items test understanding of specific TEKS,
while others are synthesis items that assess either
understanding of the broader concept addressed in the
module or the ability to solve problems by combining
knowledge, skills, and understanding.




**Diagnostic Tools**


**Fluency Practice:** Energizing fluency activities provide
distributed practice with previously learned material
and prepare students for new learning by activating
prior knowledge.


**Application Problem:** Application Problems are daily
problem-solving practice that either reaches back to
previous concepts as layered review or reaches back to
a previous understanding that provides a stepping
stone and/or a connection to the current day’s work.

##### **Digital-Only Materials**


**QTI Assessments**

**Question & Test Interoperability (QTI)** files are provided for the implementation of digital assessments
aligned to each print Mid- and End-of-Module Assessment Task. It is recommended to administer either
the print or the digital assessment method of the Mid- and End-of-Module Assessment Task. Students
should not take both assessment types. For grades 1–5, there are many problem types that students
could encounter on digital assessments: multiple-choice, multiselect, text entry/equation editor,
graphing, inline choice, hot spot, drag and drop, and fractional model. For grade K, the digital
assessments have fewer item types and are designed to be teacher-directed and delivered one-on-one
with students.
