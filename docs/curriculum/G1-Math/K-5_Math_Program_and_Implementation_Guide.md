**Introduction**


The _K–5 Math_ instructional materials are a comprehensive and clearly sequenced suite of materials that
provides teachers with the knowledge and tools outlined in the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)
and guides students to be thinkers and doers of mathematics.


One key feature of these high-quality instructional materials is the way they tell the unfolding story of
mathematics as expressed in the standards, lesson by lesson, throughout each grade. The story draws
together mathematical concepts as it emphasizes key themes: the creation and manipulation of units, and
the relationships among those units.


A second key feature is its major focus on meaningful assessment. Well-designed materials anticipate
student misconceptions and misunderstandings around content. Because assessment tools promote selfmonitoring and self-improvement, they also serve as learning devices for students and are essential for
creating effective student-teacher partnerships, as evidenced in _Visible Learning_ . [1] A teacher who may have
previously said, “I taught this standard to my students, and I hope they understand it,” can now assert,
“My students and I collaborated on this standard until they understood it. Here, let them show you their
proficiency with it.”


A third key feature is an engaging lesson structure that helps teachers lead students through fast-paced
practice, encourage perseverance, and foster thoughtful development of understanding. The four-part lesson
structure helps teachers focus their energy on engaging students in the mathematical story through the
introduction of challenging problems that call for quantitative and creative thinking. At the same time, lessons
provide problem-solving tools and models and help students identify common patterns. This is so students’
understanding of subjects, such as algebra, extends naturally from their knowledge of numbers, as the authors
of _Elementary Mathematics for Teachers_ [2] point out.


**Rooted in Cognitive and Developmental Science**


These instructional materials are built on basic scientific insights about math learning, growing out of
cognitive and developmental science. From cognitive science comes a picture of what it means to know
math and be prepared to use mathematical knowledge in the future. [3] From developmental science comes
a picture of how a classroom environment or culture can best motivate and engage the young learner’s
brain. [4]


This scientific evidence base wasn’t available when most teachers were growing up. Therefore, most teachers
encountered instructional materials based on conventional ideas. Now, however, this established science is
widely available, and the implications for math instructional materials are more fully understood.

**Introduction**



The _K–5 Math_ instructional materials are a comprehensive and clearly sequenced suite of materials that
provides teachers with the knowledge and tools outlined in the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)
and guides students to be thinkers and doers of mathematics.



One key feature of these high-quality instructional materials is the way they tell the unfolding story of
mathematics as expressed in the standards, lesson by lesson, throughout each grade. The story draws
together mathematical concepts as it emphasizes key themes: the creation and manipulation of units, and
the relationships among those units.



A second key feature is its major focus on meaningful assessment. Well-designed materials anticipate
student misconceptions and misunderstandings around content. Because assessment tools promote selfmonitoring and self-improvement, they also serve as learning devices for students and are essential for
creating effective student-teacher partnerships, as evidenced in _Visible Learning_ . [1] A teacher who may have
previously said, “I taught this standard to my students, and I hope they understand it,” can now assert,
“My students and I collaborated on this standard until they understood it. Here, let them show you their
proficiency with it.”



A third key feature is an engaging lesson structure that helps teachers lead students through fast-paced
practice, encourage perseverance, and foster thoughtful development of understanding. The four-part lesson
structure helps teachers focus their energy on engaging students in the mathematical story through the
introduction of challenging problems that call for quantitative and creative thinking. At the same time, lessons
provide problem-solving tools and models and help students identify common patterns. This is so students’
understanding of subjects, such as algebra, extends naturally from their knowledge of numbers, as the authors
of _Elementary Mathematics for Teachers_ [2] point out.



**Rooted in Cognitive and Developmental Science**



These instructional materials are built on basic scientific insights about math learning, growing out of
cognitive and developmental science. From cognitive science comes a picture of what it means to know
math and be prepared to use mathematical knowledge in the future. [3] From developmental science comes
a picture of how a classroom environment or culture can best motivate and engage the young learner’s
brain. [4]



This scientific evidence base wasn’t available when most teachers were growing up. Therefore, most teachers
encountered instructional materials based on conventional ideas. Now, however, this established science is
widely available, and the implications for math instructional materials are more fully understood.

**Improving Upon the Conventional Model of Math Education**


What is the key difference relative to the past? Previous instructional materials grew out of a very specific
theory of math learning where the young math learner was viewed primarily in terms of what they did not
yet understand—that is, their deficit in knowledge and skill. Therefore, the math instructional materials were
designed to remediate or fix a student’s deficient knowledge. This is why most lesson plans followed a familiar
pattern in which expertise flowed only from the teacher to the student, sometimes referred to as _I do, We do,_
_You do_ .


Though the _K-5 Math_ instructional materials do not follow the conventional “I do, We do, You do” model,
responsive scaffolding and a gradual release of responsibility is still necessary for students to engage in
appropriate productive struggle. If a teacher releases responsibility to students too early or doesn’t model
effectively, then students’ working memory may be overloaded, preventing the formation of schema in
long-term memory. Gradual release must be iterative and balanced because accuracy and fluency help
students apply the skills, procedures, and concepts they have learned to math problems in a new context.
When instructional materials ignore this science, it leads to a situation that math teachers find frustrating:
Students who have been clearly told how to solve a type of problem one way, but then fail to get it right on
the assessment (or in the next course). When students are appropriately supported by the teacher to build
automaticity, procedural fluency, and conceptual understanding, they can transfer their learning into new and
more complex situations that they have not seen before.


The _K-5 Math_ instructional materials reflect developmental science of what motivates and engages the young
learner’s brain. [5] As the young brain develops, especially in the years leading up to and including puberty, the
brain increasingly craves experiences such as independence, autonomy, and respect. When a student answers
a question incorrectly, they may think _my effort does not matter if the answer is not correct_, or _I’ll never be able_
_to do this without help_, or even _the teacher does not believe in me_ . This may lead students to reject a teacher’s
instruction, shy away from mistakes, fear challenges, and generally disengage from math. The _K-5 Math_
materials equip teachers with the tools to acknowledge incorrect responses and support students as they work
through misconceptions to increase their understanding and stay engaged in the math.


**A Culture of Learning**


These materials respond to this updated cognitive and developmental science, in part, by aiming to establish a
different kind of classroom culture. Simply put, they aim to shift math classrooms from a _culture of compliance_
to a _culture of learning._ [6] In the former, the student’s main job is to memorize and reproduce what the teacher
has explained. In the latter, the student’s main job is to piece together mathematical knowledge that they can
use to solve newer and increasingly difficult mathematical problems in the future. The differences appear in
the table on the next page. [7]

|_Learning_|Shallow and quickly forgotten|Complex and retained|


Why do the two cultures lead to different kinds of learning? Research has found that a culture of compliance
comes across as less respectful to students, and that respect is a critical ingredient to learning. How?
The culture of compliance implies to students that they don’t have the potential to form an independent
understanding of mathematics. If students in math courses start to suspect that their teacher doesn’t think
they have the potential to learn, they may conclude that the teacher doesn’t see them as a worthwhile
investment of time and energy to teach. It is easy to see how such a belief might make a student feel deflated
and disrespected.


On the other hand, a culture of learning comes across as highly respectful. [8] In a culture of learning, students
know that teachers see a mistake or struggle not as a sign of weakness, but as a sign that they have the
courage to take chances, work independently, and push the limits of their abilities. That is, students come to


8 Hecht, Bryan, and Yeager, “A Values-Aligned Intervention.”


**4** Program and Implementation Guide


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


view a mistake as something worthy of respect. This can be highly motivating to them because they can start
to feel that teachers view them as capable of doing difficult tasks.


Note that studies have consistently shown that a large majority of teachers prefer the culture of learning.
Math materials, however, have typically been misaligned to it, instead promoting a culture of compliance.
**The** _**K–5 Math**_ **instructional materials are meant to be a step toward correcting the misalignment between**
**what teachers have always wanted to do (and what young learners have always needed), and what**
**instructional materials have allowed teachers to do** _**.**_ It does so by making it simpler for instructors to create
a culture of learning.


**The Classroom Culture and Learning Pyramid**



To see how these materials are aligned to a culture
of learning, it can help to think of the metaphor of a
pyramid (see Fig 1 right). At the top of the pyramid is a
culture of learning, in which all students are prepared
for independent and fluent mathematical reasoning.
The three foundational corners to the pyramid are:
(1) _instructional materials_ that encourage students’
“ownership” over their mathematical thinking;
(2) a _teacher’s intention_ for all students to meet
that high standard, when provided with appropriate
support; and (3) _language and communication_ styles
that clarify the teacher’s and materials’ intent to
students. Language is a critical part of the pyramid
because many students are coming from a culture
of compliance, and so it needs to be clear how these
materials present new and expanded opportunities for
mathematical competency.









**1. The** _**K–5 Math**_ **Instructional Materials and a Culture of Learning**


These materials accomplish this shift by changing the structure of the lesson and by assigning students
problems at varying levels of complexity. The figure on the following page previews some—but not all—of
the key differences. The primary difference is that instead of explaining a correct way to solve a problem
(on the left), teachers engage students in the challenging task of developing ownership over the concept
(on the right). There are other, more subtle differences as well. For example, in a conventional lesson, the
common goal for bell ringers and guided practice is for all students to get 100% of the problems correct. In
any one of these lessons, however, the goal during fluency practice is rarely to get 100% right. If that happens,
it is often because the problems were not sufficiently challenging, given students’ preparation. Moreover,
in a conventional lesson, more time is spent on teachers explaining rather than students reflecting. Student
reflection is essential for allowing students the opportunity to consolidate what they have learned and
prepare to apply it in the future. Later in this guide, and throughout the modules, you will learn more details
about each of the elements.

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5







Although the figure above may seem like a dramatic shift, in fact these materials are more aligned to what
most teachers already know about how to get better at any skill. In general, the path from being a novice
to becoming an expert goes through struggle and difficulty. Thus, instructional materials that prevent
students from facing productive struggle or difficulty are a poor fit with how people actually learn. [9] _K–5 Math_
instructional materials seek to change this.


**2. Supporting Teachers’ Intentions to Maintain High Standards for All Students**


The foundation in cognitive and developmental science of these materials, with an emphasis on students’
independent thinking and reasoning, brings some potential concerns for teachers. Chief among them is the
fact that students tend to feel discomfort during struggle and difficulty. Because of this, students may avoid
challenges in math. Students may even want teachers to quickly explain the right answer rather than having to
solve problems independently.


This creates a dilemma for teachers. If they lower standards and do students’ thinking for them, then students
will not receive the benefits of the materials and could experience bigger concerns later in their mathematical
journeys. If teachers maintain high standards for student thinking, then students may feel uncomfortable or
distressed–or may even end up failing. This is called the _mentor’s dilemma_, [10] which refers to the difficulty of
upholding high standards while motivating all students to meet them.


The _K–5 Math_ instructional materials are designed with an awareness of this dilemma and include resources
to help teachers resolve it, including within the vignette, the student debrief, and the margin notes of each
lesson. Specifically, these materials have an explicit focus on helping students embrace _productive struggle_ .
Productive struggle is when students engage in productive problem solving, including multiple opportunities
for practice, discussion, representations, and writing that requires them to explain and revise their thinking.


Students show productive struggle when they reconsider their strategy, consult the learning materials,
or ask for appropriate help from peers or teachers. In contrast, unproductive struggle is when a student
does not grasp a concept, recognize the need to revise, or disengages. Productive struggle is not “sink or
swim.” The goal is that students are able to persist with challenging math to become independent problem
solvers. Striking a balance of maintaining rigorous standards and providing scaffolds is key in creating the
ideal conditions for productive struggle. It is essential to provide direct and explicit initial instruction, clear
modeling, and then support students as they apply their new skills to problem-solving contexts.

**3. Language and Communication Styles that Clarify Intentions**


How can teachers best promote a culture of learning—and therefore promote students’ productive struggle?
_Language and communication_ —or how instructional activities are presented to students—represent one
powerful method. Indeed, research has found that _**consistently communicating your intentions and beliefs**_
_**for every student’s potential to learn and grow their ability can be a powerful tool for helping to engage**_
_**students in productive struggle**_ . [11]


Why do language and communication matter? Students are more likely to embrace discomfort or productive
struggle when they are given a good reason that resonates with them. [12] If students are coming from a culture
of compliance, then struggling in class is likely to be interpreted in a negative light—as a sign that the teacher
is looking down on them for failing to pay attention or feels that the student lacks the innate potential to do
well. Students who experience a culture of compliance are unlikely to presume positive intent when they are
challenged.


A survey of Texas math students illustrates this point. Students were asked why they thought teachers used
various practices that are known to support student learning:


⬛
_Why do you think math teachers call on kids in the middle of class to answer a question?_
Student Answer: “To make sure you are paying attention.”


⬛
_Why does that teacher ask you to show your work?_
Student Answer: “To make sure you are not cheating.”


An important thing to notice is that many teachers’ behaviors were viewed by students in the worst possible
light. Clearly, teachers’ good intentions were not being recognized or understood. Even if teachers are exerting
a tremendous amount of effort to help students learn, they could be negatively impacting student learning by
leaving students feeling resentful and alienated throughout the school year. Communicating why teachers are
asking certain questions or engaging in difficult tasks will help motivate students to answer the question or try
the task and persevere through challenges while making them feel cared for at the same time.


**The power of language.** Language that clarifies the teacher’s intentions is a powerful tool that teachers can
use to help transition students out of a culture of compliance and into a culture of learning.


Psychological experiments have found that even small shifts in language have led students to comply
more willingly with a teacher’s demanding coursework. [13] Examples of short but important clarifications
from teachers include explaining the teacher’s intentions (e.g., “The reason why we’re about to do this
is because…”) and clarifying the teacher’s belief in students potential (e.g., “I’m asking you to think
independently on this assignment because I have very high standards and I know you can meet them.”).


The teacher’s edition of each module offers vignettes that include teacher/student conversations. These
vignettes emphasize that the activities and lessons are designed to help students meet high standards
while thinking independently and learning from mistakes. Moreover, the vignettes can be adapted to match
different teaching styles and encourage students to embrace the challenge of productively struggling in
math.

**Language and Communication**


**Redefining Mistakes and Learning Moments**


One of the most important philosophical underpinnings of the _K–5 Math_ instructional materials is in
responding to student mistakes. As shown in the culture of learning vs. culture of compliance table on page 4,
a mistake should not be seen as a definitive statement about a student’s potential. Instead, it should be
viewed as the beginning of a learning opportunity. Indeed, it is well-known that students need to productively
struggle after they make mistakes to learn from them. A teacher’s language and communication about
mistakes can have a profound impact on their culture of learning.


Why does the way we talk about mistakes matter? Because when students make mistakes, they feel
vulnerable and sometimes embarrassed. After all, nobody likes admitting that they failed at something.
Young people in particular may fear making mistakes if they think they are disappointing teachers, or if they
worry they will be punished. **Therefore, one of the most significant things a teacher can do to create a**
**culture of learning is to have routines to celebrate and reinforce the importance of mining mistakes for**
**good mathematical thinking and reframing them into** _**learning moments.**_ One way to accomplish this is to
incorporate a routine for collaboratively troubleshooting misconceptions which is facilitated by the _K–5 Math_
instructional materials.


**Collaboratively Troubleshooting Misconceptions**


_Collaborative troubleshooting_ is a three-step routine to help teachers gain a deeper understanding from
conversations with students so they can better examine mistakes and uncover misconceptions. [14]


The three steps to collaborative troubleshooting are:


1. Surface student thinking.
2. Validate what the student did right.
3. Bridge to a better understanding.









14 Yeager, _10 to 25: The Science of Motivating Young People_, 25; Texas Behavioral Science & Policy Institute, University of Texas, “FUSE: Fellowship Using the
Science of Engagement.”


**8** Program and Implementation Guide


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


Throughout the materials, there are opportunities to engage in collaborative troubleshooting with
students. Examples of elements that help address common student misconceptions and bridge to a better
understanding include the following:


⬛
_“Sprint” activities help students surface misconceptions and practice fluency._


⬛
_Turn and talk routines allow students to share their solutions and thinking with peers._


⬛
_Vignettes in the Concept Development section of the materials provide examples of student thinking_
_so that teachers can anticipate typical student responses._


⬛
_Error analysis of fictitious student work helps students feel comfortable examining and then_
_collaboratively troubleshooting their own errors or misconceptions._


⬛
_Daily Debriefs and Exit Tickets help students make connections between the lessons and problems_
_and allow students to reflect on their own depth of understanding._


**The Value of Collaborative Troubleshooting**


Collaborative troubleshooting helps students overcome the culture of fearing mistakes. When teachers
consistently use this routine, teachers and students work together—or “collaborate”—to make valuable
contributions to the learning process. While “troubleshooting” toward a better understanding, students
do not feel judged and may feel encouraged to tinker with their genuine curiosity.


In addition, collaborative troubleshooting helps teachers understand students’ thinking as they reason
through math. The more teachers view math through the eyes of the student, the better they can adapt
instruction in the moment. The routine provides teachers with valuable information that can be helpful in
anticipating how students may misunderstand their language or actions so they can communicate more
clearly and intentionally next time.


Indeed, different sources of error require different teaching strategies to fix them. If a student makes a
simple computation error, it is sometimes effective just to ask the student to try again. But if the student
misunderstands something foundational—or if they are too terrified to even try the problem—a teacher will
probably need to say something different.


Similarly, if a student arrives at a correct answer but has a misconception in their thought process,
collaborative troubleshooting may help catch the misconception before it becomes solidified as part of
the learning. Thus, if teachers collaborate with the student—and surface their thinking—then teachers can
troubleshoot the source of the error more effectively.


**How to Collaboratively Troubleshoot**


1. **Surface student thinking.** This first step is important because teachers can’t always guess exactly what
young people were thinking when they made a decision. If teachers make incorrect assumptions,
young people can feel disrespected and shut down. Therefore the best approach is to _ask, not assume_ .
An example is this: _Could you show me what you’ve tried already, so I can understand your reasoning?_
_Then we can try to troubleshoot it together._
2. **Validate what they got right:** Say something concrete and transparent about what the young person
did correctly, even if they made a mistake somewhere else. This step matters because the brain
tends to focus only on the negative. That can make young people take an all-or-nothing perspective
on a mistake. They may think the teacher believes their answer offers nothing of value, which feels


Program and Implementation Guide **9**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


disrespectful. Also, if teachers don’t acknowledge the parts they got right, students may discard
such thinking as well as the learning that came with it. Therefore, it’s important to make a clear and
authentic statement of what young people got right. An example is this: _I noticed you showed some_
_careful thinking when …_ [describe what they got right]. … _That really helped you move toward a_
_solution. Now we just need to figure out how to do the final piece…_
3. **Bridge to a better understanding.** Leading questions can help young people bridge to a better
understanding. These questions build on what they already know and help them see a connection to
what they need to learn. Leading questions are a way to impart knowledge while also having young
people “own” their thinking. Leading questions ( _How might you… or What would happen if…_ ) are a
clear signal to troubleshoot and tinker. An example is this: _Let’s build on the thinking you already did._
_What would happen if you ...?_


**Importance of Clear Communication**


At each step in the collaborative troubleshooting routine, it’s important to pay attention to language and
communication. Young people are used to hearing language with negative connotations in a culture of
compliance. Therefore, it’s important to be explicit and say what we _intend_, and override what they are used
to hearing.


The table below shows the kinds of questions that may appear in a collaborative troubleshooting routine. An
exemplar of what Collaborative Troubleshooting can look and sound like at a specific grade level can be found
in the Course Guide for that grade level.


















|Collaborative<br>troubleshooting step|What we often<br>say or do|What young people are<br>used to hearing<br>(in a culture of<br>compliance)|What we intend to<br>communicate<br>(in a culture of learning)|
|---|---|---|---|
|**1. Surface thinking**|_What were you_<br>_thinking?_|_You weren’t thinking._|_What can you tell me about_<br>_your thinking on this problem?_<br>_Where did you start? What did_<br>_you do next?_|

**Instructional Materials Design**


The design of these instructional materials is based on the principle that mathematics is most effectively
taught as a logical, engaging story. [15] In these instructional materials, the main character is the unit—the
basic building block of arithmetic. Themes such as measurement, place value, and fractions run throughout
the storyline, and each is given the amount of time proportionate to its role in the overall story. The story
culminates with students learning to add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions and to solve multi-step word
problems with multiplicative and additive comparisons.


Each module is a chapter in the larger story within and across grades, creating a path for teachers and
students to travel together, developing profound conceptual understanding along the way. [16] Through the
underlying and coherent theme of the unit, the lesson materials highlight the connectedness of math. This
connectedness promotes deep learning and transfer learning, in which students relate ideas and extend them
to apply their understanding in new situations. [17] Teachers and students experience mathematics as a unified
body of knowledge.


**The Significance of the Unit**


Even as new concepts are introduced, the overarching theme of the story remains: developing an
understanding of the basic building block of arithmetic, the unit. Studying, relating, manipulating, and
converting the unit allows students to complete word problems; to add, subtract, multiply, and divide; and to
understand concepts such as place value, fractions, measurements, area, and volume.


**Example 1: Addition of Like Units**


_An understanding of the unit starts with everyday objects (e.g., fingers, dogs, apples) and then moves into_
_both a measurement and a number context (e.g., centimeters, tens, eighths). As this sample sequence shows,_
_the unit changes but the way to operate on the numbers remains the same. Add like units: 2 units plus 3 units_
_equals 5 units, whether the units are dogs, fours, or tenths._


2 dogs + 3 dogs = 5 dogs

2 fours + 3 fours = 5 fours

2 meters + 3 meters = 5 meters

2 tens + 3 tens = 5 tens

2 tenths + 3 tenths = 5 tenths

2 eighths + 3 eighths = 5 eighths

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


**Example 2: Addition of Like Units with Decomposition**


_Out of this foundation grows the understanding that units can be manipulated (e.g., composed, decomposed,_
_renamed). 11 units can be decomposed as 10 units and 1 unit, whether it is 11 tens or 11 tenths. Students_
_apply this knowledge in a new way to create 1 whole when they decompose 11 eighths as 8 eighths and_
_3 eighths._


**Example 3: Addition of Mixed Units**


2 dogs 4 puppies + 3 dogs 5 puppies = 5 dogs 9 puppies


2 tens 4 ones + 3 tens 5 ones = 5 tens 9 ones


2 feet 4 inches + 3 feet 5 inches = 5 feet 9 inches


2 hours 4 minutes + 3 hours 5 minutes = 5 hours 9 minutes

As the examples show, learning sequences progress within and across grade levels, giving students
opportunities to apply their knowledge across concepts. As Hattie, et al assert, “…transfer learning
happens when students can make connections among mathematical understandings and then use those
understandings to solve problems in unfamiliar situations, at the same time being intentionally aware of what
they are doing.” [18] Through the logical, sequential design of these instructional materials, students learn that
unit-based procedures are transferable, and they use them to build upon their knowledge in new ways.


These instructional materials are designed to be educative, that is, to strengthen teachers’ pedagogical and
content knowledge while building students’ knowledge and skills. [19] Research-based design principles are
woven throughout the materials in embedded supports such as the following.


**Lesson Structure**


⬛
A four-part lesson structure contains learning progressions that move from simple to complex
and which create a crucial, daily interplay between the components of fluency, application, and
conceptual understanding. [20] A Student Debrief ends each lesson, holding space for students to
reflect on and process their learning.


⬛
Daily, intentional opportunities for students to engage in, such as


⬛
discourse and reflection through turn and talk, think–pair–share, and error analysis;


⬛
high-level thinking, through tasks that promote reasoning and problem solving; and


⬛
flexible thinking, through the sharing and connecting of multiple representations and solution
strategies.

_Concrete-Representational-Abstract Approach_


Research shows that instructional sequencing that moves through a concrete-representational-abstract
progression promotes deep learning as students make connections between the various representations. [22]

_Coherence of Models_











These instructional materials use a finite set of concrete and representational models. The repeated use
of familiar models supports the understanding of mathematical concepts across multiple grade levels. This
reveals the consistent concepts of arithmetic and operations as students’ work progresses: they first work
with single-digit whole numbers, then work with multi-digit numbers, and finally they work with fractional
and decimal numbers in the late elementary grades.









22 Hattie, et al., _Visible Learning for Mathematics_ .



Program and Implementation Guide **15**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


**Assessment**


These instructional materials use a systematic approach that includes formative and summative assessments
to gain data which can help inform instruction.







These instructional materials are guided by research-based evidence of effective instructional design and best
practices to optimize students’ mathematical learning. We believe these materials will encourage teachers to
deliver a high-quality learning experience while meeting the unique needs of the students in their classroom.


**Developing Self-Efficacy**


_Self-efficacy_ is an individual’s belief in their innate ability to achieve goals. According to Kirschner and
Hendrick, self-efficacy can influence learning, motivation, and self-regulation. [23]


Students who are self-regulated learners direct their own learning and are active participants in the learning
process. The ability to self-regulate can be influenced by a student’s learning environment. These materials
foster the conditions necessary for students to become strategic and goal-directed learners.


_Engagement_


Lessons engross students in the thinking and doing of mathematics. Rather than passively receiving
information, students make sense of information and grapple with ideas as they persist in mathematical tasks.
This type of mathematics instruction values productive struggle as a necessary component that gives way
to deep learning. The engaging tasks are within students’ reach while still providing challenge and requiring
effort. There are several opportunities for capturing student interest within the lesson structure.

**Multiple Representations:** Students share and compare various representations of mathematical concepts.
Teachers pose purposeful questions that support students in making explicit connections between
representations. As these connections are made, students see that situations can be represented in different
ways.


**Multiple Solution Paths:** Students self-select strategies and solution paths. Teacher questions and prompts
such as “Students may have different solutions. Invite them to share and compare their work.” reinforce that
there are multiple ways to approach a problem and that students can learn from their classmates. Students
are encouraged to revise their thinking and revisit strategies, which invites them to broaden their view of
mathematics.


**Discourse and Elaboration:** Students regularly explain and justify ideas, which deepens their own
understanding of mathematical concepts. Teacher questions and prompts such as the following appear
regularly throughout lessons:


⬛
“Talk with your partner. What just happened?”


⬛
“What happened when we added those numbers? Turn and talk.”


⬛
“Explain to your partner the steps you took to solve.”


Additionally, Problem Sets offer opportunities for students to express their reasoning through writing.


**Problem-Solving Routines:** Students in Grades 1–5 use the Read–Draw–Write (RDW) process to make sense
of problems, choose and apply mathematics, and solve. The RDW process prompts students to engage in
self-questioning. For example, “Can I draw something?”, “What can I draw?”, and “What does my drawing
show me?” Self-questioning promotes metacognition, or thinking about thinking, which supports students in
becoming strategic learners and helping them monitor and own their own learning.


Teachers play an important role by providing support when students encounter productive struggle as they
think and reason during these rich engagement opportunities.

The following are examples of what productive struggle in a supportive environment might look like and
sound like for students and for teachers.

That shows your<br>effort.”<br> <br>⬛<br>“Take a quick break and try again.”<br> <br>⬛<br>That was difficult, but you didn’t<br>give up, and you figured it out.”|



**Mistakes**


Opportunities for productive struggle are also times for making mistakes and uncovering misconceptions.
When students are afraid to make errors or worry about getting the wrong answer in front of their classmates,
they may be less willing to take risks and engage in challenging tasks. Teachers can create an environment
where students see productive struggle as a natural part of learning. [24] In this type of environment, errors and


24 National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). _Principles to Actions_, 50.


**18** Program and Implementation Guide


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


misconceptions are expected as part of the learning process. The following are suggestions for fostering a
learning environment that promotes perseverance.


⬛
Model self-talk that connects learning from mistakes to opportunities for future success. For example, “Now that I know___, I’ll remember to ____ next time I solve a problem like this.”


⬛
Highlight the advantages of engaging in challenging work, such as the opportunity to learn and grow.


⬛
Encourage students to focus on their personal bests and celebrate growth. Discuss how discovering
mistakes or errors led to their growth.


⬛
Recognize the role of effort in academic performance, emphasizing that all students can improve
with effort. Incorporate stories about real people who have overcome challenges and persevered.


⬛
Support students through challenging work instead of lowering rigor for a task. As students work,
help them set realistic goals and creating plans for their own improvement.


**Reflection**


Students who display metacognitive awareness recognize when they are not learning effectively and adopt
more productive learning strategies. [25] To support students in developing this type of awareness, teachers
can provide multiple opportunities for students to think about their progress and make plans for their own
improvement.


⬛
During Lessons: Throughout lessons and during whole-class and partner discussions, encourage students to reflect on their choices of strategies, models, and solution paths and whether they need to
revise their thinking. As part of the Student Debrief, students reflect on their progress relative to the
Problem Set and the overarching lesson goals.


Any combination of the questions below may be used to
lead the discussion.



Problem Set
Connection



⬛
What is the same and different about Problems 1(c) and 1(d)?
Did you solve the problems differently? Why or why not?



⬛
Look at Problem 1(f). Did the zero in 405 make the problem
challenging? Why?
Lesson ⬛ How did our fluency activities _Rename the Ten_ and ​
Connection _the Number Line_ help with our rounding work today?



⬛
How did our fluency activities _Rename the Ten_ and ​ _Halfway on_
_the Number Line_ help with our rounding work today?



​



Previous Day
Connection



⬛
Think back to yesterday’s activity where we measured and then
rounded at stations. How did that work help you envision the
units we worked with today on the number line?



⬛
After Assessments: Exit Tickets can be used to support students in determining which areas of learning they are confident in and which areas may need more attention. Support students in creating
plans for developing proficiency. Additionally, the Assessment Reflection Tool can be used to help
teachers promote a culture of productive struggle as students go into testing and to give students the
opportunity after testing to reflect on their learning.


25 Kirschner and Hendrick, _How Learning Happens._


Program and Implementation Guide **19**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


Encouraging regular cycles of reflection that combine performance data with plans for improvement support
development of students’ self-efficacy. Students recognize that active participation in their own learning
contributes to their success.













**TEKS Mathematical Process**
**Standards**


The TEKS Mathematical Process Standards (MPS)
are embedded throughout the program. They
are seamlessly woven into the lesson structure to
require the level of thinking and behaviors that
the standards embody. Here are some examples
of how the TEKS MPS live in these materials:


⬛
Purposeful integration of a variety of
problem types that range in complexity
naturally invites students to analyze givens, constraints, relationships, and goals.


⬛
Models, drawings, numeric representations, and precise language make student learning and thinking understood
by others.


⬛
During debriefs, teachers lead students
in discussions or writing exercises that
prompt students to analyze and explain
their work, reflect on their own learning, and make connections between
concepts.



**TEKS Mathematical Process Standards**


The student is expected to:


A. apply mathematics to problems arising in everyday life,
society, and the workplace;

B. use a problem-solving model that incorporates
analyzing given information, formulating a plan or
strategy, determining a solution, justifying the solution,
and evaluating the problem-solving process and the
reasonableness of the solution;

C. select tools, including real objects, manipulatives,
paper and pencil, and technology, as appropriate and
techniques, including mental math, estimation, and
number sense, as appropriate to solve problems;

D. communicate mathematical ideas, reasoning, and
their implications by using multiple representations,
including symbols, diagrams, graphs, and language as
appropriate;

E. create and use representations to organize, record, and
communicate mathematical ideas;

F. analyze mathematical relationships to connect and
communicate mathematical ideas; and

G. display, explain, and justify mathematical ideas and
arguments using precise mathematical language in
written or oral communication.



**20** Program and Implementation Guide


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


Although all lessons provide space for TEKS MPS by design, a chart in each grade-level’s Course Guide
helps teachers track which lessons emphasize each TEKS MPS, make instructional decisions about lesson
sequences, and adapt lessons for their classrooms. More than one TEKS MPS may be identified per
lesson.


**Module Structure**


**Module Overview**


The Module Overview summarizes the development of student learning throughout each topic of the module.
It helps teachers understand the module’s placement in the overall development of learning in and across the
grade levels.









Program and Implementation Guide **21**

_Collaboratively Troubleshooting Student Misconceptions_


This component includes a table in the Module Overview that presents teachers with guidance on how
to address misconceptions that may arise in mathematical concepts in each module. The table identifies
common misconceptions and offers teachers suggestions to effectively respond to students during their
moments of productive struggle. These just-in-time suggestions are intended for use during regular class
instruction as students build on what they know and bridge to new understandings. More guidance is included
in each Course Guide and includes instructional strategies and sample guided questions to surface thinking,
validate the student’s correct understandings, and create new and sound conceptions about math in the
module and the grade.


_Terminology_


Terminology includes two sections. New or Recently Introduced Terms are discipline-specific words that are
introduced to students in the current module. Familiar Terms and Symbols are items that were introduced or
used in previous grades or modules. Terminology also includes Spanish cognates where applicable.


_K–5 Math_ instructional materials use an approach to teaching terminology based on language acquisition
theory. First, students experience a concept through concrete materials or pictorial representations.
Next, they describe or name the concept informally, using familiar, everyday words. Once they have a
clear understanding of the concept, they apply discipline-specific terminology, supported by usage of the
terminology resource.


**22** Program and Implementation Guide


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


For example, in acquiring the term _greater_, students initially notice differences in quantities of objects or
pictures. They might call a number “bigger” or describe a set as having “a lot more.” At that point, the teacher
provides the term _greater_, formally naming the concept by using discipline-specific terminology. From then
on, students might use both terms interchangeably as they engage in rich mathematical discourse. The
Terminology resource can support and deepen student understanding as the need arises.


In addition, use the Terminology resource to generate supports for students. Show students the visuals from
the teacher-facing Module Overview that correspond to the terminology and encourage them to naturally use
terminology as they respond in class to discussion questions or in Turn and Talks. Use the list to create just-intime supports to help them internalize the words once they have developed conceptual understanding of the
mathematics. Many lessons illustrate possible opportunities for formalizing language as exemplar student
responses in lessons, but there are many more points throughout the lesson and the school day to highlight
and reinforce these terms.



Each term includes
a student-friendly
definition or description
and an illustration as it
appears in the module.

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


**Topic Overview**


Each topic in the module begins with a Topic Overview that includes focus standards, the number of
instructional days, coherent links to previous and subsequent modules, and a summary of the development of
learning. The Topic Overview concludes with a list of teacher-facing objectives and corresponding lessons that
comprise the teaching sequence of the topic.









The **Topic Overview** details the
flow of content, calls attention to
important strategies or models, and
highlights how learning connects to
previous or upcoming content.


**Lesson Overview**







Each lesson is structured into four sections: Fluency Practice, Application Problem, Concept Development, and
Student Debrief. (For more details, see Lesson Structure.)


In Grades 1 **–** 5, lessons are designed for one 60-minute instructional period. In Grade K, lessons are designed
for one 50-minute instructional period.


**Answer Keys**


The Answer Key for each lesson can be found at the end of every module. Answers are included for the Sprint
(if applicable), Problem Set, Exit Ticket, and Homework. In Grade K, Exit Tickets are not included until Module 5.


**Lesson Structure**


**Overview**


The lesson structure is comprised of four critical components that promote balanced and rigorous
instruction. Each lesson is structured to include fluency activities, development of conceptual understanding
and procedural skills, application of concepts to problem solving, and an opportunity to build a shared
understanding of the lesson objective. (Note that objectives should not be student-facing unless they are
revised to be developmentally-appropriate for the grade level.)

These components are taught through the deliberate progression of material from concrete to
representational to abstract. Lesson components and stages of instruction within these components are
designed to help students reach higher and higher levels of understanding. Patterns and connections between
concepts, tools, strategies, and real-world applications naturally surface with this balanced approach to lesson
design.

_Use of Technology and External Sites_


Students solve problems by using a variety of tools and techniques as appropriate. They are expected to
self-select tools, including real-world objects, manipulatives, paper and pencil, and technology to support
the problem-solving process. Students are also expected to strategically apply techniques, such as mental
math, estimation, and number sense, to problem-solving. There are notes in the teacher-facing materials that
provide optional opportunities for teachers to engage students through the whole-group use of interactive
technology. In some instances, this may entail using a word processing document, spreadsheet, or interactive
white board. Teachers may also select an educational site to display and use as a class. Teachers must preview
and vet sites they display for students prior to classroom use. Additionally, students may use a calculator, as
appropriate, at teacher discretion (e.g. to efficiently generate calculations in service of identifying patterns, to
verify solutions).


**Fluency Practice**



Energizing fluency activities provide distributed practice
with previously learned material and prepare students
for new learning by activating prior knowledge. Fluency
activities comprise about 10 minutes of the total lesson time.
Automaticity, or instant recall of basic facts, is critical so that
students avoid depleting their attention resources with lowerlevel skills when they are addressing higher-level problems.
This automaticity prepares students with the computational
foundation to solve problems flexibly, efficiently, and accurately.


Sprints are fluency routines that support students in staying
sharp with previously learned skills. To this end, Sprints are not
used as a summative assessment tool. However, Sprints can
be used to promote self-monitoring and self-improvement.
Teachers may use Sprints as a tool to observe student progress,
to make note of the types of problems or pattens that pose
a consistent challenge for students, and to guide future
instructional decisions.







As they prepare to teach a lesson, teachers are encouraged to think flexibly and customize fluency activities
to meet their students’ needs. For example, a teacher may select two of the three fluency activities that
best support student learning towards the lesson objective. Many fluency activities are flexible enough to be
completed during another time of day.

⬛ Nines to 90



**Do during lunch line-up**


**Do during lesson**



As students’ fluency with skip-counting improves, help them make a connection to multiplication by tracking
the number of groups they count using their fingers. **Connect finger counting to multiplication**



Application Problems generally comprise about 5 minutes of the total lesson time. _K–5 Math_ instructional
materials are designed to help students understand how to choose and apply the correct mathematical
concepts to solve real-world problems. To achieve this flexible thinking, lessons use tools and models, as well
as problems and patterns that cause students to think quantitatively and creatively. Application Problems
could relate directly to the Concept Development and may be used to activate schema or prepare students
for new learning. Single-step problems help students understand the meaning of new ideas, and multi-step
problems support and develop instructional concepts. Student work provides insight into their thought
processes and can be used to guide future instructional decisions.


Students in Grades 1–5 use a problem-solving approach called Read–Draw–Write (RDW), described on p. 34.
As students read and re-read a problem, they ask themselves questions such as, _Can I draw something?_
_What can I draw? What does my drawing show me?_ This metacognitive strategy helps students become
independent problem solvers. [26] The more often students use a systematic, transferable approach to reason
through problems, the more they internalize those behaviors and thought processes.

understanding to make

through new problems.

Program and Implementation Guide **27**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


_Concept Development_


Concept Development constitutes the major portion of instruction and generally comprises 20–30 minutes
of the total lesson time. This includes 10 minutes allotted for the Problem Set, an opportunity for
independent practice. The Concept Development is the primary lesson component in which new learning is
introduced.


Intentional sequencing of standards and topics within modules ensures that students have a requisite
understanding to fully access new learning goals and integrate them into their developing schemas. Much
of the Concept Development instruction articulates the TEKS and topics through a deliberate progression
of material from concrete to representational to abstract. This structure complements and supports an
increasingly complex understanding of concepts. [27]


Within lessons, students may encounter new and unfamiliar terminology. Students should explore the
meanings of key terminology during the conceptual development using everyday language and
conversational words. Once they have experienced the context, formalize the term by using the Terminology
resource definition and reinforce the proper usage of the term in context. Exemplar responses highlight
opportunities for students to use terminology naturally as they respond in class to discussion questions or in
Turn and Talks, but there are many more points throughout the lesson and the school day to fortify academic
terminology.



**Concept Development**


Students engage in
learning, reasoning, and
discourse related to the
lesson objective.





27 Agrawal and Morin, “Evidence-Based Practices,” 34–44.


**28** Program and Implementation Guide


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


**Problem Sets**


As part of the Concept Development, students may be asked to complete a Problem Set. The Problem Set often
includes fluency pertaining to the Concept Development as well as conceptual understanding and application
word problems. Problem Sets are intentionally crafted from simple to complex with various access points based
on a student’s current level of proficiency. The primary goal of the Problem Set is for students to apply the
conceptual understandings learned during the lesson and to work at their own level for 10 sustained minutes.


Teachers are encouraged to think flexibly and adjust the Problem Set depending on the needs of their
students. Teachers may specify “must do” problems that meet the objective of the day, and then assign “could
do” or “extension” problems if time permits. Alternatively, teachers might capitalize on the simple to complex
design by assigning students various starting points, based on their strengths and needs. For example,
students who need more proficiency practice might start on Problem 1, whereas students who already
demonstrate proficiency can begin at Problem 5, so that they reach the height of complexity and remain
challenged. Students are not expected to complete every problem in a 10-minute time frame.



**Problem Set**


Students apply conceptual
understanding to independent practice.


**Student Debrief**



**Problem Set (10 minutes)**



The lesson closes with a 10-minute Student Debrief, which includes 3 minutes for the Exit Ticket. Rather
than hearing the objective at the beginning of the lesson, students experience the learning through problem
solving and concept development. Then, during the debrief, the class gathers to reflect on the lesson and
to analyze new learning. This approach allows students, instead of the teacher, to articulate the focus of
the lesson. The questions in the Student Debrief develop students’ metacognition by helping them to make
connections among parts of the lesson, concepts, strategies, and tools on their own. Teachers invite students
to appropriately name the learning they describe, drawing out key vocabulary when the need for the name of
a strategy, concept, or tool is most needed—at the point of use.


Program and Implementation Guide **29**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


The goal is for students to see and hear multiple perspectives from their classmates and to mentally construct
a multifaceted image of the concepts being learned. Students articulate observations so that the objective
of the lesson becomes eminently clear to them. Thoughtful questions and dialogue help make connections
explicit and directly engage students in the TEKS Mathematical Process Standards.



**Student Debrief**


Students engage in
discussion, reflect,
and synthesize the
day’s learning.


**Exit Tickets**







The Exit Ticket is a critical element of the lesson structure. [28] This brief, 3-minute formative assessment
contains specific questions about what was learned that day. The purpose of the Exit Ticket is two-fold: To
teach students to grow accustomed to being held individually accountable for the work they have done after
one day’s instruction; and to provide the teacher with valuable evidence of the efficacy of that day’s work—
which is indispensable for planning purposes.

**Homework**


In these instructional materials, the Homework provides students with an opportunity for additional practice
of the skills and concepts from the day’s lesson. The goal of the Homework is not to introduce new concepts
or ideas, but to build student understanding and confidence with the material learned in class. The teacher is
encouraged, with the support of families, administrators, and colleagues, to discern the appropriate use of the
Homework for students. Fluency exercises can also be considered as an alternative homework assignment.

**Sprints**





**The Value of Sprints in the K–5 Math Instructional Materials**


Myth: The purpose of Sprints is to help students learn how to solve math problems quickly.


Reality: **Sprints offer concentrated fluency practice on specific skills and concepts.**


A well-managed and carefully timed routine is used in a Sprint to create an environment where students
are fully engaged and focused on the activity. [29] Students are not expected to complete all of the problems
and should not be assessed on their speed. Instead, Sprints are intentionally designed to provide students
with opportunities to strive for and measure their improvement from one Sprint to the next within an
engaging and motivating environment.


29 Fuchs, L.S., et al., “Assisting Students.”


Program and Implementation Guide **31**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5



Myth: Sprints require students to rely on rote memorization or rote procedure.


Reality: **Sprints build understanding and flexible problem solving.**



12 = 4 × ____


12 = 2 × 2 × ____



Sprints support procedural fluency, a critical component of mathematical

12 = 3 × 2 × ____

proficiency by fostering conceptual understanding and flexible problem
solving. [30] The problems in each Sprint are carefully selected and sequenced to
help students recognize patterns and structures to solve subsequent, more complex problems.
For example, consider the sequence of problems shown. The first problem contains an unknown factor.
The second problem intentionally decomposes the known factor in the first problem, 4, into 2 × 2. The
third problem is a variation of the second problem with one given factor changed. This type of sequence
allows students to solve the problems by flexibly using factual recall, pattern recognition, and numeracy
strategies.


Myth: Sprints introduce new learning in a lesson.


Reality: **Sprints distribute practice over time.**


Sprints distribute practice over time, which leads to better retention of learning. [31] The mathematics in the
Sprint may be related to the lesson but it is not used to introduce new learning.


Myth: Sprints use problems that aren’t appropriate for some students.


Reality: **Sprints let all students practice at the level appropriate for them.**


Sprints allow students to focus on their own growth and to strive for their personal best. The problems
are intentionally designed to progress in difficulty from simple to complex, and students are not expected
to complete all of the problems. Instead, each student does their personal best based on their current
automaticity with a given concept or skill.


Myth: Sprints should be a graded activity.


Reality: **Sprints are practice and formative assessments.**


Sprints are practice. They are not summative assessments. Sprints allow students to see their
improvement from one Sprint to the next and provide teachers with a sense of each student’s
automaticity with a particular concept or skill. Grading of Sprints is strongly discouraged.

**Suggested Methods of Instructional Delivery**


**Directions for Administration of Sprints**


Sprints are designed to develop fluency. They should be fun, adrenaline-rich activities that intentionally
build energy and excitement. A fast pace is essential. During Sprint administration, teachers assume the role
of athletic coaches. A routine fuels students’ motivation to do their personal best. Student recognition of
increasing success is critical, and so every improvement is celebrated.


One Sprint has two parts with closely related problems on each. Students complete the two parts of the Sprint
in quick succession with the goal of improving on the second part, even if only by one more.


With practice, the following routine takes about 9 minutes.


**Sprint A**


Pass Sprint A out quickly, face down on student desks with instructions to not look at the problems until the
signal is given. (Some Sprints include words. If necessary, prior to starting the Sprint, quickly review the words
so that reading difficulty does not slow students down.)


T:  You will have 60 seconds to do as many problems as you can. I do not expect you to finish all of them.
Just do as many as you can, your personal best. (If some students are likely to finish before time is up,
assign a number to count by on the back.)


T: Take your mark! Get set! THINK!


Students immediately turn papers over and work to finish as many problems as they can in 60 seconds.
Time precisely.


T:  Stop! Circle the last problem you did. I will read just the answers. If you got it right, call out “Yes!” If
you made a mistake, circle it. Ready?


T: (Energetically, rapid-fire call the first answer.)


S: Yes!


T: (Energetically, rapid-fire call the second answer.)


S: Yes!


Repeat to the end of Sprint A or until no student has a correct answer. If needed, read the count-by answers
in the same way the Sprint answers were read. Each number counted-by on the back is considered a correct
answer.


T:  Fantastic! Now, write the number you got correct at the top of your page. This is your personal goal
for Sprint B.


If the class needs more practice with Sprint A, continue with the optional routine presented below.


T: I’ll give you one minute to do more problems on this half of the Sprint.
T: Stop! I will read just the answers. If you got it right, call out “Yes!” If you made a mistake, circle it.
Ready? (Read the answers to the first half again as students stand.)


Program and Implementation Guide **33**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


**Movement**


To keep the energy and fun going, always do a stretch or a movement game in between Sprints A and B. For
example, the class might do jumping jacks while skip-counting by 5 for about 1 minute. Feeling invigorated,
students take their seats for Sprint B, ready to make every effort to complete more problems this time.


**Sprint B**


Pass Sprint B out quickly, face down on student desks with instructions not to look at the problems until the
signal is given. (Repeat the procedure for Sprint A.)


T:  Well done! Now, take a moment to go back and correct your mistakes. Think about what patterns you
noticed in today’s Sprint.


T: How did the patterns help you get better at solving the problems?


T: Rally Robin your thinking with your partner for 1 minute. Go!


Rally Robin is a style of sharing in which partners trade information back and forth, one statement at a time
per person, for about 1 minute. This is an especially valuable part of the routine for students who benefit from
their friends’ support to identify patterns and try new strategies.


Students may take Sprints home.


**Read–Draw–Write**


Support students as they problem solve by using a simple, repeatable process. The Read–Draw–Write (RDW)
process calls for students to


1. Read the problem.
2. Draw and label.
3. Write a number sentence (equation).
4. Write a word sentence (statement).


Families may support the process by encouraging their student to ask themselves questions such as


⬛
What do I see?


⬛
Can I draw something?


⬛
What conclusions can I make from my drawing?

The more students participate in reasoning through problems with this systematic approach, the more they
internalize these practices and thought processes.


**Personal Whiteboards**


**Materials Needed for Personal White Boards**


1 heavy-duty clear sheet protector
1 piece of stiff red tag board 11" × 8"


**34** Program and Implementation Guide


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


1 piece of stiff white tag board 11" × 8"
1 3" × 3" piece of dark synthetic cloth for an eraser (e.g., felt)
1 low-odor dry-erase marker, fine point


**Directions for Creating Personal White Boards**


Cut the white and red tag to specifications. Slide into the sheet protector. Store the eraser on the red side.
Store markers in a separate container to avoid stretching the sheet protector.


**Frequently Asked Questions About Personal White Boards**


_Why is one side red and one white?_


The white side of the board is the “paper.” Students generally write on it, and if working individually, turn the
board over to signal to the teacher that they have completed their work. The teacher then says, “Show me
your boards,” when most of the class is ready.


_What are some of the benefits of a personal white board?_


⬛
The teacher can respond quickly to a gap in student understandings and skills. “Let’s do some of
these on our personal white boards until we are more proficient.”


⬛
Students can erase mistakes and make corrections to their work.


⬛
They are motivating. Students love both the drill and thrill capability and the chance to do story problems with an engaging medium.


⬛
Checking work gives the teacher instant feedback about student understanding.


_What is the benefit of this personal white board over a commercially purchased dry-erase board?_


⬛
Templates such as place value charts, number bond mats, hundreds boards, and number lines can be
stored between the two pieces of tag board for quick access and reuse.


⬛
Worksheets, story problems, and other problem sets can be done without marking the paper so that
students can work on the problems independently at another time.


⬛
Strips with story problems, number lines, and arrays can be inserted and still have a full piece of
paper on which to write.


⬛
The red versus white side distinction clarifies expectations. When working collaboratively, there is
no need to use the red side. When working independently, students know how to keep their work
private.


⬛
The tag board can be removed so that student work can be projected on an overhead.


**Differentiation and Scaffolds**


Equitable instruction requires that all students have access to the same high-quality grade-level content. To
this end, linguistic and academic scaffolding is folded into the instructional materials in such a way that it is
part of its very DNA. Therefore, faithful adherence to the modules is the primary scaffolding tool. The modules
reinforce that the components of excellent math instruction do not change based on the audience.


Program and Implementation Guide **35**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


There may however be instances when students need individualized attention based on their unique needs.
Meeting student needs can happen in several ways, including maximizing learning within the zone of proximal
development, drawing on students’ experiences, and creating a rich learning environment with plenty of time
for collaboration and specific cognitive supports. [32] To this end, strategically placed margin notes are provided
within each lesson to elaborate on the use of specific scaffolds at applicable times for all students, including
students participating in bilingual education programs and receiving instruction in partner language and
English. They address needs presented by emergent bilingual students, students with disabilities, students who
demonstrate proficiency, and students who need more practice building proficiency. The scaffolds integrated into
these instructional materials give alternatives for how students access information, and how they express and
demonstrate their learning.

The suggestions are grounded in three learning principles:


⬛
Provide multiple means of representation by using a variety of methods to present information and
support understanding of vocabulary and symbols to maximize comprehension .


⬛
Provide multiple means of action and expression by varying methods for response and ways to
demonstrate knowledge and skills.


⬛
Provide multiple means of engagement by optimizing interest and offering varied levels of challenge
to promote productive struggle.


The following chart provides examples of scaffolds. Note that some scaffolds may be used in more than one
type of note depending on the intent such as language and content for EB students. As appropriate, provide
scaffolds in the moment to the whole class or individuals, or in small group settings. With any scaffold,
students may use their primary language and be encouraged to make cross-linguistic connections.

**36** Program and Implementation Guide


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


Additionally, most lessons contain a suggested teaching sequence that moves from simple to complex. For
example, a lesson could begin with an introductory problem for a math topic and then build up inductively
to a general case that encompasses multifaceted ideas. By structuring problems from simple to complex,
teachers can locate specific steps that students need proficiency with or stretch problems for students who
desire a challenge.


Throughout these instructional materials, teachers are encouraged to give classwork by using a timeframe
rather than a task frame. All students are expected to do their personal best, working at their maximum
potential within a given timeframe. Some students will complete more work than others. Students are
encouraged to strive for personal success. Another vitally important component for meeting the needs of
all students is the constant flow of data from student work, including tracking through an Exit Ticket for
each lesson, as well as Mid-Module and End-of-Module assessments to determine student understanding at
benchmark points. Such data flow keeps the teaching practice firmly grounded in student learning and makes
incremental forward movement possible.


**Structuring Student Groupings**


Responsive instruction includes flexible groups that change frequently based on students’ needs.


⬛
Small groups may address misconceptions by using the guidance found in the Learning from
Misconceptions section of each module.


⬛
Small groups may apply the scaffolds and extensions recommended in margin notes.


⬛
Pair students who have different levels of mathematical proficiency and students who have different
levels of English language proficiency.


⬛
Group students who achieve above proficiency levels on assessments for enrichment opportunities
such as the challenge options found in Multiple Means of Engagement margin notes.


Additionally, teachers can always group students strategically and flexibly in partner pairs based on their
mathematical and English language proficiency. Pairing students who speak the same home language can
complement any strategic grouping.


**Approach to Assessments**


Assessments provide an opportunity for students to show their learning accomplishments in addition to
offering students a pathway to monitor their progress, celebrate successes, examine mistakes, uncover
misconceptions, and engage in self-reflection and analysis. Assessments are driven by a continuous cycle:
plan, teach, assess, and analyze. This highly effective structure provides crucial feedback to the teacher.
Teachers adjust and respond, basing their instructional choices on the evidence they gather. “Implementing
this assessment process leads to significant improvements in children’s academic outcomes and teachers’ own
professional growth.” [33]


33 National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, _Catalyzing Change_, 35.


Program and Implementation Guide **37**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5



Furthermore, the data collected from the assessments provide teachers
with specific information about student understanding to help direct
instruction. In _Principles to Actions_, NCTM speaks to the value of datadriven instruction as part of its vision for an effective assessment
program (emphasis added):


Effective assessment of mathematics learning is a process that is
**coherently aligned with learning goals**, **makes deliberate use of**
**the data** gathered as evidence of learning, and **provides guidance**
**for next instructional steps** and programmatic decision making.
In excellent mathematics programs, **students learn to assess and**
**recognize high quality in their own work** . [34]











In these instructional materials, assessment becomes a regular part of the classroom routine in the form
of daily, mid-module, and end-of-module assessment tasks. Both mid-module and end-of-module tasks are
designed for quick teacher scoring so that teachers can give students instructionally relevant, actionable
feedback and monitor the effectiveness of their instruction to make any needed adjustments. These MidModule and End-of-Module tasks should be used in conjunction with instructionally embedded tasks and
other formative assessment strategies to realize the full benefits of data-driven instruction. In addition, the
Assessment Reflection Tool complements other assessment tools by offering students an opportunity to
pause and reflect after the assessment tasks.











34 National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, _Principles to Actions_, 92.


**38** Program and Implementation Guide


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5



**Problem Sets**


Problem Sets are designed to move from simple to complex
problems, building on previous knowledge in small attainable steps.
The intentionally-crafted teaching sequences found in Problem Sets
build confidence and nudge students steadily toward proficiency. [35]
By focusing on how students interacted with the Problem Set,
teachers can ascertain how well students grasped new concepts and
skills introduced in the lesson. Teachers may note the number or
type of problems that students completed, along with their preferred
strategies and models. Then teachers can use this information to
probe during the Student Debrief that follows, and/or plan for future
instruction. Though designed for practice, Problem Sets can also
serve as formative assessments that provide another opportunity to
monitor student learning.





**Exit Tickets**


Exit Tickets are brief, daily, formative assessments which
typically contain one or two problems at a similar level
of complexity as the Concept Development. Referred
to as “power assessments” [36] in _Visible Learning,_ they
give teachers a snapshot of students’ understanding
of the lesson, uncover misconceptions, and indicate
which students may benefit from additional practice,
all of which drives instruction for the following day
in an efficient and responsive manner. With frequent
progress-monitoring, teachers can adjust instruction
based on students’ strengths and needs.

**Kindergarten Interview and Observational Assessments**


Interview-style Module Assessments take inspiration from the Latin
root word _assidere_, which means _to sit beside_ . The interview affords
students the unique opportunity to showcase what they know, can
do, and express through multiple modalities: writing, speaking, and
demonstrating. Teachers not only build relationships by sitting beside
students to interview them, but they also gain a clear and accurate
picture of student understanding that is generally unattainable
through pencil and paper options. Interviewing and observing are
age-appropriate means of assessment and provide a window into the
approach that the student used (subitizing, counting all, or another
strategy) to solve a problem. Careful language in the rubric provides
teachers with guidance in scoring; more importantly, as students
move towards proficiency for each TEKS, the rubric helps teachers
understand common student preconceptions or misconceptions for
discrete portions of knowledge or specific skills.

Early childhood experts Carol Copple and Sue Bredekamp
recommend observing, documenting, and assessing young
learners’ progress in multiple contexts, over multiple
opportunities, and by acquiring data from multiple
sources. [37] To this end, the Observational Assessment
checklist provides a means of recording observations
while students work on math tasks during the day. This
convenient tool for formative assessment makes it
possible to observe and assess kindergarteners during
regular instructional time, as well as during unplanned
opportunities such as daily routines and play. Regular
use of the Observational Assessment checklist reduces
the amount of time spent on module assessments
because some items may not need to be administered
to all students once observational data is gathered. For
example, if the teacher observes and records proficiency
with using data to create real-object and picture graphs,
they have evidence of student proficiency without needing
to administer the corresponding item in the interview
assessment. _K–5 Math_ instructional materials provide
an opportunity for students to show their learning
accomplishments through observational, anecdotal, and
formal methods of assessment.

**Mid-Module Assessment Task**


A Mid-Module Assessment Task is provided with most modules, along with scoring information. These tasks
are specifically tailored to address approximately the first half of the student learning outcomes for that
module. Careful language in the rubric provides teachers with guidance in scoring; more importantly, the
rubric helps teachers understand common student preconceptions or misconceptions for discrete portions
of knowledge or specific skills, as students move towards proficiency for each TEKS. Typically, Mid-Module
Assessment tasks should be completed independently by students within one class period. The tasks
should be new to the students and not preceded by analogous problems. Teachers may use these tasks
either formatively or summatively. After students have completed the Mid-Module Assessment Task, it is



**End-of-Module Assessment Task**


A summative End-of-Module Assessment Task, along with
a rubric for scoring, is also provided for each module. Tasks
are specifically designed, based on the standards addressed
to gauge students’ understanding of the module as a whole.
Some items test understanding of specific TEKS, while others
are synthesis items that assess either understanding of the
broader concept addressed in the module or the ability to solve
problems by combining knowledge, skills, and understanding.


Similar to the Mid-Module Assessment tasks, the End-ofModule tasks should be completed independently by students
within one class period. These tasks should also be new to the
students and not preceded by analogous problems.

_Note: Question & Test Interoperability (QTI) files are provided for the implementation of digital assessments aligned to each print Mid-_
_and End-of-Module Assessment Task. It is recommended to administer either the print or the digital assessment method of the Mid- and_
_End-of-Module Assessment. Students should not take both assessment types. For grades 1–5, there are many problem types that students_
_could encounter on digital assessments: multiple-choice, multiselect, text entry/equation editor, graphing, inline choice, hot spot, drag_
_and drop, and fractional model. For grade K, the digital assessments have fewer item types and are designed to be teacher-directed and_
_delivered one-on-one with students._


**Responding to Trends in Student Performance**


Once scores are obtained by using the Progression Toward Proficiency rubric, teachers can identify trends,
and use the coherent structure of these instructional materials to respond to student performance. Topics
are clearly labeled with focus standards that help teachers quickly identify materials, problems, and other
resources for supporting students in small groups or individually.


Prior to delivering and analyzing the End-of-Module Assessment Task, teachers may review the Collaboratively
Troubleshooting Student Misconceptions resource, a pre-emptive tool for understanding trends in student
performance and uncovering a need for building foundational or conceptual knowledge fundamental to
success on the problems represented in the trend. The coherence across grade levels makes discovering
relevant fundamental knowledge easier, as teachers can refer to the Student Misconception resources


Program and Implementation Guide **41**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


in earlier grades and implement those supports with their students. The section covering student
misconceptions can be found in each module’s overview.


Finally, use the Additional Days School Year (ADSY) module, one for each grade level, which includes 3 days
reserved for flexible use (i.e., flex days) to give students an extra push with content that needs reinforcement.
Each ADSY lesson reviews a specific TEKS, chosen strategically based on its coherence with the mathematical
understandings that span grade levels. ADSY lessons are supplemental to the core instructional materials, and
topics can be taught independently based on students’ needs. The instructional days can be scheduled at any
point throughout the school year, so consider using these days to focus on those TEKS that need review.


**Assessment Reflection Tool**


An assessment reflection can be a powerful tool in helping to surface student thinking and helping students
to monitor and track their growth. It can also help students anticipate and process any stress or fear they may
have about an assessment.


This assessment reflection tool, found in the Course Guide for each grade level, can help teachers guide discussions
both prior to and after an assessment. These discussions help the teacher promote a culture of productive struggle
as students go into testing. These discussions also support students’ needs after testing and give students the
opportunity to reflect on their new understandings and learn from their mistakes after an assessment.


**Support for Emergent Bilingual Students**


These instructional materials have built-in support that is needed for emergent bilingual (EB) students to
engage with the language-rich lessons. Each lesson’s four-part lesson design has the goal of supporting
the expectations outlined in the English Language Proficiency Standards (ELPS) by including the embedded
instructional best practices noted in previous sections, paired with linguistic accommodations for building
vocabulary and linguistic accommodations for building comprehension and knowledge.


**How the Embedded Instructional Best Practices Support EB Students**


The four-part lesson design infuses these instructional best practices:


⬛
Present the mathematics as a coherent, systematic story.


⬛
Use formative and summative assessment practices to identify student misconceptions and provide
timely feedback.


⬛
Provide multiple entry points to the mathematics, illustrate in multiple modes and formats, and provide opportunities for active processing time and strategic review.


As Ramirez and Celedón-Pattichis state in their book _Beyond Good Teaching: Advancing Mathematics_
_Education for ELLs_, “These practices expand what we know about good teaching because they specifically
address the language demands of students who are developing skill in listening, speaking, reading,
and writing in a second language while learning mathematics.” [38] These instructional best practices are
supported by language development research to address the lesson’s language demands strategically and
systematically. These practices support teachers in deciding on an appropriate comprehensible input for EB


38 Ramirez and Celedón-Pattichis. _Beyond Good Teaching_, p. 1.


**42** Program and Implementation Guide


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


students, work to lower EB students’ affective filter, and help students’ metalinguistic monitoring during
knowledge acquisition and language output. [39] When teachers leverage these best practices while addressing
the topic’s ELPS, EB students experience a language-rich, safe, supported environment in which to learn
mathematics and English.


_Linguistic Accommodations for EB Students to Build Vocabulary_


Linguistic accommodations for building vocabulary are built into the instructional design of the materials. In
addition, the educative nature of the instructional materials support teachers with implementing linguistic
accommodations to build vocabulary. Module Overviews offer teachers a comprehensive list of new or
recently introduced terms and familiar terms and symbols, often with visuals and cognates, allowing teachers
the opportunity to build or activate background knowledge by previewing or pre-teaching familiar terms to EB
students. [40] Lessons give students experience with a new mathematics concept before naming it with a precise
mathematical term. [41] Teachers are often provided with educative guidance, either in the body of the lesson or
in margin notes, to support EB students in pairing the written term they just experienced with a visual
representation, visual cue, or gesture. [42 43] This provides a scaffold for EB students to use and apply
mathematical language in context.



_Research-Based Language Routine to Support New Key Terms_


A language routine is a structured yet adaptable instructional
activity for amplifying, assessing, and developing students’
language. [44] The predictable format of language routines
serves to lower the affective filter, which allows EB students
to engage with metalinguistic thinking about new key
terms. One language routine that specifically amplifies EB
students’ understanding of new key terms is the Collect and
Display language routine. [45 ] The purpose of the Collect and
Display language routine is to capture students’ oral words
and phrases into a stable, collective reference. The teacher
listens for, and scribes, the language students use during

**Collect and Display Language Routine**


Circulate and listen to student talk
during student-to-student discourse. On
separate note cards, scribe students’
frequently used mathematical words
and phrases. Pair these notes with a
visual: a diagram, a sketch, or a picture
of real items. Display the notes and
visuals, and pair each with a more
precise mathematical term. Refer to the
display often during student-to-student
discourse to support EB students’
application of new key terms in new and
novel situations.



Program and Implementation Guide **43**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5



partner, small group, or whole class discussions by using written
words, diagrams, or pictures. This collection output can be organized,
revoiced, and explicitly connected to new key terms. This routine
provides feedback for students in a way that increases sense-making
and application of new key terms.


_Linguistic Accommodations for EB Students to Build Comprehension_
_and Knowledge_


Teachers will find support with implementing linguistic accommodations
to build comprehension and knowledge. Elements of the Sheltered
Instruction Observation Protocol [46] are applied both in the lesson body
and in margin notes.


⬛
Fluency Practice serves to build or activate background
knowledge, both mathematical knowledge and knowledge of
terminology.


⬛
In Concept Development, students have ample opportunities
for discussion amongst peers, experiencing hands-on activities, visuals, graphic organizers, and models, and interacting
with metacognitive strategies such as think-alouds.


⬛
In Application Problems, students integrate reading, writing, speaking, and listening while practicing new content
knowledge and language.


⬛
In the Student Debrief, teachers review key vocabulary and
students and teachers summarize the new learning of the
lesson while engaging with metacognitive and metalinguistic thinking.


To support language output, teachers can leverage the elements
referenced above through strategically grouping students based
on varied levels of mathematical proficiency or varied levels of
English language proficiency. [47] In every part of the four-part lesson
structure, teachers can encourage students to turn and talk in
their home language. This provides EB students with a chance to
clarify new knowledge and terms in their home language, reducing
cognitive overload. It also serves to lower EB students’ affective
filter, which provides them with a safe space to build comprehension
and knowledge. When teachers encourage a turn and talk before
a whole-class share-out, EB students have an opportunity to orally

**Resources**



Intentionally-designed resources that support teachers, students, and
families. Each resource facilitates and reinforces student learning and
conceptual understanding. A comprehensive list of additional resources
follows.


**Student Editions**

Student materials are available in the _Learn_, _Practice_, _Succeed_ trio. This
series supports differentiation and remediation while keeping student
materials organized and accessible. The _Learn_, _Practice_, and _Succeed_
series also offers coherent—and therefore, more effective—resources
for Response to Intervention (RTI), extra practice, and summer learning.


_**Learn**_


_Learn_ serves as a student’s in-class companion; it’s where they show their

_Learn_ assembles the daily classwork—Application Problems, Exit Tickets,
Problem Sets, templates—in an easily stored and navigated volume.


_**Practice**_


Each lesson begins with a series of energetic, joyous fluency activities,
including those found in _Practice_ . Students who are fluent in their
math facts can become proficient with more material more deeply.
With _Practice_, students build competence in newly acquired skills and
reinforce previous learning in preparation for the next lesson.


Together, _Learn_ and _Practice_ provide students with all the print
materials that they will use for their core math instruction.


_(Note: Grade 4 Module 4 does not have a Practice book as there are no_
_fluency templates required for this module.)_


_**Succeed**_


_Succeed_ enables students to work individually toward proficiency. These
additional problems align lesson by lesson with classroom instruction,
making them ideal for use as homework or extra practice. Each
Problem Set is accompanied by a Homework Helper, a set of worked
examples that illustrate how to solve similar problems when families are
supporting students at home.


Teachers and tutors can use _Succeed_ books from prior grade levels as
consistent tools for filling gaps in foundational knowledge. Students
will thrive and progress more quickly as familiar models facilitate
connections to their current grade-level content.

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5


**Assessments**



The Assessment resource includes a Mid-Module
Assessment Task for most modules and an End-ofModule Assessment Task for each module. The
assessments provide students the opportunity to
show their level of proficiency on the TEKS addressed
within the module. A Progression Toward Proficiency
accompanies each assessment and helps educators
identify and celebrate what the students can already
do and what they need to work on next.


Exit Tickets, located within _Learn_, serve as daily
formative assessment. Problem Sets, located within
_Learn_, Homework, located within _Succeed_, provide
other opportunities for formative assessment, and
the Assessment Reflection Tool found in each Course
Guide provides guidance for students’ next steps for
gaining proficiency with specific content.

The ADSY module, one for each grade level, consists of 25 targeted lessons,
1 pre-test assessment, 1 post-test assessment, and 3 days reserved for
flexible use (i.e., flex days) as determined by local decision. Each ADSY
lesson reviews a specific TEKS, chosen strategically based on its coherence
with the mathematical understandings that span grade levels. Each lesson
builds relational understandings about the big ideas in math and prepares
students to succeed in not only their current grade level, but also in later
years. ADSY lessons are supplemental to the core instructional materials,
and topics can be taught independently based on students’ needs. The
instructional days can be scheduled at any point throughout the school
year, including as a block at the end of the year or
intermittently throughout the year.


**Leader Resources**


**Protocols**





The protocol documents support coaches and administrators in supporting educators to internalize and
maximize their understanding and use of the instructional materials. Each protocol provides a level of depth
that the coach or administrator can explore with teachers as they work collaboratively to fine tune their
practice.


**46** Program and Implementation Guide


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5



**Module Internalization Protocol**


The four-step module internalization process is meant to
help teachers develop an understanding of the underlying
coherence of the module, including the specific TEKS and
ELPS, as well as the progression of the module, and pace
the instruction. Through a guided conversation, coaches and
administrators support teachers as they truly internalize the
knowledge and skills of the module.


**Lesson Internalization Protocol**


The four-step lesson internalization process ensures that
teachers are fully prepared to deliver a lesson that is clear,
well-paced, organized, and structured and adapted for their
classrooms. Coaches and administrators guide teachers
through success criteria, alignment, transitions, differentiation,
and other customizations for each lesson, never compromising
on the rigor of the knowledge and skills.

**Observation Tool**


The Observation Tool is a resource for coaches and administrators
to document specific look-fors while observing teachers’
instruction and implementation of high-quality instructional
materials (HQIM). It is not designed to be an evaluation tool.


**Student Work Analysis Protocol**


Coaches and administrators can use the six-step Student
Work Analysis Protocol to collaboratively analyze
student work samples with the goal of understanding
students’ thinking, identifying strengths and progress
toward proficiency, and determining gaps in skills
and knowledge. Coaches and administrators can also
support teachers in developing a plan to take targeted action
to support students’ development of skills and knowledge in
future instruction.

the Module Overview and annotations created as part of the prework. Read the Topic Overviews. Identify
how the module utilizes the concrete-representational-abstract (CRA) progression to build student learning
from lesson to lesson. Identify new and familiar terminology. Preview the table provided in Collaborative
Troubleshooting to anticipate student misconceptions that might arise in the course of the learning.

 - **Use the Scope and Sequence/Pacing Guide provided by your district.** Note which days you will be teaching the
lessons and administering the assessments.

 - **Reflect:** Why is this module important? How does it connect to the prior modules (if applicable)?





Program and Implementation Guide **49**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Coach Module Internalization Protocol K–5


**Going Deeper**




 - **Prior learning:** Identify content learned in the
previous and/or current grade-level that is
prerequisite for the new learning. This can be found
under the Topic Overview heading “Coherence.”

 - **Future learning:** Make connections using the
information in the “Coherence” section of the Topic
Overview.


**Step 2:** **Know your destination.**




- Determine how the content aligns to and meets the
rigor of the TEKS and ELPS.

- Work with teachers to adjust the scope and
sequence/pacing guide provided by your district
given student needs.




- **Use the Overview of Module Topics and Lesson Objectives and the End-of-Module Assessment** **Task.** Examine
the TEKS and ELPS and how they are included. Complete the End-of-Module Assessment Task and review with

**Protocols**


The protocol documents support educators in
their internalization of the instructional materials
and their understanding of how analysis of
student work can help identify how to support
students in their learning. The processes outlined
in the documents include a study of the alignment
of the standards to the key concepts and skills of
the module.


**Module Internalization Protocol**


The Module Internalization Protocol provides
a step-by-step process for understanding each
module prior to teaching, including what students
will be learning, how students will be assessed,
and the high-level arc of learning. By starting with
module internalization, teachers can understand
how each lesson fits into the big picture prior to
using the Lesson Internalization Protocol.











**64** Program and Implementation Guide


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Implementation Guide K–5



**Lesson Internalization Protocol**


The Lesson Internalization Protocol provides a step-by-step
process for understanding each lesson prior to teaching,
including what students will be learning, how students will
be assessed, and how teachers can support all learners in
meeting the rigor of the instructional materials. By using lesson
internalization, teachers deepen the understanding developed
through the Module Internalization Protocol.


**Student Work Analysis Protocol**


The Student Work Analysis Protocol can be used to analyze
student work samples individually or collaboratively with the goal
of understanding students’ thinking, identifying strengths and
progress toward proficiency, and determining gaps in skills
and knowledge. The protocol also supports the creation of a
plan to take targeted action to support students’ development of
skills and knowledge in future instruction.

















Program and Implementation Guide **65**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Teacher Module Internalization Protocol K–5


**Teacher Module Internalization Protocol**











**Step 1: Understand the big picture.**


   - **Use the Module Overview, Topic Overview, Terminology, and Collaborative Troubleshooting sections.**
Revisit the Module Overview and annotations created as part of the prework. Read the Topic Overviews.
Identify how the module utilizes the concrete-representational-abstract (CRA) progression to build student
learning from lesson to lesson. Identify new and familiar terminology. Preview the table provided in
Collaborative Troubleshooting to anticipate student misconceptions that might arise in the course of the
learning.

   - **Use the Scope and Sequence/Pacing Guide provided by your district.** Note which days you will be teaching
the lessons and administering the assessments.

   - **Reflect:** Why is this module important? How does it connect to prior modules (if applicable)?


**Step 2: Know your destination.**


   - **Use the Overview of Module Topics and Lesson Objectives and the End-of-Module Assessment Task.**
Examine the TEKS and ELPS and how they are included. Complete the End-of-Module Assessment Task and
review with strategies in the exemplars using the “A Progression Toward Proficiency” rubric. Identify critical
knowledge and skills for the assessment.

   - **Reflect:** What models, strategies, or terminology are critical for student success on the assessment?


**66** Program and Implementation Guide


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Teacher Module Internalization Protocol K–5


**Step 3: Examine the arc of learning.**


   - **Use the Module Overview, Topic Overviews, and Assessments.** Make connections between the topics and
assessments as students progress in the module. Skim the lesson objectives to understand how lessons build
upon one another.

   - **Use the Terminology and Suggested Tools and Representations.** Begin to consider how all students will
access grade-level content.

   - **Reflect:** How does the math in the arc of learning move from simple to complex?


**Step 4: Organize your resources.**


   - **Use the Module Overview and Suggested Tools and Representations.** Locate materials listed. Identify
additional supplies needed.


Program and Implementation Guide **67**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Teacher Lesson Internalization Protocol K–5


**Teacher Lesson Internalization Protocol**











**Step 1: Understand the lesson purpose and objectives.**


**Use the lesson and Topic Overview.**

   - Read the lesson objective and connect to the Topic Overview, TEKS, and ELPS.

   - Complete the Problem Set and Exit Ticket from a student perspective.

   - Identify knowledge and skills that students build in the lesson.


**Step 2: Understand the sequence and pacing of activities.**


**Use the lesson.**

   - Review the overall flow of the lesson and connection to the objective and Exit Ticket.

   - Plan for pacing of each activity and transitions between components.


**Step 3: Prepare to teach each activity with an activity deep dive.**


**Use the lesson.**

   - Examine how each lesson component (Fluency, Application Problem, Concept Development, Problem Set,
Student Debrief, Exit Ticket) builds to support the learning objective of the topic/lesson.

   - Determine the most critical takeaways from each key component and make instructional decisions for lesson
delivery aligned to the purpose of each component.

   - Create or identify exemplar and example responses to questions and tasks.

   - Examine embedded supports and select the appropriate supports to use in the lesson for diverse learners
(emergent bilingual, gifted and talented, and students with disabilities).


**Step 4: Organize your resources.**


**Use the lesson and Suggested Tools and Representations.**

   - Locate manipulatives or materials listed.

   - Identify additional supplies needed using the “Notes on Multiple Means of Engagement” boxes in the
margins to offer customizations/supports for groups of students.

**Student Work Analysis Protocol Teacher Guide**











The protocol below can be used by individual teachers or groups. If you’re short on time, **prioritize the essential**
**questions that are in bold.**


**Step 1: Discuss the task, related text, and standards.**


1. Examine the task by considering the questions below.


**Essential Questions**


 - **What are students being asked to do and understand in this task?**

 - What knowledge and vocabulary do students need to access this task?

 - Which standards are being assessed through this task? Is this standard addressed in its entirety, or are other
aspects of it taught in the current module/unit or later in the year?

 - For literacy-based tasks, including word problems: What will be challenging about this text for students? Where
will they likely struggle?


Program and Implementation Guide **69**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Student Work Analysis Protocol Teacher Guide K–5


**Step 2: Determine the success criteria for the tasks.**


1. Examine the resources available in your instructional materials, including rubrics and exemplars to develop a
deep understanding of what proficiency of the task looks like.
2. List the key components of the ideal student response.


**Essential Questions**


**Establish a shared understanding of the criteria for fully, partially, and not yet meeting expectations.**

 - **Fully meeting expectations:** What are the key understandings demonstrated in an ideal answer?

 - **Partially meeting expectations:** What differences are there between the student work in the fully and partially
meeting expectation groups?

 - **Not yet meeting expectations:** What foundational understandings are students still developing?


**Step 3:** **Analyze and sort student work.**


1. Independently identify one student response that demonstrates proficiency then discuss why you selected them.
2. Identify categories to sort student work (levels of proficiency, different solution types).
3. Collaboratively or independently sort the student work into these categories. If working with your teammates,
ensure you’re operating from a common lens.


**Essential Questions**


 - **What can students do? What can they not do yet?**

 - Which patterns (both successes and struggles) exist across student work samples within this group?

 - What differentiates those who fully met the success criteria for the task from those who didn’t?


**Step 4:** **Discussion and analysis.**


1. Identify 1-2 major trends for each category.
2. If working in a group, start by discussing someone’s examples or trends across classrooms for a category.


**Essential Questions**


 - What are the students’ strengths, areas for growth, and trends in understanding?

 - What are the most frequent and fundamental challenges and/or misconceptions that students appear to have?

 - **What does the evidence from student responses reveal?**

 - **What happened during the lesson that may have led to bright spots or areas for growth?**


**70** Program and Implementation Guide


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** Student Work Analysis Protocol Teacher Guide K–5


**Step 5: Determine action steps for whole group and sub-groups.**


1. Identify areas of focus for upcoming instruction.
2. If necessary, determine the appropriate adjustments to make to upcoming instruction, both short-term (the next

1-2 lessons) and long-term (later in the unit or future units).


**Essential Questions**


 - **Based on the analysis above, what whole-class or sub-group instructional adjustments will you make? Which**
**aspects of upcoming lessons will you prioritize?**

 - As you are internalizing upcoming lessons and units, where do you see opportunities to address misconceptions
and extend learning?

 - **Looking ahead: What is the next sample of student work you want to collect to monitor progress?**

**Learn** _,_ **Practice** _,_ **and** **Succeed** **Books**


Families can use the student work in the _Learn_, _Practice_, and _Succeed_ books as a conversation point with
teachers to determine their students’ success with mathematical concepts and find ways to support and
extend learning at home, including extra practice and opportunities for summer learning.


_**Learn**_


_Learn_ includes daily classwork: Application Problems, Exit Tickets, Problem Sets, and Templates.


_**Practice**_


Sprint activities are easily replicated at home for extra practice, and students who are fluent in their math
facts can become proficient with more material more deeply. Practice problems can be revisited, discussed, or
re-worked at home as well.


_**Succeed**_


The _Succeed_ book enables students to work individually toward proficiency. These additional problem sets
align lesson by lesson with classroom instruction, making them ideal for use as homework or extra practice.
Each Homework is accompanied by a Homework Helper, a set of worked examples that illustrate how to solve
similar problems.


Teachers and tutors can use _Succeed_ books from prior grade levels as consistent tools for filling gaps
in foundational knowledge. Students will thrive and progress more quickly as familiar models facilitate
connections to their current grade-level content.
