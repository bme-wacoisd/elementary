**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 1


**Introduction**

Welcome to the Grade 1 Course Guide. This guide is designed to give Grade 1 teachers specific knowledge
about the structure of the instructional materials to help them effectively transition into the program.
Included in this guide is information about standards, assessment tools, the focus of each module, and ways
for families to support students at home. This guide also provides background on the developmental advances
that affect how students learn in Grade 1 and practical strategies for troubleshooting misconceptions
collaboratively with students.


**Profile of a Grade 1 Math Learner**

Kindergarten and Grade 1 cover an exciting period of child development. Students’ individual math abilities
are rapidly changing, growing, and connecting in ways that can have a powerful influence on their learning
of mathematics. To be successful with the instructional materials, students’ motor, reading, one-to-one
correspondence, communication, self-regulation, and peer interaction skills need to be coordinated.

It is possible that students may misunderstand or solve problems incorrectly because one or more of the
requisite skills are still developing. For example, students with developing motor skills may need support
manipulating tiles during activities designed to teach arrays. Their emerging reasoning and estimation skills
can make it challenging for them to make bigger numbers from smaller numbers, and vice versa. Students
in Kindergarten and 1 are also developing their ability to read. This can sometimes make interacting with
numbers in word problems or stories more challenging for students. Due to the developing skills needed for
self-regulation, students at these grade levels may find it hard to solve multi-step problems or to take turns
listening and speaking with peers and teachers. Teachers help these students develop foundational skills,
such as number sense, arithmetic, and problem-setting. These skills prepare students for more complex and
representational math introduced later in the instructional materials. Thus, it is important for teachers to
analyze students’ problem-solving strategies to accurately gauge students’ understanding and to use this
information to tailor instruction appropriately.

The modules in the _Bluebonnet Learning_ _K–5 Math_ instructional materials are intentionally designed to
effectively help teachers in Kindergarten and Grade 1 analyze students’ thinking. The _Bluebonnet Learning_
_K–5 Math_ instructional materials activities support students’ developmental needs by identifying potential
student misconceptions and providing guidance to address these misconceptions. This ensures that students
can move away from an algorithmic, rule-based version of math—which can often lead them astray as the
concepts become more complex—toward a more holistic competence with mathematical reasoning.

For students to benefit from the _Bluebonnet Learning_ _K–5 Math_ instructional materials approach, they need
to be provided with opportunities to engage in productive struggle. This means that students boldly and
confidently learn to confront mistakes, reframe them into learning opportunities, and then move forward,
deepening their mathematical reasoning throughout the year. One of the best ways to encourage students
to embrace productive struggle is to promote a classroom culture of learning. A culture of learning is one
in which students embrace the process of productive struggle. It is also a culture free from the common
idea that “fast at math = good at math.” By creating a culture of learning and encouraging students to view
challenges as an expected and even desirable part of the learning process, teachers can help students avoid
a fear of math that could undermine the mathematical future of many students. Instead, students can start
enjoying and feeling confident in math even if their answers do not always come quickly.

**Collaboratively Troubleshooting Student Misconceptions**

It is common for students to make mistakes as they build their understanding of new or difficult concepts.
From a student perspective, mistakes can logically occur whenever students try to apply previous learning to
new problems that require a different approach. To help students correct their thinking and develop a better
understanding, teachers can identify the knowledge that students are building on when they make a mistake.

The _Bluebonnet Learning_ _K–5 Math_ instructional materials list common student mistakes for each module.
Teachers can use this information to troubleshoot mistakes collaboratively with students.

As noted in the Program and Implementation Guide, _collaborative troubleshooting_ is a routine to help
teachers address students’ misconceptions. The three steps to collaborative troubleshooting are

(1) surface student thinking;

(2) validate what the student did right; and

(3) bridge to a better understanding.

In Step 1, it’s helpful to ask questions to better understand what the student was thinking when they made a
decision. For example, the teacher can ask, “Can you tell me more about your thinking on this problem?”
or “I noticed you wrote ____. What were some of your reasons for doing that?”

In Step 2, it’s helpful to point out the parts of the problem that the student understood or did correctly. That
way, the student maintains their successful thinking as they retry a problem. For example, teachers can say,
“I noticed you did ____ and wrote ____, and that’s great because that means you understood ____.”

Last, in Step 3, the teacher can build on the student’s assets and bridge to a better understanding. It can help
to ask guided questions that invite the student to build a stronger understanding. For example, the teacher
can ask the following questions:


⬛
“If you keep ____ [correct thinking] and changed ____ [misconception] to ____ [alternative], then
what do you think might happen?”


⬛
“What would happen if you did ____ instead of ____?”


⬛
“If ____ [correct thinking] is true, then how does that thinking affect ____ [misconception]?”

In practice, this routine may look and sound like the following teacher–student dialogue, which is based on a
misconception for Grade 1 Module 1 Topic D that is listed in the Module Overview.

_Note: Teachers can adapt this sample dialogue to other misconceptions listed in the Module Overview._

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 1


**Scenario:** A student relies on counting all to find the total. The student believes they must count each object
shown or start the count from 1 instead of counting on from recognizable parts. The teacher has a one-on-one
discussion with the student.


**Step 1: Surface student thinking.**

T **:** How do you know that 6 plus 3 equals 9?
S: I count both parts: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, (pause), 7, 8, 9.


**Step 2: Validate what the student did right.**

T: You are right. 6 plus 3 equals 9. What number sentence can we use to represent this work?
S: 6 + 3 = 9.
T: (Write the number sentence.)


**Step 3: Bridge to a better understanding.**

T: What parts did you join together?
S: 6 and 3.
T: Which part is greater?
S: 6.
T: Let’s use a number card to help us know what number to start with.
(Show the numeral card.)
T: How many more do we need to count on?
S: 3.
T: (Place the dot card next to the numeral card). Use the cards to count on.
Touch and count, starting from 6.
S: Siiiix (touch 6), 7, 8, 9. (Touch each dot as it is counted).
T: What do you notice about the cards?
S: I see 6 and 3 more dots. It matches the number sentence.
T: Yes! We started with 6 and counted on 3 more. The cards represent 6 + 3.
T: How is counting on more efficient than starting at 1?
S: Counting on is faster. When we count on, we don’t have to say all the numbers.

**Assessment Reflection Tool**

An assessment reflection can be powerful in helping to surface student thinking and in helping students to
monitor and track their own growth. It can also help students anticipate and process any thoughts they may
have about completing an assessment.

The Assessment Reflection Tool can help teachers guide discussions both prior to and after an assessment.
These discussions help the teacher promote a culture of productive struggle as students go into testing. These
discussions also support students’ needs after testing and give students the opportunity to reflect on their
progress and learn from their mistakes after an assessment.

**Sequence of Grade 1 Modules Aligned with the TEKS**

Module 1: Sums and Differences to 10
Module 2: Introduction to Place Value Through Addition and Subtraction Within 20
Module 3: Ordering and Comparing Length Measurements as Numbers
Module 4: Place Value, Comparison, Addition and Subtraction to 40
Module 5: Identifying, Composing, and Partitioning Shapes
Module 6: Place Value, Comparison, Understanding Income with Addition and Subtraction to 100


**Summary of Year**

Grade 1 mathematics is about (1) developing understanding of addition, subtraction, and strategies for
addition and subtraction within 20; (2) developing understanding of whole number relationships and place
value, including grouping in a hundred, tens and ones; (3) developing understanding of linear measurement
and measuring lengths as iterating length units; and (4) composing, decomposing, and reasoning about
attributes of geometric shapes.


**Rationale for Module Sequence in Grade 1**

In Grade 1, work with numbers to 10 continues to be a major stepping stone in learning the place value
system. In Module 1, students work to further understand the meaning of addition and subtraction, largely
within the context of Grade 1 word problem types. Students intentionally and energetically begin building
fluency with addition and subtraction facts—a major gateway to later grades.



begins by modeling adding and subtracting across ten in
word problems and with equations. Solutions involving
decomposition and composition, like the example for
8 + 5 to the right shows, reinforce the need to make 10. In
Module 1, students grouped 10 objects, saw numbers 0 to

from ten. They now transition to conceptualizing ten as a
single unit (e.g., by using 10 linking cubes joined together).
This transition is the next major stepping stone in
understanding place value—learning to group 10 ones as
a single unit, 1 ten. Learning to complete a unit empowers
students in later grades to understand renaming in the addition algorithm, to mentally add numbers like 298
and 35 (i.e., 298 + 2 + 33), and to add measurements like 4 m, 80 cm, and 50 cm (i.e., 4 m + 80 cm + 20 cm +
30 cm = 4 m + 1 m + 30 cm = 5 m 30 cm).











Module 3, which focuses on measuring to compare lengths by iterating both standard and non-standard
length units, gives students a few weeks to practice and internalize making a 10 during daily fluency activities.
Students will first measure with standard units, such as centimeter cubes, before measuring with nonstandard units, such as paper clips. Emphasizing non-standard units too early may defeat the purpose it is
intended to achieve by interfering with students’ development of basic measurement concepts (such as
no gaps, no overlaps), which are required to understand the need for standard units. The final topic of this

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 1


module provides students the opportunity to apply their addition and subtraction strategies as they represent
and interpret data sets.

Module 4 returns to understanding place value. Addition and subtraction within 40 rest on firmly establishing
a ten as a unit that can be counted, which is first introduced at the end of Module 2. Students begin to see a
problem like 23 + 6 as an opportunity to separate the 2 tens in 23 and concentrate on the familiar addition
problem 3 + 6. So, students further recognize that adding numbers like 28 and 5 is related to adding 8 and 5;
5 is first decomposed into 3 and 2, 2 completes a unit of ten, and then 3 more is added to find the total of 33.

In Module 5, students think about attributes of shapes and practice composing and decomposing geometric
shapes. They also practice working with addition and subtraction during daily fluency activities. This module is
strategically placed between two intense number-based modules to provide students with time to internalize
learning. The module placement also gives more spatially-oriented students the opportunity to build their
confidence before they return to arithmetic.

Module 6 builds on the place value understanding from previous modules. Students extend their
understanding of tens and ones to mentally find 10 more and 10 less, compare numbers to 100, and count
and write numbers to 120. They name a hundred as a new place value unit and compose and decompose
numbers within 120 by using both concrete and pictorial representations. Students identify coins and their
values, apply their understanding of tens and ones to explore decomposition of coins, and add a mixed set
of coins. They also explore income and gifts, spending and saving, needs and wants, and charitable giving.
Students will continue their work of adding and subtracting within 20 in the context of financial literacy. At
the end of this module, students work with varied problem types. These include the challenging _compare with_
_bigger or smaller unknown_ problems, in which the words _more_ and _less_ suggest the incorrect operation.

|**Knowledge and Skills**|Students learn about addition and subtraction up to 20.<br>They use strategies such as_count on_, _make ten_, and_take_<br>_from ten_ to solve addition and subtraction problems with<br>teen numbers. Students will:<br>• Solve addition problems with addends of 7, 8, and<br>9 using the_make ten_ strategy, which involves breaking<br>apart the smaller number before adding to make a unit<br>of ten. For example, 9 + 4 can be thought of as 9 + 1 +<br>3 and, finally, 10 + 3.<br>• Determine whether it is more efficient to use counting<br>on or the_make ten_ strategy to solve an addition problem.<br>• Solve word problems involving three addends<br>(numbers).<br>• Change the order of addends in an addition problem<br>to make ten<br>(for example, 1 + 5 + 9 = 9 + 1 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15).<br>• Subtract 7, 8, and 9 from teen numbers using the_take_<br>_from ten_ strategy, which involves breaking apart the<br>larger number before subtracting from a unit of ten. For<br>example, 16 – 9 can be thought of as 6 + 10 – 9, and,<br>finally, 6 + 1.<br>• Solve word problems involving subtraction of 9 from<br>10 ones to make a simpler problem.<br>• Use 5-group formations (rows) and number bonds<br>to model subtracting 7, 8, and 9 from teen numbers.<br>• Solve a variety of word problems using addition and<br>subtraction strategies.<br>• Work to understand the equal sign and solve equivalent<br>expressions to make true number sentences.<br>• Learn about a unit made from 10 ones and name it a ten.<br>• Understand that teen numbers are made of a ten and<br>some ones (e.g., 11 is 1 ten and 1 one; 12 is 1 ten and<br>2 ones) and apply this new knowledge when solving<br>addition and subtraction problems.|

|**Knowledge and Skills**|Students are introduced to the idea of measuring with<br>a length unit, gaining a new level of precision with the<br>concepts of_longer than_and_shorter than_. They measure<br>the length of objects using standard length units, such<br>as centimeter cubes, and nonstandard length units, such<br>as paper clips. To close out the module, students engage<br>in an exploration of data collections and interpretation.<br>Students will:<br>• Place centimeter cubes end to end along the length<br>of an object with no gaps or overlaps, learning that the<br>total number of cubes represents the length of that<br>object in centimeters.<br>• Compare lengths by using statements such as, “The<br>pencil measures 10 centimeters. The crayon measures<br>6 centimeters. So, the pencil is longer than the crayon.”<br>• Order objects from shortest to longest before and after<br>measuring them.<br>• Understand the usefulness and importance of using<br>same-sized length units when measuring.<br>• Measure objects using nonstandard units (e.g., paper<br>clips and toothpicks) and answer questions such as, “If<br>Bailey uses paper clips and Maya uses toothpicks and<br>they both measure the same items in our classroom,<br>will they be able to compare their measurements?”<br>• Solve word problems related to length.<br>• Learn how to collect data, organize the data in graphs<br>and tables, and interpret the data.<br>• Use tally marks as an efficient counting strategy.<br>• Ask and answer questions about data presented<br>in graphs and tables.<br>• Solve word problems about sets of data.|

|**Knowledge and Skills**|Students explore two- and three-dimensional geometric<br>shapes, identifying their attributes as they describe, sort,<br>and classify shapes. They explore how smaller shapes can<br>be combined to create new, larger shapes. Students also<br>discover how shapes can be partitioned, or divided, into<br>equal parts such as halves, fourths, or quarters. Students<br>come to understand that the more equal parts they use<br>to make a whole, the smaller the parts become. They<br>connect their understanding of halves to telling time<br>to the hour and to the half hour. Students will:<br>• Reason about differences between examples and<br>non-examples of various shapes to clarify each shape’s<br>defining attributes.<br>• Find and name two- and three-dimensional shapes<br>based on defining attributes.<br>• Create composite shapes from two- and three-<br>dimensional shapes and name the smaller shapes that<br>form the larger whole.<br>• Identify parts of composite shapes as equal or unequal,<br>and name two equal parts of a whole as halves and four<br>equal parts of a whole as quarters, or fourths.<br>• Make a paper clock by partitioning a circle and using<br>their understanding of halves to tell time to the hour<br>and to the half hour.<br>• Tell time on both analog and digital clocks.|

**Tips for Families**

**Key Concepts Overview**

Focus TEKS: **1.2A, 1.3B, 1.3C, 1.3D, 1.3E, 1.3F, 1.5D, 1.5E, 1.5F, 1.5G**

The focus of Module 1 is to add and subtract numbers to 10. In this module, the emphasis is on progressing
toward fluency with addition and subtraction. Your student will:

⬜ Learn how to break apart a total into two parts, or **addends**, and begin to understand that a number
can be broken apart in multiple ways.

⬜ Use number bonds and addition **expressions** to model how two parts make a total.

⬜ Connect mathematics to real-world situations by making sense of problems, and by choosing and
applying tools and strategies to solve problems when one addend is **unknown.**

⬜ Use 5-group cards to **track** the count as they **count on** from one addend to the total.

⬜ Focus on the equal sign and the position of addends in an equation to count on from the larger number.

⬜ Recognize **doubles** and **doubles plus 1** as they analyze an addition chart to find patterns and
structures (such as 5-groups, plus ones, doubles, sums equal to 10, etc.).

⬜ Relate addition to subtraction with the use of missing addends.

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages
in the Succeed Student Edition to help you support your student as they work at home.


**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Play the game “Penny Parts” with your student. Invite your student to organize a group of 6 to 10
pennies into two groups, placing 5 pennies in one group. Then ask your student to draw a number
bond that shows how the pennies are grouped. For example, if the total is 8 pennies, then the parts
are 5 and 3. For an added challenge, separate the pennies two different ways with the same total and
draw a number bond to match each way; for example, 5 and 3, and 4 and 4.


⬛
Invite your student to use toys (such as building blocks), cereal pieces, or pennies to show the parts
of a number that make a total. For example, 6 red cubes and 3 blue cubes make 9 cubes. Challenge
your student to draw a number bond to match each combination.


⬛
Play the game “Count On Cheers” with your student. Say a number aloud, such as, 5. Invite your student to repeat the number while touching his head, then counting on as he raises his hands in the air,
one at a time.


⬛
Play the game “Missing Part” with your student. Use 5-group cards or homemade numeral cards
from 0–10. Player A places a card against her forehead without looking at the number on the card.
Player B tells how many more to make 10. Then, player A guesses the number on the card. Take turns
playing each role. If needed, remind your student to use fingers to count on.


**35**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 1


⬛
Play the game “What’s the Difference?” with your student. Two players place a deck of playing cards
between them, facedown. Each player flips over two cards and subtracts the smaller number from
the larger number. The player with the smallest difference keeps all four cards played in that round.
The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.
(NOTE: Face cards are equivalent to 10, or you can remove them from the deck before playing. Aces
are equivalent to 1.)


**Terms**

**Addend** : one of the numbers being added


**Count on** : count up from one part to the total


**Doubles** ( _Dobles_ ): an addition number sentence or expression where both addends are the same number

**Doubles plus 1:** an addition number sentence or expression that starts with doubles and adds 1 more


**Expression** ( _Expresión_ ): a number sentence without an equal sign


**36**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 1


**Track** : use different objects to track counting on from one addend to the total


**Unknown:** the missing number that completes a true number sentence

**Formas Adicionales De Ayudar En Casa**


⬛
Juegue a “Piezas de un centavo” con su estudiante. Invite a su estudiante a organizar un grupo de 6 a 10
centavos en dos grupos, colocando 5 centavos en un grupo. Luego, pídale a su estudiante que dibuje un
enlace numérico que muestre cómo se agrupan los centavos. Por ejemplo, si el total es de 8 centavos,
entonces las partes son 5 y 3. Para un reto adicional, separe los centavos de dos maneras diferentes con
el mismo total y dibuje un enlace numérico para que coincida con cada forma; por ejemplo, 5 y 3, y 4 y 4.


⬛
Invite a su estudiante a usar juguetes (como bloques de construcción), piezas de cereales o monedas
de un centavo para mostrar las partes de un número que hacen un total. Por ejemplo, 6 cubos rojos
y 3 cubos azules hacen 9 cubos. Rete a su estudiante a dibujar un enlace numérico para que coincida
con cada combinación.


⬛
Juegue a “Conteo alegre” con su estudiante. Diga un número en voz alta, como 5. Invite a su estudiante a repetir el número mientras se toca la cabeza, luego cuente mientras levanta las manos en
el aire, una a la vez.

⬛
Juegue a “Pieza faltante” con su estudiante. Use tarjetas de grupos de 5 o tarjetas numéricas hechas
en casa del 0 al 10. El jugador A coloca una carta contra su frente sin mirar el número de la carta. El
jugador B dice cuántos más para llegar a 10. Luego, el jugador A adivina el número de la carta. Tomen
turnos para desempeñar cada papel. Si es necesario, recuerde a su estudiante que use los dedos para
contar.


⬛
Juegue a “¿Cuál es la diferencia?” con su estudiante. Dos jugadores colocan una baraja de cartas
entre ellos, boca abajo. Cada jugador voltea dos cartas y resta el número más pequeño del número
más grande. El jugador con la diferencia más pequeña se queda con las cuatro cartas jugadas en esa
ronda. Vence el jugador con más cartas al final del juego. (NOTA: las cartas con cara equivalen a 10, o
puede retirarlas del mazo antes de jugar. Los ases equivalen a 1).

In Module 2, students learn about addition and subtraction up to 20. They use strategies such as _count on_,
_make ten_, and _take from ten_ to solve addition and subtraction problems with teen numbers. Your student will:

⬜ Solve addition problems with addends of 7, 8, and 9 using the _make ten_ strategy, which involves
breaking apart the smaller number before adding to make a unit of ten. For example, 9 + 4 can be
thought of as 9 + 1 + 3 and, finally, 10 + 3.

⬜ Determine whether it is more efficient to use counting on or the _make ten_ strategy to solve an addition problem.

⬜ Solve word problems involving three addends (numbers).

⬜ Change the order of addends in an addition problem to make ten (for example, 1 + 5 + 9 = 9 + 1 + 5 =
10 + 5 = 15).

⬜ Subtract 7, 8, and 9 from teen numbers using the _take from ten_ strategy, which involves breaking
apart the larger number before subtracting from a unit of ten. For example, 16 – 9 can be thought of
as 6 + 10 – 9, and, finally, 6 + 1.

⬜ Solve word problems involving subtraction of 9 from 10 ones to make a simpler problem.

⬜ Use 5-group formations (rows) and number bonds to model subtracting 7, 8, and 9 from teen numbers.

⬜ Solve a variety of word problems using addition and subtraction strategies.

⬜ Work to understand the equal sign and solve equivalent **expressions** to make true number sentences.

⬜ Learn about a unit made from 10 ones and name it **a** **ten** .

⬜ Understand that teen numbers are made of a ten and some ones (e.g., 11 is 1 ten and 1 one; 12 is
1 ten and 2 ones) and apply this new knowledge when solving addition and subtraction problems.

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages
in the Succeed Student Edition to help you support your student as they work at home.


**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Play the game “Take Out 1” with your student. Say a number up to 10 (e.g., 6). Invite your student to
write a number bond quickly, using 1 as a part (1 and 5). Once your student is confident taking out 1,
move on to taking out 2 or 3.


⬛
Play a game to practice making ten. Use the 7, 8, and 9 cards from a deck of cards. Player A flips over
a card (e.g., 7). The first player to call out the amount needed to make ten keeps the card. The player
who has the most cards after all cards are flipped wins the round. The winning player gets to shuffle
and flip the cards in the next round. Take turns with your student being Player A.


**41**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 1


⬛
Play another game with the 7, 8, and 9 cards from a deck of cards. You call out a teen number (e.g.,
13) and then turn over a card (e.g., 7). Your student then says the number sentences that add up to
13, first by making ten and then by adding on the ones (7 + 3 = 10; 10 + 3 = 13). Switch roles after
every turn and call out a different teen number each time.


⬛
Guide your student to practice subtracting 7, 8, and 9 from teen numbers (numbers 11–19) by using
the _take from ten_ strategy. For example, 13 – 7 can become 10 – 7 + 3.


⬛
Write a false number sentence, such as 10 + 3 = 6 + 6. Challenge your student to make the number
sentence true by changing only one number.


⬛
Reinforce place value understanding by breaking apart a teen number (numbers 11–19). Call out a
teen number (e.g., 15). Your student breaks the number into a ten and some ones (1 ten 5 ones).

⬛
Juegue a “Restar 1” con su estudiante. Diga un número hasta 10 (por ejemplo, 6). Invite a su estudiante a escribir un enlace numérico rápidamente, usando 1 como parte (1 y 5). Una vez que su
estudiante esté seguro de restar 1, pase a restar 2 o 3.


⬛
Juegue un juego para practicar haciendo decenas. Use las cartas 7, 8 y 9 de una baraja de cartas. El
jugador A voltea una carta (por ejemplo, 7). El primer jugador que diga la cantidad necesaria para
hacer una decena se queda con la carta. El jugador que tenga más cartas después de voltear todas
las cartas gana la ronda. El jugador ganador puede barajar y voltear las cartas en la siguiente ronda.
Tome turnos con su estudiante siendo el jugador A.


⬛
Jueguen otro juego con las cartas 7, 8 y 9 de una baraja de cartas. Debe decir un número del 11 al 19
(por ejemplo, 13) y luego voltea una tarjeta (por ejemplo, 7). Después, su estudiante dice las oraciones numéricas que sumen 13, primero haciendo decenas y luego sumando las unidades (7 + 3 =
10; 10 + 3 = 13). Cambie de rol después de cada turno y diga un número del 11 al 19 diferente cada
vez.


⬛
Guíe a su estudiante a practicar restando 7, 8 y 9 de los números del 11 al 19 usando la estrategia de

Focus TEKS: **1.3B, 1.5D, 1.7A, 1.7B, 1.7C, 1.7D, 1.8A, 1.8B, 1.8C**

In Module 3, students are introduced to the idea of measuring with a **length unit**, gaining a new level of
precision with the concepts of _longer than_ and _shorter than_ . Students measure the length of objects using
standard length units, such as **centimeter cubes**, and nonstandard length units, such as paper clips. To close
out the module, students engage in an exploration of **data** collections and interpretation. Your student will:

⬜ Place centimeter cubes end to end along the length of an object with no gaps or overlaps, learning
that the total number of cubes represents the length of that object in **centimeters** .

⬜ Compare lengths by using statements such as, “The pencil measures 10 centimeters. The crayon
measures 6 centimeters. So, the pencil is longer than the crayon.”

⬜ Order objects from shortest to longest before and after measuring them.

⬜ Understand the usefulness and importance of using same-sized length units when measuring.

⬜ Measure objects using nonstandard units (e.g., paper clips and toothpicks) and answer questions
such as, “If Bailey uses paper clips and Maya uses toothpicks and they both measure the same items
in our classroom, will they be able to compare their measurements?”

⬜ Solve word problems related to length.

⬜ Learn how to collect data, organize the data in **graphs** and **tables**, and interpret the data.

⬜ Use **tally marks** as an efficient counting strategy.

⬜ Ask and answer questions about data presented in graphs and tables.

⬜ Solve word problems about sets of data.

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages
in the Succeed Student Edition to help you support your student as they work at home.


**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Provide opportunities for your student to measure and compare lengths. They can use a household
item (e.g., a string, an index card, a paper clip) as a measurement tool. Ask your student to use the
words _longer than_, _shorter than_, and _the same length as_ to compare the measured objects (e.g., “My
shoe is four paper clips shorter than Ruthie’s shoe!”).


⬛
Ask your student to order objects from shortest to longest or vice versa. For example, your student
might say, “The couch is longer than the coffee table. The coffee table is longer than the chair. The
order from shortest to longest is chair, coffee table, couch.”


**47**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 1


⬛
When solving word problems where the difference is unknown (e.g., If Sam has 9 apples and Maria
has 12, how many more apples does Maria have than Sam?), encourage your student to share more
than one solution strategy. They might think in terms of addition: Nine plus which mystery number
gives me 12? (3) Alternatively, they might think in terms of subtraction: When I take 9 away from 12,
I get 3.


⬛
Help your student stay sharp with addition and subtraction skills up to 20. Starting at 0, two players
take turns rolling a die, adding the number on the die to the total, and stating the addition number
sentence. For example, player A rolls 6 and says, “0 + 6 = 6.” Partner B rolls 3 and says, “6 + 3 = 9.”
Players continue rolling until they get to 20, without going over. (If the total is 18, for example, players take turns rolling until someone rolls a 2.) Play a similar game with subtraction, starting at 20 and
subtracting each roll of the die until you reach 0.


⬛
Reinforce your student’s place value understanding in preparation for Module 4. With your student,
practice saying numbers the Say Ten way. For example, you say, “43,” and your student says, “4 tens 3.”

En el Módulo 3, se presenta a los estudiantes la idea de medir con una **unidad de longitud**, obteniendo
un nuevo nivel de precisión con los conceptos de _más largo que_ y _más corto que_ . Los estudiantes miden
la longitud de los objetos usando unidades de longitud estándar, como **cubos de centímetros**, y unidades
de longitud no estándar, como clips para papeles. Para cerrar el módulo, los estudiantes participan en una
exploración de la recopilación e interpretación de **datos** . Su estudiante:

⬜ Colocará cubos de centímetros de extremo a extremo a lo largo de la longitud de un objeto sin
espacios ni poniendo uno encima de otro, aprendiendo que el número total de cubos representa la
longitud de ese objeto en **centímetros** .

⬜ Comparará las longitudes usando afirmaciones como: “El lápiz mide 10 centímetros. El crayón mide 6
centímetros. Entonces, el lápiz es más largo que el crayón”.

⬜ Ordenará los objetos del más corto al más largo antes y después de medirlos.

⬜ Entenderá la utilidad e importancia de usar unidades de longitud del mismo tamaño al medir.

⬜ Medirá objetos usando unidades no estándar (por ejemplo, clips para papeles y palillos de dientes)
y responda preguntas como: “Si Bailey usa clips y Maya usa palillos de dientes y ambos miden los
mismos elementos en nuestra clase, ¿podrán comparar sus medidas?”.

⬜ Resolverá problemas de palabras relacionados con la longitud.

⬜ Aprenderá a recopilar datos, organizar los datos en **gráficas** y **tablas**, e interpretar los datos.

**Formas Adicionales De Ayudar En Casa**


⬛
Dé oportunidades para que su estudiante mida y compare longitudes. Pueden usar un artículo
doméstico (por ejemplo, una cuerda, una ficha, un clip) como herramienta de medición. Pídale a su
estudiante que use las palabras _más largo que_, _más corto que_ y _la misma longitud_ que para comparar
los objetos medidos (por ejemplo, “¡Mi zapato es cuatro clips más corto que el zapato de Ruthie!”).


**50**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 1


⬛
Pídale a su estudiante que ordene objetos del más corto al más largo o viceversa. Por ejemplo, su
estudiante podría decir: “El sofá es más largo que la mesa de centro. La mesa de centro es más larga
que la silla. El orden de más corto a más largo es silla, mesa de centro, sofá”.


⬛
Al resolver problemas de palabras donde la diferencia es desconocida (por ejemplo, si Sam tiene 9
manzanas y María tiene 12, ¿cuántas manzanas más tiene María que Sam?), anime a su estudiante a
compartir más de una estrategia de solución. Podrían pensar en términos de suma: ¿nueve más qué
número misterioso me da 12? (3) Alternativamente, podrían pensar en términos de resta: cuando le
quito 9 a 12, obtengo 3.


⬛
Ayude a su estudiante a mantenerse entrenado con competencias de suma y resta de hasta 20.
Comenzando desde 0, dos jugadores se turnan para tirar un dado, sumar el número del dado al total
e indicar la oración del número de suma. Por ejemplo, el jugador A tira 6 y dice: “0 + 6 = 6”. El jugador
B saca 3 y dice: “6 + 3 = 9”. Los jugadores continúan hasta llegar a 20, sin pasarse. (Si el total es 18,
por ejemplo, los jugadores se turnan para rodar hasta que alguien tire un 2). Juegue un juego similar
con resta, comenzando en 20 y restando cada tirada del dado hasta llegar a 0.


⬛
Refuerce la comprensión del valor posicional de su estudiante en preparación para el Módulo 4. Con

In Module 4, students are focusing on the role of place value when adding and subtracting numbers to 40.
Your student will:

⬜ Explore numbers comprised of multiple tens and ones (e.g., 27, 33, 37) using linking cubes, fingers,
dimes and pennies, and the **place value chart** .

⬜ Identify 1 more, 1 less, 10 more, and 10 less than a two-digit number as they learn to add or subtract
like units.

⬜ Use **comparison symbols** greater than (>), less than (<), and equal to (=) to compare quantities.

⬜ Compare numbers from left to right (from the tens place to the ones place) and order numbers using
an **open number line.**

⬜ Learn about adding and subtracting tens using concrete models, **quick tens**, and **number bonds** as
methods for representing their thinking.

⬜ Add one-digit and two-digit numbers by using familiar strategies, such as the _count on_ strategy and
the _make ten_ strategy.

⬜ Begin labeling drawings with numerals and using **strip diagrams** to model word problems with an

**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Play the game “Break Apart Numbers” with your student. Set a timer for one minute. Have a race
with your student to complete as many different number bonds for the numbers 5–9 as possible.
When the minute is up, say a matching number sentence for each bond you completed, for example,
1 + 4 = 5, 5 = 3 + 2, 5 = 5 + 0, and 5 – 1 = 4.


⬛
Practice making tens with pennies and dimes. Help your student arrange ten pennies into 5-groups
(two rows of five). Then count the pennies together (e.g., one cent, two cents, three cents) and say
out loud, “Ten pennies are equal to one dime,” as you exchange 10 pennies for 1 dime. Repeat the
process of counting and exchanging 10 pennies for 1 dime until you have exchanged 40 cents.


⬛
Choose a number up to 40 and invite your student to add 10 or 1 to or subtract 10 or 1 from that
number. For example, if you say, “39, subtract 10,” your student responds, “29.” You might also challenge your student to say the matching number sentence, for example, “39 – 10 = 29.”


**53**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 1


⬛
Play the game “Add Tens Finger Flash” with your student. With your fingers, flash a number (e.g., 6),
and then call out a number of tens to add to that number (e.g., “Add 2 tens.”) Your student says the
number. (26) Then switch roles.


⬛
Write all practice problems horizontally to encourage your student to use mental strategies to solve.

**Formas Adicionales De Ayudar En Casa**


⬛
Juegue a “Descomponer los números” con su estudiante. Ponga un cronómetro para un minuto. Haga
una carrera con su estudiante para completar tantos enlaces numéricos diferentes para los números
5–9 como sea posible. Cuando termine el minuto, diga una oración numérica coincidente para cada
enlace que completó, por ejemplo, 1 + 4 = 5, 5 = 3 + 2, 5 = 5 + 0 y 5 – 1 = 4.


⬛
Practique hacer decenas con centavos y monedas de diez centavos. Ayude a su estudiante a organizar
10 monedas de un centavo en grupos de 5 (dos filas de cinco). Luego, cuenten los centavos juntos
(por ejemplo, un centavo, dos centavos, tres centavos) y diga en voz alta: “10 monedas de un centavo
son iguales a una moneda de 10 centavos”, mientras intercambia 10 monedas de un centavo por 1
moneda de 10 centavos. Repita el proceso de contar e intercambiar 10 monedas de un centavo por 1
moneda de 10 centavos hasta que haya intercambiado 40 centavos.

Grade 1 Module 5
**Tips for Families**

**Key Concepts Overview**

Focus TEKS: **1.6A, 1.6B, 1.6C, 1.6D, 1.6E, 1.6F, 1.6G, 1.6H, 1.7E**

In Module 5, students explore two- and three-dimensional geometric shapes, identifying their attributes as
they describe, sort, and classify shapes. They explore how smaller shapes can be combined to create new,
larger shapes. Students also discover how shapes can be partitioned, or divided, into equal parts such as
halves, fourths, or quarters. Students come to understand that the more equal parts they use to make a
whole, the smaller the parts become. They connect their understanding of halves to telling time to the hour
and to the half hour. Your student will:

⬜ Reason about differences between examples and non-examples of various shapes to clarify each
shape’s defining **attributes** .

⬜ Find and name **two- and three-dimensional shapes** based on defining attributes.

⬜ Create **composite shapes** from two- and three-dimensional shapes and name the smaller shapes that
form the larger whole.

⬜ Identify parts of composite shapes as equal or unequal, and name two equal parts of a whole as
**halves** and four equal parts of a whole as quarters, or **fourths** .

⬜ Make a paper clock by partitioning a circle and using their understanding of halves to tell time to the
**hour** and to the **half hour** .

⬜ Tell time on both analog and **digital clocks** .

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages
in the Succeed Student Edition to help you support your student as they work at home.


**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Play the game “Spot the Shape” with your student. See who can spot the most two-dimensional and
three-dimensional shapes. You can play this game at home or during a trip around town. Challenge
your student to describe the attributes that define the shape as she names it. For example, if your
student sees a cube, she might say, “I see a cube! It has 6 square faces and 8 vertices!”


⬛
Play the game “Guess My Shape” with your student. Ask him to guess a shape you are imagining by
asking yes or no questions. For example, he might ask, “Does it have square corners?” or “Does it
have any faces?” or “Does it have four sides?” or ”Does it have more than four vertices?”


⬛
Play the game “Draw That Shape” with your student. Name a two-dimensional shape (circle, triangle,
square, rectangle, hexagon, rhombus, or trapezoid) for your student to draw. Then ask her to list the
attributes of the shape she drew.


**58**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 1


⬛
Build shapes, animals, designs, or anything else your student desires with the tangram pieces from
the Lesson 8 Homework, allowing him to use his creativity and new knowledge about shapes. As he
places a piece, ask him to tell you about it, naming the shape (e.g., triangle) and its attributes (three
vertices and three sides).


⬛
Look for shapes or objects made from parts and ask your student to determine whether they are
equal parts or unequal parts. For example, when cutting a sandwich, intentionally cut it into two unequal parts to discuss why the two pieces are not called halves. Ask your student how you could have
cut the sandwich to make equal parts.


⬛
Set routines such as bedtime, dinner, or homework time to the hour and half hour so your student
can notice and practice telling time to the hour and to the half hour. For example, challenge your student to consider what time it will be at the end of her one-hour sports practice or half-hour TV show.


**Terms**

**Attributes** ( _Atributos_ ): the things you can see about an object, such as the number of sides and corners,
or vertices


_4 straight sides, 4 corners, or vertices_


**Composite shape** : a shape that is made up of other shapes


**Face** : a flat part of a three-dimensional solid


**59**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 1


**Three-dimensional** ( _Tres dimensiones_ ) **shapes** : solid shapes with faces, edges, and corners or vertices such as

Enfoque de TEKS: **1.6A, 1.6B, 1.6C, 1.6D, 1.6E, 1.6F, 1.6G, 1.6H, 1.7E**

En el Módulo 5, los estudiantes exploran formas geométricas de dos dimensiones y tres dimensiones,
identificando sus atributos a medida que describen y clasifican las formas. Exploran cómo se pueden combinar
formas más pequeñas para crear formas nuevas y más grandes. Los estudiantes también descubren cómo
las formas se pueden dividir en partes iguales, como mitades o cuartos. Los estudiantes llegan a comprender
que, cuantas más partes iguales usan para formar un todo, más pequeñas se vuelven las partes. Conectan su
comprensión de las mitades con decir la hora a la hora y a la media hora. Su estudiante:

⬜ Razonará sobre las diferencias entre ejemplos y no ejemplos de varias formas para aclarar los **atribu-**
**tos** definitorios de cada forma.

⬜ Encontrará y nombrará **formas de dos dimensiones y tres dimensiones** en función de la definición de
atributos.

⬜ Creará **formas compuestas** a partir de formas de dos dimensiones y tres dimensiones y nombrará las
formas más pequeñas que forman el conjunto más grande.

⬜ Identificará las partes de las formas compuestas como iguales o desiguales, y nombra dos partes
iguales de un todo como **mitades** y cuatro partes iguales de un todo como **cuartos** .

⬜ Hará un reloj de papel particionando un círculo y usando su comprensión de las mitades para decir la
hora a la **hora** y a la **media hora** .

⬜ Dirá la hora en los relojes analógicos y **digitales** .

**Formas Adicionales De Ayudar En Casa**


⬛
Juegue a “Descubrir la forma” con su estudiante. Vea quién puede detectar las formas más de dos
dimensiones y tres dimensiones. Puede jugar a este juego en casa o durante un viaje por la ciudad.
Rete a su estudiante a describir los atributos que definen la forma como él la nombra. Por ejemplo,
si su estudiante ve un cubo, podría decir: “¡Veo un cubo! ¡Tiene 6 caras cuadradas y 8 vértices!”.


⬛
Juegue a “Adivina mi forma” con su estudiante. Haciendo preguntas de sí o no, pídale que adivine
una forma que usted está imaginando. Por ejemplo, podría preguntar: “¿Tiene esquinas cuadradas?”

     - “¿Tiene alguna cara?” o “¿Tiene cuatro lados?” o “¿Tiene más de cuatro vértices?”


**61**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 1


⬛
Juegue a “Dibujar esa forma” con su estudiante. Nombre una forma de dos dimensiones (círculo,
triángulo, cuadrado, rectángulo, hexágono, rombo o trapecio) para que su estudiante la dibuje.
Luego, pídale que liste los atributos de la forma que dibujó.


⬛
Construya formas, animales, diseños o cualquier otra cosa que su estudiante desee con las piezas de
tangram de la Tarea de la Lección 8, permitiéndole usar su creatividad y nuevos conocimientos sobre
las formas. Mientras coloca una pieza, pídale que se lo cuente, nombrando la forma (por ejemplo, el
triángulo) y sus atributos (tres vértices y tres lados).


⬛
Busque formas u objetos hechos de partes y pídale a su estudiante que determine si son partes
iguales o partes desiguales. Por ejemplo, al cortar un sándwich, córtelo intencionalmente en dos
partes desiguales para analizar por qué las dos piezas no se llaman mitades. Pregunte a su estudiante
cómo podría haber cortado el sándwich para hacer partes iguales.


⬛
Establezca rutinas como la hora de acostarse, la cena o la hora de la tarea a la hora y media para que
su estudiante pueda notar y practicar decir la hora a la hora y a la media hora. Por ejemplo, rete a
su estudiante a considerar qué hora será al final de su práctica deportiva de una hora o programa de
televisión de media hora.


**Términos**

**Atributos** : las cosas que puede ver sobre un objeto, como el número de lados y esquinas, o vértices.


_4 lados rectos, 4 esquinas o vértices_


**Forma compuesta** : una forma que se compone de otras formas.


**Cara** : una parte plana de un sólido de tres dimensiones.


**62**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 1


**Formas de tres dimensiones** : formas sólidas con caras, bordes y esquinas o vértices, como un cono, un prisma
rectangular o un prisma triangular. Una esfera es una forma de tres dimensiones sin caras planas, sin bordes y
sin vértices.







**Formas de dos dimensiones** : formas planas y cerradas, como un semicírculo, un cuarto de círculo o un rombo.

**1.9B, 1.9C, 1.9D**

In Module 6, students combine their learning from Module 1 through Module 5 to learn the most challenging
Grade 1 standards and celebrate their progress. Students extend their understanding of comparative word
problems and numbers to 120 as well as their tens and ones skills. Students use their knowledge of tens and
ones to explore the values of coins. For example, they might represent 25 cents using 1 quarter, 25 pennies,
2 dimes and 1 nickel, or 1 dime and 15 pennies. Students continue their work adding and subtracting within
20 in the context of financial literacy. Your student will:

⬜ Learn how to use a **double strip diagram** to compare two sets of items and solve word problems.

⬜ Identify numbers to 120 using standard form (e.g., 118) and unit form of tens and ones (e.g., 11 tens
8 ones).

⬜ Use words or comparison symbols >, <, and = to compare numbers and identify 10 more, 10 less,
1 more, and 1 less than a two-digit number.

⬜ Learn to add and subtract multiples of 10 and one-digit numbers, and learn to add two-digit numbers
using concrete and pictorial representations.

⬜ Order whole numbers using place value and open number lines.

⬜ Learn to recognize the **penny**, **nickel**, **dime**, and **quarter**, state the value of each coin, and use the
cent symbol when counting and recording the value of coins.

⬜ Discover the difference between **income** and **gifts**, spending and saving, **needs** and **wants**, and
explore charitable giving.

⬜ Work with varied problem types, sharing and explaining their strategies and reasoning.

**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Read word problems aloud for your student so he can concentrate on visualizing the story.


⬛
Notice and share real-life comparison story problems. For example, you might say, “We have
10 cups. I noticed we have 4 fewer mugs than cups. How many mugs do we have?” or “I see we
have 10 spoons in the drawer. There are 2 more spoons than forks. How many forks do we have?”
Challenge your student to visualize and work through each problem before counting how many to
check her answer.


**64**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 1


⬛
Use coins with your student as much as possible. Spend time noticing the attributes of each coin.
Which coins have smooth edges? Which coins have ridges on the edges? Where is the value of each
coin written? What symbols appear on the coins, and what is the meaning of each symbol?


⬛
Challenge your student to solve sequences of math problems that follow a pattern, starting with a
simple problem. For example, if you start with 5 + 2, you can continue with 15 + 2, 25 + 2, and
35 + 2. Ask your student to tell you what she noticed about the math problems and how knowing
5 + 2 helped her with the other problems.
