**Grade 2 | Foundational Skills 2**
Introduction


~~**UNIT 2 OVERVIEW**~~


In Unit 1, students read words containing the basic code spellings for the five “short” vowel sounds:


  - /i/ > ‘i’ ( _it_ )


  - /e/ > ‘e’ ( _pet_ )


  - /a/ > ‘a’ ( _hat_ )


  - /u/ > ‘u’ ( _but_ )


  - /o/ > ‘o’ ( _hop_ )


Unit 2 is the second of two units that should be largely review for students who were taught this
program last year. In this unit, students will:


  - review a number of spellings they learned in Grade 1, with an emphasis on spellings for vowel sounds


  - read one- and two-syllable words


  - read contractions and provide their noncontracted equivalents


  - practice recognizing a number of high-frequency Tricky Words


  - read decodable stories in the Unit 2 Reader, _Bedtime Tales_


  - learn the use of quotation marks


  - begin instruction in the writing process, with a focus on writing narratives


Introduction
**1**


**Vowel Spellings and Sounds**


In this unit students will review sixteen additional letter-sound correspondences:


     - /ae/ > ‘a_e’ ( _cake_ )


      - /ie/ > ‘i_e’ ( _bite_ )


     - /oe/ > ‘o_e’ ( _home_ )


     - /ue/ > ‘u_e’ ( _cute_ )


     - /ee/ > ‘ee’ ( _bee_ )


     - /ee/ > ‘e_e’ ( _Pete_ )


     - /ee/ > ‘ea’ _(beach_ )


      - /oo/ > ‘oo’ ( _soon_ )


     - /oo/ > ‘oo’ ( _look_ )


     - /ou/ > ‘ou’ ( _shout_ )


     - /ou/ > ‘ow’ ( _now_ )


      - /oi/ > ‘oi’ ( _oil_ )


      - /oi/ > ‘oy’ _(toy_ )


      - /er/ > ‘er’ ( _her_ )


      - /or/ > ‘or’ ( _for_ )


      - /ar/ > ‘ar’ ( _car_ )


The spellings are listed in the order in which they are reviewed and/or introduced. For students who
were in this program last year, these will be a review. For each spelling you review, you will add a
Spelling Card to one of the Code Flip Books.


Foundational Skills 2

~~**MARKING AND POINTING TRICKS**~~


There are some marking and pointing tricks you can use to help students learn to see and process
separated digraphs as single spelling units.


You can draw a horseshoe shape connecting the two letters, like this:


You may also reinforce the connection by using a pointing trick. When pointing to single-letter
spellings or normal digraphs (written with letters side by side), use a single finger. When you point
to a split digraph, pop out a second finger to make a ‘V’, with one finger pointing at the first letter in
the separated digraph and the other pointing at the final letter ‘e’.


Students will also encounter two-syllable words with these spellings. It is important for students to
understand how to chunk multisyllable words into smaller segments that can be decoded. Please
refer to Appendix B for more detailed information.


Additional background information describing how these letter-sound correspondences were used
in Grade 1 is included in Appendix A. It is strongly recommended that you review this information
prior to teaching any lessons in this unit.


Introduction
**3**


~~**TRICKY WORDS**~~


During this unit, students will review the Tricky Words _I_, _you_, _your_, _street_, _my_, _by_, _have_, _all_, _who_, _no_,
_so_, _are_, _were_, _they_, _their_, and _some_ . When reviewing these words, point out which parts of each word
are regular and can be blended and which parts are not regular and simply must
be remembered.


Some of the words presented as Tricky Words are actually part of spelling patterns that will be
reviewed later in this grade and are also covered in the second half of the curriculum for Grade 1.
For example, _my_ and _by_ are examples of /ie/ spelled ‘y’, a spelling that will be reviewed in Unit 4.
Students who had this program in Grade 1 and completed Unit 7 should already know that ‘y’ is a
spelling for /ie/. They may be puzzled to see _my_ and _by_ introduced as Tricky Words. They may even
tell you that these are not Tricky Words because ‘y’ is a spelling for /ie/. If this happens, it is a good
thing. It means these students really know the spelling code (and did not forget it over the summer).
Tell students that they are right, ‘y’ is a spelling for /ie/, and you will be reviewing this spelling a little
later. Explain that _my_ and _by_ are not tricky if you know ‘y’ is a spelling alternative for /ie/, but those
words are tricky for any student who has not yet learned that alternative. Since you cannot be sure
everybody knows it, you are going to treat these words as tricky until you teach that spelling pattern.


If you have not already done so, this unit would be the time to create two word walls. One should
be a Tricky Word Wall with yellow index cards. If you have already created a Tricky Word Wall, please
keep the words from Unit 1 on display. There will be times when you will move a word from the
Tricky Word Wall over to the Decodable Word Wall or Spelling Tree. This will happen as spellings are
reviewed. It will be interesting for students to see a word “change color” from yellow to green. There
are several ways you could make a word change color:


     - You could write the word over on a green card in front of students.


     - You could draw a green cloud circle around the Tricky Word.


     - You could create a green index card frame to put around the yellow index card.


You are encouraged to include the Tricky Words from Unit 1 in the flash card review and other quick
games you do in this unit. Students will benefit from multiple exposures to these high-frequency
words. If you do not have time to review all of the Tricky Words from Unit 1, at least include the words
that were taught at the end of Unit 1 and have therefore been rehearsed less frequently.


The second word wall you will need to create is a Decodable Word Wall. The Decodable Word Wall
should remain up for the whole year in full view of students.


Students should be encouraged to refer to the word walls throughout the day, not only at Language
Arts time.

~~**READER: BEDTIME TALES**~~


Inside the back cover of each Reader you will find the Code Load Emblem. It is pictured below. The
Code Load Emblem lets you know, at a glance, how many spellings students are expected to know
in order to read the first story and the number of spellings students need to know to read the final
story.


The Reader for this unit is _Bedtime Tales_ . In it, a father shares bedtime stories with his son and
daughter. This Reader explores two fiction genres: fables and trickster stories. Students will enjoy
reading the new tales that Dad tells Mike each night in an effort to get Mike to go to bed. Students
will most likely identify with Mike’s reluctance to go to bed on time.


This unit focuses on the following literary features: clever characters, setting, and plot, as well as
morals (fables).


~~**RE-READING**~~


In Grade 2, students continue to focus on text-dependent questions. Starting with this unit, explicit
purposeful re-reading directions are included for you to utilize with several stories from the Reader.
These lessons have been carefully crafted to focus the student on the text itself and precisely what
meanings can be derived from careful examination of said text.


The lessons in this unit gradually introduce the purposeful re-reading approach. The purposeful rereading lessons will increase in difficulty and length as the units progress.


Additionally, you will note that wherever these lessons occur, (Lessons 3, 9, and 12 of this unit)
the commitment to placing decodable text in the Reader and Activity Book does not waiver. You
will find the purposeful re-reading lessons occurring about once a week. Please note, some weeks
where writing or assessment are the focus, there may not be sufficient time available to conduct a
purposeful re-reading lesson.


Introduction
**5**


~~**GRAMMAR**~~


In this unit, the use of end punctuation and quotation marks is reviewed and practiced, as well as
capitalization of the first word of a sentence. Students who were taught using this program in Grade
1 should remember this information.


     - Throughout the unit, students may also practice decoding and spelling abbreviations for titles.


     - Tell students that using the word _mister_ or _missus_ before a person’s name is usually a way of showing
respect. Explain that when we abbreviate these words to go before a person’s name, we write it “Mr.”
and “Mrs.” Write these on the board and have students say _mister_ and _missus_ with you.


     - Explain that _Mrs._ is used before the name of a married woman, and _Ms_ . (an abbreviation for _miss_ ) is
used before the name of a girl or an unmarried woman. Tell students that _Ms._ can also be used if they
aren’t sure whether a woman is married or not.


     - Have students write the name of an adult they respect, such as a parent, teacher, or coach. Have

them write the appropriate honorific abbreviation before the person’s name. ~~**[ TEKS 2.2.B.iv; TEKS 2.2.C.iii ]**~~


~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit, writing lessons begin by having students retell a fable, “The Milk,” and write a book
report on “The Hare and the Hedgehog.” Narrative writing activities are presented in carefully
scaffolded steps. Students will review how to plan, draft, and edit, incorporating the key features of
narrative writing: character(s), setting, and plot.


Also, a friendly little fictional character named Mr. Mowse is introduced. He leaves writing samples
in the classroom from time to time to share with students. Students who used this program Grade 1
materials will be familiar with Mr. Mowse.


Students should be able to produce a plausible spelling or spelling alternative for nearly every
sound in any word they want to write. Plausible but not dictionary-correct spellings—like _hunnee_ for
_honey_ and _wate_ for _wait_ —should be given credit at this point, though they can also be corrected if
written work is being prepared for publication. Additionally, students should be held accountable for
spellings that have been taught.


During writing activities, students will have an opportunity to practice correctly spelling highfrequency words and words with sound-spellings they have learned. Refer to the scope and
sequence as needed to determine if the sound-spelling has been previously taught, and focus on
those words in their when reviewing their writing. Many writing assignments also use an editing
checklist, so students should be checking their spelling before submitting their assignment.


**TEKS 2.2.B.iv** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding compound words, contractions, and common abbreviations; **TEKS 2.2.C.iii** Demonstrate
and apply spelling knowledge by spelling compound words, contractions, and common abbreviations.


Foundational Skills 2
**6**


Students will also create a Dictation Journal that focuses on spelling words in isolation as well as in
sentences. Spelling assessments will also incorporate a phrase or sentence that students must spell
correctly.


  - For the dictation journal, you can either have students use a journal they use for other writing

activities or you may wish to create a small dictation journal for each student. Stapling five pieces of
paper together is all you will need for each journal. (1) ~~**[ TEKS 2.2.C.i; TEKS 2.2.C.iv ]**~~


**Left-Handed Cursive Writing Guidance**


Left-handed writers need to grip the writing instrument far enough back from the point to see what
is being written and not smear what has just been written. Have students grip the pencil around
1-1.5 inches from the point.


Have students tilt their paper so their arm is at a right angle to the bottom edge. This will allow the
wrist to sit at a natural arc while writing.


Have students write with their hands below the writing line and the wrist straight.


Immediately correct students who use a “hooked’ style of writing, because this may cause strain to
the wrist.


Allow your left-handed students to hold their pen or pencil with a relaxed grip, as gripping too tightly
can cause hand fatigue and strain.


Encourage your left-handed students to slant their writing to the left rather than to the right. This
will help them write more smoothly and with less smudging.


Model cursive letter formation for your left-handed students, showing them how to form each letter
from the left to the right.


Provide your left-handed students with plenty of practice time as they develop their skills.


**TEKS 2.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling one-syllable words with closed syllables; open syllables: VCe syllables: vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables, and final stable syllables; (iv) spelling multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns.


Introduction
**7**


~~**STUDENT PORTFOLIOS**~~


Writing is one of the more tangible places to help students gauge their own progress. Students
enjoy looking back at their writing from time to time throughout the year to see how much they have
grown as writers. For this reason, you should keep some type of student portfolio. In addition, this
portfolio will enable you to quickly review each student’s writing and analyze areas in need
of attention.


Here are some ideas from other teachers:


     - Allow each student to decorate a plain manila file folder. You should keep the folders in a safe spot to
keep them intact. Each time students write, file the work in their folder.


     - Create a three-ring binder for each student. This way their writing can be hole-punched and placed in
the binder.


     - Most schools have binder machines. Bind a large number of white sheets of copy paper. Bind a piece
of construction paper to the front and allow students to decorate it. All of their writing is then done in
this teacher-made booklet.


Consult with other teachers in your school or grade level team to see if there are other ideas that
might work well for your particular circumstance.


~~**UNIT 2 ASSESSMENT**~~


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


Throughout this unit, formative assessments are clearly marked for monitoring individual student
performance and progress in key skills. Quick “Checks for Understanding” to evaluate classroom
performance as a whole are also designated in various lessons.


An analysis of students’ performance on weekly spelling assessments may also be a valuable tool in
gaining insight into specific gaps in code knowledge for individual students. Use the spelling analysis
chart and directions for each assessment to summarize data about the types of errors students make.


Careful attention to this information, collected on a daily basis, will enable you to quickly determine
which students may benefit from reteaching and/or more practice in particular skills using the
Additional Support activities found at the end of each lesson.


Foundational Skills 2
**8**


**Student Performance Assessment**


In Lesson 16, you will be prompted to administer a multi-part end-of-unit assessment. During the Word
Recognition Assessment, students will be asked to look at several words on the designated activity
page and then circle the written word that matches the spoken word you say. The target words include
the vowel sound/spellings taught in this unit; distractors have been intentionally selected because
they represent frequent sound/spelling confusions. Student performance on this assessment is a
good indicator of whether students have mastered the new sound/spellings.


Students will also be asked to independently read a new story in _Bedtime Tales_ silently and then
answer written comprehension questions about the selection.


In addition, you will work individually with each student as he or she reads another short story aloud.
You will make a running record, noting any errors during the student’s oral reading, and will also time
how long it takes the student to read the story. Activity Page 16.4 provides directions for calculating
and summarizing words correct per minute for each student, so you can compare each student’s
fluency rate with national norms for other second graders. Oral discussion questions are also included
to allow you to evaluate the student’s understanding of what was read. It is strongly recommended
that you save Activity Page 16.4 for each student to compare with later measures of fluency.


~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice the Unit 2 skills can be found in the
Pausing Point section included at the end of the last lesson. Pause for 3 days to provide targeted
remediation for individual or groups of students in any areas in which they performed poorly on the
end-of-unit assessment.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the _Fluency Supplement_, is available in the program’s online materials. This
component has been designed to complement the unit. In it you will find a poem, an informational
piece titled “Did You Know?”, a Reader’s Theater, a realistic fiction selection, and a science or social
studies selection. See the Unit 1 introduction or directions in the _Fluency Supplement_ for further
guidance.


Introduction
**9**


~~**APPENDICES**~~


Unit 2 includes two appendices that provide additional information that will be useful in teaching
this unit, particularly for teachers new to the program. Appendix A, “Teacher Background
Information for Vowel Spellings and Sounds,” explains the approach used in the earlier grades to
teach letter-sound correspondences associated with vowel sounds. Appendix B, “Using Chunking to
Decode Multisyllable Words” provides an overview of how to scaffold instruction for students who
have mastered letter-sound correspondences, but struggle in decoding multisyllable words.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


In the Teacher Resources section at the end of this Teacher Guide, you will find forms and charts
that may be useful, including the following:


     - Anecdotal Reading Record—Unit 2


     - Discussion Questions Observation Record—Unit 2


     - Magic ‘e’ Template

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


If you have not already done so, beginning with this lesson you will place the
Tricky Words on a Tricky Word Wall. It will be interesting for students to see
how a word “changes color” as it becomes decodable. For example, in this
lesson, you will treat the word _street_ as a Tricky Word as students have not
yet reviewed the spelling for /ee/ as ‘ee’. However, after Lesson 3, the word
_street_ can “change color” to green as you will then have reviewed the spelling
‘ee’ for the vowel sound /ee/. Once you have reviewed the spelling, the word
_street_ can move to your Decodable Word Wall and be written on a green
index card.

**Primary Focus**
Students will distinguish between long and short vowel sounds in one-syllable
words. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.i**~~


Students will read and write one-syllable words containing /ae/ > ‘a_e’ and
/ie/ > ‘i_e’, and will change words with short-vowel sounds to words with longvowel sounds by adding the magic ‘e’ to the ends of words to form split digraphs.


~~**TEKS 2.2.A.iii; TEKS 2.2.B.i; TEKS 2.2.C.i**~~


Students will read the Tricky Words _I_, _you_, _your_, and _street_ . ~~**[TEKS 2.2.B.vii]**~~



~~**REVIEW BASIC CODE SPELLINGS (10 MIN.)**~~



~~**TEKS 2.2.C.i**~~



Code Materials




- Say the word _cap_ then the word _cape_ . Ask students: How is the vowel sound
different in these words? Explain that they will learn how to read and write
words with the long a sound in this lesson.


- Briefly review the vowel sounds from Unit 1. Using the chart you prepared in
advance, read the words aloud with students. Point out the vowel spellings in
each word.

                - Beginning on **page 1** of the **Vowel Code Flip Book** and continuing to **page 5**,
review the sounds of the vowels. Tell students these are the “short” vowel
sounds and spellings you reviewed in Unit 1. Today, they will learn new sounds
and spellings for vowels.


                 - Write the word _bake_ on the board/chart paper, and read it.


                 - Tell students the vowel sound in _bake_ is /ae/.


**TEKS 2.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (i) decoding words with short, long, or variant vowels,
trigraphs and blends; (vii) identifying and reading high-frequency words from a research-based list; **TEKS 2.2.A.iii**
Demonstrate phonological awareness by recognizing the change in spoken word when a phoneme is added, changed, or
removed; **TEKS 2.2.C.i** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by spelling one-syllable and multisyllabic words with
closed syllables; open syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables;
and final stable syllables.


Foundational Skills 2

 - Point out the spelling for the vowel sound in _bake_ is a different kind of
spelling—the two letters for the spelling are separated.


 - Explain that even though the ‘a’ and the ‘e’ in _bake_ are separated, they
work together to stand for the /ae/ sound. This kind of spelling is called a
separated digraph.


**Note:** If you prefer, you may use any of the following terms: split digraph,
separated spelling, split spelling, separated letter team, split letter team, or
magic ‘e’.


 - Circle each spelling in _bake_ as you say its sound.


with your index finger), /ae/ (simultaneously point to the letter ‘a’ with your
middle finger and the letter ‘e’ with your index finger), /k/ (point to the letter
‘k’ with your index finger).


 - Write the following ‘a_e’ words on the board/chart paper and have students
read them.





1. ate


2. late


3. made



4. safe


5. sale


6. name




- Show students the Spelling Card for /ae/ > ‘a_e’ ( _cake_ ). Have students read
the sample word. Discuss the power bar. Point out that the power bar does
not stretch all the way across the card; this means there are some other
spellings for this sound they will learn later in the year. Explain that these
spellings are shown on the Vowel Code Flip Book but will not appear in the
Readers until students have been introduced to them. Add the Spelling Card
to **page 8** of the **Vowel Code Flip Book** . Then ask students to turn to **page 8**
of their **Individual Code Charts** and outline the card in green.



Draw a horseshoe-shaped
loop around the ‘a’ and the
‘e’ to show that these two
letters work together to
stand for the /ae/ sound.


Support


To help students practice
the sound spellings ‘a_e’
and ‘i_e’, say the following
word pairs: plan—plane;
mad—made; Tim— time;
rip—ripe. Have students
repeat the words to you.
Have students hold up
the magic ‘e’ when they
say the word with the long
vowel sound.



Lesson 1 Basic code: Review /ae/ › ‘a_e’and /ie/ › ‘i_e’

Challenge


Have pairs of students
hunt for words in a
teacher-selected book for
exceptions to the ‘a_e’ and
‘i_e’ rule (have, give, fire).
Students write the found
words on slips of paper
and separate them into
two piles, separating the
‘a_e’ and ‘i_e’ words.

 - Distribute one small magic ‘e’ card to each student.


 - Write _mad_ on the board/chart paper.


 - Ask students to read the word.


 - Tell students you will add the letter ‘e’ to the word, and when you say
“Alakazam!” everyone should read the new word and hold up their magic
‘e’ cards.


 - Write the letter ‘e’ at the end of _mad_ and say “Alakazam!” All students should
respond by saying “ _made”_ and holding up their magic ‘e’ cards.


 - Write the word _rip_ on the board/chart paper. Have students read the word.


 - Tell students when you say “Alakazam!” they should hold up their magic ‘e’
cards and say the new word.


 - Add the letter ‘e’ and say, “Alakazam!” All students should hold up their cards
and read the new word, _ripe_ .


 - Proceed in this way through the list of words.

 - Collect the magic ‘e’ cards; you will use them again in the next lesson.


 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 1.1. Tell them you will play a different
version of the magic ‘e’ game. They will read each word as a group, then write
the letter ‘e’ at the end of each word. When you say “Alakazam!” students
should read the new word together aloud.


 - Finally, tell students that they will write the entire sentence that you dictate.
Students may use the back of Activity Page 1.1 or a separate sheet of paper.


 - Read the new sentence: _I will slide now._


Check for Understanding


As students read the new words on Activity Page 1.1, observe whether they are

pronouncing the word with the long vowel sound.


~~**TRICKY WORDS (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Using the Tricky Word cards you prepared in advance, tell students which
part of the word is read just as one would expect and which part is tricky.


**Tricky Word: I**

 - **Tricky:** the letter ‘I’ is pronounced /ie/, and it is always capitalized.


**Tricky Word: You**

 - **Expected:** the letter ‘y’ is pronounced /y/.


 - **Tricky:** the letters ‘ou’ are pronounced /oo/.


**Tricky Word: Your**

 - **Expected:** the letter ‘y’ is pronounced /y/.


 - **Tricky:** the letters ‘our’ are pronounced /or/.


**Tricky Word: Street**

 - **Expected:** the letters ‘str’ and the final ‘t’ are pronounced as expected.


 - **Tricky:** the letters ‘ee’ are pronounced /ee/. This may not be tricky for some
students who recall the ‘ee’ spelling from Grade 1.


**Note:** After introducing the new Tricky Words, place the word cards on the
Tricky Word Wall.

deepen understanding and gain information. ~~**TEKS 2.6.B**~~


Students will read “Mike’s Bedtime” with purpose and understanding; will practice
reading with accuracy, appropriate rate, and expression; will answer written
multiple-choice and short-answer questions about the story; and will answer
oral literal and inferential questions about the main characters, setting, and plot.


~~**TEKS 2.4; TEKS 2.8.B; TEKS 2.8.C; TEKS 2.8.D**~~


~~**INTRODUCE THE READER AND STORY (5 MIN.)**~~


  - This is the first story in the new Reader for Unit 2, _Bedtime Tales_ . Have
students take a moment to examine the cover. Explain that _tales_ is another
word for _stories_ . The focus for this unit will be on setting, characters, plot,
and a moral (when applicable). Students who have been using the program
since Kindergarten will be very familiar with these terms.


  - Open to the title page and ask students to tell you what this page of the book

is called. (If needed, remind them that this is called a title page.)


  - Ask students to turn to the table of contents and tell you what this page of

the book is called. (Again, prompt students as needed to respond that it is
the table of contents.) Ask students to identify what information is listed
in the table of contents. _(The title of each story and the page on which each_
_story begins.)_

  - Point out that the title of today’s story, “Mike’s Bedtime,” uses an apostrophe
to show possession. That is, the word _Mike’s_ shows that the bedtime that is
referred to in the story belongs to the character named Mike. (Students may
be familiar with apostrophes used to indicate contractions. They will learn
more about apostrophes used in contractions and to show possession later
in Grade 2.)

Tell students there are
three ways to pronounce
the – _ed_ ending. If the last
sound in the word is /d/
or /t/, the – _ed_ will sound
like /ed/. If the last sound
of the word is voiced (uses
noise to make the sound)
except for /d/, the – _ed_
will sound like /d/. If the
last sound in the word is
not voiced (it uses only
air to make the sound)
except for /t/, the – _ed_
will sound like /t/.


~~**ELPS 1.B; ELPS 4.A**~~


**24**




  - The words this week use the suffix – _ed_ . Explain that although you will also
show students the root word, they will only be tested on the word with the

  - _ed_ suffix added.


  - Begin by writing the root word of each spelling word. Have students read the
word after you write it on the board/chart paper. Then add the suffix – _ed_ to
the word. Ask students to read the word with the suffix added. Review briefly
that the suffix – _ed_ signals something happened in the past.

Writing


**Primary Focus:** Students will develop handwriting by accurately forming all cursive
letters using appropriate strokes when connecting letters. ~~**[ TEKS 2.2.E ]**~~


~~**CURSIVE: THE KITE STRING LETTERS: LOWERCASE ‘i’ AND ‘j’ (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Print lowercase ‘i’, ‘j’, ‘l’, ‘t’, and ‘u’ on the board. Then slowly write each letter

in cursive underneath its printed counterpart, emphasizing the first upward
motion of your hand as you write.

  - Tell students that because forming each of these letters starts with writing

an upwards line, these are called the Kite String Letters. Have a few students
draw kites attached to the upward lines of the letters.

  - Tell students that today’s lesson will focus on the lowercase letters ‘i’ and

‘j’. Model writing lowercase ‘i’ and ‘j’, one at a time, on the board or using a
projector that permits students to observe your hand movements.

    - If possible, project Digital Component 1.4 to model the cursive writing.


  - After modeling each letter, have students trace it on Activity Page 1.3. Then

have students copy the letters on the activity page.

  - Remind students that an advantage of cursive is that most letters are

connected, so the writer rarely has to lift his or her pen or pencil off the page
when writing a word.

  - Have students complete the activity page. As they work, circulate and offer

assistance as needed with forming and connecting letters.

 - Cut out several long **strips of paper** .


 - Write ‘a_e’ (as in _cake_ ) on each end of one strip, with the spellings facing
away from each other. Repeat for ‘a’ (as in _cat_ ). Make a set of spellings for
each pair of students.


Foundational Skills 2


- Have student pairs face each other, then place the strips of paper side-byside on the floor between the two with the spellings lined up at their feet.


- Explain that you will say words that have either the /ae/ or the /a/ vowel
sound. As soon as students hear the word, they should stomp the correct
spelling for the vowel sound.


- Practice with the first two words: _rat_ and _rake_ . Then, select words from the
box to read in random order.

~~**MORE HELP WITH –ED**~~


**Word Block**

  - Make one copy of the Word Block game board ( **Activity Page TR 1.1** ) for
each student pair.


  - Prepare two sets of word cards ( **Activity Page TR 1.2** ) with _–ed_ suffix words
for each student pair. If possible, print each set on a different colored paper
to differentiate between players.


  - Have students take turns drawing a card from the pile and then reading the
word on the card. When a student correctly reads a card, he or she may place
it in any square on the grid.


  - Explain that the object of the game is to try to get five cards in a straight line
(horizontally or vertically). Like in the game tic–tac–toe, students can use
their cards to block an opponent from getting five in a row, as well as to try to
get five of their own cards in a row.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


In this lesson, students will read two-syllable words. Students may recall
reading two-syllable words in Grade 1 with a dot dividing the word into
syllables. In Grade 2 that support is removed. To review reading two-syllable
words, This program begins with compound words. It is easy for students
to see the syllable division as the words easily stand alone. You may wish to
cover the second part of the word with your hand and have students read the
first word, then place your hand over the first word and have students read
the second word. (For a full explanation, please refer to Appendix B at the
end of this guide: Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words.)


**Language**

 - Write the contractions and words from the following chart on separate cards
or sentence strips to use for Review Contractions. (The chart also includes
the story where a contraction is first used so you may point it out when
reading the story.)

To help students
understand how
contractions are made,
use magnetic letters on
a magnetic whiteboard.
Demonstrate how letters
are removed from a word,
then pushed together
with the other word,
and an apostrophe is
added. Allow students to
manipulate the letters and
apostrophe to form some
contractions.

by recognizing the change in spoken word when a phoneme is added, changed, or removed.


Foundational Skills 2


- Briefly review the sound /o/ spelled ‘o’ as in hop on **Vowel Code Flip Book**
**page 5** . Remind students that in Unit 1, they reviewed all the basic code
spellings for “short” vowel sounds.


- Turn to **page 11** of the **Vowel Code Flip Book** and tell students today they
are going to learn a new sound and spelling.


- Write the word _stone_ on the board/chart paper and read it aloud.


- Tell students the vowel sound in _stone is_ /oe/.


- Point out that the spelling for the vowel sound in stone is similar to the
spelling for /ae/ and /ie/ reviewed in the last lesson—the two letters for the
spelling are separated.


- Explain that even though the ‘o’ and the ‘e’ in stone are separated,
they work together to stand for the /oe/ sound. The spelling ‘o_e’ is a
separated digraph.


- Circle each spelling in stone as you say its sound.


- Point to each spelling in stone as you say its sound: /s/ (point to the letter ‘s’
with your index finger), /t/ (point to the letter ‘t’ with your index finger), /oe/
(simultaneously point to the letter ‘o’ with your middle finger and the letter ‘e’
with your index finger), /n/ (point to the letter ‘n’ with your index finger).


- Write the following ‘o_e’ words on the board/chart paper and have students
read them:





Draw a horseshoe-shaped
loop around the ‘o’ and the
‘e’ to show that these two
letters work together to
stand for the /oe/ sound.



1. note


2. hope


3. rode



4. froze


5. broke


6. bone



Lesson 2 Basic Code: Review /oe/ › ‘o_e’and /ue/ › ‘u_e’
**35**


 - Show students the Spelling Card for /oe/ > ‘o_e’ ( _home_ ). Have students
read the sample word. Discuss the power bar. Point out that the power bar
does not stretch all the way across the card; this means there are some
other spellings for this sound they will learn later in the year. Explain that
these spellings are shown on the Vowel Code Flip Book but will not appear in
the Readers until students have been introduced to them. Add the Spelling
Card to **page 11** of the **Vowel Code Flip Book** . Then ask students to turn to
**page 8** of their **Individual Code Charts** and outline the card in green.






|Vowel Code Flip Book|Individual Code Chart|
|---|---|
|1.<br>/oe/ > ‘o_e’ (_home_) **page 11**<br>2.<br>/ue/ > ‘u_e’ (_cute_) **page 12**|1.<br>/oe/ > ‘o_e’ (_home_) **page 8**<br>2.<br>/ue/ > ‘u_e’ (_cute_) **page 8**|




- Repeat the steps for the ‘u_e’ spelling for /ue/, writing the following words on
the board/chart paper.



1. cube


2. mute


3. cute


~~**POP-OUT CHAINING (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Write _cut_ on the board/chart paper.

4. mule


5. fuse


6. fume



**36**




- Tell students you will add the letter ‘e’ to the word, and when you say
“Alakazam!” everyone should read the new word


- Write the letter ‘e’ at the end of _cut_ and say “Alakazam!” All students should
respond by saying “cute.”


- Distribute one small magic ‘e’ card to each student.


- Write the word _hop_ on the board/chart paper. Have students read the word.


- Tell students when you say “Alakazam!” they should hold up their magic ‘e’
cards and say the new word.


Foundational Skills 2


- Add the letter ‘e’ and say, “Alakazam!” All students should hold up their cards
and read the new word, _hope_ .


- Proceed in this way through the remaining words in the list.



1. cut > cute


2. hop > hope


3. cap > cape


4. not > note


5. mop > mope



6. fin > fine


7. cub > cube


8. glob > globe


9. tap > tape


10. slid > slide




  - Collect the magic ‘e’ cards; you will use them again in future lessons.


  - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 2.1. Tell them you will play a different
version of the magic ‘e’ game. They will read each word as a group, then write
the letter ‘e’ at the end of each word. When you say “Alakazam!” students
should read the new word together aloud.


  - Finally, tell students that they will write the entire sentence that you dictate.
Students may use the back of Activity Page 2.1 or a separate sheet of paper.


  - Read the new sentence: _I hope you do_ .


Check for Understanding


As students read the new words on Activity Page 2.1, observe whether they are

pronouncing the word with the long vowel sound.


~~**READ TWO-SYLLABLE WORDS (5 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.v**~~


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 2.2.


  - Tell students you are going to review how to read two-syllable words.

 - Tell students you will show them one way to help them read two-syllable

words. Cover the second part of the word with a finger and read the first part
of the word. Then cover the first part of the word with a finger and read the
second part.


 - Run a finger under the whole word and read it together aloud.


 - Remind students that even though the ‘a’ and the ‘e’ in _bake_ are separated,
they work together to stand for the /ae/ sound. Circle each spelling in _bake_
as you say its sound. Be sure to draw a horseshoe-shaped loop around the ‘a’
and the ‘e’ in bake to show that these two letters work together to stand for
the /ae/ sound.


 - Read the two-syllable words listed on Activity Page 2.2 aloud.


 - Have students “horseshoe-circle” the letters for the /oe/ and the /ue/
sounds. Briefly use any unfamiliar words in a sentence.


Activity Page 2.2: Read Two-Syllable Words


Collect Activity Page 2.2. and review it to assess each student’s ability to identify the

separated digraphs ‘o_e’ and ‘u_e’ in two-syllable words.


Foundational Skills 2


~~**TRICKY WORDS (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Refer to the Tricky Word cards you prepared in advance.


**Tricky Word: My**

  - **Expected:** the letter ‘m’ is pronounced /m/.


  - **Tricky:** the letter ‘y’ is pronounced /ie/.


**Tricky Word: By**

  - **Expected:** the letter ‘b’ is pronounced /b/.


  - **Tricky:** the letter ‘y’ is pronounced /ie/ (just as it is in my).


**Tricky Word: Have**

  - **Expected:** the letter ‘h’ is pronounced /h/ and the letter ‘v’ is
pronounced /v/.


  - **Tricky:** the letters ‘a_e’ are pronounced /a/, not /ae/.


  - Place these words on your Tricky Word Wall.


**Note:** _Have_ is a word that can be described in different ways. You may prefer
to tell students that _have_ contains /h/ spelled ‘h’, /a/ spelled ‘a’, and /v/
spelled ‘ve’. If you break up the word this way—h-a-ve—you can say that it
is not tricky at all. It is made up of spellings that students have learned. But
_have_ still should to be practiced with the other Tricky Words, because it looks
like words that have the vowel sound /ae/ spelled ‘a_e’ like _save_ and _gave_ .

                - Provide some **small tokens** as playing pieces.


                 - Students take turns drawing word cards. If a student reads the word
correctly, he or she can draw a Good to Go! card and follow the directions on
the card. If a student does not read the word correctly, he or she will draw a
card from the Oh No! pile and follow the directions on that card.


                 - The first student to make it to the moon is the winner.


**Contractions Match Maker**

                 - Use the cards you prepared for the Review Contractions lesson or copy and
cut out the Match Maker word cards ( **Activity Page TR 2.5** ).


                 - Ask students to tell you what they learned about contractions. (If needed,
remind them that a contraction is a new word made up of two words in which
some letters are replaced by an apostrophe.)


                 - Shuffle the cards and lay them facedown on the table or floor, in rows
and columns.


                 - Have students take turns flipping over two cards at a time, reading the words

**Code Knowledge**



Before today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average 501–640
of those words would be completely decodable.


After today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average 521–663 of
those words would be completely decodable.


Students have now reviewed at least one way to write 34 of the 44 sounds in English.


The spelling ‘o_e’ can be pronounced /oe/ as in _stone_, /u/ as in _above,_ or /oo/ as
in _move._


The spelling ‘u_e’ can be pronounced /ue/ as in _cube_ or /oo/ as in _tune._


_My_ is one of the 50 most common words in most samples of written English; in a typical
passage of 1,000 words, _my_ occurs 1–6 times.


_By_ is one of the 40 most common words in most samples of written English; in a typical
passage of 1,000 words, _by_ occurs 1–6 times.


_Have_ is one of the 40 most common words in most samples of written English; in a
typical passage of 1,000 words, _have_ occurs 4–7 times.

**47**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


This lesson is the first time students are introduced to a purposeful rereading lesson. You may want to tell students a little about the lesson and
how it is different from other reading lessons. You are the expert on students
in your class, so you decide how much or how little to explain. In terms
students will understand, you may say this kind of lesson focuses on only
the language used in the text. It does not ask about pictures, feelings, or
experiences students may have had outside the text. You may wish to tell
students this special kind of reading will help them read more difficult text.
To help them learn how to get the most meaning from a text, you will:


                 - ask text-dependent questions that require students to draw on evidence
from the text;


                 - identify and discuss general academic (Tier 2) vocabulary;


                 - discuss sections of the text that might pose difficulty due to complex syntax,
dense information, challenging transitions, or that require inferences; and/or


                 - engage students in a culminating writing activity that is completed
independently, if possible.


Please also note that the purposeful re-reading lessons will progress in
difficulty as students complete more of the Grade 2 material. These first
lessons are very scaffolded and rudimentary to help students gain expertise
in this type of reading.


**Language**

                 - Write the following sentences on index cards with one word or punctuation
mark on each card to use for Scrambled Sentences:


1. Can’t I sit up a bit?


2. This is a bedtime tale your gramp liked to tell me.

~~**REVIEW SPELLINGS FOR /EE/ (10 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.2.C.i**~~


  - Write the spelling ‘ee’ on the board/chart paper and ask students how they
would pronounce this spelling.


  - Once students have provided the correct sound, /ee/, ask them for the
letters used to spell the sound.


  - Remind students that when we see the letters ‘ee’, we recognize these
letters are working together as a digraph, or letter team, and we say the
sound /ee/.

 - Show students the Spelling Card for /ee/ > ‘ee’ ( _bee_ ). Have students read the
sample word. Discuss the power bar. Point out that the power bar does not
stretch all the way across the card; this means there are some other spellings
for this sound they will learn later in the year. Explain that these spellings are
shown on the Vowel Code Flip Book but will not appear in the Readers until
students have been introduced to them. Add the Spelling Card to **page 9** of

 - Write the following ‘e_e’ words on the board/chart paper and have students
read them: _Pete, eve, theme, these._


 - Show students the Spelling Card for ‘e_e’ > /ee/ ( _Pete_ ). Have students read
the sample word. Discuss the power bar. Point out that the power bar does
not stretch all the way across the card. This means there are some other
spellings for this sound students will study later in the year. Explain that
these spellings are shown on the Vowel Code Flip Book but will not appear in




- Stay on **page 9** of the **Vowel Code Flip Book** and tell students they are going
to learn another new spelling for /ee/.


- Write the word _Pete_ on the board/chart paper, and read it aloud.


- Ask students to tell you the vowel sound in _Pete_ . ( _/ee/_ )


- Point out the spelling for the vowel sound in _Pete_ is like the spelling for /oe/
and the spelling for /ue/ in the last lesson—the two letters for the spelling
are separated.


- Explain that even though the ‘e’ and the ‘e’ in _Pete_ are separated, they work
together to stand for the /ee/ sound. The spelling ‘e_e’ is a
separated digraph.


- Point to each spelling in Pete as you say its sound: /p/ (point to the letter ‘p’
with your index finger), /ee/ (simultaneously point to the first letter ‘e’ with
your middle finger and the second letter ‘e’ with your index finger), /t/ (point
to the letter ‘t’ with your index finger).

 - Write the letter ‘e’ at the end of _pet_ and say “Alakazam!” All students should
respond by saying “Pete.”


 - Point out that because this is a person’s name, the first letter ‘p’ should
be capitalized.


 - Write the word _them_ on the board/chart paper. Have students read the word.


 - Tell students when you say “Alakazam!” they should hold up their magic ‘e’
cards and say the new word.


 - Add the letter ‘e’ and say, “Alakazam!” All students should hold up their cards
and read the new word, _theme_ .


 - Proceed in this way through the remaining words in the list.


 - You should pause to point out that in some of these spellings the second ‘e’
acts as a team with the first vowel, that is, as a digraph. Only _theme_ is a split
digraph; the other spellings are side-by-side vowel teams or digraphs.



1. them > theme

As she was daydreaming and the<br>steps in her plan were becoming less and less realistic,<br>the milkmaid lost concentration on the frst step in<br>her plan and thus was not able to accomplish any of<br>the subsequent steps in her plan. Details of the text<br>include the various steps in the milkmaid’s plan for<br>spending the money she would earn from selling a<br>bucket of milk, such as buying a hen, selling the hen’s<br>eggs, buying a piglet, selling the piglet, and buying a<br>nice dress.|**Synopsis:**The story “The Milk” is a retelling of the<br>Aesop fable “The Milkmaid and the Pail.” It is the basis<br>for teaching or reviewing the fable genre. It is also the<br>basis for teaching or reviewing the moral “Take one<br>step at a time.”|

**Note to Teacher**


Today students will work in small groups for the first time in Unit 2. The
purpose of small groups is to provide time for you to work directly with a
smaller group of students so you can provide more individual attention.
Group 1 should be comprised of students needing remediation, while Group 2
should be made up of more independent learners. You will want to decide in
advance how you will divide your class. Please remember a student placed in
Group 1 one week may be in Group 2 for the next.

**Review Contractions**

  - Tape the cards or sentence strips you prepared in advance in random order
on the board/chart paper.


  - Tell students that you will review contractions again today. If necessary,
remind students that a contraction is a new word in which an apostrophe
stands for some letters that have been dropped.


  - Have students play a matching game with the words on the board/chart
paper to review contractions. Explain that a match would be the contraction
and the two words it represents. Call on individual students to make matches
on the board/chart paper.


  - Then, using their own paper, have students write to form contractions from
the following words: can not (can’t), do not (don’t), who is (who’s), we have
(we’ve). Remind students to put the apostrophe in the place where letters
have been removed.

~~**TRICKY WORDS: ALL, WHO (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Using the Tricky Word cards you prepared in advance, begin by discussing
which part of the word is read just as one would expect and which part
is tricky.


**Tricky Word: All**

  - **Expected:** the letters ‘ll’ are pronounced /l/.


**TEKS 2.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (iv) decoding compound words, contractions, and common
abbreviations; (vii) identifying and reading high-frequency words from a research-based list.



Support


To help students
understand how
contractions are made,
use magnetic letters on
a magnetic whiteboard.
Demonstrate how letters
are removed from a word,
then pushed together
with the other word,
and an apostrophe is
added. Allow students to
manipulate the letters and
apostrophe to form some
contractions.



Lesson 4 Review: Tricky Words and Quotation Marks
**67**


                      - **Tricky:** the letter ‘a’ is pronounced /aw/ (rather than /a/, as students might
expect). You may wish to mention that there are other words that follow this
pattern (e.g., ball, mall, wall). The students will learn ‘a’ as a spelling for the
/aw/ sound in a later unit.


**Tricky Word: Who**

                      - **Tricky:** The letters ‘wh’ are pronounced /h/. The letter ‘o’ is pronounced /oo/
(as in the Tricky Words do and to).


                 - Place these Tricky Words on your Tricky Word Wall.


                 - After introducing the new Tricky Words, play a Tricky Word game using the
word wall. A suggestion is to play a game called “I Spy the Word.” Give clues
for a specific word and have students guess the word.

Language


**Primary Focus:** Students will recognize that quotation marks are used for
dialogue in text, and will write quotation marks around dialogue in written

~~**REVIEW QUOTATION MARKS (20 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** In all of the sentences in this lesson, the speaker comes first, and what
is said comes at the end of the sentence. In later lessons, you will review
other ways of presenting quotation marks.

                 - Tell students there are special punctuation marks we use when writing to
show a person is speaking (in a story when people are speaking we call this
dialogue). Tell students this type of punctuation is called quotation marks.
Tell the class you will discuss how to use quotation marks today.


                 - Draw a stick figure with a speech bubble on the board/chart paper like the
one shown in the margin.


                 - Select a student and have him or her come to the front of the room where
you have written the speech bubble. Write the student’s name (for purpose
of demonstration, we will use the name _Mike_ ) above the speech bubble. Ask
Mike, “What do you like to eat?”


                 - Encourage the student, Mike, to restate the question and answer using
complete sentence (e.g., “I like to eat candy.”).


**TEKS 2.11.D.x** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including end punctuation, apostrophes in contractions, and
commas with items in a series and in dates.


Foundational Skills 2
**68**


  - Explain that speech bubbles are used to show the words a person says or
said. Write _I like to eat candy_ . in the speech bubble.


  - Explain you will now write what Mike has said as a sentence. To show exactly
what Mike has said when you write it in a sentence, explain to students that
you will use quotation marks.


  - Write _Mike said_, explaining the comma tells us to pause and the comma
comes before the quotation marks. Then write _I like to eat candy_ . Point to the
quotation marks, and explain that these show us exactly what Mike said.


  - Explain that the end punctuation is inside of the quotation marks.


  - Point out both the start of the first letter of the sentence and first word in
quotation marks is also capitalized.


  - Ask Mike to give his answer again, this time cupping both his hands around
his mouth as he speaks. Explain that cupping both your hands around your
mouth is like adding quotation marks in a written sentence. Quotation marks
show the reader exactly what a person has said during a conversation
or dialogue.


  - Repeat this procedure (calling on a new student, changing the name, asking
a question, writing the answer in the speech bubble, and then writing the
answer in a sentence). Point out once again the comma before the first
quotation mark, capital letter at the beginning of the sentence, and end
punctuation inside the last quotation mark.


  - Refer to the sentences you prepared in advance and model writing in the
quotation marks.


    - Jane said, “I can run.”


    - Frank said, “We like cake.”


    - James said, “Let’s go skating.”


    - Pete said, “Do you like frogs?”


Check for Understanding


After adding the quotation marks and commas to the four sentences on the board/

chart paper, have students read them aloud one sentence at a time. Tell students to

cup their hands around their mouths when they read the words inside the quotation

marks. They should leave their hands down when they are reading words outside of

the quotation marks.

                        - Pick a card from the pile and ask the first person on the team to read it. If
the word is read correctly, draw a line or move the token from home plate
to first base, signifying a “hit.” This player should go to the back of his or
her team’s line, while the next player comes forward to read the next card.
If he or she reads the word correctly, draw a line or move the token from

first to second base. Play continues in this way, so that each time a player
reads a word correctly a line is drawn or the token is moved to the next
base. If the fourth player reads the word correctly, draw a line or move the
token from third base to home plate and mark “1 run” for this team. Play
continues by the members of this team so long as no words are misread.
When a word is misread, the next team takes its turn at bat.


 - Just as in the actual game of baseball, any players “left on base” when a word
is misread do not count or add to the score.

  - Create a set of word cards for each player **(Activity Page TR 5.1)** . Assign
each word a point value based on the difficulty of the word; you may want to
assign one point for one-syllable words, two points for two-syllable words,
three points for three-syllable words, and so on.


  - Each player gets a preset time limit to attempt to read as many words
as possible within the time. Students get points for the words they read
correctly and get no points for words they misread or skip.


**Crazy Eights**

  - Create a deck of word cards by making a copy of **Activity Pages TR 2.8,**
**TR 3.1, TR 4.1, and TR 5.1,** using a different color for each sheet. Copy on
card stock to allow for reuse.

                 - Each word should be one of four colors (suits), and there should be an equal
number of each color.


                  - Give each player five cards to start. Put the rest of the deck in the middle,
and flip the top card over next to the deck. This face up card becomes the
discard pile.


                  - Taking turns, each student can either play a card that is the same color or that
starts with the same letter as the card at the top of the discard pile. To be able
to play a card, a student must correctly read the card or lose his or her turn.


                  - If a student does not have a card that is either the same color or that starts
with the same letter as the top card of the discard pile, then he or she can
draw from the deck. If there are no more cards left in the deck, shuffle the
discard pile, which becomes the new deck.


~~**PROGRESS MONITORING (OPTIONAL)**~~


                 - Make a copy of the Word Cards for Progress Monitoring 1 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 5.2** ). Cut apart the word cards.


                 - Make one copy of the Record Sheet for Progress Monitoring 1 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 5.3** ) for each student you are assessing.


                 - Model with the sample item.


                 - Show the cards to the student one at a time. Use the record sheet to record
each word as the student reads.


                 - Place a check next to each word read correctly.


                 - For misread words, write exactly what students say as the word is sounded
out. If students misread a word, prompt them to try to read the word again,
letting them know their first attempt was incorrect.


**Scoring:** Scoring is based on one point assigned for every sound-spelling in
a word which is read correctly. Interpret scores as follows:


                        - 11 or 12 points—excellent


                        - 8–10 points—good


                        - Less than 8 points—poor


**Goal:** Achieve scores of good or excellent (8 points or more).

required. Further analyze student errors to determine whether there are one
or more particularly problematic sound/spellings. The subtotals for targeted
sound/spellings at the bottom of the record sheet facilitate the identification
of specific problem areas.


Also examine whether there are mispronunciations occurring more
frequently in a given position in words. For example, does the student read
the initial sound correctly, but misread the medial and/or final sound?


Finally, examine whether the student succeeded in reading words correctly
on the second attempt. If so, the student may be rushing and may benefit
from explicit instruction to slow down and look at each letter in a word
sequentially, left to right.


**Code Knowledge**


Before today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average 550–697
of those words would be completely decodable.


After today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average 558–727 of
those words would be completely decodable.


The spelling ‘oo’ can be pronounced /oo/ as in _soon_ or /oo/ as in _took_ .


_No_ is one of the 60 most common words in most samples of written English; in a typical
passage of 1,000 words, _no_ occurs 2–3 times.


_So_ is one of the 50 most common words in most samples of written English; in a typical
passage of 1,000 words, _so_ occurs 1–5 times.

  - Display the writing process graphic you prepared in advance (Digital
Component 6.1). Keep this graphic on display in the classroom for student
reference anytime they are writing.


  - Tell students this graphic shows the three steps good writers use when they
write. Even authors of their favorite books use steps like these when
they write.


  - Tell students they will refer to this graphic whenever they have
writing lessons.


  - Point to the first step on the graphic: plan. Ask students what the person in
the picture is doing. _(He is thinking, or planning.)_


  - Explain that before you begin writing, you have to think about the topic and
brainstorm ideas. This is called planning, or making a plan.


  - Point to the second step on the graphic: draft. Ask students to identify this
picture. _(pencil and paper)_


  - Explain the next part of the process is to start writing ideas on paper. This is
called drafting, or making a draft.


  - Point to the last step on the graphic: edit. Ask students to identify this
picture. _(paper and eraser)_


  - Tell students the last part of the writing process is to re-read the draft and fix
any mistakes. This is called editing.


  - Review the three steps of the writing process one more time by pointing to
each icon and asking students to name the step.


**Review Story Elements**

  - Remind students that this unit’s Reader, _Bedtime Tales_, includes

**Analysis of Elements of a Fictional Story**

  - Explain that you will re-read “The Milk” aloud, and you want students to pay
special attention to the title, characters, and setting, and to the beginning,
middle, and end of the plot.


  - Re-read “The Milk” aloud.


  - While reading the story, draw attention to the difference between narrative
text and dialogue. Remind students that dialogue is the part of a story where
the characters speak. Remind students that dialogue has quotation marks to
set off the exact words a person is saying.


  - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 6.1.


  - Explain that this activity page is the same as the planning template displayed.

Tell students you will fill in the planning template together as a class.


  - Complete the planning template as a class, identifying the title, characters,
setting, and plot of “The Milk.”


  - While discussing Jane as a character, point out and list some character traits
she exhibits (dreamer, planner, farmer, perhaps clumsy).


  - As you fill out the setting, have students provide some details about the
setting. They will need this information when they rewrite the story in the
next lesson.


  - Remind students that the plot can be divided into the beginning, middle,
and end. Explain that an author makes decisions about which details to give
at the beginning of the story, which events to develop across the middle of
the story, and which events to resolve at the end. These decisions create the
structure of the story.


  - Tell students they will use this planning template to rewrite the story in the
next lesson.

Lesson 7 Writing: Draft a Fictional Narrative
**103**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today you will review the ‘ou’ sound spelling for /ou/ learned in Grade 1.
You will also introduce a spelling alternative for the /ou/ sound: ‘ow’ as in
_now_ . The chart shows you which of these spellings is most common for this
sound.


Students should already know the basic code spelling ‘ou’ as in _shout_ .
They should also have learned to read two Tricky Words containing
/ou/ > ‘ow’, _down_ and _how_ . Students learned to recognize these as Tricky
Words. Some students may also have learned to read other ‘ow’ words by
analogy. However, we have not assumed they would be able to do so. At this
point, they can be shown that _down_ and _how_ are part of a larger family of
/ou/ > ‘ow’ words, so you can change these words on your word wall from
tricky (yellow) to decodable (green).


Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


                     - ‘ **ow** ’ is common at the end of words and syllables ( _how, now_ ); ‘ **ou** ’ is not


                     - ‘ **ow** ’ is widely used before other vowel spellings ( _shower_, _flower_, _plowing_ );
‘ **ou** ’ is not


                     - ‘ **ow** ’ appears in front of only a handful of consonant spellings, including
‘l’ ( _growl_, _owl_ ), ‘n’ ( _town_, _frown_ ), and ‘d’ ( _crowd_ )


                     - ‘ **ou** ’ represents the /ou/ sound in most other situations (other than those
mentioned above)


                     - ‘ **ou** ’ appears in front of a wide range of consonant spellings ( _out_, _our_, _hound_,
_bounce_, _couch_ )


                     - ‘ **ou** ’ is widely used at the beginning of words ( _outside_, _ounce_ ); ‘ **ow** ’ is not ( _owl_ )

~~**REVIEW /OU/ › ‘OU’ AND ‘OW’ (25 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students the sound they will learn is /ou/.


  - Have students say the sound /ou/.


  - Ask students to think of words containing the /ou/ sound. As students offer
words, write the words on the board/chart paper, sorting the words into
columns according to the spelling used for /ou/ and underlining the letters
that stand for the /ou/ sound in each word.


  - For example, if a student says “cow,” list the word under the heading ‘ow’ and
underline the ‘ow’. If a student says “mouth,” list the word under the heading
‘ou’ and underline the ‘ou’. If a student says “powerhouse,” list the word twice,
once under the heading ‘ow’, with the ‘ow’ underlined, and once under the
heading ‘ou’, with the ‘ou’ underlined.

|‘ou’|‘ow’|
|---|---|
|mouth <br>house <br>powerhouse|power<br>powerhouse|



  - Remind students that in Grade 1 they learned one spelling for this sound, ‘ou’.


  - Use the Vowel Code Flip Book to review the ‘ou’ spelling. Point out the power
bar for the ‘ou’ spelling and explain that there are other spellings for /ou/.


  - Students will probably come up with examples of both the ‘ou’ and ‘ow’
spelling patterns listed above, but if the spelling ‘ow’ does not end up on the
chart spontaneously, introduce it. You can do this by writing a familiar Tricky
Word like _down_ or _how_ on the board/chart paper, asking students to read the
word, and then asking them which letters stand for the /ou/ sound in
each word.

- To provide additional practice, write the following words on the board/chart
paper one at a time.



1. downtown


2. showers

 - Show students the Spelling Card for /ou/ > ‘ow’ ( _now_ ). Have students read
the example word. Discuss the power bar. Add the Spelling Card to the **Vowel**
**Code Flip Book** on **page 15** . Ask students to outline the card on **page 9** of
the **Individual Code Chart.**



Challenge


Ask students to generate
three more words with the
/ou/ sound in the word.

  - Point out the words _frowning_ and _downtown._ Explain that students can read
these words using syllable division patterns.


  - Point to the first word, _frowning._ Say, “In this word, I see two vowel sounds
(/ow/ and /i/) on each side of a consonant (‘n’). Even though ‘w’ is a
consonant, it is working with ‘o’ to make the vowel sound /ou/, so I’m going
to treat it like part of the vowel.”


  - Underline the vowels.


  - Say, “When only one consonant comes between two vowels, I divide after the
first vowel. This is a vowel-consonant-vowel pattern.”


  - Draw a vertical line between _frow_ and _ning._


  - Next, point to the word _downtown._ Say, “In this word, I see two vowel sounds
(/ow/ and /ow/) on each side of two consonants (‘nt’). Again, even though
‘w’ by itself is a consonant, in this case it’s working with ‘o’ to make the vowel
sound /ow/, so I’m going to treat it as part of the vowel.”


  - Underline the vowels.


  - Say, “When two consonants come between two vowels, I divide between the
consonants. This is a vowel-consonant-consonant-vowel pattern. This word is
also a compound word, or a word that is formed from two other words: _down_ and
_town._ We usually divide compound words into syllables between the words.”


  - Draw a vertical line between _down_ and _town._

  - If you have not already done so, return completed Activity Page 6.1
to students.


  - Pointing to the writing process graphic displayed in the classroom (Digital
Component 6.1), remind students that planning is the first step in the
writing process.


  - Display the planning template you completed in the previous lesson, or use
the digital version (Digital Component 7.1).


  - Remind students that during the last lesson they worked together to retell
the story “The Milk.” They used this planning template to write down
their ideas. The information in the planning template is the plan they will use
to begin drafting their stories.


**Draft**

  - Tell students now that the story has been planned, the next step is to write a
draft of it. They will do this as a class—you will scribe the story as students
dictate sentences to you.


**TEKS 2.11.B.i** Develop drafts into a focused piece of writing by organizing with structure; **TEKS 2.12.A** Compose literary texts,
including personal narratives and poetry.



Foundational Skills 2

- Explain that you will write the draft in paragraph format on the
board/chart paper.


- Write the title of the class story at the top of the board/chart paper and

remind students the title is the first thing they need to write down in a draft.


- Tell students the starting sentence of the story should introduce the characters
and the setting, specifying where and when it takes place. You may wish to
encourage students to use the classic opening phrase: _Once upon a time. . ._


- Have students consult the notes on the planning template to come up with a
good starting sentence for the story. Talk about several possible sentences
orally before selecting one to write. Encourage students to think about
the overall structure of the story and what kind of sentence would best
introduce it.


- Write the sentence on the board/chart paper. Model how to indent by placing
your pointer (index) finger down and beginning to write the first sentence
of the paragraph after your pointer finger. Point out that the sentence starts
with a capital letter and ends with a punctuation mark.


- Work with students to first write the beginning, then the middle, and finally
the end of the story, asking students to help you transform the notes on the
planning template into complete sentences. Be sure to use temporal words
to structure the sequence of events ( _first_, _next_, _then_, _last_, etc.).


- Assist students in formulating sentences that convey dialogue (e.g.,
Jane said, “Who will buy my milk?”) and point out the appropriate use of
punctuation, especially noting the quotation marks.


- As you transcribe the oral sentences, continue to model and emphasize written
sentences beginning with a capital letter and ending with a punctuation mark.


- You are encouraged to keep the story short and focused, but try to write
more than one paragraph. Explain that when writers write more than a few
sentences, they divide their writing into sections called paragraphs. Explain
that each paragraph is indented. Model how to indent the first line by placing
your pointer (index) finger down and beginning to write the first sentence of
the paragraph after your pointer finger. Model this in the draft.


- Tell students the ending sentence of the story should wrap up the story
and let the reader know the story is finished. This is a good place to remind
students this particular story is a fable. A good way to end this retelling of the
story is to include a moral: “Take one step at a time.”


- Write the ending sentence on the board/chart paper. You may also wish to
add _The End_ at the end of the paragraph. However be sure to point out that
_The End_ should not replace the actual ending sentence.

**Code Knowledge**


Before today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average
568–740 of those words would be completely decodable.


After today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average
577–756 of those words would be completely decodable.


Students have now reviewed at least one way to write 40 of the 44 sounds
in English.


The spelling ‘ow’ can be pronounced /oe/ as in _snow_ or /ou/ as in _now_ .


The spelling ‘ou’ is usually pronounced /ou/ as in _out_ ; however, it can also be

professional writers do not write perfect stories on the first try. They edit and
rework their writing to make it better.

this is not the draft you worked on as a class but rather one that appeared
like magic overnight in the classroom.

 - Show students the image of Mr. Mowse you prepared in advance. Encourage
students to read Mr. Mowse’s name. Ask students if they know how to write
_mouse_ . Explain that both ‘ou’ and ‘ow’ can be used to spell /ou/. Mr. Mowse
apparently spells his name with an ‘ow’. The draft is from Mr. Mowse. Mr.
Mowse likes to “listen in” to class writing lessons and try to write the same
things the students are learning to write. But Mr. Mowse is very shy. He waits
until everyone goes home to leave what he has written for students to find
the next day. Mr. Mowse likes to write, but he needs some help with editing.
Mr. Mowse will appear from time to time in other lessons.

) **Digital Component 8.3**


 - Point and read the display copy of the editing checklist (Digital
Component 8.3). Discuss the Tricky Words: _questions_, _title_, _character_,
_middle_, _final_ .


 - Explain that this is an editing checklist that has some questions addressed to
the author. The questions are suggestions the author might want to consider
to make his or her writing better.


 - Read the first question of the checklist.


 - Ask the class if the draft has a title. If so, make a check mark next to the
question on your editing checklist.


 - Complete the remaining questions and discuss whether the item can be
checked off; if not, talk about whether improvements could be made.


**Note:** Students will learn more about pronoun cases in Lesson 13.



Foundational Skills 2
**118**


  - Model making any changes to the draft that the class agrees would be
changes for the better. For example, you can ask students if there are places
where details could be added, describing the look, sound, feel, or smell of
characters, places, or things in the story. If students need prompting, call
their attention to one sentence at a time, reading the sentence aloud; ask
them to improve the sentence by adding one specific sense-based detail.


  - Use the following editing conventions when correcting the draft. Explicitly call
students’ attention to these conventions, explaining this is how professional
writers edit their work. Explain they will use these same corrections when
they edit their own work:


    - Cross out punctuation mistakes and write the correct punctuation mark
above the incorrect one.

    - Cross out capitalization mistakes and write the correct uppercase or
lowercase letter above the incorrect one.

    - Write a caret (^) where a word or punctuation mark needs to be inserted.
Write the word or punctuation mark above the caret.

    - Correct spelling mistakes if students notice or question them. You should
accept phonemically plausible spellings for spellings students have not
yet learned.


  - You can also ask students if they have any other suggestions to improve the
author’s writing. Explain that they should make suggestions by asking
a question.


  - Model this by using a phrase, such as: “I was wondering if we might make
the writing even better if we . . . ?” Using this phrase, or similar phrasing, will
make it clear to students that they are making suggestions for consideration
rather than mandatory changes.


Check for Understanding


As changes are suggested, have students use **Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down** to indicate

whether they agree that the revision makes the writing better. Make agreed-upon

changes on the classroom draft. (Two or three suggestions are sufficient at this stage.)

**Copy the Draft**

  - When you have finished editing the draft, explain that authors often want to
share their writing with other people.


  - Ask students, “Do you think it would be easy or difficult for someone other
than the author to read this draft? Why?”


  - Explain that to share the edited draft, it will have to be copied onto a clean
piece of paper or entered into a digital version using a computer or tablet or
other word processing device incorporating all of the changes made on the
draft. Let the class know the next step would be to recopy or electronically
enter new text for the story.


  - Summarize by saying students have now completed the three steps in the
writing process. They planned their story on a planning activity page by
specifying the title, characters, setting, and plot. They drafted their story
by writing the information from the plan onto paper and writing complete
sentences in a paragraph format. Finally, they edited and improved a draft by
using an editing checklist and making changes to a draft.


  - Tell students that they will learn how to write a book report later in this unit.


Activity Page 8.1: Editing Checklist


Pay attention to students’ ability to use an editing checklist to edit and improve a

draft, and to make changes to a draft.


**CURSIVE: THE KITE STRING LETTERS:**

~~**TEKS 2.2.E**~~


  - Tell students that today they will learn to write a new set of Kite String
Letters: Lowercase ‘p’ and ‘r’.


  - Explain that, like the other Kite String Letters, ‘p’ and ‘r’ also start with a line
from the bottom like the string of a kite.


  - Print a lowercase ‘p’ and ‘r’ on the board. Then slowly write each letter in
cursive underneath its printed counterpart, emphasizing the first upward
motion of your hand as you write.


    - If possible, project Digital Component 8.4 to model the cursive writing.

~~**MORE HELP PLANNING, DRAFTING, AND EDITING**~~


                 - Provide support for students who need additional time to complete their draft
retelling of “The Milk” from Lesson 7. (If needed, work individually with students
to complete the planning template and to develop their notes into a draft.)


                 - Work individually with students to complete the editing checklist ( **Activity**
**Page TR 8.4** ) or **Activity Page 8.1** from today’s lesson and edit their drafts.


                 - As time permits, support students in using **word processing software** to
create a final draft, or write their final copy on a separate **piece of paper** .


~~**PROGRESS MONITORING (OPTIONAL)**~~


                 - Make a copy of the Word Cards for Progress Monitoring 2 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 8.5** ). Cut apart the word cards.


                - Make one copy of the Record Sheet for Progress Monitoring 2 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 8.6** ) for each student you are assessing.


                 - Model with the sample item.


                 - Show the cards to the student one at a time. Use the Record Sheet to record
each word as the student reads.


                 - Place a check next to each word read correctly.


                 - For misread words, write exactly what students say as the word is sounded
out. If students misread a word, prompt them to try to read the word again,
letting them know their first attempt was incorrect.


**Scoring:** Scoring is based on one point assigned for every sound/spelling in
a word which is read correctly. Interpret scores as follows:


                        - 12 or 13 points—excellent

                        - 10 or 11 points—good

                        - 8–10 points—good

                        - Less than 8 points—poor


**Goal:** Achieve scores of good or excellent (8 points or more).


Foundational Skills 2
**122**


Scores of 7 or less indicate additional reteaching and reinforcement is
required. Further analyze student errors to determine whether there are one
or more particularly problematic sound/spellings. The subtotals for targeted
sound/spellings at the bottom of the record sheet facilitate the identification
of specific problem areas.


Also examine whether there are mispronunciations occurring more
frequently in a given position in words. For example, does the student read
the initial sound correctly, but misread the medial and/or final sound?


Finally, examine whether the student succeeded in reading words correctly
on the second attempt. If so, the student may be rushing and may benefit
from explicit instruction to slow down and look at each letter in a word
sequentially, left to right.


~~**SENTENCES AND PHRASES**~~


 - Have students read the following sentences and phrases aloud for additional
reading practice.



1. Get a kick out of it.


2. Things got out of hand.


3. His plan was foiled.


4. Join the club.



5. She has a point.


6. spoiled milk


7. Enjoy the meal.


8. Toys are fun.

Challenge


Ask students to write an
original sentence using
quotation marks, and
share it with the class on
the board/chart paper.



**Primary Focus:** Students will orally review the difference between dialogue and
narration, and will use quotation marks to designate dialogue in written text.

~~**TEKS 2.11.D.x**~~


~~**WARM-UP (10 MIN.)**~~


**Review Quotation Marks**

  - Remind students that they have been working with a new type of punctuation
in Unit 2 called quotation marks.


  - Review that quotation marks are used to show exactly what a person
has said. In the stories in Bedtime Tales, the characters often have a
conversation, that is they talk to one another. This is called dialogue. When
there is a dialogue between characters in a story, quotation marks are used
to show what each character has said.


  - Remind students that when practicing dialogue orally, we cup both hands
around our mouth to represent where quotation marks would go in a
sentence. To demonstrate, say, “James said,” then cup both hands around
your mouth and say, “Let’s eat lunch,” then put your hands down. Tell
students the quotation marks would go around _Let’s eat lunch_ .


  - Ask students to listen to the sentence you will say to hear where the
quotation marks should go. Say: “Jorge said, ‘I like to sing.’” Have students
repeat the sentence and cup both hands around their mouths to show where
the quotation marks should go.


  - Repeat this activity with the sentence: _Raj said, “The beach was so hot.”_


  - After orally reviewing quotation marks, tell students they will now practice
marking written dialogue with quotation marks.


~~**PRACTICE QUOTATION MARKS (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Draw a stick figure and speech bubble on the board/chart paper.


  - Use the same procedure as Lesson 4 to review quotation marks (call on a
student, write his or her name on the board/chart paper, ask him or her a
question, write his or her answer in the speech bubble, and then rewrite
his or her answer in a sentence). This time, however, what the student says
should come at the beginning of the sentence.


  - For example, you may write a sentence such as: _“I like to play ball_, _” said Juan._


**TEKS 2.11.D.x** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including end punctuation, apostrophes in contractions, and
commas with items in a series and in dates.



Foundational Skills 2
**128**


 - Circle the quotation marks, the comma, and the end punctuation; then
underline the dialogue.


 - Pause to point out the comma before the last set of quotation marks. Explain
that when dialogue comes at the beginning of a sentence, it should end with
a comma followed by the end quotation marks.


 - Repeat this process with one more student (call on a student, write his or her
name on the board/chart paper, ask him or her a question, write the answer
in the speech bubble, and then write the answer in a sentence).


 - Pause to ask students if you should write a comma or a period at the end of
the dialogue. (If necessary, prompt them with a reminder that the dialogue is
at the beginning of the sentence so you will use a comma at the end followed
by the last set of quotation marks.)


 - Write another sentence on the board/chart paper, such as _”I like to play_
_baseball football and video games” said Mari._


 - First, have students use what they have learned about commas and
quotation marks to properly punctuate the quote.


 - Then, explain that when there are several items listed in a sentence, they
should use commas to separate the series of items.


 - Ask students to name the items in the series. _(baseball, football, video games)_


 - Add commas so that the final sentence reads _”I like to play baseball, football,_
_and video games,” said Mari._


 - After you finish, circle the quotation marks, the end punctuation, and the
comma; then underline the dialogue to help students see the pattern.


 - Complete Activity Page 9.1 as a class. Have students read each speech
bubble and write the dialogue as a complete sentence.


 - Remind students that even though there is a period in the statement in the
speech bubble, when they write it as dialogue at the beginning of a sentence,
they must change that period to a comma.


 - Allow students to complete the back of the activity page independently or
with a partner, and encourage students to use the Individual Code Chart to
help them with spellings.


 - Review the activity page as a class. Tell students to check carefully to see if
they included end punctuation in the appropriate place.

  - Ask students if they know what a hedgehog and a hare are. If students are
not familiar with the terms, explain that hedgehogs are small animal with
spines (or spikes) all over their bodies. Hedgehogs have short legs and will
roll into a tight ball if they feel they are in danger. Hares are like rabbits.
However, they are bigger, and they are very fast. Hares are also known as
jackrabbits.


  - Tell students “The Hare and the Hedgehog” is a trickster tale. Remind
students in a trickster tale, one character is usually clever and tricks

determine if students are properly pronouncing and using the words.


~~**REVIEW /ER/**~~ ~~>~~ ~~**‘ER’ (15 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii**~~


 - Write the spelling ‘er’.


 - Explain that the letter ‘r’ is a spelling for consonant sound /r/, but the sound

/r/ can mingle with certain vowel sounds to create unique vowel sounds
like /er/. We know /er/ is a vowel sound because adding it to a word adds a
syllable: _steep_   - _steeper_ .


 - Turn to **Vowel Code Flip Book page 19** and put the Spelling Card on the

appropriate space. Discuss the power bar.


 - Distribute the blue markers. Students have not used the color blue this year.

Explain that /er/ is an r-controlled vowel sound, and they will use blue to
mark r-controlled vowels on the Individual Code Chart.


 - Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart page 10** . Guide students in

outlining the appropriate card on the chart.

**CURSIVE: THE KITE STRING LETTERS:**
~~**LOWERCASE ‘s’ AND ‘w’ (10 MIN.)**~~


~~**TEKS 2.2.E**~~


  - Tell students that today they will learn to write a new set of Kite String
Letters: lowercase ‘s’ and ‘w’.


  - Explain that, like the other Kite String Letters, ‘s’ and ‘w’ also start with a line
from the bottom like the string of a kite.


  - Print a lowercase ‘s’ and ‘w’ on the board. Then slowly write each letter in

cursive underneath its printed counterpart, emphasizing the first upward
motion of your hand as you write.


    - If possible, project Digital Component 8.4 to model the cursive writing.


  - If time permits, have a few students come to the board to draw kites

attached to the upward lines of the letters.


  - Stand facing away from the class and model writing each letter in the air.

                   - Point to the first word, _camel._ Say, “In this word, I see two vowels on each side
of a consonant.”


                 - Underline the vowels.


                - Say, “When only one consonant comes between two vowels, I divide after
the first vowel. This is a vowel-consonant-vowel pattern.”

**Code Knowledge**


Before today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average 580–759
of those words would be completely decodable.


After today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average 612–782 of
those words would be completely decodable.


Students have now reviewed at least one way to write 41 of the 44 sounds in English.


The spelling ‘er’ is fairly regular in its pronunciation; however, it can also be pronounced
/e/ + /r/ as in very and /ee/ + /r/ as in _Erie_ .


_They_ is one of the 30 most common words in most samples of written English; in a
typical passage of 1,000 words, _they_ occurs 3–8 times.


_Their_ is one of the 200 most common words in most samples of written English; in a
typical passage of 1,000 words, _their_ occurs 1–3 times.

  - Begin by reviewing the spelling ‘er’ from Lesson 10. Remind students the
spelling ‘er’ makes a unique vowel sound. Write the words _faster_, _nerve_, and
_her_ on the board/chart paper. Have students read the words aloud as a class,
paying close attention to the /er/ vowel sound.


  - Write ‘or’ on the board/chart paper and explain that by itself, the letter ‘r’ is
a spelling for the consonant sound /r/, but the sound /r/ can mingle with
certain vowel sounds to create unique vowel sounds like /or/.


  - Turn to **Vowel Code Flip Book page 20** and put the Spelling Card on the
appropriate space. Discuss the power bar. Point out the power bar is large
but does not stretch all the way across the card; this means there are some
other spellings for this sound students will study later in the year.


  - Distribute the blue markers.

marks. _(Quotation marks show the reader exactly what a person has said_
_during a conversation or dialogue.)_


  - Tell students today they will again work with sentences that include dialogue
and they will need to add quotation marks. However, tell students they will
also need to pay attention to other punctuation that may be needed, as
well as capital letters. Write the sentence _I would like to take a nap said Ann._
on the board/chart paper. Have a student come to the board/chart paper
and place both sets of quotation marks and a comma before the last set of
quotation marks.


  - Review with students that sentences begin with a capital letter. Write an
exclamation point and a question mark on the board/chart paper, and have
students explain when we use these types of ending punctuation.


  - Have students open their Activity Books to Activity Page 11.2. Explain that

~~**INTRODUCE SPELLING WORDS (10 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iv; TEKS 2.2.C.iii**~~


 - Tell students the spelling words this week are contractions. Remind students
when something contracts, it gets smaller. Similarly, we can contract (make
smaller) two words by combining them together and leaving out a letter.



1. it is = it’s


2. that is = that’s


3. she is = she’s


4. is not = isn’t


5. are not = aren’t



6. was not = wasn’t

Ask students to write the
two words which make
up each contraction on
an index card. Have them
circle the letters that will
be removed to make the
contraction. Then, write
the contracted form of the
word on the reverse side.
Have students take cards
home for practice with a
family member.




  - Begin by writing the first two words on the board/chart paper, _it is_ . Tell
students that to combine these two words into a contraction, _it is_ becomes
_it’s_ . The apostrophe replaces the letter ‘i’ in the word _is_ .


  - Tell students _it’s_ can also stand for the words _it has_ . In this case the
apostrophe replaces the letters ‘h’ and ‘a’ in _has_ . They will need to look at
the meaning of the sentences around the word to decide which set of words
make up the contraction.


  - Write _that is_ on the board/chart paper, and show students how these two
words combine to create the contraction _that’s_ . The apostrophe replaces the
letter ‘i’ in the word _is_ .

make up the contraction.


 - Write _she is_ on the board/chart paper. Based on the last two words, ask
students to predict what the contraction for _she is_ will be. _(she’s)_


 - Tell students _she’s_ can also stand for the words _she has_ . In this case the
apostrophe replaces the letters ‘ha’ in _has_ . They will need to look at the
meaning of the sentences around the word to decide which set of words
make up the contraction.


 - Continue through the rest of the words in this fashion: show students how to
form contractions for _is not_ and _are not_, pointing out the apostrophe replaces
the letter ‘o’ in _not_, and have them predict the contraction of _was not_ . Show
students how to form contractions for _I will_ and _you will_, pointing out that the
apostrophe replaces the letters ‘w’ and ‘i’ in _will_, and have them predict the
contraction of _she will_ .


 - Discuss the Tricky Word _their_, pointing out what is tricky and what is
expected about the word.


~~**REVIEW ACTIVITY PAGES (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain that students will take home Activity Page 11.5 to read and discuss
“How the Hedgehog Tricked the Hare” with a family member. After reading
the story, they should write the story’s title, characters, setting, and plot on
Activity Page 11.6.

out. If students misread a word, prompt them to try to read the word again,
letting them know their first attempt was incorrect.


**Scoring:** Scoring is based on one point assigned for every sound/spelling in
a word which is read correctly. Interpret scores as follows:


                        - 14 or 15 points—excellent


                        - 11–13 points—good


                        - 8–10 points—fair


                        - Less than 8 points—poor


**Goal:** Achieve scores of good or excellent (11 points or more).


Scores of 10 or less indicate additional reteaching and reinforcement is required.
Further analyze student errors to determine whether there are one or more
particularly problematic sound/spellings. The subtotals for targeted sound/
spellings at the bottom of the record sheet facilitate the identification of
specific problem areas.


Foundational Skills 2
**166**


Also examine whether there are mispronunciations occurring more
frequently in a given position in words. For example, does the student read
the initial sound correctly, but misread the medial and/or final sound?


Finally, examine whether the student succeeded in reading words correctly
on the second attempt. If so, the student may be rushing and may benefit
from explicit instruction to slow down and look at each letter in a word
sequentially, left to right.


~~**SENTENCES AND PHRASES**~~


 - Use the following list of sentences and phrases to extend your lessons,
as needed.



1. It will cost you an arm and a leg.


2. A tree falls in the forest.


3. a rock and a hard place

Writing


**Primary Focus:** Students will use a planning template to write a draft of a book
report about “The Hare and the Hedgehog,” specifying the title, characters, setting,
and plot of the story. ~~**TEKS 2.11.B.i; TEKS 2.12.B**~~


~~**DRAFT A NARRATIVE BOOK REPORT (40 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.11.B.i**~~


**Review the Plan**

  - Remind students they have been writing narratives in Unit 2. Today they

will begin writing a specific type of narrative called a book report. Their
book report will be on “The Hare and the Hedgehog” (including “How the
Hedgehog Tricked the Hare”).


  - Explain that a book report is not just a narrative that retells the story. For a

book report, students should share their opinion and/or their impressions, or
thoughts, about the story. For example, they may write about what they liked,
what they disliked, and/or connections they made (to their own lives, other
stories, etc.).


  - Have students take out Activity Page 11.6 that they completed as homework.

Remind students the first step in writing is to plan. They planned for their
book report by writing notes about the characters, setting, and plot of the
story “The Hare and the Hedgehog” on Activity Page 11.6.


) **Digital Component 12.1**


  - Review the activity page as a class. Record responses on the board/
chart paper so it is visible for all students to see (in case anyone left their
activity page at home), or use the digital version (Digital Component 12.1).


**Write a Draft**

  - Remind students of the three steps in the writing process—plan, draft, and
edit. Tell students because they have already planned, today they will take
the next step in the writing process and write a draft.


  - Tell students they will draft their book report in paragraph structure.


  - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 12.1.


**TEKS 2.11.B.i** Develop drafts into a focused piece of writing by organizing with structure; **TEKS 2.12.B** Compose
informational texts, including procedural texts and reports.



Foundational Skills 2
**172**


 - Tell students the first thing they need to write on the draft is the title. Have

them point to the line where they will write the title for their book reports on
Activity Page 12.1. Tell students a good title for a book report can be the title
of the story (i.e., “The Hare and the Hedgehog”).


 - Tell students the first sentences of the book report should introduce the main

character(s) and the setting (specifying where and when it took place). They
should also share the genre of the story.


Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** Have students review the characters, setting, and plot with

a partner. Circulate as students share to help clear up any confusion.


 - Tell students they will write about the plot of the story next, including the
beginning, middle, and end. Tell students they can look back to Activity
Page 11.6 to help them write these sentences about the plot.


 - Remind students to include their opinion or impression of the story.


 - Tell students the ending sentence of their book report should be a focused
summary the report was about and let the reader know the narrative is
finished.


 - Remind students that when writing:


   - A sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a punctuation mark.


   - The first sentence of a paragraph is indented. Model how to start each
paragraph a bit further to the right than the other sentences in the
paragraph.


   - Writing needs to have linking words to describe the sequence of events
( _first_, _next_, _then_, _last_, etc.). Encourage students to use these words when
writing about the plot.


 - Encourage students to look back in their Readers and to use the Individual
Code Chart when writing.


 - Divide students into groups so they can begin writing their book reports.


**Small Group Work**


**Group 1:** Form a group of students who need more support drafting
their story. Begin by writing the title of the book report, “The Hare and

Use guided writing for
students who need help
with generating the writing
piece. Have students
explicitly recite aloud the
sentences they decide to
write for the plot.

share possible starting sentences aloud with you. After you have provided
feedback, have them write the first sentence. Instruct students to work on
the plot next, reminding them of what they need to include. Work one-on-one
if necessary. Have students check in with you before they write their ending
sentence. While students in Group 1 are wrapping up, catch up with Group 2.


**Group 2:** Ask students to write independently to complete the draft
on their own. If students finish quickly, have them sit in pairs and read
their narratives to each other. You may also have them draw a picture to
accompany their book reports.


  - When the time is up, recap for students that they drafted a book report
about “The Hare and the Hedgehog.” Drafting is the second step in the
writing process.


  - In the next lesson, they will edit what they have written. To model how to edit,
you will select one student’s report to share with the class. As a class, you will
discuss what you like about the report and offer suggestions as to how the
author could improve it. Tell students to add a star next to the title of their
draft if they are interested in having their story reviewed by the class.


~~**TEKS 2.11.B.i**~~


Activity Page 12.1: Draft a Narrative Book Report


Collect Activity Page 12.1 and review to determine whether students have included

the title, characters, setting, and plot of the story in their book report on “The Hare

and the Hedgehog.” If students require support or additional time to complete their

drafts, plan to provide that opportunity before the next writing lesson.

Reading

Students will read “The Pancake” with purpose and understanding; will read the
story by answering text-dependent questions, identifying Tier 2 vocabulary, and
discussing challenging portions of the text; and will write three or four sentences
explaining how they can tell the story is fiction. ~~**[TEKS 2.4; TEKS 2.6.A; TEKS 2.8.C]**~~


Students will use context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words.

~~**TEKS 2.3.B**~~


~~**INTRODUCE THE STORY (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that when authors write about objects or animals that act like

real people, this is called personification. For example, if a toothbrush in a
story can sing and dance, the author has used personification.


  - When authors use personification, the story is a fantasy. A fantasy story

includes something magical, like a singing toothbrush or a talking hedgehog.


  - Ask students if they can think of examples of personification from _Bedtime_
_Tales_ stories.


    - Students should respond that “The Hare and the Hedgehog” uses

personification because hedgehogs and hares do not talk, make maps,
and run races.


  - Tell students that in the story “The Pancake, Part I,” the author uses

personification by making the main character, a pancake, talk and run.


  - Show students the picture of the pancake on page 57 of _Bedtime Tales_ . Call
attention to the pancake’s facial expression in the illustration. Based on this
picture, ask students to predict what types of human activities the pancake
might do in the story. _(Based on the pancake’s worried look and the family_
_members holding forks, students may predict the pancake will do something_
_to avoid being eaten. Student’s may make the connection between this story_
_and the well-known fairytale,_ _“The Gingerbread Man.”)_


**TEKS 2.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text; **TEKS 2.6.A** Establish purpose
for reading assigned and self-selected texts; **TEKS 2.8.C** Describe and understand plot elements, including the main events,

**Preview Spellings**

 - Refer to the chart you prepared in advance to preview the sound/spellings
before reading the story.

                  - This story contains /ar/ > ‘ar’ words like started and farmer as well as /ae/ >
‘a_e’ words like scared.


                 - Refer to the /ar/ column on the chart you prepared in advance, and have
students read the words aloud.


                 - Next refer to the /ae/ column on the chart, and have students read the words
aloud as a class. Students may have more difficulty with these particular
/ ae/ words, so help them by circling or pointing to the separated digraphs to
focus students’ attention on the spelling, even though the letter ‘r’ separates
the vowel digraph.


                - Additionally, students may need some guidance in chunking the words into
syllables. You may want to use your hand to cover the second syllable of a
word as students read the first syllable. Then use your hand to cover the first
syllable as students read the second syllable. After both syllables have been
read, ask students to blend and read. (Refer to Appendix B to learn more
about chunking syllables to decode words.)


**Preview Core Vocabulary**

                 - Preview the following vocabulary before reading today’s story.


**grilling—v.,** cooking on a hot surface (56)

Example: My dad is grilling cheese sandwiches to go with our soup.


**outran—v.,** ran faster than someone or something (58)

Example: The winner of the marathon outran all the other runners.


**foot path—n.,** a narrow path for walking (60)

Example: We walked along a foot path to get to the soccer field.


**plowing—v.,** digging up soil (60)

Example: The farmers are plowing the field before they plant the seeds.

  - After students have finished reading “The Pancake, Part I” with their partners,
lead students in the following:


    - ask text-dependent questions that require students to draw on evidence
from the text;


    - identify and discuss general academic (Tier 2) vocabulary;


    - discuss sections of the text that might pose difficulty due to complex
syntax, dense information, challenging transitions, or that require
inferences; and


    - engage students in a culminating writing activity where they write three or
four sentences to explain how they know that this is a fiction story.

                 - Create a set of word cards for each player **(Activity Page TR 12.1)** . Assign
each word a point value based on the difficulty of the word; you may want to
assign one point for one-syllable words, two points for two-syllable words,
three points for three-syllable words, and so on.


                 - Each player gets a preset time limit to attempt to read as many words
as possible within the time. Students get points for the words they read
correctly and get no points for words they misspell or skip.


**Pat the Spelling**

                  - Cut out a long, rectangular slip of paper and write ‘ar’ (as in cart) on each

end. The spellings should face away from each other (see illustration).
Repeat for ‘er’ (as in her).

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Writing**
) **Digital Component 8.3**


  - Prepare to display an enlarged version of the editing checklist (Digital
Component 8.3). Prepare to write on the board/chart paper.


  - Select a student’s draft book report from among students who volunteered
for the task. Copy the student’s draft, including any misspellings or other
errors, onto the board/chart paper, skipping every other line, to leave room
for editing. You may wish to number the sentences using a different color.
This will make it easier to refer to specific parts of the story. The ideal draft
will be one that is good but suitable for improvement in one or more of the
areas listed on the editing checklist (Activity Page 13.1). Also, before the start
of class, alert the student whose work has been chosen. You may wish to ask
the student if he or she would like to be identified or remain anonymous.


) **Digital Component 13.1**


  - Create the Pronoun Cases chart (Digital Component 13.1) on the board/chart
paper, or use the digital version.


**Reading**
) **Digital Component 13.2**


  - Create the Preview Spellings chart (Digital Component 13.2) for Introduce
the Story on the board/chart paper, or use the digital version.


) **Digital Component 1.3**


  - Prepare to update the _Bedtime Tales_ Story Chart that you began in Lesson 1.
Today you will add details from “The Pancake, Part II” to the chart.


**Universal Access**

  - Gather images or plan to demonstrate unfamiliar verbs in “The Pancake,
Part II” (e.g., _snorted_, _clucking_, _squinted_, and _scooped)._

**Primary Focus:** As a group, students will edit a peer’s book report about “The
Hare and the Hedgehog” and will include complete sentences with subject-verb
agreement and make suggestions to the author for improving the draft.


~~**TEKS 2.11.D.i; TEKS 2.11.D.vii**~~


Students will develop handwriting by accurately forming all cursive letters using

~~**EDIT A NARRATIVE BOOK REPORT (15 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.11.D.i**~~


**Review**

                 - Remind students that they first planned and then drafted a book report
about “The Hare and the Hedgehog.” They planned the elements of the book
report on a planning template and then wrote the draft in paragraph format
on a separate sheet of paper.


                  - Tell students today they will work on the third step in writing: editing. Explain
that editing is what we do when we work to make a draft better.


                 - Remind students that you asked them to volunteer if they wanted their book
report to be shared with the class. Explain that you chose one student’s draft
and you copied it on the board/chart paper. The class will tell the author what
they like about the draft and provide a few friendly suggestions that might
help the student make the report even better.


**Present a Student Draft**

                  - Display the student’s draft.


                  - If permitted by the student, identify the author and invite the student to
present his or her book report by reading it out loud. (If the student has not
agreed to be identified, you may read the draft.)


                  - Ask the class to give the author a round of applause: “Let’s hear it for
the author!”


                 - Explain that you would like students to begin by telling the author something
they liked about his or her book report. Model this for the class.


                 - Invite other students to say something they liked about the book report.
Write down these positive comments on the board/chart paper.


**TEKS 2.11.D** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including (i) complete sentences with subject-verb agreement;
(vii) pronouns, including subjective, objective, and possessive cases; **TEKS 2.2.E** Develop handwriting by accurately forming

**Edit the Student Draft**
) **Digital Component 8.3**


 - Point to and read the display copy of the editing checklist (Digital
Component 8.3). Discuss the Tricky Words: _questions_, _title_, _character_,
_middle_, _final_ .


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 13.1. Remind students that this is an
editing checklist. They will use it to edit the chosen author’s draft. The
checklist identifies areas the author might want to improve.


 - Make clear that the entire class is using the editing checklist to edit one
student’s work today. In the future, students will edit their own work.


 - Ask the class if the draft has a title. If so, have students make a check mark
next to the question on the editing checklist.


 - Complete the remaining questions, and discuss whether the item can be
checked—or whether improvements could be made. Model making any
changes to the draft that the class has agreed would be changes for the better.
) **Digital Component 13.1**


 - For item 9 in the checklist, remind students that pronouns are words that can
take the place of nouns. There are three types of pronoun cases: subjective,
objective, and possessive. Project Digital Component 13.1 and discuss the
examples with students.


 - Use the following editing conventions when correcting the draft. Explicitly
call students’ attention to these conventions, explaining this is how
professional writers edit their work. Explain that they will use these very
same conventions when they edit their own work:

   - Cross out punctuation mistakes and write the correct punctuation mark
above the wrong one.

   - Cross out capitalization mistakes and write the correct uppercase/
lowercase letter above the wrong one.

   - Write a caret (^) where a word or punctuation mark needs to be inserted.
Write the word or punctuation mark above the caret.

   - Correct spelling mistakes if students notice or question them. You should
accept phonemically possible spellings for spellings students have not
yet learned.

   - Correct any sentences where the subject and verb do not agree in number.

   - If the draft contains dialogue, discuss how it has to be marked with
quotation marks and make corrections if necessary.


 - You can also ask students if they have any other suggestions to improve the
author’s writing. Explain that students should make suggestions by asking
the author questions.

  - Model this by using an example like this: “I am wondering if we might make
the author’s writing even better if we ?” Using this phrasing will make
it clear the author is being given suggestions for consideration rather than
mandatory changes.


  - If changes are suggested, check with the author to see if he or she likes the
idea. Then make the changes on the board/chart paper. At this stage, two or
three suggestions are probably sufficient.


  - Save this edited draft for use in Lesson 14.

  - Additionally, students may need some guidance in chunking the words into
syllables. You may want to use your hand to cover the second syllable of a
word as students read the first syllable. Then use your hand to cover the first
syllable as students read the second syllable. After both syllables have been
read, ask students to blend and read. (Please refer to Appendix B to learn
more about chunking syllables to decode words.)

  - The goal is to get a set of antonyms.

~~**MORE HELP WITH READING DECODABLE WORDS**~~


**Crazy Eights**

                 - Create a deck of word cards by making a copy of **Activity Pages TR 7.1, 8.2,**
**10.1, 12.1, and 13.2** using a different color for each sheet.


                 - You may also wish to include _skip_, _add_, _draw 1_, _draw 2_, _draw 3_, and
_reverse_ cards.


                  - Give each player five cards to start. Put the rest of the deck in the middle,

and flip the top card over next to the deck. This faceup card becomes the
discard pile.


                  - Taking turns, each student can either play a card that is the same color or
starts with the same letter as the card at the top of the discard pile. To be able
to play a card, a student must correctly read the card or lose his or her turn.


                  - If a student does not have a card that is either the same color or starts with
the same letter as the top card of the discard pile, then he or she can draw
from the deck. If there are no more cards left in the deck, shuffle the discard
pile, which becomes the new deck.


~~**PROGRESS MONITORING (OPTIONAL)**~~


                 - Make a copy of the Word Cards for Progress Monitoring 4 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 13.3** ). Cut apart the word cards.


                - Make one copy of the Record Sheet for Progress Monitoring 4 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 13.4** ) for each student you are assessing.


                 - Model with the sample item.


                 - Show the cards to the student one at a time. Use the record sheet to record
each word as the student reads.


                 - Place a check next to each word read correctly.


                 - For misread words, write exactly what students say as the word is sounded
out. If students misread a word, prompt them to try to read the word again,
letting them know their first attempt was incorrect.


**Scoring:** Scoring is based on one point assigned for every sound/spelling in
a word which is read correctly. Interpret scores as follows:


                        - 14 or 15 points—excellent


Foundational Skills 2
**196**


   - 11–13 points—good


   - 8–10 points—fair


   - Less than 8 points—poor


**Goal:** Achieve scores of good or excellent (11 points or more).


Scores of 10 or less indicate additional reteaching and reinforcement is
required. Further analyze student errors to determine whether there are one
or more particularly problematic sound/spellings. The subtotals for targeted
sound/spellings at the bottom of the record sheet facilitate the identification
of specific problem areas.


Also examine whether there are mispronunciations occurring more
frequently in a given position in words. For example, does the student read
the initial sound correctly, but misread the medial and/or final sound?


Finally, examine whether the student succeeded in reading words correctly
on the second attempt. If so, the student may be rushing and may benefit
from explicit instruction to slow down and look at each letter in a word
sequentially, left to right.


~~**SENTENCES AND PHRASES**~~


 - Use the following list of sentences and phrases to extend your lessons.



1. bride and groom


2. in the groove


3. lost a tooth



4. Three raccoons got in the trash.


5. Soon we will swim in the pool.


6. Add wood to the fire.

Lesson 16 Unit Assessment: Word Recognition, Comprehension, Fluency, and Cursive Writing
**219**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today you will begin the Unit 2 Student Performance Assessment. The first
assessment is a word recognition exercise targeting each of the lettersound correspondences reviewed in Unit 2. The next assessment measures
students’ ability to read a story independently and answer comprehension
questions. Once students have finished reading the story, you will begin
administering the third assessment, a Fluency Assessment. You will work
one-on-one with students to complete the Fluency Assessment. The next
assessment is a Cursive Writing Assessment. You will most likely need more
than one day to test each student; you may plan on using time during the
Pausing Point to finish the Fluency Assessment.


**Reading**

                 - Make one copy of the student copy of “The Fox and the Cat” from Teacher
Resources to use for the Fluency Assessment.

  - The student’s oral response will indicate whether the mistake was a careless

error or if the student needs additional instruction in specific letter-sound
correspondences.


  - Use the Word Recognition Assessment Analysis chart in Teacher Resources
to pinpoint the remediation needed.

Students will read “The Fox and the Cat” with appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy),
and will answer oral literal and inferential questions about key details in the
text. ~~**TEKS 2.4; TEKS 2.6.F**~~


~~**STORY COMPREHENSION ASSESSMENT (15 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.8.C**~~


  - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 16.2 and open _Bedtime Tales_ to “Cat and
Mouse Keep House” on page 89.


  - Note the title has the phrase _keep house_ ; to keep house means the cat and
mouse live together and take care of their house.


  - Students should read the story completely first and then answer the
comprehension questions on Activity Page 16.2.


  - Encourage students who finish quickly to check over their papers. After
checking their papers, they may re-read stories from _Bedtime Tales_ .


Activity Page 16.2: Story Comprehension Assessment


Collect Activity Page 16.2 and correct. A student who correctly answers seven or

more of the comprehension questions is reading Unit 2 text with understanding.


**TEKS 2.8.C** Describe and understand plot elements, including the main events, the conflict, and the resolution, for texts read
aloud and independently; **TEKS 2.6.G** Evaluate details read to determine key ideas; **TEKS 2.4** The student reads grade-level

**TEKS 2.6.F** Make inferences and use evidence to support understanding.



Foundational Skills 2
**222**


A student who correctly answers six questions is borderline; a student who correctly

answers five or less questions is experiencing difficulty.


**Story Comprehension Remediation**

  - For borderline and struggling students, carefully analyze performance on the

Word Recognition Assessment and Fluency Assessment to determine if there
are specific sound/spellings in need of remediation.


~~**FLUENCY ASSESSMENT (25 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.4**~~


You will work individually with each student and take a running record of the
student’s oral reading of the story. This is an opportunity to look for specific
problems any students are having. In addition, you will take a simple, easily
calculated measure of the student’s fluency by seeing how long it takes the
student to read the story. Allow each student approximately three minutes to
read the story. If the student cannot read the story in three minutes, this is a
clear indication he or she is struggling and needs to work on fluency.


**Note:** You may allow more time (up to six minutes) for a student to finish
reading the story. Three minutes is a sufficient amount of time to conduct
the Fluency Assessment, but some students may be frustrated if they do not
have the opportunity to finish reading the story.


If time is an issue, you may choose to assess only students who have
struggled throughout the unit. You may refer to your anecdotal notes to
guide you in choosing which students to assess. If you do decide to work with
each student, you will most likely need more instructional days to complete
the Fluency Assessment.


  - As each student completes the comprehension assessment, ask the student
to join you in a quiet area of the classroom.


  - Ask each student to bring Activity Page 16.3, “The Fox and the Cat,” on which
you’ll mark your running record.


  - Write the student’s name on the activity page. Explain that you are going to
ask the student to read aloud to you.


  - Place the student copy of “The Fox and the Cat” in front of the student.


  - Start a stopwatch or jot down a start time when the student reads the first

word in the story.


**TEKS 2.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text.

Give students a break at
this point in the lesson
by asking them to read
some Wiggle Cards and
perform each action.

Lesson 16 Unit Assessment: Word Recognition, Comprehension, Fluency, and Cursive Writing
**223**


 - As the student reads, take a running record, using the following marking

guidelines. Focus specifically on what a student’s errors reveal about his
or her knowledge of letter-sound correspondences, recording what the
student says.


**Note:** These guidelines for taking running records represent a simplified
version of the process. If you have mastered a different process of annotating
running records, please use the system you know.












|Words read correctly|No mark required.|
|---|---|
|**Omissions**|Draw a long dash above the word_omitted_.|
|**Insertions**|Write a caret (^) at the point where the<br>insertion was made.|
|**Words read**<br>**incorrectly**|Write an ‘X’ above the word and if possible<br>the word the student says.|
|**Self-corrected errors**|Replace original error mark with an ‘SC’.|
|**Teacher supplied**<br>**word**|Write a ‘T’ above the word (counts as an error); provide<br>only if the student hesitates for fve or more seconds<br>or says he or she does not know the word.|




                 - When the student completes the reading, jot down the elapsed time or the

finish time.


                  - Ask the student a few of the following questions about the story to quickly
assess comprehension. Note the student’s answers on the back of Activity
Page 16.3.


Foundational Skills 2
**224**


**Comprehension Questions for “The Fox and the Cat”**


1. **Literal.** Who are the characters of the story?


» The characters in the story are a fox and a cat.


2. **Inferential.** Where were the characters when they were talking?


» The characters were talking at the river.


3. **Literal.** The fox brags that he has many tricks. Can you name some of his tricks?


» He can run, swim, and dig a hole and hide.


4. **Literal.** How many tricks did the cat have?


» The cat had one trick.


5. **Inferential.** When the cat heard hunting dogs, it ran up the tree. What did the fox
do? What happened?


» It could not decide what to do; the dogs got the fox.


6. **Literal.** What is the moral of the story?


» It’s better to have one trick you can count on than a hundred you cannot.

Calculate W.C.P.M. on Activity Page 16.4. You may wish to keep Activity Pages 16.3

and 16.4 in the student’s portfolio for use during family conferences or for

report cards.


**Analysis and Remediation**


**Story Comprehension:** A student who is able to answer five or more of
the comprehension questions adequately has the ability to make sense
of the stories at this point. A student who answers four or less of the
six comprehension questions correctly is experiencing difficulty in fully
understanding what he or she is reading. The student may be expending so
much mental energy on the decoding process that there is not enough left
over to focus on comprehension. In such cases, additional work on fluency,
especially repeated oral readings, is warranted.



Activity Page 16.4



Lesson 16 Unit Assessment: Word Recognition, Comprehension, Fluency, and Cursive Writing
**225**


**Decoding Accuracy:** If the student makes more than six uncorrected
mistakes, he or she is having problems with word recognition and may need
additional practice decoding specific spellings. Look at specific errors on
the Word Recognition Assessment and other past assignments to pinpoint
weaknesses. During the Pausing Point, provide this student with practice to
remediate any identified weaknesses.


**Fluency:** Assess fluency by comparing the student’s reading time with
the times listed in the table at the bottom of the Activity Page. Students
struggling with fluency need more practice re-reading stories, and may
benefit from previewing of vocabulary before reading as well. A score below
the 50th percentile may be cause for concern; a score below the 25th
percentile is definite cause for concern.

Pausing Point


This is the end of Unit 2. Once you have administered the Unit Assessment in
Lesson 16, analyze the results to determine if students are having difficulty
with particular skills taught in this unit. If this is the case, it would be wise to
pause here and spend four or five days providing targeted remediation in the
specific areas of weakness. This is also a good time to expand the abilities of
students who are able to go further and need a challenge.

**Note to Teacher**


It will be most efficient to group students who have similar needs. This way
students may work on similar activities in small groups, while you rotate
from group to group. For example, you may have one group needing more
practice with spelling alternatives, another needing practice with tricky
spellings, and yet another group needing to review Tricky Words. Of course, if
many students would benefit from a review of the same skill or concept, do
the activity as a whole group review.


Select activities best suited for whatever difficulties were identified on the
assessments. Students may do any combination of the activities provided, in
any order.


Foundational Skills 2
**230**


For students who need extra practice with **reading** :


  - Use chaining games requiring students to translate symbols into sounds.


  - Have students play a Wiggle Cards game.


  - Have students read the words and phrases provided in the Additional
Support sections of the lessons.


  - Have students read/re-read stories, especially if fluency was a problem on

the Fluency Assessment.


For students who need extra practice with **spelling and writing** :


  - Use chaining games requiring students to translate from sound to print.


  - Use dictation exercises, beginning with the most scaffolded ones and moving
on to more independent ones. Focus mostly on one-syllable words and add
longer and more complicated words gradually.


For students who need extra practice with **vowel digraphs**, try chaining
games and other games listed. Select words and chains containing digraphs.


For students who need more work with **separated digraphs**, do
Pop-Out Chaining.


For students who need extra practice with **Tricky Words**, try Tricky Word
Practice or Dictation with Words (using Tricky Words).


Continue to encourage students to use the Individual Code Chart when
writing. Spelling accuracy will improve over time as students have more
writing experience and repeated exposure to the spelling alternatives.

~~**TRANSITION TIMES**~~


**Wiggle Cards**


If students enjoy reading and acting out the Wiggle Cards, you may want to
add the following to your inventory of Wiggle Cards. Feel free to pull from this
stack of cards any time during the day, not just the Language Arts period,
when students need an active transition.



1. Stare at me.


2. Shake a fist.


3. Kneel.


4. Sweep up a mess.


5. Tug on one sleeve.


6. Look up.


7. Swing your left foot.



8. Grab a tooth.


9. Bounce up and down.


10. Slouch.


11. Count to ten.


12. Shout your name.


13. Lift an arm.


14. Beat a drum.


15. Scream without making a noise.



~~**MORE HELP WITH RHYMING WORDS**~~


Support students’ understanding of producing a series of rhyming words by
asking them to identify the first sound and the ending sound of a word, such
as _book._


                 - Invite students to close their eyes and repeat the word. Isolate the beginning
sound of the word if needed and repeat; say /b/ /oo/ /k/.


                 - Tell students to find a rhyming word(s), we need to change the first sound

and keep the ending sound (e.g., _cook, took_ ).


                 - Direct students to the alphabet posted in the classroom to use as a reference
for beginning sounds.


                 - Invite students to use blends and digraphs they have learned to make
rhymes (e.g., _crook, brook, shook_ ).


                 - Repeat this process with the word _root._ ~~**T E KS 2 .2 .A.i**~~


**TEKS 2.2.A.i** Demonstrate phonological awareness by producing a series of rhyming words.


Foundational Skills 2
**232**


~~**MORE HELP WITH SOUND/SPELLINGS**~~


**Vowel Code Flip Book Review**

 - Point to vowel spellings in the Vowel Code Flip Book and ask students to say
the sounds.


 - Say (or sing) a vowel sound and ask students to locate and point to the spelling.


 - Ask students to point to single-letter spellings for vowel sounds, digraph
spellings for vowel sounds, and separated digraphs.


**Mark the Vowel Spellings**

 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page PP.1.


 - Ask students to read each word and circle the letter or letters for the vowel
sound in the word.


 - The words on the front of the sheet have one syllable, so there is only one

vowel spelling to find in each word. The words on the back have two syllables,
so there are two vowel spellings to find in each word.


**Count the Sounds**

 - Have students turn to Activity Page PP.2.


 - Remind students some sound/spellings consist of more than one letter
(letter teams, digraphs, or trigraphs).


 - Tell students to count and mark the sounds in each word.


 - Have students write the number of sounds in the box.


 - Tell students to copy the words onto the lines.


**Choose the Word**

 - Have students turn to Activity Page PP.3.


 - There are two words written above each picture.


 - Tell students to circle the word that matches the picture and print it on the
line below the picture.


**Circle Spelling**

 - Have students look at Activity Page PP.4.


 - For each picture, have students circle the letters that spell the name of
the picture.


 - Tell students to write the name of the item on the line.

**Teacher Chaining**

 - Write _hook_ on the board.


 - Ask a student to read the word, first in a segmented fashion and
then blended.


 - Remove ‘k’ and add ‘d’ to create _hood_ .


 - As you make this change, say to students, “If that is _hook_, what is this?”


 - Continue this process with the remaining words.


1. hook > hood > good > wood > weed > seed > seen > see


2. too > tooth > tool > toil > boil > foil > fool > food > feed > feet > foot


3. hook > hood > had > hand > hound > sound > sand

 - Say to the class/small group, “If this is _hook_, which letter do I need to change
in order to make _hood_ ? Who can show me?” (Select a student to come to the
board and point to the letter.)


 - Say, “Who knows the letter we need instead of the letter ‘k’?” (Select a
student to come to the board and change the ‘k’ to a ‘d’.)


 - Repeat this process with the remaining words.


**Note:** You may use any of the chains listed under Teacher Chaining.


**Chaining Dictation**

 - Have students take out a pencil and a piece of paper.


 - Tell students you are going to say a number of words. Each new word will
be very similar to the previous word, but one sound will be different. (For
example, _map_ might be changed to _sap._ )


 - Tell students to write each word.


 - As you move from one word to the next, use the chaining phrase, “If that is
_fan_, show me _fin_ .”


 - Use any of the chains listed under Teacher Chaining.


~~**MORE HELP WITH VOWEL DIGRAPHS**~~


**Vowel-Consonant-‘e’: Color the Pumpkin**

 - Have students turn to Activity Page PP.7.


 - Ask students to read each word on the page. Then tell students to color the
/ae/ words brown and the /ie/ words orange.


**Vowel-Consonant-‘e’: Separated Digraph**

 - Have students turn to Activity Page PP.8.


 - Explain that each of the black lines on the page stands for one letter.


 - Have students look at the example at the top of the page.


 - Say the word _mad_, and ask students to tell you the vowel sound (/a/).

 - Explain the letters ‘a’ and ‘e’ are working together even though they are not right
next to each other. Tell students we call this kind of spelling a separated digraph.


 - Circle each spelling in _made_ as you say its sound. Draw a horseshoe-shaped
loop around the ‘a’ and the ‘e’ to show these two letters work together to
stand for the /ae/ sound. (See Lesson 1 for an example of drawing a
horseshoe-shaped loop.)


 - Point to each spelling in _made_ as you say its sound: “/m/” (point to the letter

/m/ with your index finger); “/ae/” (simultaneously point to the letter ‘a’ with
your index finger and the letter ‘e’ with your middle finger); “/d/” (point to the
letter ‘d’ with your index finger).

spellings should face away from each other (see illustration). Repeat for ‘oo’
(as in _soon_ ), ‘oo’ (as in _look_ ), and ‘u’. (Make eyes on one of the ‘oo’ slips to
represent /oo/ as in _look_ .)


 - Place the slips of paper in a row on the floor between two students who are
facing each other.


 - Tell students you will say different vowel sounds and you want students to
slap the spelling for that sound as fast as possible. Explain that the /oo/
sound is shown with eyes to show that this ‘oo’ represents the sound in _look_
rather than in _soon_ .


 - **Extension** : Once students are successful at distinguishing the sounds in
isolation, have them listen for the vowel sound embedded in the words
that follow.

~~**LESSON 10: SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


  - Write students’ names in the column provided.


  - Place an X in the column of any word students did not spell correctly. If you notice students are
making errors in the medial vowel sounds of the words in this list, you will want to examine those
errors for patterns. For example, is the student missing all of the /ae/ sounds? There are many
activity pages in the Pausing Point for practice. You may wish to target certain items or have students
complete the whole sheet with your guidance.


  - If students made errors on the word _hopping_ by failing to double the final consonant, then you may
need to review the short vowel followed by a consonant rule with these students. After students see
the pattern of only one letter to make the short sound, then guide them through doubling the last
consonant to keep the vowel sound and adding the suffix _–ing_ .


  - Other errors students may make is failing to drop the ‘e’ before adding in the _–ing_ . You will want to
review the rules of long vowel spelling patterns with students by using Pausing Point exercises.

**The Fox and the Cat**


Once a fox and a cat were drinking from a river.


The fox started bragging.


“I am a clever one,” said the fox. “There are lots of beasts out there that
would like to eat me, but they can’t catch me. I have lots of tricks that help
me escape from them. I can run. I can swim. I can dig a hole and hide. Why,
I must have a hundred clever tricks!”


“I have just one trick,” said the cat. “But it is a good one.”


“Just one?” said the fox. “That’s all? Well, that is too bad for you!”


Just then there was a loud sound. It was the sound of barking dogs. A
hunter was leading a pack of hunting dogs by the side of the river.


The cat scampered up a tree and hid in the leaves.


“This is my plan,” said the cat. “What are you going to do?”


The fox started thinking which of his tricks he should use. Should he
run? Should he swim? Should he dig a hole and hide? He had such a long list
of tricks. It was hard to pick just one. But while he was thinking, the hunter
and his dogs were getting nearer and nearer. Soon they spotted the fox and
then it was too late.


The cat said, “It’s better to have one trick you can count on than a
hundred you can’t.”

Background Information
for Vowel Spellings
and Sounds


~~**“LONG” VOWELS AND SEPARATED DIGRAPHS**~~


The vowel sounds: /ae/, /ee/, /ie/, /oe/, and /ue/ have traditionally been called the “long” vowels and are
also letter names: /ae/ = ‘a’, /ee/ = ‘e’, /ie/ = ‘i’, /oe/ = ‘o’, /ue/ = ‘u’.


The spellings ‘a_e’, ‘ee’, ‘i_e’, ‘o_e’, and ‘u_e’ are taught as the basic code spellings for these sounds because
they are the least ambiguous spellings.


The ‘ee’ spelling for /ee/ is a vowel digraph analogous to the consonant digraphs students have
already learned (‘ch’, ‘sh’, ‘ng’, etc.). The spellings for the sounds /ae/, /ie/, /oe/, and /ue/ are also
digraphs, but they are digraphs of a different sort. They are _separated digraphs._ The two letters
work together to stand for a single sound, but the letters no longer sit next to each other. Instead,
they are separated from each other by another spelling. This intervening spelling will always be a
consonant spelling and it will usually be a single-letter spelling. For example, in words like _tame_, _tide_,
_tone_, and _cute_, a single letter stands between the two letters of the vowel digraph. There are few
words in English where a consonant digraph stands between the two letters of a separated vowel
digraph; _ache_ is one of the very few examples.


It is important for students to understand that two letters can work together to represent a single
sound even if the letters are separated. This is likely to be difficult for some students to grasp. Even
those who grasp the idea quickly may need time to automatize the procedure during reading, as it
involves a significant departure from the left-to-right decoding used to read most words. Students
have been taught to read from left to right, but in order to read words with separated digraphs, they
need scan to the right and then glance back again to the left.


To get a sense of how the need for complex mental operations increases as the sequence of instruction
progresses, consider what is involved in reading the following three words: _ham_, _sham_, _shame_ . To read _ham_,
the reader needs to inspect each letter, remember which sound each letter stands for, and then blend the
three sounds together. To read _sham_, the reader must do all of these things as well as recognize that ‘s’ and ‘h’
are a letter team. The reader may need to discard a first impression that the word begins with two consonant
sounds, /s/ followed by /h/. To read _shame_, the reader must perform the above-mentioned tasks while also
scanning ahead, spotting the letter ‘e’, connecting the letter ‘e’ to the letter ‘a’, and remembering that these


Appendix A
**359**


**360**



letters stand for the /ae/ sound. When you add all of these tasks together, you have a rather complicated
procedure, one that takes lots of practice to automatize.


As adults and skilled readers, it is very hard for us to place ourselves in the mindset of the young
learner. To get a sense of what reading must be like for a beginning reader, write the word _shine_ on
a piece of paper and cover it with a second sheet. Pretend that you do not already know what word
the slip of paper conceals. Slowly slide the paper to the right, revealing one letter at a time. If you
think out loud, your thinking might sound something like this: “The first sound is /s/. The next sound
is /h/. No wait, those two letters stand for just one sound: /sh/. The next sound is /i/: /sh/ /i/.
The next sound is /n/, making /sh/ /i/ /n/. The last sound is /e/: /sh/ /i/ /n/ /e/. But wait, _shinn-_
_eh_ isn’t a word. Oh, I see, the letter ‘i’ and the letter ‘e’ are working together to stand for the / ie/
sound. The word is /sh/ /ie/ /n/!” As they encounter new words, students are performing a set of
mental actions very much like these. They are segmenting the written symbols into chunks, trying
to match those chunks to sounds, blending, correcting initial assumptions, connecting separated
digraphs, and scanning forward and backward as needed. All of this requires a lot of mental energy—
especially for readers who are just learning to crack the alphabet code.


~~**SILENT ‘E’ AND MAGIC ‘E’**~~


Spellings like ‘a_e’ and ‘i_e’ are referred to as _separated digraphs_ . You may also use the term _split_
_digraph_ if you prefer. In years past you may have spoken of the ‘e’ in words like _name_ or _note_ as a
_silent_ ‘ _e_ ’. Or you may have used the term _magic_ ‘ _e_ ’. Of these two terms, _magic_ ‘ _e_ ’ is preferred. There
are a few issues in telling students some letters are silent. In truth, all letters are silent. (If they
could speak, we would not have to read them and turn them back into sounds.) Also the phrase
_silent letter_ may lead some students to believe that only some letters in a word matter as far as
determining the pronunciation of the word whereas others have no purpose. In fact, the ‘e’ in _kite_
is every bit as important in terms of determining pronunciation as the ‘i’. Without the ‘e’, the word
would be pronounced _kit_ .


All in all, the notion of _magic_ ‘ _e_ ’ better reflects the role of ‘e’ in these spellings _._ You are encouraged
to avoid teaching the concept of _silent_ ‘ _e_ ’ or other silent letters. For example, in the word _light_, it is
more useful to think of ‘igh’ as a three-letter spelling (a trigraph) for /ie/ than it is to think of ‘i’ as
standing for /ie/ and ‘gh’ as being “silent.” If you think of all of the letters in a word as being part of a
spelling, then there is no need to introduce the concept of “silent” letters.


For the same reason, you are strongly discouraged from using the popular phonics jingle “when
two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking.” Statistical analyses indicate this rule is only
correct about 50% of the time. Moreover, it misleads students into thinking vowels are letters,
whereas in fact vowels are sounds. Finally, it suggests students only need to pay attention to the
first letter in a vowel digraph. That is very bad advice. To be effective readers, students need to look
at both letters in a digraph spelling. They need to pay attention to the ‘a’ and the ‘w’ in _law_, the ‘o’
and the ‘i’ in _oil_, and the ‘a’ and the ‘e’ in _name_ .


Foundational Skills 2


~~**SIMILAR SOUNDS: /UE/, /OO/, /OO/, AND /U/**~~


There is a lot of potential for confusion regarding the four vowel sounds /ue/, /oo/, /oo/, and /u/.


  - The /ue/ sound as in _cute_ is similar to the /oo/ sound as in _boot_ . In fact,
/ue/ actually contains the /oo/ sound. /ue/ is really a sound combination; it can be described as /y/
+ /oo/.


  - The sound /oo/ as in _soon_ is also somewhat similar to /oo/ as in _look_, and the confusion between
these sounds is magnified by the fact that they share a single basic-code spelling.


  - The sound /oo/ as in _look_ can also be confused with /u/ as in _luck_ .


The sounds /ue/, /oo/, /oo/, and /u/ share a whole set of spellings, as you can see from the table
below. The bold words in each column indicate the basic code spelling for that sound.

~~**VOWEL + /R/ COMBINATIONS**~~


This program treats /er/, /ar/, and /or/ as single r-controlled vowel sounds. You may be surprised
to see these sounds treated as vowel sounds rather than vowel + consonant combinations. In many
older phonics programs, these would have been taught as vowel + consonant combinations.


Appendix A
**361**


**362**



This program classifies the two sounds in _ear_ not as a single r-controlled vowel sound but as a
combination: /ee/ + /r/. This is done for two reasons. First, the two elements of this combination
can be separated quite cleanly into /ee/ and /r/. Second, the spelling patterns for /ee/ when it
occurs before /r/ are, by and large, the same ones used for /ee/ in other positions. If the sound
combination /ee/ + /r/ were routinely written with entirely different spellings, that would be a good
argument for teaching it as a separate unit. However, most words with this sound combination
belong in one of the spelling categories for /ee/. Words like _deer_ fall into the /ee/ spelled ‘ee’ group
along with _deep_ and _steep_ . Words like _near_ fit into the /ee/ spelled ‘ea’ group along with _neat_ and
_heap_ . Words like _here_ can be seen as members of the /ee/ spelled ‘e_e’ group along with _Pete_ and
_Eve_ . Words like _Erie_ can be seen as members of the /ee/ spelled ‘e’ group along with _even_ and _Eden_ .
Therefore, the /ee/ + /r/ combination is treated as two sounds, each of which can be spelled using
the spellings for that sound.


This program classifies the final sounds in _hair_ not as a single r-controlled vowel sound but as /ae/
+ /r/. Again, this program chose this classification because the two parts can be cleanly separated,
and because the spellings used for /ae/ when it precedes /r/ are, by and large, the same ones used
for /ae/ in other positions: _dare_ follows the same pattern as _date_, and _lair_ follows the same pattern
as _paid_ .


In this program, the initial sounds in _error_ and the middle sounds in _very_ are not classified as single
r-controlled vowel sounds, but as /e/ + /r/. This is perhaps the most complicated and debatable
of the classifications noted here. It is debatable for two reasons. First, there are some linguists
who view this as a single sound. Second, the /e/ + /r/ combination heard in _very_ can be difficult
to distinguish from the /ae/ + /r/ combination heard in _hairy_ . Depending on the dialect, it can also
be difficult to hear a difference between _very_ and _vary_ ; _marry_ and _merry_ ; and _ferry_ and _fairy_ . Many
people cannot hear any differences in these pairs and therefore regard the pairs as homophones.
Others detect a subtle acoustic difference. In this program, /e/ + /r/ and /ae/ + /r/ are viewed
as separate, not because they sound different but because they follow different spelling patterns.
It is noted that most /ae/ + /r/ words can be sorted into one of the spelling patterns for the /ae/
phoneme. The same is true of /e/ + /r/ words: _very_ can be seen as an example of the /e/ spelled
‘e’ pattern seen in _Betty_ and _red_ . The word _bear_ can be seen as an example of the /e/ spelled ‘ea’
spelling pattern seen in _bread_ and _head_ . This is the classification scheme used in this program.


Words like _very_ and _America_ pose one additional problem. The letters ‘er’ can stand either for the
single phoneme /er/ as in _her_ and _letter_ or for the combination /e/ + /r/ as in _very_ and _America_ . The
program draws attention to this issue at a later time.


This information about the gray areas concerning vowels and /r/ is provided only for your
background knowledge, to provide a perspective on the philosophy of the program so you may
teach it more effectively. It might also help you to identify the patterns in the errors students make.
You may wish to give students a general sense that the /r/ sound has a tendency to change vowel
sounds when it follows them—they may need to pronounce some vowel + /r/ words in different ways
in order to read them correctly.


Foundational Skills 2


~~**THE TRICKY SPELLING LESSONS**~~


Tricky Spelling Lessons are used to explicitly call students’ attention to a spelling that can be
pronounced and read more than one way. For example, ‘a’ can be pronounced as /a/ ( _cat_ ), /ae/
( _paper_ ), /o/ ( _father_ ) or / ə / ( _about_ ). It may be helpful to think of a tricky spelling as an instance in
which several sounds “vie” for the student to pronounce and read the spelling a different way:





In a Tricky Spelling Lesson, the teacher calls explicit attention to many examples of words in which
the same spelling is pronounced different ways. Students are taught to try each pronunciation that
they have learned for a spelling until they recognize a particular pronunciation as a familiar word
that makes sense in the context. Some tricky spellings are taught in Grade 1, with many more taught
in Grade 2.


~~**TRICKY SPELLING 'OO'**~~


There is only one tricky spelling introduced in this unit, the spelling ‘oo’, which is the basic code
spelling for the /oo/ sound as in _soon_ (sometimes called the “long” sound) and also for the /oo/
sound as in _look_ (sometimes called the “short” sound). Remember, a tricky spelling is a spelling that
can be sounded or pronounced more than one way. When students come across a word containing
this spelling, they should first try to pronounce the letters as /oo/. (This is the more common
pronunciation.) If that pronunciation does not sound right, or does not make sense in the context,
they should try to pronounce the letters as /oo/. Students will have an opportunity to practice
pronouncing this tricky spelling both ways in this unit.

**Grade 2 | Foundational Skills 2**
Appendix B: Using
Chunking to Decode
Multisyllable Words


Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught in this program will enable students to
read one-syllable words with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences
is no guarantee that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllable words. To
this end, most students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk and
read parts of words—syllables—as a way to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can then
be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated and students are expected
to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, this program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the easiest
two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is already a
familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In addition, each
syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing_, _hunt·er_, _bust·ed_ ). The
dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain double-letter
spellings for consonants, in this program, the divider is typically placed after the double-letter
spelling rather than between the two consonants (e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers familiar
with other ways to chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is done, however,
because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single-spelling units since Kindergarten
(‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.). This program strives to be consistent in representing these
spellings in the way that the students have been taught to process them (e.g., as whole entities
for a sound). (Ultimately, as students become more proficient at decoding and chunking syllables
through subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually chunk and decode
these words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding these two-syllable
words consisting of root words and suffixes relatively easy.


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable words.


Foundational Skills 2


To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


  - **Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound**
**(e.g., /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/):** _let,_ _pad,_ _rod,_ _tin,_ _fun,_ _pic·nic,_ _un·til_


  - **Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/,**
**/ie/, /oe/, /ue/):** _cake,_ _home,_ _like,_ _mule,_ _Pete, mis·take, stam·pede_


  - **Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint,_ _speak,_ _proud,_ _play, dis·may, be·low,_ _coun·sel_


  - **R-Controlled Syllables:** _art,_ _curb,_ _girl,_ _fort,_ _clerk,_ _tur·nip, ar·tist, fe·ver_


  - **Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /ie/,**
**/oe/, /ue/):** _go,_ _me,_ _hi,_ _a·pron, f·nal, com·pre·hend_


  - **Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple, puz·zle, raf·fe, ca·ble, ri·fe_


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


  - **Schwa Syllables:** _ben·e·fit, ap·pe·tite, a·bout, hos·pit·al,_ _e·mo·tion_


**Note:** The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately because
of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


**To be clear, in order to decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these**
**names. The names of the syllable types are provided here only to establish a common**
**vocabulary for teachers as they use the materials.** What is necessary, however, for students to
become fluent readers of longer words in increasingly complex text is that they be able to visually
parse certain spelling patterns as syllable chunks so they can quickly and easily decode each
syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in Kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


  - When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.


_ad · mit_ _nap · kin_ _trum · pet_


Appendix B
**365**


**366**




 - For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed after the
double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is one because the
double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units since Kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’

  - /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).


_traff · ic_ _muff · in_ _happ · en_


 - When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.


_mon · ster_ _con · tract_ _pil · grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read
the first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model
for students how to blend the two syllables aloud:


In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the magic
‘E’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


 - Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for
closed syllables:


_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


In Grade 2, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to use
a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying each
possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


Foundational Skills 2


  - When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:


_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_


However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There is
no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be flexible
and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to determine
whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. In order to recognize
whether a word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has
heard before (i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent
an additional challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a
second language.


  - If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:


_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is fairly straightforward.


  - When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings in
the words.


Appendix B
**367**


**368**



_ban · gle_ _twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_


In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings represent
the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a combination of stressed
and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed or weakly stressed, its
vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that linguists call a schwa.
This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’ and ‘tion’.
Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite challenging for
many students.


 - Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the
schwa sound has a particular spelling:


_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is actually a schwa syllable, but it is identified
separately because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


 - Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables accordingly
throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _tri·cycle_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness_ _help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten—
Grade 3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will
have the tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.
