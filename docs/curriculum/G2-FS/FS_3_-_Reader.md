visit with kids who _excel_ at what they do .


When you _excel_ at something, you are good at it .


The kids I visit all excel at different things . Some of
them excel at sports like running or jumping .



2


Some of them excel at math . Some of them excel at
skipping rocks or standing on their hands . All of them
are good at something .


I visit with the kids . I chat with them . I ask them
how they got started doing what they do and how they
got good at it . Sometimes I chat with their moms and
dads, too . I jot down notes and take snapshots . Then I
write up what they tell me so I can share it with you .


In _Kids Excel_ you will meet a lot of kids who excel .
I had fun meeting them . I think you will like meeting
them, too .


When I meet someone who excels at something, it
inspires me to be as good as I can be . I hope the kids in
_Kids Excel_ have the same effect on you, too!

### **The Spelling Bee**

This past spring I went to see the state spelling bee .


The state spelling bee is a spelling contest that lasts
two days . On Day 1, a bunch of kids sit down to take
a written spelling test . On Day 2, the kids who do the




A person will say a word . Then the speller has to
spell the word one letter at a time . If the speller spells
the word without a mistake, they get to keep spelling .
If the speller makes a mistake, a bell rings .


_Ding!_


Once the bell rings, that is the end . The speller is




experts I spoke with said she had a good chance of
winning .

Amber Hunter was out of the bee . That left just
Gail Day and Carlos Lopez . 



7


a champ . But Miss Day was in fine form, too .


Mister Lopez was given a word to spell . He spelled
the word in the air with his finger . Then he spelled it
out loud .



8


she spelled it without a problem .


That’s the way it went . Mister Lopez spelled a word .
Then Miss Day spelled one . Lopez, Day . Lopez, Day .
Back and forth . Back and forth .



9


Mister Lopez went word-for-word and letter-for-letter
with Miss Day for ten words, until, at last, he was given
the word _penicillin_ . He tugged on his lip and shifted
from foot to foot . He stood there thinking . Time went
by . At last he took a shot at spelling the word .


He spelled it: _p-e-n-i-c-i-l-i-n._ (He left out one ‘l’ .)


_Ding!_ The bell rang .


Mister Lopez was upset . He clenched his hand and
winced .



10


the spelling bee . She would have to spell _penicillin_ .
Then she would have to spell one last word .


Miss Day took aim and spelled: _p-e-n-i-c-i-l-l-i-n._


No bell rang .


The last word was _anesthetic_ .


Miss Day was thinking . Then she spelled:
_a-n-e-s-t-h-e-t-i-c_ .


No bell rang . Gail Day was the winner!



11


Mister Lopez was the runner-up, just as he was at

the prize .


She was the queen of the bee! 



12


13


Was she born to spell?


Were her parents spelling champs? Did they start
training Gail to spell when she was just a babe?


Nope .


I went to West Beach to meet Gail and her parents
a week after the bee . Gail’s parents met me in the
driveway .



14


Gail’s mom, Karen Day, is an artist who paints and
works with clay . Gail’s dad, David Day, drives a truck .
They are as nice a pair as you will ever meet . But they
are not spelling champs .


“Spelling was not my best subject,” Karen explained
as we sat in the living room of their house on Davis
Street .


“I was not bad at spelling,” she added, “but I was
not the best in my class .”


David Day broke into a big grin . “Let’s just say I’m
not a spelling champ like Gail! It seems like she never
makes a mistake!”



15


Karen and Gail smiled .


Karen whispered to me, “When we were dating,
David used to write me notes . They were so cute, but
there were some spelling mistakes in them .”


“When could you tell Gail was a hot shot at
spelling?” I asked .


“Well,” David said, “I could tell she was good at it,
but I did not see just how good she was for a long time .
Shucks, I am so proud of her!”


“When I look back on it,” Karen Day said, “it seems
to me it all started in second grade, when Gail was in
Miss Baker’s class .”


Gail nodded and said, “It was Miss Baker who got
me started . Miss Baker was the best!” 



16


17


I asked her, “How did this Miss Baker make you
into a good speller?”


“Well,” said Gail, “Miss Baker had a cool way of
explaining English spelling . She made spelling trees .”


“Spelling trees?”


“Yes,” said Gail . “Here, I’ll make one for you .”


Gail got a sheet of paper and made a tree .



18


“The trunk stands for a sound, like the sound /ae/ as
in _cake_ . The branches stand for the spellings for that
sound . There’s one branch for words with the ‘a_e’
spelling like _flame_ and _stake_ . There’s one branch for
words that have the ‘ay’ spelling like _play_ and _stay_ .
There’s one branch for words that have the ‘ai’ spelling
like _pain_ and _train_ . And so on . Get it?”


“Got it .”



19


sound . Then we kids would add words to it . When we
found words with the sound in them we would stick
the words on the branches of the tree . We would stick
all of the words with the ‘ai’ spelling on this branch . We
would stick all of the words with the ‘ay’ spelling on
that branch .”


“I see . And this helped you get better at spelling?”


Gail nodded .



20


“The spelling trees helped us see the patterns and keep
track of the spellings . They helped us see which spellings
are used a lot and which ones are used less . There were a
lot of good spellers in Miss Baker’s class .”


“But not all of them went on to win the state
spelling bee,” I said . “Why did you?”


Gail shrugged .


“I was good at spelling . But I did not understand
why English spelling was so hard . Once I asked Miss
Baker why it was so hard . ‘Miss Baker,’ I said, ‘why
are there five or six spellings for some sounds? That
makes no sense . Why isn’t there just one spelling for a
sound?’”


Miss Baker explained as much as she could . Then
she gave me a book on spelling . It was a cool book . It
explained how English has taken in lots of spellings
from French, Latin, Greek, and Spanish . When I
finished that book, Miss Baker gave me a longer book .
Then I found the next book by myself . One book sort
of led to the next . So that’s how I got started .” 



21


Kim is sixteen . Val is fifteen . The sisters swim for
the Red River Swim Program (RRSP) . Both of them
are fast . In fact, they are two of the fastest swimmers in
the state .


I went to see the two sisters at the pool where they
swim . They were training for a big meet .


“So,” I said, “do I dare ask which of you is faster?”



22


“50?” I said . “Is that 50 feet?”


“No,” said Kim, “it’s 50 yards .”


“Gosh!” I said . “50 yards? That’s a sprint? It sounds
long to me! You see, I am not much of a swimmer .”


“The 50 Free is an all-out sprint,” Kim said . “It’s
like the hundred-yard dash in track . It’s over in a flash .
The 100 Free is a sprint, too .”



23


“The 500 Free is a long race,” Kim groaned . “It’s
too long for me . I start to get tired after 150 yards or
so . But not Val! The longer the race is, the better she
is .”


“The 500 Free is my best race!” said Val .


“500 yards?” I said . “What’s that, a hundred laps?”


“Um, no,” Val said . “In a 25-yard pool, it’s up and
back ten times .”


I jotted notes in my notebook .



24


race . Kim is good at the short races . 500 yards is a long
race . Val is good at the long races . Is there a race that is
longer than 100 yards and shorter than 500?”


“Yes, there is,” said Kim . “The 200 Free .”


“So which of you speedsters wins that race?” I
asked .


Kim looked at Val . She had a smile on her face . It
was a sister-to-sister smile, and there was something
else in it . There was a sort of challenge in the look .



25


Val smiled back . She had the same look on her face .


I waited .


At last Kim spoke . “It’s hard to say who is faster
in the 200 Free . Sometimes Val wins and sometimes I
win .”


“I see,” I said . “It sounds like the 200 Free is the
race to see . When will that race take place?”


“It will be on Sunday,” said Val, “the last day of the
state meet .”


I got out my pen and wrote: “Sunday the 25th . 200
Free . Castro versus Castro!” 



26


27


the pool and started swimming . Kim jumped in Lane
3 . Val jumped in Lane 9 .


“Why don’t they both swim in the same lane?” I
asked RRSP coach, Stan Pibwell .


“They don’t have the same training program,” Coach
Pibwell explained . “Kim is a sprinter . Val swims the
longer races, like the 500 . The races are not the same,
so the training is not the same .”



28


forth .


“When will she get to stop?” I asked .


“Not for a while,” said the coach . “Val is training hard
for the big meet . She has been swimming a lot of yards .
In a week or so she will start to swim less so that her
arms and legs feel loose and rested for the big meet . But
it’s not time for her to taper off yet . This morning she
has a lot of yards to swim .”



29


“Do I dare ask what counts as a lot?”


“She’s been swimming 7,000 or 8,000 yards a day,”
said the coach .


“Yikes!” I said . “That’s like five miles!”


“Yep,” said Coach Pibwell . “That’s what it takes to be
the best .”


“When she finishes swimming, will she get to go
home and sleep?”


“Nope! Later on, after she gets out of the pool, she
will do bench presses and leg presses . She will do
sit-ups and chin-ups .”


“Oh man,” I moaned . “It makes me tired just to hear
all of that!”


“It’s like they say: there’s no gain without pain!” said
Coach Pibwell . 



30


31


Kim and the rest of the sprinters were training . They
were not swimming lap after lap like Val . They were
practicing their starts .


“Swimmers, take your marks!” a coach yelled .


Kim and the rest of the sprinters bent down . They
grabbed the starting blocks with their fingers .


“Hup!” yelled the coach .



32


sprang like a cat . Her hands seemed to make a hole in
the pool . Then her arms and her legs went in the same
hole .


Kim went under . She started kicking her legs . Then
she popped up and started swimming like a fish . She
took five fast strokes . Then she stopped . She swam
to the side of the pool, got out, and went back to the
starting blocks .



33


34


35


“She should win that, too .”


“And the 200?” I asked .


Coach Pibwell smiled .


“Well,” he said, “the 200 Free should be one heck
of a race . Kim could win all three, the 50, the 100, and
the 200 . That’s her goal . But Val will be swimming that
race, too .”



36


Coach Pibwell looked to see if Kim was looking .
She was not . Then he whispered, “I think Val gets a
kick out of swimming faster than her big sister . And
she has been training hard . The 200 is like a short jog
for her . So it should be a good race!”


I got out my notebook . I looked at the page where I
had written: “Sunday the 25th . 200 Free . Castro versus
Castro!” I underlined it twice . 



37


parents .


“I am so proud of Kim and Val,” said Grover
Castro . “But I have a bad case of nerves . I hate it when
the two of them swim in the same race . They have both
been training so hard . They would both like to win this
race . But they can’t both win . I don’t like to think that
one of them may be upset .”


A man’s booming voice filled the air . “It’s time for
the last race of the meet!” the man said .



38


“Let’s meet our swimmers!” The man started listing
the swimmers in the race .


“In Lane 2,” he said, “from Red River Swim
Program, we have the winner of the 500 Free, Val
Castro .” Cheers rose up from the RRSP swimmers on
the deck and from fans in the stands .


“In Lane 3,” the man said, “from Red River Swim
Program, the winner of the 50 and 100 Free, Kim
Castro .” There were shouts and cheers for Kim, as well .



39


marks .” The swimmers bent down and grabbed the
starting blocks .


Then there was a beep . The swimmers shot off .
Kim’s start was perfect . She did her kick . Then she
popped up and started swimming . Her arms went so
fast . She seemed to be coasting .


Kim was the fastest swimmer for a hundred yards .



40


were trailing her . They seemed to be bouncing and
sloshing in Kim’s waves .


I was starting to think it would not be such a close
race after all . But just as I was thinking this, Grover
Castro said, “Wait for it!”


“Wait for what?” I said .


“You’ll see!” said Grover .



41


I looked back at the pool . Kim was still winning .
But Val was closing in on her . The gap was five feet .
Then it was three .


The swimmers flipped one last time . Kim was
starting to look a bit tired . The gap was down to two
feet . Then it was one foot . Then the two sisters were
swimming side by side . As they came to the finish line
it was too close to pick a winner . Kim and Val smacked
the side of the pool at what looked to be the same
moment .


A hundred parents in the stands looked up at the
clock . A hundred swimmers on the deck looked up as
well .


This is what the clock said:


Val Castro Lane 2 1:45


Kim Castro Lane 3 1:46


Val was the winner! 



42


43


I was standing on the sidelines while the Clark Bees
got set to play their last soccer game of the year . The
Clark team had racked up sixteen wins without a loss .
They had just one game left to play . They were getting
set to play the Dickens Chargers .



44


twins’ dad, Ted Pinker . He was holding the Pinkers’
dog, Princess, on a leash .


“Which one is Les?” I asked .


“That one,” said Ted Pinker, pointing .



45


Les came to the sidelines to visit with us . We shook
hands . I asked her, “Let’s say you could offer just one
tip to kids who would like to be better at soccer . What
would you tell them?”


Les said, “I think I would tell them to get good at
passing . If a team can’t pass well, it will never get good
shots on goal . You have to get so good at passing that
you do not have to think what your feet are doing .
Your feet just sort of think for themselves .”



46


Les petted Princess and ran off . I went to chat with
her twin sister, Pat . Pat is the goalkeeper for the team .
It’s her job to stop shots and keep players from scoring
on the Clark goal .


When we spotted her, Pat was slipping on mitts .
She explained, “Without these mitts, my hands would
get red . I would get blisters . Plus, the mitts help me get
a grip on the ball .


“What’s the best tip for stopping a shot?” I asked .


“Well,” Pat said, “You need to have soft hands .”


“Soft hands?” I said . “You mean you have to use a
lot of hand cream?”


Pat grinned . “No, what I mean is that your hands need
to bend back when the ball hits them . They need to bend
so they can take the shock . If they don’t bend, the ball will
bounce off your hands and then you will have to get set to
stop the next shot . It’s better to catch the ball if you can, or
knock it out of bounds .”


Just then a buzzer went off . It was time for the big
game . 



47


got her to sit on the sidelines .



48


and grabbed one with her mitts .



49


Both teams had shots on goal, but for a long time
there was no scoring . The clock ticked down . It started
to look like the game would end in a 0-0 tie . Then Les
got the ball . She passed to a teammate . The teammate
ran a bit and then passed the ball back to Les . Les
took a shot . The ball went zipping past the Dickens
goalkeeper and into the net!


Goal! The Clark Bees ran and jumped on top of Les .
Clark was in the lead, but there was still time left in the
game .


The Dickens players got the ball back . They ran and
passed the ball . A Dickens player took a shot, but Pat
grabbed it . Just then the horn went off . The game was
over!


The Clark Bees were the winners . They were the state
soccer champs! 

### **Jump!**

Drive down Tenth Street in the summer and you
will see them—the jumpers . You will see kids jumping
rope on playgrounds and street corners .


Jumping rope is something lots of kids like to do .
But most kids are not as good at it as the Jumping
Stars .


The last time I met with the Jumping Stars was in
August . They were jumping at the playground where
they hang out . Two of them were spinning the rope .
Two of them were jumping over the rope as it spun
past . The rope was spinning so fast it was hard to see it .
The jumpers’ feet went pit-pat-pit-pat-pit-pat on the
blacktop .


This sport is named jumping rope . But that makes
it sound much less cool than it is . The kids don’t just
jump . They dance . They twist and spin . They hop and
skip . They flip . They land on their hands and then pop
back up on their feet . They do all of this while jumping
over a rope at top speed . It is an art form, like dancing .



52


53


There are four jumpers on the Jumping Stars, Kit
Winter, Jo Palmer, Kate Agee, and Jaylin Smith . Kit
and Jo are the top jumpers .


Kit is sixteen . She is an awesome jumper . She has
been jumping rope since she was five . She is also one
of the most cheerful kids I know . Kit has a great smile .
She is always quiet . She always keeps her cool . I have
never seen her get mad .


Jo is something else . She jumps like a goddess, and
sometimes she acts like one, too . She plans the tricks
they do . She says who goes where . She is the boss .



54


called the flip . When the Stars do the flip, Jo starts out
jumping next to Kit . Then she draws near to Kit . Then
she flips over Kit’s back and lands on the far side . Both
of them keep jumping all the while . It’s a cool trick .


I looked on as the kids did the flip six times . Three
times they nailed it . Three times they missed it .


You could see Jo was upset when she and Kit
muffed the trick . Jo would moan and groan . She would
cross her arms and sulk . Jo would set her hands on her
hips like a mom who is mad at her kids . But Jo was
mad at herself, so she went and sat on the lawn .



55


“Think you can win it?” I asked .


“I hope so,” said Kit . “Last time we were seventh .”


“Nice job!” I said .


“Seventh is not good!” Jo said . Kit and the rest of the
Jumping Stars nodded . But they did not seem to feel
the pain of seventh place quite as much as Jo .



56


that one in the meet?”


“I hope so,” said Jo . “We need to get good at it . We
need to get to the point where we nail it nine times out
of ten .”


Then Jo said to her teammates, “Let’s do it! We are
going to keep practicing from dawn until dusk, until
we can do the flip in our sleep!” 



57


I could not make it to the jump rope contest . I had
to go to a wedding . But I told Jo and Kit I would speak
to them after it was over to see how the Jumping Stars
did .


But that is not what happened . They rang me .


“Mark?” Kit said . “Hey, it’s Kit Winter .”


“Hey, Kit! How did it go?”


“Well, not quite as well as we had hoped,” said Kit .
“We made it to the last round, but when we did the
flip, we sort of muffed it when my foot got caught in
the rope .”



58


get?”


“Fifth .”


“Fifth? Fifth is good, Kit! That’s two spots better
than last time!”


“Well,” Kit said, “don’t tell Jo that fifth place is cool .
She’s here, and she wants to tell you something .”


Jo got on the line .


“Fifth is no good!” she said . “We need to keep
practicing . We need to do better tricks . I need to land
the flip!”



59


She always wants to be better .


Jo went on . “It’s a bummer . But I felt like we had to
tell you that we can’t be in _Kids Excel_ after all .”


“Why not?”


“Fifth place is not bad—but not bad is not the same
as excelling,” said Jo .


“I think fifth place is good . I think you told me
there were a hundred jumping squads in the contest .”



60


I had to smile .


“Hey, Jo,” I said, “you are not the boss of me! _Kids_
_Excel_ is my mag . I get to say who gets to be in it . I
happen to think that you and Kit and the rest of the
Jumping Stars _do_ excel .”


“Please don’t run a profile of us yet!” Jo said . “ _Wait_
_until we excel!”_



61


“I’ll think it over,” I said .


Jo hung up .


I did think things over . I think that Jo and Kit and
the Jumping Stars are cool . I don’t care that they came
in fifth place . Jo is awesome, and they all train so hard,
that I bet they will not be in fifth place the next time
they enter a contest .


So here they are—the Jumping Stars!


(Jo Palmer, if you are looking at this, don’t be upset
at me . I can tell when kids excel . It’s my job!) 



62


63


jumps out . Or rather, it is driven out by the force of
Jethro landing . You see, Jethro is a splash artist _._


“For a long time my nickname was The Splash
King,” Jethro explained as I sat with him and his dad
on the deck in their backyard .


“But then I switched it to The Splash Artist,” said
his dad .


“Why the switch?” I asked .



64


“Wait a minute!” I said . “Are you saying that if you
and I pick a target, he can jump in the pool and make
the splash hit the target?”


“Yep—as long as it’s in his splashing reach .”


“I would like to see that!” I said .


“Will do!” said Jethro . “Which bed do you want me
to hit, Dad?”



65


peppers,” said his dad .


“No problem,” said Jethro . He went to the pool
house to get his swim trunks .


While Jethro was getting his swim trunks, his dad
and I looked at the yard . He pointed out some shrubs,
a wooden trellis, and a set of garden beds he had
planted on one side of the pool . The garden beds were
filled with lots of lettuce, peppers, and eggplants .



66


Jethro’s dad pointed out that the green peppers in
one of the beds looked a bit wilted . “It was hot the past
two days,” he said . “The peppers could use a splash .”


Jethro came out of the pool house with his trunks
on .


“We had better step back a bit,” said Jethro’s dad,
“unless you are in the mood to get wet .”


We took five big steps back .



67


floating on pool rafts . One of them was sipping a
drink . They did not see Jethro . Jethro snuck up on
them . He bounced once . He bounced twice . That was
when his sisters spotted him . They shouted and went to
the end of the pool . But they were not Jethro’s target .



68


pool . A great wave rose out of the pool and arched into
the air . It rose up and came crashing down, like a cat
pouncing on a mouse . His sisters winced, thinking the
wave would land on them . But it did not hit them . It
landed, just as Jethro had said it would, on the garden
bed with the green peppers .



69


“Nice one!” said Jethro’s dad . “That should keep
those peppers moist!” 



70


71


splashes that he could do .


He tucked his legs up into his chest and smacked
into the pool, sending a splash cascading onto the
shrubs . Then he did a “can opener” and sent a big
splash onto his sisters . It was a hot day, so they were
not too upset .


72


“So how did you get into splashing?” I asked .


“I have been splashing since I was five or six . You
see, Dad and I like to swim . In the summer we are out
here by the pool all weekend,” said Jethro . “We swim
and splash from dawn to dusk . When I was six or seven
we started to have splash contests .”



73


land in the pool . If you bend at the moment you hit,
that helps a lot . If you hit the pool sort of slanted, you
can make a big, big splash . And, best of all, you can
target the splash . What matters the most is how your
back is facing when you hit . You can bend it and tilt it
all sorts of different ways . Once you get the hang of it,
you can make the splash shoot off to one side and start
aiming at targets, like garden beds, or sisters . Sisters
are harder to hit since they can run and swim . Also,
sometimes they splash you back .”



74


splashing?” I asked .


“It took a long time . I’d say five summers . I made
hundreds and hundreds of splashes . Lots of them were
lame .”


This is something almost all of the kids I meet tell
me . Whether they excel at making splashes or spelling
words, they all say it takes time to get good . If you
want to be good at something, you have to keep at it .
If you want to be one of the best, you have to keep at it
day in and day out .



75


“Yep . The Splashman Contest was last week . Dad
and I went down for it . On my last splash I landed a
nice one . I soaked the deck . All the fans were dripping
wet . At the Splashman Contest that’s a _good_ thing . The
fans there _want_ to get wet . They think you are awesome
if you soak them to the skin . It’s not like when you get
your sisters wet and they run off to whine to Mom .
_Boo, hoo!_ ”


“It was a great splash,” said his dad . “One of the
best I’ve ever seen!”



76


“A hundred bucks,” said Jethro .


“What are you going to spend it on?”


“Um,” Jethro said, “Mom says we have to use it to
fill the pool .”


Jethro’s dad nodded .


“Man, you should see our pool bill!” he said . “We
have to fill the pool each day to make up for what Jethro
splashes out . A splash here, a splash there . After a while,
it starts to add up .”


77


It was getting late . I had jotted down all the facts . It
was time for me to go . I shook hands with The Splash
Artist . Then I went back to my car .


As I drove off, I saw Jethro do one last splash . He
sent a huge splash shooting onto one of the garden
beds . I think it was the one with the eggplants . 

79


test as part of a math contest .


I grabbed a test booklet and a pencil . I sat down .



80


This is what I saw in the test booklet:


_Problem 1. Three runners are running a ten-mile race._
_Runner 1 runs a mile in six minutes. Runner 2 runs_
_a mile in seven minutes. Runner 3 runs a mile in ten_
_minutes. After five miles, Runner 1 and Runner 2 sit_
_down to have lunch. Runner 1 spends fifteen minutes_
_eating her lunch. Runner 2 spends ten minutes eating her_
_lunch. Runner 3 keeps running. Who wins the race?_


A lot of time has passed since I took a math class . I
had to sit and think . It took me ten minutes, but in the
end I did get Problem 1 . (Runner 1 wins .)


After I did Problem 1, I was feeling proud of myself .
Then I looked at the kids sitting next to me . They had
finished lots of problems in the time it had taken me to
do one . One of them was on Problem 10 . One was on
Problem 15 .



81


subtract . You had to divide . You had to take the square
root of a number . I kept at it for ten minutes . But I
got mixed up . At last I wrote so much that my pencil
broke! The problem was just too much for me .


I closed the test booklet and handed it back to Dr .
Maud Chang .


“What did you think?” she asked .



82


“I think I didn’t do so well,” I said . “I did Problem
1, but Problem 2 was too hard for me .”


By this point I was not feeling proud of myself . But
Dr . Chang was sweet . She smiled and patted me on
the back . Then she said, “You should be proud you got
one . This is a hard test .”


Dr . Chang and I sat down to chat .



83


“The kids taking the test are sixteen or seventeen,”
she explained . “There are 60 of them . There are 100
problems on the test .”


“Are all of the problems as hard as the two I did?”


Dr . Chang smiled . “Well, yes . The problems get
harder and harder as you go on .”


“I see!”


So, if Problem 1 and Problem 2 were that hard,
then just think of what the rest must be like!


“How much time do the kids get?” I asked .


“180 minutes .”


“And who will grade the tests?”


“I will,” said Dr . Chang . “We should have the
winner’s name by the end of next week .”


“Good,” I said . “Let me know who wins .” 



84


85


winner!” she texted . “The winner of the math contest is
Denzel Brucker!”


I met Denzel not long after . We met in his math
classroom .


Denzel is sixteen . He is French . His mom came
with him to the United States when he was twelve .



86


“Well,” I said, “my math is not so good . I could not
get past Problem 2 on that test .”


“Problem 2?” said Denzel . “That was this one, I
think .”


Denzel wrote out the problem .


“Yes,” I moaned, “I tried that problem and I lost .”



87


I watched as Denzel started jotting down numbers
and letters . He got the problem in less than a minute .


“See?” he said . “It is not so hard!”


“Denzel,” I said, “Dr . Chang tells me you aced that
test . She says you missed just six problems out of a
hundred . That is fantastic! Tell me . How did you get so
good at math?”



88


Denzel sat down and told me the tale of his life . He
spoke good English but with an accent .


“When I was a kid in Saint Martin, math was the
subject I liked best . When I was seven I found that
doing math problems was a lot of fun . So I would get
math books and do the problems in them, just for fun .”


I jotted down notes .



89


“In life there are some problems you can take care
of,” Denzel explained . “Then there are some problems
you can’t . But math problems are not like that . If you
think hard and stick with it, you can get the math
problems .”


“Well,” I said . _“_ Maybe _you_ can! But not all of us
can, as I found out last week .”


Denzel went on, “I never made a plan to get good
at math . I just did problems for fun . I did a lot of
problems . And after a while I got good at it .”



90


for you?”


“I used to think the word problems would be hard,
but they were not so bad . I had to translate the words
from English into French . But the numbers are the
same in English as in French . They look the same on
the page, and they stand for the same things . So there
is no need to translate . That is part of why I like math
so much . It is the same in all places . 3 + 3 = 6 in Saint
Martin . It is the same here in the United States . It is
the same on the moon, or on Mars!” 



91


I asked him, “Has winning the state math contest
made your life different?”


“Overall, my life is the same,” said Denzel . “I was
in the paper . Then that stopped . The main thing that is
different is that I have been getting a lot of mail .”


“What sort of mail? Fan mail?”



92


colleges where math is taught . I got a letter from a
college in the United States . The name of the college is
Yale . Is Yale a good place to take math classes?”


“I’m not an expert on math, but I’ll bet it is,” I said .


“Yes? Yale is good? OK, I will . . . what is it you say
in English? _I will make a note of that_ . But you see, there
is a problem .”



93


“What’s the problem?” I asked .


“Too much mail! You see, it is not just Yale . I am
getting lots of letters . Yesterday I got a letter from a
college named Penn State . Last week I got letters from
Wisconsin and Cornell . So this is the problem: lots of
colleges . They all write to say: ‘Pick us! Take a math
class with us!’ Which one should I pick?”


“Denzel,” I said, “this is what we call _a good problem_
_to have_ . If you think hard and stick with it, I just bet
you will get this problem, too!” 



94


95


“For starters,” he said, “you have to pick a good
rock . You want one that is smooth and flat .”


Moe bent down and scooped up some rocks . He
held them in his hands for me to see .



96


“Here are some rocks that are just begging to be
skipped! See how nice and flat they are?”


Moe picked one of the rocks . It was small, thin,
smooth, and gray . It was two inches from end to end .
He held it in his hand so I could see it .



97


“You want to hold it in your hand, with the flat side
down . Wrap the side of the rock with your index finger,
like this . Then sling it . It’s best to toss sidearm . You
don’t want to aim it down at the lake too much . You
want the rock to be whizzing just inches from the top
of the lake . And, as you let go of the rock, you want to
snap your wrist so the rock starts spinning .”



98


99


I looked on as Moe tossed the rock . It went
skittering on the lake . _Pitter-pat_, _pitter-pat_, _pitter-pat_,
_pitter-pat_ . It must have skipped ten or twelve times .


“You want to skip one?” Moe asked .


It did not look hard when Moe did it . So I bent
down and picked up a rock . I wrapped the rock in my
finger . Then I flung it sidearm at the lake .


The rock struck the lake and sank . I can’t say it sank
like a rock since it _was_ a rock . The point is, _it did not_
_skip._


“When the rock sinks like that, we say it’s a _plonk_,”
said Moe . “That’s not what we want to see .”


I picked up a rock and tossed it .


Plonk!


“Snap your wrist!” Moe called .


I snapped my wrist as well as I could .


Plonk!



100


101


“You are so close,” said Moe . “Let me help you .” He
came up to my side and pointed out how to toss the
rock .


I tossed the rock . This time it was different . The
rock hit the top of the lake and went pitter-pat . It was
just three skips, but it felt awesome .


“Rock solid!” shouted Moe .


I soon found out that Moe, as a rock-skipper, likes
to use the word _rock_ . He sticks it in whenever he gets a
chance .


I skipped a bunch of rocks . I got one to skip five
times .


Moe yelled, “You rock!”


The next rock I tossed skipped six times .


“It’s like magic!” I said . “It’s cool! I’m hooked!” 



102


103


lesson on rock skipping as a sport .


“What matters?” I asked . “Is it how far the rock
skips or the number of times it skips?”


“Well,” said Moe, “here in the United States what
matters is the number of times the rock skips . But in
the United Kingdom it’s not like that . Over there what
matters is how far the rock goes . Also, over there in the
United Kingdom it is not named rock skipping .”



104


“Stone skiffing .”


“Skiffing? I like the sound of that!”


When Moe saw that I liked the word _skiffing_,
he reeled off a list of names for skipping rocks . “In
Denmark it is named _smutting_ . In Spain it’s _making_
_whitecaps_ . In Poland it’s _letting the ducks out.”_


“Letting the ducks out? Are you kidding?”


“No joke . That’s what they say .”



105


“Why do they say that?”


Moe shrugged, “I’m not sure .”


“Let’s focus on the number of skips,” I said . “What’s
a good number?”


“15 is not bad . 20 is good . 30 is awesome . The
record number of skips ever is 51 .”


“51? And I was so proud of my six skips!”


“Well,” Moe said, “you are just starting out .”


“I think you said you went to a stone skiffing
contest in the United Kingdom . How did it go? Did
you skiff your way to a prize?” I asked .


“I had one great skiff,” said Moe . “It landed me in
fifth place .”


“Out of?”


“Out of a hundred or so skiffers .”



106


107


“That’s so cool!” I said, patting him on the back .
“Bravo! That’s the way to let the ducks out!”


Moe smiled . “Want to see a snapshot?” he asked .


I nodded .


Moe got out a snapshot of him with his prize .


“My goal for the next trip over there is to be in the
top three,” he said .


“Rock on!” I said . 

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with this program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully leveled
in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.

The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many spellings
can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to make early
reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of the available
spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out as part of their
phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been deliberately
introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if they are
assigned at the proper time.

As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.
