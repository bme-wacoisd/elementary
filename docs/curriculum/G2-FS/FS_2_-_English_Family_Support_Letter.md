# **Welcome!**
## **Grade 2, Unit 2** **Foundational Skills**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will learn about long vowels, long vowel spelling alternatives, reading Tricky Words, and writing a

fictional narrative.


**What** **will** **my** **student** **learn?**

Students will learn the following long vowel sounds in this unit: /ae/ spelled ‘a_e’, as in _cake_ ; /ie/ spelled ‘i_e’, as in _bite_ ;

/oe/ spelled ‘o_e’, as in _home_ ; and /ue/ spelled ‘u_e’, as in _cute_ . Each of these long vowel spellings adds an ‘e’ to the end

of the word to make it a long vowel sound. Students will also learn the following spelling alternatives: /ee/ spelled ‘ee’

( _bee_ ) and ‘ea’ ( _beach_ ). Students will work on each long vowel sound pattern for several days.


Students will practice reading different decodable stories throughout this unit, such as “Mike’s Bedtime,” “The Milk,”

“The Jumping Frog,” “The Frog Race,” “The Hare and the Hedgehog,” “How the Hedgehog Tricked the Hare,” “The

Pancake,” and “The Panther.” Students will be expected to answer text-dependent questions about stories in complete

sentences orally and in written form. Students will also learn and recognize Tricky Words in these decodable stories.

Tricky Words are difficult to read and spell because they do not follow the letter-sound correspondences your student

has been taught. Students will also be planning, writing, and editing a fictional narrative in this unit.


**Additional** **Practice**

Students can practice these words each night by doing the following activities:


1. **Daily** **Use:** Encourage your student to use Tricky Words in everyday conversations. Prompt them to incorporate

Tricky Words into discussions about their day, activities, or observations.

2. **Sentence** **Creation:** Have your student use Tricky Words in sentences. Encourage them to create sentences

that demonstrate the meaning of each word and explain its context.

Students can practice these words each night by doing the following activities:


1. **Word** **Challenges:** Challenge your student to find words with the unit’s focus spelling patterns in books, in

magazines, or around the house. When they identify a word, discuss its spelling and meaning.

2. **Family** **Spelling** **Bee:** Join your student in a friendly contest to spell words with this unit’s focus spelling

patterns.
