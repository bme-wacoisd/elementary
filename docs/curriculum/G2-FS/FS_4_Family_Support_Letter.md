# **Welcome!**
## **Grade 2, Unit 4** **Foundational Skills**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will learn more spelling alternatives for vowel sounds and three tricky spellings.


**What** **will** **my** **student** **learn?**


Students will learn the following vowel sounds in this unit: /er/ spelled ‘er’ ( _her_ ), ‘ur’ ( _hurt_ ), and ‘ir’ ( _bird_ ); /i/ spelled ‘y’

( _myth_ ); /ie/ spelled ‘y’ ( _try_ ) and ‘igh’ ( _night_ ); /oe/ spelled ‘ow’ ( _snow_ ); /ee/ spelled ‘e’ ( _me_ ), ‘y’ ( _funny_ ), and ‘ey’ ( _key_ ); and /aw/

spelled ‘al’ ( _wall_ ). The following tricky spellings are taught in this unit: ‘e’ can be pronounced /e/ ( _pet_ ) or /ee/ ( _me_ ); ‘i’ can

be pronounced /i/ ( _it_ ) or /ie/ ( _biting_ ); and ‘y’ can be pronounced /ee/ ( _funny_ ), /i/ ( _myth_ ), /ie/ ( _try_ ), or /y/ ( _yes_ ). Students will

also read the decodable Reader _The_ _Job_ _Hunt_, which describes a nineteen-year-old girl’s search for a job in New York

City with the help of her younger brother. Students will practice writing a friendly letter and will edit for capitalization,

punctuation, commas in a series and in dates, pronoun cases, and prepositions.
