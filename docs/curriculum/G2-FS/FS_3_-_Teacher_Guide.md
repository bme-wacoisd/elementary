**Grade 2 Foundational Skills 3|**
Introduction


~~**UNIT 3 OVERVIEW**~~


This unit is devoted to introducing spelling alternatives for vowel sounds. Vowel sounds and their
spellings are the most challenging part of the English writing system. There are only two vowel
sounds that are almost always spelled one way. One is /a/, which is almost always spelled ‘a’ as in
_at_ . The other is /ar/, which is almost always spelled ‘ar’ as in _car_ . The other sixteen vowel sounds
have at least one significant spelling alternative. Several of them have many spelling alternatives.


**Vowel Spellings and Sounds**


The sounds and spellings taught in this unit are:


  - /ae/ spelled ‘a_e’ ( _cake_ ), ‘a’ ( _paper_ ), ‘ai’ ( _wait_ ), ‘ay’ ( _day_ )


  - /oe/ spelled ‘o_e’ ( _home_ ), ‘o’ ( _open_ ), ‘oa’ ( _boat_ ), ‘oe’ ( _toe_ )


  - /ie/ spelled ‘i_e’ ( _bite_ ), ‘i’ ( _biting_ ), ‘ie’ ( _tie_ )


  - /ue/ spelled ‘ue’ ( _cue_ ), ‘u_e’ ( _cute_ ), ‘u’ ( _unit_ )


  - /aw/ spelled ‘aw’ ( _paw_ ), ‘au’ ( _Paul_ ), ‘augh’ ( _caught_ )


Each sound is given a multiday treatment. On the first day you will do a board sort to preview the
spellings for the sound. You will also set up a Spelling Tree—a graphic organizer that allows you
to sort words by spelling—adding new words over a period of several lessons. You will update this
Spelling Tree as students are formally introduced to the spelling alternatives for the sound and
perform a series of word sorts.


**Tricky Spellings**


Some of the spellings introduced in this unit are “shared” between two sounds. For example, the
spelling ‘o’ is introduced as a spelling alternative for the /oe/ sound, as in _open_ . However, students
should already know that ‘o’ is the basic code spelling for the /o/ sound as in _hot_ . We can say this
spelling is shared between /o/ and /oe/. Or, we can say it is ambiguous because it can stand for
either /o/ or /oe/. Because this spelling can stand for more than one sound, it is called a tricky
spelling. Tricky spellings pose a problem for the reader. When a reader comes across an unfamiliar
word containing the ‘o’ spelling, he or she may need to try pronouncing the tricky spelling in
different ways to determine the actual pronunciation of the word.


The following tricky spellings are taught in this unit:


  - ‘o’ can be pronounced /o/ ( _hop_ ) or /oe/ ( _open_ )


  - ‘a’ can be pronounced /a/ ( _hat_ ) or /ae/ ( _paper_ )


Introduction
**1**


**2**




 - ‘i’ can be pronounced /i/ ( _it_ ) or /ie/ ( _biting_ )


 - ‘u’ can be pronounced /u/ ( _but_ ) or /ue/ ( _unit_ )


**Tricky Words**


A set of Tricky Words is reviewed in Lesson 1. From this point on, Tricky Words are introduced on an
as-needed basis.


The following Tricky Word is introduced in the Reader and should be pretaught before the story is
assigned:


 - Pausing Point: “The Math Contest”: _minute_


When introducing this word, be sure to draw attention to the parts read (and spelled) just as students
would expect based on what they have learned so far. Also, identify the tricky parts of the word.


As you introduce new spelling patterns, you will notice some words previously introduced as Tricky
Words include the newly taught spelling patterns and no longer need to be classified as Tricky
Words. For example, once you have taught ‘o’ as a spelling alternative for /oe/, the words _no_ and _so_
no longer need to be treated as Tricky Words. They can be described as members of a larger spelling
pattern including words like _go_ and _most_ . As spelling patterns are introduced, the corresponding
words should be removed from the Tricky Word Wall.


**Decodable Reader: Kids Excel**


The Reader for this unit is _Kids Excel_ . This fictional Reader consists of profiles of kids who excel at
various activities—spelling, swimming, playing soccer, jumping rope, splashing, math, rock skipping.
Each profile progresses across several selections.


**Reading**


At the Grade 2 reading level, the focus is on text-dependent questions and careful reading. Once
again in this unit, direction is included for teachers to utilize a purposeful re-reading approach with
several stories from the Reader. These lessons are carefully crafted to focus students on the text
itself and precisely what meanings can be derived from careful examination of said text.


Additionally, you will note that wherever these lessons occur (Lessons 4, 8, 11, 19, and 20 of this
unit), the commitment to placement of decodable text in the Reader and Activity Book does not
waiver. Purposeful re-reading lessons will intensify as the units progress. You will find the reading
lessons occurring about once a week. Please note: For some weeks where writing or assessment are
the focus, there may not be sufficient time available to conduct a purposeful re-reading lesson.


**Grammar**


The grammar lessons for Unit 3 have students continuing to focus on capitalization, quotation
marks, and ending punctuation. In addition, Unit 3 focuses on common and proper nouns, antonyms
and synonyms, and verbs.


Foundational Skills 3


  - Throughout the unit, students may also practice decoding and spelling abbreviations used in titles,
addresses, and dates.


  - Tell students that using the word _mister_ or _missus_ before a person’s name is usually a way of showing
respect. Explain that when we abbreviate these words to go before a person’s name, we write it Mr.
and Mrs. Write these on the board and have students say _mister_ and _missus_ with you.


  - Explain that Mrs. is used before the name of a married woman, and Ms. (an abbreviation for miss) is
used before the name of a girl or an unmarried woman. Tell students that Ms. can also be used if they
aren’t sure whether a woman is married or not.


  - On their own paper, have students write the title and name of an adult they respect. Give an example
to support students as needed.


  - Explain that we also use abbreviations for parts of addresses, such as street, place, boulevard, drive,
and so on. Write the abbreviation for each on the board.


  - Have students write their address using the abbreviated forms you provided. Remind students that
we capitalize the first letter of these abbreviations when they are part of a proper noun (e.g., Park
Ave.).


  - Finally, explain that abbreviations can also be used for months of the year and days of the week. Write
Monday, Mon., January, and Jan. on the board.


  - Have students write today’s date, including the day of the week, on their own paper (e.g., Fri., Nov. 15,
2024). ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iv; TEKS 2.2.C.iii**~~


**Spelling**


Weekly spelling lists and assessments continue in this unit. The spelling lists continue to be made
up of words with previously taught letter-sound correspondences.


During writing activities, students will have an opportunity to practice correctly spelling highfrequency words and multisyllabic words with sound-spellings they have learned. Refer to the
scope and sequence as needed to determine if the sound-spelling has been previously taught, and
focus on those words when reviewing their writing. Many writing assignments also use an editing
checklist, so students should be checking their spelling before submitting their assignment.


Students will also create a Dictation Journal that focuses on spelling words in isolation as well as in
sentences. Spelling assessments will also incorporate a phrase or sentence that students must spell
correctly.


  - For the Dictation Journal, you can either have students use a journal they use for other writing
activities or you may wish to create a small dictation journal for each student. Stapling five pieces of
paper together is all you will need for each journal. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii; TEKS 2.2.C.i; TEKS 2.2.C.iv**~~


**TEKS 2.2.B** . Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (iv) decoding compound words, contractions, and common abbreviations; (iii) decoding multisyllabic
words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams,including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables; **TEKS**
**2.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (iii) spelling compound words, contractions, and common abbreviations; (i) spelling one-syllable words with
closed syllables; open syllables: VCe syllables: vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables, and final stable syllables; (iv) spelling multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns..


Introduction
**3**


**4**



**Writing**


In Unit 3, students will practice writing their own personal narrative. Mr. Mowse makes another
appearance in this unit to help students practice editing.


At this point, students have learned one way to write every sound in English except for the very rare /
zh/ as in _treasure_ . (They should also know a number of spelling alternatives for consonant sounds.)
They should therefore be able to write a plausible, if not dictionary-correct, spelling for any word in
their oral vocabulary. As the year goes on they will learn more and more of the spelling alternatives
they will need to achieve dictionary-correct spelling. However, it will take some time for most students
to begin to spell with a high level of accuracy, particularly when it comes to spelling vowel sounds.


Spelling achievement will generally trail reading achievement. Students must first be introduced to the
spelling alternatives and learn to decode them while reading. Then, after a certain amount of exposure to
the spellings in written words, students will begin to select the correct spelling in their own writing. Some
students move fairly rapidly from seeing spelling alternatives in print and completing word sorts to using
the correct spellings in their writing. Others take much longer to master conventional spelling. It is not
unusual for this to take several years and it is not surprising given the complicated nature of the sound/
spelling correspondence system of the English language. Nevertheless, the orderly, systematic way in
which the spelling code is taught in this program should lead to noticeable improvements in spelling ability.


Remember to collect student writing for their portfolios. Most students enjoy looking back at their
writing from time to time throughout the year to see how much they have grown as writers.


**Left-Handed Cursive Guidance**


Left-handed writers need to grip the writing instrument far enough back from the point to see what
is being written and not smear what has just been written. Have students grip the pencil around
1-1.5 inches from the point.


Have students tilt their paper so their arm is at a right angle to the bottom edge. This will allow the
wrist to sit at a natural arc while writing.


Have students write with their hands below the writing line and the wrist straight.


Immediately correct students who use a “hooked’ style of writing, because this may cause strain to
the wrist.


Allow your left-handed students to hold their pen or pencil with a relaxed grip, as gripping too tightly
can cause hand fatigue and strain.


Encourage your left-handed students to slant their writing to the left rather than to the right. This
will help them write more smoothly and with less smudging.


Foundational Skills 3


Model cursive letter formation for your left-handed students, showing them how to form each letter
from the left to the right.


Provide your left-handed students with plenty of practice time as they develop their skills.


~~**UNIT 3 ASSESSMENT**~~


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


Throughout this unit, formative assessments are clearly marked for monitoring individual student
performance and progress in key skills. Quick “Checks for Understanding” to evaluate classroom
performance as a whole are also designated in various lessons.


An analysis of students’ performance on weekly spelling assessments may also be a valuable tool in
gaining insight into specific gaps in code knowledge for individual students. You are encouraged to
use the spelling analysis tool provided with each assessment to summarize data about the types of
errors students make.


You will also be prompted to listen to students read orally, making notes on the Anecdotal Reading
Record, as well as collect data on students’ responses to story discussion questions. In addition, you
will be prompted to collect specific activity pages to monitor progress on the spelling alternatives
and tricky spellings taught in this unit.


Careful attention to this information, collected on a daily basis, will enable teachers to quickly
determine which students may benefit from reteaching and/or more practice in particular skills,
using the Additional Support activities found at the end of each lesson.


**Student Performance Assessments**


You will be prompted to administer a midpoint Dictation Decoding Assessment in Lesson 15.
Students will be asked to look at several words on the designated activity page and then circle the
written word which matches the spoken word you say. The target words include the vowel sound/
spellings taught in this unit thus far; distractors have been intentionally selected because they
represent frequent sound/spelling confusions. Student performance on this assessment is a good
indicator of whether students have mastered the new sound/spellings taught thus far. A multipart
end-of-unit Student Performance Assessment occurs in Lesson 25, which includes another
Dictation Decoding Assessment. Students will also be asked to independently read a new story in
_Kids Excel_ silently and then answer written comprehension questions about the selection. Finally,
the Grammar Assessment evaluates students’ understanding of common and proper nouns, verbs,
and the correct formation of plurals.

~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice the Unit 3 skills can be found in
Pausing Point section included at the end of the last lesson. It is strongly recommended that you
pause for 3 days and provide targeted remediation for individual or groups of students in any areas
in which they performed poorly on the end-of-unit assessment.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the _Fluency Supplement_, is available in the program’s online materials. This
component has been designed to complement the unit. In it you will find a poem, an informational
piece titled “Did You Know?”, a Reader’s Theater, a realistic fiction selection, and a science or social
studies selection. See the directions in the _Fluency Supplement_ for further guidance.


~~**APPENDIX**~~


This unit again includes the resource Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words for your
reference.

Lesson 1 Spelling Alternatives: The /ae/ Sound and Its Spellings
**9**


**10**



~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Over the next several lessons, you will teach spelling alternatives for the
/ae/ sound. The spellings include the basic code spelling ‘a_e’ as in _cake_ and
the spelling alternatives ‘a’ as in _paper_, ‘ai’ as in _wait_, and ‘ay’ as in _day_ . The
chart shows you which of these spellings are most common for this sound.
Students should already know the basic code spelling ‘a_e’ as in _cake_ . Some
of them may also be familiar with the spellings ‘ay’, ‘ai’, and ‘a’.


Here are some patterns for your information:


 - The ‘ **a_e** ’ separated digraph spelling is never used for the final sound in a
word or syllable; there is always a consonant sound that follows /ae/, and the
spelling for that consonant sound is inserted between the ‘a’ and the ‘e’ ( _ape_,
_rate_, _make_ ).


 - Many ‘a_e’ words change to words spelled with only ‘a’ when a suffix is added
(e.g., _name_   - _naming_ and _bake_   - _baking)_ . The ‘e’ is dropped when a suffix
beginning with a vowel sound is added.


 - The ‘ **a** ’ spelling is actually more common than the basic code spelling ‘a_e’.
However, it was not chosen as the basic code spelling for two reasons: 1. ‘a’
is the basic code spelling for /a/ as in cat, and 2. ‘a’ > /ae/ is rare in onesyllable words of the sort used in beginning reading materials (strange,
waste); it is primarily found in multisyllable words (naming, paper, April).


 - ‘ **ai** ’ is generally used in the initial position of a syllable (aim, aid) or the
medial position of a syllable (pail, paint) and is almost always followed by a
consonant spelling. It is rarely used in the final position of a syllable.


 - ‘ **ay** ’ is generally used in the final position of a syllable ( _say_, _pay_ ); it is rarely
found in the initial position or the medial position of a syllable.


Foundational Skills 3


  - The spellings ‘ **ey** ’, ‘ **ea** ’, and ‘ **eigh** ’ are included in the Spellings for the Sound
/ae/ graph, but they are not taught in Unit 3.


**Foundational Skills**

  - Over the course of this unit, you will be asked to make and display nine
Spelling Trees. If wall space for display is limited, you may decide instead to
use a chart tablet to create all of your Spelling Trees during the year. Dedicate
the chart pad to Spelling Trees so you and students can use the pad as a
quick reference. Draw only one tree per page.


  - In this lesson you will be asked to create two Spelling Trees: one for the short
vowel /a/ sound and its spelling ‘a’ and one for the long vowel /ae/ sound
and its four spellings (‘a_e’, ‘a’, ‘ai’, and ‘ay’) introduced in this unit. You should
have the tree assembled and ready to be displayed before you begin the
exercise. For best results, try to make the tree at least 24” x 18”, preferably a
good deal larger.


  - Make each trunk of the Spelling Trees out of brown construction paper or
draw the trunk on white chart paper. Each tree for this lesson should have
five branches forking off from the central trunk. The branches vary in length
and correlate with the power bar on the Spelling Cards. For example, the ‘a’
spelling is the most common spelling for the long vowel /ae/ sound, so its
branch is the longest on the /ae/ Tree. The shortest branch on the tree is on
the top for odd ducks; see explanation below.


  - For the /ae/ Tree, use four branches for the more common spellings (‘a_e’, ‘a’,
‘ai’, and ‘ay’), and one branch at the top for odd ducks. Odd ducks are words
having the /ae/ sound spelled in a way not explicitly taught in this unit. The
/a/ Tree should have five branches of the same length, all for words with /a/.


  - Label five of the branches on the /a/ Tree ‘a’. The branches should all be the
same length.


  - Make multiple copies on green paper of the leaf template found in Teacher
Resources at the back of this volume. The leaves should be big enough to
write words on, small enough so you can fit at least twenty-five to thirty
words on the Spelling Tree, but not so small that the words are unreadable
when mounted on the wall. The leaves are for words that contain one of the
spelling patterns.


  - Write /ae/ words such as _same_, _lake_, _baking_, _paper_, _rain_, _wait_, _day_, _say_ on the
leaves. Also write these /a/ words on leaves: _back_, _sand_, _grass_, _grab_, _snap_,
_chat_, _raft_, and _mask_ .


Lesson 1 Spelling Alternatives: The /ae/ Sound and Its Spellings
**11**


- On yellow paper, make multiple copies of the odd duck template found
in Teacher Resources at the back of this volume. For /ae/, the odd ducks
include ‘eigh’ as in _eight_, ‘ey’ as in _hey_, ‘ea’ as in _great_, ‘ei’ as in _vein_, ‘e’ as in
_José_, ‘ae’ as in _sundae_, and ‘et’ as in _ballet_ . You do not need to write any words
in advance on the odd duck templates; just have these available during the
lesson should students offer any odd duck spellings for the long vowel /ae/
sound.

Foundational Skills


**Primary Focus**
Students will orally provide six to eight words containing the /a/ sound, and will
work as a class to produce words with the following sound/spellings: /ae/ > ‘a_e’,
‘a’, ‘ai’, and ‘ay’. ~~**TEKS 2.2.A.ii; TEKS 2.2.B.iii**~~


Students will sort words with the /a/ sound/spellings and words with /ae/ sound/
spellings on the class Spelling Trees. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii**~~


Students will read and review at least twenty previously taught Tricky Words.

~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii; TEKS 2.2.B.vii**~~


~~**BOARD SORT /AE/ › ‘A’, ‘AI’, AND ‘AY’ (5 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** As in Unit 2, Unit 3 focuses on vowel sounds. Students will learn many
new vowel sounds and spellings, but today they will first review the basic
code for the short vowel sound /a/.


  - Write ‘a’ on the board/chart paper, and ask students what sound they would
make if they saw this spelling. _(/a/ as in_ cat _)_


  - Ask students to share at least six to eight words containing the short vowel
/a/ sound. Write the words on the board/chart paper and circle the ‘a’ in each
word, reminding students the spelling ‘a’ represents the short vowel /a/ sound.


  - Tell students today they will focus on the long vowel sound /ae/, as in _bake_ .
Have students say the sound /ae/.


  - Remind students they have already learned one spelling for this sound, the
separated digraph ‘a_e’. Write ‘a_e’ on the board/chart paper, and ask students
what sound they would make if they saw this spelling. _(/ae/ as in_ cake _)_


  - Ask students to provide two or three words that have the ‘a_e’ spelling.
Record these words on the board/chart paper under the column ‘a_e’; use


**TEKS 2.2.A.ii** Demonstrate phonological awareness by distinguishing between long and short vowel sounds in one-syllable

final stable syllables; (vii) identifying and reading high-frequency words from a research-based list.


Foundational Skills 3


two-finger pointing, as you did in Unit 2, to highlight the spelling and also
circle it with a horseshoe loop.


  - Tell students there are other ways to write the /ae/ sound and over the next
few days, they are going to learn several additional spellings for the sound.


  - Write the following headers on the board/chart paper in columns, next to the
‘a_e’ column: ‘a’, ‘ai’, and ‘ay’.


  - Ask students to share any words containing the /ae/ sound (not the letter ‘a’
but the sound /ae/).


  - Sort the /ae/ words students provide according to spellings. Write each word
and circle the letters that stand for the /ae/ sound in the word. For example,
if a student says _plane_, list the word under the heading ‘a_e’ and circle the ‘a’
and ‘e’. If a student says _play_, list the word under the heading ‘ay’ and circle
the ‘ay’. If a student says _playdate_, list the word twice, once under the heading
for ‘ay’, with the ‘ay’ circled, and once under the heading for the ‘a_e’, with ‘a’
and ‘e’ circled.


  - Call students’ attention to the four spelling patterns for the long vowel
sound, /ae/.


  - This chart shows examples of words students may provide. Each column
represents the major spellings of the long vowel sound /ae/.


**Note:** If students provide a word that contains an /ae/ spelling not taught
in this unit (e.g., _eight_ or _weigh_ ), record the word in the column labeled ‘odd
ducks’ to acknowledge that the student correctly provided a word with the
/ ae/ sound, but with a spelling not yet taught. However, do not list words in
the odd ducks column unless students suggest these words.

|/ae/ > ‘a_e’|/ae/ > ‘a’|/ae/ > ‘ai’|/ae/ > ‘ay’|odd ducks|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|same|baking|rain|day|great|
|lake|paper|wait|say|hey|
|||||weigh|



  - Students will most likely suggest examples of most of the major spelling
patterns, but you should introduce any spellings listed that are not offered
spontaneously by students. You can do this by writing one of the sample
words on the board/chart paper, reading the word to students, and then
asking them which letters stand for the /ae/ sound in the word.


  - Leave the words on the board/chart paper, as you will add some of them to
the Spelling Tree in the next exercise.

~~**ELPS 1.D; ELPS 3.J**~~


**16**



~~**SPELLING TREES /AE/ AND /A/ (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Show students the Spelling Trees you prepared in advance, and explain that
you will use one tree to help them keep track of the spellings for the long
vowel /ae/ sound and the other to keep track of spellings for the short vowel
/a/ sound.


 - Explain to students the branches are like the power bar because they show
how common a spelling is for a sound; longer branches represent more
common spellings, and shorter branches represents less common spellings.


 - Point out that the odd ducks branch is the shortest. Explain that words with
unusual spellings are called odd ducks. Odd ducks are Tricky Words, and like
Tricky Words, odd ducks are on yellow paper (whereas words that can be
sounded out are on green paper).


 - Show students the leaves with words containing short vowel /a/ spellings
you prepared in advance. Ask students to read one word at a time. Then ask
a student to tell you which tree this leaf/word belongs to and attach it to the
tree. Continue until all of the /a/ leaves have been read and displayed on the
tree. Call students’ attention to the fact that the short vowel /a/ sound is
spelled only one way: every word with the /a/ sound is spelled with ‘a’, and all
of the branches of the /a/ Tree represent the exact same spelling.


 - Show students the leaves you prepared with the long vowel /ae/ sound. First
show and read words with ‘a_e’ spelling, emphasizing that this is the long
vowel /ae/ sound. Again ask students to tell you where the leaves belong and
attach them to the correct branch of the tree.


 - Continue by showing students the other leaves with long vowel /ae/ sounds
and different spellings. You should read the words aloud to students, because
these spellings have not been taught, emphasizing the long vowel /ae/ sound.


 - Ask a student to tell you where each leaf/word belongs and add it to the
correct branch of the /ae/ Spelling Tree. After all words have been read and
attached to the tree, point out that unlike the short vowel /a/ sound, the long
vowel /ae/ sound can be spelled in several different ways. Point out each
branch on the /ae/ tree and its specific spelling.


 - Choose one or two words from the board sort containing each spelling to
write on a leaf. Copy the word, read it aloud, and have a student attach it to
the correct branch. If students came up with any odd ducks during the board
sort, they can be copied onto the yellow duck-shaped cards.


 - Tell students you will be using the Spelling Tree as an organizer for the next
several lessons of work on the sound /ae/ and its spellings. Students will
have chances to add more words to the tree.

Observation: Spelling Alternatives


Ask as many students as possible to read a word and place the leaf on the Spelling

Tree. Make note of their individual ability to decode words with /ae/ and /a/ in the

Spelling Alternatives Observation Record.

**Digital Component 1.1**




  - Call students’ attention to the baseball diamond you prepared in advance.


  - Tell students that today you will play a baseball game to review Tricky Words
and words with previously taught sound/spellings. Remind students that
being able to quickly decode words can help them become fluent readers.


  - Divide the class into two teams, having one team at a time line up in front
of the board/chart paper. (You may prefer to have students stay seated and
divide the class into teams by the location that they are seated.) Each team
takes a “turn at bat” as follows:


    - Using the cards you prepared in advance, choose a card and ask the first
person on the team to read it aloud. If the word is read correctly, draw a
line from home plate to first base, signifying a “hit.” This player then goes
to the back of his or her team’s line, while the next player comes forward to
read the next card. If he or she reads the word correctly, draw a line from
first to second base. Play continues in this manner. If the fourth player
reads the word correctly, draw a line from third base to home plate and
mark “1 run” for the team. Play continues for this team so long as no words
are misread; when one word is misread, the next team takes its turn at bat.
You may want to keep a list of the batting order.


  - Set a timer for ten minutes, and tell students that whichever team has the
most runs when the timer rings wins. Point out that accuracy is important,
but so is speed when reading words quickly. The more players on their team
who have a turn to read words, the more likely their team is to score runs.

**Primary Focus:** Students will read “A Letter from the Publisher” with purpose and
understanding and will answer oral, literal, and inferential questions about key
details in the text. ~~**TEKS 2.1.A; TEKS 2.6.A**~~


~~**INTRODUCE THE READER AND THE STORY (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Distribute the Reader _Kids Excel_ . Discuss with students what it means to
excel. (Excel _means to work hard to do something very well._ )


  - Explain the title of the Reader, _Kids Excel_, is supposed to be the name of
a magazine. Each story in the Reader is written as if it were an article in
the magazine.


  - Discuss that many magazines are composed of nonfiction, or informational
articles, meaning the stories report real-life occurrences. The characters in
_Kids Excel_ are fictional (made-up), but the stories are realistic. This means
the genre for _Kids Excel_ is realistic fiction. You may show students examples
of magazines you brought in from home and/or school.


  - Tell students the first story is titled “A Letter from the Publisher.” Ask them
if they know what publishers do. _(They are the people in charge of printing_
_magazines and books.)_


  - Ask students to look at the table of contents and tell you the page on which
“A Letter from the Publisher” begins. _(page 2)_


  - Have students turn to the page. Point out this is set up like a letter, so there
is a beginning greeting (salutation), the body of the letter (the main points),
and the signature line (written name).

stands for one of the /ae/ spellings: ‘ai’, ‘ay’, and ‘a_e’.


- Tell students you want them to help you sort the words according to spellings
and write them in the proper columns.


- Point out the first word, _stain_, has already been sorted.


- Ask a student to read the second word in the box, _paid_, and ask the other
students which letters spell the /ae/ sound, telling them to circle this
spelling. Then ask where you should write the word.


- Add the word to the correct column. Have the class do the same on their
activity pages. Then use the word in an oral sentence to illustrate its meaning.


- Repeat this process until all of the words have been sorted.


- Ask students if the spelling ‘ai’ is used at the end of any words. ( _no_ ) Tell them
this spelling tends to be followed by a consonant spelling.


- Ask students if ‘ay’ is used at the end of any words in the sort. Tell them
this spelling (unlike ‘ai’) tends to be at the end of the word (or syllable, as in
_playing_ ). It does not tend to be at the beginning of the word or in the middle.
It is most commonly a word-ender.

  - Remind students the new Reader is about kids who excel at different things.
Ask students what it means to excel. _(It means to work hard and do something_
_very well.)_ As we read, we will be focusing on the main events and key details of
the story.


  - Tell students to open to the table of contents and find the story that comes after
“A Letter from the Publisher.” Ask students for the title. _(“The Spelling Bee”)_


  - Point out that this story and the three that follow it in the table of contents are
printed in the same color. Ask students to read the titles of the stories printed
in orange and note that they all appear to be about the same topic. This series
of stories is about a spelling bee.


  - Tell students that they will see several titles used in the Reader. Write the
abbreviations for these titles on the board ( _Mr. and Mrs._ ) and help students
decode them. Have students share how they could use abbreviations for
these titles instead of writing them out.


  - Refer to the KWL chart you prepared in advance. Tell students that strong
readers ask questions before they start reading in order to gain information

**Purpose for Reading**




  - Ask students to read the story to learn answers to the "W" questions in the
KWL chart. Have students read with a partner to describe the main events of
the story.


  - Tell students that when describing the main events, or important things
that happen in a story, it is best to tell these events in order and use words
such as _First_, _Then_, _Next_, and _Last_ . Remind students that the main events
are important plot points that impact the characters and help readers
understand the story completely.


  - Remind students to look at the Individual Code Chart or look to the Spelling
Trees for additional help sounding out words.


~~**READ “THE SPELLING BEE” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Independent Reading**

  - Explain to students that they will independently read the first page silently,
then partner up and one partner will read that page aloud. Ask students to
independently read the second page silently, then the other partner will read
that page aloud, and so on.


  - After students finish reading the chapter, have the partner pairs retell the
story in their own words to describe the main events. Encourage students to
use the signal words, _First_, _Then_, _Next_, and _Last_ .


  - Have students complete Activity Page 2.2. when they finish reading and
retelling the story. Encourage students to look back in the story for the

~~**TEKS 2.2.C.i; TEKS 2.2.C.iv**~~


~~**INTRODUCE /AE/ › ‘A’ AND TRICKY SPELLING ‘A’ (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students they recently learned two new spellings for the /ae/ sound:
‘ai’ and ‘ay’. Point to the ‘ai’ and ‘ay’ branches, and have students read some
of the words aloud. Also review ‘a_e’. Tell students they now know three
spellings for the long vowel sound /ae/.


  - Today students will focus on another spelling for the /ae/ sound, the spelling
‘a’. Point out the ‘a’ branch on the /ae/ Spelling Tree, noting the length of the
branch. Tell students the letter ‘a’ can sometimes be used to represent the
long vowel /ae/ sound and sometimes the short vowel /a/ sound. So the ‘a’
can be a tricky spelling.


  - The spellings can be found on the following pages in the Vowel Code Flip
Book and in students’ Individual Code Charts:

|Vowel Code Flip Book|Individual Code Chart|
|---|---|
|1.<br>/ae/ > ‘a’ (_paper_) **page 8**|1.<br>/ae/ > ‘a’ (_paper_) **page 8**|



  - Turn to **Vowel Code Flip Book page 8** and show students the ‘a’ Spelling
Card for /ae/, as well as the target word _paper_ on the card. Write the word
_paper_ on the board/chart paper and point to the ‘a’. Explain that when the
letter ‘a’ comes at the end of a syllable, it represents the /ae/ sound. This is

called an open syllable which is a syllable ending with a long vowel sound that
is spelled with a single vowel letter. Sound out the word with students using
the /ae/ sound. Put the Spelling Card on the appropriate space. Discuss the
power bar.


 - Distribute the green markers. Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart**
**page 8** . Guide students in outlining the appropriate card and spelling on
the chart.


 - Show students the leaves with the ‘a’ spelling for /ae/ one by one. Ask
students to read the word aloud. Use the words in an oral sentence. Ask a
student to tape the leaf to the Spelling Tree.


 - Call attention to the location of the ‘a’ in these words in which the ‘a’
represents the /ae/ sound. Point out the patterns: the words are twosyllable words, and the ‘a’ is at the end of the syllable (or stands alone in
the syllable).


 - Compare and contrast words where ‘a’ represents the /a/ sound with words
where ‘a’ represents the /ae/ sound. Write the words in the box below on the
board/chart paper to demonstrate the spelling pattern.


 - Point out ‘a’ represents the /a/ sound when a consonant follows the ‘a’.


**Note:** Sometimes a consonant also comes before the ‘a’.


 - Point out ‘a’ represents the /ae/ sound in many two-syllable words when the
‘a’ comes at the end of a syllable.


 - Explain this is why it is helpful to see a two-syllable word written with a space
between the syllables. When students see two-syllable words written in parts
where the ‘a’ comes at the end of a syllable, they will know the ‘a’ represents
the /ae/ sound.

1. ‘a_e’: mistake, cascade


2. ‘ai’: raisin, waitress


3. ‘ay’: crayon, daydream, driveway, daytime


4. ‘a’: bacon, basin, maker, crater, label, wafer


  - Ask students to read each word on the board.


  - After students read each word, summarize the information about the sound
and spelling.


  - Distribute the prepared leaves with the /ae/ sound to student pairs.


  - Tell students to read the word together and circle the spelling.


  - Ask each student pair to show the class their leaf, read the word aloud, and
say which /ae/ and/or /a/ spelling the word contains. Students can then
tape their leaf to the appropriate branch on the /ae/ Spelling Tree.


~~**TRICKY SPELLING ‘A’ (20 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.2.C.v**~~


  - Write the word _cabin_ on the board, but do not read the word aloud or ask
students to say the word at this time.


  - Write _ca|bin_ and _cab|in_ underneath _cabin_ . Explain that both of these are ways
students might try chunking the letters into syllables.


  - Tell students, “I am going to say a sentence using this word. I want you to
listen carefully and then decide how to read and say this word.”


  - Say, “My family and I are going camping in the woods this weekend, and we
are going to stay in a  .”


  - Point to the syllables of the first word and model how to sound out each
syllable as it is divided. _Ca|bin_ is pronounced /k/ /ae/ /b/ /i/ /n/, with the
(long vowel) /ae/ sound.


  - Now point to the syllables in the second word _cab_ | _in_ and model sounding out
the word as it is divided, /kab/ /in/ with the /a/ sound.


  - Ask students which pronunciation is a word that makes sense. ( _cab_ | _in_ )
Circle _cab_ | _in_ .


  - Review the spelling patterns of the long /ae/ versus the short /a/ sound
(i.e., ‘a’ is pronounced /ae/ at the end of the syllable and /a/ if there are
consonants on either side).


**TEKS 2.2.C.v** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by spelling words using knowledge of syllable division patterns,
including words with double consonants in the middle of the word.

  - Use the target word in an oral sentence, alternately pointing to and saying
the /ae/ and /a/ sound, depending on how the syllables are divided. Ask
students which word makes sense and then circle the correct word.


  - Remind students if the ‘a’ has a consonant on either side, it represents the
/a/ sound; if it comes at the end of a syllable, it represents the /ae/ sound.


  - Remember, do not write the sentences, just display the written words with
alternate syllable division.

 - Point out that the title of the story has a question mark. This means we are
not sure whether or not Gail was born to spell, meaning we do not know if she
has been a good speller all her life.


 - Remind students of what they have learned about reading and spelling
abbreviations for titles and parts of an address. Write “Davis Street” and
“Mister Lopez” on the board. These phrases come from the story. Next,
write the phrases with abbreviations, “Davis St.”, “Mr. Lopez”, and work with
students to decode the abbreviations.

**Purpose for Reading**

 - Tell students to read “Born to Spell?” to find out how Gail got started as a
speller.


**Partner Reading**

 - Read the first two lines of the story. Ask students, “Who is telling this story?”
( _Mark Deeds_ ) Explain that all of the stories in _Kids Excel_ are written by the
publisher, Mark Deeds. This means Mark is the narrator, the person who tells
the story. We get to read about Gail and her family from the narrator’s point
of view.


 - Ask students what type of punctuation marks are used to let the reader know
who is speaking. Remind students that when characters talk back and forth
to one another, this is called dialogue.


 - Have students read “Born to Spell?” in pairs.


~~**READ “BORN TO SPELL?” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Reading**

 - After students have finished reading “Born to Spell?” with their partners, lead
students in the following activities:


   - ask text-dependent questions that require students to draw on evidence
from the text;


   - identify and discuss general academic (Tier 2) vocabulary;


   - discuss sections of the text that might pose difficulty due to complex
syntax, dense information, challenging transitions, or that require
inferences; and


   - engage students in a culminating writing activity where they compare and
contrast two characters from the text using a Venn diagram.


Observation: Discussion Questions


Call on a different student to answer each question. Note student performance in the

Discussion Questions Observation Record, noting whether the question answered

was literal, inferential, or evaluative, and whether the student answered in a complete

~~**PROGRESS MONITORING (OPTIONAL)**~~


 - Make a copy of the Word Cards for Progress Monitoring 1 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 5.2** ). Cut apart the word cards.


 - Make one copy of the Record Sheet for Progress Monitoring 1 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 5.3** ) for each student you are assessing.


 - Model with the sample item.


 - Show the cards to the student one at a time. Use the Record Sheet to record
each word as the student reads.


 - Place a check next to each word read correctly.


 - For misread words, write exactly what students say as the word is sounded
out. If students misread a word, prompt them to try to read the word again,
letting them know their first attempt was incorrect.


**Scoring:** Scoring is based on one point assigned for every sound/spelling in
a word which is read correctly. Interpret scores as follows:


   - 11 or 12 points—excellent


   - 8–10 points—good


   - Less than 8 points—poor


**Goal:** Achieve scores of good or excellent (11 points or higher).


Scores of 7 or less indicate additional reteaching and reinforcement is
required. Further analyze student errors to determine whether there are
one or more particularly problematic sound-spellings. The subtotals for
targeted sound/spellings at the bottom of the Record Sheet facilitate the
identification of specific problem areas.


Also examine whether there are mispronunciations occurring more
frequently in a given position in words. For example, does the student read
the initial sound correctly but misread the medial and/or final sound?


Finally, examine whether the student succeeded in reading words correctly
on the second attempt. If so, the student may be rushing and may benefit
from explicit instruction to slow down and look at each letter in a word
sequentially, left to right.

Foundational Skills 3


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Over the next several lessons you will teach spelling alternatives for the /oe/
sound. The spellings to be treated include the basic code spelling ‘o_e’ as in
_home_ and the spelling alternatives ‘o’ as in _open_, ‘oa’ as in _boat_, and ‘oe’ as in
_toe_ . The chart below shows you which of these spellings are most common
for this sound. The spelling ‘ow’ for /oe/ will be taught later, since students
just learned in Unit 2 to link the spelling ‘ow’ with /ow/. Students should
already know the basic code spelling ‘o_e’ as in _home_ . Some may be familiar
with the spellings ‘o’, ‘ow’, ‘oa’, and ‘oe’ from Grade 1.


Here are some patterns for your information:


  - The ‘ **o** ’ spelling is actually much more common than the basic code spelling
‘ **o_e** ’. However, it was not chosen as the basic code spelling for two reasons:
(1) ‘o’ is the basic code spelling for /o/ as in _hot_, and (2) ‘o’ > /oe/ is less
common in one-syllable words used in beginning reading materials ( _most_, _no_,
_so_, _go_ ) than it is in multisyllable words ( _only_, _noble_, _solo_, _hoping_ ).


  - Many ‘o_e’ words change to just ‘o’ when a suffix is added (e.g., _hope_  _hoping_ and _joke_   - _joker)_ .


  - At the beginning of a word, ‘o’ and ‘ **oa** ’ are the most likely spellings ( _over_,
_obey_, _oak_, _oat_ ); ‘ow’ is rarely used ( _own_ ).


  - In the middle of a word, with consonant spellings on either side, ‘o’, ‘oa’, and
‘o_e’ are all used ( _fold_, _groan_, _hope_ ); ‘ow’ is rare ( _grown_ ); and ‘oe’ is rarely, if
ever, used.


Lesson 6 Spelling Alternatives: The /oe/ Sound and Its Spellings
**79**


**80**




 - At the end of a word, ‘o’, ‘ **ow** ’, and ‘ **oe** ’ are used ( _hippo_, _snow_, _toe_ ); ‘oa’ is very
rare ( _cocoa_ ).


 - The spellings ‘ **ou** ’ as in _shoulder_ and ‘ **ough** ’ as in _though_ are rare and are not
taught in this program. Students can be introduced to these spellings as they
happen to discover them, or they can learn words containing these spellings
as Tricky Words.


**Foundational Skills**

 - You will need to create two more Spelling Trees, one for the /oe/ sound and
its spellings and another for the /o/ sound and its spellings. Each tree should
have five branches. Follow the directions from Lesson 1 regarding assembly
of the Spelling Tree. Have the materials needed to construct the Spelling Tree
ready before you begin the exercise. If lack of wall space is an issue, display
the Spelling Trees on a chart tablet.


 - You are encouraged to keep the Spelling Tree for /ae/ on display or
accessible for viewing even as you begin working on /oe/. The trees are
useful resources for students to consult when spelling. If the /ae/ and /a/
trees are movable, you may wish to move them to a less central location.


 - Label the trunk of one Spelling Tree /o/ and the other /oe/.


 - For the /oe/ Spelling Tree, use four branches for the spellings (‘o_e’, ‘o’, ‘oe’,
‘oa’); and one branch at the top for odd ducks. Odd ducks are words having
the /oe/ sound spelled in a way not explicitly taught in this unit. The second
Spelling Tree should have five branches, all for words with short /o/.


 - Label five of the branches on the /o/ Spelling Tree ‘o’. The branches should
be the same length.


 - Label the /oe/ Spelling Tree branches individually as ‘o_e’, ‘o’, ‘oe’, ‘oa’, and
odd ducks.


 - Write these /oe/ words on the leaves: _coat_, _goes_, _road_, _so_, _poke_, _hoe_, _open_,
_toe_ . Also write these /o/ words on other leaves: _cot_, _rod_, _top_, _stop_, _chop_,
_clock_, _rotten_ .

**Primary Focus**
Students will provide words for sorted columns featuring /oe/ > ‘o_e’, ‘o’, ‘oe’, and
‘oa’, and will read words with these features and attach them to the appropriate
branch of the Spelling Tree. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii**~~


Students will read and answer yes/no questions featuring words with /ae/
sound/spellings and will read pairs of words with /a/ and /ae/ spelling patterns
and will determine if the spellings produce identical sounds.

~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii**~~


~~**BOARD SORT /O/ AND /OE/ (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that Unit 2 and Unit 3 focus on vowel sounds. Today they
will review the basic code for the /o/ sound. Write ‘o’ on the board and ask
students what sound they would make if they saw this spelling. _(/o/ as_
_in_ hop _)_


  - Ask students to share six to eight words containing the /o/ sound. Write the
words on the board, and circle the ‘o’ in each word. Point out that in all of
these words the /o/ sound is spelled as ‘o’.


  - Tell students the new vowel sound for today is the /oe/ sound, as in _open_ .
Have students say the sound /oe/.


  - Remind students they have already learned one spelling for this sound, ‘o_e’.


  - Ask students to provide six to eight words with the ‘o_e’ spelling. Record
these words on the board under the column ‘o_e’; use two-finger pointing as
you did in Unit 2 to highlight the spelling and circle it with a horseshoe loop.


  - Tell students there are other ways to write the /oe/ sound and, over the next
few days, they are going to learn several additional spellings for the sound.


  - Write the following headers on the board in columns: ‘o_e’, ‘o’, ‘oe’, and ‘oa’.


  - Ask students to share any words containing the /oe/ sound (not the letter
‘o’; but the sound /oe/).


**TEKS 2.2.B.iii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open syllables; VC _e_ syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables.


Foundational Skills 3


 - Sort the /oe/ words students provide according to the spellings, and circle
the letters standing for the /oe/ sound in each word. For example, if a
student says _boat_, list the word under the heading ‘oa’. If a student says
_rowboat_, list the word twice, under ‘oa’ and odd ducks.


 - Call students’ attention to the four spelling patterns for the /oe/ sound.


 - Below are examples of words students may provide. Each column represents
the major spellings of the long vowel sound /oe/ taught in this unit.


**Note:** If students provide a word that contains an /oe/ spelling not taught
in this unit (e.g., _snow_ or _crow_ ), record the word in the column labeled ‘odd
ducks’ to acknowledge that the student correctly provided a word with the
/oe/ sound, but with a spelling not yet taught. However, do not list words in
the odd ducks column unless students suggest these words.

|/oe/ > ‘o_e’|/oe/ > ‘o’|/oe/ > ‘oe’|/oe/ > ‘oa’|odd ducks|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|tote|no|toe|goat|snow|
|stone|hotel|doe|foat|crow|



 - Students will most likely suggest examples of most of the major spelling
patterns, but you should not introduce any spellings listed that are not offered
spontaneously by students (with the exception of odd ducks). You can do this
by writing one of the sample words on the board, reading the word to students,
and then asking them which letters stand for the /oe/ sound in the word.


 - Leave the words from the sort on the board, as you will add some of them to
the Spelling Tree in the next exercise.


~~**SPELLING TREES /O/ AND /OE/ (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Show students the new Spelling Trees, and explain you are going to use one
tree to help them keep track of the spellings for the /oe/ sound and the other
to keep track of spellings for the /o/ sound.


 - Point out that the odd ducks branch is the shortest. Words with unusual
spellings are called odd ducks. Odd ducks are Tricky Words, and like Tricky
Words, odd ducks are on yellow paper.


 - Explain that the branches are like the power bar because they show how
common a spelling is for a sound; longer branches represent more common
spellings, and shorter branches represent less common spellings.

 - Show students the /o/ leaves you prepared in advance. Ask students to
read one word at a time. Then ask a student to tell you which Spelling Tree
the leaf belongs to and tape it to the tree. Continue until all of the /o/ leaves
have been read and displayed on the tree. Call students’ attention to the fact
that the /o/ sound is spelled only one way: every word with the /o/ sound
is spelled with ‘o’, and all the branches of the /o/ Spelling Tree represent the
exact same spelling.


 - Show students the leaves you prepared with the /oe/ sound. First read the
words with the ‘o_e’ spelling, emphasizing this is the /oe/ sound. Again, ask
students to tell you where the leaves/words belong and tape them to the
correct branch of the Spelling Tree.


 - Continue showing students the other leaves with the /oe/ sound and
different spellings. You should read the words aloud to students since these
spellings have not yet been explicitly taught, emphasizing the /oe/ sound.
Ask a student to tell you where each leaf/word belongs and tape it to the
correct branch of the /oe/ Spelling Tree.


 - After all words have been read and taped to the tree, point out that, unlike the
/o/ sound, the /oe/ sound can be spelled in several different ways. Point out
each branch and its specific spellings.


 - Choose one or two words of each spelling from the word sort to write on a
leaf. Copy the word, read it aloud, and have a student attach it to the correct
branch. If students came up with any odd ducks during the board sort, they
can be copied onto the yellow duck-shaped cards.


 - Ask a student to tell you on which branch each leaf belongs and tape it to the
Spelling Tree.


 - Explain that you will be using the Spelling Tree as an organizer for the next
several lessons of work on the /oe/ sound and its spellings. Students will
have chances to add more words to the tree.

Group 1 should be comprised of students needing remediation, while Group 2
should be made up of more independent learners. You will want to decide in
advance how you will divide your class. Please remember a student placed in
Group 1 one week may be in Group 2 for the next.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Foundational Skills**

  - Write the following words on leaves to add to the Spelling Tree for this lesson:
_hotel, moment, program, bonus, poster, poet, polo, halo, open, omit, over_ .


  - You should bold or underline the /oe/ spellings for the sound on the
leaves above.


**Note:** The multisyllable words for the Spelling Tree should be written on the
leaves without any syllable division. The words _no_ and _so_, taught earlier as
Tricky Words, can now be read as part of the /oe/ > ‘o’ spelling pattern. They
should be removed from the Tricky Word wall and placed on the decodable
word wall.


  - Prepare to display the Vowel Code Flip Book within view of all students; have
the Spelling Cards listed in the Lesson at a Glance chart, student Individual
Code Charts, and green markers readily available.

**Lesson 8: Tricky Spelling ‘o’**
30M
Foundational Skills


**Primary Focus**
Students will hear and distinguish between oral words with the /o/ and /oe/
sounds. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii**~~


Students will read one- and two-syllable words with the tricky spelling ‘o’ > /oe/
and will compare these words with words featuring ‘o’ > /o/.

~~**TEKS 2.2.B.i; TEKS 2.2.B.iii; TEKS 2.2.B.v**~~


Students will read and write words with /oe/ > ‘o’, ‘oa’, ‘oe’, and ‘o_e’ in sorted
columns. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii; TEKS 2.2.C.i; TEKS 2.2.C.iv**~~


~~**TRICKY SPELLING ‘O’ (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Review the spellings for /oe/ by reading words from these branches: ‘o_e’,
‘oa’, ‘oe’.


  - Tell students today they will focus on another spelling for the /oe/ sound,
the spelling ‘o’. Point out the ‘o’ branch on the /oe/ Spelling Tree to students,
noting the length of the branch. Let students know the letter ‘o’ can be used to
represent the /oe/ sound and the /o/ sound. So the ‘o’ can be a tricky spelling.


  - The spellings can be found on the following pages in the Vowel Code Flip
Book and in students’ Individual Code Charts.


  - Turn to **Vowel Code Flip Book page 11** and show students the ‘o’ Spelling
Card for /oe/, as well as the target word on the card. Write the word _open_
on the board/chart paper as _open_ . Point to the ‘o’ at the end of the syllable.
Explain when the letter ‘o’ comes at the end of a syllable, it represents the /
oe/ sound. Sound out the word with students using the /oe/ sound. Put the
Spelling Card on the appropriate space. Discuss the power bar.


**TEKS 2.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (iii) decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open
syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables; (i)
decoding words with short, long, or variant vowels, trigraphs, and blends; (v) decoding words using knowledge of syllable division patterns such as VCCV, VCV, and VCCCV; **TEKS 2.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling one-syllable words with closed syllables; open syllables: VCe syllables: vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled
syllables, and final stable syllables; (iv) spelling multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns.

**106**


- Distribute the green markers. Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart**
**page 8.** Guide students in outlining the appropriate card on the chart.


- Tell students they now know four spellings for the sound /oe/: ‘oe’, ‘o’, ‘oa’,
and ‘o_e’.


- Write the following words on the board/chart paper, one at a time, circling the
/oe/ spellings. Read each word aloud as a class.



1. hotel


2. moment


3. program


4. bonus


5. poster


6. poet



7. polo


8. halo


9. open


10. omit


11. over




- Point out in each instance that the letter ‘o’ represents the /oe/ sound
because the ‘o’ comes at the end of a syllable.


- Hold up one of the leaves you prepared, and ask students to read the word.
Then have a student tape the leaf to the ‘o’ branch of the /oe/ Spelling Tree.


- Compare and contrast ‘o’ > /o/ words with those ‘o’ > /oe/ words. Write the
words in the following box on the board/chart paper to demonstrate the
spelling pattern.

 - Ask students to tear out Activity Page 8.1.


 - Explain the words in the box are all one-syllable words containing the sound
/oe/ spelled either ‘oa’, ‘o’, ‘o_e’, or ‘oe’.


 - Tell students you want them to sort the words by spelling and writing them in
the correct columns.


 - Point out the first four words are already sorted.


 - Have students read the next word in the box, _rope_ . Ask students to first circle
the letters that spell the /oe/ sound, read the word, and then tell you where
to write the word.


 - Add the word to the correct column. Have the class do the same on their
activity pages.


 - Point out that ‘o’ is the most common spelling for /oe/, especially in words
with two or three syllables.


 - Repeat this process until all of the words have been read and sorted. Have
students read any remaining words in the box as a class before working
independently on the activity page.


 - Have students use the back of Activity Page 8.1 to write a sentence with as
many of the words from the box as possible.

**Lesson 8: “The Swimming Sisters”**
Reading



20M



**Primary Focus:** Students will read “The Swimming Sisters” with purpose and
understanding; will answer text-dependent questions, discuss Tier 2 vocabulary
and difficult passages from the text; and will fill out a Venn diagram based on key
details from the story. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii; TEKS 2.2.B.iv; TEKS 2.2.B.vi; TEKS 2.2.C.iii;**~~


~~**TEKS 2.2.C.vi; TEKS 2.3.C; TEKS 2.7.C; TEKS 2.8.B**~~


~~**INTRODUCE THE STORY (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students the next series of stories is about two sisters, Kim and Val
Castro, who swim. Remind students a series means there is more than one
of something. Ask students to look in the table of contents to determine how
many stories make up the series about swimming. ( _four_ )


  - Explain to students there are many different water sports. Some people
practice fancy dives into the water, some dance under the water, and some
teams play games like water polo. These stories are about sisters who train
to race in the water, trying to swim the fastest.


  - Remind students what they have learned about decoding and spelling
common abbreviations, such as for days of the week. Explain that in this
story, they will see Sunday spelled out. Have them use their own paper to
write abbreviation for Sunday. ( _Sun._ ) Then have them write abbreviations for
other days of the week.


  - Have students identify suffixes _-er_ and _-est_ as they read. (e.g., faster, fastest)
Tell students that the ending _-er_ makes a comparison between two things
and means “more”: Kim is _faster_ than Val. Explain that the ending _-est_ shows
a comparison between three or more things and means “most”: Kim is the

and superlatives by adding the endings to base words. Have students make
a list of words with _-er_ and _-est_ as they read. Then have them draw lines to
separate the base word from the suffix for each one and write what the word
means.


**Preview Spellings**

 - Refer to the chart you prepared in advance to preview the spellings before
reading the story. Point out the word _faster_, and tell students that adding
the inflectional ending - _er_ to the word _fast_ changes the meaning of the word.
The word _fast_ describes how quickly something happens, while the word
_faster_ is a comparative word that describes how quickly something happens
compared to something else. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.vi; TEKS 2.3.C**~~

Today students will work in small groups. The purpose of small groups is
to provide time for you to work directly with a smaller group of students so
you can provide more individual attention. Group 1 should be comprised of
students needing remediation, while Group 2 should be made up of more
independent learners. You will want to decide in advance how you will divide
your class. Please remember a student placed in Group 1 one week may be in
Group 2 for the next.

 - Point to the branches on the /oe/ Spelling Tree and read one word from
each branch.


 - Write the words you recorded on the leaves on the board/chart paper:


1. ‘oa’: oatmeal, raincoat, steamboat


2. ‘oe’: toenail


3. ‘o_e’: tadpole, enclose, explode


4. ‘o’: bonus, hippo, frozen, focus, locate, condo


 - Read each word on the board/chart paper together as a class.


 - After reading each word, summarize the information about the sound
and spelling.


 - Distribute the prepared leaves to student pairs.


 - Ask students to read the word together and circle the spelling.


 - Ask each student pair to show the class their leaf, read the word aloud, and say
which /oe/ and/or /o/ spelling the word contains. Students can then tape their
leaf to the appropriate branch on the /oe/ and/or the /o/ Spelling Tree.


~~**TRICKY SPELLING ‘O’ (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Write _ovals_ on the board/chart paper, but do not read the word aloud or ask
students to say the word.


 - Write _o|val_ and _ov|als_ underneath _ovals_ . Explain that both of these are ways
students might try chunking the letters into syllables.


 - Tell students, “I am going to say a sentence using this word. I want you to
listen carefully and then decide how to say this word.”


 - Say, “There are many shapes: circles, squares, triangles, and .”


 - Point to the syllables of the first word and model how to sound out each
syllable as it is divided. _O|vals_ is pronounced /oe/ /vulz/ with the /oe/ sound.


 - Now point to the syllables in the second word and model sounding out the
word as it is divided in _ov|als_ . It is pronounced /ov/ /ulz/ with the short vowel
/o/ sound because the ‘o’ is followed by a consonant.


Foundational Skills 3


 - Ask students which pronunciation makes sense ( _o|vals_ ). Circle _o|vals_ .


 - Review the patterns of the long ‘o’ versus the short ‘o’ sound (i.e., ‘o’ is
pronounced as /oe/ at the end of a syllable and as /o/ if it is followed
by a consonant).

  - Repeat this procedure, using the chart you prepared in advance or the digital
version. Then use the target word in an oral sentence, alternately pointing
and saying the /oe/ and /o/ sound depending on how the syllables are
divided. Ask students which word makes sense and then circle the

4. **Evaluative.** Compare and contrast the different training and practice Val and Kim
use to get ready for a race and why.


» Val trains for her races by swimming many laps without stopping. This is

good training for Val because the races in which she competes are long

distance races and she must swim many laps to win.


» Kim trains for her races by practicing getting a good start from the

starting block. She swims just a short distance and then goes back to the

starting block to practice her start over and over. This is good training

for Kim because the races in which she competes are short distances, so

getting a good start is very important to win the race.

Foundational Skills 3


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Over the next several lessons you will teach spelling alternatives for the
/ ie/ sound. The spellings include the basic code spelling ‘i_e’ as in _bite_ and
the spelling alternatives ‘i’ as in _biting_ and ‘ie’ as in _tie_ . The chart shows you
which of these spellings are most common for this sound. The spellings ‘y’
and ‘igh’ for /ie/ will be taught later in the program. Students should already
know the basic code spelling ‘i_e’ as in _bite_ . Some may also be familiar with
the spellings ‘i’ and ‘ie’. (These spellings are taught in Grade 1.)


Here are some patterns for your information:


  - The ‘ **i_e** ’ separated digraph spelling is never used for the final sound in a
word or syllable; there is always a consonant sound that follows /ie/, and the
spelling for that consonant sound is inserted between the ‘i’ and the ‘e’ ( _bite_,
_tide_, _like_ ).


  - Many ‘i_e’ words change to ‘i’ words when a suffix is added (e.g., _time_  _timing_ and _bike_   - _biking)_ . The ‘e’ is dropped when a suffix beginning with a
vowel sound is added.


  - The ‘ **i** ’ spelling is actually more common than the basic code spelling ‘i_e’.
However, it was not chosen as the basic code spelling for two reasons: (1)
‘i’ is the basic code spelling for /i/ as in _hit_, and (2) ‘i’ > /ie/ ( _find_, _mind_ )
is much less common than ‘i_e’ > /ie/ ( _fine_, _mine_, _dine_ ) in one-syllable
words used in beginning reading materials; ‘i’ > /ie/ is primarily found in
multisyllable words.


  - The ‘i’ spelling is rare in one-syllable words; when it is used in one-syllable
words, it is often found in front of final consonant clusters ( _mind_, _find_,
_mild_, _ninth_ ).


Lesson 11 Spelling Alternatives: The /ie/ Sound and Its Spellings
**145**


**146**




  - ‘i’ ( _item_, _ivory_ ) and ‘i_e’ ( _ice_, _time_ ) are the only spellings regularly used at the
beginning of a word or syllable.


  - ‘ **ie** ’ can be seen as a variant of the basic code spelling ‘i_e’ in which the same
letters are written side by side.


 - ‘ie’ is generally used at the end of a word or syllable ( _pie_ ); it is rare in the
initial or medial positions, though ‘ie’ can be followed by grammatical suffixes
( _ties_, _tied_, _fries_, _fried_ ).


 - Some rare spellings for /ie/ not taught here include ‘ **ei** ’ as in _Einstein_, ‘ **ai** ’ as
in _Thailand_, ‘ **ye** ’ as in _bye_, and ‘ **y_e** ’ as in _type_ . Students can be introduced
to these spellings as they happen to encounter them in reading materials or
when they need them for writing.


**Foundational Skills**

 - You will need to create two more Spelling Trees for the vowel sounds /ie/ and
/i/ and their spellings. Each tree should have four branches. Please follow the
directions from Lesson 1 regarding assembly of the Spelling Tree. Have the
materials you need to make the Spelling Tree before you begin the lesson. If lack
of wall space is a problem, you may display the Spelling Trees on chart tablets.


 - For the /ie/ Spelling Tree, label three branches with the following spellings,
‘i_e’, ‘ie’, ‘i’, and the fourth branch as odd ducks. Label all four of the branches
of the /i/ Tree with ‘i’. To determine the relative length of the branches, refer
to the chart below. There you will see the ‘i’ branch should be the longest as ‘i’
is a spelling for /ie/ 42% of the time. ‘i_e’ should be the next longest branch
as this is a spelling for /ie/ 34% of the time. ‘ie’ should be the shortest
branch as it occurs in only 2% of words with the sound /ie/.

digraph ‘i_e’ as you did in Unit 2. If a student says _firefly_, record the word both
under ‘i_e’, for the spelling in _fire_, and odd ducks for the spelling ‘y’ for the /ie/
sound as in _fly_ . Some students may recall having learned that ‘y’ can represent
the /ie/ spelling in Grade 1, but we will include it here as an odd duck.


 - You should introduce any spellings listed in the following chart that are not
suggested spontaneously. You can do this by writing one of the sample words
on the board/chart paper, reading the word aloud, and then asking students,
“Which letters stand for the /ie/ sound in this word?”


 - Do not introduce spellings for odd ducks unless they are suggested
by students.


 - Students may occasionally supply a word that contains an /ie/ spelling not
taught in this unit, like _night_ . Record words with spellings that will not be
taught in Unit 3 under a column labeled “odd ducks.”


 - Leave the words from the board sort on display, as you will add some of them
to the Spelling Tree in the next exercise.


 - Below are examples of words students may provide. Each column represents
the major spellings of the long vowel sound /ie/ that will be taught later in
Unit 3; the other spellings for /ie/ are included just as examples under the
“odd ducks” column; do not write words in the “odd ducks” column unless
students provide words with these spellings. ~~**[ TEKS 2.2.B.i ]**~~


~~**SPELLING TREES /I/ AND /IE/ (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Show students the new Spelling Trees and explain you are going to use one
tree to help them keep track of the spellings for the /ie/ sound and the other
to keep track of spellings for the /i/ sound.


 - Label the trunk of one Spelling Tree /i/ and the other /ie/.


 - Label four of the branches on the /i/ Spelling Tree ‘i’. The branches should be
the same length.


 - Label the /ie/ branches as ‘i_e’, ‘ie’, ‘i’, and odd ducks. Explain that the
branches are like the power bar because they show how common a spelling

is for a sound; shorter branches represent less common sounds and longer
branches represent more common sounds.


 - Point out the odd ducks branch is the shortest. Explain that words with
unusual spellings are called odd ducks. Odd ducks are Tricky Words, and like
Tricky Words, odd ducks are on yellow paper.


 - Choose one to two words for each spelling from the board sort to write on a
leaf. Copy the word, read it aloud, and have a student attach it to the correct
branch. If students came up with any odd ducks during the board sort, they
can be copied onto the yellow duck-shaped cards.


 - Ask students to tell you which branch the leaf belongs to and tape it to the tree.


 - Explain that you will be using the Spelling Tree as an organizer for the next
several days of work on the sound /ie/ and its spellings. Students will have
chances to add more words to the tree.


Observation: Spelling Alternatives


Ask as many students as possible to read a word and place the leaf on the Spelling

Tree. Make note of their individual ability to decode words with /ie/ > ‘i’, ‘ie’, ‘i_e’; and

/i/ > ‘i’ in the Spelling Alternatives Observation Record.


~~**PRACTICE /IE/ AND /AE/ (10 MIN.)**~~


 - First read the words in the box as a class, writing the words syllable by
syllable on the board/chart paper, if necessary. Use the routine provided in
the Additional Support section to help students decode multisyllabic words
using syllable division patterns.


 - Then ask a student to read each sentence aloud as all students select and
write the correct word in the blank. Have students use the back of each
Activity Page to write a new sentence with the words in the box.

 - Write _Grover, bandit_, and _Castro_ on the board.


 - Say, “In _Grover_, I see two vowel sounds (/oe/ and /er/) on either side of one
consonant.”


 - Say, “When only one consonant comes between two vowels, I divide after the
first vowel sound. So I will divide the word like this _Gro•ver_ .”


 - Point to _bandit_ .


 - Say, “In this word, I see two vowels on either side of two consonants.”


 - Underline the vowels.


 - Say, “When two consonants come between two vowels, I divide the word
between the consonants: _ban•dit_ .”


 - Point to _Castro_ .


 - Say, “In this word, I see a vowel on either side of three consonants in a row.”


 - Underline the _vowels_ .


 - Say, “When three consonants come between two vowels, I divide either
before or after the first two consonants, depending on the consonants. In this
case, ‘s’ and ‘t’ blend together, so I will divide the syllables like this: _Cast•ro_ .”

- Unscramble the sentence and write the words in the correct order. (The
sentence can be rewritten as a statement or a question.) Remind students to
pay attention to capitalization and punctuation. ( _Kate did get a red notebook._
or _Did Kate get a red notebook?_ )


- Leave this sentence on the board/chart paper.


- Review with students that a noun is a word that names a person, place,
or thing. Then have students identify the nouns in the sentence. ( _Kate_,
_notebook_ )


- Now write the word _boy_ on the board/chart paper. Say, “If I say, ‘A boy in
our class is sitting nicely in his chair,’ which word is the noun that names a
person?” ( _boy_ )


- Ask students, “Do we know which boy I am talking about? If I say ‘(insert
student’s name) is sitting nicely in his chair,’ do we know which boy I am
talking about?”


- Make two columns on the board/chart paper labeled _Common_ and _Proper_ . A
common noun is a general person, place, or thing. A proper noun tells us the
name of a specific person, place, or thing. Tell students proper nouns always begin
with a capital letter because they are a specific name of a person, place, or thing.


- Write _Bill_ on the board/chart paper beside _boy_ .


- Explain that _Bill_ is a specific noun because it tells exactly which boy we are
talking about. _Bill_ is a proper noun and must begin with a capital letter, but
_boy_ is a common noun so it begins with a lowercase letter.


- Repeat with the following word pairs, emphasizing which one is a proper
noun because it names a specific person, place, or thing.

Check for Understanding


**Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down:** Say different words to students using common and

proper nouns. Have students give thumbs-up whenever they hear a proper noun and

thumbs-down when they hear a common noun. Use the following list or make up your

own: _school_, _Mrs_ . _Johnson_, _Washington Street_, _mom_, _Saturday_, _cake_ .


 - Display the sentences you prepared in advance.

them change the first letter in any proper noun to a capital letter and circle
the proper noun. Remind students to look for any other words that should
begin with a capital letter (first word in the sentence) and place the correct
punctuation mark at the end of the sentence.

**Note to Teacher**


You will need to have the following six Spelling Trees displayed within view of
students: /a/, /ae/, /o/, /oe/, /i/, and /ie/. If the Spelling Trees are displayed
on a single chart pad, you can modify the directions as indicated in the next
review activity.


Today students will work on decoding the tricky spelling ‘i’. This spelling poses
a challenge for readers because it can be pronounced /i/ as in _it_, or /ie/ as
in _biting_ . It may also be pronounced /ee/ as in _ski_ . We will not teach the /ee/


Lesson 13 Spelling Alternatives: Tricky Spelling ‘i’ › /i/ and /ie/
**175**


spelling in this unit. The chart shows /i/ is the most common pronunciation. If
students come across an unfamiliar printed word containing the letter ‘i’, they
should try pronouncing the ‘i’ as /i/. If it does not sound like a word, or if the
resulting word does not make sense in context, the students should try /ie/.


Here are some patterns for your information:


 - ‘i’ is almost always pronounced /i/ when it is followed by a double-letter spelling
for a consonant sound ( _itty_, _bidding_, _dinner_, _dimmer_ ). The double-letter spelling
is a marker for the “short” pronunciation of the preceding vowel spelling.


 - ‘i’ is usually pronounced /i/ in CVC words and syllables, where the ‘i’ is
surrounded on either side by consonant spellings ( _hit_, _did_, _finish_ ).


 - At the end of a syllable, ‘i’ is likely to be pronounced /ie/ ( _Viking_, _biting_, i _con_,
_item_ ). Unfortunately, without syllable dividers it can be hard to tell if the
syllable is open or closed.

- Guide students in telling you the letters to circle that spell the /ie/ or /i/
sounds. Ask students which letters you should circle, circle the letters, and
read each word. Tell students that the they can divide the first word by using
the syllable division pattern VCCV: _in•vite_ . They can divide the second word
using the VCV pattern: _i•tem_ . Continue having students identify the pattern
for each word. Then proceed with the next word.


- Tell students sometimes a spelling is shared by two sounds. Point out that ‘i’
can be a spelling for /i/ or /ie/.


- Explain that when a spelling can be pronounced more than one way, we call it
a tricky spelling.


- Point out that in _Kids Excel_ and in other books they will read, multisyllable
words are not written with spaces. This means students will need to look at
the word by themselves and determine how to break the word into syllables
and sound it out in chunks.


- Write _pilot_ on the board/chart paper, but do not read the word aloud or ask
students to say the word at this time.


- Tell students, “I am going to say a sentence using this word. I want you to
listen carefully and then decide how to say this word.”


- Write _pi_ | _lot_ and _pil_ | _ot_ underneath _pilot_ . Explain that both of these are ways
students might try chunking the letters into syllables.


- Say, “The person who flies a plane is called a .”


- Point to the syllables of the first word and model how to sound out each
syllable as it is divided. _Pi_ | _lot_ is pronounced as /pie/ /lit/, with the /ie/ sound
in the first syllable.


- Now point to the syllables in the second word and model sounding out the
word as it is divided; _pil_ | _ot_ is pronounced with the /i/ sound, /pil/ /it/.


- Ask students which pronunciation is a word that makes sense to finish the



Support


There are two common
pronunciations of pilot.
Another one is “p ī -l ə t”,
which is pronounced as

 - Repeat this procedure using the chart you prepared in advance. Use the
target word in an oral sentence, pointing to and saying the /ie/ and /i/
sounds depending on how the syllables are divided. Ask students which word
makes sense and then circle the correct word.

 - Explain that seeing the letter ‘i’ in a word creates a “tug-of-war,” with each of
the /i/ and /ie/ sounds pulling on it.


 - Remind students that if the ‘i’ is surrounded by consonants, it represents the
/i/ sound; if it comes at the end of a syllable, it represents the /ie/ sound.


 - Tell students that when they see an unfamiliar word with the ‘i’ spelling,
they should try pronouncing the ‘i’ as /i/ because /i/ is the most frequent
pronunciation of ‘i’; if it does not sound right or does not make sense in
context, they should try /ie/.

  - Direct students’ attention to the lines on the bottom of the activity page.
Tell students to write this sentence on the lines: _All whales swim in the sea._
Slowly repeat this phrase twice.


  - After all the words have been called out, tell students you will now show them
the correct spelling for each word so they can correct their own work.

later time today, you may find it helpful to use the analysis tools provided in Teacher

Resources to analyze students’ mistakes to identify any new or persistent patterns

among individual students.


~~**PLURAL NOUNS (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Hold up a pen and write the word _pen_ on the board/chart paper.


  - Ask students what you are holding. ( _a pen_ ) Tell students that _pen_ is a _singular_
_noun_, meaning it names one object, or one pen.


  - Hold up two pens and ask students how many you are holding up now. ( _two_ )
Ask students how you would say the word that names more than one pen.
( _pens_ ) Ask students what you would add to the word pen to spell the word
that names more than one pen. ( _add an –s_ )


  - Explain that when a noun names more than one of something it is called a
_plural noun_ . _Plural_ means there are two or more of something. Point out that
the _–s_ in plural nouns is not always pronounced /s/. Point out _pens_ has the
buzzy sound /z/.


  - Repeat with other nouns, writing both the singular and plural forms: _boy,_
_finger, pencil, marker, tablet_ . Point out the addition of an _–s_ to each singular
noun to make a plural noun meaning more than one.


  - Write the word _dish_ on the board/chart paper. Ask students if this is a
singular noun that names one or a plural noun that names more than one.
( _singular noun_ )


  - Tell students you want to make this word plural (more than one). Add _–s_ to
the word. Have students try to say the word in its plural form to mean more
than one dish if the word had an _–s_ at the end. Ask if they would say “ _dishs_ ”?
(/d/ /i/ /sh/ /s/) Have them listen very carefully as you say the word
correctly. Determine if students can decide how it would be spelled. ( _dishes_ )

~~**TEKS 2.2.C.vi**~~


**TEKS 2.2.C.vi** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by spelling words with prefixes, including un-, re-, and dis-, and
inflectional endings, including -s, -es, -ed, -ing, -er, and -est.


Foundational Skills 3


 - Explain that sometimes it is necessary to add _–es_ to the end of a word to
make it plural. Make columns with the headings ‘sh’, ‘ch’, ‘s’, ‘x’. Tell students
if a word ends in the sound/spelling represented by these letters, they must
add _–es_ to the end of the word. Have them say each of those sound/spellings
to hear the sounds they make.

|‘sh’|‘ch’|‘s’|‘x’|
|---|---|---|---|
|dishes|churches|dresses|boxes|
|wishes|ditches|||



 - Say the word _wish_ and ask students under which column this word should be
written. _(‘sh’)_ Have students provide the correct spelling for making _wish_ a
plural noun. Repeat with the following words: _dress, box, church, ditch, fox_ .


 - Now ask students to provide the plural of the word _game_ . When students
realize this word does not end in any of the four spellings in the columns, ask
them how to spell the plural form to mean more than one game. ( _add –s_ ) Ask
students why the word only needed an _–s_ added. ( _It does not end in ‘sh’, ‘ch’,_
_‘s’, or ‘x’._ )


Check for Understanding


Tell students you will say several nouns. If the noun you say is singular, or names just

one object, they should hold up one finger. If the noun you say is plural, or names

more than one object, they should hold up two fingers. Use the following words: _dish,_

_churches, dress, box, foxes, wishes, ditch, dresses._


 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 15.2. Complete the first row as
guided practice.


Activity Page 15.2: Plural Nouns


Collect Activity Page 15.2 to review and monitor students’ ability to convert singular
nouns to plural nouns for words ending in ‘sh’, ‘ch’, ‘s’, and ‘x’.

 - Make one copy of the Record Sheet for Progress Monitoring 4 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 15.3** ) for each student you are assessing.


 - Follow the procedure in Lesson 5.


**Scoring:** Scoring is based on one point assigned for every sound/spelling in
a word which is read correctly. Interpret scores as follows:


   - 14 or 15 points—excellent


   - 11–13 points—good


   - 8–10 points—fair


   - Less than 8 points—poor


**Goal:** Achieve scores of good or excellent (11 points or higher).


Scores of 10 or less indicate additional reteaching and reinforcement is
required. Further analyze student errors to determine whether there are
one or more particularly problematic sound/spellings. The subtotals for
targeted sound/spellings at the bottom of the Record Sheet facilitate the
identification of specific problem areas.


Also examine whether there are mispronunciations occurring more
frequently in a given position in words. For example, does the student read
the initial sound correctly, but misread the medial and/or final sound?


Finally, examine whether the student succeeded in reading words correctly
on the second attempt. If so, the student may be rushing and may benefit
from explicit instruction to slow down and look at each letter in a word
sequentially, left to right.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Over the next several lessons, you will teach spelling alternatives for the /ue/
sound. The spellings include the basic code spelling ‘u_e’ as in _cute_ and the
spelling alternatives ‘u’ as in _unit_ and ‘ue’ as in _cue_ . The chart below shows
you which of these spellings are most common for this sound. Students
should already know the basic code spelling ‘u_e’ as in _cute_ . The spellings
‘u’ and ‘ue’ are likely to be unfamiliar to many students, although some may
have learned to decode these spellings during independent reading.


Here are some patterns for your information:


  - /ue/ is really a sound combination (/y/ + /oo/) rather than a single phoneme.


  - The spelling alternative ‘ **u** ’ is actually more common than the basic code
spelling ‘u_e’. However, ‘ **u_e** ’ was chosen as the basic code spelling because
‘u’ is rarely found in one-syllable words. In addition, ‘u_e’ is analogous to the
other separated digraph spellings taught as basic code spellings (‘a_e’, ‘o_e’,
and ‘i_e’). Finally, ‘u’ is the basic code spelling for /u/.


  - The spelling ‘u’ is not found in one-syllable words, but it is common in twoand three-syllable words ( _future_, _union_, _Cuba_, _utility_ ).


  - In the initial position, /ue/ is likely to be spelled ‘u’ ( _unit_, _united_, _universe_ ), but
there are also other possibilities ( _use_, _Eugene_, _Yugoslavia_ ).


  - At the end of a word, /ue/ is likely to be spelled ‘ **ue** ’ ( _value_, _tissue_ ).


Lesson 16 Spelling Alternatives: The /ue/ Sound and Its Spellings
**207**


 - The spelling ‘ue’ is mainly used at the end of words and syllables ( _argue_,
_continue_ ); it is rarely followed by a consonant spelling, except when the
consonant spelling is a grammatical ending ( _continued_, _argues_ ).


 - The spelling ‘u_e’ always wraps around a consonant spelling, and the ‘e’ is
often the last letter in the word or root ( _cute_, _dispute_, _confuse_ ).


**Note:** There is a minor spelling for the /ue/ sound that is not being taught
here: ‘ **ew** ’ as in _nephew_ . The students have learned _few_ —another word with
this spelling—as a Tricky Word.


**Foundational Skills**

 - In this lesson you will be asked to create two Spelling Tree wall displays: one
for the /u/ sound and one for the /ue/ sound. Have the components you
need to assemble the Spelling Tree ready before you begin the exercise.


 - Make the Spelling Trees as you have done in previous lessons. Each tree
should have four branches. If wall space is an issue, you may display the
Spelling Trees in a chart tablet, with a single tree on each page.


 - Label the trunk of one Spelling Tree /u/ and the other /ue/.


 - Label four branches on the /ue/ Spelling Tree ‘u_e’, ‘u’, ‘ue’, and _odd ducks_ .
The ‘u’ branch should be the longest and on the bottom, the ‘u_e’ branch
is the second longest, and the ‘ue’ is the last. The odd ducks branch is the
shortest branch on the tree.


 - Make multiple copies of the leaf and odd duck templates on green and yellow
paper, respectively. The duck-shaped cards are for odd ducks (i.e., words that
have the /ue/ sound but do not fall into any of the spelling patterns students
are learning). For /ue/, the odd ducks include ‘ew’ as in _few_ .


 - Write words from the board sort on leaves to add to the Spelling Trees. Try to
add at least one word for each spelling pattern from the board sort.

**Primary Focus:** Students will provide words with the /ue/ sounds and will read
words with /ue/ > ‘u_e’, ‘ue’, and ‘u’. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii**~~


~~**BOARD SORT /UE/ › ‘U_E’, ‘UE’, AND ‘U’ (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Students will learn new long vowel sounds and spellings, but first they will
review the basic code for the short vowel sound /u/. Write ‘u’ on the board
and ask students what sound they would say if they saw this spelling.
_(/u/ as in_ but _)_


  - Ask students to provide words that contain the /u/ sound. Write the words
on the board and circle the ‘u’ in each word.


  - Tell students the new vowel sound for today is the /ue/ sound, as in _music_ .
Have students say the sound /ue/.


  - Remind students they have already learned one spelling for this sound,
‘u_e’. Tell them that over the next few days they are going to learn several
additional spellings for the sound.


  - Write the following headers on the board in columns: ‘u_e’, ‘ue’, and ‘u’.


  - Ask students to provide words with the /ue/ sound (not the letter ‘u’ but the
sound /ue/).


  - Students may occasionally supply a word that contains a /ue/ spelling that
will not be taught in this unit. For example, students may provide the word
_nephew_ or _few_ . Record words with spellings that will not be taught in Unit 3
under a column labeled _odd ducks_ .


  - Sort the /ue/ words students provide by spelling and circling the letters for
the /ue/ sound in each word. For example, if a student says _cute_, list the word
under the heading ‘u_e’ and horseshoe loop the separated digraph ‘u_e’. If a
student says _cue_, list the word under the heading ‘ue’ and circle the ‘ue’.


**TEKS 2.2.B.iii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open
syllables; VC _e_ syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables.


Foundational Skills 3


 - Call students’ attention to the three spelling patterns for the long vowel
/ue/ sound.


 - Below are examples of words students may provide. Each column represents
the major spellings of the long vowel sound /ue/ taught in Unit 3; the other
spellings for /ue/ are included under the odd ducks column.

|/ue/ > ‘u_e’|/ue/ > ‘ue’|/ue/ > ‘u’|odd ducks|
|---|---|---|---|
|cute|cue|music|nephew|
|cube|value|human|few|
|refuse|rescue|humid||
|confuse|continue|humor||
|compute||unit||



 - Students should come up with examples of most of the major spelling
patterns, but you may wish to introduce any spellings listed that do not occur
spontaneously (other than the odd ducks). You can do this by writing one of
the sample words on the board, reading the word aloud, and asking, “Which
letters stand for the /ue/ sound in this word?”


 - Leave the words from the board sort on the board, as you will add them to
the Spelling Tree.


~~**SPELLING TREES /U/ AND /UE/ (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Show students the new Spelling Trees and explain you are going to use one
tree to help them keep track of the spellings for the /u/ sound and the other
to keep track of spellings for the /ue/ sound.


 - Explain that you will be using the Spelling Tree as an organizer for the sound
/ ue/ and its spellings.


~~**REVIEW /UE/ › ‘U_E’ (5 MIN.)**~~

~~**INTRODUCE SPELLING WORDS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - The words this week are antonyms and synonyms.


  - Review the concept of antonyms—words that are opposites, like _hot_ and _cold_ .
Then, introduce the concept of synonyms. Synonyms are words that mean
almost the same thing, like _hot_ and _warm_ .


  - Tell students one way to remember synonyms is that the word _synonym_ starts
with the same letter as _same_, ‘s’.


  - Display the spelling chart you prepared in advance. (The antonyms and
synonyms will be filled in by the class as you introduce each word.)


**TEKS 2.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (i) decoding words with short, long, or variant vowels, trigraphs,
and blends; (iii) decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including
digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables; (v) decoding words using knowledge of syllable
division patterns such as VCCV, VCV, and VCCCV; **TEKS 2.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling
one-syllable words with closed syllables; open syllables: VCe syllables: vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs;

  - Read each of the first five spelling words aloud. As you read each word, ask
students to provide you with an antonym for the spelling word; record each
antonym in the chart.


  - Now read the remaining five spelling words aloud, asking students to provide you
with a synonym for the spelling word; record each synonym in the chart.


  - Remind students to use what they have learned about syllable division patterns
to decode the words. For example, _under_ is a VCCV word, which they can divide
un•der. _Over_ is a VCV word that they can divide _o•ver_, and _subtract_ is a VCCCV
word that they can divide _sub•tract_ .


  - Then tell students that they will write two sentences that you dictate using one of
the spelling words and its synonym or antonym. Students may use their Dictation
Journal.


  - Read the sentences: _The brave dog swam across. The scared bird flew away_ .

 - You may also wish to include _skip_, _add_, _draw 1_, _draw 2_, _draw 3_, and
_reverse_ cards.


 - Each word should be one of four colors (suits), and there should be an equal
number of each color.


 - Give each player five cards to start. Put the rest of the deck in the middle,
and flip the top card over next to the deck. This faceup card becomes the
discard pile.


 - Taking turns, each student can either play a card that is the same color or that
starts with the same letter as the card at the top of the discard pile. To be able
to play a card, a student must correctly read the card or lose his or her turn.


 - If a student does not have a card that is either the same color or that starts
with the same letter as the top card of the discard pile, then he or she can
draw from the deck. If there are no more cards left in the deck, shuffle the
discard pile, which becomes the new deck.

  - Have students tell you which nouns are singular and which are plural. Write
‘S’ (for singular) or ‘P’ (for plural) above the two nouns in the sentence.


  - Ask students to turn to Activity Pages 17.2 and 17.3 and determine which
nouns are singular and which nouns are plural by identifying the inflectional
endings - _s_ and - _es_ . Complete the first one on each page as guided practice.

**Checkers**

  - Make one copy of the Checkers game board ( **Activity Page TR 7.2** ) for each
pair of students.


  - Copy and cut out one set of Checkers pieces ( **Activity Page TR 7.3** ) and one
set of word cards ( **Activity Page TR 17.1** ) for each pair of students.


  - The rules are the same as regular checkers except that, in order to make a
move, the student must first draw a card and read the word correctly.


**Syllable Division Patterns**

  - Point out that students can use what they know about syllable types, such as
VCV and VCCV, and chunking to read and spell these words.


  - Write _refuse_ and _immune_ on the board.


  - Say, “In _refuse_, I see two vowel sounds (/ee/ and /ue/) on either side of one
consonant.”


  - Say, “When only one consonant comes between two vowels, I divide after the
first vowel sound. So I will divide the word like this _re•fuse_ .”


  - Point to _immune_ .


  - Say, “In this word, I see two vowels on either side of two consonants.”


Foundational Skills 3


  - Underline the vowels.


  - Say: “When two consonants come between two vowels, I divide the word
between the consonants: _im•mune_ .”


**Code Knowledge**


Before today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average 687–838
of those words would be completely decodable.


‘u’ is a tricky spelling; it can be pronounced /u/ as in _hut_, /ue/ as in _united_, and
/oo/ as in _flu_ .


‘ue’ is a tricky spelling; it can be pronounced /ue/ as in _cue_ and /oo/ as in _clue_ .

As students raise their fingers, watch to determine whether they are correctly

identifying whether the word includes /ae/ (1), /a/ (2) or neither (3).


~~**INTRODUCE /AW/**~~ ~~>~~ ~~**‘AW’ AND ‘AU’ (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Write the header ‘aw’ on the board/chart paper and ask students, “If you saw
this spelling in a word, what sound would you say?” (The students should
respond with /aw/ as this sound/spelling was taught in Grade 1.)


 - Tell students that the letters ‘aw’ work together as a digraph, or letter team,
and this spelling is pronounced /aw/.


 - Write the following ‘aw’ words on the board/chart paper under the header
‘aw’ and have students read them:



1. jaw


2. paw


3. saw


4. claw


5. straw



6. dawn


7. lawn


8. crawl


9. shawl


10. awful




- The spellings can be found on the following pages in the Vowel Code Flip
Book and in students’ Individual Code Charts.

 - Show students the Spelling Card for /aw/ > ‘aw’ ( _paw_ ). Have students read
the sample word. Discuss the power bar. Point out the power bar does
not stretch all the way across the card. This means there are some other
spellings for this sound students will study later. Explain these spellings are
shown in the Vowel Code Flip Book but will not appear in the Readers until
students have been introduced to them. Add the Spelling Card for ‘aw’ to
**Vowel Code Flip Book page 17** .


 - Ask students to turn to **Individual Code Chart page 9** . Have them outline
the card for ‘aw’ in green.


 - Repeat the steps for the new spelling /aw/ > ‘au’ ( _Paul_ ), writing the header
‘au’ on the board/chart paper and the following words under the header ‘au’
and have students read them.



1. haul


2. Paul

 - Explain ‘au’ is another way to spell the /aw/ sound. Add the Spelling Card for
‘au’ to **Vowel Code Flip Book page 17** and outline the card and spelling for
‘au’ in green on **Individual Code Chart page 9** .

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Foundational Skills**

  - In this lesson you will be asked to create a Spelling Tree for the /aw/ sound
and its spellings. Have the individual components you will need to assemble
the Spelling Tree during class ready before you begin the lesson.


  - The tree should have four branches that fork off from the central trunk. For
the /aw/ tree, the ‘au’ branch should be the longest, followed by the ‘aw’
branch only a small bit shorter; ‘augh’ is much shorter; and one small branch
at the top is for odd ducks. Remember these branches should reflect the
power bars on the Spelling Cards.


  - Label the trunk /aw/.


  - Label four branches: ‘aw’, ‘au’, ‘augh’, and odd ducks. The ‘au’ branch should
be the longest and on the bottom; the ‘aw’ branch is the second longest; and
the ‘augh’ branch is the last.


  - Label the smallest branch on the tree (or the one with the least open space
around it) odd ducks.


  - Write the following words in advance on the leaves: _yawn_, _hawk_, _crawl_,
_awful_, _awesome_, _because_, _launch_, _taught_, _caught_, _August_, _daughter_ .


  - Make multiple copies of the leaf template and the odd duck template. For
/ aw/, the odd ducks might include ‘ough’ as in _bought._


  - Have the Spelling Cards listed in the Lesson at a Glance chart, student
Individual Code Charts, and green markers readily available.


  - You may wish to tab Vowel Code Flip Book page 17.


**Writing**

) **Digital Component 11.2**


  - Prepare an enlarged version of The Hill and Valley Letters Cursive Modeling
Diagram (Digital Component 11.2) to display for students during cursive
writing instruction.


**Universal Access**

  - Bring in pictures to depict the following words: _yawn_, _hawk_, _crawl_, _launch_,
_August_, _daughter_ to use for the Spelling Tree activity.

**Primary Focus:** Students will respond to oral words by writing their antonyms, will
write a dictated sentence, and will check the spelling after reading the words on the
board. ~~**TEKS 2.2.C.i; TEKS 2.3.D**~~


~~**SPELLING ASSESSMENT (10 MIN.)**~~


  - This week, students are writing synonyms and antonyms. Use the following
chart to call out the words. For this week, it might be too confusing for
students to go back and repeat the words at the end of the assessment. You
will need to be the judge of whether or not to repeat the prompts.

|You say:|They write:|
|---|---|
|1.<br>Write the antonym for_over_.|1.<br>under|
|2.<br>Write the antonym for_ silence_.|2.<br>noise|
|3.<br>Write the antonym for_close_.|3.<br>open|
|4.<br>Write the antonym for_scared_.|4.<br>brave|
|5.<br>Write the antonym for_ugly_.|5.<br>cute|
|6.<br>Write the synonym for_subtract_.|6.<br>minus|
|7.<br>Write the synonym for_ fnal_.|7.<br>last|
|8.<br>Write the synonym for_rival_.|8.<br>foe|
|9.<br>Write the synonym for_bandit_.|9.<br>robber|
|10. Write the synonym for_street_.|10. road|



  - Direct students’ attention to the lines on the bottom of the Activity Page. Tell
students to write the sentence _The cat bandit is brave_ . Slowly repeat this
sentence twice.


  - After all the words have been called out, tell students you will now show them
the correct spelling for each word so that they can correct their own work.


**TEKS 2.2.C.i** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by spelling one-syllable and multisyllabic words with closed
syllables; open syllables; VC _e_ syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable
syllables; **TEKS 2.3.D** Identify, use, and explain the meaning of antonyms, synonyms, idioms, and homographs in context.

  - Say and write each word on the board/chart paper, instructing students to
correct their work by crossing out any incorrect spelling, then copying and
writing the correct spelling next to it.


  - Continue through all the words and then onto the sentence.


Activity Page 20.1: Spelling Assessment


Collect Activity Page 20.1 to review and monitor students’ spelling performance. At a
time later today, you may find it helpful to use the analysis tools provided in
Teacher Resources to analyze students’ mistakes and identify any patterns
beginning to develop or persist among individual students.

Foundational Skills


**Primary Focus:** Students will read one- and two-syllable words with the sound/
spelling /aw/ > ‘augh’ and will add words to the /aw/ Spelling Tree that feature
/aw/ > ‘aw’, ‘au’, and ‘augh’. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii**~~


~~**INTRODUCE /AW/ › ‘AUGH’ (5 MIN.)**~~


**Introduce /aw/ > ‘augh’**

  - Remind students they have already learned two spellings for the /aw/ sound,
‘aw’ and ‘au’. Tell them that today they are going to learn one more spelling
for the sound.


  - Write the spelling ‘augh’ on the board/chart paper and ask students, “If
you saw this spelling in a word, what sound do you think you would say?”
(Students may be able to deduce they should say /aw/. If not, point to the ‘a’
and ‘u’ and tell students this spelling, ‘au’, is also pronounced /aw/.)


  - Tell students that when they see the letters ‘augh’, they should recognize
these letters are working together as a digraph, or letter team, and we say
the sound /aw/.


  - Write the following ‘augh’ words on the board/chart paper and have students
read them.


**TEKS 2.2.B.iii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open
syllables; VC _e_ syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables.

 - The spellings can be found on the following pages in the Vowel Code Flip
Book and in students’ Individual Code Charts.


 - Show students the Spelling Card for /aw/ > ‘augh’ ( _caught_ ). Have students
read the sample word. Discuss the power bar. Point out that the power bar
does not stretch all the way across the card. This means there are some
other spellings for this sound students will study later. Explain these spellings
are shown in the Vowel Code Flip Book but will not appear in the Readers
until students have been introduced to them. Add the Spelling Card to **Vowel**
**Code Flip Book page 17** .


 - Ask students to turn to **Individual Code Chart page 9** . Have them outline
the card in green.


~~**SPELLING TREE (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Show students the Spelling Tree and explain you are going to use them to
help them keep track of the spellings for the /aw/ sound.


 - Shuffle the leaves you prepared in advance, and then show each leaf.


 - Ask a student to read the leaf and then place it on the correct branch of the tree.

  - Have students read “The Dispute” in pairs. Tell students to play close
attention to how Jo feels in the story.


**Reading**

  - After students have finished reading “The Dispute” with their partners, lead
students in the following activities:


    - ask text-dependent questions that require students to draw on evidence
from the text;


    - identify and discuss general academic (Tier 2) vocabulary;


    - discuss sections of the text that might pose difficulty due to complex syntax,
dense information, or challenging transitions or that require inferences; and


    - engage students in a culminating writing activity completed
independently, where they write a five-sentence profile on a character
from the story.


Observation: Discussion Questions

 - Make one copy of the Moon Shot **game board** ( **Activity Page TR 20.2** ) for
each pair of students.


 - Copy and cut out one set of **Oh No! cards** ( **Activity Page TR 20.3** ) and one
set of **Good to Go! cards** ( **Activity Page TR 20.4** ).


 - Provide some **small tokens** as playing pieces.


 - Students take turns drawing word cards. If a student reads the word
correctly, he or she can draw a Good to Go! card and follow the directions on
the card. If a student does not read the word correctly, he or she will draw a
card from the Oh No! pile and follow the directions on that card.


 - The first student to make it to the moon is the winner.


~~**MORE HELP WITH PREFIXES**~~


 - To provide more practice for students in decoding, spelling, and using words
with the prefix _un–_, have them complete the following activity. Remind
students that we can decode, or read, words with prefixes by segmenting and
blending the sounds and using the syllable chunking method.


 - Explain that prefixes are word parts added to the beginning of a base word to
change the meaning of the word. Each of these prefixes is one syllable.


 - Display some of the following words.


Foundational Skills 3


    - unwind, undo, unable, unhappy, unlucky, unusual, untie, uncertain, untrue,
unwell, unfinished, unbroken, unafraid, unreal


  - Point to untie.


  - Say, “I see the prefix _un–_ /un/. I am going to segment the rest of the word:
/t/ /ie/. Now I can blend the entire word: un•tie.”


  - Pause between the syllables. Underline the _un–_ in _untie_ .


  - Say, “Un•tie. There are two syllables. The prefix _un–_ is one of the syllables.


  - Next, explain to students that prefixes change the meaning of the word.
Forexample, _tie_ becomes _untie_ when we add the prefix _un–_, which means
“not.” _Untie_ means “not tie” or “undo a tie.” Explain that students can spell
other new words by adding prefixes to the base words.


  - Say, “For words with prefixes, the spelling of the base word does not change
when the prefix is added.”


  - For practice, have small groups use their own paper to create and identify
the meaning of words with the prefix _un–_ . Provide base words and have them
add prefixes. Have volunteers share their words and their meanings. Offer
feedback as needed.


~~**PROGRESS MONITORING (OPTIONAL)**~~

**Primary Focus:** Students will decode, spell, and use words with the prefix _un–_ .

~~**TEKS 2.2.B.vi; TEKS 2.2.C.vi; TEKS 2.3.C**~~


Students will read one- and two-syllable words with the sound/spellings /aw/ >
‘au’, ‘augh’, and ‘aw’ and will answer written yes/no questions featuring words with
these features. ~~**[TEKS 2.2.B.iii; TEKS 2.2.B.v ]**~~


~~**DECODE, SPELL, AND USE WORDS WITH PREFIXES (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that we can decode, or read, words with prefixes by segmenting
and blending the sounds and using the syllable chunking method.


  - Explain to them that prefixes are word parts added to the beginning of a base
word to change the meaning of the word. Some prefixes include _un–, dis–,_
_in–, re–, pre, mis–, non–,_ and _ex–_ . Each of these prefixes is one syllable.


  - Say, “Let’s focus on the prefix _un–_ first.”


  - Display some of the following words: _unwind, undo, unable, unhappy, unlucky,_
_unusual, untie, uncertain, untrue, unwell, unfinished, unbroken, unafraid,_
_unreal._


  - Point to _unhappy_ .


  - Say, “I see the prefix _un–_ /un/. I am going to segment the rest of the word:
/h/ /a/ /p/ /ee/. Now I can blend the entire word: un•happy.”


  - Pause between the syllables. Underline the prefix _un–_ in _unhappy_ .


  - Say, “Un•happy. There are two syllables. The prefix _un–_ is one of the
syllables.”


  - Say the word again, clapping if needed to highlight the syllables. Repeat the
routine as needed with other words from the list.


  - Next, explain to students that prefixes change the meaning of the word. For
example, _happy_ becomes _unhappy_ when we add the prefix _un–_, which means
“not.” _Unhappy_ means “not happy.” Explain that students can spell other new
words by adding prefixes to the base words. Say, “For words with prefixes, the
spelling of the base word does not change when the prefix is added.”


**TEKS 2.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (vi) decoding words with prefixes, including un-, re-, and dis-,
and inflectional endings, including -s, -es, -ed, -ing, -er, and -est; (iii) decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open
syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables;
(v) decoding words using knowledge of syllable division patterns such as VCCV, VCV, and VCCCV; **TEKS 2.2.C.vi** Demonstrate
and apply spelling knowledge by spelling words with prefixes, including un-, re-, and dis-, and inflectional endings, including -s,
-es, -ed, -ing, -er, and -est; **TEKS 2.3.C** Identify the meaning of and use words with affixes un-, re-, -ly, -er, and -est (comparative and superlative), and -ion/tion/sion.

Foundational Skills 3


 - Explain that when students come across a word with a prefix while reading,
breaking the word into its parts (prefix and base word), can help them
understand what the word means.


 - Point to the word _untrue_ on the board.


 - Say, “Let’s identify the meaning of this word by breaking it into its parts. I’m
going to draw a line between the prefix and the base word. Where should I
draw the line?” ( _after_ the prefix _un–_ ).


 - Ask, “What is the base word?” ( _true_ ). “What does the word _true_ mean?”
( _something that is a fact_ )


 - Say, “If we add the prefix _un–_ at the beginning of true, how does the meaning
of the word change?” ( _It means not a fact_ )


 - For practice, have small groups use their own paper to create and identify
the meaning of words with the prefix _un–_ . Provide base words and have them
add prefixes. Have volunteers share their words and their meanings. Offer
feedback as needed.


~~**REVIEW /AW/ › ‘AW’, ‘AU’, AND ‘AUGH’ (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Review the three spellings of /aw/ by having students read the words on the
Spelling Tree as you point to them.


 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 21.1.


 - Complete the first one or two questions together.


 - Have students complete the rest of the activity page independently,

Activity Page 21.2




  - Direct students’ attention to The Writing Process graphic you prepared in
advance. Remind them of previous writing experiences from Unit 2. Tell them
that today they will begin familiarizing themselves with another genre of
writing—the personal narrative. Explain that a personal narrative is a story
that describes something that really happened to the author. The author’s
purpose for writing a personal narrative is to share an experience.


  - Review the terms _fiction_ and _nonfiction_ . Ask students how nonfiction is
different from fiction. _(Nonfiction tells about something that really happened._
_It is not a made-up or imaginary story.)_


  - Ask students whether a personal narrative would be fiction or nonfiction. (If
needed, prompt students to identify that personal narratives are nonfiction
because they are about something that really happened.)


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 21.2. Explain that this is a personal
narrative written by a student not much older than they are.


  - Read the narrative aloud while students follow along.


**Note:** The purpose of reading “The Big Storm” is to provide students with an
example of a personal narrative.


  - After you finish reading “The Big Storm,” explain that even though the
personal narrative is nonfiction, it contains many of the same elements as a
fictional story. It has a title; it has a setting (the event described happened in
a particular place and at a certain time); it has characters who do things (one
of whom is the author, or narrator, who is sharing the experience); and it has
a plot, with a beginning, middle, and end. Ask students to describe the major
plot elements of “The Big Storm,” including the main events and the conflict.

the last page of their Activity Book where the same chart is included. Explain
that good stories answer these five “W” questions: _Who? What? When?_
_Where? Why?_



)



**Digital Component 21.2**














 - Take a few moments to explain each of the five “W” questions:


   - **Who?** Who are the characters in the story?


   - **What?** What is the plot of the story? (the beginning, middle, and end)


   - **When?** When did the story take place? (e.g., early morning, during the
winter, last year, or in 2016) (thus identifies the setting)


   - **Where?** Where does the story take place? (this further identifies the
setting)


   - **Why?** Why did the main character do whatever it was that he or she did?


 - Tell students these are good questions to ask themselves as they are
planning and drafting a personal narrative or any other story.


**Elements of a Personal Narrative**



)



**Digital Component 21.3**




  - Display the blank planning template you prepared in advance. Remind students
this is the same page they used when discussing elements of fiction and planning
fictional stories. Explain they are going to use it to learn about the elements of a
personal narrative by using this template to analyze “The Big Storm.”


Lesson 21 Writing: Elements of a Personal Narrative
**281**


Activity Pages
21.3, 21.4




 - Work with students to complete the template for “The Big Storm.” When
discussing characters, be sure to point out that one of the main characters in
a personal narrative is always the narrator.


 - Explain that the narrator is the person who tells the story. Tell students that the
narrator is the “I” character in the personal narrative. (In this narrative, we do
not know the narrator’s name, or even whether the narrator is a boy or a girl.)


 - When you have completed the template as a group, go back to see if you
have identified the elements of the story that answer each of the five “W”
questions (Who? What? When? Where? Why?).


~~**WRAP-UP (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students take out Activity Pages 21.3 and 21.4.


 - Tell students to read the second personal narrative “Cupcakes with Mom” with a
partner. When they are finished reading, they should complete Activity Page 21.4.


 - You may want to leave the completed template and the Five Ws graphic on
display for students to reference while they are working.


 - Encourage students to bring home Activity Pages 21.3 and 21.4 to complete
at home if they do not finish in class.

  - Print uppercase ‘B’ and ‘H” on the board. Then slowly write each letter in
cursive underneath its printed counterpart.


**TEKS 2.2.E** Develop handwriting by accurately forming all cursive letters using appropriate strokes when connecting letters.


Foundational Skills 3


- Tell students that these two uppercase letters are part of a group called the
Slim Sevens because the first step in forming each of them is writing a slim
number seven.


- Write each letter again on the board, emphasizing the seven that starts each
letter. Have students come up to the board and circle the 7s in each letter.


- Model writing the Slim Seven Letters ‘B’ and ‘H’ in cursive again, one at a
time, on the board or using a projector that permits students to see your
hand movements.


  - If possible, project Digital Component 21.4 to model writing the letters.


- Tell students that like the lowercase letters, most of the uppercase letters
also connect to the letters that follow them.

~~**MORE HELP WITH TRICKY WORDS**~~


**Tricky Word Baseball**

 - Make one copy and cut out the word cards ( **Activity Page TR 1.2** ) with Tricky
Words or use the index cards you prepared for Lesson 1.


 - Draw a baseball diamond on the board/chart paper or use **Digital**
**Component 1.1** .


 - Divide students into two teams. Give each team a **token or playing piece** .


 - Have one team at a time line up. Each team takes a turn “at bat” as follows:


   - Pick a card from the pile and ask the first person on the team to read it.
If the word is read correctly, draw a line from home plate to first base,
signifying a “hit.” This player should go to the back of his or her team’s
line, while the next player comes forward to read the next card. If he or
she reads the word correctly, draw a line from first to second base. Play
continues in this way, so that each time a player reads a word correctly a
line is drawn to the next base. If the fourth player reads the word correctly,
draw a line from third base to home plate and mark “1 run” for this team.
Play continues by the members of this team so long as no words are
misread. When a word is misread, the next team takes its turn at bat.


   - Just as in the actual game of baseball, any players “left on base” when a
word is misread do not count or add to the score.


**Crazy Eights**

 - Create a deck of word cards by making a copy of **Activity Pages TR 2.2,**
**TR 8.3, TR 11.2, TR 12.1, TR 13.1, TR 20.1** .


 - You may also wish to include _skip_, _add_, _draw 1_, _draw 2_, _draw 3_, and
_reverse_ cards.


 - Follow the procedure in Lesson 16.


**Syllable Division Patterns**

 - Point out that students can use what they know about syllable types, such as
VCV and VCCV, and chunking to read and spell these words.


 - Write faucet, exhaust, and _applaud_ on the board.


 - Say, “In _faucet_, I see two vowel sounds (/aw/ and /e/) on either side of one
consonant.”


 - Say, “When only one consonant comes between two vowels, I divide after the
first vowel sound. So I will divide the word like this _fau•cet._ ”


Foundational Skills 3


  - Point to _exhaust_ .


  - Say, “In this word, I see two vowels on either side of two consonants.”


  - Underline the vowels.


  - Say, “When two consonants come between two vowels, I divide the word
between the consonants: _ex•haust_ .”


  - Point to _applaud_ .


  - Say, “In this word, I see two vowels on either side of three consonants.”


  - Underline the vowels.


  - Say, “When three consonants come between two vowels, I divide either
before or after the two consonants, depending on the consonants. In this
case, ‘p’ and ‘p’ make the /p/ sound, so I’ll keep them together: _app•laud._ ”

Say, “I see the prefix _un–_ /un/. I am going to segment the rest of the word:
/ae/ /b/ /le/. Now I can blend the entire word: un•able.”




- Say the word again, clapping if needed to highlight the syllables. Repeat the
routine as needed with other words from the list.


- Next, explain to students that prefixes change the meaning of the word. For
example, able becomes unable when we add the prefix _un–_, which means
“not.” _Unable_ means “not able.”


- Say, “For words with prefixes, the spelling of the base word does not change
when the prefix is added.”


- For practice, have small groups use their own paper to practice creating and
identifying the meaning of words with the prefix _un–_ . Provide base words
and have them add prefixes. Have volunteers share their words and their
meanings. Offer feedback as needed.



**Lesson 22: Plan and Draft a Personal Narrative**

Writing



30M



**Primary Focus:** Students will use a planning template and the Five Ws graphic to plan a
personal narrative as a class and will orally provide ideas to transform the information
in the chart into complete sentences. ~~**TEKS 2.11.A; TEKS 2.11.B.ii; TEKS 2.12.A**~~


~~**PLAN A PERSONAL NARRATIVE (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students they have been learning about the elements of a personal
narrative and they recently looked at one or two personal narratives written
by students.


  - Ask students how a personal narrative is like a fictional story. _(Both have the_
_same elements: title, setting, characters, plot.)_


  - Ask students how a personal narrative differs from a fictional story. _(The_
_personal narrative describes something that really happened, and the author_
_or narrator is one of the characters.)_


  - Tell students that today you will help them plan a personal narrative.


  - Remind students the first step in the writing process is planning.


**TEKS 2.11.A** Plan a first draft by generating ideas for writing such as drawing and brainstorming; **TEKS 2.11.B.ii** Develop
drafts into a focused piece of writing by developing an idea with specific and relevant details; **TEKS 2.12.A** Compose literary
texts, including personal narratives and poetry.

) **Digital Component 21.3**


 - Point to the display copy of the planning template and explain that they will
use this template—familiar to them from their work on fictional stories—to
plan their personal narrative.


 - Select an event all students in the class participated in recently (e.g., a field
trip, a classroom visit, a celebration, a performance).


 - Students should follow along and complete Activity Page 22.2.


 - Remind students of the shared event and review what happened during the
event, asking students to talk about significant details they remember.


 - Explain that the class experienced this event as a group, so it would be
possible to write about it as a group, saying what we did and how it made us
feel. However, this is not the way a personal narrative is usually written.


 - Explain a personal narrative is usually written with an “I” character as the
narrator, with the narrator describing what he or she did.


 - Explain you would like the class to write a personal narrative about something
they all experienced but using the voice of one member of the class.


 - Choose a student volunteer to be the “I” character, or narrator. Explain that
you will be asking this person to share his or her experience, while asking
the other members of the class to add details and expand on the narrator’s
recollections. The end result will be a narrative of the event as experienced
by this student but with contributions from other members of the class who
were also there.


 - Ask the narrator if he or she can think of a good title for the personal narrative
the class will be planning. Explain the title should give the reader a sense of
what the main event was. (If the narrator has trouble thinking of a title, ask the
class. If students have trouble thinking of a title at this point, you can return to
this section of the page later, after planning the other parts of the narrative.)



)



**Digital Component 21.2**




- Ask the narrator and other students about the characters involved in the
narrative. Remind students that characters answer the “Who?” question on
the Five Ws graphic. One of them should be the student chosen to be the “I”
character or narrator.


- Ask the narrator and/or the other students about the setting. Remind
students to ask the following “W” questions: “Where did the event take
place?” When did it take place?


Foundational Skills 3


 - Ask the narrator to answer the “W” question: “What happened?” Work with
the class to add details and divide the events into a beginning, middle, and
end. You can write complete sentences or just notes.


 - Be sure to consult frequently with the student chosen to be the “I” character.
Because it is a personal narrative, the notes you jot down on the planning
sheet should reflect his or her experience of the event. Remind students to
ask “Why?” from the Five Ws graphic to refine the character’s experience.


 - When you are finished, direct students’ attention to the Five Ws graphic.
Did the class answer all of the questions as they planned the writing: Who?
What? When? Where? Why?


 - Tell students they have completed the planning stage. The class will now
move to the next stage. In the drafting stage, the class will write a draft of the
personal narrative using the planning outline they just made.


~~**DRAFT A PERSONAL NARRATIVE (15 MIN.)**~~

If you do not have a shared
experience to write about,
you may use the story in
Teacher Resources. Tell
students this narrative
was written by Mr. Mowse,
the class friend.

**Digital Components 21.1**




  - Point to The Writing Process graphic and remind students of the three steps
in the writing process: plan, draft, edit.


  - Tell students they have planned the personal narrative and the next step is to
write a first draft of it. They will do this as a class, with the narrator offering
initial ideas for sentences and the class helping to develop these ideas and
add relevant details, with you serving as scribe.


  - Tell students the first thing they need to write on the draft is the title. Point
to the title on the planning template and write the same title at the top of a
blank piece of chart paper.


  - Tell students the first sentence of the personal narrative should introduce
the narrator and other important characters and also identify the setting
(specifying where and when the event took place).


  - Work with the narrator and other students to come up with a good
introduction sentence for the personal narrative. Encourage the narrator to
develop an initial sentence. If he or she needs help, let the other members
of the class make suggestions. Before transcribing the sentence, encourage
students to expand and elaborate on the initial sentence by asking probing
questions to elicit more details and descriptive words.


  - Write the sentence below the title on the chart paper, using every other line.
(This leaves you space to add words or sentences later.) Be sure to indent
the sentence.


Lesson 22 Writing: Plan and Draft a Personal Narrative
**293**


Point out that the sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a
punctuation mark.



**294**




  - Work with the narrator and the other students to write first the beginning,
then the middle, and finally the end of the personal narrative, asking
students—and especially the “I” character—to help you transform the notes
on the planning template into complete sentences.


  - Encourage students to orally state their ideas in complete sentences. Prior to
any transcription, help students expand and elaborate their oral sentences
by asking probing questions to elicit more details and descriptive words.
Encourage them to think in terms of each of the five senses (e.g., What did
the place we visited look like? What did it smell like? What sounds did we
hear?). As you work, you may use some words containing spellings students
have not been taught. There is no need to explain every unfamiliar spelling.
However, you may wish to draw attention to a few of them, especially if they
are in words likely to occur several times in the narrative.


  - Remind students that when we write more than a few sentences, we
divide the writing into sections called paragraphs. Remind them that each
paragraph is indented. Discuss how the sentences they are writing might
be divided into paragraphs. (One obvious method would be to have a
“beginning” paragraph, a “middle” paragraph, and an “end” paragraph to
match the three sections on the planner.)


  - Tell students the last sentence of the narrative should bring the writing to a
conclusion and let the reader know the narrative is finished.


  - Work with the narrator and other students to come up with a good
concluding sentence for the narrative. You may also wish to have them end
with the words, “The End.” Write the concluding sentence on the chart paper.


  - Read the draft to the class or have students read it out loud.

~~**DECODE, SPELL, AND USE WORDS WITH PREFIXES (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students that in the previous lesson they learned to decode words
with prefixes by segmenting and blending the sounds and using the syllable
chunking method.


 - Remind them that prefixes are word parts added to the beginning of a base
word to change the meaning of the word.


 - Say, “Let’s focus again on the prefix _un–._ ”


 - Write the word _unlucky_ on the board/chart paper.


 - Say, “I see the prefix _un–_ /un/. I am going to segment the rest of the word: /l/
/u/ /k/ /ee/. Now I can blend the entire word: un•lucky.”


 - Say the word again, clapping if needed to highlight the syllables. Repeat the
routine as needed with other words from the list.


 - Next, explain to students that prefixes change the meaning of the word. For
example, _lucky_ becomes _unlucky_ when we add the prefix _un–_, which means
“not.” _Unlucky_ means “not lucky.”


 - Remind students that the spelling of the base word does not change when
the prefix is added.

**Lesson 24: Editing a Personal Narrative**

Writing



50M



**Primary Focus:** Students will use an editing checklist to review their personal
narratives, working in pairs to edit and revise their own as well as a peer’s writing.


~~**TEKS 2.11.D.iv; TEKS 2.11.D.v; TEKS 2.11.D.ix; TEKS 2.11.D.x; TEKS 2.11.D.xi; TEKS 2.12.A**~~


~~**EDIT AND REVISE A PERSONAL NARRATIVE (50 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students today they will edit their drafts with partners. Depending on how
you have set up partners, you might want to talk about working as a partner
in this writing assignment. It is not the same as being a partner when reading
aloud. Remind students of good partner manners when editing (e.g., make
suggestions, not demands; be careful not to hurt the other person’s feelings;
accept feedback politely).


  - Before sending students to work as partners, take a few minutes to review
the editing checklist (Activity Page 24.1) as a class. Remind students that
when they are editor, they should edit any errors in capitalization, end
punctuation, and spelling. They should also make sure the draft they are
reading includes adverbs or other words that convey time and place (the
setting), as well as adjectives and other “sense” words to describe how things
look, feel, taste, sound, and smell.


  - When students check for correct use of pronoun cases (subjective, objective,
and possessive), reinforce how to edit drafts for pronouns. Use the chart to
explain the differences between them and provide examples.

**Expanding**

**and Enriching Ideas**


**Beginning**
Working with individuals,
ask students questions
about their stories
to have them dictate
sentences to expand their
personal narratives.


**Intermediate**
Working with individuals,
ask students questions to
have them write additional
sentences to expand their
personal narratives.


**Advanced/Advanced High**
Working with individuals,
ask questions to guide
students in locating
areas where they can
improve their personal
narratives with additional
information. Have
students write new
sentences and then
explain how this enhances
their stories.

and adverbs that convey place; (ix) capitalization of months, days of the week, and the salutation and conclusion of a letter;
(x) end punctuation, apostrophes in contractions, and commas with items in a series and in dates; (xi) correct spelling of words with
grade-appropriate orthographic patterns and rules and high-frequency words; **TEKS 2.12.A** Compose literary texts, including personal
narratives and poetry.

Tell students each partner will have a turn to edit their work and a turn to be
the editor.



Support


Provide students with
examples of appropriate
editing comments. Ask
students to share possible
ways to give positive
feedback to partners using
Mr. Mowse’s personal
narrative from
Lesson 23.


Activity Page 24.2


**308**




  - Ask students to go to their partners. Once students are settled, ask them to
decide which person will be the editor first and who will read first.


  - Tell students to read through their work sentence by sentence and then
consult with their editor on each sentence. The editor will use the editing
checklist to help the reading partner.


  - Tell students that when one partner is completely finished, they should
switch roles for the other partner’s work.


  - Circulate throughout the room assisting where necessary. Some student pairs
may get to the rewriting today. Others may continue to do rewrites throughout
the next few days of assessment and during the Pausing Point. ~~**TEKS 2.11.D**~~


Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** Ask students to think about the characters, setting, and plot

in their personal narratives. Have students turn to their partners; the first partner

should list the characters and setting of his or her personal narrative. The other

partner should share the plot of his or her personal narrative. If there is enough time

the roles should be switched and pairs may share their answers with the class.

Pausing Point


This is the end of Unit 3. If it appears that students are having difficulty with
the material from Unit 3, pause here and spend up to five days providing
targeted remediation in the specific areas of weakness. Additionally, you may
make arrangements to work with identified struggling students individually
or in small groups in order to address specific areas of weakness.


You might pause if several students are having trouble reading words
containing the spelling alternatives taught; however, there is no need to
pause if they do not reliably use the correct spelling alternative when writing.
Writing correct spelling alternatives will come gradually with time and
repeated exposure to printed materials.

~~**SPELLING ALTERNATIVES**~~


**Rhyming Words**

  - Support students’ understanding of producing a series of rhyming words by
asking them to identify the first sound and the ending sound of a word, such
as _caught_ .


  - Invite students to close their eyes and repeat the word. Isolate the beginning
sound of the word if needed and repeat; say /c/ /aw/ /t/.


  - Tell students that to find a rhyming word(s), we need to change the first
sound and keep the ending sound (e.g., _taught, ought_ ).


  - Direct students to the alphabet posted in the classroom to use as a reference
for beginning sounds.


  - Repeat this process with the words _taste, coast, lie_ . ~~**[TEKS 2.2.A.i ]**~~


**Vowel Code Flip Book Review**

  - Point to single-letter spellings for vowel sounds and ask students to say the
sounds. Then point to digraph spellings for vowel sounds, then separated
digraph spellings for vowel sounds, then spellings consisting of more than
two letters for vowel sounds (‘augh’).


  - You may wish to review consonant spellings as well.


**Teacher Chaining**

  - Write _pain_ on the board/chart paper.


  - Ask a student to read the word, first in a segmented fashion, and then as
blended word.


  - Add ‘t’ to create _paint_ .


  - As you make this change, say to students, “If that is _pain_, what is this?”


  - Continue this process with the remaining words.

**Teacher Chaining with Two-Syllable Words**

 - Write the word _onto_ on the board/chart paper.


 - Ask students to read the word.


 - Once students have read the word correctly, tell them you are going to
change **one syllable** to make a new word.


 - Remove _on_ and add _in_ to make _into_ .


 - As you make this change, say to students, “If that is _onto_, what is this?”


 - Continue this process with the remaining words.

column according to which spelling is used.


  - Have students copy each word next to (or below) the pasted word.


  - Have students pick more words and add them to the sorting space.


  - If students need additional help, you could underline the target spelling in
each word.


  - Alternately, have students use highlighters to mark the letters for the sound
in each word on their sorting space.

**Spelling Alternatives Board Game**

 - Create a game board using any of the templates provided at the end of the
Pausing Point.


 - Write a decodable /ae/ word on each square, making sure to include several
examples of each of the spelling patterns taught.


 - Give each student a scorecard listing the spellings for /ae/ they have learned
with spaces to collect a word exemplifying each spelling.


 - Teach students to play the game by rolling a die (or spinning a spinner) and
moving their game piece the correct number of spaces.


 - When students land on a space, they should read the word and copy it onto
their spelling scorecard according to the spelling used for the /ae/ sound. For
example, the word _cake_ would be copied into the space for ‘a_e’ words.


 - The first student to get one example of each spelling pattern wins.


 - This game could be played with any number of sounds learned.


 - Alternately, sounds could be combined on the boards as well.

At a later time today, you may find it helpful to use the template provided at the end of this lesson to
analyze students’ mistakes. The directions below will help you to understand any new or persistent
patterns among individual students.


  - Write students’ names in the column provided.


  - Place an X in the column of any word students did not spell correctly.


  - Students missing more than one for items 1–3 may need help with ‘er’; students missing more than
one for items 4–6 may need help with ‘or’; students missing more than one for items 7–9 may need
help with ‘ar’. The Pausing Point from Unit 2 provides practice for r-controlled vowels.


  - If students misspelled the words _sister_ and _letter_, they may be having difficulty with medial
vowel sounds.


  - If students miss the – _ed_ for the word _started_, they might be having difficulty with the – _ed_ suffix.
Unit 2 covered the – _ed_ suffix.


  - If students missed the Tricky Word, look back on previous spelling assessments and classroom
work Are Tricky Words consistently an area of weakness? If so, the Pausing Points in Units 1 and 2
provide resources.


  - If students misspelled several of the two-syllable words ( _sister, letter, expert, backyard_ ), they may
benefit from targeted practice in which they first break multi-syllable words into chunks, drawing a
line for each syllable, and then go back to spell the word syllable by syllable.

~~**LESSON 20: SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


     - These words present a particular challenge for analysis due to the twofold nature of the assessment.
When analyzing students’ results this time, you need to look at two things: First, did the student
write the correct word for the concept (antonym or synonym)? Second, did the student spell the
word correctly?


     - If students made mistakes on the concept of synonyms or antonyms, there is ample practice
provided in the Pausing Point pages to assist you in planning lessons.

~~**OPTIONAL FLUENCY ASSESSMENT**~~

The Slug Trainer


7
Sunday I went to a slug race.


18
My pal was Paul Gumfish. Paul is ten. He keeps slugs

31 as pets. He has sixteen slugs. Paul is a slug trainer. He has

42 been training slugs since he was nine. In August one of his


52
slugs took the top prize in a slug race.


55
“Paul,” I said.


60
“Call me Coach,” Paul said.


67
“Okay, Coach. Which slug is the fastest?”


74
Paul pointed to his prize-winning slug.

81 “His name is King David,” Paul said.

88 “Why is he so fast?” I asked.

97 Paul said, “He just is. Want to hold him?”

101 “No thanks,” I said.

114 Next Paul took out a race track. It was a box with two


127
plastic pipes sticking out of it. Paul said that the box is like


141
a slug hotel. It’s a place for the slugs to hang out until it


154
is time to race. When the gates of the box are opened, the


165
slugs make their way down the pipes. They race side by


173
side until they get to the finish line.


Foundational Skills 3
**366**


184
Paul set two slugs in the box. He sprayed water on

196
them to keep them moist. Then he set some slug food at


201
the end of the pipes.


210
Paul opened the gates and shouted, “Go, slugs, go!”


219
Then we watched and waited. After five minutes the

232
two slugs had made their way out of the box and into the

233
pipes.


239
“Is that King David?” I asked.


241
Paul nodded.


247
“He’s the fast one?” I asked.


256
“He starts by just creeping along but finishes fast,”



Paul said.



258



268
The slugs inched their way down the track. They were


279
just creeping along! I sat with Paul for fifteen minutes. At


290
last King David made it to the end of the pipe.


297
“King David is the winner!” said Paul.

**Sound Quest /ue/**

Last week, my sister and I argued about whether or
not unicorns exist. I tried to tell my sister that unicorns
are not real, but she did not agree with me. She said
that they are just as real as humans. She said that she’s
seen one. If you ask me, I think she has confused a
horse or a mule with a unicorn. We continued our
dispute, but then I realized that arguing with her is
useless. I will never be able to get her to understand
that unicorns don’t exist. Besides, it’s sort of cute that
she thinks unicorns are real.

**Grade 2 Foundational Skills 3|**
Appendix: Using
Chunking to Decode
Multisyllable Words


Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught in this program will enable students to
read one-syllable words with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences
is no guarantee that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllable words. To
this end, most students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk and
read parts of words—syllables—as a way to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can then
be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated and students are expected
to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, this program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the easiest
two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is already a
familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In addition, each
syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing_, _hunt·er_, _bust·ed_ ). The
dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain double-letter
spellings for consonants, in this program, the divider is typically placed after the double-letter
spelling rather than between the two consonants (e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers familiar
with other ways to chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is done, however,
because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single-spelling units since Kindergarten
(‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.). This program strives to be consistent in representing these
spellings in the way that the students have been taught to process them (e.g., as whole entities
for a sound). (Ultimately, as students become more proficient at decoding and chunking syllables
through subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually chunk and decode
these words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding these two-syllable
words consisting of root words and suffixes relatively easy.


Foundational Skills 3


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable words.
To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


  - **Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound (e.g.,**
**/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/):** _let,_ _pad,_ _rod,_ _tin,_ _fun,_ _pic·nic,_ _un·til_


  - **Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /**
**ie/, /oe/, /ue/):** _cake,_ _home,_ _like,_ _mule,_ _Pete, mis·take, stam·pede_


  - **Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint,_ _speak,_ _proud,_ _play, dis·may, be·low,_ _coun·sel_


  - **R-Controlled Syllables:** _art, curb, girl, fort, clerk, tur·nip, ar·tist, fe·ver_


  - **Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /ie/,**
**/oe/, /ue/):** _go, me, hi, a·pron, fi·nal, com·pre·hend_


  - **Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple, puz·zle, raf·fe, ca·ble, ri·fe_


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


  - **Schwa Syllables:** _ben·e·fit, ap·pe·tite, a·bout, hos·pit·al, e·mo·tion_


**Note:** The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately because
of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


**To be clear, in order to decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these**
**names. The names of the syllable types are provided here only to establish a common**
**vocabulary for teachers as they use the materials.** What is necessary, however, for students to
become fluent readers of longer words in increasingly complex text is that they be able to visually
parse certain spelling patterns as syllable chunks so they can quickly and easily decode each
syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in Kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


  - When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.


_ad · mit_ _nap · kin_ _trum · pet_


Appendix
**487**


**488**




 - For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed after the
double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is one because the
double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units in this program since Kindergarten
(‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).


_traff · ic_ _muff · in_ _happ · en_


 - When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.


_mon · ster_ _con · tract_ _pil · grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read
the first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model
for students how to blend the two syllables aloud:


In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the magic
‘E’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


 - Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for closed
syllables:


_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


In Grade 2, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to use
a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying each
possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


Foundational Skills 3


  - When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:


_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_


However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There is
no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be flexible
and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to determine
whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. In order to recognize
whether a word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has
heard before (i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent
an additional challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a
second language.


  - If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:


_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is fairly straightforward.


Appendix
**489**


**490**




 - When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings in
the words


_ban · gle_ _twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_


In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings represent
the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a combination of stressed
and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed or weakly stressed, its
vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that linguists call a schwa.
This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’ and
‘tion’. Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite challenging for many
students.


 - Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the
schwa sound has a particular spelling:


_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is actually a schwa syllable, but it is identified
separately because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


 - Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables accordingly
throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _tri·cycle_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness_ _help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten—Grade
3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.
