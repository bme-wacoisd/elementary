**Consonant Code Flip Book**


In Grade 2, the code information is presented to students through
two instructional tools: (1) Code Flip Books (one for consonants
and one for vowels), used for group instruction and classroom
display; and (2) Individual Code Charts, one per student. The Code
Flip Books are used with a set of Spelling Cards. The Spelling
Cards are to be affixed to the appropriate Code Flip Book pages
as sounds and spellings are reviewed and taught. The Code Flip
Books show (in grey print) the spellings for all sounds taught in
Grade 2. As you review the sounds and introduce new sounds, you
will be asked to place the Spelling Card on the appropriate Code
Flip Book page.


Each Spelling Card is printed front and back. One
side of the card shows the sound.







The other side of the card shows three things:

The top of this side of the card shows the spelling.
The bottom shows a sample word containing the
spelling. In the middle is a power bar. The power bar
indicates how common this spelling is for the sound
it represents. A long power bar that stretches almost
across the card means that this is the main spelling
for the sound and there are very few words that have
this sound spelled any other way. A very short power
bar means the spelling is less common and occurs
in fewer English words.



Consonant sounds will always be written in red on the Spelling
Cards because when saying a consonant sound, parts of the
mouth touch or are closed, blocking or “stopping” some of the air.
