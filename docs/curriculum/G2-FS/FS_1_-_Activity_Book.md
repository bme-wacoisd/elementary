**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 1. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. The activity pages in this book
do not include written instructions for students because the instructions would have words that
are not decodable. Teachers will explain these activity pages to the students orally, using the
instructions in the Teacher Guide. The Activity Book is a student component, which means each
student should have an Activity Book.

**Kate Visits Do·ba**

I’m Kate Nez and last summ·er, when I was nine, my mom and dad
took me to vis·it my Do·ba. Do·ba is my mom’s mom. She is an art·ist
and she has a **cab·in** out in the Southwest.


At the start of my vis·it with Do·ba, I was sad. It seemed like it
would be a dull summ·er. But in the end, I had a lot of fun.


I was sitt·ing in the kitch·en, patt·ing the cat that was sitt·ing on
my lap, when Do·ba came in.


“I just spoke with Sa·ni,” she said. “He made us an **off·er** .”


“What sort of off·er?”


“He asked if we would like to camp with him and Gad.”


“Who is Gad?”


“Gad is a kid. He’s nine, like you. Sa·ni is his grand·dad.”


“What would we do?” I asked.


“Well, we would hike, look at rocks, cook lunch and dinn·er
out·side, look at the stars, and sleep in a tent.”


“Gee,” I said, “that sounds like fun! When can we start?”


“To·morr·ow morn·ing!” Do·ba said.

Dear Family Member,

**Take-Home**



It is exciting to start the school year—a warm welcome to you and your student!


The purpose of this letter is to tell you about the reading program your student will be
using this year. The program is an innovative set of instructional materials. If your student
attended our school in either Kindergarten or Grade 1, he or she probably used this
program for reading instruction in those grades.


The program consists of two types of instruction every day. The sixty-minute Knowledge
Strand builds general knowledge, vocabulary, and other language skills.


The Skills strand, also sixty minutes, uses a phonics-based approach to teach the
mechanics of reading and spelling. Students will also receive grammar and writing
instruction during this strand.


During the early weeks of school, we will review the skills taught in Grade 1. This review
period will also give us the opportunity to get to know your student better so we can
identify his or her particular areas of strength and weakness in reading and writing.
It is important that we determine exactly what level of instruction is most appropriate
for your student.


This week your student will bring home copies of a story we have read together in
class. We hope you will encourage your student to reread the stories aloud and discuss
them with you at home. However, if your student has difficulty reading the stories and
appears frustrated, please read the stories aloud to him or her. We will be observing and
assessing your student during these first few weeks to be sure that he or she is placed in
the appropriate level of instruction. Your student will use the instructional materials most
appropriate for his or her learning needs. You will soon begin to see more examples of
class work, as well as homework, on a regular basis.


It is important that parents become involved in the education of their student. If you
would like information on ways to help your student at home, please do not hesitate to
contact me. You will continue to receive periodic family-member letters that will give you
tips and activities to do with your student. I look forward to teaching your student this year
as we continue using this program in our Grade 2 classes.

**The Campsite**


Sa·ni came and picked us up in his truck. We drove for miles to
get to the **camp·site** .


“Do·ba,” I said, “what is this place?”


“Well,” said Do·ba, “take a look. See all the sand, rocks, and stones?
This land is not good for farming, but it’s good for hik·ing.”


“And it’s good land for camp·ing!” said Sa·ni .


When we got to the camp·site, we had to un·pack sleep·ing bags,
tents, lan·terns, match·es, and lots of food. We lugged it all to the
camp·site.


Sa·ni chose a spot to set up camp. Gad and I helped set up the tents.
It took us a long time.


For dinn·er we had
hot dogs. We stuck them
on sticks and held them
in the fire. My hot dog
got all black be·cause I
left it in there too long.
Gad gave me one of his.


That was when I
said to my·self, “Gad
is O.K.!”

**The Hike**


The next morn·ing, we went on a hike. Af·ter a bit, we stopped for
lunch.


When Gad fin·ished his lunch, he asked, “Can Kate and I look for
rocks by our·selves?”


Sa·ni said O.K.


“Kate,” Gad said to me, “bring your fork. We can use it to dig up
rocks.”


I grabbed my fork and we
went off to look for rocks.


Gad point·ed at a bump on
the side of a **cliff** and said, “Let’s
dig that rock out!”


The rock did not look all
that large. But when we start·ed
digg·ing, we soon saw that it was
larg·er than it had seemed.


Af·ter a bit, Gad said, “Gee!
It must be two feet long! We’ve
got to keep scratch·ing.”


We went on scratch·ing with
our forks.

“Let’s tug on it!” Gad said.


We grabbed it and gave a big tug.


It popped out. But so did a big cloud of sand and dust. Gad and I
fell down.


Once the dust and sand had drift·ed off, I saw Gad stand·ing there
with the thing in his hands.


“It’s not a rock!” he yelled. “It’s a **bone** !”


It was the bigg·est bone I had ev·er seen. It was three feet long!


Sa·ni and Do·ba came runn·ing. When she saw the bone, Do·ba
looked up·set.


“Are you OK?” I asked.


She did not say. “Will you tell me, Kate, where you found that
large bone?”


I point·ed to the spot where we found it.


“Good·ness!” she said. “It was in the cliff.”


“What is done is done,” said Sa·ni. “Let’s look at it.”


Sa·ni set the bone on the ground. Then he took a pic·ture of the
bone and said, “We need to get an **ex·pert** to look at this bone and
tell us what sort of bone it is.”

**The Bone Man**


The next morn·ing, Sa·ni said, “I just had a chat with a man from
West•ern State **Coll·ege** . His name is Ron Fitch and he is an ex·pert on
bones. He has writt·en lots of books. If we bring him the bone, he can
tell us what sort of bone it is.”


We got in·to the truck. Sa·ni
said that I was in charge of the
bone. I wrapped it up and set it
on my lap.


When we got to the
coll·ege, we gave the bone man
the bone. When he saw it, he
broke in·to a big grin.


The bone man bent down
and said, “I could be wrong,
but it looks like you’ve found
some·thing big here! I have to
do some tests, but I’ll bet this is
a bone of a **rap·tor** .”


“What’s a rap·tor?” I asked.


“Kate!” Gad said, “A rap·tor
is like the cool·est **rep·tile** of
all time!”

The next week, Do·ba said, “I just spoke with Ron Fitch, the bone
man. I’ve got three things to tell you. Two of them are good things
that you will like. One is a bad thing that you will not like.”


“Tell me one of the good things,” I said.


“Mis·ter Fitch got the tests back. The bone that you and Gad
found is a rap·tor bone!”


“Yipp·ee!” I shout·ed. “I am glad that is solved. Gad will be so
thrilled that he has a rap·tor bone!”


“Well,” said Do·ba, “that brings me to the bad thing.”


“The next thing is there is a law that says that you can’t dig up
bones and keep them for your·self,” Do·ba said. “We Na·va·jo say the
bone should have stayed in the ground. It be·longs to no one. But now
that it is out, Mis·ter Fitch and his hel·pers will keep it safe for us.”


“May I tell you the second good thing? They would like you and
Gad to vis·it them when they are digg·ing up the bones. And they
would like the two of you to pick out a name for the rap·tor that
you found.”


“So cool!” I said.

**The Big Dig**


When we went back to the cliff, the bone man was there with
some help·ers. They had **scraped** the side of the cliff to ex·pose a lot
of the rap·tor.


“So, will you dig out all of the bones here on **site** ?” asked Do·ba.


“No,” said the bone man. “The next step will be to cut this cliff
up in·to large blocks of rock. Then we will wrap the blocks up in
**plast·er** . The plast·er will keep the bones from crack·ing. Then we
will use a large **crane** to set the blocks on trucks. Then the trucks will
take them to my **lab** . Once the blocks are there, we will start digg·ing
the bones out of the blocks.”


“What sort of tools do
you use for that?” asked
Do·ba.


“We use tools a lot like
the ones den·tists use on
teeth—brush·es and sharp
picks.”


“Kate and I used forks!”
said Gad.


“How long will it take
to get all of the bones out
of the rocks?” Sa·ni asked.

“Well,” said the bone man. “We’ve got a lot to do. It will take

“Will you be fin·ished by the end of the summ·er?” I asked.


“No,” said the bone man. “You and Gad will have to vis·it next
summ·er and per·haps the summ·er af·ter that. Then we can catch up
on our digg·ing prog·ress!”


“So,” said the bone man, “have you kids picked out a name for
this rap·tor?”


“Yes, I’ve picked one,” I said.


All of the digg·ers stopped digg·ing and looked at me.

it on her arms and her legs. She rubbed it on her nose and her cheeks.
She even rubbed it on her elbows and her toes.


“David,” she said, “would you like some sunscreen?”


“No thanks,” said David. “I’ll be okay without it.” Then he ran off
to play soccer.


David played soccer. He tossed a Frisbee. He ran a relay race. He
rowed a boat. He swam. He splashed in the waves. He went diving for
shells. He made a scarf out of seaweed. Then he lay down and took a
nap.


All this time the sun was shining brightly. Rays of sunlight were
landing on David’s arms and legs.


At last the daylight faded. David was set to go home. But when he
got up, he felt some pain on his legs. He looked down. His body was
as red as a lobster. His thighs looked like two roasted hams. His toes
looked like ten bright red pigs running on the sand.

**Sink or Float**


It was the first Thursday of summer vacation. It was hot. Joey Jenkins and
his younger brother Pete were sitting by the pool trying to stay cool. Pete had
his ankles and toes in the water.


“Hey Pete,” Joey shouted at his little brother, “let’s play sink or float.”


“How do you play?” asked Pete.


“First I go and find something,” explained Joey. “Then I ask you if you
think it will sink or float. Then I throw it in the pool and we find out if you
were right or wrong.”


“Okay,” replied Pete.


Joey ran to the garage and got a brass key.


“That must be pretty heavy,” said Pete. “I say it’s going to sink for sure!”


Joey tossed the key in the pool. It sank
below the surface in an instant.


“Okay, little brother,” said Joey, “you won
that one. Do you want to play again?”


Pete nodded his head.


Joey sprinted up to the house and got an apple from the boys’ mom.


“I predict that will float,” said Pete.


Joey tossed the apple in the pool and, sure enough, it bobbed and floated
on top of the water.

Joey ran over to the woods and picked up an acorn that was lying beneath
a towering old oak tree.


“Gee,” said Pete. “That’s a tough one. An acorn might sink, but then
again, it might float.”


“Sink or float?” said Joey. “I need a decision now!”


“Um, I guess it will sink,” Pete said.


Joey tossed the acorn in the pool. It bobbed and floated on top of the
water right next to the apple.


“Ha, ha! You lose!” Joey cried.


Joey ran into the house and got a plastic model airplane he had built.


“Sink or float?” he asked.


“Sink!” said Pete.


Joey set the airplane ever so gently on the surface of the water. At first it
looked like the airplane was floating.


“Ha, ha!” said Joey. “It floats! You lose again!”


“Not so fast!” said Pete. He thumped the water with both of his feet and
made a gigantic wave. The wave went crashing over the airplane. The airplane
filled with water and began sinking.


“It sinks!” said Pete, smiling. “So I win!”


“No fair!” said Joey. “That’s cheating!”

Dear Family Member,


Each week, your student will receive a new list of spelling words. The purpose of having
weekly spelling words is to help students become strong spellers and allow them to
practice at home the skills learned during this program.


Your student will receive the spelling words at the beginning of the week and will be
assessed on the words at the end of the week. The spelling words come from stories your
student reads in class. By reading the stories and practicing the spelling words at home
each night, your student should be well prepared for the spelling test on Friday.


There are ten words each week. The words cover only the spellings that have been
reviewed and taught in class, meaning your student will only work with and be tested on
familiar spellings. Spelling word number 10 is a Tricky Word and is marked in a special way.
A Tricky Word does not follow the expected spelling rules. This means Tricky Words cannot
be reliably sounded out and spelled, so its spelling must be memorized. Tricky Words are
also taught and reviewed in class.


I encourage you to work with your student each night to review the spelling words for
5 _–_ 10 minutes. The activities can be fun and need to involve having your student write the
word. Here are a few activity ideas:


  - Say a sentence with the spelling word, but leave the spelling word out. For example,
you might say, “The took off with a bag of loot.” Your student should guess
the word _bandit_ and then write the word.


   - Create spelling word flash cards. After reading the word on a flash card, your
student can turn over the card and write the word from memory on the back.


  - Have a spelling bee at home, asking your student to both spell the words to you
orally and write them.


   - Ask your student to write each word in a short sentence, or write a story with
the words.


  - Act out or draw a picture of the words; have your student guess the word and then
write it down.


The spelling words for this week are on Activity Page 11.2. Again, please note word
number 10 is a Tricky Word, so we have marked it in a special way.


If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Family Member,


Once again this week, your student has a new list of spelling words. The purpose of
having weekly spelling words is to help students become strong spellers and allow them to
practice at home the skills learned during this program _._ Additionally, this helps students to
develop independence as they begin to take responsibility for their own learning.


Your student will receive the spelling words at the beginning of the week and will be
tested on the words at the end of the week. By practicing the spelling words at home each
night, your student should be well prepared for the spelling test.


I encourage you to work with your student each night 5 _–_ 10 minutes to review the
spelling words. If you would like to practice the way we take the test at school:


For each word, I read it once, say it in a sentence, and say the word again.
We go through the whole list in this way. Then, I go back through and call each
word one last time so the students can review them. I also call out a phrase. The
students do not know this phrase in advance. They write this phrase on the test.
Then, I ask students to correct their own paper as I demonstrate the correct
spelling for each word. I ask them to correct their paper by writing the correct
spelling above the word. It is okay for students to make mistakes; the important
thing is to learn from their mistakes.


The spelling words for this week are on Activity Page 16.3. Again, please note the word
_how,_ number 10, is a Tricky Word, so we have marked it in a special way.


I know you have busy lives and you must fit in homework wherever you can. Any practice
will help your student to become a better reader and speller. Your student will continue to
bring home stories that we have read in class later this week. We will continue this practice
throughout the year. Please have your student read the story to you and then talk about it
together. Remember this practice can take place anywhere.


As always, please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

**The Chips**


Once Mom left a big bag of chips on the top shelf in the kitchen.


“The cat will not get them up there,” she said.


But it was not long until the cat bandit was up to his tricks.


He got a log, a plank, and a big rock.


He set the rock on the bench.


He set the log on the rug next to the bench.


He set the plank on top of the log.


Then the bandit sat on one end of the plank.


He slid the rock off the bench.


The rock fell and landed on one end of the plank.


Smack!


The end of the plank the rock fell on went down fast.


But the end of the plank the cat bandit was sitting on popped up,
and the cat bandit popped up with it.


Whiz!


The cat bandit went zipping up.


The cat bandit did a flip and landed on top of the shelf.
