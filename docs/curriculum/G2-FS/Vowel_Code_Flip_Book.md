**Vowel Code Flip Book**


In Grade 2, the code information is presented to students through two instructional
tools: (1) Code Flip Books (one for consonants and one for vowels), used for group
instruction and classroom display; and (2) Individual Code Charts, one per student.
The Code Flip Books are used with a set of Spelling Cards that are to be affxed to
the appropriate Code Flip Book pages as sounds and spellings are reviewed and
taught. The Code Flip Books show (in grey print) the spellings for all sounds taught in
Grade 2. As you review the sounds and introduce new sounds in later Grade 2 units,
you will be asked to place the Spelling Card on the appropriate Code Flip Book page.


Each Spelling Card is printed front and back. One side of the card
shows the sound.







The other side of the card shows three things:


The top of this side of the card shows the spelling. The bottom
shows a sample word containing the spelling. In the middle is a
power bar. The power bar gives an indication of how common
this spelling is for the sound it represents. A long power bar that
stretches almost across the card means that this is the main
spelling for the sound and there are very few words that have this
sound spelled any other way. A very short power bar means that
the spelling is less common and occurs in fewer English words.



Also note vowel sounds will always be written in green on the Spelling Cards because
when saying a vowel sound, the mouth is wide open, letting the air “go.” The
r-controlled vowel sounds are written in a different color, blue, to show that they are a
combination of a vowel sound and a consonant sound.
