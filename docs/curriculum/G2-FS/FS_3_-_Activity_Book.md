**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 3. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. Some of the activity pages in this
book do not include written instructions for students because the instructions would have words
that are not decodable. Teachers will explain these activity pages to the students orally, using the
instructions in the Teacher Guide. The Activity Book is a student component, which means each
student should have an Activity Book.

Dear Family Member,

The spelling words for this week include “r-controlled vowels.” By itself, the letter ‘r’ is
a spelling for a consonant sound, but the sound /r/ can pair with certain vowel sounds,
creating unique vowel sounds like /er/, /ar/, and /or/. Please remember to practice the
spelling words for a short time (five to ten minutes) each night.


Today your student is also bringing home a story to read, “A Letter from the Publisher,”
and an accompanying activity page. This is the first story in the Unit 3 Reader, _Kids Excel_ .
Your student will read about kids excelling at all types of things, such as spelling, jumping
rope, and playing soccer. After reading “A Letter from the Publisher,” have your student
answer the story questions on the back of the activity page. Encourage your student to
look back at the story to find the answers.

**A Letter from the Publisher**


Kids,

My name is Mark Deeds,
and I have a fun job. I visit
with kids who _excel_ at what
they do.

When you _excel_ at
something, you are good at
it.

The kids I visit all excel
at different things. Some of
them excel at sports like running or jumping rope.

Some of them excel at math. Some of them excel at
skipping rocks or standing on their hands. All of them are
good at something.

I visit with the kids. I chat with them. I ask them how
they got started doing what they do and how they got good
at it. Sometimes I chat with their moms and dads, too. I jot
down notes and take snapshots. Then I write up what they
tell me so I can share it with you.

In _Kids Excel_ you will meet a lot of kids who excel. I had fun
meeting them. I think you will like meeting them, too.

When I meet someone who excels at something, it inspires me
to be as good as I can be. I hope the kids in _Kids Excel_ have the
same effect on you, too!

**The Spelling Bee**


This past spring I went to see the state spelling bee.

The state spelling bee is a spelling contest that lasts two
days. On Day One, a bunch of kids sit down to take a written
spelling test. On Day Two, the kids who do the best on the
written test get up on a stage and spell.

One hundred ten kids took the spelling test last spring. The
kids had to spell words like _chimpanzee_ . The fifty who did the
best on the written test went on to Day Two of the spelling bee.

Day Two is the part of the bee I like best. That’s when the
kids get up on stage and spell words out loud.

A person will say a word. Then the speller has to spell the
word one letter at a time. If the speller spells the word without
a mistake, they get to keep spelling. If the speller makes a
mistake, a bell rings.


Foundational Skills 3



**21**


**22**



Once the bell rings, that is the end. The speller is out of the bee. He
or she must sit down in a chair and look on while the rest of the spellers
stay in the bee and keep spelling.

On Day Two of the bee I sat and looked on as the bell rang for lots
of kids in the bee.

_Airplane._ A-e-r-p-l-a-n-e? _Ding!_

_Graying._ G-r-a-i-n-g? _Ding!_

_Sunday._ S-u-n-n-d-a-y? _Ding!_

The bell went on ringing all day, until there were just three spellers
left.

Carlos Lopez, age twelve, was one of the three. He was the runnerup at the last spelling bee. Two of the experts I spoke with said they
expected him to win the bee.

Amber Hunter, age twelve, was still in the game, too. She had
finished in fifth place at the last bee. The experts I spoke with said she
had a good chance of winning.

Gail Day, age eleven, was the dark horse. When I asked the spelling
experts who she was, they just shrugged.

Amber Hunter was spelling well. Then she got a hard word. She
stood thinking. She spelled the word as well as she could. She waited.


_Ding!_

Amber Hunter was out of the bee. That left just Gail Day and Carlos
Lopez.

The spelling words for this week include words with the tricky spellings ‘c’ and ‘g’.
These letters are tricky because they can be sounded out in different ways. To hear the
difference, say the words _got_ and _gem_, _cat_ and _cents_ . Please remember to practice the
spelling words for five to ten minutes each night.


Today your student is also bringing home a story to read, “Miss Baker,” and an
accompanying activity page. This is another story in our Unit 3 Reader, _Kids Excel_ . You may
remember that _Kids Excel_ is about kids who are outstanding in different ways. Miss Baker
is a teacher who helps a young girl become a good speller. After reading “Miss Baker,” have
your student answer the story questions on the accompanying activity page. You should
encourage your student to look back at the story to find the answers.

**Miss Baker**


I was sitting with spelling champ Gail Day.

I asked her, “How did this Miss Baker make you into a good
speller?”

“Well,” said Gail, “Miss Baker had a cool way of explaining English
spelling. She made spelling trees.”

“Spelling trees?”

“Yes,” said Gail. “Here, I’ll make one for you.”

Gail got a sheet of paper and made a tree.

She pointed at the trunk of the tree and explained, “The trunk
stands for a sound, like the sound /ae/ as in _cake_ . The branches stand
for the spellings for that sound. There’s one branch for words that have
the ‘a_e’ spelling like _flame_ and _stake_ . There’s one branch for words that
have the ‘ay’ spelling like _play_ and _stay_ . There’s one branch for words
that have the ‘ai’ spelling like _pain_ and _train_ . And so on. Get it?”


Foundational Skills 3



**45**


**46**



“Got it.”

“So Miss Baker would make a big spelling tree for a sound.
Then we kids would add words to it. When we found words with
the sound in them we would stick the words on the branches of
the tree. We would stick all of the words with the ‘ai’ spelling on
this branch. We would stick all of the words with the ‘ay’ spelling
on that branch.”

“I see. And this helped you get better at spelling?”

Gail nodded.

“The spelling trees helped us see the patterns and keep track
of the spellings. They helped us see which spellings are used a lot
and which ones are used less. There were a lot of good spellers in
Miss Baker’s class.”

“But not all of them went on to win the state spelling bee,” I
said. “Why did you?”

Gail shrugged.

“I was good at spelling. But I did not understand why English
spelling was so hard. Once I asked Miss Baker why it was so hard.
‘Miss Baker,’ I said, ‘why are there five or six spellings for some
sounds? That makes no sense. Why isn’t there just one spelling for
a sound?’”

Miss Baker explained as much as she could. Then she gave me
a book on spelling. It was a cool book. It explained how English
has taken in lots of spellings from French, Latin, Greek, and
Spanish. When I finished that book, Miss Baker gave me a longer
book. Then I found the next book by myself. One book sort of led to the
next. So that’s how I got started.”

**The Swimming Sisters**


Kim and Val Castro are swimming sisters.

Kim is sixteen. Val is fifteen. The sisters swim for the Red River
Swim Program (RRSP). Both of them are fast. In fact, they are two of
the fastest swimmers in the state.

I went to see the two sisters at the pool where they swim. They
were training for a big meet.

“So,” I said, “do I dare ask which of you is faster?”

Kim smiled. “I am faster in the sprints,” she said. “But Val is faster
in the long races.”

“So what counts as a sprint in swimming?”

“The 50 Free is a sprint,” said Kim.

“Fifty?” I said. “Is that fifty feet?”

“No,” said Kim, “it’s fifty yards.”

“Gosh!” I said. “Fifty yards? That’s a sprint? It sounds long to me!
You see, I am not much of a swimmer.”

“The 50 Free is an all-out sprint,” Kim said. “It’s like the hundred
yard dash in track. It’s over in a flash. The 100 Free is a sprint, too.”

“So what counts as a long race in swimming?”

“The 500 Free is a long race,” Kim groaned. “It’s too long for me. I

start to get tired after one hundred fifty yards or so. But not Val! The
longer the race is, the better she is.”

“The 500 Free is my best race!” said Val.

“Five hundred yards?” I said. “What’s that, a hundred laps?”

“Um, no,” Val said. “In a twenty-five-yard pool, it’s up and back
ten times.”

I jotted notes in my notebook.

“So let’s see,” I said. “One hundred yards counts as a short race.
Kim is good at the short races. Five hundred yards is a long race.
Val is good at the long races. Is there a race that is longer than one
hundred yards and shorter than five hundred?”

“Yes, there is,” said Kim. “The 200 Free.”

“So which of you speedsters wins that race?” I asked.

Kim looked at Val. She had a smile on her face. It was a sister-tosister smile, and there was something else in it. There was a sort of
challenge in the look.

Val smiled back. She had the same look on her face.

I waited.

At last Kim spoke. “It’s hard to say who is faster in the 200 Free.
Sometimes Val wins and sometimes I win.”

“I see,” I said. “It sounds like the 200 Free is the race to see. When
will that race take place?”

“It will be on Sunday,” said Val, “the last day of the state meet.”

I got out my pen and wrote: “Sunday the twenty-fifth. 200 Free.
Castro versus Castro!”

the beginning of the words and the suffixes _–ing_ and _–ed_ . These words are challenging
because students may try to spell them with more common spellings. For example, they
might want to spell _whipped_ as _wipped_, or _knotted_ as _notted_ . Please remember to practice
the spelling words for five to ten minutes each night.

**The Big Race**


I got to the pool in time for the 200 Free. I sat in the stands with
Grover and Joan Castro, Kim and Val’s parents.

“I am so proud of Kim and Val,” said Grover Castro. “But I
have a bad case of nerves. I hate it when the two of them swim in
the same race. They have both been training so hard. They would
both like to win this race. But they can’t both win. I don’t like to
think that one of them may be upset.”

A man’s booming voice filled the air. “It’s time for the last race
of the meet!” the man said.

“Let’s meet our swimmers!” The man started listing the
swimmers in the race.

“In Lane Two,” he said, “from Red River Swim Program, we
have the winner of the 500 Free, Val Castro.” Cheers rose up from
the RRSP swimmers on the deck and from fans in the stands.

“In Lane Three,” the man said, “from Red River Swim Program,
the winner of the 50 and 100 Free, Kim Castro.” There were shouts
and cheers for Kim, as well.

The swimmers got up on the starting blocks.

A man in a white coat said, “Swimmers, take your marks.” The
swimmers bent down and grabbed the starting blocks.

Then there was a beep. The swimmers shot off. Kim’s start was
perfect. She did her kick. Then she popped up and started

Then there was a beep. The swimmers shot off. Kim’s start
was perfect. She did her kick. Then she popped up and started
swimming. Her arms went so fast. She seemed to be coasting.

Kim was the fastest swimmer for a hundred yards. She made
a big wave. The rest of the swimmers were trailing her. They
seemed to be bouncing and sloshing in Kim’s waves.

I was starting to think it would not be such a close race after
all. But just as I was thinking this, Grover Castro said, “Wait for
it!”

“Wait for what?” I said.

“You’ll see!” said Grover.

I looked back at the pool. Kim was still winning. But Val was
closing in on her. The gap was five feet. Then it was three.

The swimmers flipped one last time. Kim was starting to
look a bit tired. The gap was down to two feet. Then it was one
foot. Then the two sisters were swimming side by side. As they
came to the finish line it was too close to pick a winner. Kim and
Val smacked the side of the pool at what looked to be the same
moment.

A hundred parents in the stands looked up at the clock. A
hundred swimmers on the deck looked up as well.

This is what the clock said:


Val Castro Lane 2 1:45

Kim Castro Lane 3 1:46


Val was the winner!

Our spelling words this week are antonyms and synonyms. Antonyms are words that
mean the opposite. For example, _cold_ is an antonym of _hot_ . Synonyms are words that have
almost the same meaning. _Cool_ is a synonym for _cold_ . You can practice with your student in
this way: say the italicized word and ask your student to think of the word that is a synonym
or antonym for that word and write it down. For example:


You say, “Write the antonym for _over._ ” Then your student should say and then write
the word _under_ on paper. Remember, in addition to practicing spelling words, it is a great
benefit for students to read at least twenty minutes every night.

**The Big Storm**

Last winter, we got stuck in a big ice storm. The sleet
started to come down at noon. When Mom and Dad
picked me up at three, sleet was on the ground and on the
roads.

We started to drive home. That was when things got
exciting. The sleet started coming down harder and
harder. It got deeper and deeper. The car started slipping
and sliding. I was scared. Dad had to creep along and so
did lots of other cars. Then, the cars stopped and there was
a big traffic jam. Mom got out and looked down the road
to see if cars were moving at all. No one was moving!

We had just passed the road to my granddad’s house.
Mom called my granddad and asked if we could come and
visit. He said we could. So Dad drove to my granddad’s
house. It took us a long time to get there. There was so
much ice that we couldn’t see the road! We ended up
sleeping at my granddad’s house and waiting until the state
trucks came and plowed the roads. We had fun being iced
in!

**Cupcakes with Mom**

Last week, I made cupcakes with Mom. We went to the
shop to pick up the items we needed for the cupcakes. We
got frosting and cake mix. We got cooking oil and eggs.

When we got home, we unpacked our bags and
switched on the oven. Mom got out a mixing dish and a
spoon. I dumped the cake mix in the dish. Mom let me
add the oil and two eggs. I mixed everything together.
Mom added paper liners to the cupcake pan. Then I got
a spoon and scooped the batter into the cupcake liners.
Mom set the timer for the cupcakes to bake in the oven.

Waiting for the cupcakes to cook was the hardest part.
It took so long! I kept checking on the cupcakes. At last,
the timer started beeping. I jumped up and down and
shouted, “Cupcakes! Cupcakes!” Mom got mitts and
pulled out the hot pan. The sweet smell of fresh baked
cupcakes filled the kitchen. Mom and I put sweet, pink
frosting on the cupcakes. I got frosting on my fingers and
licked it off. Then Mom and I each chose a cupcake to eat.
Yum, yum! Those were the best cupcakes!

This week we will be writing personal narratives. Students will go through the entire
writing process, from planning to editing. We will begin with writing a class narrative and
then the students will write their own narrative with a partner.


We will finish our current reading unit this Friday and will have several assessments to
make sure students have learned the skills in this unit.


For this reason, your student will not have spelling words or a test this week. Students
will have homework each night to prepare them for the unit assessments. As this is review
work, they should be able to complete the homework independently. Please assist your
student in completing the homework only if necessary.


Continue to read with your student each night. You will be surprised by how fast your
student will progress if he or she reads aloud to you twenty minutes every night. Be aware
that this reading does not have to be a book; it can be labels of cans that you have in the
cupboard or cereal boxes or comics! Nor does the reading have to take place at home; it
can take place in the car or standing in line at the grocery store.


As always, if you have questions, feel free to contact me. When home and school work
together as a team, your student wins!

Our class has been working on writing personal narratives at school. Your student has
read personal narratives, and we have drafted a personal narrative as a class. Now, each
student will have an opportunity to write his or her own personal narrative describing
something that happened to him or her. As homework, please work with your student to
brainstorm ideas that he or she might write about in a personal narrative. Remind your
student that the personal narrative is nonfiction; it should tell about something that really
happened to him or her. Here are some ideas for topics your student might be interested
in writing about:


    - a special holiday or birthday

    - a special present he or she received

    - something a friend or sibling did for him or her

    - a special visit or a trip to an interesting place

    - a “first” or significant personal achievement

    - a weather-related event


Have your student jot down ideas on the back of this page and bring it back to school for
the next Writing lesson.

Jo, of the Inuit, has a home not so far from the
North Pole. While her dad hunts, her home is an igloo. It is
made from solid ice blocks. You may not think it, but her
home is snug inside. Jo’s dad keeps a fire going inside the
ice home. There is a hole in the roof to let the smoke from
the fire escape.

It is freezing at the North Pole. There are lots of frozen
slabs of ice. The wind tosses things around as it swoops
down from the Pole. If you go to visit Jo, take lots of thick
clothing. Take an overcoat and a scarf. Take boots, too. If
you don’t, you could end up with frozen toes.

**Sound Quest /ie/**

Last Friday, Mike and his dad visited the zoo in Ohio.
Mike was excited at the idea of seeing the tigers, but as
soon as he saw them, he became scared. (Mike is only
five.) His dad tried to tell Mike that it would be fine, but
Mike started weeping. He was scared of the tigers! At
last, Mike’s dad asked Mike if he’d like to see the hippos
instead. Mike nodded and his sobs went away. He was
quiet as he and his dad tried to find the hippos. Once
they found them, Mike started smiling and chatting with
his dad.

**Sound Quest /ue/**

Last week, my sister and I discussed whether or not
unicorns exist. I tried to tell my sister that unicorns are
not real, but she did not listen to me. She said that they
are just as real as humans. She said that she’s seen one. If
you ask me, I think she has confused a horse or a mule
with a unicorn. We continued our dispute, but then I
realized that arguing with her is useless. I will never be
able to get her to understand that unicorns don’t exist.
Besides, it’s sort of cute that she thinks unicorns are real.
