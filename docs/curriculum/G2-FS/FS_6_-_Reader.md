Many Americans were angry with the **British** . Some of
them were saying the United States should **declare war**
on Great Britain . But others disagreed . They said the
United States should not go to war .

Madison was president of the United States . He had



12


13


At the time, Great Britain was already at war with
France . The two countries had been fighting for years .
Most of the countries in Europe were involved in the
war . Some sided with the British . Others sided with the
French .

The French were led by a man named Napoleon .
He was a brave leader . He had beaten the British in a
number of battles . Still, the British kept fighting .



14


15


The United States tried to stay out of this big war .
At first, most Americans did not care to get involved .
American **traders** wished to trade with both Great
Britain and France . But this led to problems .

When U .S . ships traded with the British, the French
got upset . They did not want Americans trading with
their enemies . When U .S . ships traded with the French,
the British got upset for the same reason .

Sometimes British ships would stop American ships
to keep them from trading with the French . Sometimes
French ships would stop American ships to keep them
from trading with the British .

The Americans had problems with both the French
and the British . As time went on, the problems with
the British increased .



16


17


The British had a strong **army** and an even stronger
**navy** . But serving in the British Navy was a hard job .
Some people quit . Others ran away . This was a problem
for the British . They needed all the men they could get .
How else could they **defeat** the French?

The British spent a lot of time looking for men
who had run off . From time to time they would stop
American ships . British officers would come on deck
to look for British men . They would grab men and
force them to serve in the British Navy . This was called
**impressment** .

The British said they only took British men who
had run away . But they were not always careful .
Sometimes they grabbed Americans . Stories about men
taken by the British were printed in the papers . How
do you think Americans felt when they read them?
They felt angry . Some of them felt the United States
needed to fight back . They said the United States
needed to declare war on Great Britain .



18


19


Impressment was one problem . But there were
others . Many in the United States were also upset with
the British for trading with Native Americans .

In 1812, most Americans were farmers . At first,
most farmers had homes near the East Coast . But then
the country began to grow . People went west . They
settled in places far from the coast . They set up farms .
They planted crops . There was just one problem: there
were already people living there!

The settlers were moving onto land where Native
Americans hunted and made their homes . Native
Americans did not like this . There were many fights
between settlers and Native Americans .



20


21


The British controlled Canada . They sent traders
south from Canada to trade with Native Americans .
These traders sold all sorts of things to Native
Americans .

The British said they had a right to trade with
Native Americans . But lots of people in the United
States did not see it that way . They said the British were
helping Native Americans attack American settlers .
They felt they needed to fight back .

You can see there were many reasons for Americans
to be angry with the British . But there were also
good reasons for not declaring war . A war causes
death, wrecks towns, and costs a lot of money . Plus,
Americans felt that the British would not be easy to
defeat . President Madison and the men in Congress
would have to think long and hard about declaring war .



22


23


At first, President Madison tried to keep America
out of the war . He tried to make a deal with the British .
He asked them to stop taking American sailors . He
asked them to stop trading with Native Americans . But
he did not ask Congress to declare war .

This made some people happy . There were many
people in the United States who did not care to go
to war . Most **merchants** and traders felt this way .
Most of them had homes in the cities along the East
Coast . They traded with Great Britain, as well as
other countries . A war would mean less trade between
countries . It would mean sunken ships and lost goods .
A war would cost them money . For this reason, as well
as some others, most merchants **opposed** the war .



24


But others felt a war was needed . The states out
west, like Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee, were closer

with the British .


States needed to declare war .



26


When some War Hawks found out that the British
were selling guns to Native Americans, it made them
angry .

These War Hawks gave President Madison an
earful . They got up in Congress and made angry
speeches . They said that the United States should stand
up to Great Britain . They said that Madison should ask
Congress to declare war .



28


29


Presidents have to make hard choices . James
Madison had to decide whether to side with the War
Hawks or with the merchants who hoped for peace . In
the end, he sided with the War Hawks . Madison asked
Congress to declare war . On June 18, 1812, the United
States declared war on Great Britain .

The Americans were in for a hard fight . The
British had a huge army . They also had the world’s
biggest navy . But the British were already at war with
France . They could only send some of their troops to
fight the United States . That was a good thing for the
Americans . It meant that the United States would have
a better chance of winning .



30


31


Even so, not a lot of people at the time could
imagine that the United States could win . Today the
United States is a strong nation . It has been around for
many years . It has a strong army and navy . But that was
not the case in 1812 .

In 1812, the United States was not very old as a
country . It had broken away from Great Britain only
about 30 years before .

The United States had a different kind of
government, too . At the time, most of the nations
of Europe were **monarchies** . That means they were
ruled by kings or queens . A king or queen would rule
until he or she died . Then, in most cases, the oldest
son would take over . The United States was not a
monarchy . It did not have a king or queen . Instead, it
had a president . The president was chosen by voters .
He did not get to serve until he died . He served for
four years . Then the voters got a chance to pick their
president . If they voted for a different president, the old
one had to step down .

In 1812, most people in the world felt that the
American government had a very strange way of doing
things . They were not sure that the system would last
and that the United States would be able to survive .



32


33


In 1812, the United States did not have a strong
army . In fact, the U .S . Army was tiny . It had about
4,000 soldiers .

The navy was tiny, too . George Washington, the
first president, had set it up . He didn’t think the United
States needed a big navy, but just a small number of
ships to protect merchants from pirates .

President Madison found a way to make the army
bigger . He got farmers to join . Many Americans were
farmers . They used guns to hunt and to defend their
homes . Madison called on these farmers . He asked
them to grab their guns and join the army . Farmers
were paid money and given land for joining .

The U .S . soldiers were not well trained . Still,
Madison was sure they could win if they attacked the
British in Canada . He sent the army north to Canada .

The attack on Canada did not go well . The army
lost a string of battles . The United States lost **forts**
along the border . The army was simply not ready for
war .



34


35


No one expected much from the tiny U .S . Navy .
But things went better on the seas than they did on
land . The United States battled bravely . They beat the
British in a number of naval battles .



36


37


The ship on the right is the USS _Constitution_ . It was
one of the ships that battled in the War of 1812 . The
letters ‘USS’ stand for _United States Ship_ .



38


39


The USS _Constitution_ was named for a very
important **document**, the Constitution of the United
States . The Constitution lays out the laws of the land .
It states what people serving in each **branch** of the
U .S . government can do and establishes the rights of
U .S . citizens . It says what the president, the Congress,
and the **Supreme Court** can do—and also what they
cannot do .

James Madison had helped write the Constitution .
He had also played a key role in getting states to accept
it . The people of the United States were proud of the
Constitution, so they named one of their fighting ships



40


41


During the War of 1812, the USS _Constitution_ had
a **string** of battles on the high seas .

In one battle, the USS _Constitution_ attacked a
British ship . It was a hard fight . The sailors on both
sides fired cannons . The guns blazed and smoked . The
two ships drifted closer . Once they even bumped into
each other .

Cannonballs from the USS _Constitution_ smashed
into the side of the British ship . They made big holes in
it . They ripped off a sail . They knocked down the ship’s
**masts** .

The British ship fired back . But its cannonballs did
less damage to the U .S . ship . In fact, some of them
bounced off the thick walls of the American ship!

When the American sailors saw this, they cheered .

“Hooray!” one of them shouted . “Her sides are
made of iron!”

In fact, however, the sides of the ship were not
made of iron but of very thick **planks** of wood . The
wooden sides of the USS _Constitution_ were much
thicker than most ships .



42


43


The USS _Constitution_ won the battle . The British
ship was so smashed up that it could not be fixed . The
British had to sink it .

When people were told about the battle, they
became excited . They yelled and shouted . They waved
flags and had parties . They treated the sailors on the
USS _Constitution_ as heroes . They also gave the ship a
nickname . They called it “Old Ironsides” because its
wooden sides seemed as strong as iron .

Old Ironsides kept on fighting . It battled more than




45


In August of 1814, President Madison was upset .
Two years had passed . The war was still going on . The
U .S . Army had won some battles, and it had lost some
battles .

The British had landed an army near Washington,
D .C . British soldiers were marching . Madison hoped
the U .S . Army would be able to stop them .

At the time, Washington, D .C ., was a young town .
Some buildings had just been finished, such as the
**Capitol** . Others were not finished yet . Still, it was an
important place . It was where the U .S . Congress met to
make laws . It was where the Supreme Court met .



46


the White House .) It was only about ten years old at
the time . It was home to President Madison and his
wife, Dolley .


to be a big battle outside the city . He planned to go
**support the troops** . He ordered some soldiers to

he jumped on his horse and rode off .

The battle outside the city did not go well . The
U .S . Army was beaten .

People quickly found out about the **defeat** . The
army had lost! The British were coming! People in the
city **panicked** . They grabbed their things and ran away .
The roads were jammed with people and carts .



48


49


President Madison could not get back to the
President’s House . His wife, Dolley, was left there with
servants and soldiers .

The soldiers ran away .

Mrs . Madison could not stay in the President’s
House . The British would be there soon . She had to
**flee** .

Mrs . Madison hoped to take as much with her as
she could . But which things should she take? There
were many fine things in the President’s House . She
loved a lamp that hung in one room . But there was no
way she could take that . It was too heavy . She had a big
closet of fancy dresses . She loved them, too . But there
were more important things for her to carry away .




51


In the end, Mrs . Madison left most of her own
things behind . Instead, she carried away things that
were important to the American people . She grabbed
papers and letters . She stuffed as many of them as she
could into a **trunk** .

Mrs . Madison was ready to leave . Then she

the hands of the British . She called one of President
Madison’s trusted servants, Paul Jennings, for help .
There was no time to take the painting gently from its


the door to safety .



52


The British Army marched into Washington, D .C .
The British soldiers were angry because the U .S . Army
had burned York, the capital city of Canada . They
planned to get back at the Americans by burning the
U .S . Capitol Building .

The British soldiers went to the Capitol Building .
This was where the U .S . Congress met . They set it on
fire . Then they marched down the hill to the President’s
House .

The British arrived just after Dolley Madison left .
They broke down the doors and **charged** inside .



54


55


The President’s House was empty . In the dining
room, the table had been set for dinner .

The British general sat down with some of his men .
They ate dinner . As a joke, they **toasted** President
Madison . They lifted up their glasses and thanked him
for the meal .

After dinner, the British soldiers started smashing
things . They smashed the dishes . They smashed the
table . They smashed the chairs .

The soldiers ran up and down in the President’s
House looking for things to steal . They took the spoons
and forks . They took the buckles from Mrs . Madison’s
shoes . They even took the love letters her husband had
sent her! The house was **ransacked** .

Then the British general ordered his men to set
the house on fire . The soldiers lit their **torches** . Then
they went from room to room . They lit the **drapes** on
fire . They burned the beds . They burned the desks and
chairs . They even burned Mrs . Madison’s dresses .



56


Then the British marched away . They did not care
to take over the city . They just planned to burn it .
Burning the city would be a **heavy blow** . The British
hoped the Americans might feel like there was no
longer hope and stop fighting .

Later that day a storm rolled in . The rain stopped
most of the fires . But it was too late . Many of the
buildings were already lost .

Later in the week, the Madisons came home . The
President’s House was still standing . But it was a mess .
The walls were black with **soot** . The windows were
broken . All of their things had been stolen or burned .
They felt they would never call the President’s House
home again .



58


59


Washington, D .C ., took ten years to construct . It
took less than one day to destroy it .

Next, the British planned to attack Baltimore .
Baltimore was a big city north of Washington, D .C .
At the time, it was the third largest city in the United
States . It was also a key **port** .



60


Baltimore was protected from naval attack by a large
fort . It was called Fort McHenry .

The British focused on Fort McHenry . They hoped
that if they could take the fort, they could take the city .
They planned to attack the fort by land and also by sea .

The people of the city were aware an attack was
coming . They got ready . They **piled up** supplies . They
set up walls . They even sank ships in the **harbor** to
keep the British ships from getting too close to the
city . All of the people in the city **pitched in** . Even the
children helped .



62


63


they needed a flag they could fly over the fort . They
asked a local woman named Mary Pickersgill to make a
flag . “Make it big,” they told her . “Make it so big that
the British will be able to see it from miles away!”

The U .S . flag is covered with stars and stripes .
Today, the U .S . flag has fifty stars and thirteen stripes .
Each star stands for one of the fifty states of the United
States . Each stripe stands for one of the thirteen
original colonies . Sometimes America’s flag is referred
to as “the stars and stripes .”



64


65


The flag that Mary Pickersgill made for Fort
McHenry was different . It had fifteen stars and fifteen
stripes .

The Fort McHenry flag was different in another
way, too . It was huge! Each star was two feet across .
Each stripe was two feet tall and forty-two feet long .

Mrs . Pickersgill could not do all the **stitching**
herself . The flag was too big . She needed help . She got
her daughter to help her . But she still needed more
help . She had her servants help with the stitching . Still
she needed more help . She sent for two of her **nieces** .
That did the trick . She and her five helpers stitched day
and night until the flag was finished .

When it was done, the flag was as large as a house .
It was hung on a giant pole over the fort . You could see
it from miles away .



66


The British arrived later in the week . They sent
troops to attack the city . But this time the U .S . soldiers
were ready . They stopped the British Army . The British
**commander** was killed during the attack .

The British went back to their ships . They decided
to attack Fort McHenry with their navy instead .



68


69


On September 13, 1814, British ships **opened fire**
on Fort McHenry . They fired **rockets** and **mortars** .

The soldiers in the fort would have fired back, but
there was not much point . The guns in the fort were
old . They could not hit the British ships .

The British ships kept firing for a long time . They
fired all day . They fired on into the night .

mean that the troops in the fort had given up .


sun set . He was proud that the flag was still flying .



72


73


At night it was harder for Key to see . But there
were flashes of light . Sometimes a rocket would go
**streaking** through the darkness . Sometimes a bomb
would explode and light up the sky . The flashes of light
allowed Key to see the flag .

The firing went on until just before dawn . Then it
stopped . The sun had not come up yet . It was still dark .
There were no rockets blasting . There were no bombs
bursting in the air . Key could not see much . The silence
was puzzling . What did it mean? Was the battle over?
Had the soldiers in the fort given up? Key could not
tell .

Key waited nervously . At last the sun rose . Key
looked at the fort . And what did he see? The soldiers
had raised the huge flag that Mrs . Pickersgill had made .
It was not the U .S . soldiers who had given up . It was
the British sailors! They had stopped firing on the fort .

Key felt a surge of joy . He felt pride, too . The brave
men in the fort had not given up!



74


Key felt **inspired** . He hoped to share with others
what he had seen . He needed to tell what it was like to
wait and wait—and then see the flag still flying in the
morning . Key reached into his pocket . He found an old
letter . On the back, he wrote a poem . Here is the first
part of his poem:


_O say can you see by the dawn’s early light_

_What so proudly we_ _**hailed**_ _at the twilight’s last_
_gleaming?_

_Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the_
_**perilous**_ _fight,_
_O’er the_ _**ramparts**_ _we watched were so_ _**gallantly**_
_streaming?_
_And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in_
_air,_

_Gave_ _**proof**_ _through the night that our flag was_
_still there._

_O say does that Star-Spangled Banner yet wave_

_O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?_


Key did not know then that, one day, his poem
would become our **national anthem** .



76


77


After the Battle of Baltimore, both sides began to
get tired of the war . They called a meeting . Men from
both sides sat down to try to form a **peace treaty** . But
in the meantime, the war went on .

The British sent troops to attack the city of New
Orleans, on the Gulf of Mexico .



78


79


You can see why New Orleans is an important place
if you look at the map on the next page . The city is
located at the **mouth** of the Mississippi River, right
where the river drains into the Gulf of Mexico . From
New Orleans you can travel north along the Mississippi
River . You can also turn off onto other rivers that feed
into the Mississippi, like the Ohio River . These rivers
are like highways that lead right into the middle of
North America .

In 1814, New Orleans was already an important,
big port . Lots of ships landed there . Farmers could
ship their goods down the river and sell them in New
Orleans . Traders could unload goods in New Orleans
and ship them up the river . New Orleans was an
important city, not only for the people who had homes
there, but also for the farmers up the river in places like
Ohio and Kentucky .

If the British took New Orleans, they could control
trade along the Mississippi . Farmers in Ohio and
Kentucky would be cut off . The Americans could not
let this happen . They sent an army to defend the city .
The army was led by a man named Andrew Jackson .



80


81


Andrew Jackson was from Tennessee . He had
joined the U .S . Army during the American Revolution .
At the time he was just a boy . He was too young to
fight . He carried notes from place to place for soldiers .

During the Revolution, Jackson and his brother
were taken prisoner by the British . It was a difficult
time for them . They were treated badly . They almost
starved to death . Jackson’s brother got sick and died .

While he was a prisoner, Jackson had a run-in with
a British officer . The man ordered Jackson to clean his
boots . Jackson was proud and stubborn . He refused .
The man shouted at Jackson . Still Jackson refused . The
man struck Jackson with his weapon . Jackson was left
with a scar on his face .

As a result of this, Andrew Jackson had no love for
the British . He was happy to fight them again as an
army **general** when the War of 1812 broke out .



82


_**Andrew Jackson**_



83


Jackson had not been trained as a soldier . But he
was bold and strong . His mother had died when he was
young . He had gotten by on his own as an **orphan** . He
had made his own way in life .

During the first part of the War of 1812, Jackson
battled against Native Americans in the west . Many
Native Americans had sided with the British .

Jackson’s men called him “Old **Hickory** ” because
he was as strong as a **knotty** old piece of hickory wood .
In 1814, “Old Hickory” was given an important job .
He was told to raise an army to protect New Orleans .
Jackson rushed to the city . He picked up new troops
along the way . Many of the men who joined him were
farmers . But there were also free African Americans,
Native Americans, and even pirates . When Jackson
arrived, he ordered his **ragtag** army to set up walls and
get ready for an attack . Then they waited .



84


85


On January 8, 1815, the British attacked New
Orleans . They planned on winning without much
trouble . But they did not know how brave Andrew
Jackson and his men were—or how good they were
with their weapons .


of them charged . Jackson’s men crouched behind their
walls . They took careful aim . Then they fired . Their
bullets hit the first wave of British soldiers .


all over, the U .S . flag was still flying . The British gave
up their attack .



86


87


The British took heavy losses . Two thousand of
their men were killed or hurt . The U .S . Army lost no
more than one hundred men . New Orleans was safe!
Americans cheered for Andrew Jackson and the Battle
of New Orleans .

After time passed, a letter arrived . It said that the
war was already over . On December 24, 1814, the
United States and Great Britain had signed a treaty to
end the war . This was two weeks before the Battle of
New Orleans! But Jackson and his men did not know
that .

In those days news traveled slowly . There were no
radios or television sets . There were no phones . There
were no computers to send emails . A letter could only
travel as fast as the man who carried it . It took a couple
of weeks for news of the treaty to get from Europe to
the United States . That is why Jackson and his men
did not find out about the treaty until after the battle .
America’s greatest victory in the War of 1812 came after
the war was already over!



88


89


The War of 1812 lasted three years . It’s hard to say
who won . Both sides won battles . The British burned
Washington, D .C . But the Americans won the Battle of
New Orleans . “Old Ironsides” won a number of battles
on the sea . But other U .S . ships were sunk . All in all,
there was no clear winner .

It might seem as if the war was for nothing . But
some things had changed . The Americans had battled
together as a nation, and they had done it well . They
had taken on the mighty British and had held their
own . The world saw they were strong .

The end of the war marked the start of a new age in
U .S . history . It was an age of national pride . The War
of 1812 showed that the United States of America was
here to stay .



90


91


A national anthem is a special **patriotic** song .
Many countries have a national anthem . People sing a
national anthem to show that they are proud of their
country .

In the United States, our national anthem is “The
Star-Spangled Banner .” The words to this song were
written by Francis Scott Key during the War of 1812 .
The song describes what Key saw during the attack on
Fort McHenry .

After the attack, he saw the U .S . flag, or in his
words, the “star-spangled banner .”



92


93



93


We sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” before

holidays like the Fourth of July . We sing it on special
days when we gather together . Sometimes we sing it
at school . We sing it to show that we care about our
country .

In the United States, we always stand when we
sing or hear the national anthem . If you are playing or
talking and you hear this song, you should stop what
you are doing and turn to face a flag . You may wish to

still and look at the flag until the song is over . You
should never talk or giggle or fool around during the
national anthem .



94


95


During the national anthem, you will see men
taking off their hats . You may also see soldiers **saluting**
the flag . They salute by bringing their right hand up to
their head or the tip of their hat . Also, the flag should
never touch the ground . These are all ways of showing
respect for the U .S . flag and pride in our country .



96


97


You know that “The Star-Spangled Banner” was
written by Francis Scott Key . But did you know that
it was not always our national anthem? In fact, it took

Francis Scott Key wrote “The Star-Spangled
Banner” more than two hundred years ago . There are
some old words in the poem . Some parts can be hard
to understand . Let’s look at the words and try to make
sense of them . Two things that are important to know
before we start reading are: “O’er” is a short form of
the word _over_, and “O” is another way of spelling the
exclamation “Oh!” .

On the next page is the first verse of the song, the
part that we sing before a sporting event . Can you read
it two or three times?



102


103


To make sense of the “The Star-Spangled Banner,”
it helps to think of what Francis Scott Key was doing
the night he wrote it . Key was watching the attack on
Fort McHenry . In the poem he describes the attack as a
“perilous fight .” That means it was a dangerous battle .

During the battle, Key kept his eye on Fort
McHenry . In the poem he mentions the ramparts, or
walls, of the fort . But what Key talks about the most is
the U .S . flag that he could see flying over the fort .

Key says the flag is “spangled,” or dotted, with stars .
He also talks about its “broad stripes .” When the wind
blows, Key says these stripes blow back and forth . They
look like they are “streaming” or rippling in the air .
Have you ever seen a flag look that way?



104


105


In the poem, Key describes three different times
when he looked for the flag . First, he tells us he looked
for the flag at “the twilight’s last gleaming,” or just as
the sun set . Since it was not dark yet, Key could see . He
saw that the flag was still flying over the fort . That was
good . It means that the troops had not given up .

Key tells us he also looked for the flag at night .
You might think he would not be able to see much at
night . But Key explains that the “rocket’s red glare” and
the “bombs bursting in air” lit up the night sky . These
flashes of light helped him see . They gave him “proof”
that the flag was still flying .

Key looked for the flag again just before dawn . This
time he could not see it . Remember, the attack on the
fort had stopped just before dawn . There were no more
“bombs bursting in air .” There was no more “rocket’s
red glare .” It was dark . Was the flag still flying? Had
the troops in the fort given up? Or had the British? In
the time before the sun rose, Key did not know . At that
time, he had a lot of questions, but not a lot of answers .



106


Look back at the words Key wrote . Do you see the
question marks? There are three of them . An important
thing to understand about our national anthem is that
it starts with a set of questions .

In the first lines, Key asks a question:


Wow! That’s a long sentence . Suppose we broke it
up into shorter sentences and used simpler words . Then
it might sound like this: “The sun is coming up . Tell
me, my friend, can you see the flag? Remember? We
saw it last night at sunset . Now the night has passed . Is
it still there?”



108


109


In the last lines of the song, Key asks another
question . He says,


The “star-spangled banner” is the American flag .
“The land of the free and the home of the brave” is
what Key calls his country . It’s another name for the
United States . So Key is really asking the same thing he
asked before . He is asking, “Is our flag still waving?”



110


111


Key asks these questions, but it might seem like he
never answers them . In fact, he does . If you ever get a
chance to read the rest of the poem, you will see that
Key answers his own questions a little later . There is a
part later in the poem where he says, “Yes! The flag is
still flying! Hooray!” But that is in a part of the poem
that we don’t sing very much . Most of the time we only
sing the part with the questions . We don’t sing the part
with the answers .

So the next time you sing or hear the national
anthem, think of Francis Scott Key . Think of him
watching the bombs bursting over Fort McHenry .
Think of him checking on the flag and wondering if it’s
still flying . If you keep your eyes on the flag during the
song, you will be doing just what Francis Scott Key was
doing that night long ago .

Dolley Payne Madison was the wife of the fourth
president of the United States, James Madison . The
president’s wife is called the First Lady . Dolley Madison
was one of the most famous First Ladies in history .

Dolley Madison was born Dolley Payne in 1768 .
She had four brothers and three sisters . When she was
a little girl, she and her family had a very simple life .
They belonged to the Quaker church . Quakers believed
in living simply . They went to plain **meeting halls**
instead of fancy churches . They ate plain food .

Dolley had a strict **upbringing** . She was not
allowed to sit with the boys in church or in school . She
was not allowed to dance or play cards .

115


When she was young, Dolley Payne loved books .
She liked going to school . She had lots of friends . She
loved the color yellow . She hoped to get a nice yellow
dress, but her parents said no . They were Quakers, and
they did not believe in fancy dresses .

When Dolley Payne was an adult, she married a
man named Mr . Todd . They had a little boy . They
were married only for a little while . Then Mr . Todd got
yellow fever and died .

Mrs . Todd was a **widow** .

People told James Madison about Dolley . They said
she was smart and **charming** . He was eager to meet
her . Madison was not president at the time . But he was
already an important person . He was very smart and
serious .

James Madison was much older than Dolley
Todd . He was also shorter than her . But she liked him
anyway . She even had a funny nickname for him . She
called him the “Great Little Madison .”

Soon James Madison asked Dolley Todd to marry
him . She had to think about this because he was not a
Quaker . But, in the end, she said yes .



116


117

a great help to her husband . When he was president
he had to host fancy state dinners for visitors .
Dolley helped him . She was a charming **hostess** . She
welcomed all sorts of visitors to the President’s House .

always served her ice cream . At that time, ice cream
was something new . Lots of people had never tasted it
before .

When the British marched into Washington, D .C .,
during the War of 1812, Dolley Madison was very
brave . She stayed in the President’s House as long as
she could . Before she left, she grabbed many important
papers . She even helped to save a painting of George
Washington .

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with this program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully leveled
in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.


The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many spellings
can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to make early
reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of the available
spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out as part of their
phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been deliberately
introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if they are
assigned at the proper time.


As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.
