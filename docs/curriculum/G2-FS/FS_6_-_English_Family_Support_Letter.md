# **Welcome!**
## **Grade 2, Unit 6** **Foundational Skills**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will be introduced to new spelling alternatives for vowel and consonant sounds. Students will also

learn how to use text features to help understand informational texts.


**What** **will** **my** **student** **learn?**

Students will learn spelling alternatives for vowel sounds, such as /er/ - ‘ar’ ( _dollar_ ) and /er/ - ‘or’ ( _work_ ). They will also

learn tricky spellings for vowel sounds, such as ‘ea’ - /e/ ( _head_ ), ‘i’ - /ee/ ( _ski_ ), and ‘a’ - /o/ ( _lava_ ), and spelling alternatives

for the consonant sounds /f/ - ‘ph’ ( _phone_ ) and /k/ - ‘ch’ ( _school_ ). The Reader for this unit is _The_ _War_ _of_ _1812_, which

details the first foreign conflict that the United States faced as a young nation. Due to the nature of nonfiction or

informational texts, students will learn vocabulary specific to the subject of the Reader. Students will be introduced to

expository or report writing, which focuses on organizing information into paragraphs. Students will write a report on

their learning from _The_ _War_ _of_ _1812_ .

Students can practice these Tricky Words at home by doing the following activities:


1. **Word** **Association:** Ask your student to think of other words related to the Tricky Words. This will help to

reinforce their understanding of each word's meaning and usage.

that demonstrate the meaning of each word and explain its context.

magazines, or around the house. When they identify a word, discuss its spelling and meaning.

a picture to match their sentence.
