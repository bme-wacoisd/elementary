## **Introduction:**
### **Sir Gus and His Stuff**

This reader tells the tale of Sir Gus, a knight . In the
past, there really were knights like Sir Gus . Knights
helped kings and queens keep their lands safe . Here are
some of the things a knight would have used .



2


3


Long before you were born, in a place we can no
longer find, there was a king . King Alfred was his
name .

King Alfred was in charge of a large land that
stretched from the dark forests of the north to the sea
in the south . The people of this land were very happy
with him as their king . King Alfred liked to have fun .
He liked parties and feasts . He was fair and kind, and
he kept his people safe .



6


7


King Alfred could not do this all by himself . He had
twelve knights to help him keep his lands peaceful and
his people safe . These brave knights—well, sometimes
they were brave—helped to keep bad things from
happening .



8


9


“Fearless .” This was an odd name, for Sir Gus was not
entirely fearless . In fact, he had a lot of fears .




the itching was so bad that he would start jumping
up and down .




13


## **Chapter 2**
### **The Thief**

One dark and stormy night while King Alfred was
sleeping, a thief crept into his bedroom and stole the
king’s golden ring . The next morning, when the king
woke up, he saw that his ring was gone!

The king was very sad .

“Someone stole my ring!” he cried in agony . “It
was my father’s ring, and his father’s before him . It is a
king’s ring . I must have it back!”

King Alfred was so upset in the morning; he could
not eat his herring on toast .



14


15


King Alfred summoned his twelve brave knights .
Eleven of them came at once on horseback . Sir Gus the
Fearless came later, on foot . Sir Gus explained why he
was late . He explained that he had lost his horse .

“Why, good sir,” said the king, “you will not get
very far on foot!”

“Yes, my lord . I mean no, my lord,” replied Sir Gus .
“The problem is, your majesty, that when I am on my
horse, I itch . I had such a bad itch last night that I fell
off my horse and it ran off .”



16


“Well, you must stop itching then,” said the king .

“Yes, indeed,” replied Sir Gus, trying very hard not
to itch .

Then the king told the knights what had happened .
He told them he was counting on them to recover his
ring .

The next day, at sunrise, eleven of the knights
galloped off to find the thief .



18


19


Some time after lunch, Sir Gus was awakened by
the king himself .

“Not up yet?” asked the king .

“Pardon me, my lord,” stammered Sir Gus . “I was
just . . .”

“Nevermind!” said the king . “There’s no need to
explain . Why should you be up at the crack of dawn?
For what can a knight do without a horse? But never
fear! I have a gift for you . You may take my horse . But
you must be careful, Sir Gus . My horse is the fastest in
the land .”



20


21


Sir Gus got out of bed . He stretched and yawned
loudly . Then he got dressed .

“Do not fear,” said Sir Gus, as he mounted the
horse . “I am an—”

And with that, Sir Gus was carried off . The king’s
horse had shot off like an arrow .



22


23


24


25


Sir Gus went to draw water from the well . He
grabbed the rope and began to tug on it . But then
he felt the need to scratch . He let go of the rope and
started scratching himself . Soon he was scratching
himself so hard that he started jumping up and down .
He jumped up and down so much that he fell into the
well and landed with a splash at the bottom .

“Ack!” cried Sir Gus . “What have I done?”



26


27


It was a good thing that Sir Gus was tall . The water
in the well only came up to his chest .

The young man peered down into the well .

“Have no fear!” he shouted to Sir Gus . “I will help
you . I will drop the bucket down . Take hold of it, and I
will lift you up .”

Sir Gus waited nervously at the bottom of the dark
well . He did not like the dark or the cold water . His
legs began to shiver and shake .

The bucket came down the well . Sir Gus grabbed
the bucket and held on tight .

Slowly the young man began to bring Sir Gus up
out of the well .




man offered the knight his hand .

“Young man,” said Sir Gus, as he stepped out of the
well, “I am touched by your generous deed . I would
like to thank you for helping me . What is your name?”

“My name is Robin,” replied the man .

“Well, then, Robin,” said Sir Gus, “I thank you .”

“You are welcome,” said Robin .

The two men shook hands . Robin clasped the
knight’s hand so tightly that water dripped from his
glove .

Robin smiled . “Come into my house,” he said . “I
will find you some dry clothing .”

Sir Gus went inside .

“Sit down,” said Robin . “I will fetch you some dry
clothing and something to drink .” Robin left the room .



30


31


Sir Gus sat down on a wooden chair . As he did so, a large
black cat jumped onto his lap . At once, Sir Gus began to itch
all over . He got up and started jumping up and down . He
jumped so hard that he knocked over a chair and bumped
into a shelf .

Some things fell off the shelf . As he bent down to pick
these things up, Sir Gus spotted a ring . It was the king’s ring!
Robin was the robber!



32


33


Sir Gus stood thinking for a moment .

“There is no point fighting with the man,” Sir Gus
said to himself . “That would be dangerous . I can tell by
his grip that he is very strong .”

Sir Gus grabbed the ring . Then he tiptoed quietly
out of the house . He mounted his horse and rode back
to see the king .



34


35


his ring .



36


37


For a long time, all was well . Each day the king
would hunt, fish, and eat . Each night he slept
peacefully in his bed .

Months passed . Then one snowy winter morning,
there came the sound of thunder . Except it was not
thunder . It was the thunderous cry of a troll .

The troll had woken from a long sleep . It was very
hungry . A troll is a monstrous beast . It will eat a lot of
things, but it is very fond of people .

King Alfred was frightened . He woke up when
the troll cried out . He feared for the safety of his
kingdom . He sent for his knights .



38


39


At once, eleven brave knights came . They too were
woken by the loud cry of the troll .

However, Sir Gus the Fearless did not come . The
cries of the troll had not woken him . He was still
tucked up in bed snoring . At last, the king could wait
no longer . He sent one of the other knights to fetch Sir
Gus .

Sometime after lunch, Sir Gus came . He was tired
and hungry . He had a bad cold . His nose was swollen
and red .

“What kept you?” asked the king . “Did you not
hear the sound of the troll?”

“ _Doe_, your _dajesty_,” said Sir Gus, “I did _dot_ . I have a
_dold_ in my _doze_,” replied Sir Gus .

“Well it must have stopped up your ears, too!” said
the king . “Hear me, knights! I am concerned . We must
do something to stop this monstrous troll! We must
keep this loathsome beast from eating all of the people
in my kingdom! Who has a plan?”



40


41


## **Chapter 5**
### **Fire!**

It was not hard to find the troll . Trolls cry when
they are hungry . The knights simply followed the
sound of loud sobs and eating .

As nightfall neared, the knights arrived at the foot
of a large hill . The troll had spent all day eating the
rocks and plants on the hill . All that was left on the hill
were some prickly plants and some old, dying trees .

Near the top of the hill was a cave . Scary troll
sounds were coming from inside the cave .

The knights met in a grove at the foot of the hill .
They knelt down and made a plan .

“When it is dark we will light our torches,” said
Sir Tom . “Then we will creep up the hill . The sight of
the flames will scare the troll and it will go back to its
home beneath the ground .”

“And what if that plan fails?” asked Sir Ed . “I don’t
care to be the troll’s dinner .”



44


45


“Well, do you have a better plan?” asked Sir Tom .

Sir Ed said nothing . The other knights were quiet,
as well .

At that very moment came the sound of a horse
trotting nearby .

“Found you at last!” said Sir Gus as he rode up to
the knights . “So, my fellow knights, tell me, have you
devised a plan of attack to defeat this monstrous troll?”

“Yes, we have!” said Sir Tom . “We have agreed that
our bravest knight will creep up the hill with a torch
and frighten the troll away .”




47


“Splendid idea!” said Sir Gus . “And who is
going to attempt this brave deed?” he asked,
looking around .

“You!” said Sir Tom and Sir Ed together .

“But, but . . . well . . . I . . . er . . . um . . .,” said a
reluctant Sir Gus .

It was no good trying to get out of it . Sir Tom
handed Sir Gus a lit torch . Then he pointed at
the cave .



48


49


Sir Gus went up the hill alone . By the time he
reached the mouth of the cave, it was pitch black . The
lit torch cast shadows on the ground .

Sir Gus looked around him . He saw shadows
dancing on the ground . He was afraid . But he pressed
on .

From inside the cave came alarming troll sounds .

“Snnniccck, snnnuummm, guffumffffff!”

The troll was eating bits of rock with its sharp teeth,
then spitting out the bits it did not like .

Sir Gus approached the cave . Small pieces of rock
came flying out . Some of them landed at Sir Gus’s feet .
Sir Gus jumped back, trying to avoid the flying pieces
of rock .



50


51


Suddenly there was a thumping sound . Thump!
Thump! Thump! The troll was coming out of the cave!

As the troll got closer, the sounds got louder .

“SNNNNICCCK, SNNNUUUUMMMM,
GUFFUMFFFFFF!”

Sir Gus was afraid . He started to feel weak in the
knees . At last he fainted . His torch fell to the ground .
It landed on some dry, prickly plants near the mouth
of the cave . The plants caught on fire . The flames got
bigger quickly .

From inside the cave came a scream . Then came the
thumping sound of a large beast running away . Soon,
all that remained was the sound of crackling flames .




Sir Gus lay on the ground for a while . At last
the heat from the fire woke him . He got up and
ran back down the hill .

When Sir Gus appeared, the knights shouted,
“Hooray! Brave Sir Gus lit the fire! He has driven
away the troll! Hooray for Sir Gus!”



54


55


## **Chapter 6**
### **The Boat Trip**

Word of how Brave Sir Gus had driven away the
troll went across the kingdom . The tale soon reached
King Alfred . The king was so grateful to Sir Gus that
he changed his name from Sir Gus the Fearless to Sir
Gus the Utterly Fearless . Sir Gus was given a splendid,
but rather large, red robe to keep as a symbol of his
bravery .

To celebrate the defeat of the troll, the king invited
his knights to go hunting with him . Eleven of the
knights rode off with the king to hunt for red deer and
wild pigs . Sir Gus, however, didn’t go . He did not like
hunting . It was far too dangerous .

Rather than go hunting, Sir Gus took a long,
relaxing bath . Then he went to the kitchen to see what
tasty foods were being prepared .

king’s boat .


in the sky .



58


59


Then, late in the afternoon, the sky darkened .
The wind began to blow . Large waves began to beat
on the side of the boat . Sir Gus began to feel ill .

The king was alarmed . He and eleven of the
knights had to fight to keep the boat afloat in the
strong winds and rising waves .

As for Sir Gus, he was so sick he no longer cared
if the boat floated or sank . He couldn’t stand up . He
lay in the bottom of the boat moaning and groaning .

And that is why no one saw the large pirate ship
approaching .



60


61


## **Chapter 7**
### **The King’s Ghost**

“Ar! Do as we say or die!” came the sound of a large
booming voice from somewhere on the water .

King Alfred and eleven of his knights jumped with
fright . They had all tried to sail the boat in the stormy
waves and strong winds . They looked up to see a pirate
ship flying a black flag . The pirate ship had sailed up
next to the king’s boat .

The king and the eleven knights were not prepared
to fight . The knights did not have their swords or
shields with them .



62


63


“I will count to ten,” shouted the pirate chief . “If
you do not hand over the king and his boat by then,
we will attack! We do not care to harm you, but if we
must, then we must!”

The pirate chief began to count, “One, two . . . um .”
He hesitated . (Pirates aren’t good at math!)

“Three,” came a voice from below . It was Sir Gus .
He was lying down below the deck, and he was feeling
very ill .

Sir Gus was so ill that he had no idea what was
happening . The strong winds had kept him from
hearing what the pirate chief had said . All he could
make out was the sound of someone counting .

“Thank you,” said the pirate chief . He went on
counting . “Seven, eight, nine . . .”

“Uuuuuug! Ooooooe!” came a loud and scary
sound from inside King Alfred’s boat .



64


65


“Uuuuuug! Ooooooe!”

“What is that hideous sound?” yelled the pirate .

“It is the ghost of our last king, and it protects our
ship!” replied Sir Tom .

Sir Tom was well aware that, in fact, the hideous
sound was coming from Sir Gus, who was feeling very
sick indeed, but he was hoping to scare the pirates away
with a ghost story .

“Uuuuuug! Ooooooe!” came the sound again .

“If you harm the king,” Sir Tom shouted, “you will
be haunted by this evil, vengeful ghost! I will count to
ten, and you had better go away, you thief! The ghost
would rather not harm you, but if it must, then it
must .”

Pirates are very afraid of ghosts . And so, within
seconds, the pirate ship began to sail away .




67


Not long after, the clouds cleared and the waves
died down . Sir Gus felt some relief and came limping
back up on deck .

“Well done, Sir Gus!” said the king . “You scared
those evil pirates away by pretending to be a ghost .”

“I did?” said Sir Gus, still looking rather green in
the face .

“Why, yes!” said the king . “Such a clever and
helpful trick! How can I ever repay you for your
wisdom and bravery? Perhaps I should award you a
medal?”

“Your majesty,” said Sir Gus, “the best payment of
all would be if you would order the captain to sail this
boat back to land . I find the nautical life not to agree
with me .”

And with that, the king’s boat sailed for home .



68


69


## **Chapter 8**
### **The Letter**

The story of how Sir Gus saved the king from
pirates traveled across the land . People began to tell
tales of Brave Sir Gus .

The king thanked his knights and gave them
presents . Sir Gus was given a shiny medal and a silver
cup . Then, after several parties at the palace, the
knights went back to their homes .

The kingdom remained peaceful and calm for
several months . Then one day, the king was given a
letter that told of danger .



70


71


The King summoned his knights to the palace . Just
as before, eleven of the twelve knights arrived at once .
However, it was several days before Sir Gus the Utterly
Fearless appeared, looking dazed and dented .

“I am glad to see that you have arrived at last,” said
the king .

Sir Gus knelt down .

“Your majesty, I apologize for my late arrival . I had
a nasty run-in with a llama near the Old Stone Bridge,”
explained the knight .

“A llama?” exclaimed the king . “I didn’t know that
we had llamas in our kingdom .”

“Indeed, nor did I, your majesty,” replied Sir Gus .



72


knights .



74


## **Chapter 9**

The next morning, long after everyone else had
eaten their morning meal, Sir Gus awoke, much rested
but not eager to set off . He yawned . He stretched . He
took a bath . He had lunch . At last, he mounted his
horse . But he soon faced another problem: he could
not tell which way was east .

Sir Gus could seldom tell which way to travel . He
rarely saw the morning sun, so he did not know that it
rose in the east . But knowing that he did indeed need
to begin, he sniffed the afternoon air, flipped a coin,
and rode north .

Sir Gus rode north into the Woods of Doom . He
rode for a week . The days got shorter and colder . Sir
Gus did not know why .

Another thing Sir Gus did not know was that the
Woods of Doom were very dangerous . So he was not
prepared when, from out of nowhere, there appeared
a band of armed men . The men were bandits . They
grabbed Sir Gus and tied him up .



76


77


The bandits bundled Sir Gus into the back of a
wagon . Then, with much speed, they began to travel
southeast .

About a week later, the bandits arrived at the
Bleak Forest of the East . There, not far from the Dark
Dismal Swamp, they made camp . The bandits had
some dinner and went to sleep .

The next morning, while the bandits were still
sleeping, something deep inside the forest began to
creep closer to their camp . It was the fearsome beast .
It had eyes of red flame . It had claws that could shred
the hardest stone . It shot fiery flames that could melt
metal . And it was going to pounce on the sleeping
men .

Sir Gus had relaxed for the better part of a week as
he bumped along in the wagon . He was feeling well
rested . So, in spite of the fact that it was morning, and
in spite of the fact that his arms were tied, he decided
to try to get up .



78


79


After a long struggle, Gus was able to stand up
in the wagon . Just as he stood up, the fearsome beast
grunted and charged in to attack . Sir Gus spun around
as best he could to see what had made the sound . The
bright morning sun shone on his shiny helmet . The
sunlight bounced off his helmet and shone on the
fearsome beast .

The flash of sunlight shone in the eyes of the
fearsome beast and blinded it . The beast screamed and
ran away . But it could not see . It ran into the Dark
Dismal Swamp and sank in the deep mud .

The bandits, having woken with a start, fled as well .
They scrambled into the wagon and drove away as
quickly as they could . As they drove off, Gus fell out of
the wagon . He landed on the ground with a thud .




81


Sir Gus the Utterly Fearless lay on the ground for
two days, unable to get up . At last a hunter spotted
him and untied him .

Sir Gus thanked the hunter . Then he made his way
back to the king’s palace on foot .

When he arrived, the king was just sitting down for
his dinner . Sir Gus knelt and spoke to him .

“Your majesty,” he said, “I am happy to report
that the fearsome beast lies at the bottom of the Dark
Dismal Swamp .”

“Well done, Sir Gus!” said the king . “Well done!”

The king called all his knights to a meeting .

“Sir Gus has killed the fearsome beast and tossed
its carcass into the Dark Dismal Swamp,” the king
announced . “Thanks to his brave actions, the kingdom
is safe . You may all go home .”



82


83


Six months passed until King Alfred saw his
knights . This time he did not need their help, but he
asked them to come to his birthday party . The king had
asked 500 people to join him . He had made plans for
a large feast, as well as jousting, magic, and dancing .
Everyone was very excited .

The palace was filled with five thousand candles .
Gold cloth was draped on the walls . King Alfred had
planned a treat for everyone . Just as the jousting was
about to begin, a thousand white doves were to be
released into the sky above the palace .

King Alfred asked King Henry, the king of another
kingdom, to attend the birthday party . The twelve
knights were coming, too . King Henry’s knights were
going to challenge King Alfred’s knights in jousting .
The winners would get 100 gold coins each .



84


85


his knights .


your skill .”


said Sir Pete .


cry!”


and fall off his horse .


The knights began to file out .



86


87


“Yes, Sire .”

“Do you see how the royal baker made a tiny king
out of icing that looks just like me?”

“Yes, Sire .”

“It is a wonderful birthday present! But the best
present of all will be seeing you defeat Sir Ivan the
Black Knight in the jousting .”

“Sir Ivan?” asked Sir Gus nervously .

“Yes,” said the king . “He has made quite a fearsome
name for himself . But I trust you will beat him .”

Sir Gus was too scared to speak .

“Well, then,” said the king . “Off you go! And happy
birthday to me!”



88


89


## **Chapter 11**
### **The Joust**

When all of the nobles and knights were assembled
in the arena, King Alfred stood up . He welcomed King
Henry, who was seated next to him . Then he gave the
command to release the doves .

At once a spectacle of white birds rose up into the
clear, cloudless sky . The people gasped . Then they




91


Sir Ed rode out . He was dressed like a knight
prepared for battle . His horse was draped in red, as
King Alfred had requested .

His opponent was a knight called Sir Basil . Sir
Basil’s horse was draped in gold .

Sir Ed smiled at the cheering crowd . When King
Alfred gave the command, the jousting began . The rival
knights held their lances . Then they charged at each
other . Within seconds Sir Ed had knocked Sir Basil to
the ground . The crowd stood up and clapped loudly .



92


93


Next to enter the arena was Sir Gus . He rode in on
the king’s horse .

His opponent was Sir Ivan . Sir Ivan was known
to be a very fearsome knight . He was called the Black
Knight because both he and his horse dressed mostly in
black .

Sir Gus and his horse faced the Black Knight . Sir
Gus was hoping that he would not begin to itch . He
was hoping he would not faint . When the king gave the
command, Sir Gus picked up his lance, closed his eyes,
and charged at Sir Ivan .

With one blow from the Black Knight’s lance,
Sir Gus was knocked off his horse . He landed on the
ground with a thud . His helmet rolled off to one side .
The crowd gasped . They waited for their hero, Sir Gus
the Utterly Fearless, to get up . But Sir Gus did not get
up . He was knocked out, which is just as well really,
because what happened next would have scared him
to death .



94


97


You see, King Henry was only pretending to be a
good king . In fact, he was a very wicked king . With the
help of his wizard and his knights, he hoped to take
over King Alfred’s kingdom .

King Henry spoke to the Black Knight . He told
him to carry King Alfred to the dungeon below the
palace . Then King Henry went to say thank you to his
wizard .

“Good job, Albert! Well done!” said King Henry .
“How long will this spell of yours last?”

“It will last for 100 years,” replied Albert, “unless
someone finds out how to undo it, and that is very
unlikely .”

“You see,” the wizard explained in a whisper, “there
is only one thing that can break the spell and wake
everyone up . The web of a female garden spider must
be rubbed into King Alfred’s left hand . And, as only
you and I know the secret, your majesty, it is not going
to happen .”

King Henry smiled an evil smile and patted his
wizard on the back .



98


99


“You are a clever wizard,” the king said . “I will see
to it that you become very rich . But at the moment I
must summon my army . The troops are waiting in the
king’s forest, just west of here . As soon as they hear
from me, they will attack .”

The king pointed at Sir Gus, who was lying on the
ground . “Because Sir Gus and the rest of King Alfred’s
knights are asleep, no one can stop us . We will win
easily! Meanwhile, let us go and find out how much
gold and silver King Alfred keeps in his palace!”

And with that, the king and his wizard left the
arena .



100


101


## **Chapter 13**
### **Breaking the Spell**

Sir Gus awoke to the sound of doves cooing in his
ears . He felt the birds rubbing against his chin . Luckily
for him, he was asleep when Albert the Wizard cast his
spell . Because he was asleep, Sir Gus was not affected
by the spell . The doves that were released when the
jousting began had come back to the arena and woken
him up .

Sir Gus rubbed his eyes . He lifted himself up off the
ground . Then he dusted himself off and looked around .
He could not quite believe what he saw . The hundreds
of people who were clapping and cheering were now
fast asleep—all of them!



102


103


Just then Sir Gus saw the Black Knight ride past .
The Black Knight was carrying a sleeping King Alfred
away on his horse .

Sir Gus followed the Black Knight . He saw him
carry the king down the steps that led to the palace
dungeon .

Sir Gus was confused .

“Goodness, what is happening?” he said to himself .



104


105


Sir Gus crept down into the dungeon to look for
the king . It was very cold and dark in the dungeon .
Sir Gus did not like it one bit . He grabbed a torch to
help him see in the dark .

The torch made things even scarier, for it let Sir
Gus see all of the scary things in the dungeon . He
saw water dripping down from the damp walls . He
saw puddles . He saw mice and rats running back and
forth . Sir Gus shivered . He did not like mice . Nor
was he fond of rats .

The dungeon was filled with cobwebs and scary
spiders . The sight of the spiders made Sir Gus
tremble and shake .



106


107


Sir Gus made his way past lots of cobwebs . In the
end he found King Alfred asleep in a tiny cell .

Sir Gus went into the cell . A bat swooped from
one dark corner to another . Sir Gus was afraid of bats .
He jumped with fright and ran over to the king . The
terrified knight reached for the king’s left hand . As
Sir Gus grabbed it, several strands from the web of a
female garden spider were rubbed into the king’s left
hand . Instantly the king awoke .



108


109


astonished King Alfred, as he got up .

“Your majesty,” said Sir Gus, “pardon me, but I
am not quite sure . It seems that King Henry and his
knights did not come as friends, for I saw the Black
Knight place you in this dungeon .”

Sir Gus tried to explain as best he could what had
happened . However, he could not explain why he had
woken up in the jousting arena to find everyone else
asleep .

“How are you feeling?” asked the king, recalling
that Sir Gus had fallen from his horse in the joust .

“Well, I am still standing,” replied Sir Gus .

“We had better get out of here and find out what is
happening,” said the king .

“Yes,” said Sir Gus . “By all means . We must find out
what is happening .” But, deep down, Sir Gus was not
sure he really cared to find out what was happening .



110


111


Slowly Sir Gus and the king crept out of the dark
dungeon . They set off to find King Alfred’s knights .

At the same time the king woke up, so did
everyone in the palace and the arena . People began to
realize someone had betrayed King Alfred .

It wasn’t long before King Alfred and Sir Gus
found the other knights in the palace .



112


113


“Your majesty, I rejoice to find you well,” said Sir
Tom as he knelt and kissed the king’s ring . “We feared
King Henry had taken you from us . It seems he was
planning to take over your kingdom .”

“Yes, I am alive, all thanks to Sir Gus,” explained
the king . “He found me in the palace dungeon . I
am still not sure why he found me asleep in my own
dungeon .”

“That is easy to explain,” said Sir Tom . “King
Henry’s wizard cast a spell that made everyone fall
asleep . It would seem that somehow the spell did not
harm Sir Gus, and he was able to wake you up .”

“In fact, everyone has woken up,” said Sir Ed .

“What about King Henry and his knights?” asked
King Alfred . “Where are they?”



114


115


“Do not fear, your majesty,” said Sir Ed . “We will
find King Henry and his knights, and we will see that
they are punished for what they have done .”

King Alfred’s knights looked high and low, and
in every corner, for King Henry and his knights . But
they were nowhere to be found . Somehow they had all
managed to escape .

But at least King Alfred was safe .



116


117


### **Revenge**

For a while, King Alfred was very sad . King Henry,
his friend, had betrayed him . How could he?

Then King Alfred got mad . King Henry, his friend,
had betrayed him! How dare he?

When you are a king, you must show your enemies
how brave and strong you are . Kings don’t do this
themselves, as that would be dangerous . They send
an army to do it for them . And that is just what King
Alfred decided to do .



118


119


arrived on time .

“Sit down,” said the king . “I have something
important to tell you .”

“We are here to serve you,” said Sir Tom as, one by
one, the knights sat down at a long table .

“I know I have told you how much your bravery
means to me,” said the king . “I think you are the most
excellent knights my kingdom has ever seen, or indeed
may ever see .”

“Thank you, your majesty,” said Sir Ed .

“We rejoice to serve you,” said Sir Tom .



120


121


“I have decided,” explained the king, “that our
kingdom must fight King Henry’s kingdom . We must
strike back! We must punish him for his treason and
evil deeds!”

“If I may say so,” said Sir Ed, “that is an excellent
idea!”

“Indeed!” said Sir Tom . “We should show him who’s
boss around here!”

“Just what I was thinking,” replied the king, “and
that is why I have decided to send an army to fight
against King Henry’s army . I won’t lead the army
myself, you know .”

“No, indeed not,” agreed Sir Tom . “That would
be silly .”

“Yes, very silly indeed,” said the king with a smile .
“No, our most respected knight, the leader among
leaders, the fighter among fighters, will lead the army .
My other brave knights will assist him .”



122


123


Eleven of the twelve knights looked at each other
eagerly . Each of them was hoping that the king was
going to pick him to lead the army . As the king was
about to say which knight he had picked, Sir Gus fell
off his chair .

The reason for his fall is easy to explain . That
afternoon, after eating a large lunch, Sir Gus went to sit
in the king’s rose garden . It was there that he was stung
by a bee . The bee had stung him on the bottom, and he
was finding it very difficult to sit down . In the end, the
pain was too much for him . He fell off his chair and
landed in front of the king .



124


126


127


Sir Gus was stunned .

“Me?” he mumbled .

“Yes, you!” shouted all eleven knights together .

Sir Tom reached for a map of King Henry’s
kingdom .

“You will need this,” said Sir Tom . He was feeling
a little sad that King Alfred had not chosen him, but
what could he do?



128


129


“This map shows all of the hills, rivers, and valleys
in King Henry’s kingdom,” Sir Tom explained .

“Thank you,” said Sir Gus . He did not understand
why he would need a map that showed hills, rivers,
and valleys, unless it was to point out the best places to
hide . Still, he took the map and pretended to look at it .

“Sir Gus,” said Sir Tom, “you are holding the map
upside down .”

“Am I?” said Sir Gus . Then he added, “Yes, I am .
You see, I am trying to get a sense of how things might
look from the enemy’s position .”



130


131


“What is your plan?” asked Sir Ed . Like Sir Tom, he
was sad that he was not chosen to lead the attack . But
there was not much he could do about it . “Do you plan
a sudden attack at night with some of the army, or an
all-out attack at sunrise with the entire army?”

“Sunrise?” said Sir Gus . “That is in the morning .
No, I think the attack at night is a much better plan . If
you like, Sir Ed, you could lead the sudden attack, and
I could stay with the rest of the army and keep them
safe .”

“I could not take this moment of glory away from
you,” said Sir Ed . “It would not be fair .”

“Sure, you can,” replied Sir Gus . “I mean, you must
not feel bad . I have other plans up my sleeve—plans
that will soon be revealed .”

“Well, if you really don’t mind,” said Sir Ed, “I
would be delighted .”

Sir Ed was starting to feel much happier about
everything .

“I have just one request,” said Sir Ed .



132


133


“Yes,” said Sir Gus . “What is it?”

“The Black Knight and his men are camped in the
Fields of the West,” explained Sir Ed . “I would like to
attack them there . And I would like to take Sir Tom
with me . He can lead our knights in battle, while I lead
our foot troops .”

“I was just about to say the very same thing,”
announced Sir Gus .

“Wonderful!” said Sir Ed . “Excellent!”

“Splendid!” said Sir Tom . “Fantastic!”

By this point, Sir Tom and Sir Ed were both feeling
a lot happier .

“It seems we have a good plan,” said Sir Tom . “We
will go and get the horses .”

“Good idea,” said Sir Gus . “I will stay here and
make sure the rest of the army stays safe .”

Eleven of the knights went off to prepare for battle .
Sir Gus went off to find someone who could stop the
awful pain he was feeling in his bottom .



134


135


## **Chapter 17**
### **Marching Orders**

The next morning, the knight known as Sir Doug
arrived at the palace . He found Sir Gus in the king’s
kitchen cooking eggs and bacon .

“Good morning!” said a cheery Sir Gus .

“Sir Gus,” cried Sir Doug, “Sir Tom and Sir Ed
need your help!”

“They do?” said Sir Gus, who was beginning to
suspect that there would be no time to eat breakfast .

“Yes!” replied Sir Doug . “Their sudden night attack
in the Fields of the West did not go well . They were
engaged in fierce fighting with the Black Knight . They
have battled all night . They sent me to beg you to come
with the rest of the army and save them! Sir Gus, the
rest of the army is awaiting your command .”

“Yes, indeed, my command,” replied Sir Gus,
knowing that he must go at once . “Go and saddle the
horses! We will ride at once!”



136


137


A little while later, Sir Gus appeared in front of the
king’s palace . He was dressed for battle and holding the
map Sir Tom had given him .

“My friends,” Sir Gus announced, “we will ride
south, until we get to the Old Stone Bridge . Then we
will use the bridge to cross the Misty River and enter
King Henry’s kingdom .”

Sir Doug and the rest of the men looked puzzled .

“But, Sir Gus,” said Sir Doug, “the Old Stone
Bridge is north of here, not south .”

“Is it?” said Sir Gus . “Then we will ride north .”

men rode north .



140


141


## **Chapter 18**

Sir Gus and his men rode north . They reached the
Old Stone Bridge just as the sun began to set . There
they rested .

Meanwhile the Black Knight waited in the Fields
of the West . He had taken Sir Tom and Sir Ed
prisoner . He was sure King Alfred would send the rest
of his army to try to free them . He was sure that King
Alfred’s army would come charging across the shallow

and let him decide what to do with you .”


They felt the fighting was finished . They took off

expecting what happened next .



144


145


Sir Gus and his men charged at them . This was
as much of a shock for Sir Gus as it was for the Black
Knight . Sir Gus had not expected to find King Henry’s
army quite so easily . He had not expected his men to
charge into battle on their own . But that was what they
did .

When Sir Gus saw that his men were charging, he
shouted, “Charge!” and rode after them .

The Black Knight and his men were not expecting
an attack and they were not prepared . They tried to
fight as best they could . Some of them were able to
grab spears . Others used sticks and stones . However,
it soon became clear that it was no use . The Black
Knight’s men panicked and ran .

King Alfred’s army cheered as they chased the
retreating men .



146


147


When the battle was won, the men cried, “King
Alfred is the greatest king, and Sir Gus is the bravest
knight of all!”

They grabbed Sir Gus and tossed him high in
the air, shouting “Hooray for Sir Gus! Hooray for
Sir Gus!”

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully
leveled in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.


The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many spellings
can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to make early
reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of the available
spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out as part of their
phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been deliberately
introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if they are
assigned at the proper time.


As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.
