**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 6. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. The activity pages in this book
do not include written instructions for students because the instructions would have words that
are not decodable. Teachers will explain these activity pages to the students orally, using the
instructions in the Teacher Guide. The Activity Book is a student component, which means each
student should have an Activity Book.

Below you will find the spelling words for this unit. You will notice that there are twenty
words. Additionally, we are teaching your student to take the next step in alphabetizing by
alphabetizing words to the second letter. We will be working on this skill throughout this
unit. Your student will see the practical application of this skill as we learn to use a glossary
in this unit.


Additionally, in this unit we will introduce nonfiction reading through a series of
American history chapters about the War of 1812. Much later in the unit we will be
learning how to write a research report.

**Trouble with the British**


In 1812, James Madison had a hard choice to make. Many
Americans were angry with the **British** . Some of them were saying
the United States should **declare war** on Great Britain. But others
disagreed. They said the United States should not go to war.

Madison was president of the United States. He had to decide
what to do. Should he ask the **U.S. Congress** to declare war? Or
should he try to keep the **peace** ?

At the time, Great Britain was already at war with France.
The two countries had been fighting for years. Most of the
countries in Europe were involved in the war. Some sided with the
British. Others sided with the French.

The French were led by a man named Napoleon. He was a
brave leader. He had beaten the British in a number of battles.
Still, the British kept fighting.

The United States tried to stay out of this big war. At first,
most Americans did not care to get involved. American **traders**
wished to trade with both Great Britain and France. But this led
to problems.

When U.S. ships traded with the British, the French got
upset. They did not want Americans trading with their enemies.
When U.S. ships traded with the French, the British got upset for
the same reason.

Sometimes British ships would stop American ships to keep
them from trading with the French. Sometimes French ships
would stop American ships to keep them from trading with the
British.

The Americans had problems with both the French and the
British. As time went on, the problems with the British increased.

The British had a strong **army** and an even stronger **navy** .
But serving in the British Navy was a hard job. Some people
quit. Others ran away. This was a problem for the British. They
needed all the men they could get. How else could they **defeat**
the French?


Foundational Skills 6
**29**


**30**



The British spent a lot of time looking for men who had run off. From time to time they
would stop American ships. British officers would come on deck to look for British men. They
would grab men and force them to serve in the British Navy. This was called **impressment** .

The British said they only took British men who had run away. But they were not always
careful. Sometimes they grabbed Americans. Stories about men taken by the British were
printed in the papers. How do you think Americans felt when they read them? They felt
angry. Some of them felt the United States needed to fight back. They said the United States
needed to declare war on Great Britain.

Impressment was one problem. But there were others. Many in the United States were
also upset with the British for trading with Native Americans.

In 1812, most Americans were farmers. At first, most
farmers had homes near the East Coast. But then the
country began to grow. People went west. They settled
in places far from the coast. They set up farms. They
planted crops. There was just one problem: there were
already people living there!

The settlers were moving onto land where Native
Americans hunted and made their homes. Native
Americans did not like this. There were many fights
between settlers and Native Americans.

The British controlled Canada. They sent traders
south from Canada to trade with Native Americans.
These traders sold all sorts of things to Native Americans.

The British said they had a right to trade with Native
Americans. But lots of people in the United States did
not see it that way. They said the British were helping
Native Americans attack American settlers. They felt they
needed to fight back.

You can see there were many reasons for Americans
to be angry with the British. But there were also good
reasons for not declaring war. A war causes death, wrecks
towns, and costs a lot of money. Plus, Americans felt
that the British would not be easy to defeat. President
Madison and the men in Congress would have to think
long and hard about declaring war.

**The War Hawks**


At first, President Madison tried to keep
America out of the war. He tried to make a deal
with the British. He asked them to stop taking
American sailors. He asked them to stop trading
with Native Americans. But he did not ask Congress
to declare war.


This made some people happy. There were
many people in the United States who did not
care to go to war. Most **merchants** and traders felt
this way. They traded with Great Britain, as well
as other countries. A war would mean less trade
between countries. It would mean sunken ships
and lost goods. A war would cost them money. For
this reason, as well as some others, most merchants
**opposed** the war.


But others felt a war was needed. The states
out west, like Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee, were
closer to Native American land. The settlers in these
states were scared of Native Americans. They were
also angry with the British.


These people were called “War Hawks.” They
made loud, angry speeches. They complained about
impressment. They complained that the British
were selling guns to Native Americans. They felt the
United States needed to declare war.


When some War Hawks found out that the
British were selling guns to Native Americans, it
made them angry.

These War Hawks gave President Madison an earful. They got up in Congress
and made angry speeches. They said that the United States should stand up to Great
Britain. They said that Madison should ask Congress to declare war.

**The War Starts**


Presidents have to make hard choices. James
Madison had to decide whether to side with the War
Hawks or with the merchants who hoped for peace.
In the end, he sided with the War Hawks. Madison
asked Congress to declare war. On June 18, 1812, the
United States declared war on Great Britain.

The Americans were in for a hard fight. The
British had a huge army. They also had the world’s
biggest navy. But the British were already at war with
France. They could only send some of their troops
to fight the United States. That was a good thing for
the Americans. It meant that the United States would
have a better chance of winning.

Even so, not a lot of people at the time could
imagine that the United States could win. Today the
United States is a strong nation. It has been around
for many years. It has a strong army and navy. But
that was not the case in 1812.

In 1812, the United States was not very old as a
country. It had broken away from Great Britain only
about 30 years before.

The United States had a different kind of
government, too. At the time, most of the nations
of Europe were **monarchies** . That means they were
ruled by kings or queens. A king or queen would rule
until he or she died. Then, in most cases, the oldest
son would take over. The United States was not a
monarchy. It did not have a king or queen. Instead, it
had a president. The president was chosen by voters.
He did not get to serve until he died. He served for
four years. Then the voters got a chance to pick their
president. If they voted for a different president, the
old one had to step down.


Foundational Skills 6
**59**


**60**



In 1812, most people in the world felt that the American government had a very
strange way of doing things. They were not sure that the system would last and that the
United States would be able to survive.

In 1812, the United States did not have a strong army. In fact, the U.S. Army was
tiny. It had about 4,000 soldiers.

The navy was tiny, too. George Washington, the first president, had set it up. He
didn’t think the United States needed a big navy, but just a small number of ships to
protect merchants from pirates.

President Madison found a way to make the army bigger. He got farmers to join.
Many Americans were farmers. They used guns to hunt and to defend their homes.
Madison called on these farmers. He asked them to grab their guns and join the army.
Farmers were paid money and given land for joining.

The U.S. soldiers were not well trained. Still, Madison was sure they could win if
they attacked the British in Canada. He sent the army north to Canada.

The attack on Canada did not go well. The army lost a string of battles. The
United States lost **forts** along the border. The army was simply not ready for war.

No one expected much from the tiny U.S. Navy. But things went better on the seas
than they did on land. The United States battled bravely. They beat the British in a
number of naval battles.

**A Famous Ship**


The ship on the right is the USS _Constitution_ . It
was one of the ships that battled in the War of 1812.
The letters ‘ _USS’_ stand for _United States Ship_ .

The USS _Constitution_ was named for a very
important **document**, the Constitution of the United
States. The Constitution lays out the laws of the land.
It states what people serving in each **branch** of the
U.S. government can do. It says what the president,
the Congress, and the **Supreme Court** can do—and
also what they cannot do.

James Madison had helped write the Constitution.
He had also played a key role in getting states to
accept it. The people of the United States were proud
of the Constitution, so they named one of their
fighting ships the USS _Constitution_ .

During the War of 1812, the USS _Constitution_
had a **string** of battles on the high seas.

In one battle, the USS _Constitution_ attacked a
British ship. It was a hard fight. The sailors on both
sides fired cannons. The guns blazed and smoked.
The two ships drifted closer. Once they even bumped
into each other.

Cannonballs from the USS _Constitution_ smashed
into the side of the British ship. They made big holes
in it. They ripped off a sail. They knocked down the
ship’s **masts** .

The British ship fired back. But its cannonballs
did less damage to the U.S. ship. In fact, some of
them bounced off the thick walls of the American
ship!


Foundational Skills 6
**73**


When the American sailors saw
this, they cheered.

“Hooray!” one of them shouted.
“Her sides are made of iron!”

In fact, however, the sides of the
ship were not made of iron but of very
thick **planks** of wood. The wooden
sides of the USS _Constitution_ were
much thicker than most ships.

The USS _Constitution_ won
the battle. The British ship was so
smashed up that it could not be fixed.
The British had to sink it.

When people were told about
the battle, they became excited. They
yelled and shouted. They waved
flags and had parties. They treated
the sailors on the USS _Constitution_
as heroes. They also gave the ship
a nickname. They called it “Old
Ironsides” because its wooden sides
seemed as strong as iron.

Old Ironsides kept on fighting. It
battled more than twenty times and
never lost a battle!

**The Attack on**
**Washington, D.C.**


In August of 1814, President Madison was upset. Two years had passed. The war was still
going on. The U.S. Army had won some battles, and it had lost some battles.

The British had landed an army near Washington, D.C. British soldiers were marching.
Madison hoped the U.S. Army would be able to stop them.

At the time, Washington, D.C., was a young town. Some buildings had just been
finished, such as the **Capitol** . Others were not finished yet. Still, it was an important place. It
was where the U.S. Congress met to make laws. It was where the Supreme Court met.

The President’s House was a special house that had been constructed for the president.
(Today it is called the White House.) It was only about ten years old at the time. It was home
to President Madison and his wife, Dolley.

President Madison was aware that there was going to be a big battle outside the city. He
planned to go **support the troops** . He ordered some soldiers to protect Mrs. Madison and the
President’s House. Then he jumped on his horse and rode off.

The battle outside the city did not go well. The U.S. Army was beaten.

People quickly found out about the **defeat** . The army had lost! The British were coming!


Foundational Skills 6
**85**


**86**



People in the city **panicked** . They grabbed their things and ran away. The roads were jammed
with people and carts.

President Madison could not get back to the President’s House. His wife, Dolley, was left
there with servants and soldiers.

The soldiers ran away.

Mrs. Madison could not stay in the President’s House. The British would be there soon.
She had to **flee** .

Mrs. Madison hoped to take as much with her as she could. But which things should
she take? There were many fine things in the President’s House. She loved a lamp that hung
in one room. But there was no way she could take that. It was too heavy. She had a big closet
of fancy dresses. She loved them, too. But there were more important things for her to carry
away.

In the end, Mrs. Madison left most of her own things behind. Instead, she carried away
things that were important to the American people. She grabbed papers and letters. She
stuffed as many of them as she could into a **trunk** .

Mrs. Madison was ready to leave. Then she remembered one last thing. It was a painting
of George Washington. She did not want the painting to fall into the hands of the British.
She called one of President Madison’s trusted servants, Paul Jennings, for help. There was no
time to take the painting gently from its frame. Jennings and the other servants broke the
frame so they could quickly remove the canvas painting. They carefully rolled the canvas like
a tube and carried it away.

“It is done!” said Dolley Madison. Then she ran out the door to safety.

**The Burning of**
**Washington, D.C.**


The British Army marched into Washington,
D.C. The British soldiers were angry because the U.S.
Army had burned York, the capital city of Canada.
They planned to get back at the Americans by
burning the U.S. Capitol Building.


The British soldiers went to the Capitol Building.
This was where the U.S. Congress met. They set
it on fire. Then they marched down the hill to the
President’s House.


The British arrived just after Dolley Madison left.
They broke down the doors and **charged** inside.


The President’s House was empty. In the dining
room, the table had been set for dinner.


The British general sat down with some of
his men. They ate dinner. As a joke, they **toasted**
President Madison. They lifted up their glasses and
thanked him for the meal.


After dinner, the British soldiers started smashing
things. They smashed the dishes. They smashed the
table. They smashed the chairs.


The soldiers ran up and down in the President’s
House looking for things to steal. They took the
spoons and forks. They took the buckles from Mrs.
Madison’s shoes. They even took the love letters her
husband had sent her! The house was **ransacked** .

Then the British general ordered his men to set the house on fire. The soldiers lit
their **torches** . Then they went from room to room. They lit the **drapes** on fire. They
burned the beds. They burned the desks and chairs. They even burned Mrs. Madison’s
dresses.


Then the British marched away. They did not care to take over the city. They just
planned to burn it. Burning the city would be a **heavy blow** . The British hoped the
Americans might feel like there was no longer hope and stop fighting.


Later that day a storm rolled in. The rain stopped most of the fires. But it was too
late. Many of the buildings were already lost.


Later in the week, the Madisons came home. The President’s House was still
standing. But it was a mess. The walls were black with **soot** . The windows were broken.
All of their things had been stolen or burned. They felt they would never call the
President’s House home again.

**The Attack on Baltimore**


Washington, D.C., took ten years to construct. It
took less than one day to destroy it.

Next, the British planned to attack Baltimore.
Baltimore was a big city north of Washington, D.C.
At the time, it was the third largest city in the United
States. It was also a key **port** .

Baltimore was protected from naval attack by a
large fort. It was called Fort McHenry.

The British focused on Fort McHenry. They
hoped that if they could take the fort, they could take
the city. They planned to attack the fort by land and
also by sea.

The people of the city were aware an attack was
coming. They got ready. They **piled up** supplies. They
set up walls. They even sank ships in the **harbor** to
keep the British ships from getting too close to the
city. All of the people in the city **pitched in** . Even the
children helped.

A year earlier, the soldiers in Fort McHenry felt
like they needed a flag they could fly over the fort.
They asked a local woman named Mary Pickersgill
to make a flag. “Make it big,” they told her. “Make it
so big that the British will be able to see it from miles
away!”

The U.S. flag is covered with stars and stripes.
Today, the United States flag has fifty stars and
thirteen stripes. Each star stands for one of the fifty
states of the United States. Each stripe stands for one
of the thirteen original colonies. Sometimes America’s
flag is referred to as “the stars and stripes.”

**104**



The flag that Mary Pickersgill made for Fort McHenry was different. It had fifteen
stars and fifteen stripes.

The Fort McHenry flag was different in another way, too. It was huge! Each star
was two feet across. Each stripe was two feet tall and forty-two feet long.

Mrs. Pickersgill could not do all the **stitching** herself. The flag was too big. She
needed help. She got her daughter to help her. But she still needed more help. She had
her servants help with the stitching. Still she needed more help. She sent for two of her
**nieces** . That did the trick. She and her five helpers stitched day and night until the flag
was finished.

When it was done, the flag was as large as a house. It was hung on a giant pole over
the fort. You could see it from miles away.

The British arrived later in the week. They sent troops to attack the city. But
this time the U.S. soldiers were ready. They stopped the British Army. The British
**commander** was killed during the attack.

The British went back to their ships. They decided to attack Fort McHenry with
their navy instead.

**Francis Scott Key**
**and the National Anthem**


On September 13, 1814, British ships **opened fire** on
Fort McHenry. They fired **rockets** and **mortars** .

The soldiers in the fort would have fired back, but
there was not much point. The guns in the fort were old.
They could not hit the British ships.

The British ships kept firing for a long time. They
fired all day. They fired on into the night.

An American named Francis Scott Key watched the
British attack. He was on a boat in the harbor. Key was
not a soldier. He did not fight in the battle. But he was
able to see it. He could see the British ships blasting away.
He could see Fort McHenry. He could also see the huge
flag Mrs. Pickersgill had made.

Key kept his eye on the American flag. As long as
the flag was still flying at the fort, America was still in
the battle. It meant that the troops in Fort McHenry had
not given up. If the flag went down, that would mean
America was no longer fighting. That would mean that
the troops in the fort had given up.

Key watched all day. He was still watching when the
sun set. He was proud that the flag was still flying.

At night it was harder for Key to see. But there were
flashes of light. Sometimes a rocket would go **streaking**
through the darkness. Sometimes a bomb would explode
and light up the sky. The flashes of light allowed Key to
see the flag.

The firing went on until just before dawn. Then it
stopped. The sun had not come up yet. It was still dark.
There were no rockets blasting. There were no bombs
bursting in the air. Key could not see much. The silence



**Take-Home**
##### 21.4



Foundational Skills 6
**117**


**118**



was puzzling. What did it mean? Was the battle over? Had the soldiers in the fort given up?
Key could not tell.

Key waited nervously. At last the sun rose. Key looked at the fort. And what did he see?
The soldiers had raised the huge flag that Mrs. Pickersgill had made. It was not the U.S.
soldiers who had given up. It was the British sailors! They had stopped firing on the fort.

Key felt a surge of joy. He felt pride, too. The brave men in the fort had not given up!

Key felt **inspired** . He hoped to share with others what he had seen. He needed to tell
what it was like to wait and wait—and then see the flag still flying in the morning. Key
reached into his pocket. He found an old letter. On the back, he wrote a poem. Here is the
first part of his poem:


_O say can you see by the dawn’s early light_


_What so proudly we_ _**hailed**_ _at the twilight’s last gleaming?_


_Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the_ _**perilous**_ _fight,_


_O’er the_ _**ramparts**_ _we watched were so_ _**gallantly**_ _streaming?_


_And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,_


_Gave_ _**proof**_ _through the night that our flag was still there._


_O say does that Star-Spangled Banner yet wave_


_O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?_


Key did not know then that, one day, his poem would become our **national anthem** .

After the Battle of Baltimore, both sides began to get
tired of the war. They called a meeting. Men from both
sides sat down to try to form a **peace treaty** . But in the
meantime, the war went on.

The British sent troops to attack the city of New
Orleans, on the Gulf of Mexico.

You can see why New Orleans is an important place
if you look at a map. The city is located at the **mouth** of
the Mississippi River, right where the river drains into the
Gulf of Mexico. From New Orleans you can travel north
along the Mississippi River. You can also turn off onto
other rivers that feed into the Mississippi, like the Ohio
River. These rivers are like highways that lead right into
the middle of North America.

In 1814, New Orleans was already an important,
big port. Lots of ships landed there. Farmers could ship
their goods down the river and sell them in New Orleans.
Traders could unload goods in New Orleans and ship
them up the river. New Orleans was an important city, not
only for the people who had homes there, but also for the
farmers up the river in places like Ohio and Kentucky.

If the British took New Orleans, they could control
trade along the Mississippi. Farmers in Ohio and Kentucky
would be cut off. The Americans could not let this happen.
They sent an army to defend the city. The army was led by
a man named Andrew Jackson.

Andrew Jackson was from Tennessee. He had joined
the U.S. Army during the American Revolution. At the
time he was just a boy. He was too young to fight. He
carried notes from place to place for soldiers.

During the Revolution, Jackson and his brother were
taken prisoner by the British. It was a difficult time for
them. They were treated badly. They almost starved to
death. Jackson’s brother got sick and died.

While he was a prisoner, Jackson had a run-in with a British officer. The man ordered
Jackson to clean his boots. Jackson was proud and stubborn. He refused. The man shouted at
Jackson. Still Jackson refused. The man struck Jackson with his weapon. Jackson was left with
a scar on his face.

As a result of this, Andrew Jackson had no love for the British. He was happy to fight
them again as an army **general** when the War of 1812 broke out.

Jackson had not been trained as a soldier. But he was bold and strong. His mother had
died when he was young. He had gotten by on his own as an **orphan** . He had made his own
way in life.

During the first part of the War of 1812, Jackson battled against Native Americans in the
west. Many Native Americans had sided with the British.

Jackson’s men called him “Old **Hickory** ” because he was as strong as a **knotty** old piece
of hickory wood. In 1814, “Old Hickory” was given an important job. He was told to raise
an army to protect New Orleans. Jackson rushed to the city. He picked up new troops along
the way. Many of the men who joined him were farmers. But there were also free African
Americans, Native Americans, and even pirates. When Jackson arrived, he ordered his **ragtag**
army to set up walls and get ready for an attack. Then they waited.

**The End of the War**


On January 8, 1815, the British attacked New
Orleans. They planned on winning without much
trouble. But they did not know how brave Andrew
Jackson and his men were—or how good they were
with their weapons.


The British soldiers had on bright red coats. A
wave of them charged. Jackson’s men crouched behind
their walls. They took careful aim. Then they fired.
Their bullets hit the first wave of British soldiers.


The British kept coming. Jackson and his men
kept firing. The wall helped to keep them safe. When
it was all over, the U.S. flag was still flying. The
British gave up their attack.


The British took heavy losses. Two thousand of
their men were killed or hurt. The U.S. Army lost no
more than one hundred men. New Orleans was safe!
Americans cheered for Andrew Jackson and the Battle
of New Orleans.


After time passed, a letter arrived. It said that the
war was already over. On December 24, 1814, the
United States and Great Britain had signed a treaty to
end the war. This was two weeks before the Battle of
New Orleans! But Jackson and his men did not know
that.


In those days news traveled slowly. There were no
radios or television sets. There were no phones. There
were no computers to send emails. A letter could
only travel as fast as the man who carried it. It took

**Take-Home**
##### 26.3

**156**



a couple of weeks for news of the treaty to get from Europe to the United States. That
is why Jackson and his men did not find out about the treaty until after the battle.
America’s greatest victory in the War of 1812 came after the war was already over!


The War of 1812 lasted three years. It’s hard to say who won. Both sides won
battles. The British burned Washington, D.C. But the Americans won the Battle of
New Orleans. “Old Ironsides” won a number of battles on the sea. But other U.S. ships
were sunk. All in all, there was no clear winner.


It might seem as if the war was for nothing. But some things had changed. The
Americans had battled together as a nation, and they had done it well. They had taken
on the mighty British and had held their own. The world saw they were strong.


The end of the war marked the start of a new age in U.S. history. It was an age of
national pride. The War of 1812 showed that the United States of America was here to
stay.

managed to keep fighting. It was never defeated in any battle during
the war. You can still visit the USS _Constitution_ today in Boston where
it is in the harbor.

**The Young Mouse**


Once upon a time there was a young mouse who had never left his


mother’s side. One day the young mouse went outside for a walk


to explore. But it was not long until he came running back to his


mother.


“Mother! Mother!” said the young mouse. “What a scare I have had!


I was walking along when I saw two strange animals. One of them


looked a lot like me. She had paws and a tail. She looked soft, and


kind, and graceful.


“But the other one was a scary monster! You should have seen him!


He had just two legs and scratched at the ground with his claws. He


kept beating his arms. He was ugly, too. He had no fur, just feathers,


and he had big red flaps hanging from his head and neck. But what


scared me the most was the awful sound he made. It sounded like


cock-a-doodle-doo!”

The young mouse went on. “I wanted to say hello to the nice animal


that looked like me. She was so lovely, and she looked so good and


gentle. She had thick, glossy hair and a modest face. As she looked at


me, she waved her fine, long tail and smiled. I think she was about


to speak to me when the other animal let out his awful scream. I was


so scared that I ran for my life. I didn’t even have time to smile back


at the nice animal. It is such a shame. I would have liked to meet


that lovely animal.”


“My son,” said the mother, “the animal that scared you was a


rooster. He may look and sound scary, but he would never harm


you. The other animal that you saw was a cat. She may look good


and gentle, but she is no pal of ours. She would gladly eat you and


your mice pals. In fact, she would have eaten you if you had not run


away. So be thankful, my son, that you escaped with your life. Stay


close to me and remember that things are not always what they seem


to be.”

**Our National Anthem**


A national anthem is a special **patriotic** song. Many countries have a national anthem.
People sing a national anthem to show that they are proud of their country.

In the United States, our national anthem is “The Star-Spangled Banner.” The words to
this song were written by Francis Scott Key during the War of 1812. The song describes what
Key saw during the attack on Fort McHenry.

After the attack, he saw the U.S. flag, or in his words, the “star-spangled banner.”

We sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” before baseball games and other sporting events.
We sing it on holidays like the Fourth of July. We sing it on special days when we gather
together. Sometimes we sing it at school. We sing it to show that we care about our country.

In the United States, we always stand when we sing or hear the national anthem. If you
are playing or talking and you hear this song, you should stop what you are doing and turn to
face a flag. You may wish to place your right hand over your heart. You should stand still and
look at the flag until the song is over. You should never talk or giggle or fool around during
the national anthem.

During the national anthem, you will see men taking off their hats. You may also see
soldiers **saluting** the flag. They salute by bringing their right hand up to their head or the
tip of their hat. Also, the flag should never touch the ground. These are all ways of showing
respect for the U.S. flag and pride in our country.

You know that “The Star-Spangled Banner” was written by Francis Scott Key. But did


Foundational Skills 6
**213**


**214**



you know that it was not always our national anthem? In fact, it took more than one hundred
years for it to become our national anthem.

When it was first written, “The Star-Spangled Banner” was not a song. It was a poem.
A little later, people took the words and set them to music. They sang the words to a tune
that was popular at the time. Do you ever change the words to songs you know? That’s what
people did with “The Star-Spangled Banner.” They took an old tune and gave it different
words.

Soon, lots of people were singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.” It was a big hit!

“The Star-Spangled Banner” became a popular national song. People all over the nation
liked to sing it. But they also liked to sing lots of other songs, and we still sing some of them
today. Do you know “Yankee Doodle?” What about “My Country, ’Tis of Thee?” Have you
ever sung “America, the Beautiful?” These are all patriotic songs that we sing to show how we
feel about our country.

If you went to a big **state dinner** at the White House one hundred years ago, the band
might have played “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Or it might have played “Yankee Doodle,” or
“My Country, ’Tis of Thee.” At that time, the United States did not have a national anthem.
It had a set of national songs. Then, in 1931, Congress made “The Star-Spangled Banner” the
national anthem.

“The Star-Spangled Banner” is sung to show that we love our country. It is one of the
things that unite us as a people. So when you sing it, sing it with pride!

**Making Sense of the**
**National Anthem**


Francis Scott Key wrote “The Star-Spangled Banner” almost
two hundred years ago. There are some old words in the poem.
Some parts can be hard to understand. Let’s look at the words and
try to make sense of them.

On the next page is the first verse of the song, the part that
we sing before a sporting event. Can you read it two or three
times?

“O’er” is a short form of the word _over_ .
To make sense of the “The Star-Spangled Banner,” it helps
to think of what Francis Scott Key was doing the night he wrote
it. Key was watching the attack on Fort McHenry. In the poem
he describes the attack as a “perilous fight.” That means it was a
dangerous battle.

During the battle, Key kept his eye on Fort McHenry. In the
poem he mentions the ramparts, or walls, of the fort. But what
Key talks about the most is the U.S. flag that he could see flying
over the fort.

Key says the flag is “spangled,” or dotted, with stars. He
also talks about its “broad stripes.” When the wind blows, Key
says these stripes blow back and forth. They look like they are
“streaming” or rippling in the air. Have you ever seen a flag look
that way?

In the poem, Key describes three different times when he
looked for the flag. First, he tells us he looked for the flag at “the
twilight’s last gleaming,” or just as the sun set. Since it was not
dark yet, Key could see. He saw that the flag was still flying over
the fort. That was good. It means that the troops had not given
up.

Key tells us he also looked for the flag at night. You might
think he would not be able to see much at night. But Key explains
that the “rocket’s red glare” and the “bombs bursting in air” lit
up the night sky. These flashes of light helped him see. They gave
him “proof” that the flag was still flying.

Key looked for the flag again just before dawn. This time
he could not see it. Remember, the attack on the fort had stopped
just before dawn. There were no more “bombs bursting in air.”
There was no more “rocket’s red glare.” It was dark. Was the flag

**216**



still flying? Had the troops in the fort given up? Or had the British? In the time before the sun rose,
Key did not know. At that time, he had a lot of questions, but not a lot of answers.

Look back at the words Key wrote. Do you see the question marks? There are three of them. An
important thing to understand about our national anthem is that it starts with a set of questions.

In the first lines, Key asks a question:
“O say can you see by the dawn’s early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming?”
Wow! That’s a long sentence. Suppose we broke it up into shorter sentences and used simpler
words. Then it might sound like this: “The sun is coming up. Tell me, my friend, can you see the
flag? Remember? We saw it last night at sunset. Now the night has passed. Is it still there?”

In the last lines of the song, Key asks another question. He says,
“O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?”
The “star-spangled banner” is the American flag. “The land of the free and the home of the
brave” is what Key calls his country. It’s another name for the United States. So Key is really asking
the same thing he asked before. He is asking, “Is our flag still waving?”

Key asks these questions, but it might seem like he never answers them. In fact, he does. If you
ever get a chance to read the rest of the poem, you will see that Key answers his own questions a little
later. There is a part later in the poem where he says, “Yes! The flag is still flying! Hooray!” But that
is in a part of the poem that we don’t sing very much. Most of the time we only sing the part with the
questions. We don’t sing the part with the answers.

So the next time you sing or hear the national anthem, think of Francis Scott Key. Think of him
watching the bombs bursting over Fort McHenry. Think of him checking on the flag and wondering
if it’s still flying. If you keep your eyes on the flag during the song, you will be doing just what
