### **Mike’s Bedtime**

Mike had his jet plane in his left hand .


“Zip! Zing!” he yelled . “Take that, T . rex!”


Just then, his dad came in and said, “Mike,
it’s bedtime .”



1


“But, Dad,” Mike said, “I’m
seven! Can’t I sit up a bit?”


Mike’s dad said, “Not if the sun
is down and the street lamp is on .
Then, it’s bedtime .”


Mike said, “But, if the street lamp
is off, it’s not bedtime yet!”


Mike ran to check on the lamp
and the sun . He yanked back the
drapes . The sun had set . It was pitch
black . The street lamp was glinting
in the blackness . It was bedtime .



2


3


“I’m not tired”, Mike said . He slumped
and let his chin drop on his chest .


“Bedtime!” said his dad .


Mike limped to his bed and plopped down
on it . He made a face that said, “I wish it was
not bedtime!”



4


Mike’s dad smiled . “What if I tell you a
bedtime tale?” he asked . “Would that help?”


Mike did not think it would help much .
He shrugged .


“When I was a kid,” his dad said, “your
gramp would tell me bedtime tales . I liked
them . I’ll bet I can still tell a lot of them .”



5


“OK,” said Mike, “I would like one
bedtime tale .” Mike’s dad sat down on the
bed and patted Mike on the back of the neck .
“This is a bedtime tale your gramp liked to
tell me,” he said .



6


7


## **The Milk**

Mike’s dad was getting set to tell a
bedtime tale . He said, “The name of
this bedtime tale is ‘The Milk’ .”



8


9


Once upon a time, a lass named Jane set off
from home to sell a bucket of milk .


As she went, she was thinking of the cash she
would get from selling the milk .


“I have big plans . I will sell this milk,” she
said, “and I will use the cash to get a hen . I hope
my hen will make lots of eggs .”


“Then I will sell those eggs and use the cash
to get a cute piglet . I will take care of the piglet
and let him munch on pig slop till he gets nice
and plump .”



10


11


“Then I will sell the pig and get a nice dress
that I can dance in, and . . .”


But just as she was thinking of the dress, she
tripped on a stone and the bucket fell with a
crash . The milk splashed on the path . Jane made
a face and fumed at the spilled milk .


**Moral: Take one step at a time.**



12


13


14


“Is that the end?” asked Mike .


“That’s it,” said his dad .


“What a shame!” said Mike . “She had such
big plans!”


Mike’s dad nodded . “You can make plans,
but planning by itself will not make things
happen .”


Mike sat thinking a bit . Then he said,
“Dad, that bedtime tale was not bad . But it
was sad . Next time would you tell a fun tale?”


“Yes,” said his dad . “Next time .”



15


#### **The Jumping Frog**

“Dad,” Mike said, “you said we could
have a fun bedtime tale this time . Have you
got one that’s fun?”


“Yes,” said his dad . “I’ve got one I think
you will like . It’s a tale my dad used to like
to tell . It takes place in the West a long
time back in the past . The name of the tale
is ‘The Jumping Frog _’_ .”



16


17


Once there was a man named Big Jim who
had a frog .


Big Jim held the frog up and made a speech .
“This is the best jumping frog in the land!” he
said . “This frog has speed . It can jump three feet
at once . You think your frog can jump? I’ll bet he
can’t jump like my frog! In fact, I got ten bucks
says there’s not a frog in the land can jump as fast
as this frog . This frog hops like the wind . This
frog . . .”



18


19


Well, Big Jim would have kept on bragging,
but, just then, a man in a black vest got up and
spoke .


“My name is Pete . I’m not from here,” said
the man . “And I do not have a frog . But if I did,
I would take the bet and race your frog .”


“Well, shucks,” said Big Jim . “That’s not a
problem . Here, take my frog . I’ll run down to
the stream and catch you a frog so we each have a
frog to compete in the race .” Big Jim handed his
frog to Pete . Then he ran off to the stream .



20


21


Mike’s dad was not finished telling the tale,
but Mike had drifted off to sleep . He gave
Mike a kiss and hoped he would have sweet
dreams .



22


23


#### **The Frog Race**

“Dad,” Mike said when he woke up, “what
happened with the jumping frog? I missed the
end of the tale . I was sleeping .”


“I did not tell it to the end,” said his dad .
“When you drifted off to sleep, I stopped .”


“Oh, tell the ending!” said Mike .


Mike’s dad picked up the tale where he had
left off .



24


25


Big Jim handed his frog to Pete and ran off to
the stream .


Pete held Big Jim’s frog in his hand . Pete
looked at the frog . Then Pete reached into his
pocket and got a pile of limes . Yum—Big Jim’s
frog drooled . The frog ate the whole pile of limes
from Pete’s hand! Then Pete set the frog down .


While Pete was feeding the frog limes, Big Jim
was down at the stream . He tossed off his boots
and went frog hunting . At last he nabbed a nice
green frog . He ran back and handed the frog to
Pete .



26


27


“There’s your frog!” said Jim . “Just set him
down there next to my frog . Then we will let
them compete to see which one of them is the
fastest!”


Pete set his frog down .


“All set?” said Jim .


“All set,” said the man .


Then Jim yelled, “Jump, frogs, jump!”



28


29


Pete gave the two frogs a tap to get them
jumping . His frog hopped off nice and quick .
But Jim’s frog just sat there . Once he hitched up
his legs like he was fixing to jump . But it was no
use . With all those limes in him, he was planted
there just as solid as a rock . His tummy was full!


Pete’s frog hopped and hopped till it got to
the finish line .


“Fine race!” said Pete . He took Jim’s ten bucks
and slipped the cash in his pocket . Then Pete
tipped his hat and set off .


Well, Big Jim was stunned . “What happened
to my frog?” he said . “I hope he’s not sick .”


He bent down and picked up the frog and
rubbed his tummy .



30


31


“Goodness!” said Jim . “He must have had a
big lunch!”


“I think Pete tricked me! He fed my frog too
much to eat!” Jim said . Big Jim let out a whoop .
His face got red . Jim ran to catch Pete . But it was
no use . Pete had run off . Pete had tricked Big
Jim!



32


33


#### **The Hare and the Hedgehog**

Mike and his dad sat on the bed .


“Did you like the tale of ‘The Jumping
Frog _’_ ?” Mike’s dad asked .


“Yes,” said Mike . “I liked how Pete tricked
Jim by feeding his frog the limes!”


“Then I think you will like this next tale as
well . It involves a trick, too . The name of this
one is ‘The Hare and the Hedgehog’ .”


“What’s a hare?”


“It’s like a rabbit .”


“OK . Tell it!”



34


35


Once there was a hare who was proud of his
speed . He liked to brag . “I’m so fast!” he said . “I
am the fastest! No one is as fast as me!”


Well, the hedgehog got sick of all this
bragging . He set himself to thinking how he
could trick the hare and get him to stop bragging
all the time .


The hedgehog made a plan . He went to the
hare and said, “Let’s race!”



36


37


The hare smiled . “You and I?” he said . “Is
this a joke? What would be the point? Those legs
of yours are like stumps . It must take you from
sunrise until sundown to hike a mile!”


“Will you join me in a race?” said the
hedgehog .


“I will join you!” said the hare .


“Good,” said the hedgehog . “We will race
south from this fence up to the house on the hill .
But I can’t race till I have my lunch . I’ll be back
at one .”



38


39


Then the hedgehog went home and spoke to
his wife .


“Wife,” he said, “at one I will run a race with
the hare .”


“What?” said his wife . She frowned and asked,
“Are you out of your wits? He’s so fast! You can’t
hope to win a race with him .”


“Trust me,” said the hedgehog . “I have a
plan .”



40


41


“What’s his plan?” asked Mike .


“I will tell you next time,” said his dad .


“Well, rats!” said Mike . “It was just getting
good! I wish you could just tell me now .”


“Next time,” said his dad .



42


43


#### **How the Hedgehog** **Tricked the Hare**

“Where was it I left off?” asked Mike’s dad .


“The hedgehog was telling his wife the
plan to trick the hare,” said Mike .


“Got it!” said his dad .



44


45


The hedgehog made a map of his plan . He
pointed to the map and outlined his plan to trick
the hare .


“The hare and I will race from down by the
fence up to the house on the hill,” the hedgehog
said to his wife . “I need you to stand next to the
house . Stand in a spot where the hare can’t see
you . And be on the lookout, my dear!”


The hedgehog’s wife nodded and said, “Your
map is clear . I will be there .”


The hedgehog went on, “When the hare gets
close, you must pop out and shout, ‘There you
are! What took you so long?’ But when you do
this, make your voice deep and stern like my
voice . The hare can’t tell one hedgehog from the
next . If you sound like me, he will think you are
me . And he will think that he has lost the race!”


“What a clever plan!” said his wife . “It’s
perfect!”



46


47


She puckered up and kissed him on one of his
cheeks, where he had no spikes . The hedgehog
handed his wife the map .


After his meal, the hedgehog went to the
fence . His wife went up to the house on the hill .


The hedgehog and the hare lined up .


“All set?” said the hare .


“All set,” said the hedgehog .


“Run!” said the hare .


The hare bounded off . He was a fast and
powerful runner . In a flash he ran down the hill,
past the well, and up to the house .


When he got to the top of the hill, there was a
hedgehog standing next to the house .



48


49


It was the hedgehog’s wife, but she spoke in
a deep, stern voice like a male hedgehog . “There
you are!” she said . “What took you so long?”


The hare was stunned . “It can’t be!” he said .
“How did you get here so fast? I will race you
back to the fence!”


And so the hare ran back past the well and up
the hill until he got back to the fence .


And what did he see when he got there?


A hedgehog! This time it was the male
hedgehog . The hedgehog said, “There you are!
What took you so long?”


“No, no, no!” screamed the hare . The hare lost
his temper . “It can’t be . It can’t be . I am faster . I will
race you back to the house! You can’t beat me!”



50


51


So the hare ran back up the hill, past the well,
and up to the house .


And what did he see when he got there?


A hedgehog! This time it was the hedgehog’s
wife . In a deep, stern voice, she said, “There you
are! What took you so long?”


The hare ran to the fence and back ten times .
But it was the same all ten times . At last he was
so tired out that he fell on the ground next to the
male hedgehog . He could not stop huffing and
puffing . He frowned and said, with a gasp, “I feel
weak . You are faster and better than me!”


The hedgehog just smiled .



52


53


#### **The Pancake, Part I**

“Did you enjoy the tale of the hedgehog
and the hare?” asked Mike’s dad .

“Yes, I liked it,” said Mike . “The hedgehog
came up with a good trick .”

“The tale I’d like to tell you next has a trick
in it, too .”

“Cool!” said Mike . “Is there a hedgehog in it?”

“Nope,” said his dad . “But there is a
pancake in it!”

“A pancake?”

“Yep .”

“Neat! Tell it!”

“But the sun has not set yet! The street
lamp is not on yet!”

“Please! I would like to hear it! Will you
tell the pancake tale?”



54


55


Once upon a time there was a mom who had
six kids . One morning the mom was grilling
a pancake for the kids . The kids looked at the
pancake . They got out their forks and started
licking their lips .


The pancake looked back at the kids . He was
scared . He feared the kids would eat him . When
the mom was not looking, the pancake jumped
out of the pan and ran off .



56


57


The pancake ran out of the house .


“Stop, pancake!” shouted the mom from
the porch .


“Stop, pancake!” shouted the six kids .


All seven of them chased the pancake as he ran
out of the yard .


But the pancake was too fast . He outran
them all .



58


59


The pancake ran north on a foot path . He
zoomed past a barn and two farmers who were
plowing the ground .


“Why are you running, pancake?” the
farmers asked .


The pancake shouted, “I’ve outrun a mom and
six kids, and I can outrun you too! I’m too fast
and too smart for you .”


“You think so?” said the farmers . They started
running . But the pancake was too fast . He outran
the farmers .



60


61


Just then Mike’s sister Ann came in . She was
just three . She had on her gown for bed .


“Dad,” she said, “will you tell it to me, too?”


“Yes, I will,” said her dad . “You can sit up
here with Mike and hear the rest of the tale .”



62


63


#### **The Pancake, Part II**

“Let’s see,” said Mike’s dad . “Where did
I stop?”


“The pancake was running,” said Mike .
“He had just outrun the two farmers .”


“OK,” said Mike’s dad . “Let’s start there .”



64


65


The pancake ran on until, by and by, he ran
past a pig .


“Why are you running, pancake?” the
pig asked .


The pancake shouted, “I’ve outrun a mom, six
kids, and two farmers, and I can outrun you too!
I am too fast and too smart for you .”


“You think so?” said the pig . Then it snorted
and started running . The pig chased the pancake .
But the pancake was too fast .



66


67


The pancake ran on until, by and by, he ran
past a hen .


“Why are you running, pancake?” the
hen asked .


The pancake shouted, “I’ve outrun a mom,
six kids, two farmers, and a pig, and I can outrun
you too! I am too fast and too smart for you .”


“You think so?” said the hen . Then she set off,
clucking as she ran . The hen chased the pancake .
But the pancake was too fast .


The pancake went on until, by and by, he ran
past a fox .



68


69


“Why are you running, pancake?” the
fox asked .


The pancake said, “I’ve outrun a mom, six




The pancake stopped running and yelled,
**“I’ve outrun a mom, six kids, two farmers, a**
**pig, and a hen, and I can outrun you too! I am**
**too fast and too smart for you!”**


The fox squinted and said, “What was that
you said? I still could not quite hear you . Why
do you stand so far off? Stand nearer to me so I
can hear you .”


The pancake ran up near to the fox . Then he
shouted at the top of his lungs: **“I’VE OUTRUN**
**A MOM, SIX KIDS, TWO FARMERS, A PIG,**
**AND A HEN, AND I CAN OUTRUN YOU**
**TOO! I AM TOO FAST AND TOO SMART**
**FOR YOU!”**



72


73


“You think so?” said the fox . “I think you
made a mistake and got a bit too close .” Then he
scooped the pancake into his mouth and ate it for
dinner .


And that was the end of the pancake . And that
is the end of the tale .



74


75


#### **The Panther**

Mike and Ann ran in .


“Dad,” said Mike, “Please tell us a
bedtime tale!”


“Yes,” said Ann, clapping her hands . “Tell
us a pancake tale .”



76


“I would if I could,” said their dad . “But
I can’t .”


“Why not?” asked Mike .


“As far as I can tell, there is just one
pancake tale .”


“Oh no!” said Mike . “Now I’m in a
sad mood .”


“Let’s sit down on Mike’s bed,” said their
dad . “I’ll see if I can think of a good bedtime
tale that you will enjoy . Would you kids like a
tale that has a panther in it?”



77


“What’s a panfer?” Ann asked . Since she
was just three, sometimes when she said /th/ it
came out sounding like /f/ .


“It’s panther,” said Mike with a smile .


“Panfer!” said Ann .


“Ug!” said Mike .


“Mike,” said their dad . “That can be a hard
sound for many kids . Please say sorry .”


“I’m sorry, Ann .”


Their dad nodded . Then he spoke to Ann .
“A panther is a huge black cat that has sharp
teeth .”


“Tell it!” said Ann . “Tell the panfer tale!”



78


“OK,” said their dad . “The name of this
tale is ‘The Panther _’._ ”



79


Once there was a panther who could no
longer hunt . His legs were just too tired . His
joints were just too stiff . So he went in his cave
and sat down near the mouth of the cave .


The panther still had to get food to eat . But
how could he get food without hunting? At last
he came up with a plan .


Soon, an owl came up to the mouth of
the cave .


“How are you feeling, Panther?” the
owl asked .


“Not so well,” said the panther . “I am sick and
can’t leave my cave . Will you visit me in my cave?
When someone is sick, it is so nice to have a pal
visit .” The owl went in for a visit . He stepped
inside . But he did not step out .



80


81


Next a hare came hopping by .


“How are you feeling, Panther?” the
hare asked .


“Not so well,” said the panther . “I am sick .
Will you visit me in my cave? When someone
is sick, it is so nice to have a pal visit .” The hare
went inside the cave for a visit . He hopped
inside . But he did not hop out .



82


83


Next a fox ran up .


“How are you feeling, Panther?” the fox asked .


“Not so well,” said the panther . “I am sick .
Will you visit me in my cave? When someone is
sick, it is so nice to have a pal visit .”


“Thanks,” said the fox, “but no thanks!”


“Why not?” asked the panther .


“You can’t fool me,” said the fox . “I see lots of
footprints going into your cave, but there are no
footprints going out of it .”


**Moral: Be careful who you trust.**



84


85


“What a clever fox,” said Mike .


“I don’t understand,” shouted Ann . “What
happened?”


“It seems that Mike is as smart as the
fox,” said the dad . “Perhaps he can tell you
the reason the fox said ‘No thanks!’ to the
panther .”



86


“The fox is smart,” Mike said . “He tricked
the pancake and could tell that the panther
was tricking him . You can’t trick a trickster
like the fox!”



87


88


#### **Cat and Mouse Keep House**

“Dad,” said Mike, “can you tell us a
bedtime tale that has a trick in it?”


“A trickster tale?” asked the dad .


“Yes!” shouted the kids with one voice .


“OK,” said the dad . “The name of this tale
is ‘Cat and Mouse Keep House’ _._ ”



89


Once, a cat and a mouse set up house .


“We must get some food for the winter,” said
the mouse .


“Yes,” said the cat . “We must indeed .”


So the two of them went out and got a jar
of jam .


“Where can we hide this jar of jam to keep it
safe?” asked the cat .


“Let’s hide it in the house next door,” said the
cat . “No one is in that house .”


“Yes,” said the mouse . “The old house next
door is just the place!”



90


91


So the cat and the mouse hid the jar of jam in
a dark corner of the house next door . They said
that they would let it sit there until winter came .


A week passed . The cat felt a pang of hunger .
He started thinking of the jar of jam . What if he
went and had just a bit of jam for a snack? There
would still be a lot left .



92


93


The cat made a plan to trick the mouse .


“Mouse,” said the cat, “I must run off for a
bit . Will you keep the house while I am out?”


The cat ran to the house next door and got
out the jar . He started licking the jam . He licked
and licked . When he stopped there was just a bit
of jam left . Then he ran back home .



94


95


A week passed . This time it was the mouse
who felt a pang of hunger .


“The cat is napping,” he said to himself .
“I think I will visit the house and get myself a
snack . I will just have a bit of the jam . What’s the
harm in that? There will still be a lot left .”


The mouse ran to the house next door . When
he got there, what did he see? A jar with no jam!
The cat had tricked him . The mouse was mad .
He ran back and woke up the cat .



96


97


“You tricked me!” said the mouse .


“Did I?” said the cat .


“You ate the jam we said we would save for
winter! You had it for a snack!” the mouse yelled .


“Yes!” said the cat . “I could have you for
a snack!”


But the mouse was too mad to stop .



98


99


“You tricked me!” he shouted . “Now we have
no jam! Now we . . .”


But he did not have time to finish his
sentence . The cat pounced on the mouse and
made an end of him .


**Moral: Be careful who you trust.**



100


101


“What do you think is the point of the
tale?” asked the dad . “Is there a point?”


Mike said, “I think that the point is that
mice should not keep house with cats .”


“I like that!” said the dad . “My dad used to
tell me that tale when I was a kid . He said the
point of it was: Be careful who you trust .”


Then the dad got up and tugged on the
drapes .


“Look there!” he said . “It’s dark outside .
The street lamp is on . The tale is finished .
It’s time for bed .”

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully leveled
in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.

The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many spellings
can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to make early
reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of the available
spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out as part of their
phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been deliberately
introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if they are
assigned at the proper time.

As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.
