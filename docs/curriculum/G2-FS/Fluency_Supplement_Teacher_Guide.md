# **Fluency Supplement**

Research demonstrates that fluency practice produces gains in reading
comprehension. The program’s fluency instruction includes modeled reading,
assisted reading (such as choral or paired reading), independent reading, along
with breadth of text encounters and extended deep reading of selected texts.
This multi-faceted approach ensures that students receive low-stakes practice
along with engaging, authentic fluency tasks, such as performances.

This fluency supplement was created to accompany the program’s Grade 2
materials. It consists of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, as well as Reader’s
Theater selections. These additional text selections provide opportunities
for students to practice reading with fluency and prosody (expression). The
selections are grouped by unit to relate to the topics of each Grade 2 Skills
unit reader. The selections within a given unit can be used in any order, though
they are arranged in this supplement according to word count, starting with the
shortest selections.

The fluency routine outlined below provides a structured approach that
equips students to read passages accurately and with expression, including
phrasing and intonation. As they gain accuracy and confidence, they will
naturally begin to read more quickly. However, it’s important not to pressure
students to race through the text or read with undue speed. In addition, it is
not a memorization drill—students should read the text as they perform, even
if they have memorized the words. The goal is to read smoothly, accurately,
and with prosody.

At the beginning of the week, you should make sufficient copies of the week’s
selection for each student. You should model reading the selection aloud to all
students. When time allows, have students spend time practicing reading the
passages aloud each day and encourage additional practice at home. During
classroom practice, you should circulate around the room and provide students
with corrective feedback. The expectation for all students should be that they
are prepared to read the selection fluently and with prosody by Friday.

The five-day fluency performance routine below includes the following
components:

**Day 1:** Introduce the text and read it aloud several times, modeling different
tones or inflections, phrasing, and expression, and encouraging students to
reflect on each one. For example, if you read in a monotone, students should
realize that this is not a stellar reading; they may suggest better approaches,
such as reading in a happy tone, an excited tone, a nervous tone, or other tone


_Grade 2_ | Fluency Supplement **1**


appropriate to the selected text. Discuss with students that text features, such
as punctuation, and sentence structure can help them know when to read
text with phrasing, intonation, and expression (prosody). After modeling, invite
students to read aloud sample sentences from the text.

Students are encouraged to start reading the target text aloud at home. They
may use reading logs to record each session, if desired.

**Day 2:** Students practice reading the text chorally, with varying inflection or
tone, phrasing, intonation, expression (prosody), or other elements.

**Day 3:** Students practice both choral and paired readings, continuing to
develop tone, inflection, phrasing, intonation, and expression (prosody). Listen
to students practice reading and provide corrective feedback where necessary.

**Day 4:** Students continue practicing paired readings in preparation for the
following day’s performance. Circulate around the room and provide paired
students with corrective feedback where necessary.

**Day 5:** Student pairs perform their reading.

**Differentiation Options:** Students who are ready for a challenge may be
prepared to perform the text independently, while students who require
additional support may read the text chorally in groups rather than pairs.

If you choose to evaluate students’ performances, you may use the Fluency
Passage Performance Rubric to evaluate each performance.












|Fluency Passage Performance Rubric|Col2|Col3|Col4|
|---|---|---|---|
||**Advanced**|**Proficient**|**Basic**|
|Accuracy|Reading contains<br>no errors in<br>pronunciation.|Reading contains<br>minimal errors in<br>pronunciation.|Reading contains<br>numerous errors in<br>pronunciation.|
|Rate|Reading is<br>conversationally<br>paced or paced to<br>show appropriate<br>emphasis and<br>inflection.|Reading is uneven,<br>with interspersed<br>periods of speed and<br>sluggishness.|Reading is labored<br>and slow.|
|Expression<br>(Prosody)|Expression is strong<br>throughout the<br>reading. While the<br>tone and volume<br>may vary, they<br>do so in keeping<br>with the student’s<br>understanding of the<br>piece.|Reading generally<br>sounds like everyday<br>speech, with<br>possible lapses<br>into expressionless<br>speech.|Words are<br>pronounced,<br>but they are not<br>spoken in a manner<br>that indicates an<br>understanding of<br>their meaning.|



_Grade 2_ | Fluency Supplement **2**


These selections may also be used to assess students’ performance in
fluency and expression (prosody). We recommend asking a student to read
a passage aloud for a set amount of time, such as one minute. During that
time, the student will read from their copy, while you use an additional copy
of the text to mark any words the student misses during the allotted time
and to record student’s use of expression (prosody), including phrasing and
intonation. At the conclusion of the allotted time, calculate the words read
correctly to get an estimate of the student’s fluency rate. Provide the student
with feedback and work together to set achievable goals to support each
student in reading smoothly, accurately, and with prosody. This activity may be
repeated throughout the year with different texts in order to measure student
progress in fluency.


_Grade 2_ | Fluency Supplement **3**


**Dear Family Member,**


Throughout Grade 2, your student will be bringing home short text selections
on a weekly basis to practice reading. Your student should read the selection aloud
each night to help them become increasingly fluent and able to read without
hesitation. We encourage you or another family member to read the selection
aloud first to model reading with fluency and expression (prosody).


At the end of each week, your student may be called upon to practice reading
the selection aloud in class.


Repeated readings of text help build reading fluency, which includes automatic
word recognition, expression (prosody), accuracy, and speed. The goal of using
these short text selections is to help your student continue to strengthen their
reading skills.

**1.** **“Did You Know?”**


Big cats, little cats, lions and kittens are a lot alike!
Cats are expert hunters! They are able to leap, run, crouch,
or stay perfectly still. Cats will stalk and then spring on their
prey. Sharp claws and sharp teeth help them, too. Cats also
see very well at night, and they have keen hearing, which helps
them when they hunt. Cats make wonderful pets, too. You will
see them use some of their hunting skills when they play with
you!

**2.** **“Your Sense of Smell”**


Sniff! Sniff! Your sense of smell tells your brain many
different things! When you smell something, your brain lets you
know if you smell something sweet, like candy, or stinky like a
skunk. Did you know that your sense of smell helps you taste
your food? It does! While your sense of taste tells you if your
food is sweet, sour, bitter or salty, your sense of smell is very
busy, too. It adds to the flavor in your mouth by helping you
smell food at the same time you taste it!

Whish! Whiz! A flash of fur just zipped by!

Was it a red fox, speedy and sly?

A rabbit hip-hopping to and fro?

A bobcat or lion? Friend or foe?


Click, zip, pop! Click, zip, thwack! Click, swish, smack!

Maybe a panther hunting a snack?

It made so much noise while on the chase,

And now it is gone, without a trace!


Whish! Whiz! A flash of fur just zipped past!

It was big and soft, and so, so fast…

Oh, that was easy! It was a snap!

Just my cat chasing a bottle cap!

**4.** **“Paw Prints”**


Jens asked for a pet for his birthday, but there was no pet
when his big day came. His sister gave him a box tied with a
ribbon. Jens opened the box and found a note. It said, “I will
take you to the animal shelter to select a pet. Happy Birthday!”


They drove to the shelter. Jens looked at all of the cats and
kittens and held two of them. As he put the tan and white cat
back in its bed, Jens saw paw prints on his shirt. “This is the
pet for me!” he said.

the bandit take? How do you know?


_(Clucking noises made by all readers)_


Let me take a close look. Bad news. Three chickens are gone,
and all of the eggs are gone! We’ve been robbed.


**Tim:** Could it be a fox bandit? Could it be an owl bandit?


**Granny:** What’s going on out here? You two are making more
noise than the chickens.


**Tim:** Oh, Granny! Three chickens are gone, and all of the eggs
are gone!


**Granny:** Well, well, well. I think I got up before you did! So, I
know the answer!


**Tim:** Please tell us. We are very curious!


**Granny:** I gathered all of the eggs and gave three chickens to
my brother this morning.


_(Everyone laughs)_


**Granny:** Just call me The Granny Bandit!

**6.** **“What Are Fables?”**


The fables lots of people know were said to be told by a
man named Aesop (“ee-sop”). He lived in Greece long, long
ago. Aesop wanted people to treat each other nicely. He knew
that people do not like to be told when they are not nice.
So, he wrote many of his stories about animals. His animal
characters did all of the things people do that can make
trouble! At the end of each story, Aesop gave a moral, or
lesson, for the story so people might think of ways to be nicer.

by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow


Mr. Finney had a turnip, 5

And it grew, and it grew, 11

And it grew behind the barn, 17

And the turnip did no harm. 23


And it grew, and it grew, 29

Till it could grow no taller; 35

Then Mr. Finney took it up 41

And put it in the cellar. 47


There it lay, there it lay, 53

Till it began to rot; 58

When his daughter Susie washed it 64

And put it in the pot. 70


Then she boiled it and boiled it, 77

As long as she was able; 83

Then his daughter Susie took it 89

And put it on the table. 95


Mr. Finney and his wife 100

Both sat down to sup; 105

And they ate, and they ate, 111

Until they ate the turnip up. 117

**8.** **“Rabbits and Hares”**


You may have heard the story about the tortoise and the
hare. Your first question may have been, “What is a hare?”
Well, a hare is like a rabbit, and it is not like a rabbit!


Let’s compare.


Hares are bigger, faster, and stronger than rabbits. They
have longer ears, feet, and legs. When a hare feels that danger
is near, it will run a long, long way to escape. Hares like to live
alone in an underground burrow.


Rabbits are a bit smaller, from head to toe, than hares.
When a rabbit feels that danger is near, it will quickly hop to
a hiding place. Rabbits like to live together in nests above
ground.


Rabbits and hares do look very much alike. But, they are
different, too!

_Eight year old Kate and her grandmother Nan are leaving a_
_book store, after just having met an author. They are walking to_
_the car._


**Kate:** Nan, I’d like to write a book!


**Nan:** That is a fantastic idea! I will help you, if you need help.
May I do the art for your book?


**Kate:** Oh, yes! Thank you.


_Kate and Nan arrive at home. Kate gets her writing supplies_
_and sits down at the table. She has been working for 20_
_minutes._


**Nan:** How is your book coming along?


**Kate:** I wrote down all of the cool things I did at your house
this summer. Once I got started, it went fast!


**Nan:** Sometimes when you write, you have to write things two
or three times to get the best words and the best word order.


**Kate:** Yes, at school it is called Plan-Draft-Edit-Write. It is a big
help!


**Nan:** What sort of book are you writing?


**Kate:** This is a book about my adventures out west while I was
visiting you!


**Nan:** I am very happy that you want to tell other children about
your summer with me here in the West.

**10.** **“The Blind Men and the Elephant”**


Once there were six blind men who wanted to know what 11
an elephant was. 14


The first blind man stretched his hands and felt the 24
elephant’s side. “I can feel it,” the man said. “The elephant is 36
like a big sturdy wall.” 41


The second man was standing near the elephant’s head. 50

He put his hand on the long, sharp tusk. “A wall?” he said. 63

“No, the elephant is not like a wall. It’s like a spear.” 75


The third man reached around the elephant’s leg with both 85

arms. He said, “I am sure both of you are wrong. The elephant 98

is more like a tree.” 103


The fourth man reached up and touched the elephant’s 112
ear. “All of you are wrong! An elephant is like a fan,” he said. 126


Now, the fifth man was standing by himself at the 136
elephant’s other end. He happened to grab the animal’s tail. 146
“Really, I don’t know where you people get these ideas,” he 157
said. “I can tell you an elephant is like a rope.” 168


The elephant tickled the sixth man with his trunk. Then he 179
said with a shudder, “All of you are wrong. It is clear to me that 194
the elephant is a very large snake.” 201


“Nonsense!” said the others as they quietly began to leave. 211

The men never bothered to put their heads together to 221
understand what the elephant was really like. 228

_(Dad and Fern go to the backyard, set up the chairs, and gaze_
_at the sky.)_


**Dad:** Do you see how round the moon looks tonight? 26


**Fern:** The stars are sparkling! 30


**Dad:** Stars are made of gas and fire. Our sun is a star made of 44

gas and fire, too. The stars are far, far away…past the houses, 57

trees, and clouds. 60


**Fern:** My teacher says groups of stars look like shapes of 70

things, and they have special names. 76


**Dad:** That’s right. This group looks like a dog. _(He points to a_ 84

_group of stars.)_ That set looks like a dipper or cup. ( _He points_ 92

_to another group of stars.)_ There is the North Star!! _(He points_ 97

Brittany and Brianna Winner are identical twins. Brittany 8

started selling her artwork to local stores when she was 18

six years old! At age seven, Brianna sang in front of many 30

audiences. One audience was over 30,000 people! Then, at 39

the end of fourth grade, they decided to write a book together. 51

It took nine months to finish the story. Can you guess what 63

happened? Their first book won many awards, it was a _best_ 74

_seller!_ The twins wrote more books, and today over 65,000 84

schools use Brittany’s and Brianna’s books. Their books are 93

sold at book stores all over America. The first book they wrote 105

will be made into a movie. 111


Brittany and Brianna are great examples of children 119

excelling! 120

**14.** **“Spelling Bees”**


Spelling Bees have been held for about 200 years. Some 10

experts believe spelling bees started in America! These 18

contests were started to give students a way to practice their 29

spelling words. People who write about history think that the 39

contests may have first been called a spelling match. The word 50

match is used here as you would use it to name a contest like 64

a tennis or golf match. Historians are not sure how use of the 77

word _bee_ came about. There are some good guesses, but 87

no one seems one hundred percent certain. Today, the most 97

famous spelling bee is the National Spelling Bee held every 107

May. This contest is so popular it can be seen on television. 119

made in printing places called United States Mints. Paper 32

money is not really made of paper! It is made of two kinds of 46

cloth combined: linen and cotton. Coins are made of different 56

metals. For example, the penny is made of copper and zinc. 67

The dime is made of copper and a metal called nickel. If you 80

have the chance, visit a United States Mint. You can visit in 92

person or online. 95


Working at a U.S. Mint would be fun! You might be an 107

artist, a counter, or maybe a member of the Mint Police Force! 119

There are many jobs to choose from at a mint. 129

**17.** **“Castles in the Middle Ages”**


Did you ever wonder where kings, queens, and knights of 10

long ago lived? Most of them lived in castles, which were forts! 22


A castle was made to protect people from enemies. The 32
walls were very high. Most castles also had watch towers. 42
These towers were taller than the walls, so knights could see 53
far across the land. 57


Many castles also had a moat. The moat was a very wide, 69
deep ditch filled with water. The entrance into the castle was 80
often a drawbridge over the moat. It could be moved up to 92
become a door that could seal off the entrance to the castle. 104


These three parts of the castle helped protect the knights, 114
the king and queen, and the people who lived near the castle. 126
If an enemy was near, people from the villages came inside to 138
be safe. This helped everyone inside stay safe and kept the 149
enemies outside! 151

**18.** **“Jousting”**


Long ago, when kings and queens lived in castles, they 10
were protected by knights. Knights would defend the land, the 20
castle, and the people from enemies. 26


In order to stay strong and keep their skills sharp, knights 37
would drill with spears, shields, and lances. The people of the 48
land liked to come and watch these drills. These practices 58
became big events in the same way people enjoy going to a 70
baseball game today. 73


Over time, practices became huge tournaments. Jousting 80
was the most popular event. Crowds of onlookers cheered 89
for their favorite knight as he charged toward another knight, 99
both riding fast horses. Each man held a lance tight in his hand 112
pointing it straight ahead. The knight who knocked the other 122
knight off of his horse was the winner! 130


These events were games and contests, but they were also 140
excellent practice in case the knights had to fight a war with 152
knights from another land. 156

**19.** **“An Outing”**


King William and his son, Edward, went out on a journey 11

one fine morning riding their favorite horses. They were 20

accompanied by Sir Arthur. The three made their way across 30

the castle drawbridge, through the meadow and up the hill to 41

the green forest. As they rode through the dense trees of the 53

forest, they talked about the happenings of the kingdom. All of 64

the men were looking forward to the upcoming jousting 73

tournament. Many knights from other kingdoms had begun to 82

arrive at King William’s castle. The knights spent their time 92

practicing their jousting in the courtyard of the castle. When 102

they weren’t practicing, the knights repaired their armor or 111

groomed their horses. Often the knights rode their horses out 121

into the countryside to give the animals a chance to exercise. 132


As King William’s group rounded a turn in the forest path, 142

they met just such a group of knights. Greeting each other 153

jovially, the knights joined the King’s group, and they made 163

their way back to the castle. 170

**20.** **“The Star-Spangled Banner”**


by Francis Scott Key


O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light, 10

What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming, 20

Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous 29

fight, 30

O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? 39
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air, 49

Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there, 60

O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave, 68

O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave? 80

**21.** **“Protecting the Star Spangled Banner”**


Air, light, and water are very good for plants. But when 11

those things are on or near a piece of cloth that is 200 years 25

old, it can be very bad! The flag that Francis Scott Key wrote 38

about at Fort McHenry is safe today. At the Smithsonian 48

Museum in Washington, D.C., that very flag is on display for all 60

to see. 62


Air, light, and water won’t damage it because the flag is 73
kept in a special chamber. The chamber is water proof, fire 84

proof, and the lights are kept very low in order to keep the flag 98

from rotting, burning, or fading. Only trained workers wearing 107
gloves are allowed to touch it. Many scientists worked 116

together to conserve, or protect, this very, very special flag. 126

**22.** **“The Flag at Fort McHenry”**


In 1813, a lady named Mary Pickersgill was hired to make 11

two flags for Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. One of 21

those flags became very famous! Mary made the flag that 31

inspired Francis Scott Key to write the Star-Spangled Banner. 40


The flag was stitched by hand using a needle and thread. 51
Mary was asked to make a huge flag 30 x 42 feet in size. (It 66
would be fun to measure the size of that flag!) The flag was 79

so big it did not fit in Mary’s house. She used a large building 93

across the street from her house to work on the flag. 104



114
Mary had some help with the sewing. Her daughter, two

124
nieces, and an indentured servant worked side by side with

136
Mary. It took the women about seven weeks to make the two

147
flags. Little did they know one of those flags would become

149
very famous!

**23.** **“Preserving the Star-Spangled Banner”**


**Two girls: Alyssa and Gretchen**


**Alyssa:** Hey Gretchen, take a look at this! 7

17
**Gretchen:** What is it now, Alyssa? I am trying to read.

**Alyssa:** Look at this program on TV. It’s all about how the folks 29

at the Smithsonian are trying to preserve the flag that flew over 41

Fort McHenry. 43


**Gretchen:** What’s so special about that flag? 49

60
**Alyssa:** It is the flag that was flying when Francis Scott Key

wrote our national anthem. 64


**Gretchen:** I still don’t get it; what’s so special about that flag 75

and Francis Scott Key? 79


**Alyssa:** In the War of 1812, there was a battle in the harbor at 92
Fort McHenry. 94

**Gretchen:** OK, so? 96


**Alyssa:** Francis Scott Key was a passenger on a boat and saw 107
the battle from the deck. 112

**Gretchen:** How come he didn’t get shot? 118

**Alyssa:** Well, I guess he was far enough away that he could 129

see but still be safe. 134


143
**Gretchen:** So why did he write a song about it?


**Alyssa:** It didn’t start out as a song. He wrote a poem about 155

trying to see if the Americans won the battle by watching 166

throughout the night to see if the flag was still on the flagpole. 179


**Gretchen:** Was it? 181


_Grade 2_ | Fluency Supplement **28**


**Alyssa:** Of course it was! 185


193
**Gretchen:** So that’s when he wrote our national anthem?


**Alyssa:** Yes, but it didn’t become our national anthem until 202

much later. 204


**Gretchen:** It’s pretty hard to sing. 209

**Alyssa:** Yes, it is but we should all try to learn the words and 222
sing it in a respectful way. 228

**Gretchen:** Will you teach me the words?
234
**Alyssa:** I thought you didn’t want me to bother you?
243
**Gretchen:** I changed my mind!
