# **Welcome!**
## **Grade 2, Unit 5** **Foundational Skills**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will learn spelling alternatives for vowel sounds.


**What** **will** **my** **student** **learn?**


Students will learn to segment words into single phonemes and spell each word one phoneme at a time. When reading,

students will learn to identify spellings that stand for single phonemes and then blend them to make words. Students

will learn the following vowel sounds and spellings in this unit: /u/ spelled ‘u’ ( _but_ ), ‘o’ ( _son_ ), ‘ou’ ( _touch_ ), and ‘o_e’ ( _come_ );

/ә/ (also called the schwa sound) spelled ‘a’ ( _about_ ) and ‘e’ ( _debate_ ); /ә/ + /l/ spelled ‘al’ _(animal)_, ‘il’ ( _pencil_ ), ‘el’ ( _travel_ ), and

‘le’ ( _apple_ ); and /sh/ + /ә/ + /n/ spelled ‘tion’ ( _action_ ). Students will work on each vowel sound for several days. The

Reader for this unit is _Sir_ _Gus_, which details the experiences of Sir Gus, one of King Alfred’s knights. Despite being

known as “Sir Gus the Fearless,” Sir Gus faces many different fears, such as a thief, a troll, pirates, an evil wizard, and an

enemy king. Students will continue to practice narrative writing by rewriting an ending to the story “Fire!” from _Sir_ _Gus_ .

that demonstrate the meaning of each word and explain its context.
