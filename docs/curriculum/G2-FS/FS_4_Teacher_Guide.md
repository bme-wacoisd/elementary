**Grade 2 | Foundational Skills 4**
Introduction


~~**UNIT 4 OVERVIEW**~~


Unit 4 is devoted to introducing more spelling alternatives for vowel sounds and three tricky spellings.
Remember vowel sounds and their spellings are the most challenging part of the English writing system.
Only two vowel sounds are almost always spelled just one way (/a/ and /ar/). The other seventeen vowel
sounds have at least one significant spelling alternative. Several of them have many spelling alternatives.


Many opportunities are provided in this unit for review of the spelling alternatives. The specific
sounds and spellings introduced for the first time in this unit are:


  - /er/ spelled ‘er’ ( _her_ ), ‘ur’ ( _hurt_ ), ‘ir’ ( _bird_ )


  - /i/ spelled ‘y’ ( _myth_ )


  - /ie/ spelled ‘y’ ( _try_ ), ‘igh’ ( _night_ )


  - /oe/ spelled ‘ow’ ( _snow_ )


  - /ee/ spelled ‘e’ ( _me_ ), ‘y’ ( _funny_ ), ‘ey’ ( _key_ )


  - /aw/ spelled ‘al’ ( _wall_ )


**Tricky Spellings**


Some of the spellings introduced in this unit represent multiple sounds. For example, the spelling
‘y’ is introduced as a spelling alternative for the /i/ sound. Also, ‘y’ is a spelling alternative for the
/ ie/ sound, and a spelling alternative for the /ee/ sound. In addition, students already know ‘y’ is
the basic code spelling for the /y/ sound. One could say this spelling is shared between /i/, /ie/,
/ee/, and /y/. Or one could say it is ambiguous because it can stand for either /i/, /ie/, /ee/, or
/y/. Because this spelling can stand for more than one sound, it is called a tricky spelling. Tricky
spellings often pose a problem for the reader. When a reader comes across an unfamiliar word
containing the ‘y’ spelling, he or she may need to try pronouncing the tricky spelling different ways
to determine the actual pronunciation of the word.


The following tricky spellings are taught in this unit:


  - ‘e’ can be pronounced /e/ ( _pet_ ) or /ee/ ( _me_ )


  - ‘i’ can be pronounced /i/ ( _it_ ) or /ie/ ( _biting_ )


  - ‘y’ can be pronounced /ee/ ( _funny_ ), /i/ ( _myth_ ), /ie/ ( _try_ ), or /y/ ( _yes_ )


Introduction
**1**


**2**



**Tricky Words**


Tricky Words are introduced in this unit on an as-needed basis.


The following Tricky Words are introduced in stories in the Reader. They should be pretaught during
the lessons before the stories are read.


 - Lesson 3: _people, walk, grownup_


 - Lesson 16: _building_


 - Pausing Point: _statue_


**Note:** In the Reader, the story “Battery Park” is designated as a supplemental story for use during
the Pausing Point. If you use this story, you should preteach the word _statue_ as a Tricky Word.


When introducing these words, be sure to draw attention to the parts read (and spelled) just as students
would expect based on what they have learned so far and also to the tricky parts of each word.


As you introduce new spelling patterns, you will notice some words previously introduced as Tricky
Words can be seen as part of spelling patterns. For example, once you have taught ‘e’ as a spelling
alternative for /ee/, the words _he, she, we, be_, and _me_ no longer need to be treated as Tricky Words.
They can be described as members of a larger spelling pattern that includes words like _prefix_ and
_repeat_ . At this point, these words should be removed from the Tricky Word Wall, if you have one. You
may wish to place a green border around the yellow word cards and move the card to the Decodable
Word Wall. Alternatively, you may wish to rewrite the word onto a green card and place it on the
Decodable Word Wall. This is an excellent opportunity to demonstrate to students, visually, their
growing knowledge of sound/spellings.


**Decodable Reader: The Job Hunt**


_The Job Hunt_ is a fictional Reader that describes a nineteen-year-old girl’s search for a job in New
York City with the help of her younger brother. The Introduction contains information about New
York City, including a map.


**Reading**


At the Grade 2 reading level, the focus on reading through text-dependent questions is continued from
previous grades. Once again in this unit, directions are included for teachers to utilize a careful reading
approach with several stories from the Reader. These lessons are crafted to focus the student on the
text itself and precisely what meanings can be derived from the careful examination of said text.


Additionally, you will note that wherever these lessons occur (Lessons 4, 8, 15, and 17 of this unit), the
commitment to placement of decodable text in the Reader and Activity Book does not waiver. Reading
lessons will intensify as the units progress. You will find in this unit, the rigor has increased. The careful
reading lessons occur about once a week. Please note, for some weeks where writing or assessment are
the focus, there may not be sufficient time available to complete all of the careful reading activities.


Foundational Skills 4


**Spelling**


Weekly spelling lists and assessments continue in this unit. The spelling lists continue to be made up of
words with letter-sound correspondences that students have already been introduced to in reading.


At this point, students have learned one way to write every sound in English except for the very rare /zh/
as in _treasure_ . They also know a number of spelling alternatives for both vowel and consonant sounds.
They should be able to write a plausible, if not dictionary correct, spelling for any word in their oral
vocabulary. As the year goes on they will learn more and more of the spelling alternatives they will need
to achieve dictionary-correct spelling. However, it will take some time for most students to begin to spell
with a high level of accuracy, particularly when it comes to spelling vowel sounds.


Spelling achievement will generally trail reading achievement. First, students need to be introduced
to the spelling alternatives and learn to decode them while reading. Then, after many exposures to
the spellings in written words, students will begin to write the correct spelling independently. Some
students move fairly rapidly from seeing spelling alternatives in print and completing word sorts
to using the correct spellings in their writing. Others take longer to master conventional spelling.
It is not unusual for this to take several years and it is not surprising given the complicated nature
of the sound/spelling correspondence system of the English language. Nevertheless, the orderly,
systematic way in which the spelling code is taught in this program should lead to noticeable
improvements in spelling ability.


While spelling mastery is developing, you should continue to accept plausible spelling in drafts,
though you can also encourage correct spelling in revisions, particularly when the word is made up
of previously taught spellings.


During writing activities, students will have an opportunity to practice correctly spelling highfrequency words and words with sound-spellings they have learned. Refer to the scope and
sequence as needed to determine if the sound-spelling has been previously taught, and focus on
those words when reviewing their writing. Many writing assignments also use an editing checklist,
so students should be checking their spelling before submitting their assignment.


Students will also create a Dictation Journal that focuses on spelling words in isolation as well as in
sentences. Spelling assessments will also incorporate a phrase or sentence that students must spell
correctly.


  - For the dictation journal, you can either have students use a journal they use for other writing
activities or you may wish to create a small dictation journal for each student. Stapling five pieces of
paper together is all you will need for each journal. (1) ~~**TEKS 2.2.C.i; TEKS 2.2.C.iv**~~


**TEKS 2.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling one-syllable words with closed syllables; open syllables: VCe syllables: vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables, and final stable syllables; (iv) spelling multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns.


Introduction
**3**


**4**



**Grammar**


The grammar lessons for Unit 4 review singular and regular plural nouns, as well as common and
proper nouns. In addition, the formation of irregular plurals, the use of apostrophe-‘s’ with nouns to
indicate possession, and the use of titles, such as _Mr., Mrs., Ms.,_ and _Miss_, as a part of proper nouns
are all introduced. Students will continue to work with verbs, reviewing action verbs, learning about
_to be_ verbs, and working with verb tenses. Synonyms, antonyms, contractions, and quotations are
also reviewed.


~~**WRITING**~~


The writing strand continues with students learning about persuasive communication, specifically
how to incorporate persuasive writing as part of a friendly letter. Students will edit their drafts for
capitalization, end punctuation, commas in a series and in dates, pronoun cases, and prepositions.


**Left-Handed Cursive Writing Guidance**


Have students tilt their paper slightly. This will allow the wrist to sit at a natural arc while writing.


Allow your left-handed students to hold their pen or pencil with a relaxed grip, as gripping too
tightly can cause hand fatigue and strain.


Encourage your left-handed students to slant their writing to the left rather than to the right. This
will help them write more smoothly and with less smudging.


Model cursive letter formation for your left-handed students, showing them how to form each letter
from the left to the right.


Provide your left-handed students with plenty of practice time as they develop their skills.


~~**UNIT 4 ASSESSMENTS**~~


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


Throughout this unit, formative assessments are clearly marked for monitoring individual student
performance and progress in key skills. Quick “Checks for Understanding” to evaluate classroom
performance as a whole are also designated in various lessons.


Weekly spelling assessments continue in Unit 4. Each assessment is accompanied by a spelling
analysis sheet. An analysis of students’ performance on weekly spelling assessments may also be a
valuable tool in gaining insight into specific gaps in code knowledge for individual students. You are
encouraged to use the spelling analysis tool provided for each assessment to summarize data about
the types of errors students make. Use of this assessment and careful thought about students’
errors will give you insight into planning remediation of both decoding and encoding skills.


Foundational Skills 4


In addition, it is recommended that you continue using the Anecdotal Reading Record and the
Discussion Questions Observation Record, found in the Teacher Resources section at the end of
this Teacher Guide. You should circulate and listen to students read, making notes as you listen. You
should strive to hear every student read aloud at least once or twice a week.


Careful attention to this information, collected on a daily basis, will enable you to quickly determine
which students may benefit from reteaching and/or more practice in particular skills, using the
Additional Support activities found at the end of each lesson.


**Student Performance Assessment**


A multipart Student Performance Assessment occurs in Lessons 23–25. The assessment components
are the Reading Comprehension Assessment, the Grammar Assessment, the Fluency Assessment,
Dictation Identification Assessment, and the Cursive Writing Assessment. The Fluency Assessment
is administered one-on-one with students while the other assessments are administered to the class
as a whole group. If students struggle on these assessments, you may need to spend a few days
reviewing before moving on and/or you may need to conduct remedial work with specific students.


~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice the Unit 4 skills can be found in
Pausing Point section included after the last lesson. It is strongly recommended that you pause for
3 days and provide targeted remediation for individual or groups of students in any areas in which
they performed poorly on the end-of-unit assessment.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the _Fluency Supplement_, is available in the program’s online materials. This
component has been designed to complement the unit. In it, you will find a poem, an informational
text, a Reader’s Theater, a realistic fiction selection, and a science or social studies selection. See
the directions in the _Fluency Supplement_ for further guidance.


~~**APPENDIX**~~


The appendix using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words is included at the end of this Teacher Guide,
and syllable division is included in this Teacher Guide when appropriate. Use this as a resource when
working with students who have not mastered the ability to chunk words into syllables for decoding.

~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


In the Teacher Resources section at the end of the Teacher Guide, you will find additional forms and
charts that may be useful, including the following:


 - Reader’s Log: Included for the first time in Unit 4 is a student reading log. At this point, it is
highly recommended that students read independently at home for 20 minutes each night. You
may choose to have students keep a log of what they read at home, and/or of what they read
independently in class. ~~**TEKS 2.5**~~

  - Today’s letter-sound correspondences can be found on the following page of
the Vowel Code Flip Book.


**Vowel Code Flip Book**


1. ‘ur’ > /er/ ( _hurt_ ) page 19


2. ‘ir’ > /er/ ( _bird_ ) page 19


  - Tell students that, as in Unit 3, Unit 4 focuses on vowel sounds. They will learn
many new vowel sounds and spellings.


  - Tell students they will begin by reviewing the spelling ‘er’ for /er/. Remind
students, the letter ‘r’ is a spelling for a consonant sound, but the sound /r/
can mingle with certain vowel sounds, to create unique vowel sounds
like /er/.


  - We know /er/ is a vowel sound because adding it to the end of a word adds a
syllable: _steep > steeper_ .


  - Write the following words on the board/chart paper and ask students to read
them: _fern, western, perfect, interrupt._

 - Explain that the /er/ sound can be spelled by any of these letter
combinations. Review and read the words in each column aloud. Ask
students to share additional words that contain the /er/ sound and add it to
the appropriate column.


 - To acknowledge students who correctly provide a word with the /er/ sound,
but with a spelling not being taught, create a column for odd ducks and list
words there. Do not create and list words in the odd ducks column unless
students happen to suggest these words, such as _dollar, sailor,_ etc.


**Note:** See the appendix, Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words,
if students experience difficulty in reading two-syllable words.

 - Turn to **Vowel Code Flip Book page 19** and put the Spelling Card(s) ‘ir’
and ‘ur’ on the appropriate space(s). Discuss the power bar for each of the
spellings for the /er/ sound.


 - Today’s letter-sound correspondences can be found on the following page of
the Individual Code Chart.


**Individual Code Chart**


1. ‘ur’ > /er/ ( _hurt_ ) page 10


2. ‘ir’ > /er/ ( _bird_ ) page 10



Support


Point out that ‘er’ is the
spelling most often used
for /er/, but that students
will need to practice when
to use ‘ir’ and ‘ur’. Explain
that words with r-controlled
vowels are easy to sound out
because when they see ‘ir’,
‘ur’, and ‘er’, they will always
make the same /er/ sound.
Show that the /er/ sound
is made by pulling back the
tongue and pressing the
sides of the tongue to the
bottom sides of the teeth.
Air comes down from the
back of the throat to then
make the /er/ sound.


Challenge


Encourage students to
come up with different
words than the examples
provided that have ‘er’, ‘ur’,
and ‘ir’ spellings. The
letters ‘ur’ often stand for
/er/; however, they can also
stand for other sounds and
combinations, including /y/
+ /er/ ( _curious_ ), /ue/ + /r/
( _uranium_ ), and /or/ ( _four_ ).
Students who can decode
‘ir’ and ‘ur’ will probably also
be able to decode the rare
spellings ‘irr’ ( _squirrel_ ) and
‘urr’ ( _hurry_ ); those spellings
are not explicitly taught in
this program.

- Use the cards and the baseball diamond you prepared in advance for
this activity.


- Divide the class into two teams. You may consider having one team at a time
come to the front of the room and line up in front of the board/chart paper.
Or you may choose to have students stay seated and divide the class into
teams by seating arrangement. Each team takes a “turn at bat” as follows:


  - Choose a card from the stack and ask the first person on a team to
read it aloud. If the word is read correctly, draw a line from home plate
to first base, signifying a “hit.” This player then goes to the back of his
team’s line, while the next player comes forward to read the next card.
If the word is read correctly, draw a line from first to second base. Play
continues this way. If the fourth player reads the word correctly, draw
a line from third base to home plate and mark “1 run” for the team. Play
continues for this team as long as no words are misread; when a word
is misread, the next team takes its turn at bat.


  - Set a timer for ten minutes and tell students that whichever team has
the most runs when the timer rings is the winning team. Point out that
accuracy is important, but so is speed. The more turns players have to
read words, the more likely their team is to score runs.

When one sound can be spelled more than one way, we say that sound has
spelling alternatives.


  - Say the sound /aw/ as in _paw_ . Ask students if they can think of two ways to
spell the sound /aw/. If students are unable to remember the spellings for
/aw/, have them use the Individual Code Chart to find the answer.


  - Write ‘aw’ and ‘au’ on the board/chart paper.


  - Underneath ‘aw’, write the spelling words with this spelling, one word at a
time, saying the word aloud. Do the same for the words with the ‘au’ spelling.


  - Say the sound /oi/ as in _oil_ . Ask students if they can think of two ways to
spell the sound /oi/. If students need help with the spellings for /oi/, remind
them to use the Individual Code Chart to find the answer.


  - Write ‘oi’ and ‘oy’ on the board/chart paper.


  - Underneath ‘oi’, write the spelling words with this spelling, one word at a time,
saying the word aloud. Do the same for the words with the ‘oy’ spelling.


  - Repeat this procedure for the last three words with the /oo/ sound as in _soon_ .

Explain that the spelling
patterns ‘aw’ and ‘au’
represent the sound people
often utter when they see
something adorable like a
kitten. To make this sound,
the jaw drops, but the
tongue goes up a bit.


Explain that ‘oy’ and ‘oi’
stand for the sound in the

To make this sound, the
tongue will come forward
and touch the back of
the two front teeth. As
this happens the lips will
form a circle then pull

 - Tell students they will add words to the Spelling Trees.


 - Shuffle the leaves you prepared in advance. Show one leaf at a time and
guide the class as a whole in decoding and reading each word, syllable by
syllable if it is a multisyllable word.


 - Make sure all Spelling Trees are visible. Distribute the leaves to individuals,
pairs, or trios, depending on the number of leaves there are per word. Tell
students that if a word has only one syllable, only one student will have a leaf
for the word. If a word has two syllables, a pair of students will have leaves
with the same word. If a word has three syllables, a trio of students will have
leaves with the same word.


 - For one-syllable words, ask individual students to circle the letters
representing the vowel spelling in their word, identify the correct
Spelling Tree, and then tape their leaf to the correct branch.


Foundational Skills 4


 - For two- and three-syllable words, ask students to work with others who
have the same word. Each student should circle the letters that spell a vowel
sound in a single syllable, working on a different syllable than others with
the same word. When they finish, they should each take their leaves to the
appropriate Spelling Trees and tape them to the correct branches.

As students read the leaves, note which students are able to identify the correct

branch of the tree and which students struggle to place words on the

appropriate branches.

Foundational Skills 4


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today you will quickly review the basic code spelling of ‘y’ as /y/ and will
then introduce the letter ‘y’ as an alternative spelling for /i/. The following
chart shows ‘i’ is the spelling used most of the time for the /i/ sound.
However, there are more than 200 words in which /i/ is spelled with ‘y’, so it
is important for students to learn this spelling alternative.


Spellings for the Sound /i/


  - Here are some patterns for your information:


  - The sound /i/ does not occur at the end of words. It is always followed by a
consonant sound.


  - The ‘i’ spelling is used at the beginning of a word ( _inch, interesting_ ) and in the
middle of a word ( _swim, dish_ ).


  - At the beginning of a word, /i/ is almost always spelled with an ‘i’ ( _if, ignore, in_ ).


  - The ‘y’ spelling is used in the middle of a word ( _gym, system_ ).


  - Many words with the ‘y’ spelling came into English from Greek ( _gym, myth,_
_physics, synonym,_ and _Olympics_ ).

Tree for this lesson: _myth, gym, lynx, Lynn, hymn, Syd, system, cylinder,_
and _symbol_ .

**Lesson 3: Singular and Plural Nouns**
10M
Language


**Primary Focus:** Students will read singular nouns and orally indicate whether
to add the inflectional ending — _s_ or — _es_ to form the plural version of the noun.


~~**T E KS 2.2.C.i ; T E KS 2.2.C.iv; TEKS 2.2.C.vi**~~


~~**REVIEW SINGULAR AND PLURAL NOUNS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that today you will review singular and plural nouns. Write the
following words on the board/chart paper, but do not write the words in
parentheses.










  - Point to the first word, hold up one finger, and say “One match, but two…” and
pause for students to say _matches_ . Ask students how to change the singular
form of the noun _match_ to its plural form, making the changes on the board
as directed by students. Continue with the remaining words in the list.


  - To provide students with more practice in correctly spelling words in dictated
sentences, tell them they will write an entire sentence that you dictate using
the singular and plural nouns above. Students may use their Dictation Journal.


  - Read the sentence: _The foxes ran to the woods_ .


**TEKS 2.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling one-syllable words with closed syllables; open syllables:
VCe syllables: vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables, and final stable syllables; (iv) spelling
multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns; (vi) spelling words with prefixes, including un-, re-, and dis-, and
inflectional endings, including -s, -es, -ed, -ing, -er, and -est.



**EMERGENT**
**BILINGUAL**
**STUDENTS**


Language


**Using Nouns and Noun**

**Phrases**


Review the rules for how to
pluralize nouns.


- The plural of most nouns
is created simply by
adding the letter ‘s’ (e.g.,
more than one robot =
robots, more than one
plant = plants).


- Words that end in /ch/,
/ sh/, /x/, or /s/ will
require ‘es’ to become
plural (e.g., more than one
dish = dishes; more than
one match = matches;
more than one kiss =
kisses; more than one fox
= foxes; more than one
race = races).


- Students learning
English as a second
language will benefit
from explicit instruction
explaining that there are
several nouns that have
irregular plural forms (e.g.,
more than one child =
children; more than one
man = men; more than
one mouse = mice).

Foundational Skills


**Primary Focus**
Students will learn the sound/spelling /i/ > ‘y’ and will read single and
multisyllable words with /i/ > ‘y’, and /i/ > ‘i’. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.i; TEKS 2.2.B.v**~~


Students will read word pairs featuring /y/ > ‘y’ and /i/ > ‘y’ and will determine
whether or not ‘y’, is making the same sound in both words. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.i**~~


~~**INTRODUCE /I/ › ‘Y’ (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Prior to the lesson, turn to the following page of the Vowel Code Flip Book:


**Vowel Code Flip Book**


1. /i/ > ‘y’ ( _myth_ ) page 2


  - Write the letter ‘y’ on the board/chart paper and ask students to produce
the sound they have learned for this letter. _(/y/)_ . Remind students that in
Kindergarten they learned the letter ‘y’ makes the consonant sound /y/.


  - Write the following words with the ‘y’ spelling on the board/chart paper and
ask students to read them with you:









**36**




  - Ask students if they notice any pattern as to the placement of the letter ‘y’ in
these words. _(It is the first letter.)_ Point out that when the letter ‘y’ occurs at
the beginning of a word or syllable, it represents the /y/ sound.


  - Tell students that they are going to learn a new sound associated with the
letter ‘y’. When the letter ‘y’ occurs in the middle of a word, it often represents
the vowel sound /i/, not the consonant sound /y/.


  - Have students say the sound /i/.


  - Remind students that they have already learned one spelling for /i/: ‘i’.


**TEKS 2.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (i) decoding words with short, long, or variant vowels, trigraphs
and blends; (v) decoding words using knowledge of syllable division patterns such as VCCV, VCV, and VCCCV.


Foundational Skills 4


- Ask students if they can think of any words containing the /i/ sound.


- As students offer words, write the words on the board/chart paper, sorting
the words into columns according to the spelling used for /i/ and circling the
letter for the /i/ sound in each word.


- For example, if a student says _trick_, list the word under the heading ‘i’ and
circle the ‘i’. If a student says _gym_, list the word under the heading ‘y’ and
circle the ‘y’.


- Students may come up with examples of both of the spelling patterns listed,
but if the spelling ‘y’ as /i/ does not end up on the chart spontaneously,
introduce it. You can do this by writing one of the sample words on the
board/chart paper, helping students to read the word, and then asking them,
“Which letter stands for the /i/ sound in this word?”


- Write the remaining ‘y’ > /i/ words from the following box on the board/chart
paper. Guide students in reading them one at a time. Be sure to point out
that when the ‘y’ represents the /i/ sound, the letter occurs in the middle
of a word or syllable.


- Use the syllable division routine from Lesson 2 to help students decode the
multisyllabic words below.






|i|y|
|---|---|
|fsh<br>children<br>with<br>thin<br>did|myth<br>gym<br>system<br>cymbal|




  - Show students the Spelling Card for /i/ > ‘y’ ( _myth_ ). Have students read the
sample word. Discuss the power bar.

- Write the following words on the board/chart paper one at a time, circling the
‘y’ as /i/ spellings. Read each word aloud as a class.







Activity Page 3.1




 - Show students the Individual Code Chart. Ask students which of the two
spellings they have learned for /i/ has the longest power bar. Explain that the
spelling ‘i’ is used for /i/ in more words than the spelling ‘y’.


 - Hold up the leaves you prepared and call on a student to read each word.
Then have that student tape the word to the appropriate branch of the /i/
Spelling Tree.


 - Students can look to the following word pairs to remind them that _gym_
sounds the same as _Jim_ because the ‘y’ is making the sound /i/.


1. Jim—gym


2. symbol—cymbal


Check for Understanding


As students read the leaves, note which students are able to identify the correct

branch of the tree and which students struggle to place words on the

appropriate branches.

Foundational Skills


**Primary Focus**

Students will review the sound/spellings /ie/ > ‘i’, ‘ie’, and ‘i’ and will break twosyllable words into individual syllables to determine whether ‘i’ makes the /i/
sound or the /ie/ sound. ~~**[TEKS 2.2.B.i; TEKS 2.2.B.v]**~~


Students will read words with ‘i’ spellings and will complete fill-in-the-blank
sentences using these words. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.i; TEKS 2.2.C.i; TEKS 2.2.C.iv**~~


~~**REVIEW TRICKY SPELLING ‘I’ (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students you will start today’s lesson by reviewing the spellings they have
already learned for the /ie/ sound. Direct students’ attention to the Spelling
Tree for /ie/.


  - Remind students of the three different ways to spell the /ie/ sound.


  - To review, point to the ‘i_e’ branch and ask students to read three words with
the ‘i_e’ spelling. Next, point to the ‘ie’ branch and ask students to read three
words with the ‘ie’ spelling. Finally, point to the ‘i’ branch and ask students to
read three words with the ‘i’ spelling.


**TEKS 2.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (i) decoding words with short, long, or variant vowels, trigraphs
and blends; (vi) decoding words with prefixes including un-, re-, and dis-, and inflectional endings, including -s, es, -ed, -ing,
-er, and -est; (v) decoding words using knowledge of syllable division patterns such as VCCV, VCV, and VCCCV; **TEKS 2.2.C**

syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllable;
(iv) spelling multisyllabic words with multiple sound spelling patterns.


Foundational Skills 4


- Be sure to remind students that in multisyllable words, the letter ‘i’ is
pronounced as /ie/ when it comes at the end of a syllable. Write the following
words on the board/chart paper, pointing to the ‘i’ at the end of the first
syllable and reading each word to reinforce this concept.






- Remind students that the multisyllable words in their books are not
divided into syllables, so when they are not sure where or how to divide a
multisyllable word with ‘i’ into syllables, they should try pronouncing the ‘i’
as either /ie/, as in the open-syllable words listed previously, or /i/, as in the
following words.


- Write the following words on the board/chart paper, pointing to each syllable
in which the ‘i’ is followed by a consonant, and reading each word to reinforce
this concept.



Support


Use syllable division
strategies to scaffold the
meaning of multisyllable
words if needed.






- Refer back to the ‘i’ branch of the /ie/ Spelling Tree and ask students
whether the leaves presently attached to the branch are one-syllable or
multisyllable words. Most of the time when ‘i’ is used as a spelling for /ie/, it
is used in multisyllable words. However, there are a few one-syllable words
with the /ie/ sound that are spelled with the letter ‘i’ _._


- Write the word _mild_ on the board/chart paper. Point out that the letter ‘i’
is followed by a consonant. Tell students they might reason that this word
should be sounded out as /m/ /i/ /l/ /d/ because the word _milk_ is sounded
as /m/ i/ /l/ k/ and the word _mill_ is sounded as /m/ /i/ /l/.


- Explain, that in several words ending with the spelling ‘ild’ the ‘i’ is read as
/ ie/. Point to the word _mild_ and guide students in sounding it out as /m/ /ie/
/l/ /d/. Write the following words under _mild_ and guide students in reading
each of these words.






  - Circle ‘ild’ as you read each word, pointing out the pattern.


  - Explain that there is another group of one-syllable words in which the letter
‘i’ represents the /ie/ sound. Write the following words on the board/chart
paper and guide students in sounding out each word with the /ie/ sound.


Lesson 4 Review: Tricky Spelling ‘i’
**49**


Support


Have students choose one
‘ild’ word and one ‘ind’ word.
Tell them to write each
word on an index card and
illustrate the word. On the
back, have them use the
word in a sentence and
write the sentence down.
These word cards can be
kept to remind them of how
to read the two spelling
patterns.


Challenge


Write three categories on
the board/chart paper: ‘i_e’,
‘ind’, and ‘ild’. Challenge
students to listen to the
following word list. Ask
students which category
to write the word in.
Remind them to listen very
carefully. Enunciate clearly.


Word List: _mind, wild, pile,_
_kind, fine, shine, child, bind_


Activity Page 4.1


**50**








 - Circle ‘ind’ as you read each word, pointing out the pattern.


**Note:** You may also want to point out that _wind_ can be sounded out as
/w/ /ie/ /n/ /d/, as in, “Please wind up the hose so we don’t trip over it,” or
as /w/ /i/ /n/ d/, as in, “The wind is really blowing hard today.” Tell students
that this is one of those words where you just have to try both sounds and
see which pronunciation makes sense for the way it is used.


 - Shuffle the leaves in which one-syllable words have an /ie/ sound spelled
with ‘i’. Have students read each word one at time. Ask a student to use the
word aloud in a sentence and then tape it on the correct branch of the /ie/
Spelling Tree.


Check for Understanding


As students read the leaves, note which students are able to identify the correct branch

of the tree and which students struggle to place words on the appropriate branches.

  - Point to the /ie/ Spelling Tree and ask students to say the sound for the
different spellings on the various branches of this tree that represent (/ie/).
Then point to each branch, noting the specific spelling and reading sample
words on each branch: ‘i_e’, ‘ie’, and ‘i’. Read two sample words for ‘i’: one that
is a multisyllable word in which the letter ‘i’ occurs at the end of a syllable and
one that is a one-syllable word ending in either ‘ild’ or ‘ind’.


  - Shuffle the leaves you removed prior to the lesson. Display one leaf at a time
and ask the class to read the word aloud. Call on a student to tell you where
the leaf should be placed and then ask that student to tape the leaf to the
correct branch.


  - Tell students that today they will learn a new spelling for the /ie/ sound.

 - Hold up one of the leaves and point out the ‘igh’ spelling for the /ie/ sound.
Call on a student to read the word. Then have the student tape the leaf to the
appropriate branch of the tree.


 - Continue until all the words have been read and the leaves have been placed
on the appropriate branch.


Check for Understanding


As students read the leaves, note which students are able to identify the correct branch

of the tree and which students struggle to place words on the appropriate branches.


 - Show students the Spelling Card for ‘igh’ > /ie/ _(night)_ . Have students read
the sample word. Discuss the power bar.


 - Turn to **Vowel Code Flip Book page 10** and put the Spelling Card on the
appropriate space.


 - Ask students which of the five spellings they have learned for /ie/ has the
longest power bar. Explain that ‘i’ is used as a spelling for /ie/ in more words
than ‘i_e’, which is used as a spelling for /ie/ in more words than ‘igh’, which is
used as a spelling for /ie/ in more words than ‘ie’.


**Note:** Students may notice and comment that there is still one additional
spelling for /ie/ on the Vowel Code Flip Book page that has not yet been
taught, /ie/ spelled as ‘y’; this spelling will be taught in the next lesson.

Exclamation Points


An exclamation point
usually shows strong
feeling, such as surprise,
anger, or joy. Using an
exclamation point when
writing is like raising your
voice when speaking.


If students are Spanish
speakers and are
accustomed to seeing
written Spanish, explain
that exclamation points are
used differently in English
than in Spanish. In Spanish,
two exclamation points
are used: an inverted one
at the beginning of an
emotional sentence and a
“right-side-up” exclamation
point at the end. Make the
distinction clear to avoid
confusion.

~~**INTRODUCE THE STORY (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that they have been reading stories about Kurt and Kim,
as Kim hunts for a job. So far, Kim has not really started her search for a job
because she and Kurt stopped to listen to the drummers in Drummer’s Grove, a
special place in Prospect Park, which is located in Brooklyn, New York.


  - Tell students that today they will read a story called “Dwight’s Lights” in which
Kim starts her job search in earnest. Ask students to find the story listed in the
table of contents and turn to the correct page in the Reader. Ask students if
they have any predictions about where Kim’s job hunt will lead them today.


  - Write an exclamation point on the board/chart paper and ask students what
this type of punctuation tells the reader to do. (Read with excitement.) Tell
students they will see exclamation points throughout “Dwight’s Lights.” Also,
let them know there is a paragraph written in bold. Like the exclamation
point, bold lettering tells the reader the words are to be emphasized.
Challenge students to read with expression, especially when they read
sentences with exclamation points and bold letters.


  - Tell students that they will see the word “Street” used in the story (Wall
Street). Explain that abbreviations are often used when writing addresses.
Write St. on the board. Explain that this is an abbreviation for the word
street. Repeat with Blvd./Boulevard, Ave./Avenue, and Pl./Place. Explain that
when we write an abbreviation, we place a period at the end. Point out that
abbreviations used in addresses are usually capitalized because they are part
of proper nouns (e.g. Park Ave.).


  - Have students use their own paper to write their addresses using correctly
formatted abbreviations. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iv; TEKS 2.2.C.iii**~~

Foundational Skills



**Primary Focus**
Students will read words with ‘y’ > /ie/, /i/, and /y/.



~~**TEKS 2.2.B.i; TEKS 2.2.B.iii**~~



Students will recognize that ‘y’ can also make the /ie/ sound and identify words
with ‘y’ as /ie/. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.i**~~


~~**INTRODUCE TRICKY SPELLING ‘Y’**~~ ~~>~~ ~~**/IE/ (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that the letter ‘y’ is really tricky. They have already learned two
sounds the letter ‘y’ can represent: the consonant sound /y/ and the vowel
sound /i/.


  - Today they will learn another new sound the letter ‘y’ can also represent.


  - Explain the new sound the spelling ‘y’ can represent is /ie/ as in _try_ .


  - The tug of war for ‘y’ as a tricky spelling is now a three-way tug of war.

- To begin the lesson, display the Consonant Code Flip Book and Vowel Code
Flip Book side by side, if possible, and open to the following pages:

|Consonant Code Flip Book|Vowel Code Flip Book|
|---|---|
|1.<br>‘y’ > /y/ (_yes_) **page 22**|1.<br>‘y’ > /i/ (_myth_) **page 2**|



- Point to the Consonant Code Flip Book and remind students they have
already learned that ‘y’ is a consonant sound. Ask students to read the word
on the Spelling Card. _(yes)_


- Then ask students to read the following words as you write them on the board/
chart paper:










- Then point to the Vowel Code Flip Book and remind students they have
learned that ‘y’ can make the /i/ sound. Ask students to read the word on the
Spelling Card. _(myth)_


- Have students read the following words as you write them on the
board/chart paper.






- Show students the Spelling Card for ‘y’ > /ie/ ( _try_ ). Have students read the
sample word. Discuss the power bar. Add the Spelling Card to **Vowel Code**
**Flip Book page 10.**








  - Distribute the green markers. Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart**
**page 8** . Guide students in outlining the appropriate card and spelling on
the chart.


Lesson 6 Tricky Spelling: Introduce ‘y’ › /y/, /i/, or /ie/
**81**


- Ask students to look at the Individual Code Chart as you quickly review
the other spellings for /ie/ on **Vowel Code Flip Book page 10** . Next, ask
students which of the four spellings for /ie/ has the longest power bar. Write
the various spellings of /ie/ on the board/chart paper in order of frequency
and tell students they have now learned all of the different ways in which / ie/
may be spelled. Note that ‘y’ is used to represent the /ie/ sound typically
when that sound occurs at the end of a word.









**82**



**/ie/ Spelling Tree**

 - Shuffle the spelling leaves you prepared.


 - Hold up one of the leaves and call on a student to read the word. Then have
the student tape the leaf to the appropriate branch.


 - Continue through the stack of leaves in this manner.


**Note:** The words _my, by,_ and _why_, previously taught as Tricky Words, can now
be seen as decodable words in which the /ie/ sound is spelled as ‘y’. These
words can be moved from the Tricky Word Wall to the Decodable Word Wall.
You may wish to draw a green border around the card before placing it on
the Decodable Word Wall. Alternately, you may wish to rewrite the word on
a green card as the class observes you.


 - Summarize and review the tricky spelling ‘y’ and the tug of war between the
different sounds it can represent.


 - Create the following chart on the board/chart paper, with a column for each
sound: /y/, /i/, and /ie/. Now write each word, one at a time, in the correct
column and circle the tricky spelling ‘y’ in each word. Read the word aloud as
a class.

**Lesson 6: Change ‘y’ to ‘i’ and add –es**
10M
Language


**Primary Focus:** Students will write the inflectional endings – _s_ and – _es_ to singular
nouns to form plural nouns and will change ‘y’ to ‘i’ when adding – _es_ to the ends of
nouns or verbs. ~~**TEKS 2.2.C.i; TEKS 2.2.C.iv; TEKS 2.2.C.vi**~~


~~**CHANGE ‘Y’ TO ‘I’ AND ADD –ES (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students you are still going to work with words ending in the letter ‘y’ and
representing the /ie/ sound, but are going to talk about some spelling changes
that may happen to words ending in the letter ‘y’. Explain that you will start first
by looking at what changes are necessary to change a singular noun to plural
noun, if the word ends in ‘y’.


  - Remind students that they have already learned two ways to change a
singular noun to a plural noun by adding either ‘s’ or ‘es’. Write the following
nouns on the board/chart paper and ask students to tell you how to make
them plural. Write the plural form next to the singular noun, making whatever
spelling changes students direct you to make.


  - Now write the singular nouns from the following box that end in the letter ‘y’ on
the board/chart paper and show students how to change these singular nouns
to plural nouns by changing the ‘y’ to ‘i’ and then adding – _es_ .


  - Think aloud through the process as you write the words. You may wish to say
something like:


    - “To make singular nouns ending in the letter ‘y’ plural, you have to follow
a special spelling rule. To change the singular noun, _one firefly_, to a plural


**TEKS 2.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling one-syllable words with closed syllables; open syllables:
VCe syllables: vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables, and final stable syllables; (iv) spelling
multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns; (vi) spelling words with prefixes, including un-, re-, and dis-, and
inflectional endings, including -s, -es, -ed, -ing, -er, and -est.


Foundational Skills 4


noun, _two fireflies_, you need to change the ‘y’ to ‘i’. After you do that, you can
add the ending – _es_ .”


 - Think aloud through the process as you write plural forms for the remaining
nouns that end with the letter ‘y’.

|Singular|Plural|
|---|---|
|frefy<br>butterfy<br>spy|frefies<br>butterfies<br>spies|



 - Ask students to read the word pairs aloud with you.


 - Point out that although you changed the ending of the word by changing the
‘y’ to ‘i’, the new spelling ‘ie’ still stands for the sound /ie/.


- **Digital Component 6.2**


 - Display Digital Component 6.2 and ask students to turn to Activity Page 6.2.


 - Guide students first through Part 1, helping them make all the singular nouns
plural by following the new spelling rule.


 - In Part 2, explain that some words ending in ‘y’ are verbs. We sometimes use
these verbs in sentences in a way that the /s/ sound needs to be added at
the end of the verb. Explain that the same spelling rule demonstrated earlier
with nouns ending in ‘y’ also applies when adding the /s/ sound or letter ‘s’ to
verbs ending in ‘y’: change the ‘y’ to ‘i’ and add – _es_ .


 - Ask students to read each verb in Part 2 and point out all the words ending in ‘y’.


 - Point to the first verb, _cry_, and say this is how we spell the word _cry_ as it is
used in the sentence: _Mary fell down and started to cry._


 - Now say a new sentence using the verb _cry_ and ask students to write that form
of the verb _cry_ on their activity page: _The baby cries when she is hungry._


 - Make sure students change the ‘y’ to ‘i’ before adding – _es_ .



Activity Page 6.2



Lesson 6 Tricky Spelling: Introduce ‘y’ › /y/, /i/, or /ie/
**85**


 - Guide students in reading and changing each remaining verb by using the
following sentences as examples.





**86**



**Note:** The addition of – _s_ to a verb in a sentence occurs in order to ensure
subject-verb agreement. It is not necessary for Grade 2 students to know the
name of this concept at this time. The focus in this lesson is on making sure
students understand the spelling rule about the need to change ‘y’ to ‘i’ and
then add – _es_, whenever the /s/ sound or letter ‘s’ is added to a word ending
in ‘y’.


 - Point out, once again, that although you changed ‘y’ to ‘i’, the new spelling ‘ie’
still stands for the sound /ie/.


 - Students should complete the back of the activity page independently
as practice.

Foundational Skills 4


- Summarize by pointing out the different ways plural nouns can be created:
some are formed by simply adding the ending – _s_, others by adding – _es_
(nouns ending in ‘s’, ‘x’, ‘z’, ‘sh’, and ‘ch’) and still others by changing ‘y’ to ‘i’
and then adding – _es_ .


- Tell students that today they will learn that some singular nouns are
exceptions to the general rule about adding the ending – _s_ or – _es_ to create
the plural form. Write the word _child_ on the board/chart paper. Ask a student
to read the word and make up a spoken sentence using the word _child_ . Write
his/her sentence on the board/chart paper, underlining the word _child_ . Ask
students whether the underlined noun _child_ means one or more than one
child. _(one child)_


- Choose another student, hold up two fingers and say, “Make up a new
sentence about two . . .” Pause and point to the underlined word _child_ . If the
student hesitates in providing a sentence, ask whether one would say “two
childs.” Guide the student in recognizing that the plural form of _child_ is not
_childs_, but _children_ .


- Write _children_ beside _child_ and explain that it is the plural of _child_ —or more
than one child. Tell students that sometimes, it is not possible to create the
plural form by simply adding – _s_, – _es_, or – _ies_ to words. Sometimes the entire
word and its spelling change in the plural form.


- Tell students they will be learning several of these irregular plural words
today and explain they must try to remember these plural forms. Repeat
the procedure with the following words.

**Preview Core Vocabulary**

  - Preview the following vocabulary with students:


**accent—n.,** the way a person might pronounce the sounds and words slightly
differently because he or she may have learned that language as a second

Example: When learning French, she spoke with an accent.


**shrug—n.,** the motion of raising one’s shoulders (as if you don’t know or are
asking a question) (44)

Example: If he did not know the answer he would shrug his shoulders.

/j/ /e/ /l/ * /o/ /t/ * /oe/ (46)

Example: Gelato is a delicious cold treat to have on a hot day.


**Sayings and Phrases**


**a winner never quits and a quitter never wins—** if you want to succeed at
something, don’t give up; keep trying (42)

  - Write the title “Dwight’s Lights” on the board/chart paper. Have students
read the titles out loud and remind them that this is the title of a of story
from _The Job Hunt._


  - Circle the ’s at the end of “Dwight’s.” Explain that ’s is often used in writing to
show ownership or that something belongs to somebody.


  - Point to the title “Dwight’s Lights,” noting that both words in the title are
nouns. The first noun with the apostrophe–‘s’ is the name of a person
( _Dwight’s_ ); the second noun is a thing (Lights).


  - By adding ’s to Dwight’s name, the writer shows that the lights belong to
Dwight. Dwight owns the lights!


  - Refer to the chart you prepared in advance. Explain that this chart has two
columns of words that are both lists of nouns. Ask students to read all of
the words in Column 1 and to then identify that these nouns—all people’s
names—are a specific type of noun called proper nouns.


  - Next ask students to read all the nouns in Column 2 and to identify that these
are all common nouns, names of places or things.

the end of Kurt.


 - Divide students into six groups. Ask each group to confer briefly to decide
which noun from Column 2 they want to pair with a name from Column 1.


 - At your signal, ask one person from each group to come to the board/chart
paper simultaneously to write the noun phrase chosen by his or her group.
Other students from each group should monitor their team member’s writing
to be sure that the ’s is inserted in the right place.


 - Review and discuss all written responses.


 - Have students take out Activity Page 7.2. Explain that on this activity page
they will make phrases by pairing a word from Column 1 (names people or
owners) with a word from Column 2 (things) to show ownership. Review the
example, pointing out the addition of ’s.

Spelling Tree for /oe/.


- Remind students that they have learned three different ways to spell the
/oe/ sound.


- To review, point to the ‘o_e’ branch and ask students to read three words
with the ‘o_e’ spelling. Next, point to the ‘oe’ branch and ask students to
read three words with the ‘oe’ spelling. Finally, point to the ‘o’ branch and
ask students to read three words with the ‘o’ spelling


- Be sure to remind students that in multisyllable words, the letter ‘o’ is
pronounced as /oe/ when it comes at the end of a syllable. Write the
following words on the board/chart paper, pointing to the ‘o’ at the end
of the first syllable and reading each word to reinforce this concept.


1. solar 2. open 3. over 4. oval


- Remind students that the multisyllable words in their books are not divided into
syllables, so when students are not sure where or how to divide a multisyllable
word with ‘o’ into syllables, they should try pronouncing the ‘o’ as either /oe/, as
in the open-syllable words previously listed, or /o/, as in the following words.


- Write the following words on the board/chart paper, pointing to each syllable
in which the ‘o’ is followed by a consonant (VCV), and reading each word with
the /o/ sound to reinforce this concept.


1. comic 2. model 3. rotten


- Refer back to the ‘o’ branch of the /oe/ Spelling Tree and ask students
whether the leaves presently attached to the branch are one-syllable or
multisyllable words. Explain that most of the time when ‘o’ is used as a
spelling for /oe/, it is used in multisyllable words. However, there are a
few one-syllable words with the /oe/ sound spelled with the letter ‘o’.


- Write the word _cold_ on the board/chart paper. Point to the letter ‘o’ and note that
it is followed by a consonant. Tell students they may think this word should be
sounded out as /k/ /o/ /l/ /d/ since the word _cod_ is sounded as /k/ /o/ /d/.


- Explain that in words ending with the spelling ‘old’, the ‘o’ is read as /oe/
instead of /o/. Point to the word _cold_ and guide students in sounding it out
as /k/ /oe/ /l/ /d/.


- Using the chart you prepared in advance or the digital version, guide
students in reading words 1–8.

- Underline ‘old’ as you read each word, pointing out the pattern.


- Explain there are other groups of one-syllable words in which the letter ‘o’
also represents the /oe/ sound. Write the word _roll_ on the board/chart paper,
underlining the spelling ‘oll’. Guide students in sounding out the word as /r/
/oe/ /l/, explaining that in the spelling ‘oll’, the ‘o’ is pronounced as /oe/. Ask
students to read words 9–11.











Challenge


Ask students to write
different one- and twosyllable words with the /oe/
spelling patterns to include
on the spelling trees.

 - Use the same procedures for the spelling ‘olt’ and words 12–14 and the
spelling ‘ost’ and words 15–17. As you read each word, point out the pattern.


 - Shuffle the leaves in which one-syllable words have the /oe/ sound spelled
with ‘o’. Have students read each word one at time. Next, ask a student to use
the word aloud in a sentence and then tape it on the correct branch of the
/oe/ Spelling Tree.

|**Key Idea and Key Details:** The key idea of “The<br>Diner” is to explain the types of jobs available in a<br>diner and the unique characteristics of a diner versus<br>other restaurants. Key details of the text include Kim<br>orders pancakes and explains to Kurt that diners have<br>pancakes available for order all day long, not just at<br>breakfast time. Kim explains the kinds of jobs needed<br>at a diner. Kim is offered a job as a dishwasher but as<br>the job lasts late into the night, Kim turns it down.|**Synopsis:** The story “The Diner” tells about Kim and<br>Kurt eating a meal in a diner. In the process of eating,<br>Kim inquires about a job and Kurt learns about the jobs<br>available in a diner as well as one unique aspect of a<br>diner menu.|

read each one:









Foundational Skills 4


 - Point out that the spelling ‘ow’ can also stand for /ou/ in the middle of words,
as well as at the end of some words. The spelling ‘ow’ is tricky, so when
students see it in a word, they should remember that there might be a tug of
war between the different sounds. They may need to try both pronunciations
and then decide which one makes the most sense in context.


 - Now show each of the prepared leaves with the ‘ow’ > /oe/ spellings, one at a
time, and read each word aloud as a class. Tape each word to the ‘ow’ branch
of the /oe/ Spelling Tree.


Check for Understanding


Choose a few words from the lesson (e.g., _row, how, show, clown, below, down_ ).

Encourage students to pay close attention to the vowel sounds in each of the words as

they say them aloud. Have students turn to a partner and decide if the vowels sound like

/oe/ as in _snow_ or /ow/ as in _now_ . Each student pair then shares their answer with the

class. Take note of students who are unsure or who incorrectly identify the vowels and

consider meeting with these students to practice.

it is about her subway ride from Brooklyn to Manhattan. Remind students that
Brooklyn and Manhattan are boroughs (a neighborhood consisting of a county,
cities, villages, and towns) in New York City, as students refer to the map on
page 3 of the reader. To get to Manhattan from Brooklyn, Kim and Kurt will take
a subway to go under a river.


  - Tell students that they will see the word “ _Street_ ” used in the story ( _Clark_
_Street_ ). Remind them that in Lesson 5, they learned how to abbreviate street.
Write _St._ on the board. Repeat with _Blvd._ / _Boulevard_, _Ave._ / _Avenue_, and _Pl_ ./
_Place_ . Remind students that when we write an abbreviation, we place a period
at the end. Point out that these abbreviations are usually capitalized because
they are part of proper nouns.

**Purpose for Reading**

 - Ask students to think about the modes of transportation they use to get to
different places: a car, a bus, an airplane, a bike, etc. Tell students when they
read “The Subway,” they should think of the ways the subway is similar to or
different from the modes of transportation they have used before.


~~**READ “THE SUBWAY” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Whole Group**

 - When Kurt says “Manhattan?” with a loud sigh, ask students to demonstrate
what a loud sigh sounds and looks like. Encourage students to re-read
_“Manhattan?”_ with expression.


 - When Kim explains that _sub_ - means under, tell students you are thinking
of another word that starts with _sub_  - something that goes underneath the
surface of water. Ask students if they can guess what you are thinking. _(A_
_submarine:_ marine _refers to the ocean and a submarine is a vessel that can_
_travel far down into the depths of the sea.)_


**Wrap-Up**

 - Use the following questions to guide discussion about the story. Remember
to encourage students to answer in complete sentences. When answering a
question, ask students to cite the part of the story that guided their answer.

 - Provide more practice for students to use syllable division patterns to
decode VCV words.


 - Write the word _below_ on the board/chart paper.


 - Say, “In _below_, I see two vowel sounds on either side of one consonant.”


 - Underline the vowel sounds.


 - Say, “When only one consonant comes between two vowels, I divide after the
first vowel sound. So I will divide the word like this: _be•low_ .”


~~**MORE HELP WITH ‘OW’**~~ ~~>~~ ~~**/OE/**~~

**Roll, Flip, Read**

 - Make one copy of **Activity Page TR 9.2** for each student. Number the back
of each card 1–12.


 - Have students lay cards facedown on the table or floor in front of them.


 - To play, either call out a number or have the student roll two dice, then “flip”
the card that corresponds to the number rolled and read the word on
the card.


 - If the student reads the word correctly, they may leave the card flipped over.
If they do not read it correctly, they flip it back over and their turn ends.


 - The first student to flip all the words wins.


 - An alternate way to play that does not involve dice is for each card to have a
preassigned point value based on the difficulty of the word.

~~**IRREGULAR PLURAL NOUNS (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students that they have been practicing how to change nouns from
singular to plural form. Write the following word pairs on the board/chart
paper. Note that the rules in parentheses are for teacher reference and
should not be copied.


 - Tell students that each pair shows the singular and plural form of a particular
noun. Ask a student to read the first pair. State the rule for how this singular
noun was transformed to a plural noun. After the rule for each pair is stated,
ask other students to provide several examples of other nouns in which the
plural is created in the same way.


 - Point out that all of these plural formations are considered “regular” because
they follow one of the three plural-formation rules. Remind students they
have already learned how to write and spell several irregular plural nouns.


 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 10.2.


 - Ask students to read the singular nouns, one at a time, and then say and
write the plural form of the same noun on their activity pages. After all
students have had time to try writing the plural noun independently, write
the correct plural form on the board/chart paper so students can check their
work. Prompt students to correct any spelling errors they may have made.
Provide time for students to write two sentences using these words.


Foundational Skills 4



**136**


 - Tell students they will learn several additional irregular plural formations
today. Write the word _shelf_ on the board/chart paper. Ask a student to read
the word aloud and to give you a sentence using the word _shelf_ . Write the
sentence on the board/chart paper, circling the word _shelf_ . Ask students
whether the circled noun _shelf_ refers to one shelf or more than one shelf.


 - Choose another student, hold up two fingers and say, “Make up a new
sentence about two . . .” pause and point to the circled word _shelf_ . If the
student hesitates in providing a sentence, ask whether, when talking about
two of this item, one would say “two shelfs.” Guide the student in recognizing
that the plural form of _shelf_ is not _shelfs_, but _shelves_ .


 - Write the word _shelf_ on the board/chart paper again and explain that in order
to create the plural of a noun that ends in the letter ‘f’, we change the ‘f’ to ‘v’
and then add ‘es’. Erase the letter ‘f’ and then write ‘ves’ with a different color
chalk or marker. Sound out the word with students.


 - Repeat the previous procedure with the word _wife_ . Explain that many times
when a word ends in ‘f’ or ‘fe’, it is necessary to change the ‘f’ or ‘fe’ to ‘v’ or
‘ve’, then add the _–s_ or _–es_ suffix. Repeat with the words _hoof_ ( _hooves_ ), _elf_
( _elves_ ), _half_ ( _halves_ ), and _calf_ ( _calves_ ). Remember to have students create
sentences aloud using the plural forms of the nouns.


 - Tell students to turn to Activity Page 10.3. Guide students in completing
several examples from each part of the activity page and then allow them
to complete the remaining items independently. Be sure students complete
both the front and back of this activity page.

already know another sound the letter ‘e’ can represent.


 - Write the following words on the board/chart paper beneath the heading ‘e’:










 - Ask students to read the words, pointing out the ‘e’ in these words represents
the /e/ sound. Point out that in words or syllables in which the ‘e’ stands for
/e/, the ‘e’ is followed by a consonant.


**Note:** Do not erase these words. You will refer to them again. Tell students
the letter ‘e’ is a tricky spelling because it can represent more than one
sound. They already know it can stand for /e/. Today they will learn words
in which ‘e’ can stand for the /ee/ sound.

 - Tell students to try breaking the word into syllables on their own, perhaps
trying both pronunciations to see what makes sense.


 - Write _lemon_ on the board/chart paper, but do not read the word aloud or ask
students to say the word at this time.

**Note:** If you are not able to display Digital Component 11.1, write the word _lemon_
on the board/chart paper as follows: “le mon.” Use the same teaching points
included in the bullets associated with Digital Component 11.1.


 - Say, “To make lemonade, you must squeeze a .”


 - Point to the syllables in the first word and model how to sound out the word
as it is divided. _Le mon_ is pronounced “/lee/ /mon/,” with the long vowel
/ee/ sound.


 - Now point to the second word _lem on_ and model sounding out the word as
it is divided: it is pronounced “/lem/ /on/” with the short vowel /e/ sound
because the ‘e’ is followed by a consonant.


 - Ask students which pronunciation makes sense and is a word they recognize.
( _lem on_ ) Circle _lem on_ and repeat the oral sentence, “To make lemonade, you
must squeeze a lemon.”


 - Review the spelling patterns for the long /e/ versus the short /e/ sound (i.e.,
‘e’ is pronounced /ee/ at the end of a syllable or word, but is pronounced /e/
when it is followed by a consonant within the syllable).


 - Repeat this procedure with the remaining words and sentences: write the
target word on the board/chart paper and then write two different ways it
can be broken into syllables. Use the word in a spoken sentence, alternately
pointing to and saying the /ee/ and /e/ sound. Ask students which word
makes sense and then circle the correct word.


 - Remind students that if the ‘e’ is followed by a consonant within the syllable,
it represents the /e/ sound; if it comes at the end of a syllable, it represents
the /ee/ sound.


**Note:** Do not write the sentences. You will read them aloud. Only write the
bolded words.

able, when their sound is
made in the word.





Lesson 11 Tricky Spelling: Introduce ‘e’ › /ee/ or /e/
**147**


Digital Component 11.2


Activity Pages 11.1


**148**




  - Remind students that the letter ‘e’ is a tricky spelling, which means it can
represent more than one sound. The letter ‘e’ as a tricky spelling creates a
“tug of war” between the /ee/ and /e/ sounds. When reading, students need
to practice breaking words into chunks, trying out the two different sounds,
and then choosing the sound and pronunciation that makes sense.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to look at the words on the board/chart paper and tell you in which

words the letter ‘e’ represents the /ee/ sound ( _secret_, _even_, _meter_, _demons_ ). Hand

out a blank spelling leaf to each student who correctly identifies a word in which

the ‘e’ stands for /ee/. Ask them to write the word on a leaf and then tape it to the

correct branch on the /ee/ Spelling Tree.


**Lesson 11: High Hill Letters**
10M
Writing


**Primary Focus:** Students will develop handwriting by accurately forming all cursive
letters using appropriate strokes when connecting letters. ~~**TEKS 2.2.E**~~


~~**CURSIVE: HIGH HILL LETTERS: UPPERCASE ‘M’ AND ‘N’ (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Print uppercase ‘M’ and ‘N’ on the board. Then slowly write each letter in
cursive underneath its printed counterpart.


  - Remind students that the lowercase ‘m’ and ‘n’ were known as Hill Letters
because of their shape. Tell them that the uppercase ‘M’ and ‘N’ are known as
the High Hill Letters because they are written by forming higher hills.


  - Write each letter again slowly, saying the words _high hill_ when writing the “hill
top” of the letters.


  - Direct students’ attention to Digital Component 11.2 and have them briefly
study the guiding arrows. Then stand facing away from the class and model
writing each letter in the air. Have students do the same.


**TEKS 2.2.E** Develop handwriting by accurately forming all cursive letters using appropriate strokes when connecting letters.


Foundational Skills 4


  - Model writing the High Hill Letters in cursive again, one at a time, on the board
or using a projector that permits students to see your hand movements. After
modeling each letter, have students trace and copy the letter on Activity Page 11.2.


  - Point out that:


    - the lowercase ‘m’ is written with three hills while the uppercase ‘M’ is
written with two high hills.


    - the lowercase ‘n’ is written with two hills while the uppercase ‘N’ is written
with one high hill.


  - Model writing a line or sentence from the activity page, having students copy
the words you model.


  - Have students complete the activity page. As they work, circulate to offer

**Purpose for Reading**

 - Ask students to read to learn more about banks and bankers on Wall Street
and some of the things they do.


~~**READ “WALL STREET” (10 MIN.)**~~


**Whole Group**

 - Have students read “Wall Street” together as a class. There are many options
for reading together as a class; select a method that best fits students.


 - Ask students to provide a good caption for the picture of Kurt imagining what
it might be like to open a store.

Encourage students to read with expression.


**Wrap-Up**

 - Use the following questions to guide discussion about “Wall Street”:



**EMERGENT**
**BILINGUAL**
**STUDENTS**


Reading


**Reading/Viewing**


Explain that in English
there is proper intonation
for asking questions.
When asking a question
that requires a yes or no
answer, the intonation
goes up at the end of
the question. Therefore
questions beginning with
_does_, _do_, _did_, _can_, and _is_
will go up in pitch. When
asking questions that
require information from
the listener, the intonation
goes down at the end of
the question. Therefore
questions beginning with
_who_, _what_, _were, when_,
_why_, and _how_ will go
down in pitch.


Beginning
Ask students to practice
asking yes/no questions
with the proper intonation.
(“Do you like this book?”
“Can I have a pencil?”)


Intermediate
Have students practice
asking both types of
questions with the proper
intonation. (“Is this your
favorite story?” “What story
did you like the most?”)


Advanced/
Advanced High
Ask students to practice
asking relevant questions
about the story with the
proper intonation. (“Do you
think Kim will find a job?”
“Who would need a loan?”)

as well as the Tricky Word _your_ . ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii; TEKS 2.2.C.i; TEKS 2.2.C.iv**~~


~~**INTRODUCE SPELLING WORDS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Write ‘ow’ on the board/chart paper and remind students that the ‘ow’
spelling can represent the /oe/ sound, especially when this sound occurs at
the end of words. Also remind them that the spelling ‘ow’ is tricky, so it can
also represent the /ou/ sound, usually in the middle or at the end of words.
Tell students the spelling words this week include words in which the ‘ow’
spelling represents either the /oe/ sound or the /ou/ sound.


  - Remind students to use what they have learned about decoding open
syllables when they spell words. Say, “In the word _below_ I hear the /ee/ sound,
so I know the word has an open syllable and will be spelled like this: _b e l o w_ .”


  - Write _below_ on the board. Draw a vertical line between _be_ and _low_ .


  - Have students take out the Individual Code Chart. Ask them to turn to the
page that has the /oe/ sound with the ‘ow’ spelling. _(page 8)_ Ask a student to
tell you the example word for the ‘ow’ spelling for /oe/. _(snow)_ Ask students
to tell you three other examples of words with the ‘ow’ spelling for /oe/.
Repeat these steps for the ‘ow’ spelling for /ou/. _(page 9; now)_


  - Write two columns on the board/chart paper with the headings ‘ow’ > /oe/
and ‘ow’ > /ou/. Write the spelling words in the appropriate columns.


**TEKS 2.2.B.iii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


We are exposed to many forms of persuasive communication on a daily
basis. Such communication may be nonverbal, verbal, or written, formal or
informal. Persuasive communication occurs whenever an individual attempts
to convince others to take a certain action, such as purchasing a certain
product or adopting a certain belief. Advertisements and commercials are
good examples of persuasive communication, but persuasive communication
can take more subtle forms and may be a part of letters, booklets,
newspaper articles, essays, and so on. In this lesson and those following,
students will learn about persuasive writing by writing a persuasive letter.

~~**DECODE, SPELL, AND USE WORDS WITH PREFIXES (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain to students that we can decode, or read, words with prefixes by
segmenting and blending the sounds and using the syllable chunking method.


 - Tell them that prefixes are word parts added to the beginning of a base word
to change the meaning of the word. Some prefixes include _un–_, _dis–_, _in–_, _re–_,
_pre_, _mis–_, _non–_, and _ex–_ . Each of these prefixes is one syllable.


 - Say, “Let’s focus on the prefix _re–_ first.”


 - Display some of the following words.


   - rewind, redo, reread, remix, remove, rerun, replay, retell, retake, repack,
rewire, reset, rename, respray, reappear


 - Say, “I see the prefix _re_ - /r/ /ee/. I am going to segment the rest of the word:
/w/ /ie/ /n/ /d/. Now I can blend the entire word: _re•wind_ .”


 - Pause between the syllables. Underline the _re–_ in _rewind_ .


 - Say, “ _Re•wind_ . There are two syllables. The prefix _re–_ is one of the syllables.”


 - Say the word again, clapping if needed to highlight the syllables. Repeat the
routine as needed with other words from the list.


 - Next, explain to students that prefixes change the meaning of the word. For
example, _wind_ becomes _rewind_ when we add the prefix _re–_, which means
“again” or “back.” _Rewind_ means “wind again.”


 - Say: “For words with prefixes, the spelling of the base word does not change
when the prefix is added.”


 - Finally, explain that when students come across a word with a prefix while
reading, breaking the word into its parts, prefix and base word, can help them
understand what the word means.


 - Point to the word _reappear_ on the board.


Foundational Skills 4


  - Say, “Let’s identify the meaning of this word by breaking it into its parts. I’m
going to draw a line between the prefix and the base word. Where should I
draw the line?” ( _after the prefix re–_ ).


  - Ask, “What is the base word?” ( _appear_ ) “What does the word _appear_ mean?”
( _to come into view_ )


  - Say, “If we add the prefix _re–_ at the beginning of _appear_, how does the
meaning of the word change?” ( _It means to come into view again._ )


  - For practice, have small groups use their own paper to create and identify
the meaning of words with the prefix _re–_ . Provide base words and have them
add prefixes. Have volunteers share their words and their meanings. Offer
feedback as needed.

**Note:** If you or students prefer to choose a different topic as the subject of
the persuasive letter to the principal, feel free to do so.




- Ask students to turn to Activity Page 12.2 as you display the enlarged version
you prepared in advance.


- Tell them they will use this planning template for persuasive letter writing to
organize their thoughts on the topic before they actually write the letter.


- Tell students that each piece of persuasive writing should start with an
opening sentence stating what it is that they want to happen (i.e., the goal or
purpose of this persuasive writing). In this case, the purpose might be, “We
would like french fries for lunch every day at school.” As you model writing
the opening sentence on the display copy of Activity Page 12.2, have students
copy the sentence on their activity pages.


- Tell students that in order to persuade someone to do something, they will need
to provide very convincing reasons why the other person should do what is
asked or proposed. Explain that people often mention specific facts or opinions
when they are providing reasons to persuade someone to do something.

- Explain that facts and opinions are not the same things:


  - Opinion—someone’s belief about something. For example, one person
might think chocolate ice cream is the best flavor, whereas another person
might think vanilla ice cream is the best.


  - Fact—a statement that can be checked or proven. For example, my house
is one mile from the school.


- Point out that although persuasive writing is most powerful if the writer can
provide facts as reasons why someone should do something, the reasons
given in a persuasive piece are often opinions (as is the case in many
advertisements and commercials).


- Encourage students to suggest reasons they might use to persuade the
principal they should have french fries every day. Here are a few ideas if
they need prompting:


  - French fries taste good.


  - Everyone likes french fries.


  - French fries are easy to make.


- Model writing three reasons on the display activity page as students write
three reasons on their own activity pages.


- Tell students it is effective to end persuasive writing with a sentence that sums
up and restates the purpose in a closing sentence. Model writing a closing
sentence as students add the closing sentence on their activity pages.

**Digital Component 12.5**




- Now that students have their persuasive writing ideas organized on paper,
ask them to turn to Activity Page 12.3 as you display the enlarged version you
prepared in advance. Explain that they will use Activity Page 12.3 as a class to
compose a friendly letter to the principal.


- Point out the Tricky Words on the letter template: _school_, _principal_,
and _sincerely_ .


- Explain that a friendly letter has very specific parts always placed on specific
areas of the page. On the display copy, point out and complete the heading,
greeting, and closing, using this specific terminology. (Do not complete
the body of the letter.) Tell students to complete their own activity page,
following along as you fill out the template in front of the whole class. Use
this opportunity to reinforce the capitalization of proper nouns in addresses,
dates, and titles.


- After these parts of the letter are complete, tell students they are now
ready to complete the main part of the letter, called the body of the letter.

the letter by copying the rest of their work from the persuasive writing
template to the body of the letter.


  - Then, direct students’ attention to the closing provided, _Sincerely,_ .
Tell students that closings are a way to bring the letter to an end. _Sincerely,_
is a fairly standard closing. You may also tell students the closing of a letter
depends on the person to whom the letter is addressed. A friendly letter to
a friend or relative might close with _Love,_ or _Very Truly Yours,_ .


  - Lastly, direct students to sign their own names on the signature line of
the template.


  - If time permits, encourage any students who finish writing their letter to refer
to Activity Page 12.4 to double-check their work with the editing checklist.

  - Five common nouns are chosen, and each player writes them down the left
side of the grid. (Examples include _superhero, river, town, holiday, month, day,_
_language, friend in class, teacher, restaurant,_ and _movie_ .)


  - Each player tries to fill in the grid with proper nouns that fit into the
categories. The goal is to score the most points by writing proper nouns that
other players don’t.


  - When time is up, players compare their answers. One point is scored for each
other player who does not have the same word.


  - The player with the most points wins.

common and proper nouns that are places, and, finally, two examples of
common and proper nouns that are things.


) **Digital Component 13.1**


  - Read each sentence as a class, explaining that these sentences include
words that have not been capitalized or punctuated correctly. Starting at the
beginning of the first sentence, ask students to identify each word that is a
proper noun as you draw a box around it.


  - As students identify each proper noun, ask students whether proper
nouns need to start with capital letters or lowercase letters. _(capital)_ After
capitalizing each title, ask students what punctuation mark needs to follow
the abbreviated title and add this as well. _(period)_


  - After capitalizing and punctuating proper nouns, look at the sentence as a
whole, reminding students that the first word of a sentence must be capitalized
and there must be end punctuation at the end of a sentence and add these.

Collect Activity Page 13.1 and review which students need additional support with

capitalization and punctuation of proper nouns, specifically regarding abbreviated

titles and possessives.


~~**DECODE, SPELL, AND USE WORDS WITH PREFIXES (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students of what they learned in Lesson 12 about decoding, or
reading, words with prefixes by segmenting and blending the sounds and
using the syllable chunking method.


 - Remind them that prefixes are word parts added to the beginning of a base
word to change the meaning of the word. Some prefixes include _un–_, _dis_ –,
_in_ –, _re_ –, _pre_, _mis_ –, _non_ –, and _ex_ –. Each of these prefixes is one syllable. In
this lesson they’ll focus on _re_  - again.


Foundational Skills 4


  - Write the word remix on the board/chart paper.


  - Say, “I see the prefix _re_  - /r/ /ee/. I am going to segment the rest of the word:
/m/ /i/ /x/. Now I can blend the entire word: _re•mix_ .”


  - Pause between the syllables. Underline the _re–_ in _remix_ .


  - Say, “Re•mix. There are two syllables. The prefix _re_  - is one of the syllables.”


  - Say the word again, clapping if needed to highlight the syllables. Repeat the
routine as needed with other words from the list.


  - Next, remind students that prefixes change the meaning of the word. For
example, _mix_ becomes _remix_ when we add the prefix _re–_, which means
“again” or “back.” _Remix_ means “mix again.” Explain that students can spell
other new words by adding prefixes to the base words.


  - Say, “For words with prefixes, the spelling of the base word does not change
when the prefix is added.”


  - Finally, remind students that when they come across a word with a prefix
while reading, breaking the word into its parts, prefix and base word, can help
them understand what the word means.


  - Write the word _remake_ on the board/chart paper.


  - Say, “Let’s identify the meaning of this word by breaking it into its parts. I’m
going to draw a line between the prefix and the base word. Where should I
draw the line?” ( _after the prefix re–_ ).


  - Ask, “What is the base word?” ( _make_ ) “What does the word make mean?” ( _to_
_put something together_ )


  - Say, “If we add the prefix _re–_ at the beginning of make, how does the meaning
of the word change?” ( _It means to make something again._ )


  - For practice, have small groups use their own paper to practice creating and
identifying the meaning of words with the prefix _re_ –. Provide base words
and have them add prefixes. Have volunteers share their words and their
meanings. Offer feedback as needed.

**Primary Focus:** Students will complete fill-in-the-blank sentences with the correct
form of the present tense of the verb _to be_ and identify present-tense forms of the
verb _to be_ in written sentences. ~~**TEKS 2.11.D.i; TEKS 2.11.D.ii**~~

~~**TEKS 2.2.B.vi; TEKS 2.2.C.vi; TEKS 2.3.C**~~


~~**INTRODUCE VERB TO BE (20 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** Before introducing _to be_ as a verb, it will be helpful for students to
have a very basic understanding of verb conjugation; it is not necessary,
however, for students to know or use the term _conjugation_ .


This lesson will introduce the concept of conjugation with a review of
present-tense action verbs first. The second part of the lesson will introduce
students to present-tense forms of _to be_ as a verb.


  - Direct students’ attention to the chart with action verb sentences that you
prepared in advance.


) **Digital Component 14.1**



Explain that the verb
_to be_ is used in many
ways in English. The
most common ways
are to express qualities
(beautiful, smart, tall),
emotions (happy, sad,
excited), roles (teacher,
sister, president), and
location (at lunch, in the
class, on the playground).

Give a few examples of
present-tense verbs. (We

Check for Understanding


Read the sentences out loud and ask students to listen for the verb in each sentence.

When you say the verb, have them wiggle their hands.


 - Ask students to read each group of sentences and identify the action verb
in each sentence as you underline it with a wiggly line. Point out that the
action verb in each group is the same, though it may change form slightly
depending on who is performing the action in each sentence. For example,
when we use the words _I, you, we,_ or _they_ with the action verb _run_, we say _I_
_run, you run, we run,_ or _they run_ . But when we use the words _he_ or _she_ with
_run_, we say _he_ _runs_ or _she_ _runs_ .


 - Repeat the process with the remaining groups of sentences in the first chart.


 - Explain that students are going to learn a new kind of verb that is not an action
verb but is still a verb. Write the following sentence on the board: He is glad.


 - Explain to students that the verb in this sentence is not an action word.
The verb in this sentence is _is_ . Draw a wiggly line under _is_ . Ask students
who the sentence is about, i.e., who is glad? _(he)_ Explain that the verb _is_ is
about _he_ but it does not show action, like _runs_ or _jumps_ . It is one form of the
special verb _to be._


 - Direct students’ attention to the chart with verb _to be_ sentences.


) **Digital Component 14.2**


 - Ask students to read the first group of sentences. Underline each form of
the verb _to be_ with a wiggly line and point out that this is the verb in the
sentence. Continue with the other groups of sentences, but now ask students
to identify the verb in each sentence as you underline it with a wiggly line.

Collect Activity Page 14.1 and note which students will need additional support with

the present tense of the verb _to be._


~~**DECODE, SPELL, AND USE WORDS WITH PREFIXES (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students of what they learned in previous lessons about decoding,
or reading, words with prefixes by segmenting and blending the sounds and
using the syllable chunking method.


 - Remind them that prefixes are word parts added to the beginning of a base word
to change the meaning of the word. In this lesson they’ll focus on _re–_ again.


 - Write the word _replay_ on the board/chart paper.


 - Say, “I see the prefix _re–_ /r/ /ee/. I am going to segment the rest of the word:
/p/ /l/ /ae/. Now I can blend the entire word: _re•play_ .”


 - Pause between the syllables. Underline the _re–_ in _replay_ .


 - Say, “ _Re•play_ . There are two syllables. The prefix _re–_ is one of the syllables.”


 - Say the word again, clapping if needed to highlight the syllables. Repeat the
routine as needed with other words from the list.


 - Next, remind students that prefixes change the meaning of the word. For
example, _play_ becomes _replay_ when we add the prefix _re–_, which means
“again” or “back.” _Replay_ means “play again.” Explain that students can spell
other new words by adding prefixes to the base words.


 - Say, “For words with prefixes, the spelling of the base word does not change
when the prefix is added.”


 - Finally, remind students that when they come across a word with a prefix
while reading, breaking the word into its parts, prefix and base word, can help
them understand what the word means.


 - Write the word review on the board/chart paper.


 - Say, “Let’s identify the meaning of this word by breaking it into its parts. I’m
going to draw a line between the prefix and the base word. Where should I draw
the line?” ( _after the prefix re–_ ).

  - Ask, “What is the base word?” ( _view_ ) “What does the word view mean?”
( _to see_ )


  - Say, “If we add the prefix _re–_ at the beginning of view, how does the meaning
of the word change?” ( _It means to see again._ )


  - For practice, have small groups use their own paper to practice creating and
identifying the meaning of words with the prefix _re–_ . Provide base words
and have them add prefixes. Have volunteers share their words and their
meanings. Offer feedback as needed.

Example: The Cubs are “down by two runs” after that hit.


**They don’t like the call.—** the fans do not like the umpire’s decision about
the play (66)

Example: “They don’t like the call” and are arguing with the umpire.

~~**READ “THE DAYDREAM” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Reading**

**Note:** As the story “The Daydream” relies heavily upon an understanding of
the game of baseball and terms unique to baseball, it is recommended that you
consider a shift in the procedures typically used when there are reading lessons.
Rather than have students partner read the story first, conduct a careful reading
lesson first so you will have an opportunity to scaffold and discuss with students
the meaning of the many baseball terms in the context of the story. Lead students
in a careful reading of the text by doing the following:


 - Lead students in a careful reading of the text by doing the following:


   - asking text-dependent questions that require students to draw on
evidence from the text;


   - identifying and discussing general academic (Tier 2) vocabulary;


   - discussing sections of the text that might pose difficulty due to complex
syntax, dense information, challenging transitions, or that require
inferences; and


   - engaging students in a culminating writing activity completed
independently, if possible.


 - There are many ways for students to respond to the questions you present
and you may want to change the way in which you ask for students’
responses in each lesson or even during the lesson to improve student
engagement. During this lesson, ask all students to write a response to each
question, then ask an individual student to respond aloud.

  - Divide students into two teams. Give each team a token or playing piece.


  - Have one team at a time line up. Each team takes a turn “at bat” as follows:


    - Pick a card from the pile and ask the first person on the team to read it.
If the word is read correctly, draw a line from home plate to first base,
signifying a “hit.” This player should go to the back of his team’s line, while
the next player comes forward to read the next card. If he or she reads the
word correctly, draw a line from first to second base. Play continues in this
way, so that each time a player reads a word correctly a line is drawn to the
next base. If the fourth player reads the word correctly, draw a line from
third base to home plate and mark “1 run” for this team. Play continues by

the members of this team so long as no words are misread. When a word is
misread, the next team takes its turn at bat.


  - Set a timer for ten minutes and tell students that whichever team has
the most runs when the timer rings is the winning team. Point out that
accuracy is important, but so is speed. The more turns players have to
read words, the more likely their team is to score runs.


- Just as in the actual game of baseball, any players “left on base” when a word
is misread do not count or add to the score.

 - Print uppercase ‘W’ and ‘Y’ on the board. Then slowly write each letter in
cursive underneath its printed counterpart.


 - Remind students that several lowercase letters were known as the Valley
Letters because of their shape. Remind them that the uppercase ‘U’, ‘V’, ‘W’,
and ‘Y’ are known as the Deep Valley Letters because they are written by
forming deeper valleys than those formed in writing the lowercase letters.


 - Tell students that, today, they will be learning ‘W’ and ‘Y’.


 - Write each letter again slowly, saying the words _deep valley_ when writing the
“valley bottom” of the letters.


 - Direct students to Activity Page 16.1. Then stand facing away from the class
and model writing each letter in the air. Have students do the same.


 - Model writing the Deep Valley Letters in cursive again, one at a time, on the board
or using a projector that permits students to see your hand movements. After
modeling each letter, have students trace and copy the letter on Activity Page 16.1


   - If possible, project Digital Component 15.1 to model writing the letters.


 - Model writing a line or sentence from the activity page, having students copy
the words you model.


 - Have students complete the activity page. As they work, circulate to offer
assistance in forming and connecting the letters.


 - Encourage students whose names begin with an uppercase letter that they
have learned to write their names in cursive at the top of the activity page,
starting with an uppercase letter.

**Primary Focus:** Students will read and spell one-syllable and multisyllabic words
with VCe syllables and digraphs /ee/ > ‘e_e’, /ee/ > ‘ee’, /ee/ > ‘e’, /ee/ > ‘ea’, and
the Tricky Word _people_ . ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii; TEKS 2.2.C.i**~~


Students will decode, spell, and use words with the prefix _re–_ .

~~**TEKS 2.2.B.vi; TEKS 2.2.C.vi; TEKS 2.3.C**~~


~~**INTRODUCE SPELLING WORDS (10 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.2.C.i**~~


  - Write /ee/ on the board/chart paper. Tell students the spelling words this
week all have the /ee/ sound spelled in four ways: ‘e_e’, ‘ee’, ‘ea’, and ‘e’.


  - Make four columns on the board/chart paper with the headings: ‘e_e’, ‘ee’,
‘ea’, and ‘e’. Write the spelling words in the appropriate columns.


  - The spelling words for this week are as follows.

|‘e_e’ > /ee/|‘ee’ > /ee/|‘e’ > /ee/|‘ea’ > /ee/|
|---|---|---|---|
|eve<br>complete|creek<br>week<br>meeting|she<br>we<br>fever<br>zero<br>pretend|squeak<br>meal<br>wheat<br>seal|



  - Read each of the words aloud with students, focusing on the specific
spellings in each word. Tell students the Tricky Word for this week is _people_ .


  - Remind students to practice their spelling words at home each night with a
family member.


**TEKS 2.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (iii) decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open
syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables;
(vi) decoding words with prefixes, including un-, re-, and dis-, and inflectional endings, including s, -es, -ed, -ing, -er, and
-est; **TEKS 2.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling one-syllable and multisyllabic words with closed
syllables; open syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final

**211**


**212**



~~**SPELLING WORDS**~~


 - Remind students of what they learned in previous lessons about decoding,
or reading, words with prefixes by segmenting and blending the sounds and
using the syllable chunking method.


 - Remind them that prefixes are word parts added to the beginning of a base word
to change the meaning of the word. In this lesson they’ll focus on _re–_ again.


 - Write _rerun_ on the board/chart paper.


 - Say, “I see the prefix _re–_ /r/ /ee/. I am going to segment the rest of the word:
/r/ /u/ /n/. Now I can blend the entire word: _re•run_ .”


 - Next, remind students that prefixes change the meaning of the word. For
example, _run_ becomes _rerun_ when we add the prefix _re–_, which means
“again” or “back.” _Rerun_ means “run again.” Explain that the spelling of the
base word does not change when the prefix is added.


 - Have small groups use their own paper to practice spelling and identifying
the meaning of words with the prefix _re–_ .

~~**REVIEW VOWEL SOUNDS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - You will review three sets of vowel sounds with students. The purpose of this
is to focus student attention on the difference between various vowel sounds.
For each set, follow these steps:


    - Write the sounds and their corresponding numbers on the
board/chart paper.


    - Say the words provided one at a time.


    - Have students repeat the word after you, say the vowel sound, and raise
their fingers to represent the correct corresponding vowel sound. For
example, if the short vowel /a/ sound was number ‘1’ and you said the
word _cat_, students would raise one finger to show they heard the short
vowel /a/ sound.


  - Tell students some of the words have more than one syllable. Tell them when
there is more than one syllable, and therefore more than one vowel sound, you
will let them know which syllable and vowel sound you want them to focus on:
the first syllable and vowel sound or the last syllable and vowel sound.


  - For the first set of words, write /ee/ = 1 and /e/ = 2 on the board. Point to and
say each sound.

Foundational Skills 4


- Tell students they are to listen only for the long /ee/ or the short /e/ sounds.
Say the following words aloud one at a time while alternately pointing to /ee/
and /e/. Ask students to repeat the word, say the vowel sound, and then raise
either one or two fingers. Remind students to raise one finger if they hear the
long /ee/ sound and two fingers if they hear the short /e/ sound.


- Say the following words with the /ee/ and /e/ sound. You should tell students
_lemon_ and _before_ are two-syllable words. They should listen to the first
syllable and vowel sound. You may also pause after saying the first syllable
to accentuate the syllable and the vowel sound.










- Tell students that for the next set of words, they are to listen for the
following sounds: /oe/, /o/, and /ow/. Write /oe/ = 1, /o/ = 2, and /ow/ =
3 on the board/chart paper. Say the following words aloud one at a time
while alternately pointing to /oe/, /o/, and /ow/. Ask students to repeat the
word, say the vowel sound, and then raise one, two, or three fingers. Remind
students to raise one finger if they hear the long /oe/ sound, two fingers if
they hear the short /o/ sound, and three fingers if they hear the /ou/ sound.


- Say the following words with the /ou/, /oe/, and /o/ sounds. You should tell
students _totem_ and _shower_ are two-syllable words. They should listen to
the first syllable and vowel sound. You may also pause after saying the first
syllable to accentuate the syllable.










  - Tell students that for the last set of words, they are to listen for either the
/ ie/ sound or the /i/ sound. Write /ie/ = 1, /i/ = 2 on the board/chart paper.
Say the following words, one at a time, while alternately pointing to /ie/
and /i/. You should tell students _item_ and _igloo_ are two-syllable words. They
should listen to the first syllable and vowel sound. You may also pause after
saying the first syllable to accentuate the syllable.

Check for Understanding


Make note of any students who respond incorrectly as they raise their fingers to

indicate which sound they heard.


~~**INTRODUCE /EE/ › ‘Y’ AND ‘EY’ (15 MIN.)**~~


**Review Tricky Spelling ‘y’**

 - Display the Vowel Code Flip Book and have the Spelling Cards listed in the
Lesson at a Glance readily available.


 - Tell students they are going to learn some additional sounds the letter ‘y’ can
represent, but you will first review the three sounds they have already learned
for the letter ‘y’: one is a consonant sound and two are vowel sounds.


 - Ask students to refer to the Individual Code Chart. Tell students, “When I say
‘go,’ I want you to quickly find a sound we have learned represented by the
letter ‘y’. Remember the sounds and spelling we have learned are already
outlined by colored marker. It will be easiest if you look at the sample words
on the cards of your charts to find words with the letter ‘y.’ Raise your hand
when you have found a word with the spelling ‘y’ we have already learned.
Ready, set, go!”


 - Call on a student who has found a ‘y’ spelling. Ask the student to tell others
on which page their spelling (and sound) is located, and have all students
turn to that page in the Individual Code Chart. Ask the student to say the
sound the letter ‘y’ stands for and read the sample word.


 - Write the sound the student has identified on the board. Then write the three
example words from the box below beside the sound.


 - Repeat these steps for the other two ‘y’ spellings and sounds.

~~**READ “THE BAKERY” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Reading**

 - After students have finished reading “The Bakery” with their partners, lead
students in a careful reading of the text by doing the following:


   - ask text-dependent questions which require students to draw on evidence
from the text;


   - identify and discuss general academic (Tier 2) vocabulary;


   - discuss sections of the text that might pose difficulty due to complex
syntax, dense information, challenging transitions, or that might
require inferences; and


   - engage students in a culminating writing activity completed
independently, if possible.


   - There are many ways for students to respond to the questions you present
and you may want to change the way in which you ask for students’
responses in each lesson, or even during the lesson, to improve student
engagement. During this lesson, ask all students to write a response to
each question, then ask an individual student to respond aloud.

**Lesson 18: Change ‘y’ to ‘i’ and Add –es**
25M
Language


**Primary Focus:** Students will write the inflectional ending – _s_ and – _es_ to singular
nouns to form plural nouns and will change ‘y’ to ‘i’ when adding – _es_ to the end of
nouns and verbs. ~~**TEKS 2.2.C.i; TEKS 2.2.C.iv; TEKS 2.2.C.vi**~~


~~**CHANGE ‘Y’ TO ‘I’ AND ADD –ES (10 MIN.)**~~

plural noun.


  - Write _dog_ on the board/chart paper. Ask students how they would make _dog_
plural. _(add –_ s _)_ Write _dogs_ beside _dog_ and underline ‘s’.


  - Write _box_ on the board/chart paper. Ask students how they would make _box_
plural. _(add –_ es _)_ Write _boxes_ beside _box_ and underline ‘es’.


  - Remind students of the rule they learned about how to change singular
nouns to plural nouns when the word ends in the letter ‘y’ and represents the
/ie/ sound.


  - Write the word _butterfly_ on the board/chart paper and ask students to read it.
Say the sentence, “On Monday, I saw one butterfly.”


  - Say the sentence, “On Tuesday, I saw three butterflies.” Point to the word
_butterfly_ on the board/chart paper and tell students the spelling for _butterfly_
has to change now that there is more than one.


**TEKS 2.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling one-syllable and multisyllabic words with closed

**235**


**EMERGENT**
**BILINGUAL**
**STUDENTS**


Language


**Using Verbs and Verb Phrases**


Before proceeding with
changing the ‘y’ to an ‘i’ and
adding – _es_ to verbs, remind
students why we add an – _s_
to some verbs.


   - A verb is a word that
shows action or
something you can do.


- If the action is being done
by one person, the verb
ends with the letter ‘s’.


  - Kurt rides the subway.


    - Kim looks for a job.


   - The baker gives Kurt
a muffin.


     - Explain that the
same spelling rule
demonstrated previously
with nouns ending in ‘y’
also applies when adding
the /s/ sound (or letter
‘s’) to verbs ending in ‘y’:
change the ‘y’ to ‘i’ and
add – _es_ .


Beginning
Have the students repeat
after you: “Kim tries to
find a job.”


Intermediate
Allow the students to try to
change the verb correctly:
Kurt (carry) the bag.


Advanced/
Advanced High
Have the students create
a sentence about Kim and
Kurt studying the subway
map using the correct
verb. ( _studies_ )


~~**ELPS 1.F; ELPS 5.D**~~


**236**




- Carry out the following steps, saying them aloud so students can be
reminded of the spelling rule for forming plural nouns ending in ‘y’ as /ie/:
change the ‘y’ to ‘i’ and add – _es_ . (Write the word _butterflies_ next to _butterfly_
and leave both words on the board/chart paper.)


- Write the word _supply_ on the board and ask students to read it. Say the
sentence, “We have a small supply of food.” Next, say the sentence, “They bought
many different _supplies_ at the store.” Have students tell you the spelling rule for
changing the singular noun _supply_ to the plural noun _supplies_ . (Write the word
_supplies_ next to _supply_ and leave both words on the board/chart paper.)


- Point to and read both word pairs, explicitly pointing out that the ‘y’ at the end
of the word represents the /ie/ sound in the singular form of the noun, so the
‘ie’ in the plural form of the noun also represents the /ie/ sound.


- Write the word _play_ on the board/chart paper. Point out that it ends in the
letter ‘y’ but it has the letter ‘a’ in front of the ‘y’.


- Tell students whenever ‘y’ is preceded by a vowel, they do not change
anything at all but simply add – _s_ .


- Write the following words on the board/chart paper and ask students
whether or not they need to change the ‘y’ to make the word plural.






 - Write the following singular nouns on the board/chart paper. Have students
read each of the words, noting that in these words, the ‘y’ at the end of the
word is pronounced /ee/:

|Singular|Plural|
|---|---|
|story<br>lady<br>fairy|stories<br>ladies<br>fairies|



 - Tell students that these singular nouns ending in ‘y’ follow the same spelling
rule: change the ‘y’ to ‘i’ and add – _es_ . Carry out the steps to change these
nouns from singular to plural, saying the steps aloud. Be sure to write the
plural form next to each singular noun.


Foundational Skills 4


**Note:** The addition of ‘s’ to a verb in a sentence occurs in order to ensure
subject-verb agreement. It is not necessary for Grade 2 students to know the
name of this process at this time. The focus in this lesson is on making sure
students understand the spelling rule about the need to change ‘y’ to ‘i’ and
then add – _es_, whenever the letter ‘s’ is added to a word ending in ‘y’.


  - Point to and read word pairs on the board/chart paper, explicitly pointing
out that the ‘y’ at the end of these words represents the /ee/ sound in the
singular form of the noun, so the ‘ie’ in the plural form of the noun now
represents the /ee/ sound (i.e., the same original sound as the ‘y’). Students
have previously learned to pronounce ‘ie’ as /ie/, so this means they must
now treat ‘ie’ as a tricky spelling because it can sometimes stand for /ee/.


  - Remind students that some words ending in ‘y’ are verbs and that we
sometimes use these verbs in sentences in a way that requires the /s/
sound to be added at the end of the verb. Explain that the same spelling rule
demonstrated previously with nouns ending in ‘y’ also applies when adding the
/s/ sound (or letter ‘s’) to verbs ending in ‘y’: change the ‘y’ to ‘i’ and add – _es_ .


  - Follow the same steps for the verbs _cry_ and _dry_ : write each word on the
board/chart paper and use it in a spoken sentence, then use the word
in another spoken sentence in which the subject changes and therefore
requires a change in the form of the verb. Ask students to tell you how to
change the word by following the spelling rule. Write the new verb form next
to the original.


  - For the word _cry_, use the following sentences: “I cry when I scrape my knee.”
and “She always cries at sad movies.”


  - For the word _dry_, use the following sentences: “Did you dry the dishes?” and
“He dries the dishes after they have been washed.”


  - Point out again that when you change ‘y’ to ‘i’, the new spelling ‘ie’ stands for
the sound /ie/, just as the ‘y’ at the end of these verbs originally did.


  - Repeat these same steps for the verbs _carry_ and _study_ in which the ‘y’
represents the /ee/ sound: write each word on the board, use it in a spoken
sentence, then use the word in another spoken sentence in which the
subject changes and therefore requires a change in the form of the verb.
Ask students to tell you how to change the word by following the spelling
rule. Write the new verb form next to the original.


  - For the word _carry_, use the following sentences: “The women carry heavy
loads on the top of their heads.” and “He carries his tools in a backpack.”


  - For the word _study_, use the following sentences: “Did you study for your
test?” and “He studies for his spelling tests every Thursday night.”

Activity Page 18.3


Reader


Page 82




  - Explicitly point out that in these words the ‘y’ at the end of the words
represents the /ee/ sound, so when the spelling changes to ‘ie’, the ‘ie’ now
represents the /ee/ sound (i.e., the same original sound as the ‘y’).

**Primary Focus:** Students will complete fill-in-the-blank sentences with the correct
form of the present or past tense of the verb _to be_ .


~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii; TEKS 2.11.D.ii; TEKS 2.11.D.vii**~~


~~**REVIEW ACTION VERBS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Using the Wiggle Cards, review action verbs.


  - Remind students that an action verb is a word conveying or showing action
or movement. Display a Wiggle Card to the entire class.


  - Ask them to read the Wiggle Card.


  - Call on a student to identify the action verb on the Wiggle Card.


  - Ask all students to perform the action.


~~**PRESENT AND PAST TENSE OF TO BE (30 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that several days ago they learned a new verb that is not
an action word, but is still a verb. This verb, _to be_, has several different forms
that can be used in sentences, depending on how the sentence begins.


  - Point to the present tense chart you prepared in advance. Tell students that
each sentence starts with a subjective pronoun. Remind students of what
they have learned about pronoun cases in previous lessons.

Foundational Skills 4


 - Point to and read _am_, _are_, and _is_, reminding students that these are forms of
the verb _to be_ that they learned several days ago. Now point to each of the
other words in rapid order, starting with _I_, telling students to say the word you
point to and fill in the blank aloud with the proper form of _to be_ (e.g., _I_ _am,_
_you are, we are_ ).


 - Tell students you would like them to do the same thing again, but this time,
they should add the following phrase at the end of each verb: _happy today_ .
Point in rapid order, starting with _I am happy today_, _You are happy today_, etc.


 - Tell students that this time when you point, you want them to add the phrase
_hungry right now_ at the end. Ask them to pay careful attention because this
time you will point to the words beginning the sentence in random order;
start with _they_ (are hungry right now) and continue in random order.


 - Explain that the words _am_, _are_, and _is_ are all forms of the verb _to be_ in what
is called “the present tense.” These verbs tell something is happening in the
present, which means it is happening now. Repeat “I am happy today” and
“I am hungry right now” with emphasis on the bolded words to reinforce the
idea the present tense is happening now.


 - Tell students it is also possible to use the verb _to be_ to describe things that
have already happened in the past; this is called “the past tense.” Tell them
that today they will learn some forms of the verb _to be_ in the past tense.


 - Point to the present tense chart you prepared in advance.




  - Follow the same steps described earlier, asking students to complete each
sentence aloud with the appropriate form of the past tense as you point to
a word at the beginning. Emphasize these forms of the verb _to be_ are in the
past tense.


Lesson 19 Grammar: Present and Past Tense of the Verb: to be

 - Compare the present and past tenses of _to be_ aloud in the following
sentences, asking students to first identify the verb and then say whether

~~**INTRODUCE THE STORY (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that the title of today’s story is “The Grocery.” Ask them to look in
the table of contents and tell you the page where the story begins. _(page 88)_


  - Ask students to think about the story “The Florist” and name some
describing words (adjectives) about Hester’s personality. Write them on
the board ( _mean_, _cranky_, _rude_, etc.). Now ask students for antonyms of the
words they provided for Hester and also write them on the board ( _kind_, _nice_,
_happy_, _polite_, etc.). Tell students that the owner of the grocery store,
Mr. Fremont, has a very different personality than Hester, so the antonyms
they just provided will most likely describe Mr. Fremont.

complete fill-in-the-blank sentences with words containing these features.


~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii; TEKS 2.2.C.i; TEKS 2.2.C.iv**~~


~~**SOUND/SPELLING REVIEW (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Play a game of “I Spy” with the Vowel Code Flip Books.


  - You might say something like this: “I spy a spelling for /ee/. Who can find a
spelling for /ee/?”


  - You could continue directing the game or let the student who correctly points
to the spelling make the next “I Spy” statement.


~~**INTRODUCE /AW/ › ‘AL’ (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Turn to **Vowel Code Flip Book page 17** .


  - Display the /aw/ Spelling Tree and remind students that in Unit 3, they
learned several ways to spell the /aw/ sound. Ask students to refer to the
various branches in order to identify the different spellings of /aw/ they have
already learned: ‘aw’, ‘au’, and ‘augh’. Have students read several words from
each branch as a quick review.


  - Point to the new branch you have added to the tree and tell students that
today they will learn an additional spelling for /aw/: ‘al’.


  - Write the spelling ‘al’ on the board/chart paper and ask, “If you saw this
spelling in a word, what sound would you say?” (Students may be able to
deduce they should say /aw/. If not, point to the ‘a’ and ‘l’ and tell students
that sometimes this spelling, ‘al’, is pronounced /aw/.)


  - Tell students that when they see the letters ‘al’, they should recognize
these letters are working together as a digraph, or letter team, and say the
sound /aw/.


  - Write the following words on the board, circle the ‘al’ spelling for /aw/, and
have students read them aloud:


**TEKS 2.2.B.iii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open
syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables;
**TEKS 2.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling one-syllable and multisyllabic words with closed
syllables; open syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final
stable syllables (iv) spelling multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns.

- Show students the Spelling Card for ‘al’ > /aw/ ( _wall_ ). Have students read the
sample word. Discuss the power bar. Point out that the power bar does not
stretch all the way across the card. This means there are some other spellings
for this sound. Add the Spelling Card to Vowel Code Flip Book page 17.


- Ask students to turn to **Individual Code Chart page 9** . Have them outline
the following card in green:








 - Distribute the previously written leaves to student pairs or trios. For each leaf
ask them to circle the spelling for /aw/, read the word to the rest of the class,
and then tape the leaf on the appropriate branch.


Check for Understanding


**Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down:** One at a time, read words with and without the /aw/

sound. Have students put their thumbs up when you say a word with the /aw/ sound

and have them put their thumbs down when you say a word without the /aw/ sound.



Support


Show students the images
of a walrus and a walnut.


Challenge


Ask students if they can
think of any words that
have the ‘al’ spelling.

~~**INTRODUCE THE STORY (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students the title of today’s story is “Inventory.” Ask them to look in the
table of contents and tell you the page on which the story begins. _(page 94)_


  - Ask students to summarize what happened in the previous story, “The
Grocery.” Tell students that today they will find out what kind of test Mr.
Fremont has in mind for Kim.


  - Tell students that they will see the abbreviation Mr. used in the story (Mr.
Fremont). Remind students that using the word mister or missus before a
person’s name is usually a way of showing respect. Explain that when we
abbreviate these words to go before a person’s name, we write it Mr. and Mrs.
Write these on the board and have students say mister and missus with you.

When you finish all the assessments in Lessons 22–25, it is strongly
recommended that the Grade 2 teachers meet as a grade level to globally
examine student progress and consider any adjustments that may need to
be made to groups across the grade level.


Consider setting up a few stations for students to relax and practice skills
over the next few assessment days.


   - game station using games from additional supports throughout the unit


   - listening station


   - writing station to write letters or draw pictures for Mr. Mowse


   - special comfy reading space

that the word _tally_ means to count or add things up. Tell students they will
continue reading about Kim and her job hunt in this story. Ask students to
recall where Kim was in the last story. _(at a grocery store)_


  - Tell students they must first read this story. After reading the story, students
should complete Activity Page 22.1. They may refer to the Reader as needed
to complete the questions.


Activity Page 22.1: Reading Comprehension Assessment


Collect Activity Page 22.1 and use the Reading Comprehension Record Sheet

Analysis chart found in Teacher Resources to record and analyze students’ scores.


**Analysis**

  - Record students’ results on the Reading Comprehension Record Sheet. Put a
check mark for each correctly answered item.


  - Follow the directions on the Reading Comprehension Analysis chart to sort
students into groups for an activity in Lesson 23.


    - Students who are listed in Column B of the Reading Comprehension
Analysis chart will work on an activity in Pausing Point Activity Pages PP.44
and PP.45. This activity will help them understand that there are logical
answers to each question based on author information and their
own thinking.


**TEKS 2.6.G** Evaluate details read to determine key ideas.


Foundational Skills 4



**272**


  - For students who are listed in Column C, it is strongly suggested that you
find time the next day to have these students work with you individually
in a quiet area to retake the assessment. You may want to make a copy
of “The Tally” from the Reader, so you can complete an anecdotal record,
noting any reading errors, as students read the story aloud to you. Also,
ask students to read the comprehension questions and explain why they
selected the particular answers they chose. By reviewing errors made
while reading aloud, in conjunction with students’ explanation of their
answers to the comprehension questions, you should be able to get a
more accurate idea of whether the difficulty a student is experiencing is
the result of poor decoding skills or poor comprehension or perhaps a
combination of both.


- In any event, students who performed poorly on this assessment are very
likely at risk in terms of their reading mastery. Special attention should
be paid to examining the performance of these students on the Fluency
Assessment and the Dictation Identification Assessment that are to be
administered during the next several lessons.

~~**MEET AS A GRADE LEVEL**~~


This point in the school year would be an excellent time to meet as a grade
level and examine student progress. After completing and analyzing all
assessments, it is strongly recommended that you meet with your fellow
grade-level teachers to look globally at student progress and consider any
adjustments that may need to be made to groups across the grade level.


~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


For the next three days, lessons will include a combination of assessment
and review activities. You should divide your class into thirds and administer
the Fluency Assessment as a one-on-one assessment to approximately onethird of your students each day.


Administer the Dictation Identification Assessment to the entire class on
Day 2.


Select pages and activities from the Pausing Point for groups and/or
individual students to complete on all three days. Further direction on
determining specific Pausing Point activity pages is included at the end of
this lesson.


The following lesson plan is one way you might organize and structure the
assessments and Pausing Point activities during these lessons. For Days
1 and 3, you may use the template as written. For Day 2, administer the
Dictation Identification Assessment first as a whole group activity.

  - Ask each student to come to the table with their Activity Book.


  - Tear Activity Pages 23.1–23.4 from the Activity Book.


  - Write the student’s name at the top of each page.


  - Use Activity Page 23.2 to mark as a running record as you listen to the student
read aloud. Place Activity Page 23.1 in front of the student. Give the following
directions:

    - “The title of this story is ‘The Visit.’ Have you ever gone to visit someone or
someplace?”


    - Allow the student a few moments to respond to your prompt. Then tell the
student, “Today you will read a story aloud to me about a visit that Kim and
Kurt make to see their mom.”


    - “In just a minute, I am going to ask you to read the story. I want you to
think about the story as you read because I will ask you some questions

  - When the student completes the story, record the amount of time the
student took to read the passage.


  - Ask the student the questions on Activity Page 23.3. Students should have
Activity Page 23.1 in front of them as you ask the questions and should
be encouraged to look back in the story for the answers to the questions.
Record the score at the bottom of Activity Page 23.3.


  - Then mark the Multidimensional Fluency Scale on Activity Page 23.4 at this
time as you may not recall it after assessing multiple students. The student
may return to his or her seat and you will move on to the next student. Do
not take the time to do your calculations now. Complete Words Correct Per
Minute calculations on Activity Page 23.3 later today. It is more important to
assess at least one-third of your students each day than to take up valuable
assessment time completing calculations.


Activity Pages 23.2–23.4: Fluency Assessment


Review Activity Pages 23.2–23.4 for each student and record the results on the

Fluency Assessment Record Sheet in Teacher Resources.


**Guidelines for Calculating W.C.P.M. Scores**

  - If the reading was fairly accurate (< 10 uncorrected errors), you can get a
rough (and easy) estimate of a student’s W.C.P.M. score simply by noting the
time and looking at the chart on the bottom of Activity Page 23.3


  - To calculate a student’s exact W.C.P.M. score, use the information you wrote
on the record sheet and follow the described steps. The steps are also shown
in graphic form on Activity Page 23.3 (W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet). You will
probably find it helpful to have a calculator available.


    - First, complete the Words section of the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


    - Count Words Read. This is the total number of words that the student read
or attempted to read, up to the point where he or she stopped. It includes
words that the student read correctly as well as words that the student
read incorrectly or skipped over. If the student attempted to read the
whole story, including the title, use 301 words as your total. If the student
did not finish the story, you will need to count the number of words that
the student actually attempted to read. Write the count for Words Read in
the matching box on the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.

|18|10th|



**282**




  - Count the Uncorrected Mistakes noted in your running record. This includes
words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and words that you had to
supply. Write the total in the box labeled Uncorrected Mistakes. (A mistake
that is corrected by the student is not counted as a mistake; the student is
penalized for the time he or she lost making the correction, but not for the
initial mistake.) Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get
Words Correct.


  - Next, complete the Time section of the Activity Page.


  - Calculate Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a stopwatch,
this should already be done for you. Skip to the next step.) If you used a
watch and recorded start and stop times, you will need to subtract the
Start Time from the Finish Time to calculate the Elapsed Time. Subtract
seconds from seconds then minutes from minutes. Calculate Time in
Seconds. Multiply the number of minutes by 60 to convert minutes to
seconds, and then add the number of seconds.


  - Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then multiply by 60 to get
Words Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.).


- As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider:


  - It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.
scores. However, a major goal for Grade 2 students is to read with
sufficient fluency to ensure comprehension and independent reading of
school assignments in subsequent grades. Exact fluency targets vary from
state to state; the national mean calculated by Hasbrouck and Tindal in
2006 for Winter of Grade 2 is 72 W.C.P.M.


  - A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared with the score of other
students in the classroom (or grade level) and also with the national
fluency norms for Winter of Grade 2 obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal.
Students whose scores are below the 25th percentile (42 W.C.P.M), are
experiencing serious problems in reading fluently.


- Compare the student’s W.C.P.M. score to national norms for Winter of Grade
2 (Hasbrouck and Tindal, 2006):


Foundational Skills 4


  - After you have entered each student’s scores on Activity Page 23.3 (W.C.P.M
Calculation Sheet), record them on the Fluency Assessment Record Sheet
found in Teacher Resources.


**Analysis**

  - Students who answered 3 or more questions correctly are reading with
understanding.


  - Students who receive a fluency rating of Mostly Fluent or Fluent on the
Multidimensional Fluency Scale are making good to excellent progress in
terms of reading fluency.


  - Students who receive a fluency rating of Improving may benefit from
particular attention devoted to preteaching words that include tricky
spellings and multisyllable words prior to the independent reading of any
new story. These students will also benefit from additional opportunities to
re-read stories multiple times.


  - Students who receive a fluency rating of Labored are clearly struggling
and are likely at risk in terms of their reading mastery. Their results on
this assessment should be examined in conjunction with the Reading
Comprehension Assessment and the Word Identification and Decoding
Skills Assessment, with a view to providing intensive remediation.

**Primary Focus:** Students will hear dictated words and select the correct word
from a list of similarly spelled words and will circle words that share the same
vowel sounds as dictated words. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.i**~~


~~**WORD RECOGNITION ASSESSMENT (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 23.5.


  - Tell students you will read a word from each row and they should circle the
word you read. Be sure to call out each row by number to orient students.
Read the word only twice. Do not read the word more than twice as both
accuracy and automaticity are being evaluated.


  - Here are the words for the front side of Activity Page 23.5:

Appendix: Using
Chunking to Decode
Multisyllable Words


Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences will enable students to read one-syllable
words with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences is no guarantee
that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllable words. To this end, most
students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk, and read parts of
words—syllables—as a way to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can then
be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated and students are expected
to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, this program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the easiest
two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is already a
familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In addition, each
syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing_, _hunt·er_, _bust·ed_ ). The
dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain double-letter
spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed after the double-letter spelling rather than
between the two consonants (e.g., _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers familiar with other ways to
chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is done, however, because the double-letter
spellings have been taught as single-spelling units since Kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’

 - /t/, etc.). This program strives to be consistent in representing these spellings in the way that
students have been taught to process them (e.g., as whole entities for a sound). (Ultimately, as
students become more proficient at decoding and chunking syllables through subsequent grade
levels, it really does not matter whether they visually chunk and decode these words as _batt·ed_ or
_bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding these two-syllable words consisting of root
words and suffixes relatively easy.


Foundational Skills 4


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable words.
To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


  - **Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound**
**(e.g., /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/):** _let,_ _pad,_ _rod,_ _tin,_ _fun,_ _pic·nic,_ _un·til_


  - **Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C-E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/,**
**/ie/, /oe/, /ue/):** _cake,_ _home,_ _like,_ _mule,_ _Pete, mis·take, stam·pede_


  - **Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint,_ _speak,_ _proud,_ _play, dis·may, be·low,_ _coun·sel_


  - **R-Controlled Syllables:** _art,_ _curb,_ _girl,_ _fort,_ _clerk,_ _tur·nip, ar·tist, fe·ver_


  - **Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /ie/,**
**/oe/, /ue/):** _go,_ _me,_ _hi,_ _a·pron, f·nal, com·pre·hend_


  - **Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple, puz·zle, raf·fe, ca·ble, ri·fe_


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


  - **Schwa Syllables:** _ben·e·fit, ap·pe·tite, a·bout, hos·pit·al,_ _e·mo·tion_


**Note:** The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately because
of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


**To be clear, in order to decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these**
**names. The names of the syllable types are provided here only to establish a common**
**vocabulary for teachers as they use the materials.** What is necessary, however, for students to
become fluent readers of longer words in increasingly complex text, is that they be able to visually
parse certain spelling patterns as syllable chunks so they can quickly and easily decode each
syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed-syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in Kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


  - When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.


_ad · mit_ _nap · kin_ _trum · pet_


Appendix
**413**


**414**




 - For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed after the
double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is done because the
double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units since Kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’

  - /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).


_traff · ic_ _muff · in_ _happ · en_


 - When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.


_mon · ster_ _con · tract_ _pil · grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read
the first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model
for students how to blend the two syllables aloud:


In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the magic
‘E’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


 - Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for closed
syllables:


_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


In Grade 2, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to use
a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying each
possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


Foundational Skills 4


  - When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:


_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_


However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There is
no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be flexible
and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to determine
whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. In order to recognize
whether a word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has
heard before (i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent
an additional challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a
second language.


  - If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:


_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is fairly straightforward.


Appendix
**415**


**416**




 - When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings in
the words


_ban · gle_ _twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_


In the latter part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings represent
the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a combination of stressed
and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed or weakly stressed, its
vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that linguists call a schwa.
This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’ and
‘tion’. Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite challenging for many
students.


 - Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the
schwa sound has a particular spelling:


_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is actually a schwa syllable, but it is identified
separately because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


 - Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables accordingly
throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _tri·cycle_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness_ _help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten–Grade 3,
with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.
