**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 4. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. The activity pages in this book
do not include written instructions for students because the instructions would have words that
are not decodable. Teachers will explain these activity pages to the students orally, using the
instructions in the Teacher Guide. The Activity Book is a student component, which means each
student should have an Activity Book.

**Dear Family Member,**


We will start a new unit this week. The Reader for this unit is _The Job Hunt_ . In this book,
Kim, a college student, hunts for a job. Her younger brother, Kurt, follows along as she goes
from place to place in her search. Kim and Kurt will visit many places in New York City as
they ride the subway and walk to each location.


Please continue to try to find time to read with your student daily. We encourage you
to take advantage of the public library so your student can select books of interest. The
librarian should be able to direct you to books appropriate for most second graders. It is
fine for your student to occasionally choose books that may be too hard for her or him
to read independently. For example, if your student is interested in horses, he or she may
select a book with many interesting photographs of horses, but it may be too difficult to
read alone. Encourage your student to talk to you about the illustrations and to try to read
whatever he or she can, while you assist with more difficult words.


The following are the spelling words for this week. We have already learned how to read
words with these sounds in other lessons earlier this year. For example, your student has
learned the /aw/ sound may be spelled either ‘aw’ or ‘au’, the /oi/ sound may be spelled
either as ‘oi’ or ‘oy’, and the /oo/ sound, as in _moon_, can be spelled several different ways.


Remember when you practice with your student during the week, call out the words in
random order to make sure he or she has really learned each word.


hawk vault oil cowboy moon


yawn haunted spoiled enjoy spool

**Brooklyn**


Kim took Kurt by the hand and the two of them
set off so that Kim could look for a job.

It was a summer morning in Brooklyn. There were
lots of cars on the streets. There were people walking
here and there. A man was sweeping the street outside
his shop.

Kim and Kurt walked until they got to Prospect
Park.

Kurt looked into the park as they went past. He
saw people playing frisbee. He saw people on bikes.
He saw a man playing fetch with his dog. He saw
soccer players on their way to a game. He saw runners
on their way to the gym.

“Can we stop and play?” asked Kurt.

“No,” Kim said. “I have to get a job.”

Kurt slumped a bit to let Kim see that he was sad,
but he kept walking.

“Kim,” he said after a bit, “will having a job make
you a grownup?”

“Well, sort of,” said Kim. “I’m in college. I think
that makes me part kid and part grownup.”

“Will you still have time to play with me?”

“Yes!” Kim said, rubbing Kurt’s arm. “We will
have lots of time to play. I’ll get a part-time job, one
that is not too hard. That way, I will not be too tired
when I get home. Then we can play.”

“You should get a job at the Bronx Zoo!” Kurt said. “Then you can play
with the snakes and tigers.”

Kim said. “I don’t think so. I don’t like snakes. But we can visit the zoo
later this summer. After I get a job, I will have cash to do fun things like
that.”

Just then Kim saw two old pals waving at her.

“Lynn!” she yelled. “Sheryl! What’s up?”

Lynn and Sheryl crossed the street. “Hi, Kim!” said Lynn. “Are you
home from college for the summer?”

“Yes,” said Kim. “It’s good to be back here in Brooklyn!”

Kim slapped hands with her pals. Then she said, “You two have met
Kurt, haven’t you?”

Lynn and Sheryl nodded. Lynn stooped down to look at Kurt and
said, “Hi, big man! Would you like to come with us? We are going over to
Drummer’s Grove to see the drummers.”

“Drummer’s Grove?” Kurt said. “Can
we go, Kim? Can we? Can we? Can we?”

Kim hesitated. She needed to get
started on her job hunt. But she wanted
Kurt to have fun, too. If she dragged him
off without seeing the drummers, there
was a chance he would get mad and fuss
all day. That would not be much fun.

“Okay,” she said at last. “But just for
a bit. I need to get started with my job
hunt.”

**Dear Family Member,**


This week all of the spelling words contain r-controlled vowels. You may also notice the
number of spelling words each week has increased. We are beginning to step up the rigor
of our program as students become more adept at reading and spelling words.


In addition to reading every night for at least 20 minutes, students should practice
spelling words.


As always, if you have questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.

**The Gym**


After leaving Dwight’s Lights, Kim stopped for a moment to think about
where she should try next to find a job.

“Mom’s pals, Tom and Beth, run a gym that is nearby. I might have a chance
getting a job at their gym, so let’s go!”

On the way to the gym, Kim explained to Kurt that a gym is a place where
people go to exercise and get in shape. She explained that people pay to be
members of a gym.

Kurt had never visited a gym. The gym seemed odd to him. He stood staring
at a man who was jogging in place.

“He keeps running,” said Kurt, “but he is still in the same place!”

“It’s kind of like the wheel that rat of yours likes to run on,” said Kim. “It lets
him run in place.”

“He’s not a rat,” said Kurt. “He’s a hamster!”

Kurt kept on looking at the man jogging in place.

“Why not just run in the park?” he asked.

“Some people think the gym is fun, just like you think the park is fun,” Kim
said.

“All the people here are working hard,” Kurt said. “Why do they pay to work
so hard?”

“It makes them feel good and strong after they have finished,” Kim said.

Just then Tom and Beth came over to see them.

“Hi, Kim! Hi, Kurt!” said Beth. “It’s good to see you. What brings you here?”

Kim said, “I’m looking for a summer job. I stopped to see if you need help.
Are you hiring?”


Foundational Skills 4
**53**


“We just hired someone for a job in the snack bar,” Beth said, pointing over
to the counter. “People like to have a cool drink and a snack when they finish in
the gym.”

“That looks like a good job,” said Kim. “I wish I had gotten here sooner.”

“Bad timing,” said Beth. “We don’t need more help right now. But you will
find a job somewhere else.”

Tom took Kurt and Kim to see the rest of the gym.

Kurt pointed at a man who was doing curls.

“What’s he doing?” Kurt asked.

“He’s doing curls,” Tom explained. “Would you like to do some curls?”

Kurt nodded.

“Here,” Tom said.

“Use this one. Lift it up. That will strengthen your biceps—the tops of your
arms. Then let it down. That will strengthen your triceps—the backs of your
arms.”

Kurt did five or six curls. Then he clenched his arm and yelled, “I am the
man of steel!”

Kim just smiled at Kurt.

Kim spoke to Beth and Tom. “Well, I suppose we should go,” she said.
“Thank you for meeting with me.”

“No problem,” said Tom.

“Good luck with the job hunt,” said Beth. “We will send word to you if we
need help here.”

“Why don’t you go see Alberto at the corner market?” added Tom. “He may
have a job for you. Plus, he’s one of the nicest men I ever met.”

This week’s spelling words focus on the spelling ‘ow’, which can stand for two sounds as
in _glow_ or _now_ . On the back of this letter is a variation of the “I Spy” game you may have
played with your student. It is called “I Am Thinking of a Word.” You will provide clues to
describe something about which you are thinking; your student should guess the correct
word and write it as the answer. Your student may enjoy playing this game as a different
way to practice these spelling words.


First, ask your student to read the entire list of spelling words. Then say each clue,
asking your student to think of which spelling word you are describing and write the word.

**The Subway**


When Kim and Kurt were finished eating, Kim
paid for the meal and left a tip for the waitress. Then
they went out of the diner.

“We need to get on the subway and go into
Manhattan,” she said.

“Manhattan?” Kurt said with a loud sigh. “This
job hunt will take all day!”

“It won’t take that long. I’m just having no
luck here in Brooklyn. Maybe I can find a job in
Manhattan.”

They walked to the subway stop.

Kim got out the fare card her mom had given her.

“Which train will we take?” Kurt asked.

“The Number 3 train.”

Kim pointed to a map on the wall. She showed
Kurt a red line on the map. “We will ride from here
in Brooklyn over to Manhattan and all the way up to
Times Square.”

Kurt pointed at the spot on the map that marked
the East River.

“Will we get to see the river?”

“No,” said Kim. “The subway goes under the river.
That’s why it’s named a subway. _Sub_ means under. A
subway is a train that goes under things like rivers and
roads. It travels underground.”

Kurt and Kim waited on the platform
for the subway train. Soon, Kurt could hear
the sound of the train as it got closer. There
was a gust of air. The train rolled up to the
platform and stopped.

The people inside the subway train were
packed in tight. There were no seats, so Kim
reached up and grabbed a strap. Kurt held on
tight to Kim’s leg.

The train started off with a jerk. All the
people swayed from side to side. Kurt could
hear the train squeaking and creaking.

Soon, the train slowed down. A voice
came over the speaker, “This is Clark Street.
Next stop is Wall Street.”

“Where are we?” Kurt asked Kim.

“This is the last stop in Brooklyn,” Kim
explained. “Next, the subway crosses over to
Manhattan.”

“Then can we get off? I’m so squashed
I’m having a hard time breathing.”

“Hang in there,” Kim said. “Some people
will get off as soon as we get to Manhattan.”

Kim was right. The next stop was Wall
Street. Lots of people got off the train.

At last, Kurt and Kim got seats on the
train.

“This is much better!” Kurt said.

**Wall Street**


At the Wall Street stop a man got on the
train. He had on black pants, a black jacket,
a crisp white shirt, and a red necktie. He was
holding a black case. He looked sharp.

Kurt jabbed Kim with his elbow and
whispered, “What do you think his job is?

“I don’t know,” Kim said. “He might be
a banker who has a job in a bank on Wall
Street.”

“What’s a bank?”

“A bank is a place where you can keep
your cash so it is safe. The bank keeps your
cash until you need it and they pay you a bit
for saving your cash with them. Since not
everyone needs their cash at the same time,
the bank has extra cash that they can use to
make loans to people who need cash.”

“What’s a loan?”

“When you get a loan from a bank, the
bank lets you borrow some of the cash that it
has, and you make a deal to pay the cash back
later, plus some fees that the bank adds in.”


“You mean you have to pay back more
cash than the cash you borrow?”


“That’s right.”

“Why not just use the cash you’ve got?” Kurt asked.


“Well, if you have a lot of cash, you might not need to get a loan. But
let’s say you plan to open your own store. You would need a lot of cash
before you even opened the store! You might not have all of this cash on
your own, so you might need a loan to get started.”


Kurt dreamed of a store
he might like to open and of a
banker handing him a big bag of
cash. Then he dreamed that he
might even like to be a banker
himself.


“Do bankers get paid a lot?”
Kurt asked.


“Some of them do.”


“So why don’t you get a job at
a bank?”


“Most banks won’t hire you
unless you have finished two or
three years of college. I have just
finished one year.”


“So it’s a hard job to get?”


Kim nodded.

These are noun pairs for your student to use to practice writing possessives. Your
student has been learning about both common and proper nouns, and the apostrophe–’s’
at the end of nouns meaning that the noun possesses something. We’ve been pairing
proper noun (e.g., Mike) and common nouns (e.g., book) and pairing them to form
possessive pairs (e.g., Mike’s book.) Have your student write a word from the left column
and a word from the right column and add after the word from the left to indicate
possession. Afterwards, ask your student to use the word pair in complete sentences
(e.g., Kim’s drum is loud.).

sound /ee/ (‘e_e’ as in _Pete_ ; ‘ee’ as in _creek_ ; ‘e’ as in _he_ ; ‘ea’ as in _meal_ ).


If at all possible, review the words each evening with your student. You may also suggest
your student review the words independently by asking your student to write the words
a few times every evening. You will be surprised how much your student can learn in just
10–15 minutes of practice each night.


Continue to have your student read every night. At this point in the year, your student
may be ready to begin reading silently. As students start to read silently, they often
subvocalize or “whisper read” to themselves. As your student continues to practice
reading, he or she may start just moving their lips with no sound; with more practice,
he or she will finally feel comfortable reading silently. You can suggest that your student
alternate reading a page of a story aloud to you with reading a page silently to himself/
herself to encourage the development of silent reading. However, let your student choose
whatever way he or she feels most at ease in reading.

**The Daydream**


The subway train went on past Wall
Street, going north.

Kim looked at the Job Opening ads in
the paper.

Kurt looked up at the posters that were
hanging on the walls of the train. One
of them was a poster of two star baseball
players. The players seemed to smile down at
Kurt, as if to say, “This is the life, man!”

Kurt stared at the poster and
daydreamed. He could hear a man speaking.
The man was calling out the play-by-play for
a baseball game.

_“Two out in the ninth inning,” the man_
_said. “The home team is down by two runs. So,_
_Mark, it looks like it’s all up to Kurt Gunter at_
_this point.”_

_“Well, James,” said a different voice, “Kurt_
_Gunter has had such a good year. As you know,_
_the former spaceship pilot and race car driver is_
_leading the team in hits, home runs, and runs_
_batted in. He has hit the ball so well this year_
_that most fans I’ve spoken with think he’s the_
_bee’s knees! In fact, I had a caller on my show,_
_Sports Yap, last week who told me he thinks_
_Gunter should make twice what they pay him.”_

_“So Gunter steps up to the plate. Here’s the pitch. It’s a strike. The fans are_
_mad. They don’t like the call. They think it was a ball. But Gunter himself_
_seems not to mind. He steps back into the box. Here’s the pitch. Gunter swings.”_

_Smack!_

_“Look out, Mark! He got a bit of that one! It’s a long fly ball to the left. It’s_
_going, it’s going. It’s out of here! Kurt Gunter has hit a home run! Home run by_
_Gunter! We win! We win!”_

_“James, I’m telling you, that’s why Kurt Gunter is a rich man!”_

_“Gunter is rounding the bases. He tips his hat to the fans. The fans are going_
_wild! They are shouting, ‘Kurt! Kurt! Kurt!’”_

Just then Kurt looked up. Kim was shaking him and saying, “Kurt,
Kurt, Kurt! This is our stop!”

side of the street. “Where to?” asked the driver. Kim told him the address.

They made it safely. Kim paid the driver. She and Kurt went in to see their
mom. Mrs. Gunter gave Kim a big hug. Kurt snuck in between them so he
could be part of the hug, too. Then Kim told her mom how they had spent
the day. She told her mom how she had used math to help her get the job at
the grocery. By the end of the story, Mrs. Gunter was beaming. “You see,” she
said. “I told you math would help you out one day.”

“I never dreamed I would have a job in a grocery,” added Kim, “but I
think it’s going to be a good job for me.”

“It may not be the job of your dreams,” said her mom. “But it’s a job. If
you study hard in college, you will have a chance to get the job of your dreams
some day. Until then, just do a good job and save as much of your paycheck as
you can.”

Mom said, “Let’s celebrate Kim’s new job by going down to Battery Park
for a picnic. Are you two hungry for dinner?”

“You bet!” said Kurt. They went to a sub shop nearby. Mrs. Gunter
ordered a sub for each of them, plus some snacks and drinks. Then Mrs.
Gunter hailed a cab. The cab took them down the West Side Highway. It
dropped them off in Battery Park.

Last Friday, Mike and his dad visited the wildlife park


in Ohio. Mike was most excited to see the tigers, but as


soon as he spied them, he became frightened. (Mike is just


five.) His dad tried to quiet him, but Mike started crying


and would not stop. He was terrified of the tigers! At last,


Mike’s dad asked Mike if he’d like to see the pythons.


Mike nodded and his sobs subsided. He was quiet as he


and his dad tried to find the pythons, but once they found


them, Mike started smiling and chatting up a storm.

This morning, my mom gave me a yellow pot filled with brown
soil. She told me that the soil had a flower seed in it. I set the pot
on my windowsill and waited, but the flower did not grow. I put
the pot in the shower to water the seed, but the flower did not
grow. I placed the pot where the sun would shine on it, but the
flower did not grow. I placed the pot in a shadow, but the flower
still did not grow. I frowned and was just about to throw it out.
At last, my mom said to me, “Don’t you know that flowers grow
slowly?” Well, now I know!

Katie and Molly and their mom took a cab from

their hotel to the beach. At the beach, all three

smeared sunblock all over their skin. It was hot

so they got in the sea for a bit. Then they looked

for seashells. After that, Katie and Molly played

volleyball with some teenagers. Katie made some

really sweet plays. (She’s quite the athlete.) In fact,

a small group formed to look at her play. After the

game, Katie and Molly and their mom started to

feel like they could use some food. They left the

beach to find something to eat. What a good day!

**The Visit**


Kim was happy that she had found herself a summer job.

“Let’s go and visit Mom,” she said. “She will be finished teaching by the
time we get there.”

Mrs. Gunter was a math teacher. She taught at a college in lower
Manhattan.

Kim held up a hand to hail a cab.

A yellow cab screeched to a stop on the side of the street. Kurt and Kim
hopped in.

“Where to?” asked the driver.

Kim told him the address.

The cab went shooting off. Wind came rushing in the windows as the cab
sped past stores on both sides.

Kurt hung on tight. It was a crazy ride. The cab man was weaving in and
out of traffic. Kurt thought they might crash. Part of him was frightened. But
part of him found driving at that speed exciting. It was like riding in a race
car.

“Do you have a license to drive?” Kurt called to the driver.

“Yes. All cab drivers must have a license,” the driver said.

“And they teach you to drive like this?”

“No, no,” said the driver. “It takes years and years of driving to become an
expert like me!”

They made it safely. Kim paid the driver and gave him a tip. She and Kurt
went in to see their mom.

Mrs. Gunter gave Kim a big hug. Kurt snuck in between them so he could
be part of the hug, too. Then Kim told her mom how they had spent the day.

Kim listed the places they had visited. She explained what had happened
with Tom and Beth, with Alberto at the corner market, with Dwight, the

Man of Light, with Hester the florist, and, at last, with Mr. Fremont. She
told her mom how she had used math to help her get the job at the grocery.

By the end of the story, Mrs. Gunter was beaming. “You see,” she said. “I
told you math would help you out one day. You thought I was crazy.”

“You were right,” said Kim. “Mr. Fremont was really impressed that I
could add up the tally without the cash register and also add in the sales tax.”

“Good for you!” said her mom. “I’m so proud of you!”

“I never dreamed I would have a job in a grocery,” added Kim, “but I
think it’s going to be a good job for me.”

“It may not be the job of your dreams,” said her mom. “But it’s a job. The
next job you get can be better. And the next one can be even better. If you
study hard in college, you will have a chance to get the job of your dreams
some day. Until then, just do a good job and save as much of your paycheck as
you can.”

“I will,” said Kim.

“Let’s do something fun!” said Kurt.

“I know!” said their mom. “Let’s celebrate Kim’s new job by getting some
subs and snacks and going down to Battery Park for a picnic. Are you two
hungry for dinner?”

“You bet!” said Kurt.

“This is crazy!” Kim said. “Mom, all day, Kurt ate and ate. Each time I got
him a snack, I said, that’s the end of that. But he was still hungry.”

“Well, he’s a strong, growing child,” said Mrs. Gunter. “And he was busy
all day.”

“That’s right!” said Kurt.

They went to a sub shop nearby. Mrs. Gunter ordered a sub for each of
them, plus some snacks and drinks.

Then Mrs. Gunter hailed a cab. The three of them got in. The cab took
them down the West Side Highway. It dropped them off in Battery Park, on
the south end of Manhattan.
