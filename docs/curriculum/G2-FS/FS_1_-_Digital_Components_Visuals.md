**Kate Visits Do·ba**


I’m Kate Nez and last summ·er, when I was nine, my mom and
dad took me to vis·it my Do·ba. Do·ba is my mom’s mom. She is an
art·ist and she has a **cab**                       - **in** out in the Southwest.


At the start of my vis·it with Do·ba, I was sad. It seemed like it
would be a dull summ·er. But in the end, I had a lot of fun.


I was sitt·ing in the kitch·en, patt·ing the cat that was sitt·ing on
my lap, when Do·ba came in.


“I just spoke with Sa·ni,” she said. “He made us an **off·er** .”


“What sort of off·er?”


“He asked if we would like to camp with him and Gad.”


“Who is Gad?”


“Gad is a kid. He’s nine, like you. Sa·ni is his grand·dad.”


“What would we do?” I asked.


“Well, we would hike, look at rocks, cook lunch and dinn·er
out·side, look at the stars, and sleep in a tent.”


“Gee,” I said, “that sounds like fun! When can we start?”


“To·morr·ow morn·ing!” Do·ba said.

**The Campsite**


Sa·ni came and picked us up in his truck. We drove for miles to
get to the **camp·site** .


“Do·ba,” I said, “what is this place?”


“Well,” said Do·ba, “take a look. See all the sand, rocks, and stones?
This land is not good for farming, but it’s good for hik·ing.”


“And it’s good land for camp·ing!” said Sa·ni.


When we got to the camp·site, we had to un·pack sleep·ing bags,
tents, lan·terns, match·es, and lots of food. We lugged it all to the
camp·site.


Sa·ni chose a spot to set up camp. Gad and I helped set up the tents.
It took us a long time.


For dinn·er we had hot dogs.
We stuck them on sticks and
held them in the fire. My hot
dog got all black be·cause I left it
in there too long. Gad gave me
one of his.


That was when I said to
my·self, “Gad is O.K.!”

**The Hike**


The next morn·ing, we went on a hike. Af·ter a bit, we stopped for
lunch.


When Gad fin·ished his lunch, he asked, “Can Kate and I look for
rocks by our·selves?”


Sa·ni said O.K.


“Kate,” Gad said to me, “bring your fork. We can use it to dig up
rocks.”


I grabbed my fork and we went off to look for rocks.


Gad point·ed at a bump
on the side of a **cliff** and said,
“Let’s dig that rock out!”


The rock did not look all
that large. But when we start·ed
digg·ing, we soon saw that it was
larg·er than it had seemed.


Af·ter a bit, Gad said, “Gee!
It must be two feet long! We’ve
got to keep scratch·ing.”


We went on scratch·ing with
our forks.



“Let’s tug on it!” Gad said.


We grabbed it and gave a big tug.


It popped out. But so did a big cloud of sand and dust. Gad and I
fell down.


Once the dust and sand had drift·ed off, I saw Gad stand·ing there
with the thing in his hands.


“It’s not a rock!” he yelled. “It’s a **bone** !”


It was the bigg·est bone I had ev·er seen. It was three feet long!


Sa·ni and Do·ba came runn·ing. When she saw the bone, Do·ba
looked up·set.


“Are you OK?” I asked.


She did not say. “Will you tell me, Kate, where you found that
large bone?”


I point·ed to the spot where we found it.


“Good·ness!” she said. “It was in the cliff.”


“What is done is done,” said Sa·ni. “Let’s look at it.”


Sa·ni set the bone on the ground. Then he took a pic·ture of the
bone and said, “We need to get an **ex·pert** to look at this bone and
tell us what sort of bone it is.”

**Lesson 4: Activity Page 4.1** **Digital Component 4.1**



**The Bone Man**


The next morn·ing, Sa·ni said, “I just had a chat with a man from
West·ern State **Coll·ege** . His name is Ron Fitch and he is an ex·pert
on bones. He has writt·en lots of books. If we bring him the bone, he
can tell us what sort of bone it is.”


We got in·to the truck. Sa·ni
said that I was in charge of the
bone. I wrapped it up and set it
on my lap.


When we got to the
coll·ege, we gave the bone man
the bone. When he saw it, he
broke in·to a big grin.


The bone man bent down
and said, “I could be wrong,
but it looks like you’ve found
some·thing big here! I have to

a bone of a **rap** - **tor** .”


“What’s a rap·tor?” I asked.


“Kate!” Gad said, “A rap·tor
is like the cool·est **rep·tile** of
all time!”



The next week, Do·ba said, “I just spoke with Ron Fitch, the bone
man. I’ve got three things to tell you. Two of them are good things
that you will like. One is a bad thing that you will not like.”


“Tell me one of the good things,” I said.


“Mis·ter Fitch got the tests back. The bone that you and Gad
found is a rap·tor bone!”


“Yipp·ee!” I shout·ed. “I am glad that is solved. Gad will be so
thrilled that he has a rap·tor bone!”


“Well,” said Do·ba, “that brings me to the bad thing.”


“The next thing is there is a law that says that you can’t dig up
bones and keep them for your·self,” Do·ba said. “We Na·va·jo say the
bone should have stayed in the ground. It be·longs to no one. But now
that it is out, Mis·ter Fitch and his hel·pers will keep it safe for us.”


“May I tell you the second good thing? They would like you
and Gad to vis·it them when they are digg·ing up the bones. And
they would like the two of you to pick out a name for the rap·tor that
you found.”


“So cool!” I said.

**The Big Dig**


When we went back to the cliff, the bone man was there with
some help·ers. They had **scraped** the side of the cliff to ex·pose a lot
of the rap·tor.


“So, will you dig out all of the bones here on **site** ?” asked Do·ba.


“No,” said the bone man. “The next step will be to cut this cliff
up in·to large blocks of rock. Then we will wrap the blocks up in
**plast·er** . The plast·er will keep the bones from crack·ing. Then we
will use a large **crane** to set the blocks on trucks. Then the trucks will
take them to my **lab** . Once the blocks are there, we will start digg·ing
the bones out of the blocks.”


“What sort of tools do
you use for that?” asked
Do·ba.


“We use tools a lot like
the ones den·tists use on
teeth—brush·es and sharp
picks.”


“Kate and I used forks!”
said Gad.


“How long will it take
to get all of the bones out of
the rocks?” Sa·ni asked.



“Well,” said the bone man. “We’ve got a lot to do. It will take
some time be·cau se we have to be care·ful not to wreck the bones.”


“Will you be fin·ished by the end of the summ·er?” I asked.


“No,” said the bone man. “You and Gad will have to vis·it next
summ·er and per·haps the summ·er af·ter that. Then we can catch up
on our digg·ing prog·ress!”


“So,” said the bone man, “have you kids picked out a name for
this rap·tor?”


“Yes, I’ve picked one,” I said.


All of the digg·ers stopped digg·ing and looked at me.


I said, “This rap·tor will be named Gad!”


All of the men cheered.


Gad and Kate smiled with pride.
