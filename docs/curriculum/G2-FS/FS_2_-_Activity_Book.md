**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 2. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. The activity pages in this book
do not include written instructions for students because the instructions would have words that
are not decodable. Teachers will explain these activity pages to the students orally, using the
instructions in the Teacher Guide. The Activity Book is a student component, which means each
student should have an Activity Book.

We have started a new Reader called _Bedtime Tales_ . It is an ongoing story of a little
boy named Mike who doesn’t want to go to bed at bedtime. Does this sound familiar to
you? Mike is persuaded to go to bed by his dad telling him bedtime stories. We hope your
student will enjoy this series of stories, and that you will also take the opportunity to tell
some bedtime tales to your student. Telling and reading stories at bedtime are valuable
ways to improve your student’s vocabulary and future school success.


The spelling words for this week are below. As always, please practice these words with
your student each night. Read the words aloud and ask your student to write them down.
Alternatively, you could ask your student to copy each word three times.

Your student read this story in class earlier this week. Please ask your student to read
the story aloud to you and then discuss with your student what Jane learned.

**The Milk**


Mike’s dad was getting set to tell a
bedtime tale. He said, “The name of
this bedtime tale is ‘The Milk’ _._ ”


Once upon a time, a lass named
Jane set off from home to sell a bucket
of milk.


As she went, she was thinking of
the cash she would get from selling the
milk.


“I have big plans. I will sell this
milk,” she said, “and I will use the cash
to get a hen. I hope my hen will make
lots of eggs.”


“Then I will sell those eggs and use
the cash to get a cute piglet. I will take
care of the piglet and let him munch on
pig slop till he gets nice and plump.”

**22**



“Then I will sell the pig and get a
nice dress that I can dance in, and . . .”


But just as she was thinking of
the dress, she tripped on a stone and
the bucket fell with a crash. The milk
splashed on the path. Jane made a face
and fumed at the spilt milk.

**Moral: Take one step at a**
**time.**

“Is that the end?” asked Mike.


“That’s it,” said his dad.


“What a shame!” said Mike. “She had such big plans!”


Mike’s dad nodded. “You can make plans, but planning by itself
will not make things happen.”


Mike sat thinking a bit. Then he said, “Dad, that bedtime tale was
not bad. But it was sad. Next time would you tell a fun tale?”


“Yes,” said his dad.
“Next time.”

This is the first part of a trickster tale that we are reading in class. Please ask your
student to read it aloud to you. After reading the story, have your student draw a picture
about the story and write a sentence about the picture on the next page.

**The Jumping Frog**


“Dad,” Mike said, “you said we could have a fun bedtime tale this
time. Have you got one that’s fun?”


“Yes,” said his dad. “I’ve got one I think you will like. It’s a tale my
dad used to like to tell. It takes place in the West a long time back in
the past. The name of the tale is ‘The Jumping Frog’.”


Once there was a man named Big Jim who had a frog.


Big Jim held the frog up and made a speech. “This is the best
jumping frog in the land!” he said. “This frog has speed. It can jump
three feet at once. You think your frog can jump? I’ll bet he can’t
jump like my frog! In fact, I got ten bucks says there’s not a frog in
the land can jump as fast as this frog. This frog hops like the wind.
This frog . . .”


Well, Big Jim would have
kept on bragging, but, just
then, a man in a black vest
got up and spoke.


“My name is Pete. I’m
not from here,” said the man.
“And I do not have a frog.


Foundational Skills 2



**27**


But if I did, I would take the bet
and race your frog.”


“Well, shucks,” said Big Jim.
“That’s not a problem. Here, take
my frog. I’ll run down to the
stream and catch you a frog so we
each have a frog to compete in the
race.” Big Jim handed his frog to
Pete. Then he ran off to the stream.


Mike’s dad was not finished
telling the tale, but Mike had
drifted off to sleep. He gave Mike a
kiss and hoped he would have
sweet dreams.

This week during our language arts time, we will begin to explore the writing process
with students. Students will learn to plan, draft, and edit their work before creating a
final product. We will not “publish” each piece of writing that we create. From time to
time, we will select pieces to publish. In the meantime, you will see writing coming home
in backpacks. Ask your student to explain the process to you. At home, you can help by
suggesting your student write simple notes for you.


The spelling words for this week are below. As always, please practice these words with
your student each night. Please note that for these words, the final ‘e’ is dropped and
replaced with _–ing_ .

|Root Word|Suffix|Spelling Word|

This is the second part of a trickster tale that we are reading in class. In the first part, Big
Jim wagers that he has the fastest frog in the West. A stranger named Pete shows up to
accept the wager. Below you will find the conclusion of the story. Please ask your student
to read it aloud to you.

**The Frog Race**


“Dad,” Mike said when he woke up, “what happened with the
jumping frog? I missed the end of the tale. I was sleeping.”


“I did not tell it to the end,” said his dad. “When you drifted off
to sleep, I stopped.”


“Oh, tell the ending!” said Mike.


Mike’s dad picked up the tale where he had left off.


Big Jim handed his frog to Pete and ran off to the stream.


Pete held Big Jim’s frog in his hand. Pete looked at the frog. Then
Pete reached into his pocket and got a pile of limes. Yum—Big Jim’s
frog drooled. The frog ate the whole pile of limes from Pete’s hand!
Then Pete set the frog down.


While Pete was feeding the frog limes, Big Jim was down at the
stream. He tossed off his boots and went frog hunting. At last he
nabbed a nice green frog. He ran back and handed the frog to Pete.


“There’s your frog!” said Jim. “Just set him down there next to my
frog. Then we will let them compete to see which one of them is
the fastest!”

Pete set his frog down.


“All set?” said Jim.


“All set,” said the man.


Then Jim yelled, “Jump,
frogs, jump!”


Pete gave the two frogs a tap to get
them jumping. His frog hopped off nice
and quick. But Jim’s frog just sat there.
Once he hitched up his legs like he was
fixing to jump. But it was no use. With
all those limes in him, he was planted
there just as solid as a rock. His tummy was full!


Pete’s frog hopped and hopped till it got to the finish line.


“Fine race!” said Pete. He took Jim’s ten bucks and slipped the
cash in his pocket. Then Pete tipped his hat and set off.


Well, Big Jim was stunned. “What happened to my frog?” he said.
“I hope he’s not sick.”


He bent down and picked up the frog and rubbed his tummy.


“Goodness!” said Jim. “He must have had a big lunch!”


“I think Pete tricked me! He fed my frog too much to eat!” Jim
said. Big Jim let out a whoop. His face got red. Jim ran to catch Pete.
But it was no use. Pete had run off. Pete had tricked Big Jim!

These are our spelling words for this week. The spelling words on which your student
will be tested are the contractions listed in the second column, plus the one Tricky Word.
When practicing spelling contractions this week with your student, please also review the
two words that form the contraction. For example, one way to practice would be to say two
words, (e.g., _it is)_, and then ask your student to write the contraction (e.g., _it’s)_ .


Your student is also bringing home a story to read, “How the Hedgehog Tricked
the Hare,” and an accompanying activity page. We have been discussing in class the
characters, setting, and plot for each story. After reading the story, your student should
complete the activity page and identify the characters, setting, and plot. You can
encourage your student to look back at the story to find the answers. **Your student will**
**use this completed activity page to write a book report about the story during the**
**next class, so please make sure your student completes and brings Activity Page**
**11.5 back to school.**


You may want to preview the subheadings Title, Characters, Setting, Plot, Middle,
and End.

**How the Hedgehog Tricked the Hare**



“Where was it I left off?” asked Mike’s dad.


“The hedgehog was telling his wife the plan to trick the hare,” said Mike.


“Got it!” said his dad.


The hedgehog made a map of his plan. He pointed to the map and outlined his
plan to trick the hare.


“The hare and I will race from down by the fence up to the house on the hill,”
the hedgehog said to his wife. “I need you to stand next to the house. Stand in a
spot where the hare can’t see you. And be on the lookout, my dear!”


The hedgehog’s wife nodded and said, “Your map is clear. I will be there.”


The hedgehog went on, “When the hare gets close, you must pop out and
shout, ‘There you are! What took you so long?’ But when you do this, make your
voice deep and stern like my voice. The hare can’t tell one hedgehog from the next.
If you sound like me, he will think you are me. And he will think that he has lost
the race!”


“What a clever plan!” said his wife. “It’s perfect!”


She puckered up and kissed him on one of his cheeks, where he had no spikes.
The hedgehog handed his wife the map.


After his meal, the hedgehog went to the fence. His wife went up to the house
on the hill.


The hedgehog and the hare lined up.


“All set?” said the hare.


“All set,” said the hedgehog.

“Run!” said the hare.


The hare bounded off. He was a fast and powerful runner. In a flash he ran
down the hill, past the well, and up to the house.


When he got to the top of the hill, there was a hedgehog standing next to
the house.


It was the hedgehog’s wife, but she spoke in a deep, stern voice like a male
hedgehog. “There you are!” she said. “What took you so long?”


The hare was stunned. “It can’t be!” he said. “How did you get here so fast? I
will race you back to the fence!”


And so the hare ran back past the well and up the hill until he got back to
the fence.


And what did he see when he got there?


A hedgehog! This time it was the male hedgehog. The hedgehog said, “There
you are! What took you so long?”


“No, no, no!” screamed the hare. The hare lost his temper. “It can’t be. It can’t
be. I am faster. I will race you back to the house! You can’t beat me!”


So the hare ran back up the hill, past the well, and up to the house.


And what did he see when he got there?


A hedgehog! This time it was the hedgehog’s wife. In a deep, stern voice, she
said, “There you are! What took you so long?”


The hare ran to the fence and back ten times. But it was the same all ten times.
At last he was so tired out that he fell on the ground next to the male hedgehog. He
could not stop huffing and puffing. He frowned and said, with a gasp, “I feel weak.
You are faster and better than me!”


The hedgehog just smiled.

Dear Family Member,



**Take-Home**
12.3



This is the first part of a trickster tale we are reading in class. Please ask your student to
read it aloud to you.

**The Pancake, Part I**


“Did you enjoy the tale of the hedgehog and the hare?” asked
Mike’s dad.


“Yes, I liked it,” said Mike. “The hedgehog came up with a
good trick.”


“The tale I’d like to tell you next has a trick in it, too.”


“Cool!” said Mike. “Is there a hedgehog in it?”


“Nope,” said his dad. “But there is a pancake in it!”


“A pancake?”


“Yep.”


“Neat! Tell it!”


“But the sun has not set yet! The street lamp is not on yet!”


“Please! I would like to hear it! Will you tell the pancake tale?”


Once upon a time there was a mom who had six kids. One
morning the mom was grilling a pancake for the kids. The kids
looked at the pancake. They got out their forks and started licking
their lips.


Foundational Skills 2



**81**


**82**



The pancake looked back at the kids. He was scared. He feared
the kids would eat him. When the mom was not looking, the pancake
jumped out of the pan and ran off.


The pancake ran out of the house.


“Stop, pancake!” shouted the mom from the porch.


“Stop, pancake!” shouted the six kids.


All seven of them chased the pancake as he ran out of the yard.


But the pancake was too fast. He outran them all.


The pancake ran north on a foot path. He zoomed past a barn and
two farmers who were plowing the ground.


“Why are you running, pancake?” the farmers asked.


The pancake shouted, “I’ve outrun a mom and six kids, and I can
outrun you too! I’m too fast and too smart for you.”


“You think so?” said the farmers. They started running. But the
pancake was too fast. He outran the farmers.


Just then Mike’s sister Ann came in. She was just three. She had
on her gown for bed.


“Dad,” she said, “will you tell it to me, too?”


“Yes, I will,” said her dad. “You can sit up here with Mike and
hear the rest of the tale.”

“Let’s see,” said Mike’s dad. “Where did I stop?”


“The pancake was running,” said Mike. “He had just outrun the
two farmers.”


“OK,” said Mike’s dad. “Let’s start there.”


The pancake ran on until, by and by, he ran past a pig.


“Why are you running, pancake?” the pig asked.


The pancake shouted, “I’ve outrun a mom, six kids, and two
farmers, and I can outrun you too! I am too fast and too smart
for you.”


“You think so?” said the pig. Then it snorted and started running.
The pig chased the pancake. But the pancake was too fast.


The pancake ran on until, by and by, he ran past a hen.


“Why are you running, pancake?” the hen asked.


The pancake shouted, “I’ve outrun a mom, six kids, two farmers, and
a pig, and I can outrun you too! I am too fast and too smart for you.”


“You think so?” said the hen. Then she set off, clucking as she ran.
The hen chased the pancake. But the pancake was too fast.


The pancake went on until, by and by, he ran past a fox.


“Why are you running, pancake?” the fox asked.

The pancake said, “I’ve outrun a mom, six kids, two farmers, a
pig, and a hen, and I can outrun you too! I am too fast and too smart
for you!”


The fox did not get up. He just sat there and said, “What was that
you said? I could not quite make it out.”


The pancake stopped running and yelled, **“I’ve outrun a mom,**
**six kids, two farmers, a pig, and a hen, and I can outrun you too!**
**I am too fast and too smart for you!”**


The fox squinted and said, “What was that you said? I still could
not quite hear you. Why do you stand so far off? Stand nearer to me
so I can hear you.”


The pancake ran up near to the fox. Then he shouted at the
top of his lungs: **“I’VE OUTRUN A MOM, SIX KIDS, TWO**
**FARMERS, A PIG, AND A HEN, AND I CAN OUTRUN YOU**
**TOO! I AM TOO FAST AND TOO SMART FOR YOU!”**


“You think so?” said the fox. “I think you made a mistake and got
a bit too close.” Then he scooped the pancake into his mouth and ate
it for dinner.


And that was the end of the pancake. And that is the end of the tale.

**The Fox and the Cat**


Once a fox and a cat were drinking from a river.


The fox started bragging.



**Assessment**

“I am a clever one,” said the fox. “There are lots of beasts out there that

would like to eat me, but they can’t catch me. I have lots of tricks that help

me escape from them. I can run. I can swim. I can dig a hole and hide. Why,

I must have a hundred clever tricks!”


“I have just one trick,” said the cat. “But it is a good one.”


“Just one?” said the fox. “That’s all? Well, that is too bad for you!”


Just then there was a loud sound. It was the sound of barking dogs. A

hunter was leading a pack of hunting dogs by the side of the river.


The cat scampered up a tree and hid in the leaves.


“This is my plan,” said the cat. “What are you going to do?”


The fox started thinking which of his tricks he should use. Should he

run? Should he swim? Should he dig a hole and hide? He had such a long list

of tricks. It was hard to pick just one. But while he was thinking, the hunter

and his dogs were getting nearer and nearer. Soon they spotted the fox and

then it was too late.


The cat said, “It’s better to have one trick you can count on than a

hundred you can’t.”
