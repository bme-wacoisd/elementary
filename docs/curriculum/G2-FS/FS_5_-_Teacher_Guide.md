**Grade 2 Foundational Skills 5|**
Introduction


~~**UNIT OVERVIEW**~~


This unit is devoted to introducing spelling alternatives for vowel sounds. Vowel sounds and their
spellings are the most challenging part of the English writing system. There are only two vowel
sounds that are almost always spelled just one way (/a/ and /ar/). The other sixteen vowel sounds
have at least one significant spelling alternative. Several of them have many spelling alternatives.


The sounds and spellings taught in this unit are:


  - /u/ spelled ‘u’ ( _but_ ), ‘o’ ( _son_ ), ‘ou’ ( _touch_ ), ‘o_e’ ( _come_ )

  - /ә/ (also called the schwa sound) spelled ‘a’ ( _about_ ), ‘e’ ( _debate_ )


In addition to the above sounds and spellings, two sound combinations and their spellings are also
taught in this unit. They are:


  - /ә/ + /l/ spelled ‘al’ ( _animal_ ), ‘il’ ( _pencil_ ), ‘el’ ( _travel_ ), ‘le’ ( _apple_ )

  - /sh/ + /ә/ + /n/ spelled ‘tion’ ( _action_ )


The basic unit of instruction in this program is the phoneme. Students are taught to segment a
spoken word into single phonemes and spell the word one phoneme at a time. Likewise, when
reading, students learn to identify graphemes (or spellings) that stand for single phonemes and
then blend them to make words. This is the best way to read and write most English words, because
our writing system is based on making symbols for phonemes.


However, there are some instances in which it makes sense to look at a unit larger than a single
phoneme. Two of these multisound chunks are introduced in this unit. Both contain the /ә/ sound.
The students will learn a set of spelling alternatives for /ә/ + /l/ as in _table, shovel, nostril_, and
_animal_ . These /ә/ + /l/ words offer a good example of how /ә/ complicates English spelling. The
four words above all end with the same sound combination, /ә/ + /l/, and yet they each contain a
different spelling. Students will also learn the ‘tion’ spelling for the sound combination /sh/ + /ә/ +
/n/, as in _action_ .


You will introduce the above sounds and spellings using Spelling Trees as you have in earlier
Grade 2 units. For the various spellings of /u/, you will simply add branches to the /u/ Spelling Tree
introduced in Unit 3 with a review of short vowel sounds.


Introduction
**1**


**2**



For the schwa sounds and spellings, you may choose to have three separate new Spelling Trees: one
in which the trunk is labeled /ә/ with two branches for ‘a’ and ‘e’; a second tree in which the trunk
is labeled /ә/ + /l/ with four branches for ‘al’, ‘el’, ‘il’, and ‘le’; and a third tree in which the trunk
is labeled /sh/ + /ә/ + /n/ with one branch for ‘tion’. If space does not permit you to have three
separate trees, however, you may choose to make one large tree in which the trunk is labeled / ə /
with seven branches representing the various spellings associated with the schwa sound.


Please refer to the section More About Schwa (/ә/) in the Appendix for a more in-depth explanation
of /ә/ and its relationship to /u/.


**Tricky Spellings**


Some of the spellings introduced in this unit are “shared” between multiple sounds. For example, the
spelling ‘a’ is introduced as a spelling alternative for the /ә/ sound. However, students have already
been taught that ‘a’ is the basic code spelling for the /a/ sound, a spelling alternative for the /ae/
sound, and a spelling alternative for the /aw/ sound. We can say this spelling is shared between
/a/, /ae/, /aw/, and /ә/. Or we can say it is ambiguous because it can stand for either /a/, /ae/,
/ aw/, or /ә/. Because this spelling can stand for more than one sound, it is called a _tricky spelling_ .
Tricky spellings pose a problem for the reader. When a reader comes across an unfamiliar word
containing the ‘a’ spelling, he or she may need to try pronouncing the tricky spelling different ways
to determine the actual pronunciation of the word.


The following tricky spellings are taught in this unit:


 - ‘a’ can be pronounced /a/ ( _hat_ ), /ae/ ( _paper_ ), /ә/ ( _about_ ), or /aw/ ( _wall_ )

 - ‘e’ can be pronounced /e/ ( _pet_ ), /ee/ ( _me_ ), or /ә/ ( _debate_ )


 - ‘o’ can be pronounced /o/ ( _hop_ ), /oe/ ( _open_ ), or /u/ ( _son_ )


 - ‘o_e’ can be pronounced /oe/ ( _home_ ) or /u/ ( _come_ )


 - ‘ou’ can be pronounced /ou/ ( _shout_ ) or /u/ ( _touch_ )


**Challenges for Reading and Writing**


The sound spellings introduced in this unit will likely pose challenges for many students in your class.
The / ə / poses problems for reading. Many spellings may be pronounced as /ә/ in addition to their other
pronunciations. Once /ә/ is introduced, for example, students have to consider four pronunciations for
the tricky spelling ‘a’: /a/ as in _cat_, /ae/ as in _table_, /ә/ as in _about_, and /aw/ as in _wall._


The /ә/ poses even more serious problems for spelling. Indeed it is probably the single largest
source of difficulty in accurately spelling English words. If students spell phonemically and are not
aware of /ә/, they are likely to produce spellings like these:


 - _about_  - _ubout_


 - _America_  - _Umericu_


Foundational Skills 5


  - _benefit_   - _benufit_ or _benifit_


  - _debate_   - _dubate_ or _dibate_


You should expect to see many words spelled in this way for a while. Although not entirely correct,
these spelling choices demonstrate that the student is hearing the sounds and writing a plausible
spelling for each sound. Gradually, as students gain more exposure to printed words, they will begin
to spell more of these words correctly. This unit primarily focuses on making students aware of the
problem, encourage them to notice /ә/ while reading, consider it as another pronouncing option,
and practice spelling a few high-frequency words containing /ә/. It will take quite a bit of reading
and spelling practice for most students to begin to offer reliably correct spellings for the thousands
of English words containing /ә/. For some students, this process may take several years.


**Decodable Reader: Sir Gus**


_Sir Gus_ is a fictional Reader detailing the serendipitous undertakings of Sir Gus, one of King Alfred’s
knights. Despite his title as “Sir Gus the Fearless,” Sir Gus actually has many different fears. In this
Reader, Sir Gus has to face a thief, a troll, pirates, an evil wizard, and an enemy king.


In the Reader lessons for this unit, you will notice a decrease in the number of individual words and
spellings reviewed in isolation for decoding purposes immediately before students read the story. This
decrease is intentional and represents a very gradual process in which students will assume increasing
responsibility and independence in reading texts. While preparing for the day’s lesson, however,
you should read the story in advance, keeping in mind the letter-sound correspondence mastery of
students in your class. You should identify and select words with spellings that have been challenging
for all or particular students in the past, so these can be reviewed prior to the story. Likewise, you may
want to omit words and spellings selected for review if you feel these have been mastered.


**Reading**


With the adoption of the Texas Essential Knowledge Standards, increasing attention has been
focused on the practice of reading carefully. At the Grade 2 reading level, the focus on text-dependent
questions continues. Once again in this unit, direction is included for teachers to utilize a careful
reading approach with several stories from the Reader. These lessons have been crafted to focus the
student on the text itself and precisely what meanings can be derived from the examination of said
text.


Additionally, you will note wherever these lessons occur, the commitment to placement of decodable
text in the Reader and Activity Book does not waiver. Reading lessons will intensify as the units
progress. In Lessons 7, 14, and 16, you will find purposeful re-reading lessons. Please note, for some
weeks where writing or assessment are the focus, there may not be sufficient time available to
conduct a purposeful re-reading lesson.


Introduction

**Spelling**


Weekly spelling lists and assessments continue in this unit. The spelling lists continue to be made
up of words with letter-sound correspondences that students have already been introduced to
in reading.


In this unit, students review alphabetical order and also practice alphabetizing their spelling list
words. They are introduced to the concept of alphabetical order as an organizational principle and
are encouraged to look up their spelling words in student dictionaries if available.


At this point students have learned one way to write every sound in English except for the very
rare / zh/ as in _treasure_ . (They should also know a number of spelling alternatives for consonant
sounds.) They should therefore be able to write a plausible, if not dictionary-correct, spelling for
any word in their oral vocabulary. As the year goes on they will learn more and more of the spelling
alternatives they will need to achieve correct spelling. However, it will take some time for most
students to begin to spell with a high level of accuracy, particularly when it comes to spelling
vowel sounds.


Spelling achievement will generally trail reading achievement. First, students need to be introduced
to the spelling alternatives and learn to decode them while reading. Then, after varying amounts
of exposure to the spellings in written words, students will begin to select the correct spelling in
their own writing. Some students move fairly rapidly from seeing spelling alternatives in print and
completing word sorts to using the correct spellings in their writing. Others take much longer to
master conventional spelling. It is not unusual for this to take several years. This is not surprising
given the complicated nature of the sound/spelling correspondence system of the English language.
Nevertheless, the orderly, systematic way in which the spelling code is taught in this program should
lead to noticeable improvements in spelling ability.


While spelling mastery is progressing, you should continue to accept plausible spelling in drafts,
though you can also encourage correct spelling in revisions, particularly when the word is made up
of spellings students have been taught.


During writing activities, students will have an opportunity to practice correctly spelling highfrequency words and words with sound-spellings they have learned. Refer to the scope and
sequence as needed to determine if the sound-spelling has been previously taught, and focus on
those words in their when reviewing their writing. Many writing assignments also use an editing
checklist, so students should be checking their spelling before submitting their assignment.


Students will also create a Dictation Journal that focuses on spelling words in isolation as well as in
sentences. Spelling assessments will also incorporate a phrase or sentence that students must spell
correctly.


Foundational Skills 5


  - For the dictation journal, you can either have students use a journal they use for other writing
activities or you may wish to create a small dictation journal for each student. Stapling five pieces of
paper together is all you will need for each journal. (Lesson 1) ~~**TEKS 2.2.C.i; TEKS 2.2.C.iv**~~


**Grammar**


In Unit 5, students will continue to review previously taught grammar skills, including capitalization
and punctuation, use of apostrophes, and the identification of nouns and verbs as parts of speech.
New concepts introduced include adjectives as a new part of speech, the concept of verb tenses
(present, past, and future), and the components of a sentence, subject and predicate.


**Writing**


In Unit 5, students will continue to practice narrative writing. They will learn to brainstorm and
write a logically plausible, but different, ending to a story. They will first be introduced to this type
of writing activity using a story of your choice from _Sir Gus_ ; they will then rewrite an ending to the
story “Fire!” from _Sir Gus_ .


Students will edit their drafts for capitalization, end punctuation, commas in a series and in dates,
pronoun cases, and prepositions.


**Left-Handed Cursive Guidance**


Left-handed writers need to grip the writing instrument far enough back from the point to see what
is being written and not smear what has just been written. Have students grip the pencil around
1-1.5 inches from the point.


Have students tilt their paper so their arm is at a right angle to the bottom edge. This will allow the
wrist to sit at a natural arc while writing.


Have students write with their hands below the writing line and the wrist straight.


Immediately correct students who use a “hooked’ style of writing, because this may cause strain to
the wrist.


Allow your left-handed students to hold their pen or pencil with a relaxed grip, as gripping too tightly
can cause hand fatigue and strain.


Encourage your left-handed students to slant their writing to the left rather than to the right. This
will help them write more smoothly and with less smudging.


Model cursive letter formation for your left-handed students, showing them how to form each letter
from the left to the right.


Provide your left-handed students with plenty of practice time as they develop their skills.


**TEKS 2.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling one-syllable words with closed syllables; open syllables: VCe syllables: vowel teams,
including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables, and final stable syllables; (iv) spelling multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns.

~~**UNIT 5 ASSESSMENT**~~


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


Throughout this unit, formative assessments are clearly marked for monitoring individual student
performance and progress in key skills. You will also be promped to collect activity pages to monitor
student progress in reading and writing the spelling alternatives for /u/, /ә/, /әl/, and /shәn/, and
the Tricky Spellings ‘a,’ ‘e,’ ‘o,’ and ‘ou.’ You will also collect activity pages on which students are asked
to apply and demonstrate the grammar and writing skills taught in this unit. Quick “Checks for
Understanding” to evaluate students’ performance as a whole are also designated in
various lessons.


An analysis of students’ performance on weekly spelling assessments may also be a valuable tool in
gaining insight into specific gaps in code knowledge for individual students. You are encouraged to
use the spelling analysis tools provided in Teacher Resources to summarize data about the types of
errors students make.


In addition, continue using the Anecdotal Reading Record and Discussion Questions Observation
Record found in the Teacher Resources section at the end of this Teacher Guide, as well as the Story
Question Activity Pages. You should circulate and listen to students read, making notes as you listen.
You should strive to hear every student read aloud at least once or twice a week.


Careful attention to this information, collected on a daily basis, will enable you to quickly determine
which students may benefit from reteaching and/or more practice in particular skills using the
Additional Support activities found at the end of each lesson.


**Student Performance Assessment**


At the end of Unit 5, a series of both group and individual Student Performance Assessments occur
in Lessons 26–30. In Lesson 26, the first task is a whole group Reading Comprehension Assessment.
Students will be asked to silently read a selection from _Sir Gus_ and answer questions about what
they have read. After a short break students will be asked to complete a Grammar Assessment. This
assessment is cumulative and includes asking students to determine the tense of a verb in a given
sentence.


In Lesson 27, all students will complete a group Decoding Assessment. Students who do not
perform adequately on the Reading Comprehension Assessment from Lesson 26 or the Decoding
Assessment from Lesson 27 will be asked to sit individually with the teacher and complete
additional assessments to identify specific areas of difficulty.


In Lesson 28, students will be asked to demonstrate their mastery of writing Kite String Letters and
From the Top Letters in cursive.


Foundational Skills 5


~~**SMALL GROUP TIME**~~


Small group sessions are continued throughout Unit 5. Small group time is an opportunity for
you to work with students needing help with specific issues, such as difficulties with letter-sound
correspondences, fluency, and comprehension. It is also a time for you to work with the more
independent learners. Although activity pages and other activity suggestions are provided, you
should decide how this time can best be utilized to meet the specific needs of students.


~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice the Unit 5 skills can be found in the
Pausing Point section included at the end of the last lesson. It is strongly recommended that you
pause for 3 days and provide targeted remediation for individual or groups of students in any areas
in which they performed poorly on the end-of-unit assessment.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the _Fluency Supplement_, is available in the program’s online materials. This
component has been designed to complement the unit. In it you will find a poem, an informational
piece titled “Did You Know?”, a Reader’s Theater, a realistic fiction selection, and a science or social
studies selection. See directions in the _Fluency Supplement,_ for further guidance.


~~**APPENDICES**~~


Prior to teaching Lesson 7, please study Appendix A: More About Schwa (/ә/.) Once again Appendix
B: Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words is included at the end of this Teacher Guide.
Please use this as a resource when working with students who have not mastered the ability to
chunk words into syllables for decoding.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


In this section at the end of the Teacher’s Guide, you will find forms and charts which may be useful,
including the following:

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Over several lessons, you will teach spelling alternatives for the /u/ sound.
In this lesson, you will present an overview of the most frequent spelling
alternatives for /u/ using the Spelling Tree. During subsequent lessons this
week, you will target one or two specific spelling alternatives per lesson
using the Vowel Code Flip Book and Individual Code Chart.


These spellings include the basic code spelling ‘u’ as in _but_ and the spelling
alternatives ‘o’ as in _son_, ‘o_e’ as in _come_, and ‘ou’ as in _touch_ . The chart
shows the most common spellings for this sound. Students should already
know the basic code spelling ‘u’ as in _but_ .


Here are some patterns for your information:


  - The spelling ‘ **o** ’ is common. It appears in stressed ( _front, other, mother_ )
and unstressed syllables ( _consumer, second, button_ ), most often in
multisyllable words.


  - The spelling ‘ **ou** ’ appears in stressed ( _double, cousin_ ) and unstressed
syllables ( _famous, nervous_ ).

**Board Sort**

  - Tell students that today you will review the basic code spelling and introduce
new spelling alternatives for the sound /u/.


  - Have students say the sound /u/.


  - Give students two minutes to think of words with alternative spellings of the
/u/ sound. While students think, display the chart you created in advance or
display the digital version. Then call on students to contribute words with the
alternative spellings to the chart.


  - Write the words on the board in the appropriate columns, circling the
alternative spelling of /u/ in each word. For example, if a student says _some_,
list the word under the heading ‘o_e’ and circle the ‘o_e’. If a student says
_stuck_, list the word under the heading ‘u’ and circle the ‘u’. If a student says
_touch_, list the word under the heading ‘ou’, with the ‘ou’ circled.



Challenge


Remind students that they
already know the spelling
‘o_e’ stands for the /oe/
sound, but now they are
learning a new sound for this
spelling. Based on readiness,
have students work in pairs
to write one or two sentences
that include a word that
contains the spelling ‘o_e’.

to sound out to read. Tell them they will have to use their very best skills, such
as thinking about tricky spellings and chunking syllables, to sound out words.
Point out that they should also use context clues to see if the word they have
sounded out makes sense in the sentence in which it is used.


 - For sentence number 1, say to students, “I see some words in this sentence I am
not sure about, and I am going to use the rules I know to see if I can say them.”
Model sounding out the following words by using chunking and context clues:
_heard_ and _lightning_ . Make sure to emphasize students need to focus on meaning
in context as well as chunking, blending, and sounding out. For example:


   - _heard:_ “I can try to sound this out by saying /h/ /ee/ /ar/ /d/. No, that
doesn’t sound right. So I will try using what I know about r-controlled
vowels /h/ /er/ /d/. This seems close to the word heard—that means to
use my ears and listen. Let me try it in the sentence. (Read the sentence
using the correct word.) Yes, this word makes sense.”


   - _lightning:_ “I will try /l/ /i/ /g/ /h/ /t/ /n/ /ing/. No, that doesn’t sound like
any word I know. Oh, I see ‘igh’ and I know it sounds like /ie/, so I will try/l/
/ie/ /t/ /n/ /ing/. This word makes sense. Let me try it in the sentence.
(Read the sentence using the correct word.) Yes, this word makes sense.”


 - Follow the same procedure for sentence 3.


   - _buy:_ “I will try /b/ /u/ /y/. No, that doesn’t make any sense. Let me try /b/
/u/ /ee/. No, let me try /b/ /ee/. No, that doesn’t make sense. Let me try

A knight is a type of soldier who lived long ago during a time called the Middle
Ages. Most knights worked for kings, defending their kingdoms. Explain
that kings often honored knights who became famous for doing a great job
defending kingdoms. These knights earned the title _sir_, as in _Sir Gus_ .

However, in many fairy-tale stories, knights are fictional characters, who often
fight fictional dragons and break magic spells. This Reader, _Sir Gus_, is fictional.

Observation: Discussion Questions


Call on a different student to answer each question. Note student performance in the

Discussion Questions Observation Record, noting whether the question answered

was literal, inferential, or evaluative, and whether the student answered in a complete

sentence and/or cited evidence from the text.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to describe the plot by naming the main events in “The Thief.” Say:

“Let’s write a list of the most important events in the story, from beginning to end.”

_(thief steals king’s ring, king summons knights, Sir Gus appears without his horse,_

_king gives Sir Gus the royal horse, knights leave castle in search of the thief)_

~~**ADJECTIVE HUNT (10 MIN.)**~~


  - For this activity, students will complete an adjective hunt using the story
“The Beginning” from _Sir Gus_ . Review the definition of an adjective (a part
of speech describing a noun). Ask students to quickly provide one or two
adjectives for each of these nouns: _flower, book, pencil_ .


  - Then have students add the inflectional endings _–er_ and _–est_ to each
adjective. Point out that they have formed the comparative and superlative
forms of the adjectives. Remind them that comparative adjectives compare
two things, and superlative adjectives compare three or more things.


  - Now ask students to turn to Chapter 1 of _Sir Gus_ . Tell them they will be playing
a game called _Adjective Hunt_ . To play this game, students are to find as many
adjectives as they can in the story “The Beginning” as a guided activity. You will
record the words on the board to see how many adjectives they can find.


  - Begin with this sentence: “King Alfred was in charge of a large land that
stretched from the dark forests of the north to the sea in the south.”


  - Tell students that before looking for adjectives they need to first find the
nouns. Do this by identifying _land, forests_, and _sea_ as some of the nouns in
this sentence. Write the nouns on the board.


  - Show students the adjectives describing the nouns _land_ and _forests_ . ( _large_
and _dark_ ) Write these words on the board next to their respective nouns.


  - Direct students’ attention to the last sentence on page 10: “But Sir Gus liked
a long soak in a bathtub better than a fight.”


  - Have students identify the noun and adjective. _Soak_ is the noun, and _long_ is
the adjective.


  - If time permits, direct students’ attention to the sentence on page 10: “He
had a spear and a sword.”


  - Ask students to write down some adjectives to add to the sentence to
describe the spear and sword to make it more interesting. Have students

Foundational Skills 5



**48**


create additional adjectives by adding – _er_ and – _est_ to create the comparative
and superlative forms as well.


 - Students may supply adjectives such as: _sharp_, _sharper_, _sharpest_, _pointed_,
_long_, _longer_, _longest_, _diamond-handled_ .


 - Have students write a new sentence with their comparative or superlative
adjectives.


~~**ADJECTIVES (20 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** The goal of this lesson is not to have students memorize the
definitions of the adjectives presented, but to recognize _–ous_ as a suffix
that signals a word is an adjective.


 - Tell students they will learn about a group of adjectives ending in the suffix

  - _ous_ . Write ‘ous’ on the board. Tell students that ‘ous’ seems to be a tricky
spelling. We know ‘ou’ can sound like /ou/ or /u/. When ‘ous’ occurs at the
end of a word, it is sounded as /us/.


 - Write the word _famous_ on the board, and guide students as they sound it out. Tell
them that the word _famous_ is related to the word _fame_, so it describes a person
who is well known by many other people, such as a musician, actor, or athlete.


 - Ask students if they can think of other adjectives ending in the suffix _–ous_ .
Record their answers on the board.


 - Write the following adjectives on the board, underline ‘ous’, have students
sound out the word, and then discuss the meaning with students.


) **Digital Component 4.1**






- Have students pair each adjective with as many nouns as they can brainstorm.
For example, ask students to name some nouns that might be _enormous_ .


- Review that adjectives are describing words, and some adjectives have the
suffix – _ous_ .



Support


Students may need to
make several attempts to
decode _hideous_ . They may
try /hide/ /us/. Then they
might try /hide/ /ee/
/us/. If they do not do so
on their own, direct
them to try /hid/ /ee/
/us/; to sound out _jealous,_
students may first try /j/
/ee/ /l/ /ous/. Direct
them to try /j/ /e/
/l/ /ous/.

remainder of the story silently.


Observation: Anecdotal Reading Record


As students read, circulate throughout the room, listening to different students read.

Make note of students’ individual reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record.


**Reading**

 - After students have finished reading “All’s Well that Ends Well” with their
partners, lead students in a discussion of the text, using the following
strategies.


   - Ask text-dependent questions that require students to draw on
evidence from the text, identifying and discussing general academic
(Tier 2) vocabulary.


   - Discuss sections of the text that might pose difficulty due to complex
syntax, dense information, challenging transitions, or that require
inferences.


   - Engage students in a culminating writing activity completed
independently, if possible.


**Note:** In this lesson you will note the rigor of the reading lesson has
increased. In Units 2–4, students were asked simple questions as they
learned to carefully examine the text of a selection. In this lesson, students
will become aware of multiple-meaning words and reflect on the author’s
purpose in using them. Although particular focus is on the multiple-meaning
word _well_ in this chapter, there are other multiple-meaning words that
may be used to reinforce the concept that words can have more than one
meaning. It is up to your discretion, based on students’ needs and time
constraints, to further discuss these words.


Foundational Skills 5


 - During this reading, students will read “All’s Well that Ends Well” story using
Activity Page 4.1, instead of the Reader. Students will be asked to use the
different colored markers to circle each use of the multiple-meaning
word _well_ in the story on Activity Page 4.1, using a different colored marker
to designate each meaning of _well_ .


 - Using the chart you created in advance or the digital version, review the
three possible meanings using each in a sentence, noting that each different
meaning of _well_ also changes its part of speech.

will read from Activity Page 4.1 rather than the Reader.


  - Explain that they will need to pay special attention to the word _well_ that
occurs many times in the story. Each time they encounter the word _well_, you
will ask them to circle it with a particular color marker to show the meaning
of the word in each sentence: green for definition 1, blue for definition 2, and

 - Display the baseball diamond you prepared in advance or the digital version.


 - Divide the class into two teams, having one team at a time come to the front
of the room and line up in front of the board. (Alternately, you may choose to
have students stay seated and divide the class into teams by the manner in
which they are seated.) Each team takes a “turn at bat” as follows:


   - Set a timer for ten minutes, and tell students whichever team has the most
runs when the timer rings is the winning team. Point out that accuracy is
important, but so is speed when reading words quickly. The more turns
players have to read words, the more likely their team is to score runs.


   - Pick a card from the stack, and ask the first person on the team to read
it aloud. If the word is read correctly, draw a line from home plate to first
base, signifying a “hit.” This player then goes to the back of his or her
team’s line, while the next player comes forward to read the next card. If
he or she reads the word correctly, draw a line from first to second base.
Play continues this way. If the fourth player reads the word correctly, draw
a line from third base to home plate and mark “1 run” for the team. Play
continues for this team so long as no words are misread; when one word is
misread, the next team takes its turn at bat.


~~**DIFFERENTIATED INSTRUCTION (15 MIN.)**~~


**Small Group:** Use Activity Page 6.1 to work with students who need more
review in spellings of the /u/, /ee/, and /ie/ sounds. Have students read
each word in a column aloud and then circle the spelling.


**Independent:** Assign Activity Page 6.2 to students ready to work
independently on a grammar challenge. Explain that students are to hunt for
different parts of speech in the story “The Hungry Troll.”

Writing


**Primary Focus**
Students will develop handwriting by accurately forming all cursive letters using
appropriate strokes when connecting letters. ~~**TEKS 2.2.E**~~


~~**CURSIVE: FROM THE TOP LETTERS: UPPERCASE ‘D’ AND ‘L’ (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Print uppercase ‘D’ and ‘L’ on the board. Then slowly write each letter in
cursive underneath its printed counterpart.


  - Tell students that the letters in this group are called the From the Top Letters
because, unlike many other cursive letters, the writer starts forming them
from the top parts of the Letters.


  - Direct students to Activity Page 6.3. Then stand facing away from the class
and model writing each letter in the air. Have students do the same.


  - Model writing the two From the Top Letters, uppercase ‘D’ and ‘L’ in cursive
again, one at a time, on the board or using a projector that permits students
to see your hand movements. After modeling each letter, have students trace
and copy the letter on Activity Page 6.3.


    - If possible, project Digital Component 6.3 to model writing the letters.


  - Model writing a line or sentence from the activity page, having students copy
the words you model.


  - Have students complete the activity page. As they work, circulate and offer
assistance as needed.


  - Encourage students whose names begin with an uppercase letter that they
have learned to write their names in cursive at the top of the activity page,
starting with an uppercase letter.

~~**INTRODUCE SUBJECT AND PREDICATE (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students they are going to learn how the parts of speech they have
studied (nouns, verbs, adjectives) can be combined to make sentences.


  - Write the following sentence on the board: _The brown dog barked loudly._


  - Ask a student to read the sentence aloud. Ask students what comes at the
beginning and at the end of a sentence. _(a capital letter; a period or other final_
_punctuation mark)_


  - Point to the word _dog_ and ask students what part of speech it is. _(noun)_
Circle the word _dog_ .


  - Point to the word _barked_ and ask students what part of speech it is. _(verb)_
Draw a wiggly line under the word _barked_ .


**Note:** Students may ask what the remaining words in the sentence are called.
We will not teach articles, adverbs, or other parts of speech at this point;
however, if students ask about them, feel free to give them this information.


  - Point to the word _brown_ and ask students what part of speech it is.
_(adjective)_ Draw an arrow from _brown_ to _dog_ . This arrow shows the adjective
that describes the noun.


  - Tell students every sentence expresses a complete thought. In order to be
a complete thought, every sentence must have two parts: a subject and a
predicate. Write _subject_ and _predicate_ on the board, and read the words aloud.


  - Explain that the subject includes the different parts of speech telling who or
what a sentence is about. Ask students who or what this sentence is about.
_(the brown dog)_ Underline the _brown dog_ once. Explain that the subject often
contains a noun; in this case, the noun is _dog_ .


**TEKS 2.11.D** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including (i) complete sentences with subject-verb agreement; (iii)
singular, plural, common, and proper nouns; (iv) adjectives, including articles; **TEKS 2.2.B.i** Demonstrate and apply phonetic

words and use a dictionary or glossary to find words.


Foundational Skills 5


  - Explain that the subject may also contain some other words. Explain that the
subject of this sentence also contains the word _brown_, an adjective, as well as
the word _the._


  - Tell students that the other part of a complete sentence is the predicate.
The predicate describes what the subject is or does and always includes
a verb.


  - Ask what the subject, _the brown dog,_ is doing in this sentence. _(barking_
_loudly)_ Underline the predicate twice.


  - Reiterate that the predicate must always contain at least one verb.
Ask students to identify the verb in this sentence. _(barked)_


  - Explain the predicate may also contain some additional words.
The predicate of this sentence also includes the word _loudly_ .


  - Ask students which comes first in this sentence, the subject or the
predicate. _(the subject)_ Explain the subject comes before the predicate
in most English sentences, but not all of them.


  - Repeat the same steps for this sentence: _The blue fish swims in the bowl_ .


  - Have students identify the nouns, verb, and adjective: circle the nouns,
draw a wiggly line under the verb, and draw an arrow from the adjective
to the noun.


  - Next, remind students that the subject tells who or what the sentence is
about. Ask students to identify the subject and ask what this sentence is
about. _(the blue fish)_


  - Underline the subject _The blue fish_ once. Point out that the subject
includes the noun _fish_ .


  - Next, ask students to identify the predicate; what does the subject do?
_(swims in the bowl)_


  - Underline the predicate twice. Point out the predicate includes the
verb _swims_ .


  - Point out that _bowl_ is a noun, but it is part of the predicate. There are
many nouns in sentences, and you can’t assume a noun is always in the
subject of the sentence.


  - Ask which comes first in this sentence, the subject or the predicate.
_(subject)_


  - For the next sentence, distribute six word cards for _The bike rolled down_
_the hill_ . to six students.


Lesson 6 Grammar: Subject and Predicate
**81**


- Ask students to arrange themselves in front of the class so that the words
are in an order that makes sense.


- Discuss the parts of speech in the sentence.


- Ask students to identify the words making up the subject of the sentence.
(Remind them that the subject tells who or what the sentence is about.)


- Have a student “underline” the subject by holding an arm under the cards
for _The bike_ .


- Have another student identify the predicate and “double underline” it by
holding two arms under _rolled down the hill_ .


- Repeat these steps for at least one more of the sentences you prepared in
advance, discussing the sentence and marking the subject and predicate
with “arm underlining.”


- Write the following on the board:


  - Subject + Predicate = Complete Sentence


- Tell students that a sentence must have both subject and predicate to be
a complete sentence.


- Ask students, “If I just have the subject, do I have a complete sentence?”
_(no)_


- “If I have just the predicate, do I have a complete sentence?” _(no)_


- “What do I need in order to have a complete sentence?” _(both subject_
_and predicate)_

  - Tell students you will put the spelling words in alphabetical order by matching
the first letter of the word to the alphabet letters on the board. Remove the
spelling word cards one at a time from the board, and fold over and clip the
card so only the first letter of each word is visible. (See Lesson 1
for illustration.)


  - Ask students to tell you where each card belongs on the alphabet list. Tape
the cards one at a time beside the matching letter on the alphabet written on
the board.


  - Tell students that they will write an entire sentence that you dictate. Students
may use their Dictation Journal.

Lesson 7 Spelling Alternatives: Introduce /ə/ › ‘a’ and ‘e’
**87**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


In this lesson you will introduce students to the concept of schwa. Schwa can
be a major obstacle on the road to fluent reading and a serious impediment to
good spelling. The introduction to this unit describes schwa in detail, and it is
recommended that you read it before teaching this and the following lessons.


Read “The Spelling Spoilers,” a story about schwa, included in this lesson for
Foundational Skills. You will need to customize the text in some places (e.g.,
adding your name, the name of your school, and community).


**Foundational Skills**

 - Prepare to display the Vowel Code Flip Book within view of all students. You may
wish to tab page 6. Also have the Spelling Cards listed in the Lesson at a Glance
chart, student Individual Code Charts, and green markers readily available.

 - You will need to prepare a Spelling Tree for /ә/. For today’s lesson, prepare
two branches for the /ә/ Spelling Tree, one for ‘a’ and another for ‘e’.

   - Label the trunk /ә/.

   - Leaves for the ‘a’ branch: _about, alike, afraid, China, America, appear_


   - Leaves for the ‘e’ branch: _debate, appetite, decide,_ and _category_

   - You can use the names of students’ in your class to illustrate the /ә/; for
example, _Linda, Martha, Evan, Adam, Steven,_ and _Jeremy_ all include the
/ә/ sound.







**Digital Component 7.1**

**Primary Focus:** Students will learn the sound/spellings /ә/ > 'a' and 'e' and will
read two- and three-syllable words with these features.

~~**TEKS 2.2.B.i; TEKS 2.2.C.i; TEKS 2.2.C.iv**~~


~~**INTRODUCE / / > 'A' AND 'E' (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Before beginning the lesson, display the **Vowel Code Flip Book** and the
Spelling Cards you gathered in advance.


  - Ask students to provide some vowel sounds they have learned so far.
They may refer to the Individual Code Chart.


  - Remind students that every English word must contain a vowel sound.


  - Remind them that words containing more than one vowel sound also have
more than one syllable. A word has as many syllables as it has vowel sounds.


  - Tell students that today they are going to learn a new vowel sound. The name
of the sound is schwa, but that is not the sound it makes.


  - Write the word _schwa_ on the board. Explain the tricky part: ‘sch’ > /sh/.


  - Have the class say _schwa_ .


  - Write the symbol for schwa, / ə /, on the board and explain that this is the
symbol for schwa, a vowel sound.


  - Explain that the exact pronunciation of schwa differs from person to person,
place to place, and word to word. However, in many words and many parts
of the United States, schwa sounds a lot like /u/. In some words and some
regions of the United States, it is pronounced more like /i/. Write _about_ on
the board, and ask students how they might expect it to be pronounced.
_(They might expect it to be pronounced /a/ /b/ /ou/ /t/ or /ae/ /b/ /ou/ /t/.)_

  - Explain that this word is usually pronounced /ә/ /b/ /ou/ /t/.


  - Ask students if they can see how this could be a challenge when reading.
If students initially try to pronounce the first vowel sound in _about_ as /a/ or
/ae/, it will not sound like a recognizable English word. They will need to revise
their first try and replace the initial sound with a schwa sound similar to /u/.


**TEKS 2.2.B.i** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words with short, long, or variant vowels, trigraphs,
and blends; **TEKS 2.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling one-syllable and multisyllabic words with
closed syllables; open syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and
final stable syllables; (iv) spelling multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns.



Code Materials



Lesson 7 Spelling Alternatives: Introduce /ə/ › ‘a’ and ‘e’
**89**


- Ask students to consider how this can pose a problem for spelling as well.
If they spell _about_ the way it sounds, they may be tempted to write _ubout_ .


- Repeat the same steps with _afraid_ and _China_ . For each word, ask students
to generate a hypothetical pronunciation. Then tell them the actual
pronunciation. Discuss why each word might pose a problem while reading
and while spelling. Point out that students may be tempted to spell _afraid_
with an initial ‘u’ and _China_ with a final ‘u’.

- Tell students they will often see ‘a’ > /ә/ at the very beginning of a word,
as in _about_, or at the very end, as in _China_ .

- Students should hear a schwa in most of these words, but do not worry if
they only hear it in some of them. Remember: pronunciation varies from
person to person, word to word, and region to region.

Chart, page 7.


 - Direct students’ attention to the leaves you have prepared. Ask students to
read the leaves and tape them on the proper branch of the Spelling Tree.


**Note:** If _the, a, what,_ and _was_ are understood as containing the /ә/ sound, then
they are no longer tricky and you can remove them from the Tricky Word wall.


Check for Understanding


As students read and attempt to place the leaves, note which students struggle to

place the leaves correctly. Students who have trouble with this activity may need

additional support with reading words featuring schwa sound/spellings.

**"The Spelling Spoilers" Story**

 - Read aloud “The Spelling Spoilers” on the following pages. The story
describes a group of troublemakers called the Spelling Spoilers, who are
trying to ruin students’ spelling by convincing them to spell schwa with the
letter ‘u’.


 - You will also need to write on the board/chart paper as you present the
read-aloud.


 - Ask students to open their Activity Book to Activity Page 7.1


- **Digital Component 7.1**


 - Use your best “TV-villain voice” to make the Head Spelling Spoiler sound as
villainous as possible. His laughter is meant to sound like the schwa sound:
“/u/ . . . /u/ . . . /u/!” If you find that difficult to say, you can have him laugh
like this: “huh . . . huh . . . huh!


 - As you present the read-aloud, be sure to point out to students the pictures
of the Spelling Spoilers on Activity Page 7.1.

**The Spelling Spoilers**


Deep in his underground lair, the Head Spelling Spoiler spoke to the
other Spelling Spoilers.


“Fellow Spoilers, our plot to ruin spelling in the United States is
going well!”


He paused to let out a long cackle of strange-sounding laughter: “/u/ . .
. /u/ . . . /u/!”


- Point to the first picture on Activity Page 7.1.


The Head Spelling Spoiler went on: “There are lots of children out there
who can’t spell well. And there are lots of adults who can’t spell well
either. And, best of all, there are adults who are telling the children
that English spelling makes no sense. All of these things show that our
master plan to ruin spelling in this country is working!”


Then he cackled again: “/u/ . . . /u/ . . . /u/!”


All the other Spoilers began whispering happily among themselves.


Then the Head Spoiler lowered his voice and began speaking again.


“But I am afraid the news is not all good.”

The other Spoilers fell silent.


“I have received an alarming report from **[insert name of your town]** .
It seems the students at **[insert name of your school]** are learning
what they need to know to become very good spellers.”


The Spoilers fidgeted in their seats nervously.


“I am especially concerned about **[insert your name]** ’s class. I am told
students in that class know five ways to spell the /oe/ sound.”


The Spoilers complained.


“I am told students in **[insert your name]** ’s class know four ways to
spell the /ae/ sound.”


The Spoilers groaned. “And, worst of all, I am told students in **[insert**
**your name]** ’s class know seven ways to spell the /ee/ sound.”


The Spoilers gasped.


“No! It can’t be true!” cried one of the Spoilers.


Lesson 7 Spelling Alternatives: Introduce /ə/ › ‘a’ and ‘e’
**93**


**94**



The Head Spelling Spoiler spoke again: “Fellow Spoilers, I don’t have to
tell you the situation is serious. If those students can spell sounds like
/ae/, /oe/, and /ee/, they are on the verge of becoming good spellers.
There’s only one thing that can stop them from becoming really good
spellers. And that is our old friend, schwa.”


- Point to the schwa picture on Activity Page 7.1.


"Ah, yes, schwa!" The Spoilers all smiled and nodded. They knew that
schwa had been messing up children’s spelling for many years. Schwa
caused more spelling problems than almost anything else. It was a
Spelling Spoiler’s best friend.


“You Spoilers all know schwa is a sound that sounds a lot like /u/. But
it is not necessarily spelled with the letter ‘u’. And that’s just what we
need to ruin the children’s spelling! /u/ . . . /u/ . . . /u/!


“Now, the next few weeks are going to be very important. I want all of
you to make yourselves invisible. Then I want you to go out to **[insert**
**your name]** ’s classroom. Whenever the students are writing, and they
come to a word that has the schwa sound in it, I want you to be there,
whispering in their ears, ‘Spell it with a ‘u’! Spell it with a ‘u’!’”


All the Spoilers started to chant: “Spell it with a ‘u’! Spell it with a ‘u’!”


“That’s the spirit!” said the Head Spoiler. “If we can get them to spell
the schwa sound with a ‘u’, they will make hundreds of mistakes.”


He cackled: “/u/ . . . /u/ . . . /u/!”

~~**REVIEW SUBJECT AND PREDICATE (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Review subject and predicate:


    - The subject of a sentence tells who is doing something and contains
nouns. The subject often comes in the beginning of a sentence.


    - The predicate of a sentence contains the verb and tells what is happening
in the sentence.

**108**



~~**REVIEW SPELLING FOR / / AND /U/ (15 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** In this program, the /u/ sounds are not called schwa sounds. It is not
important for students to differentiate whether a spelling is an /u/ or a schwa sound.
What is important, however, is that they can read and write the words correctly.


 - Remind students that they learned a new sound in the last lesson. Ask
students to provide the name for this sound. _(schwa_ ) Point to the ‘a’ and ‘e’
spellings for /ә/ in the Vowel Code Flip Book, and read the example words.

 - Point to the /ә/ Tree, reading the words on the leaves aloud. Remind
students that they should hear /ә/ in most of these words, but they should
not worry if they only hear it in some. **Note:** Remember that pronunciation
varies from person to person, word to word, and region to region.

 - Have students identify the different ways /ә/ is spelled.


 - Point to the /u/ Spelling Tree. Review a few words on this tree by pointing
randomly to words and having students read the words aloud. Have students
identify the different ways /u/ is spelled.


 - Ask students to take out Activity Page 8.1. Tell students it is time to try to
beat the Spelling Spoilers by spelling the /ә/ and the /u/ sounds they have
learned in this unit correctly.


 - Write _about_ on the board, and read it aloud. Point out that even though the
first sound in _about_ is /ә/, the first letter in the printed word is ‘a’.


 - Have students copy _about_ into the far left column labeled “Copy.” They
should say the sound of each letter as they copy the word.


 - Erase the word from the board.


 - Have students fold the activity page along the dotted line so _about_ is facing
down on the desk.


 - Have students write _about_ from memory in the middle column labeled
“Spell.” They should say the sound of each letter as they write the word.


 - Tell students to unfold the activity page and compare the word they just
wrote from memory with the word they copied earlier.


Foundational Skills 5


 - If any students spelled the word incorrectly, have them correct the incorrect
spelling and print the correct spelling.


 - Tell students to make a mark on the activity page indicating whether they
beat the Spelling Spoilers or not.


 - Repeat these steps with the remaining words in the following box.


**Note:** The letter or letters in each word for the schwa or the /u/ sounds are bolded.

To be certain students are
following the storyline, it
may be helpful to read the
story in chunks, pausing
often to make sure they
know what happened
before reading on: “Does
this make sense?” “What
do I want to know?” Review
the story structure to
help comprehension.
Fictional texts generally
include a problem, rising
action, resolution, and
falling action. The action
rises until the problem is
resolved, then the story
action falls.


**112**



**Purpose for Reading**

  - Ask students if they think Sir Gus will offer to use fire to bravely scare away
the troll. Ask students to give you examples from past stories to explain why
they think Sir Gus will not be brave when fighting the troll. Tell students that
while reading today’s story, they should focus on identifying the main events,
the conflict involving Sir Gus and the troll, and how this conflict is resolved.
They should also find out how Sir Gus will react when he is near the troll to
understand how these reactions contribute to the story.


~~**READ “FIRE!” (20 MIN.)**~~


**Whole Group**

  - Have students read the first page of the story silently to themselves. Then
have one or more students read the same page aloud. Continue reading the
story in this fashion. If time does not allow for reading the entire story this
way, continue by reading the rest of the story aloud after completing at least
two or three pages of both silent and oral reading.


  - At the end of each page, ask students if there are any parts of the story
they are confused about. If there are, have students ask questions to clear
up their confusion. ~~**TEKS 2.6.B**~~


  - Have students look at the illustration on **page 45** of the Reader. Point out
that there is an empty hill with a few dying trees. Have students look closely
at the illustration. Ask students: What do you think Sir Tom and the knights
might be doing? Do you think the knights found the troll? Ask students if they
have any questions about the illustration.


  - Have students look at the illustration on **page 47** . Ask them what the
illustration suggests about the knights’ plan.


**TEKS 2.6.B** Generate questions about text before, during, and after reading to deepen understanding and gain information.


Foundational Skills 5


  - On **page 48**, when Sir Gus says, “But, but . . . well . . . I . . . er . . . um . . .,”
model for students how to give appropriate pauses for the ellipses. Ask
students if Sir Gus wanted to be the knight who tried to frighten the troll.


  - After reading **page 50**, ask students how the pieces of rock came flying out
of the cave. Ask them what thoughts or questions they may have about the
text or the illustration to help them understand the story better.


  - After reading **page 52**, ask students if they think that Sir Gus was
really brave. Ask them who they think gave the scream that came “from
inside the cave,” Sir Gus or the Troll? Have them explain their answer.


**Wrap-Up**

  - Turn and Talk: Describe the main events of the story. How do you know?


  - Have students retell the main events as you write them down on chart paper
or on the board.


  - Provide feedback and guidance to ensure students have described the main

_place of the letters.)_


  - Show each index card one at a time, asking students to say a sentence using
the words on the card.


  - As students give you a sentence, tape the word cards randomly to the board.


  - After you have been through all the cards, ask students to read the cards
aloud with you.


  - Ask students to help you match the contractions to the word pairs. Make
sure you put the contractions and the words making the contractions in two
columns, side by side.


  - Remind students that _’s_ is also used to form possessives.


  - Refer to the following phrases you prepared in advance.

**Literacy Skills**


Support emergent
bilingual students by
offering them ways to
collaborate with others to
discuss ideas, interpret
information, and present
and defend claims. Before
independent reading, show
students pictures in the
Reader and teach them
specific vocabulary words.
For example, to start a
discussion, ask whether
they like boats or water.


~~**ELPS 1.E; ELPS 3.E**~~


Support


Encourage students
to record at least one
unfamiliar word seen in
the text. Help them chunk,
define (using context
clues), and say the word.
Then suggest that to
remember the word, they
should try to use it often.


**120**




 - Ask students to tell you the page on which “The Boat Trip” begins. _(page 56)_


 - Remind students that Sir Gus does not like water. Ask them what they think a
boat ride would be like for Sir Gus.


**Preview Spellings**

 - Before reading today’s story, preteach the Tricky Word _water_ . The ‘a’ sounds
like /aw/.


 - Remind students that they may come across words they have not seen
before. They are to use their word skills, chunking into syllables, and context
clues to determine the correct pronunciation.


 - Preview the following spellings before reading today’s story. Remind students
what they have learned about VCe syllables forming long vowel sounds as
they read the /ae/ > ‘a’ words.

**Purpose for Reading**






 - Tell students to read carefully and sound out unfamiliar words. Ask students
to think about what type of adventures/troubles a person might encounter
when out at sea on a boat.


~~**READ “THE BOAT TRIP” (25 MIN.)**~~


**Partner Reading**

 - Remind students that they will each read the first page silently, then one
partner will read that page aloud. Next, they will both read the second page
silently, then the other partner will read that page aloud, and so on. As they
read, have partners take turns sharing background knowledge about boats.
Remind students to use the Individual Code Chart to help sound out words
and to ask their partners questions when they encounter confusing parts in
the story.


Observation: Anecdotal Reading Record


As students work in pairs, circulate throughout the room, listening to different students

read. Make note of individual students’ reading abilities in the Anecdotal Reading Record.



Support


When reading the story,
call students’ attention
to the sentence _He lay in_
_the bottom of the boat_
_moaning and groaning._ Say
the sentence aloud, _“He lay_
_in the bottom of the boat_
_moaning and groaning.”_
Explain that when a person
moans and groans, they
make sounds that mean,
_“I am in pain.”_ Ask: “What
is the difference between
_moaning_ and _groaning_ and
saying, _‘_ I am in pain.’ _”_ ?

what they think the correct response may be.


 - The first group should then announce which words are the subject and which
are the predicate. Each of the remaining groups decide whether they agree
or disagree, announcing their decision by saying, “Agree” or “Challenge.”
Any group that “challenges” must indicate the correct subject and predicate.


 - After all groups have responded, the referee should provide the correct
response. Any group that responded correctly receives one point. In addition,
any group that “challenged” the first group and was able to provide the
correct subject and predicate gets an extra point. Continue to play until all
groups have had at least one turn at drawing and reading a sentence strip.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today you will introduce students to other spelling alternatives for /ə/ when
combined with the letter ‘l’.


The chart shows the most common spellings for this sound combination
when it falls at the end of a word. /əl/ and /ul/ are considered here.





Students have already learned how to write the sound /u/ with a ‘u’ and the
sound /l/ with a single ‘l’ or the double-letter spelling ‘ll’. So they should
be able to read certain words that end in /əl/, like _awful_ and _dull_ . However,
as you saw from the chart, these spellings are less common than most the
alternatives introduced in this lesson.


Here are some patterns for your information:


  - The percentages in the chart focus on the ‘ **al** ’, ‘ **ul** ’, and ‘ **il** ’ spellings at the end
of a word. Some of these spellings also occur in the middle of a word
( _family, happily_ ).


  - The ‘ **al** ’ and ‘ **ul** ’ spellings appear frequently in adjectives ( _final, normal,_
_formal, awful, helpful_ ).


  - The ‘ **le** ’ and ‘ **el** ’ spellings are more common in nouns ( _apple, uncle, eagle,_
_wrinkle, angel, chapel_ ), though they can also be found in other parts of
speech ( _rattle, purple, little, grovel_ ).


  - The ‘ **il** ’ combination is rare but does occur in some frequently used words.


Lesson 11 Spelling Alternatives: Introduce /ə + /l/ › ‘ul,’ ‘al,’ and ‘il’
**135**


**Foundational Skills**

 - You can create a new tree for /əl/ or just add new branches to the /ə/ Tree.
(See the Introduction of this Teacher Guide for more information.)


 - You will need three new branches for the Spelling Tree, one each for ‘al’, ‘il’,
and ‘ul’.


 - Write the following words on leaves: _helpful, cheerful, wonderful, animal,_
_metal, total, royal, principal, typical, normal, practical, signal, pencil, evil, April,_
_fossil, nostril._


 - Prepare to display the Vowel Code Flip Book within view of all students. You
may wish to tab page 7. Also have the Spelling Cards listed in the Lesson at
a Glance chart, student Individual Code Charts, and green and red markers
readily available.

**Preview Spellings**

 - Begin by preteaching the Tricky Words _ghost_ and _again_ . Students might think
the ‘gh’ in _ghost_ would be pronounced /g/ /h/, but these letters stand for the
/g/ sound. Students might think the ‘ai’ in _again_ would be pronounced /ae/,
but in this word these letters stand for the /e/ sound.


 - Remind students that they can use what they have learned about syllable
division patterns VCV, VCCV, and VCCCV to chunk and read these words. For
example, again can be divided after the first vowel sound: _a•gain_ .

pirates? What do they
want? Have you read
other stories that had
similar characters?” (First
establish that the pirates
represent trouble. Then
have students connect
this idea to other stories
by identifying characters
who cause trouble.)

~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii; TEKS 2.2.C.i; TEKS 2.2.C.iv; TEKS 2.2.D**~~


~~**INTRODUCE SPELLING WORDS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Read each spelling word to students, and then have students read aloud each
word as you tape the spelling words to the board in random order. Point out
that each word contains ‘ie’ as the /ee/ sound.


  - Remind students what they have learned about reading words with open
syllables. Point out the /ae/ sound in _ba•bies_ and the /ee/ sound in _re•lief_ .


  - Have students guide you in circling the ‘ie’ spelling for the /ee/ sound in
each word.


  - Remind students that they have been practicing placing words into alphabetical
order. Discuss the importance of knowing how to alphabetize words.


  - Tell students you have been putting the spelling words in alphabetical order by
matching the first letter of the word to the alphabet on the board. Today you will
begin putting words in alphabetical order by looking at the alphabet list only
for reference. They should look at the alphabet list when deciding which letter
comes first on the word cards. Remove the word cards one at a time from the
board. Ask students to read them aloud once more as you remove them.


  - Hold up the word cards for _babies_ and _field_ . Ask students, “Which letter
comes first in the alphabet, ‘b’ or ‘f’?”


  - When students say ‘b’, tape the card for _babies_ on the board some distance
away from the alphabet strip. Today you are not matching the letters from
the alphabet with the words. Then tape the word card for _field_ underneath
_babies_ on the board, leaving space between the words.


  - Hold up the cards for _cookies_ and _achieve_ . Ask students, “Which letter comes
first in the alphabet, ‘c’ or ‘a’?”


  - When students say ‘a’, tape the word card for _achieve_ on the board above
_babies_ and the word card for _cookies_ underneath _babies_, leaving space
between the words.


  - Continue in this way through the rest of the spelling words. Have all
students read the words aloud and tell students the spelling words are
now in alphabetical order.

Support


Preview the lessons to
target content that may be
particularly challenging.
For example, if students are
struggling, give them two
index cards and have them
say the word and tap the
syllables. Have them write
the letters in the syllables
on each card (such as _den_
and _tist_ ) and then segment
the sounds in order to
decode and read the word
(/d/, /e/, /n/, _den_ ; /t/, /i/,
/s/, /t/, _tist_ : _den-tist_ ).


**154**




- Turn to **Vowel Code Flip Book page 7** and put the Spelling Cards /ə/ + /l/>
‘el’ ( _travel_ ) and /ə/ + /l/ > ‘le’ ( _apple_ ) on the appropriate space.
Have students read the sample word. Discuss the power bar.


- Today’s letter-sound correspondences can be found on the following pages
of the Individual Code Chart.






 - Distribute the green and red markers. Have students turn to **Individual Code**
**Chart page 8** . Guide students in outlining the appropriate cards ‘el’ > /ə/ +
/l/ and ‘le’ > /ə/ + /l/ on the chart.

 - Point out the new branches for the /ə/ or /ə/ + /l/ Tree, ‘el’ and ‘le’.


 - Show students the leaves you have prepared. Distribute the leaves to student
groups. Ask them to circle the spellings of the /ə/ + /l/ on each leaf and
attach them to the correct tree and branch.


~~**REVIEW SYLLABLE CHUNKING (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Refer to the chart you prepared in advance and read the following words:


) **Digital Component 13.1**










- Point out that the vowel sound in these syllables is a closed syllable and
produced a short vowel sound, because the syllable ends in a consonant.
Remind students to use what they know about syllable division pattern VCCV
to read the words. For example, _discuss_ can be read _dis•cuss_ because VCCV
words can be divided between the consonants.


Foundational Skills 5


 - Refer to the chart you prepared in advance and ask students to read the
following words with you:


) **Digital Component 13.2**










 - Point out that the first syllable in each word ends with a vowel sound and as
a result represents the long vowel sound. (Remember that an open syllable is
one that ends in a vowel, making the vowel sound a long sound, and a closed
syllable is one that ends in a consonant, which makes the vowel sound a
short sound.)


 - Review each word, emphasizing the long sound at the end of the first syllable.


 - Tell students that they have been practicing reading words with these syllable
patterns for several months, so they should be very familiar with reading
these types of words.


 - Now, direct students’ attention to the /ə/ or /ə/ + /l/ Tree and the ‘le’
branch, explaining that students will now learn a new syllable pattern.


 - Point out to students that on this branch, all the ‘le’ words have a consonant
before the ‘le’. This is a new syllable pattern. When chunking syllables with
words ending in ‘le’, the preceding consonant and ‘le’ are a separate syllable.


 - Refer to the chart you prepared in advance and point out that these words all
end in a consonant plus ‘le’. Call attention to how these words are divided into
syllables, with the consonant plus ‘le’ as one syllable. Ask students to read
the words.


) **Digital Component 13.3**










  - Point out that in the first five words, the first syllable is a closed syllable (ending
in a consonant and producing a short vowel sound) and the first syllable in the
next five words ends in a vowel and produces the long vowel sound.


Lesson 13 Spelling Alternatives: Introduce /ə/ + /l/ › ‘el’ and ‘le’ and Syllable Review

**Primary Focus:** Students will read “The Letter” with purpose and understanding
and will answer literal and inferential questions about key details in the text.


~~**TEKS 2.4; TEKS 2.7.C; TEKS 2.7.D**~~


~~**INTRODUCE THE CHAPTER (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students to summarize what happened in the last story, “The King’s Ghost.”
Lead students through this process by first asking them to tell you the main
characters, the major events, and the story’s ending. (You may wish to record
their answers on the board.) With the information provided, summarize the story:


    - The king and his knights went out to sea and pirates approached their ship.
The pirates told the knights they had to give up the king and the boat. Sir Gus
made scary-sounding noises because Sir Gus was seasick, and Sir Tom told
the pirates the sounds were from the boat’s ghost. The pirates were scared of
the ghost and they went away. King Alfred wanted to reward Sir Gus for being
clever and brave, pretending to be a ghost, but Sir Gus was really just seasick.


**Preview Spellings**

  - Begin by preteaching the Tricky Word _bridge_ . The students might think the
‘dge’ in _bridge_ would be pronounced /d/ /j/, but these letters stand for the
/j/ sound. ‘dge’ is a spelling for /j/, also found in words like _judge_ and _fudge_ .


  - Preview the following spellings before reading today’s story.

continue reading the story in this same fashion.


 - Tell students that if they are confused as they read, they should raise
their hands to ask a question.


 - After reading **page 72**, make sure students understand the humor when
Sir Gus says he had a nasty run-in with a llama. (Llamas are peaceful
animals.)


 - At the end of the story, the knights smile and chuckle. Ask students why
they do this. _(The knights knew they tricked the king into thinking Sir Gus_
_was volunteering to fight the fearsome beast.)_


**Wrap-Up**

 - Use the following questions to guide discussion about the story. Remember
to encourage students to answer in complete sentences. When answering a
question, ask students to cite the part of the story that guided their answer.

~~**MORE HELP WITH / / + /L/ AND ITS SPELLINGS**~~


  - Select ten to twenty /ə/ + /l/ words from the following box. Write the words
on the board in alphabetical or random order. Pass out **lined paper** . Ask
students to sort the words into columns based on which spelling stands
for /ə/ + /l/ (‘ul’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’, ‘le’).


  - Remind students that they can use what they have learned about
syllable division patterns VCV, VCCV, and VCCCV to read the words. For
example, VCCCV words can be divided after the first or second consonant
depending on the word. In the case of _helpful_, the ‘l’ and ‘p’ blend together,
so we can divide the word _help•ful_ .


**Note:** If students need additional scaffolding, you can underline the target
spelling in each word.

  - Remind students that they have learned many spellings so far, and in the
past few units, including this one, the focus has been on vowel sounds. Most
recently, they have learned different spelling alternatives for the following
sounds: /u/, /ə/, and /ə/ + /l/.


  - Tell students they will now review these sounds on Activity Page 14.1.


  - Remind students of what they have learned about using syllable patterns
to read words. For example, the word _jungle_ fits in the VCCCV pattern, and
because ‘n’ and ‘g’ are a blend, the word can be divided _jung•le_ .


  - Have students first read all the words in the box, naming the sound in
each word and underlining the particular spelling alternative in each word.
Repeat with the words in the box on the back page.


  - Then direct students to complete the sentences on the front and back.

~~**INTRODUCE /SH/ + /**~~ ~~**ə**~~ ~~**/ + /N/ › ‘TION’ (5 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.3.C**~~


  - Tell students that today they will learn a word ending that includes the /ə/
sound. Write the ‘tion’ on that suffix, which is pronounced /shən/, is often
added to the ends of words. The suffix _–tion_ changes a verb to a noun. It
describes a state, action, or process.


  - Write the following words on the board, and ask students to read each word
as you write it:


    - _action, section, portion, function, fiction, emotion_


  - Have students help you circle the spelling for the /shən/ sound (‘tion’). Point
out that – _tion_ is a separate syllable. If students have difficulty sounding out
these words, show them how to chunk the syllables. Then have students use
their own paper to write the word substitute and use it in a sentence. Then
model how to drop the final _e_ and add _–tion_ to form the word _substitution_ .
Have them write a new sentence using the word _substitution_ .

the use of the word as a noun.


  - Distribute the previously prepared leaves to student groups. Have students
circle the ‘tion’ spelling that is pronounced /shən/.


  - Ask students to read the word aloud to their class and use it in a different

**Purpose for Reading**

  - Review with students the people/things Sir Gus has “battled” so far: a thief,
a troll, and pirates. Ask students to tell you how Sir Gus defeated all of these
characters. Point out that luck has been the reason Sir Gus has won all of
these battles. Based on this pattern, ask students to predict how things will
go with Sir Gus looking for a fearsome beast. Ask them to read today’s story
to find out if their predictions are correct.

should ask questions about the text, before, during, and after to understand
the story.


**TEKS 2.6.B** Generate questions about text before, during, and after reading to deepen understanding and gain information.


Foundational Skills 5


 - Before going over the discussion questions, ask students to summarize the
story. Lead them in doing this by first asking for the main characters of the
story. Next ask them for the main events. Remind students that a summary
of a story tells just the basics of what happened. Have a student summarize
the story; they should say something like this: “Sir Gus went to fight the
fearsome beast and was captured in the Woods of Doom by bandits. The
fearsome beast came to attack the bandits and was blinded by Sir Gus’s
shining helmet. The fearsome beast stumbled into the Dark Dismal Swamp
and sank into the mud. Sir Gus reported to King Alfred that the beast was
now at the bottom of the swamp and the king thought Sir Gus had been very
brave. Really, Sir Gus had just been lucky.”


**Wrap-Up**

 - Use the following questions to guide discussion about the story. Remember
to encourage students to answer in complete sentences. When answering a
question, ask students to cite the part of the story that guided their answer.

Lesson 16 Review: Suffix –tion
**183**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Foundational Skills**

 - Many of this week’s spelling words begin with the same letter and thus far
students have learned to put words in alphabetical order based on just the
initial letter of each word. For this reason, you will practice putting only a
selected number of spelling words in alphabetical order today. Write only these
words on index cards: _yelled, myth, symbol, cry, frying, lying, edge._ (Later in the
year, students will learn how to alphabetize using the second letter in a word.)


**Start Lesson**



**Lesson 16: The /sh/ + /** ə **/ + /n/ Sound and Its Spellings**
Foundational Skills


**Primary Focus:** Students will decode words with the common suffix
/sh/ + /ə/ + /n/ > ‘tion’. ~~**[TEKS 2.2.B.v; TEKS 2.3.C ]**~~


~~**REVIEW /SH/ + /**~~ ~~**ə**~~ ~~**/ + /N/ › ‘TION’ (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students they have learned many spellings for the /ə/ sound.



20M



Activity Page 16.1




  - Point to each of the following branches of the /ə/ Tree(s) and name the
spelling, reading one sample word from each branch: /ə/ > ‘a’, ‘e’, /ə/ + /l/ >
‘al’, ‘il’, ‘ul’, ‘el’, ‘le’.


  - Now point to the ‘tion’ branch and have students read the leaves with the
‘tion’ spelling. Remind students that adding the suffix _–tion_ to a verb changes
it to a noun. Words with _–tion_ describe a state, action, or process.


  - Write direct on the board/chart paper. Have students read the word and use
their own paper to write it in a sentence. Then write _direction_ on the board
and point out that because the word already ends in _’t’_ you will simply add
_ion_ . Then have students write _direction_ in a sentence.


~~**PRACTICE /**~~ ~~**ə**~~ ~~**/, /**~~ ~~**ə**~~ ~~**/ + /L/, AND /U/(15 MIN.)**~~


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 16.1. Students will now practice the
spellings they have learned in Unit 5.


  - Have students first read the words in the boxes independently. Remind
students that they can use what they have learned about syllable division
patterns to read the words. For example, _helpful_ can be read using the VCCCV
pattern: _help•ful_ .


**TEKS 2.2.B.v** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words using knowledge of syllable division patterns
such as VCCV, VCV, and VCCCV; **TEKS 2.3.C** Identify the meaning of and use words with affixes un-, re-, -ly, -er, and -est
(comparative and superlative), and -ion/tion/sion.


Foundational Skills 5



**184**


  - Then read the words aloud from the word boxes on the front and back as a class,
circling the spellings as you go.


  - Tell students that there are eight words in each box, but only six sentences. This
means words will be left over. Ask students to complete this activity independently.


Activity Page 16.1: Fill in the Blanks


Collect and review Activity Page 16.1 to monitor students’ progress with reading

words with spelling alternatives for /u/ and /ə/.


**Lesson 16: Re-Reading: “The Fearsome Beast”**
25M
Reading


**Primary Focus:** Students will re-read “The Fearsome Beast” in partners and will
identify Tier 2 vocabulary, answer text-dependent questions, and discuss difficult
passages in the text. ~~**[TEKS 2.6.F; TEKS 2.7.E; TEKS 2.8.C]**~~


Students will discuss the author’s use of print and graphic features to achieve
specific purposes. ~~**[TEKS 2.10.C]**~~


~~**RE-READ “THE FEARSOME BEAST” (25 MIN.)**~~


  - Since students have already read “The Fearsome Beast” in the previous
lesson, lead students in a purposeful re-reading of the text by doing the
following:

    - Ask text-dependent questions that require students to draw on evidence
from the text.

    - Identify and discuss general academic (Tier 2) vocabulary.

    - Discuss sections of the text that might pose difficulty due to complex
syntax, dense information, challenging transitions, or ideas that
require inferences.

    - Engage students in a culminating writing activity completed
independently, if possible.


  - Students may respond to the questions you present in many ways. You can
change the way in which you ask for students’ responses in each lesson, or
even during the lesson, to improve student engagement.


  - For today’s lesson, have students work as partners. Following each question,
direct students to consult with their partner about the correct response,
before one student then raises his/her hand to respond.

Students will spell one-syllable and multisyllabic words with closed syllables.


~~**TEKS 2.2.C.i**~~


~~**INTRODUCE SPELLING WORDS (15 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.2.C.i**~~


  - Tell students that their spelling words for this week have the tricky spelling
‘y’. Have students look at their Individual Code Charts. Ask them to tell you
the four sounds ‘y’ represents (/ee/, /i/, /ie/, /y/) and give an example word
for each. Have students take out Activity Page 16.3 and look at their spelling
words while you read them aloud. After each word, have students tell you
which sound the spelling ‘y’ represents.


  - Explain to students that they can use what they have learned about decoding
open syllables when they spell words. Say, “In the word _frying_ I hear the /ie/
sound, so I know it has an open syllable and will be spelled like this: _f r y i n g_ .

  - Tape the selected spelling word cards to the board in random order, reading
them aloud as you go.


  - Hold up the word cards for _edge_ and _myth_ . Ask students, “Which letter comes
first in the alphabet, ‘e’ or ‘m’?”


  - Tape the word card for _edge_ on the board when students answer ‘e’. (You are
not matching the letter with the alphabet strip.) Tape the word card for _myth_
underneath _edge_ on the board, leaving space between the cards.


  - Hold up the word cards for _cry_ and _frying_ . Ask students, “Which letter comes
first in the alphabet, ‘c’ or ‘f’?”


  - When students say ‘c’, tape the word card for _cry_ on the board above
_edge_ and the word card for _frying_ underneath _edge_, leaving space
between the cards.


  - Slowly sing the alphabet song, stopping and pointing to the first letter in
each word when you sing the matching letter: “A B C (point to ‘c’ in _cry_ )

**Lesson 17: Changing Action Verb Tense**
40M
Language


**Primary Focus:** Students will identify the verbs in sentences, will distinguish
between the present and past tense, and will provide the present- and past-tense
versions of verbs. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.vi; TEKS 2.2.C.vi; TEKS 2.3.C**~~


Students will decode, spell, and use words with the prefix _dis_ –.


~~**TEKS 2.2.B.vi; TEKS 2.2.C.vi; TEKS 2.3.C**~~


~~**REVIEW ACTION VERBS AND TO BE (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students they have learned about verbs. Ask them to recall the two
kinds of verbs they have learned. _(action and to be)_


  - Tell students you are going to orally review some verbs by playing a game.


  - Divide students into four groups.


  - Tell students that you will read a sentence to one group of students, and
they will identify the verb in the sentence. All other groups should think of
the answer as well, just in case the group called upon gives the wrong answer.
After one group responds, ask students in each of the other groups to use
a thumbs-up or thumbs-down signal to indicate if they agree.


  - Use sentences or phrases from the following box.


  - The group with the most points wins.


**TEKS 2.2.B.vi** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words with prefixes including un-, re-, and dis-,
and inflectional endings, including -s, -es, -ed, -ing, -er, and -est; **TEKS 2.2.C.vi** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge
by spelling words with prefixes, including un-, re-, and dis-, and inflectional endings, including -s, -es, -ed, -ing, -er, and -est;
**TEKS 2.3.C** identify the meaning of and use words with affixes un-, re-, -ly, -er, and -est (comparative and superlative), and
-ion/tion/sion.


Foundational Skills 5


~~**REVIEW PRESENT- AND PAST-TENSE VERBS (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students we can change the form of a verb to indicate whether something
is happening now, happened in the past, or will happen in the future.


 - Give an example of a single verb in three tenses [e.g., “I walk.” (present
tense), “I walked.” (past tense), “I will walk.” (future tense)].


 - Tell students that today you will focus on verbs in the present and past tense.


 - Tell students that _past tense_ means something has already happened and is
over and done. _Present tense_ means something is currently taking place.


 - Provide students with some examples of the difference between present and
past tense: “I paint today.” (present) “Yesterday, I painted.” (past).

Call on different students as you complete Activity Page 17.1. Monitor student responses,

making note of any student who appears to struggle or who hesitates in responding.


~~**DECODE, SPELL, AND USE WORDS WITH PREFIXES (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain to students that we can decode, or read, words with prefixes by
segmenting and blending the sounds and using the syllable chunking method.


 - Tell them that prefixes are word parts added to the beginning of a base word to
change the meaning of the word. Some prefixes include _un–, dis–, in–, re–, pre,_

_mis–, non–,_ and _ex–_ . Each of these prefixes is one syllable.


- Say, “Let’s focus on the prefix _dis_ –.”


- Display some of the following words.◦


  - disable, disobey, disbelief, dislike, disappear, disagree, disloyal, discomfort,
disservice, disrespect, disorder


- Say, “I see the prefix _dis_ - /d/ /i/ /s/. I am going to segment the rest of the
word: /o/ /b/ /ay/. Now I can blend the entire word: dis•obey.”


- Pause between the syllables. Underline the _dis–_ in _disobey_ .


- Say, “Dis•obey There are two syllables. The prefix _dis_ - is one of the syllables.”


- Say the word again, clapping if needed to highlight the syllables. Repeat the
routine as needed with other words from the list.


- Next, explain to students that prefixes change the meaning of the word. For
example, _obey_ becomes disobey when we add the prefix _dis_ –, which means
“not.” _Disobey_ means “not obey.”


- Say, “For words with prefixes, the spelling of the base word does not change
when the prefix is added.”


- Finally, explain that when students come across a word with a prefix while
reading, breaking the word into its parts: prefix and base word, can help them
understand what the word means.


- Point to the word _dislike_ on the board.


- Say, “Let’s identify the meaning of this word by breaking it into its parts. I’m
going to draw a line between the prefix and the base word. Where should I
draw the line?” _(after the prefix dis–)._


- Ask, “What is the base word?” _(like)_ . “What does the word _like_ mean?” _(to enjoy)_


- Say, “If we add the prefix _dis_ - at the beginning of _like_, how does the meaning
of the word change? _(It means to not enjoy.)_


- For practice, have small groups use their own paper to create and identify the
meaning of words with the prefix _dis_ –. Provide base words and have them
add prefixes. Have volunteers share their words and their meanings. Offer
feedback as needed.

**Primary Focus:** Students will brainstorm an alternative ending to a chapter from
_Sir Gus_ and will write a new ending for the chapter. ~~**TEKS 2.11.A**~~


~~**WRITE A DIFFERENT ENDING (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that today they will learn how to change the ending of a story.
They should listen carefully as you read a familiar story.


  - Read a chapter of your choice from _Sir Gus_ .


  - Tell students you will begin by brainstorming “What if?” questions specific to
the story you just read that might help them think of a different way the story
might end.







**Digital Component 17.2**




  - Use one or two of these questions to model how to ask a “What if?” question.
Ask students to record the questions on Activity Page 17.2:


    - What if Sir Gus had not ?


    - What if King Alfred had ?


    - What if the knights had not ?


  - Then ask students to brainstorm one or two “What if?” questions as a class.


  - Tell students you will choose one of the questions to help you think of a
new ending.


  - Tell students you will now write a new ending to the story, based on the
answer to the question you select.


  - Model writing a new ending on the board/chart paper, talking aloud to model
what you are thinking as you write. Encourage students to offer suggestions.

  - Create the Preview Spellings chart for Introduce the Chapter (Digital
Component 18.1) on the board/chart paper or use the digital version.


  - Gather images for the Core Vocabulary words _feast_ and _joust_ to help
students understand the definitions.


**Start Lesson**


**Lesson 18: Review Verbs**
Language



10M



**Primary Focus:** Students will identify the verbs in oral sentences and will indicate
whether the verbs are in the present or past tense. ~~**TEKS 2.11.D.i; TEKS 2.11.D.ii**~~


Students will decode, spell, and use words with the prefix _dis_ –.


~~**TEKS 2.2.B.vi; TEKS 2.2.C.vi; TEKS 2.3.C**~~


~~**REVIEW PRESENT- AND PAST-TENSE VERBS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students they have learned two types of verbs. Ask students to identify
the names of these verb types. _(action and to be)_ Remind students that an
action verb shows what someone is doing, like _sleep_ or _swim_, and _to_ _be_ verbs
include _are_, _am_, and _is_ in the present tense, and _was_ and _were_ in the past tense.


  - Tell students that today they will review just the present and past tense of
action verbs.


  - Hold up a Wiggle Card and ask the class to read the card and perform the
action. Ask a student to tell you the verb on the card. Ask students if this is
present or past tense.


**Note:** All of the Wiggle Cards are present tense, but the goal is to have
students practice identifying whether they are past or present tense.


**TEKS 2.11.D** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including (i) complete sentences with subject-verb agreement;
(ii) past, present, and future verb tense; **TEKS 2.2.B.vi** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words

and -est (comparative and superlative), and -ion/tion/sion.


Lesson 18 Writing: Plan a Narrative Ending
**203**


**204**




 - Next ask a student to use the Wiggle Card in a complete sentence in the
present tense. Remind students that a complete sentence has both a subject
and a predicate. The subject includes nouns, who or what the sentence is
about, the predicate includes a verb that describes what the subject is or
does. Guide students in adding a subject to the Wiggle Card to create a
complete sentence in the present tense.


 - Then ask another student to tell you the past-tense form of the same verb
and use it in a complete sentence.


 - Repeat with several different Wiggle Cards and students as time permits.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to identify how a present tense verb is generally changed to create the

past-tense and to give an answer that shows what they mean. (You form the past

tense of most verbs by adding _–ed_ to the word. The past tense of the word bang is

_banged_ . “I _banged_ my head on the door.”)


~~**DECODE, SPELL, AND USE WORDS WITH PREFIXES (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students that we can decode, or read, words with prefixes by
segmenting and blending the sounds and using the syllable chunking method.


 - Write the following words on the board/chart paper: _disbelief, disappear._


 - Say, “I see the prefix dis– /d/ /i/ /s/. I am going to segment the rest of the
word: /b/ /ee/ /l/ /ee/ /f/. Now I can blend the entire word: dis•belief.”


 - Pause between the syllables. Underline the _dis_ - in _disbelief_ .


 - Say the word again, clapping if needed to highlight the syllables.


 - Next, explain to students that prefixes change the meaning of the word.
For example, _belief_ becomes disbelief when we add the prefix _dis_ –, which
means “not.” _Disbelief_ means “not believe.”


 - Say, “For words with prefixes, the spelling of the base word does not change
when the prefix is added.”


 - For practice, have small groups use their own paper to repeat the activity
with the word _disappear_ . Offer feedback as needed.

**Primary Focus:** Students will work in pairs to brainstorm alternative endings to
the story “Fire!” ~~**[TEKS 2.11.A]**~~


~~**PLAN A DIFFERENT STORY ENDING (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that in the last lesson they worked as a class to change the
ending of a story. Today they will work with a partner to plan a different
ending to another story.


  - Have students take out Activity Page 18.1. Tell students this is only part of the
story “Fire!” Remind students that in this story, Sir Gus is going to fight a troll
who is living in a cave.


  - As a class, read Activity Page 18.1.


  - Ask students, “How did the story ‘Fire!’ end after this?” _(Sir Gus was so_
_scared that he fainted, his torch lit the ground and cave on fire, the troll ran_
_away to escape the fire, and all the knights thought Sir Gus had been brave.)_


  - Brainstorm one “What if?” question as a class. Briefly, discuss how this
question could lead to a new ending.


  - Pair students with partners and ask them to brainstorm “What if?” questions,
elaborating on the different ending on the back of Activity Page 18.2 with
their partners.


  - Encourage students to try to come up with at least five “What if?” questions,
each of which suggests the possibility of a different ending, with their
partners. Tell students after they record their “What if?” questions on Activity
Page 18.2, they should select and circle one question to use to help write a
new ending to “Fire!”


  - Give students 10 minutes to brainstorm and record ideas, elaborating on
the different ending on the back of Activity Page 18.2. Circulate around the
room to help students think about how their “What if?” questions could lead
to a new ending. If time permits, ask students to share their chosen “What
if?” question with the class. Tell students that tomorrow they will rewrite the
ending to “Fire!” with their partners.

**Primary Focus:** Students will identify verbs in oral sentences as present or past
tense and will identify the vowel sound and spelling in each verb.


~~**TEKS 2.2.B.i; TEKS 2.11.D.ii**~~


Students will decode, spell, and use words with the prefix _dis_ –.


~~**TEKS 2.2.B.vi; TEKS 2.2.C.vi; TEKS 2.3.C**~~


~~**VERB TENSE AND VOWEL CODE REVIEW (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Complete the following oral activity to review present- and past-tense verbs
as well as spellings for selected vowel sounds.


  - Say, “He wiggled his toes,” and ask a student to identify the verb. _(wiggled)_


  - Ask another student to identify the verb as present tense or past tense. _(past)_


  - Once students have correctly identified the verb, repeat the phrase and ask a
student to identify the first vowel sound in the word _wiggled_ . _(/i/)_ Encourage
students to use the Individual Code Chart for extra help.


  - Once the vowel sound has been correctly identified, ask students to point
to the row in the Individual Code Chart showing the spelling or spellings
students have learned for this sound.


  - Ask students to point to the spelling for the sound. Students should be able
to summarize what the class has learned. For example, “We learned to spell
the sound /i/ with the letter ‘i’.”


  - Repeat these steps with the additional sentences below.

**TEKS 2.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (i) decoding words with short, long, or variant vowels, trigraphs, and
blends; (vi) decoding words with prefixes including un-, re-, and dis-, and inflectional endings, including -s, -es, -ed, -ing, -er, and
-est; **TEKS 2.11.D.ii** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including past, present, and future verb tense; **TEKS 2.2.C.vi**
Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by spelling words with prefixes, including un-, re-, and dis-, and inflectional endings,
including -s, -es, -ed, -ing, -er, and -est; **TEKS 2.3.C** identify the meaning of and use words with affixes un-, re-, -ly, -er, and -est
(comparative and superlative), and -ion/tion/sion.

Activity Page 19.1



~~**DECODE, SPELL, AND USE WORDS WITH PREFIXES (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that we can decode, or read, words with prefixes by
segmenting and blending the sounds and using the syllable chunking method.


  - Write the following words on the board/chart paper: _disagree, disloyal._


  - Say, “I see the prefix _dis_  - /d/ /i/ /s/. I am going to segment the rest of the
word: /e/ /g/ /r/ /ee/. Now I can blend the entire word: dis•agree.”


  - Pause between the syllables. Underline the _dis_  - in _disagree_ .


  - Say the word again, clapping if needed to highlight the syllables.


  - Next, explain to students that prefixes change the meaning of the word. For
example, agree becomes _disagree_ when we add the prefix _dis_ –, which means
“not.” _Disagree_ means “not agree.”


  - Say, “For words with prefixes, the spelling of the base word does not change
when the prefix is added.”


  - For practice, have small groups use their own paper to repeat the activity
with the word _disloyal_ . Offer feedback as needed.


**Lesson 19: Grammar**

Language


**Primary Focus:** Students will convert present-tense verbs to the future tense.


~~**TEKS 2.11.D.ii**~~


~~**REVIEW FUTURE-TENSE VERBS (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students they have been studying the present- and past-tense forms
of verbs. Ask students to tell you what it means if something is in the past
tense. _(It is an action that has already happened.)_


  - Ask students to tell you what it means if a verb is in the present tense.
_(The action is happening right now.)_


  - Explain that the future tense is made by adding the word _will_ in front of the
base form of the verb: _I swim_ . > _I will swim_ . The future tense indicates the
action will happen at some time in the future; it is going to happen.


  - Explain that the future tense is much more regular—and much less
complicated—than the past tense.


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 19.1. Work as a class to complete the
chart at the top of the page, changing present-tense verbs to future tense.


**TEKS 2.11.D.ii** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including past, present, and future verb tense.

  - Ask students to respond to the writing prompt by writing a paragraph or a
list of complete sentences describing things they will do when they grow up.
Remind students that they will be writing about something that will happen in
the future so they should consistently use the future tense form of all verbs.


  - If time permits, ask students to share their work, focusing on the future tense
verbs they used.

  - Tell students that today they will be writing the new ending to the story
“Fire!” they planned with a partner.


  - Return Activity Page 18.2 to all students and call to their attention any
suggestions you have made.


  - Tell student partners to talk about the new ending before writing it on
Activity Page 19.2.


  - Tell students that when they finish with their new endings, they should use
the Editing Checklist (Activity Page 19.3) to edit the writing together.


  - To reinforce how to edit drafts for pronoun cases (subjective, objective, and
possessive), explain the differences between them and provide examples:


**TEKS 2.11.C** Revise drafts by adding, deleting, or rearranging words, phrases or sentences; **TEKS 2.11.D** Edit drafts using
standard English conventions, including (x) end punctuation, apostrophes in contractions, and commas with items in a series

and to check for correct use of pronoun cases.


  - Explain to students that a preposition is a word that can help tell where
something is taking place. Words such as _in, out, under, above,_ and so on, are
called prepositions. Prepositions are useful in making simple sentences longer
and more interesting.


  - Remind students that a prepositional phrase is a phrase that begins with a
preposition and is followed by an object (e.g., i _n the cave, on the table, under_
_the rock, above the clouds_ ). A prepositional phrase answers the same question,
_where_, that a preposition answers about something in a sentence.

and will answer written comprehension questions about key details in the text.


~~**TEKS 2.2.B.v; TEKS 2.4; TEKS 2.8.C**~~


~~**INTRODUCE THE CHAPTER (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students the title of today’s story is “The Joust.” The word _joust_ means a
sports contest where knights on horseback fight with lances (long wooden
instruments). Now that you know what _joust_ means, what do you think the
story is about?


  - Tell students they will come across a Tricky Word in the very last sentence of the
story ( _death_ ). Ask students to be extra careful when reading this sentence; they
should use their best word skills to sound out this word. Suggest that they look
at pages 7 and 8 of their Individual Code Chart to sound out this word, as well
as use sentence context to figure out how to pronounce this word. At the end
of the story, tell students you will ask them if they know what the Tricky Word is
and how they used their word skills to figure out the correct pronunciation.


**Preview Spellings**

  - Preview the following spellings before reading today’s story. Remind students
to use what they know about syllable division patterns to read the words. For
example, _nervous_ is a VCCV word that can be read _ner•vous_ .

Lesson 21 Tricky Spelling: Introduce ‘a’ › /a/, /ae/ or /ә/
**225**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**



Today students will work on reading words with the tricky spelling ‘a’. This
spelling poses a problem for readers because it can be pronounced /a/ as
in _hat_, /ae/ as in _paper_, / / as in _about_, or /o/ as in _water_ . The following



in _hat_, /ae/ as in _paper_, / / as in _about_, or /o/ as in _water_ . The following

chart shows /a/ is the most common pronunciation, followed by /



chart shows /a/ is the most common pronunciation, followed by / /, /ae/,

and /o/. When students are faced with an unfamiliar word with the tricky
spelling ‘a’, tell students that the first choice is the /a/ pronunciation, the
second choice is the /ae/ pronunciation, and the third choice is the / / or



second choice is the /ae/ pronunciation, and the third choice is the / / or

schwa (which often sounds like /u/) pronunciation. This pattern will help
students remember the pronunciation options for several spellings, and you
are encouraged to teach the options in the order listed rather than in order of
frequency. The following lesson reflects this order.





**226**



Here are some patterns for your information:


 - ‘ **a** ’ is often pronounced /a/ in one-syllable words ( _cat, hat_ ) and in syllables
where the ‘a’ is boxed in by consonant spellings ( _captain, factor_ ).


 - ‘ **a** ’ is almost always pronounced /a/ when it is followed by a double-letter
spelling for a consonant sound ( _batter, abbey, sassy_ ). The double-letter
spelling is a marker for the “short” pronunciation of the preceding vowel.
However, an ‘a’ before ‘ll’ can be pronounced /a/ ( _rally, tally_ ) or /aw/ ( _all, hall_ ).


 - ‘ **a** ’ is likely to be pronounced /o/ when preceded by a spelling for /w/
( _watch, water_ ).


Foundational Skills 5


  - ‘ **a** ’ is likely to be pronounced /ae/ ( _paper, cradle_ ) when it is at the end of the
first syllable in a multisyllable word.


  - ‘ **a** ’ is likely to be pronounced as either /ә/ ( _about, along_ ) or /a/ ( _apple, at_ )
when found in the initial position.


  - ‘ **a** ’ is almost always pronounced /ә/ when found in the final position ( _Africa,_
_Asia, America, Laura_ ).


  - ‘ **a** ’ is also part of many multi-letter spellings (e.g., ‘ay’, ‘ai’, ‘a_e’, ‘ea’).

Lesson 22 Tricky Spelling: Introduce ‘e’ › /e/, /ee/, or /ә/
**235**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today students will work on reading words with the tricky spelling ‘e’. This
spelling poses a challenge for readers, because it is regularly pronounced
three different ways: /e/ as in _pet_, /ee/ as in _me_, and /ә/ as in _debate_ . The
bar chart shows /e/ is the most common pronunciation for ‘e’, and /ee/ is
more common than schwa.




|Spelling|1st Choice—Short|2nd Choice—Long|3rd Choice—/ /.|
|---|---|---|---|
|‘a’|/a/ (short) as in_hat_|/ae/ (long) as in<br>_cake_|/ / as in_about_|
|‘e’|/e/ (short) as in_pet_|/ee/ (long) as in_me_|/ / as in_debate_|



**236**



If students come across an unfamiliar printed word containing the letter ‘e’,
they should try pronouncing the ‘e’ as /e/. If that does not sound like a word,
or if the resulting word does not make sense in context, students should try
/ee/ (the “long” pronunciation). If that still sounds wrong, they should try
/ә/. This pattern is consistent with the pattern identified in the previous
lesson and presented in the following chart.


Here are some patterns for your information:


 - ‘ **e** ’ is almost always pronounced /e/ in one-syllable words. The only
exceptions are a handful of high-frequency, one-syllable words that
have the final ‘ **e** ’ pronounced /ee/: _he, she, we, be, me_ .


Foundational Skills 5


  - ‘ **e** ’ is almost always pronounced /e/ when it appears before a double-letter
spelling for a consonant sound ( _Betty, bedding, dresser_ ). The double-letter
spelling is a marker for the “short” pronunciation of the preceding vowel.


  - ‘ **e** ’ is pronounced /ee/ primarily in words beginning with one of four common
prefixes: _be–, de–, pre–_, and _re_ –. These four prefixes account for about twothirds of the words in which ‘ **e** ’ is pronounced /ee/.


  - ‘ **e** ’ is much more likely to be pronounced /e/ at the beginning of the word
_everyone_, rather than /ee/ ( _evaporate_ ) or / / ( _eruption_ ).


  - At the end of a word, ‘ **e** ’ usually forms part of a separated digraph ( _cake,_
_bike, note_ ); the pronunciations /e/ and / / almost never occur at the end of
a word. There are a few words having the final ‘ **e** ’ pronounced /ee/ ( _maybe,_
_acne, adobe, coyote_ ).


  - ‘ **e** ’ is most commonly pronounced as / /in the middle of a word, rather than
at the beginning or end.


**Foundational Skills**

  - Write the following words on individual cards (the text should be large
enough that students can read the words from their desks): _young, southern,_
_apple, China, fossil, mental, eagle, tunnel, portion, reaction, needle_ .

 - Point out that ‘e’ is a spelling for /e/, /ee/, and / /.


 - Remind students that when a spelling can be pronounced more than one
way, we call it a tricky spelling.


 - Tell students that when they see an unfamiliar word with the ‘e’ spelling,
they should first try pronouncing the ‘e’ as /e/; if that does not sound right

Foundational Skills 5


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today students will work on reading words with the tricky spelling ‘o’. This
spelling poses a challenge for readers because it is regularly pronounced
three different ways. At this point, students have been introduced to all three
of the most common pronunciations: /o/ as in _hop_, /oe/ as in _open_, and /u/
as in _son_ . The chart shows /o/ is the most common pronunciation for ‘o’, but
/oe/ and /u/ are also quite common.


Here are some patterns for your information:


  - ‘ **o** ’ is usually pronounced /o/ in one-syllable words, especially in words where
the ‘ **o** ’ is boxed in on either side by consonant spellings ( _hot, box, top, dog_ );
however, there are some exceptions ( _gold, post, bold, son_ ).


  - ‘ **o** ’ is almost always pronounced /o/ when it is followed by a double-letter
spelling for a consonant sound ( _knotty, hobby, bossy_ ).


  - ‘ **o** ’ is rarely pronounced /u/ in one-syllable words. There are only a handful
of such words in our database of 25,000 words ( _front, monk, month, son,_
_sponge, ton, tongue, won_ ).


  - At the beginning of a word, /oe/ ( _obey_ ) is more likely than /o/ ( _offer_ ).
The least likely pronunciation is /u/ ( _other_ ).


  - At the end of a word, or at the end of a syllable, ‘ **o** ’ is likely to be pronounced
/oe/ ( _hobo, hero, echo_ ). Both /o/ and /u/ are very rare in such cases.


Lesson 23 Tricky Spelling: Introduce‘o’ › /o/, /oe/, or /u/
**245**


**246**




  - ‘ **o** ’ is also pronounced /oo/ in a handful of words like _to, do_, and _movie_, but
this pronouncing option appears less than 1% of the time, and this program
does not explicitly teach it.


  - ‘ **o** ’ is also part of many multi-letter spellings for vowel sounds (e.g., ‘oe’, ‘ou’,
‘oi’, ‘oy’, ‘ow’, ‘or’, ‘o_e’).

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today students will work on reading words with the tricky spelling ‘o_e’.
This spelling poses a challenge for readers because it is pronounced several
different ways. At this point, students have been introduced the two most
common pronunciations, /oe/ and /u/. The chart shows /oe/ is more
common than /u/. /u/, however, is relatively rare. If students come across
an unfamiliar printed word containing the spelling ‘o_e’, they should try
pronouncing the ‘o_e’ as /oe/. If that does not sound like a word, or if the
resulting word does not make sense in context, students should try /u/.


Here are some patterns for your information:


  - /oe/ is the most common pronunciation.


  - /oo/ is rare; it is used in _lose_ and a series of words ending with /v/ ( _prove_,
_move_, _disprove_, _approve_, _remove_ ).


  - The sound/spelling ‘ **o_e** ’ also occur in words like _more_ and _sore_, where they
are part of a spelling for /or/.


  - They also appear in words where the ‘o’ and the ‘e’ are part of two separate
graphemes (e.g., _lover_, _money_, _however_ ). Examples of these two usages make
up most of the remaining 42% shown in the chart.

Remind students that when a spelling can be pronounced more than one
way, we call it a tricky spelling.




 - Tell students that when they see an unfamiliar word with the ‘o_e’ spelling,
they should try pronouncing the ‘o_e’ as /oe/. If that does not sound right,
or does not make sense in context, they should try /u/.


 - Read the words on display aloud as a class, focusing on the ‘o_e’ spelling.
Have students tell you if it stands for the /u/ or /oe/ sound.

groups should also discuss what they think the correct response is.


- The first group should then announce which words are the subject and which

or disagree, announcing their decision by saying, “Agree” or “Challenge.”
Any group that “challenges” must indicate the correct subject and predicate.

Note to Teacher


Today students will work on reading words with the tricky spelling ‘ou’. This
spelling poses a challenge for readers because it can be pronounced several
different ways. At this point, students have been introduced to the two
most common pronunciations, /ou/ and /u/. The chart shows /ou/ is the
most common pronunciation, followed by /u/. It also shows two additional
pronunciation options, /oo/ and /oe/. These, however, are quite rare so they
are not explicitly taught. If students come across an unfamiliar printed word
containing the spelling ‘ou’, they should try pronouncing the ‘ou’ as /ou/. If
that does not sound like a word, or if the resulting word does not make sense
in context, students should try /u/.


Here is some additional information:


  - At the beginning of a word, ‘ **ou** ’ is almost always pronounced /ou/.

Today you will administer the first two Unit 5 assessments. The first assessment
is a Reading Comprehension Assessment that targets students’ ability to
independently decode and understand a story. The second assessment is a
Grammar Assessment that targets punctuation and capitalization, plural nouns,
parts of speech, subject and predicate, and verb tense.


Prepare the Reading Comprehension Assessment Record Sheet and the
Grammar Assessment Record Sheet, found in Teacher Resources, prior to
administering the assessments.


**Language**

 - Write the following words on index cards for Review Alphabetizing. If you still
have the spelling cards from the previous week, pull the asterisked words

from this card set rather than rewrite them.

**Scoring and Analysis**

 - When scoring this assessment, please note assessment item number 8 has
four sentences. Each of these sentences is worth one point. All of the other
items (numbers 1–7) are worth one point each.


 - Record student scores on the Reading Comprehension Assessment Record
Sheet located in Teacher Resources.


 - A score of less than 8 correct out of 11 should prompt additional testing. In
Lessons 28–30 you will work one-on-one with students to have them read
the story aloud to you and answer the questions orally to determine if their
original performance reflects poor decoding skills, a lack of comprehension,
or perhaps instead is the result of rushing to finish the assessment.


 - Additionally, any student who scores less than 8 out of 11 correct and does
not perform better on the one-on-one assessment should also take the
Individual Decoding Assessment and the Individual High-Frequency Word
Assessment in Lessons 28–30.

performance to determine whether remediation is needed. Some students
who perform poorly on the Grammar Assessment may also perform
poorly on other unit assessments, such as the Decoding Assessment
and/or Reading Comprehension Assessments. For these students, if the
available time for remediation is limited, providing additional decoding and
comprehension practice is a priority.


**Part 1**


A score of less than 15 correct out of 20 points on the **Punctuation and**
**Capitalization** section (numbers 1–7) on Activity Page 26.2 indicates that the
student needs additional practice in correcting punctuation and capitalization
errors. Analyze errors to determine if specific types of punctuation and
capitalization are problematic.


**Part 2**

 - A score of less than 4 correct out of 5 points on the **Plurals** section (numbers
8–12) on Activity Page 26.2 indicates that the student may need additional
practice in creating the plural forms of nouns. Analyze errors to determine
if you need to review specific rules about plural formation or whether
additional practice with irregular plural formation is indicated.


**Part 3**

 - A score of less than 12 correct out of 15 points on the **Parts of Speech**
section (numbers 13–17) on the back of Activity Page 26.2 indicates that the
student may need additional practice with the parts of speech. Examine the
errors for patterns to determine if adjectives, nouns, or verbs are the area
of confusion.


**Part 4**

 - A score of less than 7 correct out of 10 points on the **Subject and**
**Predicate** section (numbers 18–22) on the back of Activity Page 26.2
indicates additional practice is needed. Examine the error pattern to
see whether subjects or predicates individually need attention or both
concepts need review.


**Part 5**

 - A score of less than 7 correct out of 10 points on the **Verb Tense** section
(numbers 23–32) on Activity Page 26.3 needs to be examined. Again, look
to see if it is one single tense causing the confusion or if it appears to be
all three.

**REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT**
##### Individual Assessments and Review Activities


Note to Teacher


For the next three days, lessons will include a combination of individually
administered assessments and review activities. _Administer the assessments_
_to struggling students only, as a way to identify targeted remediation needs._


The individualized assessments that you may administer are dependent on
student scores:


  - Oral Reading Comprehension Assessment (See Reading Comprehension
Assessment Record Sheet)


  - Individual Decoding Assessment (See Decoding Assessment Record Sheet)


  - High-Frequency Word Assessment


The program teaches Tricky Words, focusing on the parts of the word that
are decodable and _not decodable_ . However, many states and school districts
conduct explicit assessments of students’ reading accuracy of words from
various popular high-frequency sight word lists. An assessment of words
from the Dolch Sight Word List is included here. Many of these words have
been taught as Tricky Words in the program; others are decodable.


**Cursive Writing Assessment** ~~**TEKS 2.2.E**~~


You will assess students’ progress with the cursive skills taught during this
unit by administering a cursive writing assessment. Students will complete
this independently while other reading assessments are taking place
throughout the three-day assessment period.


**Lessons 28–30**

  - You will select pages from the Pausing Point for all other students to
complete on all three days. A lesson plan follows that offers a way to
structure the assessments and Pausing Point activities.


**TEKS 2.2.E** Develop handwriting by accurately forming all cursive letters using appropriate strokes when connecting letters.

**293**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


         - Thoroughly review the instructions for the administration and scoring of all
individually administered assessments that follow.


          - Choose sufficient Pausing Point activities, targeted to meet the needs of each
student, for each day. Keep in mind that other students will need to work without
your supervision as you give the individually administered assessments.


         - You may wish to plan for and set up other centers and acitivites for students
to complete, such as a listening center or reading trade books.


         - The following is a chart outlining a suggested lesson plan to structure the
assessments and Pausing Point activities.

Pausing Point


**Note to Teacher**


This is the end of Unit 5. If it appears students are having difficulty, you may
wish to pause here and spend 4 or 5 days reviewing the material taught in
Unit 5 and/or make arrangements to work with specific students individually
or in small groups in order to address specific problems.


You should pause if several students are having trouble reading words
containing the spelling alternatives taught in this unit. However, there is no
need to pause if the difficulty is evident only when students are trying to use
the correct spelling alternative when writing. Spelling accuracy will come
gradually, with time and lots of exposure to printed materials.


Group students who are having similar difficulties, and teach these students
in small groups. For example, you might have one group that needs more
practice reading Tricky Words and another group that needs more practice
reading words with spellings for /u/.

Note to Teacher


Although practice activity pages and activities are provided for your use
in the Pausing Point, the most important goal for remediation is to have
students internalize the process of decoding tricky spellings through
teacher-directed instruction, not just completing an activity page.


For all of these tricky spelling activity pages, the most important first step to
every activity page is for the teacher to follow these instructions:


1. Point out each possible sound with several example words.


2. Orally review with students all of the possible sounds for the given spelling,
almost like a “chant”:

   - ‘a’ = /a/, /ae/, /ə/, /o/


  - ‘e’= /e/, /ee/, /ə/


   - ‘o’ = /o/, /oe/, /u/


  - ‘o_e’ = /oe/, /u/


3. Then write a completely unfamiliar word on the board with the target spelling
and verbally model trying out the possible sounds in decoding the word.
Refer to the Additional Support section of the various lessons for additional
word lists and phrases.


4. Then write additional unfamiliar words on the board, prompting students to
attempt each sound systematically. Only then should students proceed to
the actual activity page.


~~**TRICKY SPELLING ‘A’**~~


**Tricky Spelling ‘a’**

 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page PP.1. Work with students to identify the

own row (e.g., there is one row for ‘u’, one row for ‘o’, one row for ‘o_e’).

  - When the cards have been sorted, have the student say the sound for
each spelling.

  - Ask the student if there are any rows that have multiple cards. (There should
be four cards in the row for ‘a’, three cards in the row for ‘o’, three cards in
the row for ‘e’, two cards in the row for ‘o_e’, two cards in the row for ‘ou’, and
three cards in the row for ‘ea’.)

~~**SORT WORDS BY SOUND/SPELLING**~~


**Board Sort**

 - Select ten to twenty /u/ words from the following box. Write the words on the
board in alphabetical order or random order.


 - Pass out lined paper.


 - Ask students to sort the words into columns based on which spelling is used
to stand for the /u/ sound. (If possible, display the sort.)


**Note** : If students need additional scaffolding, you can underline the target
spelling in each word. The same kind of sort can also be done for the schwa
sound and the sound combination /ә/ + /l/.


**Words for /u/**

ugly, slump, unkind, sudden, funny, lunchbox, puppy, sunrise, uncle, muffin, other, person,
money, second, nothing, front, reason, period, month, complete, lovely, none, handsome,
gloves, shove, welcome, doves, some, young, country, various, famous, serious, touch,
southern, dangerous, enormous, nervous

**Words for /** **ə** **/**

about, around, away, important, along, across, Africa, among, ago, probably, amount,
finally, alone, thousand, molecule, benefit, deposit, severe, telescope, categories, decay,
deciding, necessity, genetic, debate, cement, ceremony, strategy, Tennessee

**Words for /** **ə** **/** **+** **/l/**

final, April, pencil, evil, nostrils, level, travel, model, vessel, tunnel, label, channel, barrel, novel,
camel, little, able, possible, table, middle, simple, single, trouble, available, uncle


**Word Sort with Pocket Chart**

 - Set up a pocket chart so it has a header for each of the spellings students
have learned for /u/.


 - Write ten to twenty decodable words containing the spellings for /u/ on index
cards.


 - Ask students to sort the words by placing them on the pocket chart under
the proper headers.


**Note** : If students need additional scaffolding, you can underline the target
spelling in each word, or have students do this as a preliminary step.


Foundational Skills 5


  - Other Options: Set up two or more identical pocket charts, divide the class
into groups, and have the groups do the word sort as a race.


**Note** : This exercise can also be done for the /ә / sound or the sound
combination /ә / + /l/. Use any of the words listed under Board Sort or
select your own decodable words.


**Cut-and-Paste Word Sort**

  - Print decodable /u/ words on slips of paper.


  - Cut the slips apart and put them into several boxes or cups.


  - Give students sheets of blank paper and ask them to make headings for each
spelling they have learned for /u/ (‘u’, ‘o’, ‘o_e’, ‘ou’). (If you think this might be
too difficult, you can make a page with the columns pre-labeled.)


  - Ask students to pick a single word from one of the cups and write it in a
column according to which spelling for /u/ is used.


  - Have students pick more words and write them in the sorting space.


**Note** : If students need additional scaffolding, you can underline the target
spelling in each word.


  - **Additional Activity:** Have students use highlighters to mark the letters that
spell the /u/ sound in each word on their sorting space.


**Note** : This exercise can also be done for the /ә / sound or the sound
combination /ә l/. Use the words listed under Board Sort or select your own
decodable words.


**Show and Tell**

  - The day before teaching this exercise, ask students to bring in objects or
pictures of objects with names containing the /u/ or the /ә / sound (e.g., a
cup, money, a balloon, gloves, etc.).


  - Ask each student to show and name his or her object.


  - Write the name of the object on the board.


  - Ask students which letter or letters stand for the /u/ or /ә / sound.


  - Make a heading for a column of words containing this spelling for /u/ or /ә /.


  - Invite a student to copy his or her word under the heading.


Pausing Points
**315**


**316**




 - Continue collecting /u/ and /ә / words, writing them on the board and
sorting them by spelling (e.g., all ‘u’ words under a ‘u’ heading, all ‘o’ words
under an ‘o’ heading, all ‘a’ words under an ‘a’ heading, all untaught /u/ and
/ә/ spellings under an odd ducks heading).


**Note** : Most of the words you will be writing will have /u/ or /ә / spelled with
one of the spelling alternatives taught in this unit, but they may also contain
other spellings students do not know yet. You should be prepared to explain
any bits that are beyond students’ current code knowledge. This exercise can
also be done for the sound combination /ә / + /l/.


**Spelling Alternatives Board Game**

 - Create a game board with twenty-five to forty spaces and several crossing
paths so students can move in several different directions.


 - Write a decodable /u/ word on each square, making sure to include several
examples of each of the spelling patterns taught.


 - Give each student a scorecard listing the spellings for /u/ they have learned
(‘u’, ‘o’, ‘o_e’, ‘ou’), with spaces to collect a word exemplifying each spelling.


 - Teach students to play the game by rolling a die (or spinning a spinner) and
moving their game piece the correct number of spaces.


 - When students land on a space, they should read the word and copy it onto
their spelling scorecard according to the spelling used for the /u/ sound. For
example, the word young would be copied into the space for ‘ou’ words.


 - The first student to get one example of each spelling pattern wins.


**Note** : This game can be played with the /ә / + /l/ sound combination.


**Word Sort with Pocket Chart**

 - Set up a pocket chart so it has a header labeled _1_ for one-syllable words another
labeled _2_ for two-syllable words, and a third labeled _3_ for three-syllable words.


 - Write a number of decodable words on cards.


 - Remind students that a one-syllable word has one vowel sound, a twosyllable word has two vowel sounds, etc.


 - Ask students to sort the words by placing them on the pocket chart under
the proper headers.


 - Alternatively, set up two or more identical pocket charts, divide the class into
groups, and have the groups do the word sort as a race.


Foundational Skills 5


**Card Sort**

  - Write a set of decodable words on index cards.


  - Have students sort the cards into columns based on syllable count.


**Note** : This activity is suitable for workstations.


**Code Flip Book Review**

  - Say a vowel sound, and ask students to point to and identify the spellings
they have learned for that sound.


  - Ask students which sounds have the most spelling alternatives.


  - Explain that these are the sounds that tend to be hard to spell.


  - You can review consonant sounds as well.


**Sound-to-Spelling Card Game**

  - Give a student all of the Spelling Cards for /u/, /o/, /oe/, and /ou/.


  - Ask the student to sort the cards by sound, so that each sound has its own
row (e.g., there is one row for /u/, one row for /o/).


  - When the cards have been sorted, have the student list the spellings for
each sound.


  - Ask the student which sounds have more spellings.


  - Explain that sounds having a lot of spellings are generally harder to spell than
sounds having only a few.


  - Ask the student which spellings are shared by two or more sounds. Explain
that these are the tricky spellings that can be pronounced different ways.


**Note** : This is a good game for one-on-one tutorial work or workstations.

**Choose the Right Word**

 - Write the words _Kentucky, money,_ and _young_ on the board and read them
to students.


 - Tell students you are going to ask them some questions. They can find the
answers on the board.


 - Ask students, “Which word names something we use to pay for things?”


 - Tell students to find the answer _(money)_ on the board and then copy it onto a
sheet of paper.


 - Continue this process with the remaining questions that follow, introducing
the words in groups of three as you go.


1a. Which word is an antonym of _old_ ? _(young)_


1b. Which word names a state? _(Kentucky)_


1c. Which word names something we use to pay for things? _(money)_

~~**SPELL WORDS**~~


**Pocket Chart Chaining for Spelling**

  - Set up a pocket chart.


  - Choose a chain of words for students to spell.


  - Add Letter Cards for the spellings students will need for the pocket chart.
(Multi-letter spellings should appear on single cards, not multiple cards.)


  - Arrange vowel Letter Cards along the top of the pocket chart.


  - Arrange consonant spellings along the bottom.


  - Review the spellings by pointing to the cards and asking for the sounds they
stand for. (For tricky spellings, ask for all pronunciations students have learned.)


  - Say the word _not._


  - Ask the class for the first sound in _not._


  - Select a student to come to the pocket chart, identify the spelling for /n/,
and move it to the middle of the pocket chart.


  - Ask the class for the second sound in _not._


  - Select a student to come to the pocket chart, identify the spelling for /o/,
and move it to the middle of the pocket chart.


  - Ask the class for the third sound in _not._


  - Select a student to come to the pocket chart, identify the spelling for /t/, and
move it to the middle of the pocket chart.


  - Once the word has been spelled, read it to check that it has been
spelled correctly.


  - Say, “If that is _not_ who can show me _got?_ ”


  - Work through the remaining words in the chain.


  - You can make this exercise harder by putting more spelling alternatives for
particular sounds on the pocket chart; you can make it easier by putting
fewer spellings on the chart.


  - If multiple spellings for a sound are displayed on the pocket chart, you should
adjust your phrasing and ask questions like, “Does anyone know how the /e/
sound is spelled in this word?” or “Does anyone know which of the spellings
for /e/ we need to spell this word?”

**Guess My Word**

  - Set up a pocket chart.


  - Arrange Spelling Cards for a number of vowel spellings (including recently
taught spellings) along the top of the pocket chart.


  - Arrange Spelling Cards for a number of consonant spellings along the
bottom of the pocket chart.


  - Think of a decodable word you can build using the spellings shown, but do
not tell the class your word.


  - Tell students how many sounds are in your word.


  - Invite students to try to guess the word by asking whether or not it contains
specific sounds and/or spellings.


  - If students identify a spelling in the word, move that spelling to the middle of
the pocket chart.


  - Continue until the word has been spelled in the center of the pocket chart.


  - Repeat with one or two additional words.


~~**WRITE WORDS**~~


**Board Chaining**


**Note** : For easier chains, use the chains listed under Pocket Chart Chaining
for Spelling. For more challenging chains, use the chains listed under Teacher
Chaining, which contain newly taught spellings.


  - Write the word _not_ on the board.


  - Have the class read the word.


  - Say to the class, “If this is _not_, which letter do I need to change in order to
make _got?_ Who can show me?” (Select a student to come to the board and
point to the letter.)


  - Say to the class, “Who thinks they know the spelling that we need instead of
the letter ‘n’?” (Select a student to come to the board and change ‘n’ to ‘g’.)


  - Ask the class, “Did we get it right?”


  - Repeat this process with the remaining words.

**Chaining Dictation**

 - Have students take out a pencil and a piece of paper.


 - Tell students you are going to say a number of words.


 - Explain that each new word will be very similar to the previous word, but one
sound will be different (e.g., _got_ might be changed to _pot_ ).


 - Tell students to write each word that you say.


 - As you move from one word to the next, use the chaining phrase, “If that is
_got,_ show me _pot._ ”


 - If you choose harder words, you may wish to do this exercise cooperatively,
offering feedback and opportunities to self-correct as you make your way
through the items, rather than presenting the items in a test-like format
where no feedback is given until you return the written work to students.


**Targeted Dictation**

 - Choose one of the sets of words outlined in the following boxes.


 - Tell students to take out a pencil and a piece of paper.


 - Explain that you are going to say ten words that will all follow a certain pattern.


 - Explain the pattern for the words you have chosen.


 - Tell students to write each word that you say.


**Note** : You may wish to do this exercise cooperatively, offering feedback as
you make your way through the items, rather than presenting it in a testlike format where no feedback is given until you return the students’ written
work. One way to do this is to write each word on the board and allow the
students to self-correct before moving on to the next word.

~~**LESSON 5: SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


**Unit 5, Lesson 5**

  - Students are likely to make the error of spelling the sound /ee/ with an ‘e’ as opposed to the letter ‘y’.
Additional practice has been provided in the Pausing Point pages for this lesson.


  - The second most likely error may be one of incorrectly alphabetizing the words on the back of the
spelling assessment. Additional instruction will be given with this skill as the unit progresses.


  - Although any of the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should still be aware that
misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find it helpful to record the actual spelling
errors the student makes in the analysis chart.


For example:


    - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


    - Is the student consistently making errors on double consonants?


    - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


    - Is the student consistently making errors on particular beginning consonants?


Teacher Resources
**331**


~~**LESSON 5: ANALYSIS OF STUDENT ERRORS**~~


~~**LESSON 10: SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


  - The most common error that you can expect with these words is the confusion of the spellings of
/ie/. Additional practice can be found in the Pausing Point.


  - While the above scenario may be true for student errors, be aware that student misspellings may be
due to many other errors. You may find it helpful to record the actual misspelling errors the student
makes in the analysis chart. For example:


    - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


    - Is the student consistently making errors on double consonants?


    - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


    - Is the student consistently making errors on particular beginning consonants?

~~**LESSON 15: SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


**Unit 5 Lesson 15**

  - As all of these words contain the spelling ‘ie’ for /ee/, student errors are most likely to include
spelling the ‘ie’ as ‘ee’. Additional practice for this sound/spelling correspondence may be found in
the Pausing Point.


  - Although the above scenario may be true for student errors, be alert for student misspellings due
to many other errors. You may find it helpful to record the actual misspelling errors that the student
makes in the analysis chart.
For example:


    - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


    - Is the student consistently making errors on double consonants?

~~**LESSON 20: SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


**Unit 5, Lesson 20**

  - Students who missed number(s) 1 and/or 12 may need review of the ‘y’ as a spelling for /ee/.


  - Students who missed number(s) 4, 9, 10, and/or 13 may need review of the ‘y’ as a spelling for /ie/.


  - Students who missed number(s) 3, 8, and/or 14 may need review of the ‘y’ as a spelling for /i/.


  - Students who missed number(s) 2, 5, 6, 7, and/or 11 may need review of the ‘y’ as a spelling for /y/.


  - While any of the above scenarios may be true for student errors, be aware that student misspellings
may be due to many other errors. You may find it helpful to record the actual misspelling errors that
the student makes in the analysis chart. For example:


    - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


    - Is the student consistently making errors on double consonants?


    - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


    - Is the student consistently making errors on particular beginning consonants?


    - Please look back at Unit 4 for exercises (Pausing Point and activity pages) targeting tricky spelling ‘y’.


    - Students may have had difficulty alphabetizing the words; there are activities in the Pausing Point
targeting this skill.

  - Students are most likely to reverse the order of the ‘le’ and ‘el’ spellings in this list of words, as well as
spell ‘tion’ as ‘shun.’ Additional activity pages may be found in the Pausing Point addressing this.

**Marching Orders**


_The next morning, the knight known as Sir Doug arrived at the_
_palace. He found Sir Gus in the king’s kitchen cooking eggs and bacon._

_“Good morning!” said a cheery Sir Gus._

_“Sir Gus,” cried Sir Doug, “Sir Tom and Sir Ed need your help!”_

_“They do?” said Sir Gus, who was beginning to suspect that there_
_would be no time to eat breakfast._

_“Yes!” replied Sir Doug. “Their sudden night attack in the Fields of_
_the West did not go well. They were engaged in fierce fighting with the_
_Black Knight. They have battled all night. They sent me to beg you to_
_come with the rest of the army and save them! Sir Gus, the rest of the_
_army is awaiting your command.”_

_“Yes, indeed, my command,” replied Sir Gus, knowing that he must_
_go at once. “Go and saddle the horses! We will ride at once!”_

_A little while later, Sir Gus appeared in front of the king’s palace. He_
_was dressed for battle and holding the map Sir Tom had given him._

_“My friends,” Sir Gus announced, “we will ride south, until we get_
_to the Old Stone Bridge. Then we will use the bridge to cross the Misty_
_River and enter King Henry’s kingdom.”_

_Sir Doug and the rest of the men looked puzzled._

_“But, Sir Gus,” said Sir Doug, “the Old Stone Bridge is north of here,_
_not south.”_

_“Is it?” said Sir Gus. “Then we will ride north.”_

_“Very well,” said Sir Doug. “But, if you don’t mind my asking, Sir_
_Gus, why should we ride all the way up to the Old Stone Bridge? That_
_will take us ten miles away from the fighting. Sir Ed and Sir Tom need_
_us. Would it not be better to take the quickest way? The battle is just west_
_of here. If we ride west to the river, we can dismount and walk our horses_
_across the river.”_

_“It is too dangerous,” Sir Gus said._

_What Sir Gus did not tell them was that he did not know how to_
_swim and was frightened to cross the river on foot._

_And that was the real reason why Sir Gus and his men rode north._

Appendix A: More About
Schwa (/ /)


In order to teach the concept of /ә/ well, you will need to first understand it yourself.


English words with more than one syllable usually include a combination of stressed and unstressed
syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed or weakly stressed, its vowel sound is often
reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound linguists call schwa (/ә/). This happens in many
English words. More than 3,000 of the 25,000 words in our database (about 13%) have at least one
syllable in which the vowel sound is reduced to /ә/.


The exact pronunciation of /ә/ varies somewhat from word to word and also from region to region.
In many words, and in many parts of the United States, /ә/ sounds very much like the sound /u/.
For example, in the word _about_, the unstressed /ә/ sound in the first syllable sounds a great deal
like /u/. In the word _America_, both the first and the last vowel sounds are unstressed, and both
sound a great deal like /u/. In some regions of the United States, many speakers use an /u/-like /ә/
sound in words such as _along, balloon, debate, benefit,_ and _telephone_ .


However, for certain words, and/or for speakers in certain parts of the country, /ә/ may sound a
little more like /i/. How do people in your region pronounce the word _benefit_ ? Do they pronounce
the second vowel sound more like /u/ or /i/? What about _telephone_ ? Do people where you live in
Texas say /t/ /e/ /l/ /u/ /f/ /oe/ /n/? Or does the spoken word sound more like /t/ /e/ /l/ /i/ /f/
/oe/ /n/? What about _debate_ ? Does the local pronunciation sound more like /d/ /u/ /b/ /ae/ /t/ or
/d/ /i/ /b/ /ae/ /t/? Neither pronunciation is more correct than the other. These are all examples
of natural variation or dialect. All of these examples contain a reduction to /ә/.


Appendix A
**419**


**420**



**Schwa (/** **ə** **/) and /u/**

Because /ә/ is similar to /u/ in so many words, we have chosen to address it along with the
/u/ sound in this unit. We have also grouped /ә/ and /u/ together for the statistics on spellings
and pronunciation. Therefore, /ә/ is treated as a variant of the /u/ sound. This is a slight
oversimplification, because /ә/ occasionally sounds more like /i/. But this is a reasonable strategy
for dealing with an inherently messy situation.


The dividing line between words containing spelling alternatives for /u/ and words containing
reductions to /ә/ is sometimes hard to define. Words like _double, trouble, cousin_, and _touch_ should
be seen as containing the ‘ou’ spelling for /u/. In all of these words, the initial vowel sound /u/ is
stressed. But the situation becomes more complex with words like _famous_ and _nervous_ . In these
words, the last syllable is unstressed. So one might say these words contain the ‘ou’ spelling for
/u/, or one might say they contain an unstressed syllable in which the reduction to /ә/ sounds a
lot like /u/ in most dialects (but could sound more like /i/ in some). Both positions are defensible.
However, for purposes of classification words of this sort are viewed as examples of the ‘ou’ spelling
alternative for /u/ as opposed to examples of /ә/.


The same principle is applied to the classification of words with the ‘o’ and ‘o_e’ spellings. Not only
_mother_ and _brother_ (stressed) but also _button_ and _bacon_ (unstressed) are classified as examples
of /u/ spelled with the spelling alternative ‘o’. Some might prefer to view the last two words as
examples of reductions to /ә/. Likewise, not only _glove_ and _some_ (stressed) but also _awesome_ and
_gruesome_ (unstressed) are classified as examples of the ‘o_e’ spelling for /u/. Again, some might
view the last two as reductions to /ә/. But, is the second vowel sound in _awesome_ really a different
sound from the vowel sound in _some_ ? In practice it makes little difference whether these spellings
are viewed as spelling alternatives for /u/ or as spellings for /ә/, because spelling alternatives for
/u/ are introduced first and reductions to /ә/ just a few lessons later.

Appendix B: Using
Chunking to Decode
Multisyllable Words


Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught in the program will enable students to
read one-syllable words with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences
is no guarantee that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllable words. To
this end, most students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk and
read parts of words—syllables—as a way to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can then
be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated and students are expected
to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, this program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the easiest
two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is already a
familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In addition, each
syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing_, _hunt·er_, _bust·ed_ ).
The dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain doubleletter spellings for consonants, in this progam, the divider is typically placed after the double-letter
spelling rather than between the two consonants (e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers familiar
with other ways to chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is done, however,
because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single-spelling units in this program since
Kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.). This program strives to be consistent in
representing these spellings in the way that the students have been taught to process them (e.g.,
as whole entities for a sound). (Ultimately, as students become more proficient at decoding and
chunking syllables through subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually
chunk and decode these words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding
these two-syllable words consisting of root words and suffixes relatively easy.


Appendix B
**421**


**422**



A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable words.
To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


 - **Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound**
**(e.g., /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/):** _let,_ _pad,_ _rod,_ _tin,_ _fun,_ _pic·nic,_ _un·til_


 - **Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/,**
**/ie/, /oe/, /ue/):** _cake,_ _home,_ _like,_ _mule,_ _Pete, mis·take, stam·pede_


 - **Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint,_ _speak,_ _proud,_ _play, dis·may, be·low,_ _coun·sel_


 - **R-Controlled Syllables:** _art,_ _curb,_ _girl,_ _fort,_ _clerk,_ _tur·nip, ar·tist, fe·ver_


 - **Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /ie/,**
**/oe/, /ue/):** _go,_ _me,_ _hi,_ _a·pron, f·nal, com·pre·hend_


 - **Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple, puz·zle, raf·fe, ca·ble, ri·fe_


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


 - **Schwa Syllables:** _ben·e·fit, ap·pe·tite, a·bout, hos·pit·al,_ _e·mo·tion_


**Note:** The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately because
of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


**To be clear, in order to decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these**
**names. The names of the syllable types are provided here only to establish a common**
**vocabulary for teachers as they use the materials.** What is necessary, however, for students
to become fluent readers of longer words in increasingly complex text is that they be able to
visually parse certain spelling patterns as syllable chunks so they can quickly and easily decode
each syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in Kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


 - When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.


_ad · mit_ _nap · kin_ _trum · pet_


Foundational Skills 5


  - For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed after the
double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is one because the
double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units in this program since Kindergarten
(‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).


_traff · ic_ _muff · in_ _happ · en_


  - When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.


_mon · ster_ _con · tract_ _pil · grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read
the first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model
for students how to blend the two syllables aloud:


In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the magic
‘e’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


  - Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for closed
syllables:


_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


In Grade 2, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to use
a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying each
possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


Appendix B
**423**


**424**




 - When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:


_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_


However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There is
no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be flexible
and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to determine
whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. In order to recognize
whether a word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has
heard before (i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent
an additional challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a
second language.


 - If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:


_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is fairly straightforward.


Foundational Skills 5


  - When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings in
the words


_ban · gle_ _twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_


In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings represent
the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a combination of stressed
and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed or weakly stressed, its
vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that linguists call a schwa.
This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’ and
‘tion’. Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite challenging for many
students.


  - Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the
schwa sound has a particular spelling:


_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is actually a schwa syllable, but it is identified
separately because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


  - Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables accordingly
throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _tri·cycle_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness_ _help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten–Grade
3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.
