# **Welcome!**
## **Grade 2, Unit 3** **Foundational Skills**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will learn spelling alternatives for vowel sounds.


**What** **will** **my** **student** **learn?**


Students will learn the following vowel sounds in this unit: /ae/ spelled ‘a_e’ ( _cake_ ), ‘a’ ( _paper_ ), ‘ai’ ( _wait_ ), and ‘ay’ ( _day_ );

/oe/ spelled ‘o_e’ ( _home_ ), ‘o’ ( _open_ ), ‘oa’ ( _boat_ ), and ‘oe’ ( _toe_ ); /ie/ spelled ‘i_e’ ( _bite_ ), ‘i’ ( _biting_ ), and ‘ie’ ( _tie_ ); /ue/ spelled ‘ue’

( _cue_ ), ‘u_e’ ( _cute_ ), and ‘u’ ( _unit_ ); and /aw/ spelled ‘aw’ ( _paw_ ), ‘au’ ( _Paul_ ), and ‘augh’ ( _caught_ ). Students will work on each

vowel sound pattern for several days. In addition, students will learn that there are only two vowel sounds that are

almost always spelled one way. One is /a/, which is almost always spelled ‘a’, as in _at_ . The other is /ar/, which is almost

always spelled ‘ar’, as in _car_ . The Reader for this unit is _Kids_ _Excel._ This Reader consists of fictional profiles of kids who

excel at various activities—spelling, swimming, playing soccer, jumping rope, splashing, doing math, and skipping rocks.

Students will also practice writing their own personal narrative in this unit.
