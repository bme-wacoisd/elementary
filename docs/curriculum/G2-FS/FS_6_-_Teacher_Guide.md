**Grade 2 | Foundational Skills 6**
Introduction


~~**UNIT 6 OVERVIEW**~~


This unit is devoted to introducing several new spelling alternatives for vowel and consonant sounds.


In this unit you will introduce the following:


**Spelling Alternatives for Vowel Sounds**

  - /er/ > ‘ar’ ( _dollar_ )


  - /er/ > ‘or’ ( _work_ )


**Tricky Spellings for Vowel Sounds**

  - ‘ea’ > /e/ ( _head_ )


  - ‘i’ > /ee/ ( _ski_ )


  - ‘a’ > /o/ ( _lava_ )


**Spelling Alternatives for Consonant Sounds**

  - /f/ > ‘ph’ ( _phone_ )


  - /k/ > ‘ch’ ( _school_ )


**Tricky Spellings**


The tricky spellings ‘ea’, ‘ar’, ‘or’, ‘i’, and ‘a’ are explicitly addressed in this unit. Remember that as more
and more tricky spellings are introduced, it increases the challenge that students face when reading.
Remind them to use their puzzling skills, such as chunking words into syllables, trying alternative sounds
for specific spellings, referring to the Individual Code Chart and Spelling Trees, and using context when
they encounter challenging words. If you find that students still need additional practice decoding these
tricky spellings, you can choose among tricky spelling activities listed in the Additional Support activities
at the end of the lessons and in the Pausing Point.


**Code Knowledge**


Students who have mastered the letter-sound correspondences taught in this program up to this
point have learned most of the important letter-sound correspondences they need to read English
writing. The ones they have not explicitly studied are relatively rare letter-sound correspondences
that come up perhaps once in every 2,000–3,000 words. Most students will be able to decode the
occasional unusual spelling by using the puzzling strategies that you have taught them. For this


Introduction
**1**


**2**



reason, we will continue to encourage you to ask students to use the Individual Code Chart, syllable
chunking, and context to puzzle out unfamiliar words. At this point in Grade 2, many students are
already reading trade books and other publications that are not controlled for decodability.


Any student who has done well with the program up to this point can be encouraged—or, if you like,
required—to read trade books and textbooks written at an appropriate level. Students should be
strongly encouraged to self-select reading material. It is important to move students toward taking
responsibility for their own learning.


**Tricky Words**


Tricky Words are introduced in this unit on an as-needed basis in the context of the different selections
included in the Reader. Tricky Words should be taught in the lessons before the reading selections are
assigned. When introducing Tricky Words, be sure to draw attention to the parts that are read (and
spelled) just as students would expect based on what they have learned so far, and also point out the
tricky parts of each word.


The Tricky Words taught in this unit are:


Lesson 5— _Great Britain, Europe, native, Americans, war, signature_


Lesson 11— _imagine, soldier, Washington_


Lesson 13— _iron_


Lesson 15— _special_


Lesson 17— _shoe_


Lesson 19— _Fort McHenry_


Lesson 21— _early, whose, broad, bomb_


Lesson 23— _Andrew, new_


As you introduce new spelling patterns, you will notice that some words previously introduced as
Tricky Words can be seen as part of spelling patterns. For example, after you have taught ‘ph’ as a
spelling alternative for /f/, the words _paragraph_ and _elephant_ no longer need to be treated as Tricky
Words. They can be described as members of a larger spelling pattern that includes words like _phone_
and _graph_ . As spelling patterns are introduced, the corresponding words should be removed from the
Tricky Word Wall.


Foundational Skills 6


**Decodable Reader: The War of 1812**


The Reader for this unit is _The War of 1812_ . The War of 1812 is important historically as it was the first
foreign conflict that the United States faced as a young nation.


Students have already been introduced to the topic of the War of 1812 earlier this year in the
Knowledge Strand. However, although students have been listening to nonfiction selections in the
Knowledge Strand since Kindergarten, this is the first complex, nonfiction text students will read as
part of the program. It is also recommended that you use the Flip Book for The War of 1812 unit to
show the images to students as you share the Read-Aloud.


Reading nonfiction presents different challenges for students than reading fiction. As you know
from your experience with the Knowledge units, it is imperative that students possess the necessary
background knowledge to fully understand the text they will be reading. Multiple tools for introducing
the unit are included to ensure that students activate prior knowledge. A brief review of early American
history using selected images is included at the beginning of the Reader. Materials for the creation of a
timeline have also been included. Using the timeline, students will be able to contextualize the events
of the War of 1812 as they read the various chapters of the Reader.


Another challenge of nonfiction text is the inclusion of unit-specific vocabulary. For this reason,
the Reader also includes a new feature—a glossary—that students will be taught to use to better
understand the text they are reading. A copy of the glossary is included at the end of the Activity Book,
so students can take it home to use when reading take-home copies of the chapters from the Reader.
In addition, there are opportunities for students to use a digital dictionary and a digital glossary,
building on their skills in using the glossary in the Reader.


Significant scaffolding is also provided for the lessons in the Reader. Additionally, teacher modeling of
note-taking opportunities is included in the lessons. As students progress through the Reader, it may
be useful to have them periodically read through the notes that you will leave on display.


In this unit, Reading will occur first in each lesson where it appears. This is a shift from previous units
and is done to help prepare students for reading in Grade 3, which also occurs first in every lesson.


**Timeline Image Cards**


Included in the unit materials are Image Cards for you to arrange in a timeline. These materials will be
powerful tools for you to present to students. Find space in your room to display the entire timeline
during this unit. You will display specific Timeline Image Cards at various times throughout the unit.
At this point in the year, you may find that you can easily take down materials that students no longer
reference in order to make a space for these Timeline Image Cards to be displayed. You will likely need
to extend the timeline on more than one wall.


Introduction

**Purposeful Re-Reading**


With the adoption of the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Standards, increasing attention has been
focused on the practice of purposeful re-reading. At the Grade 2 reading level, text-dependent questions
continue to be the focus. In this unit, direction is included for teachers to utilize a purposeful re-reading
approach with several chapters from the Reader. These lessons are carefully crafted to focus the student
on the text itself and the meanings that can be derived from a purposeful examination of that text.
However, student referral to the text in front of them is a critical element of purposeful re-reading.


Additionally, you will note that wherever these lessons occur (Lessons 12, 14, 16, 22, 24, and 26 of this
unit), the commitment to using decodable text in the Reader and Activity Book does not waiver. This is
the first and only unit in Grade 2 with purposeful re-reading lessons for nonfiction text.


**Grammar**


In Unit 6, students will continue to review grammar skills introduced in previous units. In addition
to the parts of speech that they already know—common and proper nouns; present-, past-, and
future-tense verbs; and adjectives—students will learn to identify and use adverbs. The focus of the
remaining grammar lessons is on the sentence as a unit. Building on their knowledge of subjects and
predicates, students will learn to identify complete versus incomplete sentences. They will also learn
to identify run-on sentences, as well as ways to correct these sentences. Finally, they will begin to
work on writing increasingly detailed sentences.


 - Throughout the unit, students may also practice decoding and spelling abbreviations used in titles,
addresses, and dates.


 - Tell students that using the word _mister_ or _missus_ before a person’s name is usually a way of showing
respect. Explain that when we abbreviate these words to go before a person’s name, we write it _Mr_ .
and _Mrs_ . Write these on the board and have students say _mister_ and _missus_ with you.


 - Explain that _Mrs_ . is used before the name of a married woman, and _Ms_ . (an abbreviation for miss) is
used before the name of a girl or an unmarried woman. Tell students that _Ms_ . can also be used if they
aren’t sure whether a woman is married or not.


 - On their own paper, have students write the title and name of an adult they respect.


 - Explain that we also use abbreviations for parts of addresses, such as _United States_, and _District of_
_Columbia_ . Write the abbreviation for each on the board.


 - Finally, explain that abbreviations can also be used for months of the year and days of the week.
Write _Monday, Mon., January,_ and _Jan_ . on the board.


 - Have students write today’s date, including the day of the week, on their own paper.
(e.g., _Fri., Nov. 11, 2022_ ) ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iv; TEKS 2.2.C.iii**~~


**TEKS 2.2.B.iv** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding compound words, contractions, and common abbreviations; **TEKS 2.2.C** Demonstrate
and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling one-syllable words with closed syllables; open syllables: VCe syllables: vowel teams, including digraphs and
diphthongs; r-controlled syllables, and final stable syllables; (iii) spelling compound words, contractions, and common abbreviations; (iv) spelling multisyllabic
words with multiple sound-spelling patterns.


Foundational Skills 6


**Spelling**


Weekly spelling lists and assessments continue in this unit. The spelling lists in Lessons 1, 6, and 11
continue to be made up of words with letter-sound correspondences that students have already been
taught. The spelling lists in Lessons 16, 21, and 26 consist solely of content-based words students
have encountered in the Reader.


During writing activities, students will have an opportunity to practice correctly spelling highfrequency words and words with sound-spellings they have learned. Refer to the scope and sequence
as needed to determine if the sound-spelling has been previously taught, and focus on those words
when reviewing their writing. Many writing assignments also use an editing checklist, so students
should be checking their spelling before submitting their assignment.


Students will also create a Dictation Journal that focuses on spelling words in isolation as well as in
sentences. Spelling assessments will also incorporate a phrase or sentence that students must spell
correctly.


  - For the dictation journal, you can either have students use a journal they use for other writing
activities or you may wish to create a small dictation journal for each student. Stapling five pieces of
paper together is all you will need for each journal. ~~**TEKS 2.2.C.i; TEKS 2.2.C.iv**~~


**Writing**


In Grade 2, students have thus far practiced writing personal narratives, as well as writing new story
endings and story summaries. They have also practiced persuasive writing in the context of a friendly
letter. At the end of this unit, they will be introduced to expository or report writing. This form of
writing is well suited to the nonfiction text they are reading.


Report writing is focused on organizing information into paragraphs, each with a topic sentence and
supporting details. The lessons have been written to build upon what students have learned about the
War of 1812.


At this point, students have learned at least one way to write nearly every sound in English, with the
exception of the very rare /zh/ as in _treasure_ . You should continue to expect, however, that students’
drafts will contain some incorrect spellings. At a minimum, the spellings students write in their drafts
should be phonemically plausible; that is, students should write a plausible spelling for each sound
in the word. Students can be asked to correct misspellings in drafts using the Individual Code Chart,
Spelling Trees, and word walls as references. You may want to have more advanced students use a
dictionary, both print and digital, to verify spellings. Editing for spelling is incorporated in the writing
lessons in this unit and can also be incorporated into supplemental writing assignments. If students
have access to computers for writing assignments, you are strongly encouraged to teach them how to
use the available spell-check feature.


**TEKS 2.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling one-syllable words with closed syllables; open syllables: VCe syllables: vowel teams,
including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables, and final stable syllables; (iii) spelling compound words, contractions, and common abbreviations; (iv)
spelling multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns.


Introduction
**5**


**6**



**Left-Handed Cursive Guidance**


Left-handed writers need to grip the writing instrument far enough back from the point to see what
is being written and not smear what has just been written. Have students grip the pencil around 1-1.5
inches from the point.


Have students tilt their paper so their arm is at a right angle to the bottom edge. This will allow the
wrist to sit at a natural arc while writing.


Have students write with their hands below the writing line and the wrist straight.


Immediately correct students who use a “hooked’ style of writing, because this may cause strain to
the wrist.


Allow your left-handed students to hold their pen or pencil with a relaxed grip, as gripping too tightly
can cause hand fatigue and strain.


Encourage your left-handed students to slant their writing to the left rather than to the right. This will
help them write more smoothly and with less smudging.


Model cursive letter formation for your left-handed students, showing them how to form each letter
from the left to the right.


Provide your left-handed students with plenty of practice time as they develop their skills.


~~**UNIT 6 ASSESSMENT**~~


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


Throughout this unit, formative assessments are clearly marked for monitoring individual student
performance and progress in key skills. Quick “Checks for Understanding” to evaluate classroom
performance as a whole are also designated in various lessons.


You will be prompted to assess students’ oral reading with the Anecdotal Reading Record, as well
as to make notes regarding student responses to discussion questions about the chapters they are
reading. As in earlier units, specific directions for analyzing errors on weekly spelling assessments
are included. You will also be prompted to collect and review activity book pages on the new spelling
alternatives and tricky spellings taught in this unit.


Careful attention to this information, collected on a daily basis, will enable you to quickly determine
which students may benefit from reteaching and/or more practice in particular skills, using the
Additional Support activities found at the end of each lesson.


**Student Performance Assessment**


In Lesson 27, you will be prompted to administer a multipart end-of-unit assessment. Students will be
asked to answer written comprehension questions about the information they learned from reading
_The War of 1812_ .


Foundational Skills 6


**End-of-Year Assessment**


An End-of-Year Assessment for students using the program for Grade 2 is provided, starting in Lesson
33. **You should administer this year-end assessment even if students have not fully completed**
**all units of the Grade 2 program.**


**Administer the Silent Reading Comprehension Assessment to all students.** The story used will
be completely decodable for students who have completed Unit 6.


This assessment allows you to gauge students’ independent reading proficiency and comprehension.
It also allows you to do additional follow-up assessment for students who may be struggling. You will
ask students in the class to silently read a story called “The Young Mouse” and to then answer a set of
multiple-choice questions about the story.


The **Fluency Assessment** makes use of the same story, “The Young Mouse,” for assessment of reading
accuracy and fluency. As you listen to individual students read the story aloud, you will make a running
record and take a measurement of fluency. **This section should at least be administered to all**
**students who miss two or more of the eight questions on the Silent Reading Comprehension**
**Assessment.**


**The Word Reading in Isolation Assessment** is a word-reading assessment designed to assess
students’ ability to read the specific spellings taught or reviewed in Grade 2. Ideally, you should
administer this assessment to all students. However, **if time is limited, you may choose to administer**
**this section only to those students to whom you administered the Fluency Assessment, or to**
**those students in your classroom who are most at risk.**


You are strongly encouraged to share the results of this assessment with students’ Grade 3 teachers.
A summary sheet ( **Activity Page 33.3** ) is provided that can be passed on to Grade 3 teachers with
students’ assessment information.


~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice the Unit 6 skills can be found in the
Pausing Point section included after the last lesson. It is strongly recommended that you pause for 3
days to provide targeted remediation for individual or groups of students in any areas in which they
performed poorly on the end-of-unit assessment. In addition, a partner reading lesson for Chapter 13,
“Dolley Madison,” is included.


~~**THE FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


See the directions in _The Fluency Supplement_ for further guidance.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


In the Teacher Resources section at the end of the Teacher’s Guide, you will find forms and charts
which may be useful, including the following:

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


In this lesson, you will teach a spelling alternative for the /f/ sound: ‘ph’ as
in _phone_ . Students should already know the basic code spelling ‘f’ as in _fit_
and the spelling alternative ‘ff’ as in _stuff_ . The following chart shows which
of these spellings is most common for the /f/ sound.


Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


  - ‘ **f** ’ is the most common spelling for the /f/ sound. It is used in initial position
( _fun_, _fig_ ), in final position ( _leaf_, _deaf_ ), in the initial consonant clusters _fl–_ and
_fr–_ ( _flop_, _fresh_ ), in the final consonant clusters _–ft_, _–fth_, and _–lf_ ( _lift_, _fifth_, _elf_ ),
and with separated digraphs ( _safe_, _life_ ).


  - Only ‘ **f** ’ and ‘ **ph** ’ are used at the beginning of words and syllables.


  - ‘ **f** ’, ‘ **ff** ’, and ‘ **ph** ’ are used at the end of words and syllables.


  - ‘ **ff** ’ is commonly found after “short” vowels written with single-letter
spellings; thus we write _stiff_ but _beef_ .


  - ‘ **ph** ’ is used mainly to spell words borrowed from Greek; it is used in the
consonant cluster _–mph_ ( _lymph_ ).


  - Words with final /f/ tend to keep the spelling they have in the root form, even
when suffixes beginning with a vowel sound are added: _leaf_   - _leafy_ ; _oaf_   _oafish_ ; _stuff_   - _stuffy_ .


  - Note that there is one spelling for the /f/ sound that appears on the code
chart but is not taught here: ‘ **gh** ’ as in _tough_ .


**Foundational Skills**

  - You may wish to tab Consonant Code Flip Book page 9 for Introduce
/f/ > ‘ph’. Also have the Spelling Card listed in the Lesson at a Glance chart,
student Individual Code Charts, and red markers readily available.


Lesson 1 Spelling Alternatives: Introduce /f/ › ‘ph’

 - Write each of the following words on an index card for Introduce /f/ > ‘ph’:
_phone_, _graph_, _phantom_, _phase_, _phonics_, _Joseph_, _elephant_, _dolphin_, _phrase_,
_trophy_, _photo_, _alphabet_, _pharmacy_, _orphan_, _Philip_, _autograph_, _sphere_ . You will
use these cards again in the next lesson.


) **Digital Component 1.1**


 - Create an enlarged version of Activity Page 1.1 (Digital Component 1.1) to
display for Introduce /f/ > ‘ph’, or use the digital version.


**Language**

 - Write the alphabet vertically on the board/chart paper as a reference for
students, as needed; most students have internalized the alphabet sequence
so they are able to alphabetize words on their own. You will not be “matching”
words to the alphabet as you did in the early lessons of Unit 5.


 - Write this week’s spelling words on index cards for Introduce Spelling Words,
underlining the targeted spelling alternative. Have paper clips handy for folding
over the cards to display partial words for the alphabetizing activity.


**Universal Access**

 - Gather pictures, or the actual objects, for the following words for
Introduce /f/ > ‘ph’: _phone_, _graph_, _elephant_, _dolphin_, _trophy_, _pharmacy_,
_autograph_, and _sphere_ .

Code Materials








  - Review each spelling with the Speedy Sound Hunt game, saying the following
instructions:


    - Say, “You will begin with the Individual Code Chart closed on your desk. I
will tell you a sound. All of the sounds will be consonant sounds. When I say
‘go’, I want to see who can raise their hand first to tell me the page number
where I will find that sound. I will call on that student. Then, I will call on
others to tell me all of the spellings for the sound.”


    - Then say, “I am thinking of the sound (insert sound from the box). Ready? Go!”

    - Call on one student to give you the page number from the Individual Code
Chart for the sound.


    - Then, call on other students to tell you the different spellings for each
sound. The page numbers for the Individual Code Chart have been
included in the box.


    - When reviewing the spellings for /f/, point out that there are two /f/
spellings that they have not yet learned. Note that students will learn
one of those spellings today: ‘ph’ can be used to represent /f/.


**TEKS 2.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (ii) decoding words with silent letters such as knife and gnat; (i)
decoding words with short, long, or variant vowels, trigraphs, and blends.

following page of the Consonant Code Flip Book:

|Consonant Code Flip Book|Individual Code Chart|
|---|---|
|1.<br>/f/ > ‘ph’ (_phone_) page 9|1.<br>/f/ > ‘ph’ (_phone_) **page 3**|



 - Tell students that they are going to practice /f/ > ‘ph’.


 - Remind students that they have learned /f/ as ‘f’ in _fit_, and /f/ as ‘ff’ in _stuff_ .


 - Show students the Spelling Card for /f/ > ‘ph’ ( _phone_ ). Have students
read the sample word. Discuss the power bar. Add the Spelling Card to the
Consonant Code Flip Book.


 - Tell students that today’s letter-sound correspondence can be found on
**page 3** of the **Individual Code Chart** .


**Note:** The Tricky Words _paragraph, elephant, alphabet,_ and _humph_ can now be
understood by students as part of a larger spelling pattern. They should now be
removed from the Tricky Word Wall if you have one.


 - Hand out the red markers. Have students turn to **page 3** of the **Individual**
**Code Chart** . Guide students in outlining the appropriate card on the chart.


 - Have students look at the Individual Code Chart. Ask students which of the
spellings they have learned for /f/ has the longest power bar. _(‘f’)_


 - Tape the prepared cards on the board/chart paper, one at a time, circling the
spellings that stand for /f/: _phone_, _graph_, _phantom_, _phase_, _phonics_, _Joseph_,
_elephant_, _dolphin_, _phrase_, _trophy_, _photo_, _alphabet_, _pharmacy_, _orphan_, _Philip_,
_autograph_, _sphere_ .


 - Read each word aloud as a class. Point out that the ‘ph’ spelling for /f/ can occur
at the beginning, middle, or end of a word.

  - Ask students to explain what an apostrophe in a word means. _(It can indicate_
_a contraction, taking the place of letters to combine two words into one, such_
_as in_ can’t _;_ _–’s at the end of a word can shows ownership; the person, or_
_owner, owns something.)_


  - Ask students for examples of words with an apostrophe as part of a
contraction. _(Examples might include shouldn’t, didn’t, wasn’t, etc.)_


  - Ask students for examples of word pairs showing ownership. _(Examples_
_might include Jayden’s book, Eva’s backpack, Mrs. Carter’s chair, etc.)_


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 1.2 and do the first item as an example.
Note that a “key” is provided for each item so students will know how many
parts of speech to identify in each sentence _(box around_ Sisters Forever _;_
_wiggly line under_ is _; arrow from_ good _to_ film _; circle around_ film _)._

 - Remind students that they can use what they have learned about closed
syllables to read and spell the words. Point out the /i/ sound in _rip•ple_ and
the /e/ sound in _west•ern_ .


Foundational Skills 6


- Tell students that you will now put the words in alphabetical order on another
part of the board/chart paper. Fold over the cards as you did in Unit 5, and paper
clip them so that just the first letter shows.


- Ask: “Do you see any words that begin with ‘a’? No ... ‘b’? Yes, _Britain_ begins
with ‘b’.” (Tape the card for _Britain_ to the board/chart paper some distance
away from the alphabet.) “‘c’? No. ‘d’? Yes, I have a ‘d’ card. So I will tape the
card with the word that starts with ‘d’ under the word _dolphin_ . Any words with
‘e’? No. ‘f’? Yes, I have two cards that begin with ‘f’. I wonder how we know
which one to put first? Let me fold over the card to show one more letter.“
(Fold the cards so the ‘fe’ and ‘fi’ are visible.) “Oh, I see. ‘e’ comes before ‘i’ in
the alphabet, so I will put ‘fe’ card under the ‘d’ card and before the ‘fi’ card.”


- Continue in this way through the cards.


- Unfold the cards and read the words aloud with students.


- Tell students that the words are now in alphabetical order.










  - If possible, leave the words on display until the assessment, so students can
refer to them during the week.


  - Tell students that it’s important to be able to spell words in sentences.
Explain that they will write an entire sentence that you dictate during the
Spelling Assessment, and they will practice now. Students may use their
Dictation Journal.


  - Dictate the sentence: _The dolphin swam all the way to Britain_ .

Foundational Skills 6


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


In this lesson, you will introduce students to various genres and formats
of nonfiction. You will need to have a copy of _The Cat Bandit_ as well as
a nonfiction trade book about cats. Additionally, you will need to collect
examples of the following genres and formats of nonfiction: history,
biography, science, atlas, newspaper, magazine, and (if feasible) a website.
Try to pick examples that you think may be of interest to students. For
biography, you may wish to display a mix of book-length biographies and
shorter articles, such as a biographical profile from a magazine.


Create displays around the room, grouping and numbering similar genres
together. For example, a group of history books might be numbered ‘1’, a
group of science books might be numbered ‘2’, and so on. Be sure to include
a copy of the Unit 6 Reader _The War of 1812_ in the group of history books.
Students will need to access these materials as they do the scavenger hunt
activity in the lesson.


This would be a good time to arrange a presentation by a school librarian
who can show students how to find books, including nonfiction books,
in your school library.


You will notice that Reading comes first in this lesson. Throughout this unit,
Reading will be taught first in the lessons, rather than Foundational Skills.
This is the first and only unit in Grade 2 during which students will read a
nonfiction Reader. Having the Reading segment of the lesson first will help
students focus their attention on reading the more challenging nonfiction
text in the Reader. In addition, having the Reading segment first will prepare
students for Grade 3 instruction in which Reading comes first in each lesson.


**Reading**

  - Gather a copy of _The Cat Bandit_ as well as a nonfiction trade book about cats.


  - Collect and display examples of nonfiction genres as described above.

**Primary Focus:** Students will learn about the difference between fiction and nonfiction
books, will be introduced to various genres of nonfiction texts and their organizational
structures, and will display an understanding of nonfiction texts by correctly identifying
features of nonfiction genres. ~~**TEKS 2.9.D.ii; TEKS 2.9.D.iii**~~


~~**INTRODUCE NONFICTION**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.9.D.ii; TEKS 2.9.D.iii**~~


  - Tell students that books and texts that we read can be grouped into two
different categories or genres. The genres are called fiction and nonfiction.


  - Tell students that fiction is an invented or “made-up” story (i.e., an author
creates fiction stories and books from his or her imagination). They are not
stories that actually happened. Remind students of the Reader _The Cat_
_Bandit_ . Ask if anyone remembers what _The Cat Bandit_ was about. _(It was_
_about a mischievous cat that loved to eat different kinds of food.)_
) **Digital Component 2.1**


  - Direct students’ attention to the T-chart you prepared in advance.


  - Ask students for some characteristics of the book _The Cat Bandit_ . Record
students’ answers on the T-chart. You may want to remind students of the
various terms you have used throughout the year in talking about stories
(e.g., characters, setting, and plot). Responses may include:

    - fiction or “made-up” story about a pet cat created by the author

    - based on the author’s imagination

    - All of the cat bandit’s adventures are highly unlikely (i.e., it is unlikely that
an actual cat would have all of these adventures, be so clever, and eat all
the things the cat bandit ate).

    - Pictures were drawn by an illustrator based on his or her imagination to
accompany the events in the stories.


  - Next, show students the nonfiction book about cats that you have available.


  - Tell students that nonfiction books are true and contain facts that provide
information about the subject.


**TEKS 2.9.D** Recognize characteristics and structures of informational text, including (ii) features and graphics to locate and
gain information; (iii) organizational patterns such as chronological order and cause and effect stated explicitly.


Lesson 2 Reading: Text Features in Informational Text
**27**


Reader




 - Ask students to help you record some characteristics of the nonfiction book
about cats. Some responses might include:

   - There are no stories with invented characters, settings, or plots.

   - It is about real cats.

   - It contains facts and information about cats.

   - The pictures may include actual photographs, though there may be
illustrations as well.


 - Tell students that fiction books are made up of stories with characters,
settings, and plots that have been created by authors. Fiction books do often
incorporate elements that _could_ be real (e.g., families can have pet cats that
get into lots of things).


 - State that nonfiction books include facts and information about real-life
things. People read nonfiction books when they want to learn about a specific
topic or person.


**Note:** You may consider recording these two definitions in the manner in
which you prepared for in advance.


 - Tell students that in the Knowledge strand, they have listened to both fiction
and nonfiction Read-Alouds. Ask students to identify several examples of each.
_(Responses for fiction units might include_ Fairy Tales and Tall Tales _,_ Stories from
Mount Olympus _, or any of the individual stories they have heard. Nonfiction unit_
_examples might include_ The Ancient Greek Civilization _,_ The U.S. Civil War _,_ Cycles
of Nature: Clouds to Raindrops _,_ Insects: All Around _, and so on.)_

 - Explain that there are many specific kinds of nonfiction and that you have
prepared some displays of different books around the room.


**History**

 - Explain that one type of nonfiction book that tells about events that
happened in the past is a history book.

 - Ask students what history is. _(History is a record of things that happened in_
_the past.)_

 - Explain that history books are often told in chronological order, or in the
order in which events happened. Show students the display of history books.
Show students a copy of the Reader for Unit 6, pointing out that it is a history
book as well. Although students have listened to many nonfiction selections
during the Knowledge strand, this is the first nonfiction Reader that students
will encounter during the Skills part of Grade 2.

 - Ask students if any of them has ever read any nonfiction history books.
If so, ask what the book was about and how was the information organized.
(Students may also wish to discuss history selections they have heard read
aloud in the Knowledge lessons.)


Foundational Skills 6



**28**


  - Explain to students that readers can make predictions about informational
texts using what they know about how these texts are structured. Authors
use different types of organizational patterns such as chronological order
and cause and effect, or they may group information and use headings to
show what a portion of the text will be about.

  - Ask students if there are any parts of history that they are interested in and
about which they would like to learn more. Encourage them to use the word
_history_ in their responses: “I would like to learn more about the history of . . .”
**Biography**

  - Explain that biography is another genre of nonfiction. Explain that a
biography is a particular type of history book. Like all history books,
biographies tell about the past, but biographies focus specifically on a
person’s life. A biography may be about a person who is still alive today.

  - Explain that like history books, biographies usually have a chronological
structure. Show students the display of biographies.

  - Ask students about what kinds of predictions they could make about a
biography using what they know about chronological order.

  - Ask students if any of them has ever read (or listened to) a biography.
If so, ask who it was about. _(Answers may vary_ . _)_

  - Ask students if there are people they are interested in and would like to
read a biography about. Encourage them to use the word _biography_ in their
responses: “I would like to read a biography about . . .”
**Science**

  - Repeat the same steps for science books, introducing several titles on display.
Talk with students about the science nonfiction books they have read or heard
read aloud, and about the science topics they would like to learn about.

  - Tell students that science books often have a cause-and-effect structure.
The author explains why something happens and the effects of it. Show
students a science nonfiction book with a cause and effect structure and ask
what types of predictions can we make using what we know about the cause
and effect text structure.

  - Ask students if any of them has ever read a science nonfiction book. If so, ask
what the book was about and whether the author provided reasons to why
something happened. _(Answers may vary.)_
**Atlas**

  - Introduce an atlas, and explain that this is a special kind of nonfiction book
called a reference book. This particular type of reference book is called an
atlas and is filled with maps.

  - Show students one or two of the maps in the atlas.

  - Explain that an atlas can also appear in other formats besides books, such
as online.

 - Explain that newspapers generally have articles about things that are
currently taking place, are about to happen, or have already happened.
These kinds of articles are nonfiction.


 - Explain to students that the structure of a newspaper article depends on the
topic of the article.


 - Ask students if they have ever looked at a newspaper. _(Answers may vary.)_


 - Leaf through different parts of the paper, pointing out different sections,

remember the kinds of nonfiction they learned about in this lesson.


 - Pair students. Emphasize that students must work together but should keep
their answers hidden from the other teams as they will be in competition with
the other teams. Suggest that they keep their papers covered as they move
about the room.


 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 2.1. Each team should use only one
activity page and write both team members’ names on the Name: line.


 - Provide students with any rules that you feel may be necessary for moving
about the room (e.g., no running, only three teams at a time at any one
display). Tell students that when you say, “Go!” each team should read an
item on the activity page and then decide which display of books is the
correct answer for that item and write the number of the display on the
blank line. The point is not to be the fastest, but to try to answer all of the
items correctly.

have students stay seated and divide the class into teams by the formation in
which they are seated.)


 - Each team takes a “turn at bat” as follows:


   - Set a timer for ten minutes, and tell students that whichever team has the
most runs when the timer rings is the winning team. Point out that accuracy
is important, but so is speed in reading words quickly. The more turns that
players have to read words, the more likely their team is to score runs.


   - Pick a card from the pile and ask the first person on the team to read it
aloud. If the word is read correctly, draw a line from home plate to first
base, signifying a “hit.” This player then goes to the back of his team’s line,
while the next player comes forward to read the next card. If they read
the word correctly, draw a line from first to second base. Play continues
this way.


   - If the fourth player reads the word correctly, draw a line from third base to
home plate and mark “1 run” for the team.


   - Play continues for this team so long as no words are misread; when a word
is misread, the next team takes its turn at bat.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


The Unit 6 Skills components include a set of twenty Timeline Cards
depicting events in early American history that you will use to create a visual
timeline to help students contextualize the time period during which the War
of 1812 took place.


Prior to the lesson, survey the wall space in your classroom to determine an
appropriate place to create a timeline. It is important that the timeline be
readily accessible to students. If possible, place the timeline on one or more
classroom walls at students’ eye level.


You may want to cut out a strip of bulletin board paper long enough to
eventually accommodate all twenty of the Timeline Cards, and tape it to the
classroom wall(s). You may also want to identify the start of the timeline
by writing the date _1492_ at the top or bottom of the timeline. [This is where
Timeline Card 1 (Christopher Columbus) will be placed during the lesson.]
At the end of the timeline, you may want to write the date _1865_ at the top or
bottom. [This is where Card 20 (Lee surrenders to Grant) will be placed.] It is
fine if the timeline wraps around a corner and continues on a second wall.


Today you will teach a spelling alternative for the /e/ sound: ‘ea’ as in _head_ .
The following chart shows you that ‘e’ is, by far, the most common spelling
for this sound. However, there are more than 200 words that have /e/ spelled
‘ea’, so it is important that students learn this spelling alternative. Students
should already know the basic code spelling ‘e’ as in _pet_ . The ‘ea’ spelling is
likely to be unfamiliar to many students, although some may have learned to
decode this spelling during independent reading.


Foundational Skills 6


Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


  - The sound /e/ is very rarely used at the end of a word ( _eh, yeh_ ).


  - The /e/ sound is usually spelled with an ‘ **e** ’ at the beginning of a word ( _exit,_
_elephant, end_ ).


  - The ‘ **ea** ’ spelling for /e/ appears most often in the middle of a word, with a
consonant spelling on either side ( _head, bread_ ).


  - Note that there is one spelling for the /e/ sound that is not taught: ‘ **ai** ’
as in _said, captain_, and _again_ . Words with this pattern will continue to be
introduced as Tricky Words.


**Reading**

  - Prepare space for a timeline as previously described.


  - Gather previously prepared Wiggle Cards to use during the Reading lesson if
students need a break while reviewing the “Introduction to _The War of 1812_ .”


  - Prepare to group students into small groups to discuss the Timeline Cards.


**Foundational Skills**

  - You may wish to tab Vowel Code Flip Book page 3 for Introduce /e/ > ‘ea’.
Also have the Spelling Card listed in the Lesson at a Glance chart, student
Individual Code Charts, and green markers readily available.


  - Prepare a new branch for the /e/ Spelling Tree (from Unit 4).


  - Prepare the following new leaves for the Spelling Tree: _head, bread, dead,_
_dread, thread, spread, tread, sweater, breath_, and _health_ .


) **Digital Component 3.1**


  - Create an enlarged version of Activity Page 3.1 (Digital Component 3.1)

         - Show students the front cover of the Reader, _The War of 1812_ . Explain that
Reader
this is their first nonfiction Reader.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to explain the genre of nonfiction. _(Nonfiction is about true events,_



Page 2



_people, places, or things in the real world.)_ Ask students to identify some

organizational patterns that nonfiction texts use. _(chronological, cause and effect)_


  - Tell students that this Reader describes a war that happened a long, long
time ago, beginning in the year of 1812. Our young country, the United States,
battled against Great Britain.


  - Remind students that earlier in Grade 2, they completed a unit in the
Knowledge strand on the War of 1812, so the information they will learn in
this unit should be familiar to them.


  - Now, ask students to look back at the cover and tell you what they see.
Prompt students as needed so they notice and describe the following
features of the illustration:


    - Based on the way the men are dressed, the images seems to depict a time
period long ago.


    - They should observe that the men are on a boat.


    - Point out that the younger boy is resting his arm on a cannon.


**TEKS 2.9.D** Recognize characteristics and structures of informational text, including (ii) features and graphics to locate and
gain information; (iii) organizational patterns such as chronological order and cause and effect stated explicitly.


Foundational Skills 6



**38**


    - Guide students in understanding that a cannon was a type of weapon used
long ago in wars, so this boat is probably a warship.

    - The men are looking toward the land and the American flag.


  - Ask students to turn to the table of contents and identify how many chapters
there are in this Reader. _(13)_ Also point out that the Reader has an introduction.
Remind students that the table of contents is helpful in finding the starting
pages of each chapter so they can quickly find their place when reading.


  - Share with students that this Reader has a new feature that they have not
seen in a Reader before. It is called a glossary. Tell students that a glossary
is placed at the end of a book. Guide students in finding the glossary in their
own Reader. Tell students that the glossary contains definitions of important
vocabulary words that occur in the Reader. Ask students why they think a
glossary might be helpful. _(It provides explanations and information for words_
_a person might not know a lot about.)_


**Note:** A copy of the glossary is provided in Teacher Resources for
your reference.


  - Read the first six words aloud in the glossary; then point out the first letter of
each word: **a** _nthem_, **a** _rmy_, **b** _ranch_, **B** _ritish_, **C** _apitol_, **c** _harge_ . Ask students if they
notice a pattern in how the words are arranged. (Students should see that
the words are organized in alphabetical order.) Ask students why they think a
glossary would be organized in alphabetical order. _(It organizes information in_
_a logical way and helps make information easy to locate.)_


  - Point out that there is information provided after each word. Read the
definition for _British_ as an example of the kind of definition they will find for
words in the glossary.


  - Now ask students to turn to **page 12**, while holding their place within the
glossary. Point out the bolded word _British_ and explain that whenever a
word is bolded in the text, it means that it is included in the glossary. Have
students verify that _British_ is in the glossary. Explain that when they are
reading, if they come to a bolded word that they do not understand, they can
always look it up in the glossary.


  - Ask students to look back at the table of contents and find the page on which
the introduction begins. Have them turn to that page. _(page 2)_


  - Note that the pages of the introduction include images and simple captions.
Remind students that a caption provides basic information that lets us
know what the image is about. During this lesson, you will discuss only
the first six pages of the introduction as a way to activate students’
background knowledge.


Lesson 3 Spelling Alternatives and Reading: Introduce /e/ › ‘ea’ and Text Features in Informational Text
**39**


**40**




 - Using the following suggestions, discuss the images on **pages 2–7** in order
to provide context for learning about the War of 1812. You can start by having
students read each caption and share their first impressions and what they
already know about each image. If students provide only partial information,
elicit more comprehensive background information by asking leading
questions and/or elaborating upon students’ responses.


**Note:** Students who completed the Grade 1 sequence should be familiar with
these topics as they were covered in the Knowledge unit _A New Nation: American_
_Independence_ .


**A New Nation: American Independence**

 - Read the title of this section, and remind students that the United States as
we know it today did not always exist.


   - **The United States, Great Britain, and France** —This image shows the
continents of North America and Europe, with the countries of the United
States, Great Britain, and France labeled. Remind students that a long
time ago, the country where they live today, the United States, was not
divided into fifty separate states. Native Americans lived throughout North
America, but it was not as populated (not as many people living in one
area) as it is today. Point out that the Atlantic Ocean divides the United
States from Great Britain and France. Even though these two countries
are far away from the United States, they both played an important role in
early American history.


   - **Christopher Columbus** —(Note for students that the letters ‘Ch’ in
_Christopher_ in the caption sound like /k/.) In 1492, an explorer named
Christopher Columbus sailed from Spain to look for a quicker route to
India and China, places where there were desirable goods such as gold and
spices. Columbus thought he had reached India, so he called the people
he encountered “Indians.” He actually had landed in and explored North
America. Columbus made four voyages altogether.


   - When people heard about Columbus and his travels, other explorers set off
to travel across the ocean to the New World. There were many explorers
from European countries, including France and England.


   - **The Pilgrims** —The Pilgrims were a group of people from England (what
later became Great Britain) who sailed to America on a ship called The
Mayflower to start a new life. The Pilgrims came to North America so they
could have the freedom to practice their own religion. Their first winter in
New England was very hard as the Pilgrims were not used to the weather
and did not know how to grow food in the new land. They depended on
the help of Native Americans for their survival. The first Thanksgiving
celebrated their first successful harvest.


Foundational Skills 6


    - **The Revolutionary War** —The Revolutionary War took place when
America’s thirteen colonies fought for their independence from Great
Britain. To be independent means to be free from the control of others;
the colonies wanted to form their own rules and no longer pay taxes to
Great Britain. The United States won the war.


**The American Government**

  - Read the title of this section and tell students that the early colonists were
determined to govern their new nation differently than how Great Britain
was governed.


    - **The Declaration of Independence** —This document was signed on July
4, 1776. The United States declared, or stated, their independence from
Great Britain. The signing of the Declaration of Independence is celebrated
each summer on the Fourth of July. The document lists the natural rights
that the Founding Fathers believed all people have. The Declaration of
Independence includes the famous line, “all men are created equal” and
that they have the right to “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.”


    - **The Constitution** —This is another important document of the United
States. The Constitution is the highest law in the United States, and it
shapes the laws that affect many aspects of American life. It details how
the country should be governed. A man named James Madison (he was
later elected to be the fourth president) created a plan that shaped the
Constitution. For this reason, he is called the “Father of the Constitution.”
The Constitution starts with the phrase _We the People_ . This means that
the Constitution is meant to represent the people of the United States.
The content of the Constitution can only be changed by the people or
their representatives.


    - **The Founding Fathers** —(Note for students that the letter ‘a’ in _Fathers_ in
the caption sounds like /o/.) George Washington, John Adams, Thomas
Jefferson, and James Madison were the first four presidents after
the United States won its independence from Great Britain. A person
becomes a president by being elected by the people of the United States.
Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison were each elected by the
people to lead the United States as its president. They did not have the
power that a king has, but had to work with others to make big decisions
and pass laws. These four men were also part of a larger group of men
called the Founding Fathers. The Founding Fathers created and signed the
Declaration of Independence and then later the Constitution.


**The British Government**

  - Read the title of this section, and tell students that Great Britain had a very
different form of government than the United States.


Lesson 3 Spelling Alternatives and Reading: Introduce /e/ › ‘ea’ and Text Features in Informational Text
**41**


**42**




   - **King George III** —The king of Great Britain was not elected into this
position by the people he ruled. Instead, he became king because he was
a son of a king. The British people did not have a choice. King George III
ruled in Great Britain during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.
King George III could make his own rules and did not have to get other
people to agree with his decisions.


   - **Where Parliament meets** —(Note for students that the letters ‘ia’ in
_Parliament_ in the caption sound like / ə /.) This is the part of the British
government responsible for making laws. The reigning British king or
queen is the head of Parliament. During the 1700–1800s, the king (or
queen) made the final decision regarding any laws and did not need the
support of Parliament.


**Note:** This is a long time for Grade 2 students to sit and listen. Feel free to
take a break using the Wiggle Cards.


**Early Colonial Life**

 - Read the title of this section and remind students that when the United
States was a young country, life was very different than today.


   - **The 13 original colonies** —Point out that in the beginning, the United
States was not as large a country as it is now. Remind students that people
came to live in the thirteen colonies for different reasons, such as to have
religious freedom or to look for riches.


   - **Colonial farmers** —(Note for students that the letter ‘i’ in _Colonial_ in the
caption sounds like /ee/.) Point out that people living in the new country
survived through agriculture (living off the land through farming).


   - **American port** —Ask students to look back at the map of France and
Great Britain on **page 2** . Explain that the United States sold goods such
as cotton and tobacco to these countries. Ships carried goods from the
United States across the Atlantic Ocean to Great Britain and France.
French and British ships also brought other goods back to the United
States. Transatlantic trade was therefore important for both making
money and for receiving goods.


   - **Westward expansion** —Over time, people began to move west and explore
the land of North America. Pioneers were people who went to explore or
live in a place that they didn’t know very much about. There were people,
referred to as Native Americans, already living in these areas. Native
Americans had been living on the land for a long time before the pioneers
came to explore and claim land for the United States. Sometimes the
meetings and interactions between the pioneers and Native Americans
were peaceful, and sometimes they were not.


Foundational Skills 6


 - Stop here in your review of the introduction. Tell students that they now have
an idea of the history and events leading up to the War of 1812. They will
review and discuss the remaining images in the introduction once they start
reading about the War of 1812.


~~**INTRODUCE THE TIMELINE (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Introduce the concept of a timeline. Point out the timeline wherever you
have decided to display it in the room. Explain that this is a way to organize
and visually represent historical events in the order in which the events took
place. (Students should already be familiar with the concept of timelines
through their work in the Knowledge lessons.)


 - Tell students that you are going to use images to represent the early history
of the United States and that they will help you place them on the timeline.


**Note:** At this time, you will only display Timeline Cards 1–10, 19, and 20
on the timeline. The remaining cards will be placed on the timeline during
subsequent lessons as students read about the events of the War of 1812.


 - Tell students that you will be showing them images that depict the same
period in history and the historical events that they just discussed while
examining the introduction in the Reader.


 - Shuffle Timeline Cards 1–10 and pass them out to groups of students.
Ask students to study the cards and be prepared to describe the image on
the card and come forward to place their card in the correct chronological
order on the timeline.


 - Point out the starting point on the timeline and the date _1492_ and ask if
anyone remembers what important event took place on this date. Ask
whoever has the image card of Christopher Columbus to come forward
and place the card on the timeline.


 - Encourage students to refer to the order that the images in the introduction
are arranged to determine which images come next.


 - Call on each group to place their card on the timeline. Lightly tape each card
to the timeline, as you may need to go back and rearrange the cards as more
cards are placed on the timeline. Once all cards have been placed and are
correct, tape the cards more securely to the timeline.

period of American history that students have studied earlier this year in
Knowledge. If students do not immediately recognize the images, point out
that these men were involved in the Civil War: Abraham Lincoln, the president
during the Civil War; Robert. E. Lee, a military leader for the Confederacy
(the South); and Ulysses S. Grant, a military leader for the Union (the North).


 - Tell students that you are going to place these cards at the end of this
particular timeline, and then tape the cards to the timeline.


   - Timeline Card 19 (Abraham Lincoln)


   - Timeline Card 20 (Grant and Lee sign documents to end the U.S. Civil War)


 - Close the lesson by pointing out that the timeline shows a series of events
in early American history. Point to the blank area of the timeline in which no
cards are taped, and ask if students can guess what events will be placed
here. _(War of 1812 events)_

**Show Image 1A-1: Colonists in the colonies**

From 1775 to 1783 America fought Great

Britain for independence. This conflict was

called the Revolutionary War. Against all odds,

America won! What had been the thirteen

original colonies officially became the United





States of America. After gaining independence,

the American people did not want kings or



queens governing them anymore. Americans wanted to create a new kind

of government. They wanted to be able to elect individuals to represent the

people and act with their best interests in mind. They wanted a government

that was “by the people, for the people.”

**Show Image 1A-4: Map of America in 1805**

For many years after the Revolutionary War,

the United States grew larger and wealthier.

New states, such as Vermont, Kentucky,

Tennessee, Ohio, and Louisiana, were added.

New territories were also settled. In 1803,

President Thomas Jefferson purchased the

Louisiana Territory from France. This purchase



more than doubled the size of the United States.

Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, France and

Britain went to war against each other.

This series of wars became known as the

Napoleonic [/nə*poe*lee*on*ik/] Wars, named





after the French leader at the time, Napoleon

Bonaparte. Napoleon Bonaparte wanted to



make France the most powerful nation in the world. Britain was determined

to stop him. The United States considered both France and

Great Britain to be its friends. It did not want to get involved in these costly

and destructive wars. Even though the Napoleonic Wars were being fought all

the way across the Atlantic Ocean, they greatly affected the United States.


Lesson 4 Reading: Informational Text
**55**


**Show Image 1A-6: Busy American port**

Much of the United States’ growth during this

time depended upon trade with France and

Great Britain. Britain and France had many

merchant, or trading, ships. These ships

sailed across the Atlantic to trade goods with

the United States, Canada, and with many of

the British- and French-owned islands in the



Caribbean. For example, the United States sent flour and tobacco to France

and Great Britain. Great Britain and France received sugar and coffee or

cocoa from other countries.


Both countries wanted to stop the other from trading with the United States.

They each also tried to prevent the other from getting money and supplies.

They also did not want the United States to choose sides.


**Show Image 1A-7: Map of shipping**
**trade routes**

To keep the French from trading with the

United States, the British blockaded, or

blocked, several U.S. ports. They also blocked

several important ports in Europe. This





seriously hurt U.S. trade. France and Britain

both had large naval fleets positioned in the



Atlantic Ocean to attack each other’s ships. To make matters worse, the

British and the French began to seize, or capture, American ships loaded with

valuable cargo. It became almost impossible to safely transport goods from

the United States to foreign ports. It was also more and more difficult for

Americans to receive much-needed goods.


**Show Image 1A-8: Impressment of sailors by**
**the British navy**

Merchant ships weren’t the only ships in the

sea! The United States and Great Britain also

had naval ships. Life in the British navy was

not easy. Conditions on their naval ships were





terrible. Because of this, the British navy had

a hard time finding men who wanted to be



**56**



sailors. To get more sailors, the British began to capture men from other

countries’ ships and force them to join the British navy. Sometimes these


Foundational Skills 6


sailors were British deserters. However, more times than not, the sailors who

were seized weren’t even British. But that did not stop the British from doing

it. They even seized many U.S. sailors. This practice of forcing men into the

British navy was called _impressment_ . Britain also resorted to impressment

because they had been involved in many conflicts and were spread thin.


**Show Image 1A-9: Naval ship USS President**

The impressment of U.S. citizens upset the

American people and the U.S. government.

As time went on, the United States found

that it was losing more and more valuable

cargo, sailors, money, and even ships. They





demanded that the British stop impressing

American sailors. But the British refused.



**Wrap-Up**

  - Tell students you will give them a Think-Pair-Share question. They should
think about the question, and then turn to a neighbor and discuss
the question.


  - Tell them that you will then call on several students to share what
was discussed.

have students stay seated and divide the class into teams by the manner in
which they are seated.)


  - Each team takes a “turn at bat” as follows:


    - Set a timer for ten minutes, and tell students that whichever team has the
most runs when the timer rings is the winning team. Point out that accuracy
is important, but so is speed in reading words quickly. The more turns that
players have to read words, the more likely their team is to score runs.


    - Pick a card from the pile, and ask the first person on the team to read it
aloud. If the word is read correctly, draw a line from home plate to first base,
signifying a “hit.” This player then goes to the back of his team’s line, while
the next player comes forward to read the next card. If they read the word
correctly, draw a line from first to second base. Play continues this way.


    - If the fourth player reads the word correctly, draw a line from third base to
home plate and mark “1 run” for the team.


    - Play continues for this team so long as no words are misread; when a word

**Preview Tricky Words**

  - You may wish to preview the following Tricky Words before reading
the chapter:


    - **Great Britain** —Students might expect to pronounce _Great_ as
/g/ /r/ /ee/ /t/ or even /g/ /r/ /e/ /t/, but the ‘ea’ is pronounced /ae/:
/g/ /r/ /ae/ /t/. They may think that _Britain_ is pronounced
/b/ /r/ /i/ /t/ /ae/ /n/. However, the correct pronunciation is
/b/ /r/ /i/ /t/ / _ə_ / /n/.


    - **Europe** —Students might expect to pronounce _Europe_ /e/ /er/ /oe/ /p/.
However, the correct pronunciation is /y/ /er/ / _ə_ / /p/.


    - **native** —Students might expect to pronounce _native_ as
/n/ /a/ /t/ /ie/ /v/, but it is pronounced /n/ /ae/ /t/ /i/ /v/.


    - **Americans** —Students might expect to pronounce _Americans_ as
/a/ /m/ /er/ /i/ /k/ /a/ /n/ /s/, but it is pronounced
/ _ə_ / /m/ /ae/ /r/ /i/ /k/ / _ə_ / /n/ /z/.


    - **war** —Students might expect to pronounce _war_ as /w/ /ar/ or /w/ /er/.
However, the correct pronunciation is /w/ /or/.


    - **signature** —Students might expect to pronounce _signature_ as
/s/ /i/ /g/ /n/ /a/ /t/ /er/. However, the correct pronunciation is
/s/ /i/ /g/ /n/ / _ə_ / /ch/ /er/.

- Assist students in decoding these words in the following way:


  - Write the vocabulary word on the board/chart paper.


  - Divide the word into syllables.


  - Cover one syllable at a time with your hand and segment the word.


Foundational Skills 6


   - Then, point to each syllable and ask students to “read it fast” to
signal them to read through the word.


   - Explicitly point out any unusual or challenging letter-sound
correspondences in any syllable, as well as one or two other
words with the same sound/spelling.


**Note:** Here are the vocabulary words divided into syllables for your
convenience, with any unusual letter-sound correspondences also noted.





~~**READ “TROUBLE WITH THE BRITISH” (20 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.9.D.i**~~


**Guided Reading Supports and Purpose for Reading**


**Note:** It is important that you stop frequently to ask students questions and
check for their understanding of the material, much in the same way you use
the Guided Listening Supports in Knowledge. It is critical that you clear up
any misunderstandings that students may have as you teach each chapter,
so that the misunderstandings do not compound over time.


You will introduce a new practice with this chapter as you model taking notes
on the board/chart paper after students read and discuss each set of pages.
Point out that many people find it helpful to make notes of important
information when they read nonfiction.


  - Be sure to call students’ attention to and discuss the images and captions
accompanying the text, as they often reinforce understanding.


  - Also, call students’ attention to the bolded vocabulary words in the chapter,
noting that they are included in the glossary.


  - Remind students that the glossary is at the end of the Reader. Point out
that all of the vocabulary words for the entire Reader are listed here in
one alphabetical list. To find the bolded vocabulary words for this chapter,


**TEKS 2.9.D.i** Recognize characteristics and structures of informational text, including the central idea and supporting
evidence with adult assistance.

**67**


**68**



students will need to look down the list and use their skills in alphabetizing.
As an example, the first vocabulary word for this chapter is _British_ .


 - Also point out that some words in the glossary have a word in parentheses
at the end of the definition. Note for students that the word in parentheses is
another form of the vocabulary word that appears in the Reader. For example,
the words _declare war_ and another form of it, _declaring war_, appear in the
same chapter together. In other cases, the word in parentheses appears in
the chapter but the vocabulary word does not, so students will have to look
closely to see which form of the word appears as they read.


 - Have students look at the words in the glossary that begin with the letter ‘d’
and find the words _declare war_ . The glossary can be used at any time to help
remind students of the meanings of new words. Encourage them to refer to it
when they are reading silently.


Pages 12 and 13


 - Read the title of the chapter together as a class, “Trouble with the British.”


 - Call students’ attention to the image of James Madison on **page 13** .


 - Have students read the caption on **page 13**, and point out that it describes
the image.


 - Tell students to always read captions to gain information.


 - Introduce the words _British_, _U.S. Congress_, and _declare war_ as
vocabulary words.


 - Note for students that _U.S._ is an abbreviation for _United States_ . They will see
this abbreviation throughout the Reader.


Check for Understanding


Ask students, “Where in the Reader could we find the definition of _British_ quickly?”

_(the glossary)_


 - Ask students to turn to the glossary and locate words that begin with the
letter ‘b’. Have them find the word _British_, and call on one student to read
the definition.


 - Redirect students’ attention to **page 12** . Have them locate the word _British_
on **page 12** .


Foundational Skills 6


 - Have students look up the words _U.S. Congress_ in the glossary and read the
definition together as a class.


 - Have students look up the words _declare war_ in the glossary, and read the
definition together as a class. Point out that the words _declaring war_ are
listed in parentheses at the end of the definition, indicating that students will
come across this form of the expression in the same chapter as _declare war._


 - Read **page 12** aloud as students follow along, asking them to listen for the
answer to the question: “What did Madison have to do?”


 - After reading aloud the page, restate the question and ask students to
answer. _(Madison had to decide what to do: ask the U.S. Congress to declare_
_war, or try to keep the peace.)_ Make sure students support their answer
with evidence from the text. Record the answer on the board/chart paper,
pointing out that you are making notes to help you remember the important
information in the chapter.


Pages 14 and 15


 - Tell students to read the first paragraph on **page 14** to themselves to find the
answer to the question: “What two countries in Europe were at war?”


 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer. ( _Britain and France_ ) Record the answer on the board/chart paper.


 - Tell students to read the second paragraph on **page 14** to themselves to find
the answer to the question: “Who led the French and what was he like?”


 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer. ( _Napoleon led the French and he was a brave leader._ )


 - Direct students’ attention to the image on **page 15**, and read the caption
aloud as a class.


Pages 16 and 17


 - Have students look in the glossary for the word _trader_, and read the definition
together as a class. Note the plural form of the word at the end of the
definition ( _traders_ ), and tell students they will see this form of the word in
the chapter instead of _trader_ . Note for students that _trader_ and _traders_ are
both nouns. Also note that students will see the verb forms of the word in this
chapter: _traded, trading_, and _trade_ .


 - Call on one student to read aloud the first two paragraphs on **page 16**, asking
students to listen for the answer to the question: “What did most Americans
think about this big war at first?”

Let’s read the first two paragraphs on **page 18** to find out.”


 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer. ( _They needed all the men they could get because some people quit_
_the navy and others ran away. They needed men so they could defeat_
_the French. Britain also resorted to impressment because they had been_
_involved in many conflicts and were spread thin._ ) Record the answer on the
board/chart paper.


 - Call on one student to read aloud the last paragraph on **page 18** .

              - Give each player five cards to start. Put the rest of the deck in the middle and
flip the top card over next to the deck. This faceup card becomes the
discard pile.


              - Taking turns, each student can either play a card that is the same color or
that starts with the same letter as the card at the top of the discard pile. To
be able to play a card, a student must correctly read the card or they lose
their turn.


              - If a student does not have a card that is either the same color or that starts
with the same letter as the top card of the discard pile, then they can draw
from the deck. If there are no more cards left in the deck, shuffle the discard
pile and that becomes the new deck.


              - The first student to run out of cards is the winner.

Foundational Skills 6


- Using the cards you prepared in advance, introduce each spelling word
by asking students to read the word on the index card, and to indicate the
r-controlled spelling in the word and the sound it stands for and into which
column it should be taped on the board/chart paper. (Some words apply to
more than one r-controlled spelling, so you will need to write those words in
their second columns. Those words are in parentheses in the sorted chart.)


- Ask students to use each word orally in a sentence to make sure they
understand the meaning of each word.

|‘ar’|‘er’|‘or’|‘ir’|‘ur’|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|barber<br>marker<br>parcel<br>ramparts<br>safari<br>war|after<br>(barber)<br>camera<br>difference<br>hamburger<br>(marker)<br>informer<br>perform|(informer)<br>organize<br>(perform)|birthday<br>swirling<br>thirteen<br>chirping|burden<br>furnace<br>(hamburger)<br>turtle|



- Introduce the Tricky Word _war_, explaining that this word has the spelling ‘ar’
but the letters ‘ar’ do not make the sound /ar/. Instead, they make the sound
/or/. Tape the word in the column for ‘ar’.


- Tell students that you will now rearrange the words and put them in
alphabetical order. Fold over the cards and paper clip them so that just the
first letter shows.


- Ask: “Do you see any words that begin with ‘a’? Yes, there is one word that
begins with ‘a’--after. This will be the first word. Do you see any letters
that started with ‘b’? Yes, there are three words that start with ‘b’-- _barber_,
_birthday_, and _burden_ . I will fold the cards over so I can see the second letter
just like we did last week. Now I see that ‘a’ comes before ‘i’ and ‘u’, so I will
put after first. Now I see that ‘i’ comes before ‘u’, so I will put _birthday_ next,
followed by _burden_ .


- Continue in this way through the cards.


- Unfold the cards and read the words aloud with students.


- Tell students that the words are now in alphabetical order.

When the Napoleonic Wars began in Europe, France and Great Britain

became enemies. The United States was caught in the middle. The U.S.

government really did not want to have to get involved. Merchants in New

England relied on trade with Britain to run their businesses. France had

helped America during the Revolutionary War. The United States wanted to

keep that friendship, too. However, when U.S. ships, cargo, and sailors were

being threatened—especially by the British—the United States could not

ignore it.


Check for Understanding


**Inferential.** Why do you think the United States wanted to have good relations with

Britain and France?


» Answers may vary, but could include that as a young nation, with a small army

and navy, they did not want to go to war. They also wanted to trade with both

Britain and France.


**Show Image 2A-5: Map of United States/**
**Canada/New Spain with flags**

You might think that what was happening at

sea was enough to drive the United States

to war with Great Britain. But, there were

even more problems on American land. Even





though Britain had lost the thirteen colonies

to America, it still had control of land in the



northern Great Lakes region, and the northwestern territories. Britain also

controlled part of what is now Canada. The British had forts and outposts

along the U.S. and Canadian border.

**Show Image 2A-6: Settlers in wagons**

Most Americans during this time were farmers.

Many, many settlers were moving west in

search of land to farm. Although the wagons

were on American land, the U.S. government

began to suspect that the British were





interfering with Americans who were settling

in the northern territories, especially in the



Ohio River Valley and the Indiana Territory. They believed that Britain was

using its outposts in Canada to help Native Americans who were fighting to

defend their land from the settlers.

them to read through the word.


    - Point out any unusual or challenging letter-sound correspondences in any
syllable, as well as one or two other words with the same sound/spelling.

any misunderstandings that students may have as you teach each chapter,
so the misunderstandings do not compound over time.


  - Remind students that as they read, they should try to identify the central
idea of the text as well as evidence that supports it.


  - Be sure to call students’ attention to and discuss the images and captions
accompanying the text, as they often reinforce understanding of the text.


  - Also, call students’ attention to the bolded vocabulary words in the chapter,
noting that they are included in the glossary.


  - Remind students that the glossary is at the end of the Reader. Point out
that all of the vocabulary words for the entire Reader are listed here in
one alphabetical list. To find the bolded vocabulary words for this chapter,
students will need to look down the list and use their skills in alphabetizing.
As an example, the first vocabulary word for this chapter is _merchant_ .


  - Also point out that some words in the glossary have a word in parentheses
at the end of the definition. Note for students that the word in parentheses is
another form of the vocabulary word that appears in the Reader. Sometimes,
the word in parentheses appears in the chapter but the vocabulary word
does not, so students will have to look closely to see which form of the word
appears as they read. For example, the word _merchants_ appears in the
chapter, but the word _merchant_ does not.


  - Have students look at the words in the glossary that begin with the letter
‘o’ and find the word _oppose_ . The glossary can be used at any time to help
remind students of the meanings of new words. Encourage them to refer
to it when they are reading silently.


Pages 24 and 25


  - Read the title of the chapter together as a class, “The War Hawks.”


  - Call students’ attention to the image of a busy urban street with merchants
on **page 25** .


  - Have students read the caption on **page 25**, and point out that it describes
the image.


  - Tell students to always read captions to gain information.


  - Introduce the words _merchant_ and _oppose_ as vocabulary words.


  - Ask, “Where in the Reader could we find the definition of _merchant_ quickly?”
_(the glossary)_


  - Ask students to turn to the glossary and locate words that begin with the
letter ‘m’. Have them find the word _merchant_, and call on one student to read
the definition. Note the plural form of the word _(merchants)_ at the end of the
definition, and tell students they will see this form of the word in the chapter
instead of _merchant_ .


Lesson 8 Reading and Spelling Alternatives: Informational Text and Introduce /er/ › ‘ar’, ‘or’
**97**


**98**




 - Have students look up the word _oppose_ in the glossary, and read the
definition together as a class. Note for students the past tense of the word
( _opposed_ ) at the end of the definition tells students they will see this form of
the word in the chapter instead of _oppose_ .


 - Read **page 24** aloud as students follow along, asking them to listen for the
answer to the question: “Why did some people not care to go to war?”


 - After reading aloud the page, restate the question and ask students to
answer. _(Most merchants and traders did not care to go to war because they_
_had homes in the cities along the East Coast and traded with Great Britain_
_as well as other countries. A war would mean less trade between countries,_
_sunken ships, and lost goods. A war would cost them money.)_ Record the
answer on the board/chart paper.


Pages 26 and 27


 - Tell students to read the first paragraph on **page 26** to themselves to find
the answers to the questions: “What group of people were not opposed to
war? Why?”


 - When students have finished reading, restate the questions and ask students
to answer. _(People who did not oppose war lived in the states out west and_
_were closer to Native American land. These settlers were afraid of Native_
_Americans and were angry with the British.)_ Record the answer on the
board/chart paper.


 - Tell students to read the second paragraph on **page 26** to themselves to find
the answer to the question: “What were these people called?”


 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer. _(They were called War Hawks.)_ Record the answer on the board/
chart paper.


 - Direct students’ attention to the image on **page 27**, and have students
describe what the image shows.


Pages 28 and 29


 - Call on one student to read aloud **page 28**, asking students to listen for the
answer to the question: “How did War Hawks tell Congress they should go
to war?”


 - After the student finishes reading aloud, restate the question and ask
students to answer. _(They made angry speeches before Congress.)_
Record the answer on the board/chart paper.


 - Direct students’ attention to the image and caption on **page 29**, and call on
one student to read the caption aloud. Note for students that this is an image
of Henry Clay, who was a War Hawk.


Foundational Skills 6


**Wrap-Up**

 - Direct students’ attention to the notes you recorded while reading. Read the
notes aloud as a class.


 - Ask students if there is additional information that should be added to

Congress should declare war, there were others who felt war should not
be declared.


**Note:** Keep the notes on display for use in the next lesson.

- Point to the /er/ Tree. Remind students that they have learned three different
ways to spell /er/: ‘er’ as in _her_ ; ‘ur’ as in _hurt_ ; and ‘ir’ as in _bird_ . Point to several
leaves on the different branches, asking students to rapidly read the words.


- Explain that students will learn two new spellings today for /er/: ‘ar’ and ‘or’.
Turn to **page 18** of the **Vowel Code Flip Book**, and put the Spelling Cards on
the appropriate spaces. Discuss the power bars.


- Tell students that today’s letter-sound correspondences can be found on

- Hand out the blue markers. Have students turn to **page 10** of the **Individual**
**Code Chart** . Guide students in outlining the appropriate card on the chart
as well as the spelling.


- Attach the two new branches to the /er/ Tree.


- Shuffle the leaves you prepared with the ‘or’ and ‘ar’ spellings.


- Hold up one of the leaves you prepared and call on a student to read the
word and identify the spelling for /er/. Have the student tape the leaf to
the appropriate branch.


- Have students look at the Individual Code Chart. Ask students which of the
spellings they have learned for / _er_ / has the longer power bar. _(‘er’)_ Explain
that ‘or’ is used as a spelling for /er/ in more words than ‘ar’, but that ‘er’ is
used as a spelling for /er/ in more words than the other spellings.


- Remind students that they have already encountered the spellings ‘ar’ and
‘or’ in association with other sounds, ‘ar’ as /ar/ and ‘or’ as /or/. Write the
following words on the board/chart paper and ask students to read them.
Remind students that they can use what they know about syllable types and
chunking to read and spell multisyllabic words. Use car•pet as an example of
how to use the VCCV pattern to chunk and read a word.

 - Help students realize that when they see a word with an ‘ar’ or ‘or’ spelling, they
may need to sound out the word with alternate sounds, ‘ar’ as /ar/ or /er/ and
‘or’ as /or/ or /er/, to see which sound makes sense in a given instance.


**Note:** The Tricky Word _wizard_ can now be seen as part of a larger spelling
pattern. It should be removed from your Tricky Word Wall if you have one.

**Note:** It is suggested that you be lenient when assessing student performance on

this activity page. Some students may say that they hear the /or/ sound in _favor_ or

the /ar/ sound in _beggar_ . That is okay. It is more important that students realize that

the spellings ‘or’ and ‘ar’ can be pronounced different ways than to classify each word

correctly. Students may need to try more than one pronunciation to successfully

decode ‘or’ and ‘ar’ words. They will have additional opportunities to practice this in

the Tricky Spelling exercises later in the unit.

**Find the Words**

 - Make a copy of **Activity Page TR 8.1** for each student.


 - Have students highlight or circle the r-controlled vowels in the sentence.


 - Then have students read the sentences aloud with a partner.


 - At the bottom of the activity page or on a separate piece of paper, have
students write three column headers: ‘or’, ‘er’, and ‘ar’. Have them list the words
with r-controlled vowels that they circled under the appropriate header.


**Checkers**

 - Provide each pair of students with a copy of the checkerboard **(Activity**
**Page TR 8.2)**, checker pieces **(Activity Page TR 8.3)**, and a set of word
cards **(Activity Page TR 8.4)** .


 - The rules are the same as regular checkers except that in order to make
a move, the student must first draw and read a word card correctly. If the
student reads the card correctly, then they may make a move. If the student
misreads the word, the turn is lost.


 - The first player to take all of the other player’s pieces is the winner.


**Code Knowledge**


Before today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average 860–933
of those words would be completely decodable.


After today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average 877–935 of
those words would be completely decodable.


The spelling ‘ar’ is fairly tricky. It can be pronounced /ar/ as in _car_, /ae/ + /r/ as in
_parents_, /er/ as in _dollar_, or /or/ as in _warm_ . The letters ‘ar’ can also be part of larger
spelling units, as they are in _heard_ and _roar_, or they can be parts of two separate
spellings, as they are in _stare_ and _hear_ .


The spelling ‘or’ can be pronounced /or/ as in _fort_ or /er/ as in _work_ .

**Primary Focus**
Students will spell dictated words with r-controlled vowel patterns and the
Tricky Word _war_ and will write four of the words in alphabetical order.


~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii; TEKS 2.2.D**~~


Students will complete written sentences by adding a predicate to each subject
and will identify the subject and predicate in each sentence. ~~**TEKS 2.11.D.i**~~


~~**SPELLING ASSESSMENT (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 10.1.


  - Before starting the spelling assessment, encourage students to write the
words in cursive.


  - Read the first spelling word, use it in a sentence, and then read the word once
more, allowing students sufficient time to write the word.


  - Repeat this procedure with each of the remaining words.



Activity Page 10.1








  - Direct students’ attention to the lines on the back of the activity page. Tell
students to write the sentence “The War Hawks wanted to go to war.” Slowly
repeat this sentence three times.


  - At the end, go back through the list and read each spelling word one more time.


**TEKS 2.2.B.iii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open
syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables;

- After all the words have been called out, tell students that you will now show
them the correct spelling for each word so they can correct their own work.


- Say and write each word on the board/chart paper, instructing students to
correct their work by crossing out any incorrect spelling, then copying and
writing the correct spelling next to it.


- Continue through all the words and then on to the sentence.


- Circle the following words on the board/chart paper. Ask students to write
the words in alphabetical order on the back of the activity page:








- After all students have finished, write the four words in alphabetical order for
students to correct their papers.

At a later time, use the template provided in Teacher Resources to analyze students’

mistakes. This will help you understand any patterns that are beginning to develop or

that are persistent among individual students.


~~**COMPLETE VS. INCOMPLETE SENTENCES (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students that the subject of a sentence tells who or what the
sentence is about. For example, in the sentence _The little boy smiled happily._,
the subject is _The_ _little boy_ because that is who the sentence is about.


 - Remind students that the predicate of a sentence describes what the subject
is or does. In the previous sentence, the predicate is _smiled happily_ because
that is what the subject did.


Foundational Skills 6


 - Tell students that every sentence needs to have a subject and a predicate.
If either the subject or the predicate is missing, it is an incomplete sentence
(also known as a sentence fragment).


 - Write the following incomplete sentence on the board/chart paper:
_The crying babies._ Explain that this is an incomplete sentence because
it is missing a predicate (i.e., it does not say what the crying babies did).


 - Now write the following incomplete sentence on the board/chart paper:
_wanted their bottles._ Explain that this is an incomplete sentence because
it is missing a subject (i.e., it does not say who wanted their bottles).


 - Point out that you can combine these two incomplete sentences—one of
which is a subject and the other a predicate—to make a complete sentence:
_The crying babies wanted their bottles._ Write this sentence on the board/
chart paper, prompting students to direct you to draw one line under the
subject and two lines under the predicate to “prove” that the sentence
is complete.


 - Uncover what you wrote on the board/chart paper and direct students’
attention to it:


   - Subject + Predicate = Complete Sentence


 - Explain that a complete sentence always has both a subject and a predicate.


Check for Understanding


Pair students to create their own sentence. Ask them to identify the subject

and predicate.


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 10.2.


 - Work with students to complete the first sentence by adding a predicate.


 - Have students complete the remaining sentences independently.


 - When students are finished with the front of the activity page, have them
turn to the back of the activity page.


 - Work with students to complete the first sentence by adding a subject.


 - Have students complete the remaining sentences independently.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


In this lesson, you will teach a spelling alternative for the /k/ sound: ‘ch’ as in
_school_ . Students should already know the basic code spelling ‘c’ as in _cat_ and
the spelling alternatives ‘k’ as in _kid_, ‘ck’ as in _black_, and ‘cc’ as in _hiccup_ . The
spelling ‘ch’ is likely to be unfamiliar to many students, although some may
have learned to decode this spelling during independent reading. The following
chart shows you which of these spellings are most common for this sound.





**122**



Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


 - The spelling ‘ **c** ’ is found at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of
syllables ( _cat, act, attic_ ).


 - The spelling ‘ **k** ’ is found at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of
syllables ( _kite, skin, cook_ ).


 - The spelling ‘ **ck** ’ is found at the end of syllables, after short vowel sounds
( _back, slick, rocking_ ).


 - The spelling ‘ **cc** ’ is always found in the middle of words ( _raccoon, soccer_ ).


 - The spelling ‘ **ch** ’ is found at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of
syllables ( _chaos, scholar, stomach_ ).

~~**READ “THE WAR STARTS” (20 MIN.)**~~


**Guided Reading Supports and Purpose for Reading**

**Note:** It is important that you stop frequently to ask students questions and
check for their understanding of the material, much in the same way you use
the Guided Listening Supports in Knowledge. It is critical that you clear up
any misunderstandings that students may have as you teach each chapter,
so the misunderstandings do not compound over time.


 - Be sure to call students’ attention to and discuss the images and captions
accompanying the text, as they often reinforce understanding of the text.


 - Also, call students’ attention to the bolded vocabulary words in the chapter,
noting that they are included in the glossary.


 - Remind students that they can also use what they know about the structure
of chronological order to make predictions about informational texts.


Pages 30 and 31


 - Read the title of the chapter together as a class, “The War Starts.”


 - The author uses a chronological text structure in this chapter. Based on what
you know about this structure, what do you predict you will learn about?


 - Tell students to read **page 30** to themselves to find the answer to the
question: “Who did Madison end up siding with, and what did that mean?”


 - When students have finished reading, restate the questions and ask students
to answer. _(In the end, Madison sided with the War Hawks and that meant he_
_asked Congress to declare war.)_


 - Ask, “Why did Americans think they would have a better chance of winning?”
_(The British were already at war with France and could only send some of their_
_troops to fight the United States.)_


 - Direct students’ attention to the image on **page 31** .


Pages 32 and 33


 - Have students find the word _monarchy_ in the glossary, and call on one
student to read the definition aloud.


 - Tell students to read the first two paragraphs on **page 32** to themselves to
find the answer to the question: “How was the United States in 1812 different
from how it is today?”


 - Ask: Was your prediction correct? If not, how has your thinking changed?


 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer. _(In 1812, the United States was not very old as a country. Today, it is_
_a strong nation and has been around for many years.)_


Foundational Skills 6


 - Say, “I wonder how the United States was different from Great Britain in 1812.
Let’s read the rest of **page 32** to find out.”


 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer. _(The United States had a different kind of government. At the time,_
_most nations in Europe were monarchies. A king or queen ruled until he or she_
_died, and then the oldest son or daughter took over. The United States had a_
_president chosen by voters instead. When voters picked a new president, the_
_old one had to step down.)_


 - Direct students’ attention to the image on **page 33**, and read the caption
aloud as a class.


Pages 34 and 35


 - Have students find the word _fort_ in the glossary, and read the definition
together as a class. Note for students that the plural form of the word listed
after the definition, _forts_, appears in this chapter instead of the word _fort._


 - Tell students to read the first paragraph on **page 34** . Ask: Based on the
information provided in this paragraph, what do you predict the rest of page
34 will be about?


 - Tell students to read the second paragraph to find the answer to the question:
“How would you describe the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy in 1812?”


 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer. _(The United States had an army and a navy that were tiny.)_


 - Say, “I wonder what President Madison did about the tiny army. Let’s read
the rest of page 34 to find out.” Give students time to read.


 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer. _(Madison found a way to make it bigger by getting farmers to join.)_


 - Ask, “What was the problem with the army?” _(The soldiers were not well_
_trained, and the army was not ready for war.)_


 - **Turn and Talk:** Was your prediction correct? If not, how has your thinking
changed?


 - Have students read the caption on **page 35** and look at the image.


Pages 36 and 37


 - Tell students to read **page 36** to themselves to find the answer to the
question: “What happened with the navy?”


 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer. _(Nobody expected much from the navy, but things went better with_
_the navy than with the army. The navy beat the British in some naval battles.)_


 - Direct students’ attention to the image on **page 37** .

~~**INTRODUCE SPELLING WORDS**~~


  - Write the following spellings on the board/chart paper as columns and review
the sound associated with each spelling, noting that they typically occur at the
end of words: ‘ge’, ‘dge’, and ‘tion’.


**TEKS 2.2.B.iii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open
syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables;
**TEKS 2.2.D** Alphabetize a series of words and use a dictionary or glossary to find words; **TEKS 2.2.C.i** Demonstrate and
apply spelling knowledge by spelling one-syllable and multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe syllables;
vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables.

Foundational Skills 6


- Remind students that they can use what they have learned about open
syllables (or syllables that end in long vowel sounds) to read and spell the
words. Point out the /ae/ sound in na•tion and the /ee/ sound in _re•venge_ .










  - Using the cards you prepared in advance, introduce each spelling word by
asking students to read the word on the index card, and to indicate in which
column the card should be taped. Use each word in a sentence to illustrate
its meaning.

|‘ge’|‘dge’|‘tion’|
|---|---|---|

  - Introduce the Tricky Word _Europe_, explaining that this is the name of a
continent; France and Great Britain are part of Europe. Tape the word
next to the sorted chart.


Lesson 11 Reading: Informational Text
**131**


- Tell students that you will now put the words in alphabetical order. Fold over
the cards and paper clip them so just the first letter shows as you did in
Lessons 1 and 6.


- Ask: “Do you see any words that begin with ‘a’? Yes, I have THREE words that
begin with ‘a’. I wonder how we know which one to put first. Let me unfold
one more letter. (Fold the cards so the ‘ad’, ‘ac’, and ‘at’ are visible.) Oh, I see.
‘c’ comes before ‘d’, so I will put the word that starts with ‘ac’— _action_ before
the word that starts with ‘ad’— _addition_, followed by the word that starts with
‘at’— _attention_ . So I now have the first three words, all starting with the letter
‘a’ in the correct alphabetical order. Now, do you see any words starting with
‘b’? No. ‘c’? Yes, I have THREE cards again.” Proceed in this way until all cards
have been alphabetized.


- Unfold the cards, and read the words aloud with students.


- Tell students that the words are now in alphabetical order.

- Tell students that the words will remain on display until the assessment so
that they may refer to them during the week.

  - After students have finished reading “The War Starts” with their partners,
lead students in a purposeful re-reading of the text by doing the following:


    - asking text-dependent questions that require students to draw on
evidence from the text;

    - identifying and discussing general academic (Tier 2) vocabulary;

    - discussing sections of the text that might pose difficulty due to complex
syntax, dense information, challenging transitions, or that require inferences;
and

    - engaging students in a culminating writing activity that is completed
independently, if possible.


  - There are many ways for students to respond to the questions you present,
and you may want to change the way in which you ask for students’ responses
in each lesson or even during the lesson to improve student engagement. For
this lesson, have students work as partners. Following each question, direct
students to consult with their partner about the correct response, before one

joined together, or run together, without appropriate punctuation.


 - Uncover the first sentence you prepared in advance, leaving the second
sentence covered, and direct students’ attention to it.

 - Explain that one way of fixing a run-on sentence is to break the run-on
sentence into two separate sentences by using appropriate punctuation
and capitalization. The example could be rewritten as _The ducks quacked._
_The chickens clucked._


 - Point out that another way to correct a run-on sentence is to combine the thoughts
of the two sentences to make just one sentence. The example could be rewritten as
_The ducks quacked, and the chickens clucked._

or adverb, and then what that card could be describing. For example, if they
had the adverb _excitedly_, they might come up with a word or phrase like
_jumped on the trampoline_ .


  - Give them time to create a picture to go with their adjective/adverb phrase/

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


Students already know the basic code spelling ‘ee’ as in _bee_ as well as the
spelling alternatives ‘ea’ as in _beach_, ‘ie’ as in _cookie_, ‘e_e’ as in _Pete_, ‘e’ as in
_me_, ‘y’ as in _funny_, and ‘ey’ as in _key_ for the sound /ee/. Today they will learn
‘i’ as in _ski_ . The following chart shows you which of these spellings are most
common for this sound.


Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


  - /ee/ is one of the hardest sounds to spell because there are so
many alternatives.


  - Although ‘ **ee** ’ is not the most common spelling, it is used as the basic
code spelling because it is the only common spelling that is almost always
pronounced /ee/. Several of the other spellings can be pronounced several
different ways and are tricky spellings.


  - ‘ **ee** ’ and ‘ **ea** ’ are used in many one-syllable words, most often followed by a
consonant spelling ( _jeep, peek, peak, heap_ ).


  - ‘ **e_e** ’ can be seen as a variation of the basic code spelling ‘ee’ in which the
two ‘e’s are separated by a consonant spelling.


  - ‘ **ey** ’ is found primarily at the end of a word or syllable.


  - ‘ **y** ’ is generally used at the end of words; it is used in suffixes to mark
adjectives ( _funny, silly_ ) and adverbs ( _slowly, quickly_ ).


  - The ‘ **y** ’ ending in many words changes to ‘i’ when a suffix that begins with a
vowel is added: _funny_   - _funnier_, _sunny_   - _sunniest_ .


Lesson 13 Spelling Alternatives and Tricky Spelling: Introduce /ee/ › ‘i’ and Tricky Spelling ‘i’
**149**


**150**




 - The ‘ **y** ’ ending in many words changes to ‘ie’ when _–s_ is added (either to mark
a plural or show a change in person): _puppy_   - _puppies_, _lady_   - _ladies_, _I carry_   _he carries_ .


 - The ‘ **y** ’ spelling also changes when _–ed_ is added: _carry_  - _carried_,
_rally_   - _rallied_ .


 - There are two spellings for the /ee/ sound that will not be taught in Grade 2:
‘ **ei** ’ as in _either_ and ‘ **i_e** ’ as in _machine_ .


 - There are five spellings for /ee/ that are used either exclusively or almost
exclusively in multisyllable words: ‘ **y** ’ as in _funny_, ‘ **i** ’ as in _radio_, ‘ **ey** ’ as in
_monkey_, ‘ **i_e** ’ as in _machine_, and ‘ **e** ’ as in _prefix_ (with the exception of a
handful of high-frequency words: _be, she, we, he, me_ ).


 - The spelling ‘ **i** ’ is the only spelling that regularly appears before another
vowel spelling: _accordion, historian, funniest, interior, radio, piano_ .


**Foundational Skills**

 - You may wish to tab Vowel Code Flip Book page 9 for Introduce /ee/ > ‘i’.
Also have the Spelling Card listed in the Lesson at a Glance chart, student
Individual Code Charts, and green markers readily available.


 - Create a new branch for the /ee/ Spelling Tree for the spelling ‘i’.


 - Create the following leaves for the /ee/ Spelling Tree: _ski, taxi, pizza, radio,_
_medium, piano, happiness, heavier, easier_, and _easiest_ .

 - Create an enlarged version of Activity Page 13.1 (Digital Component 13.1)
to display for Tricky Spelling ‘i’, or use the digital version.


Foundational Skills 6


**Start Lesson**



**Lesson 13: “A Famous Ship”**
Reading



30M



**Primary Focus:** Students will read “A Famous Ship” with purpose and
understanding, will utilize text features such as the table of contents to locate
chapters and the glossary to clarify the meaning of words, and will answer written
multiple-choice questions about key details in the text.


~~**TEKS 2.6.E; TEKS 2.6.G; TEKS 2.9.D.ii**~~


~~**INTRODUCE THE CHAPTER (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students to briefly summarize “The War Starts.” Prompt students to
recall that although both the U.S. Army and Navy were very small, the U.S.
Navy had some success in beating the British in several naval battles.


  - Ask students to turn to **page 8** in their Reader.


  - Remind students that they have already learned about some of the causes
of the War of 1812. These include the British impressment of Americans to
become sailors in the British Navy; the British Navy blocked American ships
and prevented them from trading with the French; the United States had a
desire for westward expansion, and there was conflict with Native Americans;
the British were trading with Native Americans; etc.


  - Tell students that the images on **pages 8** **and** **9** of the introduction will help
them gain a better understanding of what war in 1812 was like.

    - **USS Constitution** —This image shows the USS _Constitution_, an American
warship. Many of the battles of the War of 1812 occurred at sea between
the American and British navies. Point out the masts and sails. Ask
students if they know the purpose of the sails. _(to move the ship)_

    - **Modern battleship** —Compare the image of the current battleship to the
USS _Constitution_ . Note the lack of sails, the difference of materials (metal
vs. wood), and the antennae and radio equipment on the modern ship.
Explain that ships in the U.S. Navy today are very different from the USS
_Constitution_ ; modern warships can even have fighter jets land on them or
go below the surface of the sea as submarines.

    - **Cannon from the 1800s** —This kind of weapon was used in the War of
1812 battles by both the army and navy. This cannon is on wheels, which
allowed soldiers to move it around to battlefields. A cannon would be filled
with gunpowder, and a cannonball would then be placed inside the cannon.
The cannonball would then shoot out of the cannon toward the enemy.


**TEKS 2.6.E** Make connections to personal experiences, ideas in other texts, and society; **TEKS 2.6.G** Evaluate details read
to determine key ideas; **TEKS 2.9.D.ii** Recognize characteristics and structures of informational text, including features and
graphics to locate and gain information.

Lesson 13 Spelling Alternatives and Tricky Spelling: Introduce /ee/ › ‘i’ and Tricky Spelling ‘i’
**151**


   - **19th-century soldiers** —Discuss the uniforms and equipment of the
19th-century (1800s) soldiers. There are a few soldiers on horseback in
the background. Remind students that soldiers in the army fought on land,
either on foot or on horseback.


 - Tell students that the title of today’s chapter is “A Famous Ship.”


 - Ask students to turn to the table of contents, locate the chapter, and then
turn to the first page of the chapter.


**Preview Tricky Word**

 - You may wish to preview the following Tricky Word before reading the chapter.


   - **iron** —Students are likely to pronounce this word /ee/ /r/ /o/ /n/, given
the recent instruction in the sound of the spelling ‘i’ as /ee/, or /er/ /o/
/n/. However, point out that the actual pronunciation is /ie/ /er/ /n/.


**Preview Core Vocabulary**

 - Preview specific vocabulary immediately before students are asked to
read the page(s) on which they first appear. The page number where each
word first appears in “A Famous Ship” is listed after the definition. A word in
parentheses after the definition is another form of the vocabulary word that
appears in the chapter.


**document—n.,** an official or important paper (40)


**branch—n.,** one of three major parts of the government (40)


**Supreme Court—n.,** the highest court of law in the United States (40)


**string—n.,** a series (42)


**mast—n.,** the tall pole on a ship to which the sails are attached (masts) (42)


**plank—n.,** a long, thick board (planks) (42)

 - Assist students in decoding these words in the following way:

   - Write the vocabulary word on the board.

   - Divide the word into syllables.

   - Cover one syllable at a time with your hand, and segment the word.

   - Then, point to each syllable and ask students to “read it fast” to signal
them to read through the word.

   - Explicitly point out any unusual or challenging letter-sound
correspondences in any syllable, as well as one or two other words with the
same sound/spelling.


**Note:** Here are the vocabulary words divided into syllables for your convenience,
with any unusual letter-sound correspondences also noted.





~~**READ “A FAMOUS SHIP” (20 MIN.)**~~


**Guided Reading Supports and Purpose for Reading**


**Note:** It is important that you stop frequently to ask students questions and
check for their understanding of the material, much in the same way you use
the Guided Listening Supports in Knowledge. It is critical that you clear up
any misunderstandings that students may have as you teach each chapter,
so the misunderstandings do not compound over time.


  - Be sure to call students’ attention to and discuss the images and captions
accompanying the text, as they often reinforce understanding of the text.


  - Also, call students’ attention to the bolded vocabulary words in the chapter,
noting that they are included in the glossary.


Pages 38 and 39


  - Read the title of the chapter together as a class, “A Famous Ship.”


  - Call students’ attention to the image of a ship on **page 39** .


  - Help students read the caption on **page 39**, and point out that it describes
the image.

Pages 40 and 41


 - Introduce the words _document, branch,_ and _Supreme Court_ as
vocabulary words.


 - Ask students, “Where in the Reader could we find the definition of _document_
quickly?” _(the glossary)_


 - Ask students to turn to the glossary and locate words that begin with the
letter ‘d’. Have them find the word _document_, and call on one student to read
the definition.


 - Redirect students’ attention to **page 40** . Have them locate the word
_document_ on **page 40** .


 - Have students look up the words _branch_ and _Supreme Court_ in the glossary
and read the definitions together as a class.


 - Have students read the first paragraph on **page 40** to themselves to find the
answer to fill in the blank in the sentence: “The is the document that
lays out the laws of the land.”


 - When students have finished reading, reread the sentence and have students
fill in the blank. ( _The Constitution is the document that lays out the laws of the_
_land._ ) Record the answer on the board/chart paper.


 - Have students read the second paragraph of **page 40** to themselves to find
the answer to the question: “Why did the people of the United States name
one of their fighting ships after the Constitution?”


 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and have students
answer. ( _The people of the United States were proud of the Constitution, so_
_they named one of their fighting ships the USS_ Constitution _._ )


 - Direct students’ attention to the image on **page 41** .


Pages 42 and 43


 - Have students look up _string_ and _mast_ in the glossary, and read the
definitions together as a class. Note for students that the plural form
of _mast_ is used in this chapter, _masts_ .


Foundational Skills 6


 - Call on several students to read the seven paragraphs on **page 42** out loud
while the class listens for the answer to the question: “Why did American
sailors say that the USS _Constitution’s_ sides were made of iron?”


 - When students have finished reading the page, restate the question and ask
students to answer. _(During the battles, some cannonballs bounced off the thick_
_walls of the USS_ Constitution _.)_ Record the answer on the board/chart paper.


 - Ask, “Did the same thing happen to the British ships?” _(no)_


 - Direct students’ attention to the image on **page 43** .

complete fill-in-the-blank sentences with words featuring the tricky spelling ‘i’.





**168**



~~**REVIEW TRICKY SPELLING ‘I’ (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that in a previous lesson they learned a new way to spell the
/ee/ sound as ‘i’. Have students read all of the words on the /ee/ Tree that are
spelled with ‘i’.


  - Shuffle the new leaves that you prepared for the /ee/ Tree. Have students
read all the words aloud as a class.


  - Call on an individual student to tell you the spelling of the /ee/ sound in each
word. Have another student circle the letter and a third student tape the
word to the Spelling Tree.


  - Now, remind students that they also know two other sounds for ‘i’, /i/and
/ie/, so ‘i’ is a tricky spelling.


  - Direct students’ attention to the graphic for tricky spelling ‘i’ that you
prepared in advance. Remind students that they can use what they know
about syllable types and chunking to read and spell multisyllabic words. Use
_pizz•a_ as an example of how to use the VCV pattern to chunk and read a
word. Point out that in this case, ‘zz’ makes one consonant sound, /z/, rather
than two separate sounds.


**TEKS 2.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (i) decoding words with short, long, or variant vowels, trigraphs,
and blends; (v) decoding words using knowledge of syllable division patterns such as VCCV, VCV, and VCCCV; **TEKS 2.2.C**
Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling one-syllable and multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open
syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables; (iv)
spelling multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns.

**Guided Reading Supports and Purpose for Reading**


**Note:** It is important that you stop frequently to ask students questions and
check for their understanding of the material, much in the same way you use
the Guided Listening Supports in Knowledge. It is critical that you clear up
any misunderstandings that students may have as you teach each chapter,
so the misunderstandings do not compound over time.


  - Be sure to call students’ attention to and discuss the images and captions
accompanying the text, as they often reinforce understanding of the text.


  - Also, call students’ attention to the bolded vocabulary words in the chapter,
noting that they are included in the glossary.

 - Next, remind students that an apostrophe in a word can indicate a
contraction, taking the place of letters to combine two words into one, such
as in _can’t_ . It can also be apostrophe ‘s’ at the end of a word that shows
ownership; the person, or owner, owns something.

  - After students have finished reading “The Attack on Washington, D.C.” with
their partners, lead students in a purposeful re-reading of the text by doing the
following:


    - asking text-dependent questions that require students to draw on
evidence from the text;

    - identifying and discussing general academic (Tier 2) vocabulary;

    - discussing sections of the text that might pose difficulty due to complex
syntax, dense information, challenging transitions, or that require inferences;
and

    - engaging students in a culminating writing activity that is completed
independently, if possible.


  - There are many ways for students to respond to the questions you present,
and you may want to change the way in which you ask for students’
responses in each lesson or even during the lesson to improve student
engagement. For this lesson, have students work as partners. Following each
question, direct students to consult with their partner about the correct
response, before one student raises his or her hand to respond.

sentence illustrating its meaning.


- Tell students that you will now put the words in alphabetical order. Fold over
the cards and paper clip them so just the first letter shows as you did in
previous lessons. Randomly tape the cards to the board/chart paper.


- Ask: “Do you see any words that begin with ‘a’? No. ‘b’? Yes, I have two words
that begin with ‘b’. I wonder how we know which one to put first. Let me
unfold one more letter. (Fold the cards so the ‘ba’ and ‘Br’ are visible.) Oh, I
see. ‘a’ comes before ‘r’, so I will put the word that starts with ‘ba’— _battle_  before the word that starts with ‘Br’– _British_ . ‘c’? Yes, I have two words that
begin with ‘c’. I wonder how we know which one to put first. Let me unfold one
more letter. (Fold the cards so the ‘ca’, ‘Co’ are visible.) Oh, I see. ‘a’ comes
before ‘o’, so I will put the word that starts with ‘ca’— _cannon_ —before the word
that starts with ‘Co’— _Congress_ .” Proceed in this way until all cards have been

Support


Note for students the two
words _Capitol_ and _capital_ .
Tell students that the word
_Capitol_, with a capital
letter ‘C’ and the letters
‘tol’ refers to the Capitol
building, where Congress
meets or where a state
government meets. The
word _capital_ with a lowercase ‘c’ and the letters ‘tal’
refers to the capital city,
which is where the main
government offices
are located.

~~**BUILD SENTENCES**~~


  - Remind students that they have been talking about complete and incomplete
sentences; they have learned that a complete sentence must always have a
subject and a predicate.


  - Tell students that today they are going to learn how to build or write
interesting sentences.


  - Direct students’ attention to the sentence you prepared in advance.


    - They went on Tuesday.


  - Ask students whether this is a complete or incomplete sentence. Then ask
them to help “prove” that the sentence is complete by identifying the subject
and the predicate. Underline the subject with a single line and the predicate
with a double line.


  - Point out that although this is a complete sentence, it is a very simple
sentence that does not provide very much information and is not
very interesting.


  - Write the following column headings on the board/chart paper: “Who?,”
“Where?,” “Why?”.


  - Pointing to the subject _They_, ask, “Who is meant by _They_ ?” Record any
possible answers under the heading “Who?”.


  - Have students choose one of the responses you recorded and use it to write
a revised sentence (e.g., _Joyce and Mark went on Tuesday._ ).


  - Ask students to again identify the subject. Point out that in rewriting the
sentence, you added information to the subject.

and “Why?”. Alternatively you could use three separate sheets of chart paper,
labeling each one.


  - Share with students one of the images you gathered in advance.


  - Ask students to determine who (subject), is doing what (predicate).
Record the answer to “Who?” on the chart.


  - Then, have students add details by answering the questions “Where?”
and “Why?” related to the image.


  - Once they have answered, ask them to write a sentence including that
information, and then go back and code the subject and predicate.


  - This could be repeated as partners or independently.

assign one point for one-syllable words, two points for two-syllable words,
three points for three-syllable words, and so on.


  - Each player gets a preset time limit to attempt to read as many words

header each card goes. Tape the card under the appropriate header.


  - Sort the rest of the words as students read them during the Baseball Game.


~~**BASEBALL GAME (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that today they will review the different schwa spellings they
studied in Unit 5.


  - Thoroughly shuffle the cards that you have prepared.


  - Remind students that they can use what they know about syllable types and
chunking to read and spell multisyllabic words. Use _nos•tril_ as an example of
how to use the VCCCV pattern to chunk and read a word.


  - Divide the class into two teams, having one team at a time come to the front
of the room and line up in front of the board/chart paper. (You may choose to
have students stay seated and divide the class into teams by the manner in
which they are seated.) Each team takes a “turn at bat” as follows:

    - Pick a card from the pile, and ask the first person on the team to read it
aloud, while you tape it in the correct column on the board/chart paper.
If the word is read correctly, draw a line from home plate to first base,
signifying a “hit.” This player then goes to the back of his team’s line, while
the next player comes forward to read the next card. If they read the word
correctly, draw a line from first to second base.


    - Play continues this way. If the fourth player reads the word correctly, draw
a line from third base to home plate, and mark “1 run” for the team. Play
continues for this team so long as no words are misread; when a word is
misread, the next team takes its turn at bat.


**TEKS 2.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (iii) decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open
syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables;
(v) decoding words using knowledge of syllable division patterns such as VCCV, VCV, and VCCCV.

    - Set a timer for 10 minutes, and tell students that whichever team has the
most runs when the timer rings is the winning team. Point out that accuracy
is important, but so is speed in reading words quickly. The more turns that
players have to read words, the more likely their team is to score runs.

**Note:** It is important that you stop frequently to ask students questions and
check for their understanding of the material, much in the same way you use
the Guided Listening Supports in Knowledge. It is critical that you clear up
any misunderstandings that students may have as you teach each chapter,
so the misunderstandings do not compound over time.


 - Be sure to call students’ attention to and discuss the images and captions
accompanying the text, as they often reinforce understanding of the text.


 - Also, call students’ attention to the bolded vocabulary words in the chapter,
noting that they are included in the glossary.

  - Tell students that this week all of the words are unit-specific words. That means
that all of the words have something to do with the Reader _The War of 1812_ .


  - Remind students that they can use what they have learned about VCe syllables
to read and spell the words. Point out the /ie/ sound in _stripes_ and the /ae/
sound in _brave_ . They can also use what they have learned about closed syllables
to help them read the multisyllabic words _ran•sacked, con•struct,_ and _rock•ets_ .












  - Using the cards you prepared in advance, show students one word at
a time, asking them to first read the word. Ask students to use each word
in a sentence illustrating its meaning. Randomly tape the words to the
board/chart paper.


  - Tell students that you will now put the words in alphabetical order. Fold over
the cards and paper clip them so that just the first letter shows as you did in
previous lessons.


  - Ask: “Do you see any words that begin with ‘a’? Yes— _anthem_ —so this will
be the first word alphabetically in our list. ‘b’? Yes, I have three words that
begin with ‘b’— _burned_, _brave_, and _bomb_ . I wonder how we know which one to

sentence that relates to
the topic sentence in each
paragraph.


Challenge


Have students provide
an example of a sentence
that would not be
appropriate for one or all
of the paragraphs.

 - After reading the paragraph aloud, tell students that you are now going to
test to see if the first sentence is the topic sentence.


 - Ask students to draw a line under the sentence: _Cookies are the best treat._


 - Now read the next sentence aloud to the class: _They are very sweet and_
_very tasty._ Ask, “Is that sentence about what a good treat cookies are?”
_(Yes)_


 - Read the next sentence aloud: _Also, there are lots of different yummy flavors_
_of cookies._ Ask, “Is that sentence about what a good treat cookies are?” _(Yes)_


 - Say, “So far, are all of the sentences in this paragraph all about what a good
treat cookies are?” _(Yes)_


 - Read the next sentence aloud: _If you get tired of one kind of cookie, you_
_can always try another kind._ Ask, “Is that sentence about what a good treat
cookies are?” _(Yes)_


 - Read the next sentence aloud: _I can’t think of one thing that’s bad about_
_cookies._ Ask, “Is that sentence about what a good treat cookies are?” _(Yes)_


 - Point out that all of the sentences in the paragraph relate back to the first
sentence, _Cookies are the best treat_ . This sentence lets readers know what
the rest of the paragraph will be about.


 - Tell students that the first sentence is the topic sentence. Ask students to
draw a box around the sentence that they previously underlined.


 - Repeat these steps for the second and third paragraphs. If you feel students
are ready, have them work independently to examine the remaining
paragraphs.

**Guided Reading Supports and Purpose for Reading**


**Note:** It is important that you stop frequently to ask students questions and
check for their understanding of the material, much in the same way you use
the Guided Listening Supports in Knowledge. It is critical that you clear up
any misunderstandings that students may have as you teach each chapter,
so the misunderstandings do not compound over time.


  - Be sure to call students’ attention to and discuss the images and captions
accompanying the text, as they often reinforce understanding of the text.


Pages 86 and 87


  - Read the title of the chapter together as a class, “The End of the War.”


  - Tell students to read **page 86** to themselves to find the answer to the
question: “What happened when the British attacked New Orleans?”


  - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer. _(Andrew Jackson and his men crouched behind their walls and_
_fired. They kept firing, and the British gave up their attack.)_

 - Say, “I wonder what happened after the battle. Let’s read **page 88** to
find out.”


 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer. _(After time passed, a letter arrived saying that the war was already_
_over. This was two weeks before the Battle of New Orleans, but Jackson and_
_his men did not know that.)_


 - Ask, “Why didn’t Jackson and his men know the war had ended?” _(News_
_traveled slowly, so it took a couple of weeks for news of the treaty to get to_
_the United States.)_


 - Direct students’ attention to the image on **page 89** .


Pages 90 and 91


 - Tell students to read **page 90** to themselves to find the answer to the
question: “What changed as a result of the War of 1812?”


 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer. _(Americans had battled together as a nation, and they had done_
_it well.)_


 - Ask, “What did the end of the war mean for the United States?” _(The end of_
_the war marked the start of a new age in U.S. history, an age of national pride.)_


 - Direct students’ attention to the image on **page 91**, and ask students to read
the caption to themselves.


**Wrap-Up**

 - Display and discuss Timeline Card 17 (The Battle of New Orleans) and
Timeline Card 18 (Andrew Jackson) and tape them to the designated spots
on the timeline [after Timeline Card 16 (Frances Scott Key)]. Review with
students that the treaty ending the war was actually signed before the
Battle of New Orleans, but people in the United States did not know that.


 - Tell students that the timeline is now complete. Review the images on the
timeline, and engage students in a discussion of what they have learned
related to the images.

~~**INTRODUCE /O/ › ‘A’ AND ‘WA’ (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 25.3.


  - Tell students that they are going to learn about a new spelling alternative. Explain
that you are going to read a story to them as they follow along with the pictures
in their Activity Book, much as they did in the lesson where they learned about
the schwa sound and heard the story about the Spelling Spoilers.


  - Ask students to point to the first picture on the page. Tell students that this is
a picture of Watkins Llama and that he is going to tell them about some new
sound-spellings.


  - As students point to the picture, read the following:


    - “Hi, Second Graders, my name is Watkins Llama. I like to wear green pajamas. I

am a very special llama because my name will help you remember the spelling of

a special sound: /o/. (Ask students to point to the next picture beside Watkins.)

My friend, Wanda Swan, will help you remember this sound as well. (Ask students

to point to the picture below Watkins.) Wanda and I both like to paint with

watercolors. (Ask students to point to the picture below Wanda.) Sometimes we

like to pretend we can take a magic wand and make waffles appear for breakfast.”


  - Tell students that they will learn two new spelling alternatives for the sound /o/.
Remind students that the basic code spelling that they learned in Kindergarten
for the sound /o/ is ‘o’. Encourage students to offer examples of several words
with this spelling and write them on the board/chart paper (e.g., _hop_, _stop_, _sock)_ .


**TEKS 2.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (iii) decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open
syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables;
(v) decoding words using knowledge of syllable division patterns such as VCCV, VCV, and VCCCV.

- Now write the name of the first character in the story, _Watkins_ _Llama_, on
the board/chart paper, as students refer to his name on Activity Page 25.3.
Point out that the pronunciation of the first part of his name is /wotkins/ and
underline the spelling ‘wa’ asking students to do the same on Activity Page
25.3. The ‘wa’ spelling represents the /o/ sound in this word.


- Now point out that the pronunciation of the second part of his name is
/lom ə / and underline the spelling ‘a’ asking students to do the same on
Activity Page 25.3. In this word, the spelling ‘a’ represents the /o/ sound.


- Write the name of the other character in the story, _Wanda_ _Swan_, and use
the same steps as above to discuss the use of the spelling ‘wa’ to represent
the /o/ sound in each part of this character’s name.

/o/ > ‘wa’ ( _water_ ) and /o/ > ‘a’ on the appropriate spaces and discuss
the respective power bars.


- Tell students to turn to **page 7** of the **Individual Code Chart** to locate
both sound spellings. Direct students to outline both cards with their
green markers.


- Show students the spelling leaves that you prepared: _Watkins, Wanda, water,_
_watercolor, wand,_ and _waffle_ .


- Read the words aloud as a class. Then display the other set of leaves that
you created. Read those leaves aloud as a class. Remind students that they
can use what they know about syllable types and chunking to read and spell
multisyllabic words. Use _wan•der_ as an example of how to use the VCCV
pattern to chunk and read a word.


- Tell students that when the sound /w/ is followed by the letter ‘a’ the sound is
/o/ rather than /a/ as they might expect.


- Pass out leaves, and ask students to circle the letters that stand for the /o/
sound on each leaf. Have student pairs read the word aloud to the class and
tape it to the appropriate new branch. As students are affixing the leaves to
the branch, other students may color Watkins’s pajamas green.

  - Remind students what they have learned about abbreviating months of the
year. Explain that they will encounter months in the passage (December,
January) and should use their own paper to write the abbreviations for the
dates (e.g., Dec. 24, 1814).


Observation: Anecdotal Reading Record


As you listen to students read “The End of the War,” make notes regarding their

individual reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record.


~~**RE-READ “THE END OF THE WAR” (10 MIN.)**~~







After students have finished reading “The End of the War” with their partners,
lead students in a purposeful re-reading of the text by doing the following:


 - asking text-dependent questions that require students to draw on
evidence from the text;


 - identifying and discussing general academic (Tier 2) vocabulary;


 - discussing sections of the text that might pose a difficulty due to complex
syntax, dense information, challenging transitions, or that require
inferences; and


 - engaging students in a culminating writing activity that is completed
independently, if possible.

**Primary Focus:** Students will review /o/ > ‘a’ and ‘wa’, will read two- and three-syllable
words featuring the sound spelling and will read sentences featuring words with /o/ > ‘a’
and ‘wa’ and match pictures with the sentences. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii; TEKS 2.2.B.v**~~


~~**REVIEW /O/**~~ ~~>~~ ~~**‘A’ AND ‘WA’ (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Pass out Activity Page 25.3 that you collected during the previous lesson.


  - Remind students that in the previous lesson Watkins Llama and his friend
Wanda helped students learn that the spellings ‘a’ and ‘wa’ can represent
the /o/ sound.


  - For review, ask students to read the words on the ‘wa’ branch of the /o/
Spelling Tree, calling attention to the /w/ sound that precedes each ‘a’ spelling.


  - Tell students that they also learned that sometimes the sound of the spelling
‘a’ on its own represents the /o/ sound, as in the world _llama_ . Tell students
they will learn some new words in which the spelling ‘a’ is pronounced /o/.


  - Write ‘qu’ on the board/chart paper, and ask students what sound this
spelling represents. _(/k/ /w/)_


  - Now show students the prepared spelling leaves for _squash, squat_, and
_squad_ . Have students read the words and place them on the ‘a’ spelling
branch of the /o/ Spelling Tree. Remind students that they can use what
they know about syllable types and chunking to read and spell multisyllabic
words. Use _dra•ma_ as an example of how to use the VCV pattern to chunk
and read a word.


  - Tell students that today they will learn some additional words in which the
spelling ‘a’ represents the sound /o/. Ask students to point to the first picture
on Activity Page 25.3. As students point to the picture, read the following:


_“Hi, Second Graders, Watkins Llama here again. I am back to tell you a little_
_more about words in which the spelling ‘a’ can stand for the /o/ sound. In_
_the last lesson you learned that the letter ‘a’ can stand for the /o/ sound_
_when it follows the /w/ sound. Today you are going to learn some more_
_words in which ‘a’ stands for /o/, even when there is no /w/ sound._


**TEKS 2.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (iii) decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open
syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables;
(v) decoding words using knowledge of syllable division patterns such as VCCV, VCV, and VCCCV.

_Listen to the word_ llama _. Do you hear the /o/ sound in_ llama _? You_
_can hear it in two places. Guess what—the /o/ is spelled with the_
_letter ‘a’ in both spots. Listen again: I like to wear green pajamas. Do_
_you hear the /o/ sound in the middle of_ pajamas _? It is spelled with_
_the letter ‘a’. Do you remember my friend, Wanda Swan? She likes to_
_act in plays and dramas. Do you hear the /o/ sound in_ drama _? Just_
_like the ‘o’ sound in_ llama _, the /o/ sound in_ drama _is spelled with the_
_letter ‘a’ in both spots. Your teacher is going to show you some more_
_new words to add to your Spelling Tree now.”_


**Note:** Some people pronounce _pajamas_ as /p/ / ə / /j/ /a/ /m/ / ə / /z/ but

in this program, the second ‘a’ in _pajamas_ is pronounced /o/: /p/ / ə / /j/ /o/

/m/ / ə / /z/


 - Show students the spelling leaves that you prepared: _father, grandma,_
_grandpa, lava, pajamas, drama,_ and _llama_ .


 - Read the words aloud as a class.


 - Pass out leaves and ask students to circle the letters that stand for the
/o/ sound on each leaf.


 - Have student pairs read each word aloud to the class and tape it to the
‘a’ branch on the /o/ Spelling Tree.

  - Remind students that they can use what they have learned about VCe
syllables to read and spell the words. Point out the _/ae/_ sound in _tra•ders_ .
They can use what they have learned about closed syllables (syllables
that end in a short vowel sound and a consonant) to help them read the
multisyllabic words _rag•tag_, _knott•y_, and _riv•er_ . They can also use what they
know about open syllables (syllables that end in a long vowel sound) to read
the words _de•fend_ and _high•ways_ .


  - Using the cards you prepared in advance, show students one word at a time,
asking them to first read the word. Ask students to use each word in a sentence
illustrating its meaning. Tape the words randomly on the board/chart paper.

- Tell students that you will now put the words in alphabetical order. Fold over
the cards and paper clip them so just the first letter shows as you did in
previous lessons.


- Ask: “Do you see any words that begin with ‘a’? No. ‘b’? No ‘c’? No. ‘d’? Yes, I have
two words that begin with ‘d’— _drains_ and _defend_ . I wonder how we know which
one to put first? Let me unfold one more letter. (Fold the cards so the ‘dr’ and ‘de’
are visible.) Oh, I see. ‘e’ comes before ‘r’, so I will put the word that starts with
‘de’— _defend_ —before the word that starts with ‘dr’— _drain_ . ‘e’? No. ‘f’? Yes, _fired_ is
next. ‘g’? Yes, I have two words that begin with ‘g’— _goods_ and _general_ . I wonder
how we know which one to put first? Let me unfold one more letter. (Fold the
cards so the ‘go’ and ‘ge’ are visible.) Oh, I see. ‘e’ comes before ‘o’, so I will put
the word that starts with ‘ge’— _general_ —before the word that starts with ‘go’—
_goods._ ” Proceed in this way until all cards have been alphabetized.


- Unfold the cards and read the words aloud with students.


- Explicitly tell the students that the words are now in alphabetical order.

 - Remind students that they can use what they know about syllable types and
chunking to read and spell multisyllabic words. Use _grand•ma_ as an example
of how to use the VCCCV pattern to chunk and read a word.


 - Follow the procedure for Word Baseball that you have used in previous lessons.


~~**DECODE, SPELL, AND USE WORDS WITH PREFIXES (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students that we can decode, or read, words with prefixes by
segmenting and blending the sounds and using the syllable chunking method.


 - Tell them that prefixes are word parts added to the beginning of a base
word to change the meaning of the word. Review what they have learned in
previous units about adding _un–, dis–,_ and _re–_ to words. Remind them that
each of these prefixes is one syllable.


 - Display some of the following words: _unbroken, unafraid, unreal, rename,_
_respray, reappear, disservice, disrespect, disorder_ .


 - Point to a word. Identify the prefix and segment it (e.g., /u/ /n/). Model
segmenting the base word (e.g., /r/ /ee/ /l/).


 - Pause between the syllables. Underline the prefix and the base word.


 - Next, remind students that prefixes change the meaning of the word. For
example, _real_ becomes _unreal_ when we add the prefix _un–,_ which means
“not.” Remind students that _dis–_ also means “not,” and _re–_ means “again.”


 - Say, “For words with prefixes, the spelling of the base word does not change
when the prefix is added.”


 - Remind students that when they come across a word with a prefix while
reading, breaking the word into its parts (prefix and base word), can help
them understand what the word means.


 - For practice, have small groups use their own paper to create and identify the
meaning of words with the prefixes _un–, dis–,_ and _re–_ . Provide base words
and have them add prefixes. Have volunteers share their words and their
meanings. Offer feedback as needed.

~~**MR. MOWSE’S REPORT ON THE WAR OF 1812 (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that they have been learning about writing paragraphs.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to explain what a paragraph and a topic sentence are.


) **Digital Component 28.1**


  - Direct students’ attention to the poster and read the definition of
_concluding sentence_ .

  - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 28.1. Remind students that in the
previous lesson they read a letter from Mr. Mowse in which he talked about
how much he was learning about the War of 1812, even though he still had
some questions.

  - Tell students that Mr. Mowse has also been listening to their lessons about
writing paragraphs and decided to try writing some paragraphs about the
War of 1812.

  - Read the title of the activity page, and explain that a report is a piece of
writing about a nonfiction topic. Tell students that Mr. Mowse started writing
his report and, although he remembered some really good information about
the War of 1812, he had difficulty organizing his thoughts, so he needs some
help from the class.

  - Tell students that the sentences on the front of the activity page are all
from the same paragraph about the start of the War of 1812. There are six
sentences: one is a topic sentence, one is a concluding sentence, and the
rest are sentences that provide supporting details for the topic sentence.
However, the sentences are not in the proper order.


**TEKS 2.9.D** Recognize characteristics and structures of informational text, including (i) the central idea and supporting
evidence with adult assistance; (iii) organizational patterns such as chronological order and cause and effect stated explicitly.

detail sentences, and
a sentence that does
not stay on topic. You
may wish to use these
paragraphs as practice
with the whole group.


Support


Have students underline
the topic sentence and all
the sentences that stay on
topic, to more easily see
which sentence does not
stay on topic and needs to
be crossed out.


**302**




 - Ask students to read all of the sentences aloud as a group, thinking in
particular about which sentence might be the topic sentence. After a brief
discussion, have all students mark the topic sentence.

 - Next, ask students to identify and mark the concluding sentence. Remind
students that often the concluding sentence is a restatement of the topic
sentence. Remind students that the concluding sentence is the very last
sentence in a properly sequenced paragraph.

 - Finally, tell students that the remaining sentences are all details supporting
the topic sentence. Ask them to number the remaining sentences in a logical
order so they make sense.

 - Complete the back of the activity page with the next group of sentences in
the same manner.

~~**STAYING ON TOPIC (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 28.2, and explain that it includes
several paragraphs. Each paragraph has a topic sentence, followed by
additional sentences.

 - Explain, however, that in each paragraph, there is an extra sentence that does
not relate to the topic sentence.

  - Direct students’ attention to the Write a Research Paper chart you prepared
in advance and read the three steps listed with students (Plan, Draft, Edit).


  - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 29.1, telling them it is the same as the chart.


  - Remind them that throughout Grade 2, they have been practicing different
forms of writing: summaries of stories they have read, new endings for
stories, and persuasive letters.


  - Remind students that whenever they have practiced writing, they have used
a three-step writing process.


  - Have students identify the three steps—plan, draft, and edit—as they refer to
the Write a Research Paper chart and Activity Page 29.1.


  - Explain that students are now going to learn about writing reports. They will
use the same three-step process, but will also learn some specific “ministeps” for planning, drafting, and editing when they are writing a report.


  - Explain that since a report is about a nonfiction topic, one of the first things
that students need to do before writing a report is to choose a specific topic.
Ask students to think back to the report that they just read by Mr. Mowse and
identify the topic of his report. _(the War of 1812)_


  - Write **Choose a topic** on the chart as the first mini-step in planning,
and have students write the same on the first line of Activity Page 29.1.
Explain that reports can be written about any nonfiction topic in history or
science. Encourage them to discuss examples of possible nonfiction topics
that might be of interest to them for report writing; make sure that they name
nonfiction topics.


  - Next, explain that once a topic has been selected, prior to starting to write
about a nonfiction topic, students need to make sure they are knowledgeable
about the topic. Tell students that the second mini-step in planning is to
**Gather information** . Record this step on the chart as students copy it onto
their activity page.


  - Explain that when gathering information for a report, writers pull together
as many different resources about that topic as possible. These resources

can include books, articles in magazines, and other reference books, such as
atlases and encyclopedias, when applicable. You may also want to arrange for a
classroom visit to the school library.


 - Ask students what resources they think Mr. Mowse may have used to write
his report. _(_ The War of 1812 _Reader)_


 - Next, explain and record the third mini-step in planning a report, **Read and**
**take notes** about the topic. Direct students’ attention the notes you displayed
from previous lessons. Discuss them, pointing out that when you take notes,
you often only write short phrases rather than complete sentences.


 - Tell students that you will now talk about some mini-steps for the draft step.
Remind them that this is when they will actually start writing about their
topic. When writing a draft of a nonfiction report, it is important to **Organize**
**notes** . Record this mini-step on the chart, and have students do the same on
their activity page.


 - Explain that when they organize their notes, writers group similar ideas from
their notes together so they will be ready to write paragraphs.


 - Record as the next mini-step in drafting **Write paragraphs**, and have
students do the same on their activity page.


 - Remind students that they have already learned a lot about writing
paragraphs in this unit. They know that a good paragraph has a topic and a
concluding sentence, as well as supporting details.


 - Point out that the final step is to edit, which has three mini-steps. Record
**Use editing checklist** as the first mini-step and have students do the same.
Remind students that that they have used editing checklists throughout
Grade 2 to refine their drafts.


) **Digital Component 29.2**


 - Now ask students to turn to Activity Page 29.2 as you display the digital
version. Read the checklist aloud as a group, and discuss the questions.
Note for students that this checklist is somewhat different from the editing
checklist they have used in the past that was created for editing stories.

additional questions
related to the topic
you identified together.




 - Ask students to brainstorm any additional questions that they may also have
about the topic you identified together. Be sure to guide students in posing
questions that are relevant to the topic and not just general questions about
the War of 1812.


 - Record any additional student questions on the chart. Tell students that over
the next several lessons you will use these questions as a guide to write a

~~**TOPIC SENTENCES AND CONCLUDING SENTENCES (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students that they have been learning about writing paragraphs.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to tell you the features of a good paragraph. _(topic sentence, supporting_

_details, concluding sentence)_


 - Display the sentences that you prepared in advance, and tell students that
you have written a paragraph that includes some information about the War
of 1812. **Let students know that the paragraph does not yet have a topic**
**sentence or concluding sentence.**


) **Digital Component 29.4**


_One reason Americans were angry with the British in 1812 was that_
_the British forced some American sailors to serve in the British Navy._
_The British were also stopping American ships from trading freely_
_with the French. Another reason Americans were angry was that the_
_British were trading with Native Americans. This created problems_
_for American pioneers who were trying to move west._


 - Read the paragraph aloud with students, and then ask them to brainstorm
ideas for an appropriate topic sentence for the beginning of the paragraph.


 - Ask questions to guide students in recognizing that this paragraph is about
the different reasons that the Americans were angry with the British in 1812.


 - Help rephrase students’ ideas for a topic sentence into a single, complete
sentence, and then write this at the beginning of the paragraph,
remembering to indent. Possible topic sentences might be:


Foundational Skills 6



**312**


    - There were many reasons that Americans were angry with the British
before the War of 1812.


    - There were many things that led to the War of 1812.


  - Reread the entire paragraph with the topic sentence.


  - Tell students that good paragraphs also have a concluding sentence at the
end of the paragraph. A good concluding sentence wraps things up and often
is a restatement of the topic sentence.


  - Ask students to suggest ideas for a concluding sentence for this paragraph
and then write it at the end of the paragraph. One example of a concluding
sentence might be the following:


    - All of these reasons led to the start of the War of 1812.


  - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 29.3. Complete the first paragraph
together as a teacher-guided activity. If time permits, have students
complete the second paragraph on their own.

topic sentence by underlining it. They should then cross out any sentence in
the group that does not pertain to the topic.


  - Tell students that although they have completed similar exercises in earlier
lessons, in those exercises the sentences were logically organized in a
paragraph. This activity page requires more attention because the sentences
in each group are not necessarily listed in the order that they would be
written in a paragraph.


  - Guide students in identifying the topic sentence and the irrelevant sentence

and decided that all of the questions were about the U.S. flag and
“The Star-Spangled Banner.”


  - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 29.1.


  - Remind them that this activity page lists the steps and mini-steps of the
process for writing a report. Point out that students already completed the
first mini-step of the planning phase ( **Choose a topic** ) in Lesson 29, because
they chose a topic based on Mr. Mowse’s questions.


  - Tell students that they now need to complete the next mini-step: **Gather**
**information** . Tell students that they could gather information from many
sources, but today they are going to start by looking at the chapter in the
Reader they just read so they will be able to write a report.

pages, take notes during the reading to answer the questions.


  - Remind students that when they take notes, they should write only the
important words and phrases necessary to answer the questions, rather than
complete sentences. An example would be: “What is the name of our national
anthem?” Instead of students writing a complete sentence, they would
simply write _“The Star-Spangled Banner_ . _”_

~~**DECODE, SPELL, AND USE WORDS WITH PREFIXES (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Have students warm up by reviewing what they have learned about decoding,
or reading, words with prefixes by segmenting and blending the sounds and
using the syllable chunking method.


  - Prompt them to recall that prefixes are word parts added to the beginning of a
base word to change the meaning of the word. Review what they have learned
about adding _un–, dis–,_ and _re–_ to words. Remind them that each of these
prefixes is one syllable and adding a prefix does not change the spelling of the
base word.


  - Display the following words: _unfold, recover, dishonest._


  - Point to a word. Identify the prefix and model segmenting the prefix and the
base word.


  - Next, point out that prefixes change the meaning of the word. Remind students
that _un–_ and _dis–_ mean “not” and _re–_ means “again.”


  - For practice, have small groups use their own paper to create and identify the
meaning of words with the prefixes _un–, dis–,_ and _re–_ .

Foundational Skills 6


- Tell students that when writers write a report, they often use several sources
_(books, magazine articles, etc.)_ to gather information on their topic. Ask
students to identify how many different sources they have used thus far to
gather information to answer Mr. Mowse’s questions. _(Answers may vary_
_depending on the type of sources you and your students have consulted, in_
_addition to the Reader chapters.)_


- Tell students that when you use different sources to gather information, once
you have finished all of your research, it is important to go back and look
at all of your notes and organize them into groups that relate to different
aspects or parts of the report topic.


- Remind students that the overall topic of their report is the U.S. flag and our
national anthem. Tell them this is the overall topic of their report, but it is
likely that their report will have different parts (and paragraphs) once they
look at and organize all of their notes.


- Ask students to spend several minutes briefly scanning their notes on
Activity Page 31.1 and to then identify what all of these notes refer to. _(our_
_national anthem and the U.S. flag)_


- Now ask students to spend several minutes briefly scanning their notes on
Activity Page 32.1 and to now identify what all of these notes refer to. _(what_
_the words in our national anthem mean)_


- Tell students that they are fortunate because, thanks to the way the notetaking activity pages were set up, their notes have already been organized
in two different groups that they will now use to create two parts/two
paragraphs for their report.


- Have students put Activity Page 32.1 aside, leaving Activity Page 31.1 on their
desk. They should also take out Activity Page 33.4.


- Tell students that they are going to now use their notes on Activity Page 31.1
to write a draft of their first paragraph on Activity Page 33.4. Point out that
there is a space at the top of this activity page to write the title of their report.
Explain that the title should provide an idea of what the topic is.


- Explain that many times the title may actually be the same as the topic and
that’s fine. Have them refer to the topic that they previously identified and
that you recorded on the questions chart, and encourage them to brainstorm
a title for their report.

**Draft the First Paragraph of Report** ~~**TEKS 2.12.B**~~

  - Remind students that they have learned that good paragraphs have a
topic and concluding sentence, as well as several sentences that provide
supporting details for the topic sentence.


  - Ask students to take a few minutes to read through all of their notes on
Activity Page 31.1. When they have had sufficient time, brainstorm ideas for
a topic sentence for this paragraph as a group. When all have agreed to the
topic sentence, tell students to write this sentence on Activity Page 33.4, as
you model writing it on the board/chart paper. Remind students to indent the
topic sentence.


  - Tell students that next you are going to create and write sentences that
provide supporting details for the topic sentence. You should also have the
chart paper copy of these same notes displayed.


  - Ask students to take a few minutes to individually reread their notes, thinking
about the order in which they might want to write about these things in their
paragraph. Suggest that they number their notes on their activity page in the
order in which they think they should write about them in the paragraph.


  - Once students have had time to number their notes on their individual
activity pages, discuss as a class the order in which they think this
information should be presented in their paragraph. Guide students in
reaching consensus so you can number the notes on your chart paper.


  - Work as a group to first orally state in a complete sentence the information
numbered as ‘1’ in your notes. Model writing this sentence after the topic
sentence on chart paper as students write the sentence on their activity pages.


  - Ask students to continue writing sentences with supporting details using the
information in the notes.


  - Remind students that they need to end their paragraph with a good
concluding sentence. Discuss possibilities orally, and then write a concluding
sentence to end this paragraph on the draft.


  - If time still remains, ask students to start writing the second paragraph of
the report. If so, have them take out Activity Page 32.1; you may also want to
have them use Activity Page 33.5 so they have a clean page with sufficient
space to write the second paragraph.


  - Remind students that this page of notes is about the meaning of the words in
our national anthem. Ask them to review their notes and then brainstorm a
good topic sentence.


**TEKS 2.12.B** Compose informational texts, including procedural texts and reports.

  - Depending on your students, you may want to continue as you did with the
first paragraph and guide students step by step in creating the paragraph.
If all or some students are capable, you may want to encourage them to try

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


Identify students who need to complete the optional Fluency Assessment
based on their scores on the Silent Reading Comprehension Assessment.
The optional Fluency Assessment provides a more focused, one-on-one
assessment for students who incorrectly answered two or more of the eight
questions on the Silent Reading Comprehension Assessment.


To administer this section of the assessment, you will pull students aside
individually and ask each to read aloud to you the same story they read
silently. You should keep a running record during this reading and calculate
a Words Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.) score using the guidelines in this
lesson. This will provide an indication of fluency. Students will read from a
copy of the text found in Teacher Resources while you keep a running record
on Activity Page 33.1.


In addition, this writing lesson is a continuation of the writing lesson you
started in the previous lesson. Have students start or continue writing the
second paragraph of the report using their notes from Activity Page 32.1.
Have them write their draft on Activity Page 33.5.


**Reading**

 - Prepare a copy of “The Young Mouse” found in Teacher Resources for
students to read aloud to you.


 - Plan for independent activities students can complete while you administer
the Fluency Assessment to individual students. This may include rereading
chapters in _The War of 1812_ Reader, completing Pausing Point activity
pages, or engaging in other independent activities you have identified
as appropriate.


**Writing**

 - Have students’ copies of Activity Pages 29.1, 29.2, 31.1, 32.1, and 33.5 ready
to hand out to them.

**Primary Focus:** Students will read “The Young Mouse” aloud with appropriate
accuracy, rate, and expression and will answer literal and inferential questions
about key details in the text. ~~**TEKS 2.4; TEKS 2.6.F; TEKS 2.6.G**~~


~~**FLUENCY ASSESSMENT**~~


  - Have one student at a time come to a quiet assessment area to read
“The Young Mouse” with you.


  - Place a copy of “The Young Mouse” from Teacher Resources in front of the
student. Ask the student for Activity Page 33.1 (copy of “The Young Mouse”)
and Activity Page 34.1 (W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet). You will use Activity Page
33.1 to mark a running record as you listen to the student read orally.


  - Tell the student that you are going to ask him or her to read the story aloud.


  - Explain that you are going to use a watch to see how long it takes them to
read the story. Tell the student that this is not a race; they should read at
their regular pace and not rush.


  - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the title. If you are
using a watch, write the exact Start Time, in minutes and seconds, on your
record page.


  - If you are using a stopwatch, you do not need to write down the start time
since the stopwatch will calculate Elapsed Time.


  - As the student reads the story, make a running record on the copy with the
student’s name using the following guidelines:






|Words Read Correctly|No mark is required.|
|---|---|
|**Omissions**|Draw a long dash above the word omitted.|
|**Insertions**|Write a caret (^) at the point where the insertion<br>was made.<br>If you have time, write down the word that was<br>inserted.|
|**Words Read Incorrectly**|Write an ‘X’ above the word.|

|Substitutions|Write the substitution above the word.|
|---|---|
|**Self-Corrected Errors**|Replace original error mark with an ‘SC’.|
|**Teacher-Supplied Words**|Write a ‘T’ above the word<br>(counts as an error)|



- When the student finishes reading the story, write the exact Finish Time in
minutes and seconds on your record sheet.


- Alternatively, if you are using a stopwatch, simply write down the Elapsed
Time in minutes and seconds.


- If the student reads very slowly, you may need to stop the reading before the
student gets to the end of the story. (Five minutes should be enough time to
get a measurement.) If the student does not read to the end, draw a vertical
line on the record sheet to indicate how far the student read. Also write down
either the Finish Time or the Elapsed Time.


- After the student finishes reading, ask the following oral comprehension
questions to see how much of the story the student understood on the
second reading.






  - Repeat this process for additional students.


Lesson 34 End-of-Year Assessment: Fluency
**353**


**354**



**Scoring and Analysis**

 - If the reading was fairly accurate (<10 uncorrected errors), you can get a
rough (and easy) estimate of a student’s W.C.P.M. score simply by noting
the time and looking at the chart on Activity Page 34.1.


 - To calculate a student’s exact W.C.P.M. score, use the information you wrote
on the record sheet and follow the described steps. The steps are also shown
in graphic form on Activity Page 34.1 (W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet). You will
probably find it helpful to have a calculator available.


   - First, complete the Words section of the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


   - Count Words Read. This is the total number of words that the student
read or attempted to read, up to the point where they stopped. It includes
words that the student read correctly as well as words that the student
read incorrectly or skipped over. If the student attempted to read the
whole story, including the title, use 357 words as your total. If the student
did not finish the story, you will need to count the number of words that
the student actually attempted to read. Write the count for Words Read in
the matching box on the W.C.P.M. Calculation Sheet.


   - Count the Uncorrected Mistakes noted in your running record. This
includes words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and words that
you had to supply. Write the total in the box labeled Uncorrected Mistakes.
(A mistake that is corrected by the student is not counted as a mistake;
the student is penalized for the time he or she lost making the correction,
but not for the initial mistake.)


   - Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get Words Correct.


   - Next, complete the Time section of the activity page.


   - Calculate Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a stopwatch,
this should already be done for you. Skip to the next step.) If you used a
watch and recorded start and stop times, you will need to subtract the
Start Time from the Finish Time to calculate the Elapsed Time. Subtract
seconds from seconds then minutes from minutes. Calculate Time in
Seconds. Multiply the number of minutes by 60 to convert minutes to
seconds, and then add the number of seconds.


   - Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then multiply by 60 to get
Words Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.).


 - As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider:


   - It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.
scores. However, a major goal for Grade 2 students is to read with
sufficient fluency to ensure comprehension and independent reading of


Foundational Skills 6


  - school assignments in subsequent grades. Exact fluency targets vary from
state to state; the national mean calculated by Hasbrouck and Tindal in
2006 for Spring of Grade 2 is 91 W.C.P.M.


  - A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared with the score of other
students in the classroom (or grade level) and also with the national
fluency norms for Spring of Grade 2 obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal.
Students whose scores are below the 25th percentile (62 W.C.P.M), are
experiencing serious problems in reading fluently.


- Compare the student’s W.C.P.M. score to national norms for Spring of
Grade 2 (Hasbrouck and Tindal, 2006):














|Reading Time for<br>this story|W.C.P.M.|National Percentiles<br>for Spring, Grade 2|
|---|---|---|
|2:35|141|90th|
|3:05|118|75th|

|5:55<br>8:00<br>11:35|62<br>46<br>31|25th|




- After you have entered each student’s scores on Activity Page 34.1 (W.C.P.M

out that the references are listed in alphabetical order.


  - Have students copy these references at the very end of their draft report on
Activity Page 33.5.


  - Now tell students that the last mini-step in editing is to **Add Illustrations** .
Have students write this mini-step on Activity Page 29.1 while you write
it on the chart. Tell students that illustrations add interest to a report.
Tell them that when they finish all other editing of their report, they can
add an illustration or two.


Lesson 34 End-of-Year Assessment: Fluency
**357**


**358**




- During the remaining time, pair students to assist each other in using
Activity Page 29.2 to edit their drafts. Make sure students understand
that they should edit the paragraphs on Activity Pages 31.1 and 32.1


- Model using an example from Activity Page 29.2. Read aloud the second
question “Have I organized information into paragraphs that relate to my
topic?” Go through your draft paragraphs to determine if you have addressed
this item on the editing checklist. Think aloud as you review your writing.


- Review with students that a preposition is a word that can help tell where
something is taking place. Words such as _in, out, under, above,_ and so on,
are called prepositions. Prepositions are useful in making simple sentences
longer and more interesting.


- Remind students that a prepositional phrase is a phrase that begins with
a preposition and is followed by an object (e.g., _in the cave, on the table,_
_under the rock, above the clouds_ ). A prepositional phrase answers the same
question, _where_, that a preposition answers about something in a sentence.


- Remind students that when they write a date, they should place a comma
between the day and year (e.g., November 11, 2022). Explain that when they
list more than two items, they should separate the items in the series with
commas (e.g., We have a cat, a dog, and a bird.).


- Tell students to look for places to add prepositions and prepositional phrases
and to check for correct use of commas in a series and in dates as they edit
their report.

Note to Teacher


Students who completed the optional Fluency Assessment should also
complete the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment. The Word Reading in
Isolation Assessment is designed to assess a student’s ability to read
words containing the spellings that were taught and reviewed in Grade 2.
The emphasis in this assessment is solely on decoding accuracy.


It would be ideal to assess all students using the Word Reading in Isolation
Assessment, but if there is a time restriction, assess only students who
scored less than 80 W.C.P.M. on the Fluency Assessment.


Keep in mind that a single word will target multiple letter-sound
correspondences. For example, the word _phone_ assesses the ‘ph’
spelling for /f/, the ‘o_e’ spelling for /oe/, and the ‘n’ spelling for /n/.


In addition, this writing lesson is a continuation of the writing lesson in the
previous lesson. Have students continue editing their reports and then begin
their final drafts for publication. Students should have a final report by the
end of Lesson 36.


**Foundational Skills**

  - Prepare a copy of the Word Reading in Isolation Analysis Record located in
Teacher Resources. You will complete this to further analyze any errors made
by the student, so you will need one copy for each student.


  - Plan for independent activities students can complete while you administer
the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment to individual students. This may
include rereading chapters in _The War of 1812_ Reader, completing Pausing
Point activity pages, or engaging in other independent activities you have
identified as appropriate.


**Writing**

  - Have students’ copies of Activity Pages 29.2, 33.4, and 33.5 ready to hand
out to them.

pages, or engaging in other independent activities you have identified as
appropriate.


**Foundational Skills**

  - Prepare a copy of the Word Reading in Isolation Analysis Record located in
Teacher Resources. You will complete this to further analyze any errors made
by the student, so you will need one copy for each student.


  - Plan for independent activities students can complete while you administer
the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment to individual students. This may
include rereading chapters in _The War of 1812_ Reader, completing Pausing
Point activity pages, or engaging in other independent activities you have
identified as appropriate.

and keep the ending sound (e.g., _take, bake_ ).

 - Direct students to the alphabet posted in the classroom to use as a reference
for beginning sounds.

 - Invite students to use blends and digraphs they have learned to make
rhymes (e.g., _shake, flake, cake_ ).

 - Repeat this process with the word _dry_ .

     - The most likely error may be one of incorrectly alphabetizing the words on the back of the spelling
activity page. Additional instruction will be given with this skill as the unit progresses.


     - Students may also make the mistake of not capitalizing the proper nouns.


     - Although any of the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should still be aware that
misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find it helpful to record the actual spelling
errors that the student makes in the analysis chart. For example:


        - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


        - Is the student consistently making errors on double consonants?


        - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


        - Is the student consistently making errors on particular beginning consonants?


        - Is the student consistently making errors on schwa spellings?

**The Young Mouse**


_Once upon a time there was a young mouse who had never left his_


_mother’s side. One day the young mouse went outside for a walk_


_to explore. But it was not long until he came running back to his_


_mother._


_“Mother! Mother!” said the young mouse. “What a scare I have had!_


_I was walking along when I saw two strange animals. One of them_


_looked a lot like me. She had paws and a tail. She looked soft, and_


_kind, and graceful._


_But the other one was a scary monster! You should have seen him!_


_He had just two legs and scratched at the ground with his claws. He_


_kept beating his arms. He was ugly, too. He had no fur, just feathers,_


_and he had big red flaps hanging from his head and neck. But what_


_scared me the most was the awful sound he made. It sounded like_


_cock-a-doodle-doo!”_


Teacher Resources
**407**


_The young mouse went on. “I wanted to say hello to the nice animal_


_that looked like me. She was so lovely, and she looked so good and_


_gentle. She had thick, glossy hair and a modest face. As she looked at_


_me, she waved her fine, long tail and smiled. I think she was about_


_to speak to me when the other animal let out his awful scream. I was_


_so scared that I ran for my life. I didn’t even have time to smile back_


_at the nice animal. It is such a shame. I would have liked to meet_


_that lovely animal.”_


_“My son,” said the mother, “the animal that scared you was a rooster._


_He may look and sound scary, but he would never harm you. The_


_other animal that you saw was a cat. She may look good and gentle,_


_but she is no pal of ours. She would gladly eat you and your mice_


_pals. In fact, she would have eaten you if you had not run away. So_


_be thankful, my son, that you escaped with your life. Stay close to_


_me and remember that things are not always what they seem to be.”_

~~**WORD READING IN ISOLATION ASSESSMENT SCORING AND ANALYSIS**~~


  - The more words a student is able to read and the farther the student is able to progress in the
assessment, the stronger is his or her preparation for Grade 3.


  - The number of words read correctly indicates the following:


    - Students who score **48 or fewer words out of 70** correctly have
**minimal preparation** for Grade 3.


    - Students who score **49–59 out of 70 words** correctly have **adequate**
**preparation** for Grade 3


    - Students who score **60 out of 70 words** correctly have **outstanding**
**preparation** for Grade 3.


  - After scoring the assessment, you might find it helpful to determine which phonemes students
missed that caused them to score below the benchmark for word recognition. Note that one-syllable
words are not included in the syllabication analysis.

**Grade 2 | Foundational Skills 6**
Appendix: Using Chunking to
Decode Multisyllable Words


Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught in this program will enable students to
read one-syllable words with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences
is no guarantee that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllable words. To
this end, most students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk and
read parts of words—syllables—as a way to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can then
be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated and students are expected
to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, this program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the easiest
two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is already a
familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In addition, each
syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing_, _hunt·er_, _bust·ed_ ). The
dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain double-letter
spellings for consonants, in this program, the divider is typically placed after the double-letter
spelling rather than between the two consonants (e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers familiar
with other ways to chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is done, however,
because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single-spelling units since Kindergarten
(‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.). This program strives to be consistent in representing these
spellings in the way that the students have been taught to process them (e.g., as whole entities
for a sound). (Ultimately, as students become more proficient at decoding and chunking syllables
through subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually chunk and decode
these words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding these two-syllable
words consisting of root words and suffixes relatively easy.


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable words.
To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


Appendix
**497**


**498**



**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


 - **Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound**
**(e.g., /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/):** _let, pad, rod, tin, fun, pic·nic, un·til_


 - **Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/,**
**/ie/, /oe/, /ue/):** _cake, home, like, mule, Pete, mis·take, stam·pede_


 - **Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint, speak, proud, play, dis·may, be·low, coun·sel_


 - **R-Controlled Syllables:** _art, curb, girl, fort, clerk, tur·nip, ar·tist, fe·ver_


 - **Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /ie/,**
**/oe/, /ue/):** _go, me, hi, a·pron, fi·nal, com·pre·hend_


 - **Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple, puz·zle, raf·fe, ca·ble, ri·fe_


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


 - **Schwa Syllables:** _ben·e·fit, ap·pe·tite, a·bout, hos·pit·al, e·mo·tion_


**Note:** The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately because
of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


**To be clear, in order to decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these**
**names. The names of the syllable types are provided here only to establish a common**
**vocabulary for teachers as they use the materials.** What is necessary, however, for students to
become fluent readers of longer words in increasingly complex text is that they be able to visually
parse certain spelling patterns as syllable chunks so they can quickly and easily decode each
syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in Kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


 - When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.


_ad · mit_ _nap · kin_ _trum · pet_


 - For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed after the
double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is done because the
double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units since Kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’

  - /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).


Foundational Skills 6


_traff · ic_ _muff · in_ _happ · en_


  - When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.


_mon · ster_ _con · tract_ _pil · grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read
the first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model
for students how to blend the two syllables aloud:


In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the magic
‘E’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


  - Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for closed
syllables:


_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


In Grade 2, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to use
a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying each
possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


Appendix
**499**


**500**




 - When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:


_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_


However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There is
no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be flexible
and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to determine
whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. In order to recognize
whether a word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has
heard before (i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent
an additional challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a
second language.


 - If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:


_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is fairly straightforward.


Foundational Skills 6


  - When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings in
the words


_ban · gle_ _twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_


In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings represent
the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a combination of stressed
and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed or weakly stressed, its
vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that linguists call a schwa.
This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’ and
‘tion’. Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite challenging for many
students.


  - Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the
schwa sound has a particular spelling:


_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is actually a schwa syllable, but it is identified
separately because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


  - Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables accordingly
throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _tri·cycle_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness_ _help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten–Grade
3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.

ELLs may be at the beginning, intermediate, advanced,<br>or advanced high stage of English language acquisition in writing. In order for the ELL to meet grade-level learning expectations<br>across foundation and enrichment curriculum, all instruction delivered in English must be linguistically accommodated<br>(communicated, sequenced, and scaffolded) commensurate with the student’s level of English language proficiency.<br>For kindergarten and grade 1, certain of these student expectations do not apply until the student has reached the stage of<br>generating original written text using a standard writing system. The student is expected to:|
|ELPS 5.A|learn relationships between sounds and letters of the<br>English language to represent sounds when writing<br>in English||
|ELPS 5.B|write using newly acquired basic vocabulary and<br>content-based grade-level vocabulary|p. 108|
|ELPS 5.C|spell familiar English words with increasing accuracy,<br>and employ English spelling patterns and rules with<br>increasing accuracy as more English is acquired||
|ELPS 5.D|edit writing for standard grammar and usage, including<br>subject-verb agreement, pronoun agreement, and<br>appropriate verb tenses commensurate with grade-<br>level expectations as more English is acquired|p. 267|
|ELPS 5.E|employ increasingly complex grammatical structures<br>in content area writing commensurate with grade level<br>expectations such as (i) using correct verbs, tenses,<br>and pronouns/antecedents; (ii) using possessive<br>case (apostrophe -s) correctly; and, (iii) using<br>negatives and contractions correctly||
|ELPS 5.F|write using a variety of grade-appropriate sentence<br>lengths, patterns, and connecting words to combine<br>phrases, clauses, and sentences in increasingly<br>accurate ways as more English is acquired|p. 90, p. 313, p. 346|
|ELPS 5.G|narrate, describe, and explain with increasing<br>specificity and detail to fulfill content area writing<br>needs as more English is acquired|p. 117, p. 200, p. 209, p. 247, p. 259|
