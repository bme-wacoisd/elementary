# **Welcome!**
## **Grade 2, Unit 1** **Foundational Skills**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will review basic skills that were learned in Grade 1, such as recognizing the spellings and

producing the sounds of letters in one-syllable words. Students will also expand their reading knowledge by learning

about tricky spellings, reading decodable stories, answering questions, and reading Tricky Words.


**What** **will** **my** **student** **learn?**

Students will learn to decode tricky spellings for each of these letters: ‘c’, ‘g’, ‘s’, and ‘n’. Students will learn that the letter

‘c’ makes two sounds: /k/, a hard ‘c’ sound, as in _can_, and /s/, a soft ‘c’ sound, as in _cent_ . Students will learn that the

letter ‘g’ makes two sounds: /j/, a soft ‘g’ sound, as in _gem_, and /g/, a hard ‘g’ sound, as in _got_ . Students will learn that the

letter ‘s’ makes two sounds: /z/, as in _dogs_, and /s/, as in _cats_ . Students will learn that the letter ‘n’ makes the sound /n/,

as in _sand_, and that ‘ng’ makes the sound /ng/, as in _sang_ . Students will work on these basic code spellings and

alternative spellings for several days.


Students will practice accuracy, appropriate rate, and expression by reading different decodable stories throughout

this unit, such as “Kate Visits Doba,” “The Campsite,” “The Hike,” “Bone Man,” “The Big Dig,” “The Hot Dog,” “The Chicken

Nugget,” and “The Snack Mix.” Students will be expected to answer text-dependent questions about stories in complete

sentences orally and in written form. Students will learn and recognize Tricky Words in these decodable stories. Tricky

Words are difficult to read and spell because they do not follow the letter-sound correspondences your student has

been taught.


**Additional** **Practice**

|Tricky Words|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|_he_|_she_|_we_|_be_|_the_|_was_|
|_of_|_a_|_do_|_down_|_how_|_to_|
|_what_|_where_|_why_|_from_|_once_|_one_|
|_two_|_could_|_would_|_should_|_there_|_said_|
|_says_|_word_|||||



Students can practice these words each night by doing the following activities:


1. **Word** **Association:** Ask your student to think of other words related to the Tricky Words. This will help to

reinforce their understanding of each word’s meaning and usage.


2. **Sentence** **Creation:** Have your student use Tricky Words in sentences. Encourage them to create sentences

that demonstrate the meaning of each word and explain its context.

|Words That Follow a Spelling Pattern|Col2|Col3|Col4|
|---|---|---|---|
|_cold_|_gel_|_set_|_thin_|
|_city_|_get_|_his_|_thing_|



Students can practice these words each night by doing the following activities:


1. **Word** **Challenges:** Challenge your student to find words with the unit’s focus spelling patterns in books, in

magazines, or around the house. When they identify a word, discuss its spelling and meaning.

2. **Drawing** **and** **Writing:** Invite your student to write a sentence using the focus spelling patterns and then draw

a picture to match their sentence.
