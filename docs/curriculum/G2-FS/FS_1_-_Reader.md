**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
The book has also been carefully leveled in terms of its “code load,” or the number of
spellings used in the stories.


The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many spellings
can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to make early
reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of the available
spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out as part of their
phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been deliberately
introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if they are
assigned at the proper time.


As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.
