**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 5. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. The activity pages in this book
do not include written instructions for students because the instructions would have words that
are not decodable. Teachers will explain these activity pages to the students orally, using the
instructions in the Teacher Guide. The Activity Book is a student component, which means each
student should have an Activity Book.

**The Beginning**


Long before you were born, in a
place we can no longer find, there was
a king. King Alfred was his name.


King Alfred was in charge of a
large land that stretched from the
darkest forests of the north to the bluest
sea in the south. The people of this land
were very happy with him as their king.
King Alfred liked to have fun. He liked
parties and feasts. He was fair and kind,
and he kept his people safe.


King Alfred could not do this all by
himself. He had twelve knights to help
him keep his lands peaceful and his
people safe. These brave knights—well,
sometimes they were brave—helped to
keep bad things from happening.


The most well-known knight of
all was Sir Gus the Fearless. The king
himself had given Sir Gus the name
“Fearless.” This was an odd name, for
Sir Gus was not entirely fearless. In
fact, he had a lot of fears.


Sir Gus was scared of the dark.
He was scared of mice and bats and
spiders. He did not like boats and he
could not swim. Shadows and loud
noises made him faint. In fact, lots of
things made Sir Gus faint.

Sir Gus had all the things a knight must have. He had a shield and a lance. He had
a spear and a sword. But Sir Gus liked a long soak in a bathtub better than a fight.


Cats and horses made Sir Gus itch. Sometimes the itching was so bad that he
would start jumping up and down.


Sir Gus was rather absentminded. He got lost a lot and could rarely tell which way
to go. Sir Gus found it difficult to get up in the morning. He liked to sleep in, so he
was late most of the time.


All in all, Sir Gus was a rather odd knight. But King Alfred did not see this. What
he saw was that Sir Gus always served him well.

**The Thief**


One dark and stormy night while King Alfred was sleeping, a thief crept into his
bedroom and stole the king’s biggest golden ring. The next morning, when the king
woke up, he saw that his ring was gone!


The king was very sad.


“Someone stole my ring!” he cried in agony. “It was my father’s ring, and his
father’s before him. It is a king’s ring. I must have it back!”


King Alfred was so upset in the morning; he could not eat his herring on toast.


King Alfred summoned his twelve brave knights. Eleven of them came at once on
horseback. Sir Gus the Fearless came later, on foot. Sir Gus explained why he was late.
He explained that he had lost his horse.


“Why, good sir,” said the king, “you will not get very far on foot!”


“Yes, my lord. I mean no, my lord,” replied Sir Gus. “The problem is, your majesty,
that when I am on my horse, I itch. I had such a bad itch last night that I fell off my
horse and it ran off.”


“Well, you must stop itching then,” said the king.


Foundational Skills 5
**17**


“Yes, indeed,” replied Sir Gus, trying very hard not
to itch.


Then the king told the knights what had happened.
He told them he was counting on them to recover his
ring.


The next day, at sunrise, eleven of the knights
galloped off to find the thief.


Some time after lunch, Sir Gus was awakened by the
king himself.


“Not up yet?” asked the king.


Gus. “I was just…”


But you must be careful, Sir Gus. My
horse is the fastest in the land.”


Sir Gus got out of bed. He
stretched and yawned his loudest.
Then he got dressed.


“Do not fear,” said Sir Gus, as he
mounted the horse. “I am an—”

**All’s Well that Ends Well**


**Page 24** Sir Gus rode the king’s horse out into the country. He galloped over
green land and lovely rolling hills.

All was well, until he began to itch. He scratched his leg. He
scratched his neck. He tried to scratch his back and nearly fell off the
horse. Nothing seemed to help. At last Sir Gus told himself he had better
stop, lest he scratch himself right off the king’s horse!

Sir Gus stopped in front of a farmhouse. Near the farmhouse was a
stone well. Standing near the well was a young, strong-looking man.

Sir Gus spoke to the young man politely. “Pardon me, good sir,” he
said, “may I drink from your well?”

“Yes, you may,” said the young man.

**Page 26** Sir Gus went to draw water from the well. He grabbed the rope and
began to tug on it. But then he felt the need to scratch. He let go of the
rope and started scratching himself. Soon he was itching himself so hard
that he started jumping up and down. He jumped up and down so much
that he fell into the well and landed with a splash at the bottom.

“Ack!” cried Sir Gus. “What have I done?”

**Page 28** It was a good thing that Sir Gus was tall. The water in the well only
came up to his chest.

The young man peered down into the well.

“Have no fear!” he shouted to Sir Gus. “I will help you. I will drop
the bucket down. Take hold of it, and I will lift you up.”

Sir Gus waited nervously at the bottom of the dark well. He did not
like the dark or the cold water. His legs began to shiver and shake.

The bucket came down the well. Sir Gus grabbed the bucket and
held on tight.

Slowly the young man began to bring Sir Gus up out of the well.

**22**



**Page 30** As Sir Gus reached the top of the well, the young man offered the
knight his hand.

“Young man,” said Sir Gus, as he stepped out of the well, “I am
touched by your generous deed. I would like to thank you for helping me.
What is your name?”

“My name is Robin,” replied the man.

“Well, then, Robin,” said Sir Gus, “I thank you.”

“You are welcome,” said Robin.

The two men shook hands. Robin clasped the knight’s hand so tightly
that water dripped from his glove.

Robin smiled. “Come into my house,” he said. “I will find you some
dry clothing.”

Sir Gus went inside.

“Sit down,” said Robin. “I will fetch you some dry clothing and
something to drink.” Robin left the room.

**Page 32** Sir Gus sat down on a wooden chair. As he did so, a large black cat
jumped onto his lap. At once, Sir Gus began to itch all over. He got up
and started jumping up and down. He jumped so hard that he knocked
over a chair and bumped into a shelf.

Some things fell off the shelf. As he bent down to pick these things
up, Sir Gus spotted a ring. It was the king’s ring! Robin was the robber!

**Page 34** Sir Gus stood thinking for a moment.

“There is no point fighting with the man,” Sir Gus said to himself.
“That would be dangerous. I can tell by his grip that he is very strong.”

Sir Gus grabbed the ring. Then he tiptoed quietly out of the house.
He mounted his horse and rode back to see the king.

**Fire!**

It was not hard to find the troll. Trolls
cry when they are hungry. The knights simply
followed the sound of loud sobs and eating.

As nightfall neared, the knights arrived
at the foot of a large hill. The troll had spent
all day eating the rocks and plants on the hill.
All that was left on the hill were some prickly
plants and some old, dying trees.

Near the top of the hill was a cave. Scary
troll sounds were coming from inside the cave.

The knights met in a grove at the foot of
the hill. They knelt down and made a plan.


said Sir Tom. “Then we will creep up the hill.
The sight of the flames will scare the troll and


“I don’t care to be the troll’s dinner.”

“Well, do you have a better plan?” asked
Sir Tom.

“You!” said Sir Tom and Sir Ed together.

“But, but… well… I… er… um…,” said a reluctant Sir Gus.

It was no good trying to get out of it. Sir Tom handed Sir Gus a lit torch. Then he
pointed at the cave.

Sir Gus went up the hill alone. By the time he reached the mouth of the cave, it
was pitch black. The lit torch cast shadows on the ground.

Sir Gus looked around him. He saw shadows dancing on the ground. He was
afraid. But he pressed on.

From inside the cave came alarming troll sounds.

“Snnniccck, snnnuummm, guffumffffff!”

The troll was eating bits of rock with its sharp teeth, then spitting out the bits it
did not like.

Sir Gus approached the cave. Small pieces of rock came flying out. Some of them
landed at Sir Gus’s feet. Sir Gus jumped back, trying to avoid the flying pieces of rock.

Suddenly Sir Gus heard the deepest thumping sound he had ever heard. Thump!
Thump! Thump! The troll was coming out of the cave!

As the troll got closer, the sounds got louder.

“SNNNNICCCK, SNNNUUUUMMMM, GUFFUMFFFFFF!”

Sir Gus was afraid. He started to feel weak in the knees. At last he fainted. His
torch fell to the ground. It landed on some dry, prickly plants near the mouth of the
cave. The plants caught on fire. The flames got bigger quickly.

From inside the cave came a
scream. Then came the thumping
sound of a large beast running
away. Soon, all that remained was
the sound of crackling flames.

Below you will find our spelling words for this week. All of the words have the sound
of /ee/ (also known as long e) spelled with the letters ‘ie’. We are continuing our work
learning to alphabetize words. As the next step in this skill, we are learning to use the
alphabet as a reference tool and less as a matching tool for letters.


Just as you did last week, please follow these directions:


1. Have your student read all of the words aloud and circle the first letter in each word.


2. Ask your student to write words in alphabetical order.


3. You may find it helpful for your student to number the words in the box before writing
them in alphabetical order. It is easier to erase a number than a word.

**The King’s Ghost**


“Ar! Do as we say or die!” came the sound
of a large booming voice from somewhere on
the water.

King Alfred and eleven of his knights
jumped with fright. They had all tried to sail
the boat in the stormy waves and strong winds.
They looked up to see a pirate ship flying a
black flag. The pirate ship had sailed up next
to the king’s boat.

The king and the eleven knights were not
prepared to fight. The knights did not have
their swords or shields with them.

“I will count to ten,” shouted the pirate
chief. “If you do not hand over the king and
his boat by then, we will attack! We do not
care to harm you, but if we must, then we
must!”

The pirate chief began to count, “One,
two . . . um.” He hesitated. (Pirates aren’t good
at math!)

“Three,” came a voice from below. It was
Sir Gus. He was lying down below the deck,
and he was feeling very ill.

Sir Gus was so ill that he had no idea what
was happening. The strong winds had kept
him from hearing what the pirate chief had
said. All he could make out was the sound of
someone counting.

“Thank you,” said the pirate chief. He
went on counting. “Seven, eight, nine . . .”

“Uuuuuug! Ooooooe!” came a loud and
scary sound from inside King Alfred’s boat.

“Uuuuuug! Ooooooe!”


Foundational Skills 5
**87**

“What is that hideous sound?” yelled the pirate.

“It is the ghost of our last king, and it protects our ship!” replied Sir Tom.

Sir Tom was well aware that, in fact, the hideous sound was coming from Sir Gus,
who was feeling very sick indeed, but he was hoping to scare the pirates away with a
ghost story.

“Uuuuuug! Ooooooe!” came the sound again.

“If you harm the king,” Sir Tom shouted, “you will be haunted by this evil,
vengeful ghost! I will count to ten, and you had better go away, you thief! The ghost
would rather not harm you, but if it must, then it must.”

Pirates are very afraid of ghosts. And so, within seconds, the pirate ship began to
sail away.

Not long after, the clouds cleared and the waves died down. Sir Gus felt some relief
and came limping back up on deck.

“Well done, Sir Gus!” said the king. “You scared those evil pirates away by
pretending to be a ghost.”

“I did?” said Sir Gus, still looking rather green in the face.

“Why, yes!” said the king. “Such a clever and helpful trick! How can I ever repay
you for your wisdom and bravery? Perhaps I should award you a medal?”

“Your majesty,” said Sir Gus, “the best payment of all would be if you would order
the captain to sail this boat back to land. I find the nautical life not to agree with me.”

**The King’s Birthday**


Six months passed until King Alfred saw
his knights. This time he did not need their
help, but he asked them to come to his birthday
party. The king had asked 500 people to join
him. He had made plans for a large feast, as well
as jousting, magic, and dancing. Everyone was
very excited.

The palace was filled with five thousand
candles. Gold cloth was draped on the walls.
King Alfred had planned a treat for everyone.
Just as the jousting was about to begin, a
thousand white doves were to be released into
the sky above the palace.

King Alfred asked King Henry, the king of
another kingdom, to attend the birthday party.
The twelve knights were coming, too. King
Henry’s knights were going to challenge King
Alfred’s knights in jousting. The winners would
get 100 gold coins each.

On the day of the party, the king met with
some of his knights.

“This is going to be the best party ever!”
said the excited king. “I am eager to see each of
you joust. I think King Henry and his knights
will be amazed by your skill.”

“Winning will be our birthday gift to you,
Sire!” said Sir Pete.

“We are the most feared knights of all
time!” said Sir Tom. “We will crush them! We
will make them cry!”

Sir Gus looked on as his fellow knights
boasted of their skill. He did not join them. In
fact, he was very nervous. He was hoping that
he would not start itching and fall off his horse.

“I know you will win,” said the king. “And that will make a fine birthday present. I
thank you in advance!”

The knights began to file out.

“Sir Gus!” called the king.

“Your majesty?” said Sir Gus.

“Do you like my birthday cake?” asked the king.

“Yes, Sire.”

“Do you see how the royal baker made a tiny king out of icing that looks just like
me?”

“Yes, Sire.”

“It is a wonderful birthday present! But the best present of all will be seeing you
defeat Sir Ivan the Black Knight in the jousting.”

“Sir Ivan?” asked Sir Gus nervously.

“Yes,” said the king. “He has made quite a fearsome name for himself. But I trust
you will beat him.”

Sir Gus was too scared to speak.

The spelling words this week all have either ‘le’, ‘el’, or ‘tion’ as part of the word.
Additionally, we are asking your student to alphabetize all of the words. By now, your
student should be fairly proficient at this task and able to complete it without looking at
the alphabet. However, we would encourage you to ask your student to use the alphabet as
a checking tool when the task is complete.

he had to eat the most hot dogs. Well, my brother ate lots and lots of hot dogs—most of
the people competing found it impossible to eat as many. At the closing ceremony, my
brother was given a ton of money (one thousand in cash) and a trophy of a golden hot
dog. My brother slipped the money in his pocket and smiled modestly as people took
his snapshot. It was a fine moment for my brother.
