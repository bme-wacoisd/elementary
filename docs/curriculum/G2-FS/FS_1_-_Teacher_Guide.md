**Grade 2 | Unit 1**
Introduction


~~**WELCOME**~~


**Dear Second Grade Teacher,**


Welcome! This program has been carefully researched and crafted in order to make every student in
your classroom a reader. This program is divided into two strands: a Skills Strand and a Knowledge
Strand. You are currently reading the introduction to Unit 1 of the Skills Strand.


Some key aspects of the Skills Strand are listed here:


  - The Skills Strand provides comprehensive instruction in foundational reading skills, such as
phonological awareness, phonics and word recognition, fluency, language skills (including
conventions of English, spelling, and grammar), as well as reading comprehension and writing
instruction.


  - This program includes explicit, systematic phonics instruction in which students are taught the
letter-sound correspondences needed to independently decode words.


  - This program begins by teaching the most common or least ambiguous spelling for a sound (the
basic code spelling). Later it teaches spelling alternatives for sounds that can be spelled several
different ways. The system is kept simple at first and complexity is added bit by bit as students gain
confidence and automatize their reading and writing skills.


  - This program uses a synthetic phonics approach that teaches students to read by blending through
the word. It does not teach multiple cueing strategies, use of pictures as a primary resource in
decoding, or part-word guessing.


  - Students who successfully completed the Grade 1 program learned the “basic code” spellings, that
is, the most frequent or least ambiguous spelling, for all of the single consonant sounds; consonant
clusters, such as ‘fl’, ‘br’, and ‘st’; consonant digraphs such as ‘sh’, ch’, and ‘th’; double-letter spellings
such as ‘ss’, ‘ff’, and ‘ck’; and the basic code spellings for the short and long vowel sounds, r-controlled
vowels, and various vowel digraphs. They also learned a handful of spelling alternatives for consonant
sounds, such as ‘c’ for /s/, ‘kn’ for /n/, and ‘ai’ for /ae/. These students were also introduced to
hundreds of high-frequency words from the Dolch Sight Word List and Fry’s Instant Words List.


The remainder of this introduction will provide you with an overview of the various materials included
in the Grade 2 Skills Strand, general unit and lesson features, and detailed information about this first
unit of Skills instruction and how you will determine whether your students have the prerequisite skills
needed to be successful in the Grade 2 program.


(To learn more about the two strands and the rationale for the two strand approach, please consult
Appendix A at the end of this unit.)


Introduction

~~**SKILLS STRAND COMPONENTS**~~


Here is a list of the components provided in the Grade 2 Skills Strand:


**Teacher Components**

 - Teacher Guide (one per unit)


 - Consonant and Vowel Code Flip Books


 - Spelling Card Set


 - Timeline Cards (Unit 6 only)


 - Fluency Supplement (in the program’s online materials)


 - Digital Components (in the program’s online materials)


**Student Components**

 - Individual Code Chart


 - Activity Book (one copy per student per unit)


 - Reader (one copy per student per unit)


~~**ADDITIONAL MATERIALS**~~


Some additional materials (most typically available in Grade 2 classrooms) are needed for specific
lessons. These materials are always listed in the Lesson at a Glance chart at the beginning of each
lesson. For your convenience, a list of these additional materials is included here.


 - white or green index cards (unruled 4” x 6” or 5” x 7”)


 - yellow index cards (unruled 4” x 6” or 5” x 7”)


 - chart paper or dedicated board space


 - thin-tipped green and red markers for each student


 - notebooks/writing paper and pencils for each student


Foundational Skills 1


~~**COMPONENT DESCRIPTIONS**~~


**Teacher Components**


**Teacher Guide**


Each Skills Teacher Guide includes daily lessons that provide detailed direction for all Skills
instruction. The Teacher Guide will indicate whether instruction and/or accompanying activities
should be presented as whole group, small group, or independent practice. Instruction and exercises
should be presented in the order listed in the Lesson at a Glance chart.


**Grammar:** Specific grammar lessons and exercises address the various parts of speech and language
usage conventions, such as capitalization and punctuation, as identified in the Texas Essential
Knowledge and Skills Standards. Students first learn these concepts and practice them orally; then
they are reinforced in written text. You will also find grammar teaching opportunities in demonstration
stories. Students will also practice grammar in the daily Warm-Ups. Grammar instruction starts in
Lesson 12 of Unit 1.


**Spelling:** Explicit spelling instruction begins in Lesson 11 of Unit 1. Weekly word lists and exercises
that focus on the spellings of given sounds are included, followed by a weekly assessment. The
spelling exercises provide a systematic review of the letter-sound correspondences that students have
already learned. The weekly assessment can also provide insight as to which students may have gaps
in their code knowledge and may require remedial attention.


**Writing:** Formal writing instruction designed to address the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Standards
for writing starts in Unit 2. (In Unit 1, students focus on writing sentences in preparation for the more
challenging writing tasks of the later units.) Students will receive instruction in using a four-step writing
process: plan, draft, edit, and publish. (Note that students will also have additional writing opportunities in
the Knowledge Strand to organize and apply the specific content learned during Read-Alouds.)


**Consonant and Vowel Code Flip Books and Spelling Cards**


The Consonant and Vowel Code Flip Books will be used with the Spelling Cards in Unit 1 in a whole
group review of sound/spelling correspondences taught in Grade 1. They will continue to be used as
new sound/spelling correspondences are introduced and may also be used at any time during the year
with individual or groups of students in need of targeted remediation and practice.


Introduction
**3**


**4**



Students who participated in Grade 1 are very familiar with the introduction and review of letter-sound
correspondences using the Code Flip Books and Spelling Cards. The Flip Books show (in gray print)
the spellings for all sounds taught. As you review the sounds in this unit you will be asked to place the
corresponding Spelling Cards on the appropriate Flip Book pages.


Each Spelling Card is printed front and back. One side of the card shows the sound. The other side
of the card shows three things: the top of the card shows the spelling; the bottom shows a sample
word containing the spelling; in the middle is something called a power bar. The power bar gives an
indication of how common the spelling is for the sound it represents. A long power bar that stretches
almost across the card means that this is the main spelling for the sound and there are very few words
that have this sound spelled any other way. A very short power bar means that the spelling is less
common and occurs in fewer English words.


Also note that vowel sound spellings will always be written in green on the Spelling Cards because
when saying a vowel sound, the mouth is wide open, letting the air “go”; the one exception to this are
the r-controlled vowel sound spellings which are written in blue. Consonant sound spellings are written
in red.


**Note:** The exercises in the Unit 1 lessons are not designed to teach sound/spelling correspondences
to students who have not mastered the code taught in earlier grades; they are intended for review.
Students who have large gaps in their code knowledge will be identified through the placement
assessments presented during Lessons 6–10 of this unit so they can be appropriately placed in the
level of materials that will meet their individual instructional needs.


**Timeline Cards**


In Unit 6, students will read their first informational Reader with complex text, _The War of 1812_ . Large,
colorful cards depicting various events in American history prior to and during the War of 1812 are
provided so a classroom timeline can be created for context and reference throughout the unit. These
cards are also available in the program’s online materials, if you prefer to display them digitally.


Foundational Skills 1


**Fluency Supplement**


The _Fluency Supplement_, available in the program’s online materials, was created to accompany
Grade 2 materials and is for use at your discretion. It consists of short poetry, fiction, and nonfiction
selections, as well as Reader’s Theater. These additional text selections provide opportunities for
students to practice reading with fluency and expression (prosody). The selections are grouped by
unit; selection topics relate to the content of the respective unit’s student Reader.


The selections within a given unit can be used in any order, though they are arranged in the
supplement according to word count, starting with the shortest selections. At the beginning of
each week, it is suggested that you choose a selection online and make sufficient copies for each
student. Early in the week, you should take time to model reading the selection aloud to all students.
Then, students should take the selection home to practice reading aloud throughout the week. The
expectation for all students should be that they are prepared to read the selection fluently and with
prosody by Friday. At the end of the week, you should select a few students to individually read the
selection aloud and/or have a few students choral read the selection. Be sure to provide opportunities
for different students to read aloud each week. You may also wish to use these selections to
assess students’ performance in fluency and expression (prosody). A fluency rubric is included in
the supplement to help track students progress towards fluent reading. For more information on
implementation, along with the take-home letter for families, please consult the supplement.


**Digital Components**


The program’s online materials include copies of all stories in the student Reader and the activity
pages for each unit, so these materials may be displayed or projected for all to see. In addition,
whenever a lesson directs a teacher to create charts and/or to write substantive material on the
board, the same materials are also included in the program’s online materials to facilitate projection,
if you prefer to display them in that way.


**Student Components**


**Individual Code Chart**


The Individual Code Chart reproduces the code information included in the Vowel Code Flip Book and
Consonant Code Flip Book in a more concise manner. Students will use the Individual Code Chart to
record the vowel sound/spelling correspondences and consonant sound/spelling correspondences
that they learn. These charts are a good way for students to have at hand a guide to help them
remember what they have learned. You may wish to encourage students to refer to the Individual Code
Chart when reading and writing independently. A copy of the Grade 2 Individual Code Chart is included
in Teacher Resources at the back of this Teacher Guide for your reference.


Introduction
**5**


**Activity Book**


The student Activity Book pages are organized by lesson; the Teacher Guide provides direction within
each lesson as to when and how each activity page should be used. Some pages are designed to
be completed as a group with teacher assistance, while other pages are intended to be completed
independently by each student. In addition to practice exercises for reinforcement of skills, the
Activity Book also includes assessment pages, homework, copies of the stories read in class and
take-home letters for family members. In the program’s online materials, you will find a digital version
of the Activity Book so it can be displayed or projected for all to see as you give directions and/or
provide scaffolded instruction modeling how to complete each page.


**Reader**


The Readers for Units 1–4 contain 100% decodable text for students to read. There is one Reader for
each unit and all students should have their own copy. The last page of each Reader summarizes the
code knowledge that is assumed at the beginning of the Reader (i.e., the code knowledge that has
been taught in previous units) as well as identifies new code knowledge introduced in the current unit,
noting the first story in which these new skills are practiced.











**6**



The last few stories in each Reader are extra stories for the Pausing Point, which can be used
for assessment or extra reading practice depending on students’ needs. In the program’s online
materials, you will find a digital version of the Reader stories. These digital files allow you to present a
Reader story as a demonstration story, if you determine that this is approach is needed with some or
all of your students.


Foundational Skills 1


Students make the transition to becoming fully independent readers, prepared to confidently tackle
natural text in any grade level-appropriate book, in the Grade 2 Units 5 and 6 Readers. In the Unit 5
Reader, _Sir Gus_, not all words in the stories are decodable. However, students are taught to segment
these words using the code knowledge they have learned in order to read challenging, unfamiliar
words. In Unit 6, _The War of 1812_, students grapple with complex text in which each chapter includes
many new content-specific vocabulary words. They learn to use a glossary, as needed, to better
understand the text.


~~**UNIT AND LESSON FEATURES**~~


Within each Teacher Guide, you will find the following elements in the order listed:


  - A **Table of Contents** that provides a quick overview of the time allocation, skills, and activities
included in each lesson and the unit as a whole.


  - Individual **Lessons** for the unit:


    - Each lesson begins with a list of the **Primary Focus Objectives** . These objectives are tagged with
the corresponding Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Standards. The objectives are repeated
in subsequent parts of the lesson in association with the specific instructional activity with which
they are associated.


    - A list of the **Formative Assessment** opportunities within the lesson. These assessments are
linked to the Primary Focus Objectives and are also tagged with the corresponding Texas Essential
Knowledge and Skills Standards. Not every Primary Focus Objective is evaluated in every lesson.
Rather, specific objectives are evaluated in different lessons. Over the course of the entire unit, the
Primary Focus Objectives are assessed on multiple occasions so teachers have a clear sense of
individual student progress with regards to unit skills before the end of the unit.


    - A **Lesson at a Glance** chart listing the lesson’s instructional activities, the materials needed, and
the amount of time allotted to each activity.


    - An **Advance Preparation** section that prompts teachers to select and/or prepare lesson materials
prior to the lesson. Whenever a lesson activity suggests that the teacher write something on the
board/chart paper, this information is included in Advance Preparation. Additionally, this type of
material, as well as any activity pages that the teacher will model completing with students, is
also available in the program’s online materials that the teacher may access and project during
the lesson; URLs are provided. Finally, **Universal Access** preparation prompts are also included
to ensure that teachers are ready to adapt specific activities as needed for English Learners or
students who need additional support.


    - Throughout each lesson, **Support** and **Challenge** sidebars provide further guidance to assist
teachers in differentiating instruction. **ELD Access** sidebars provide specific tips for working with
Emergent Bilingual Students.


Introduction
**7**


**8**




   - **Take-Home** **Material** is also identified at the end of some lessons to maximize reinforcement of
skills taught during the lesson and to encourage family member involvement. Use of these activity
pages is optional, but highly recommended. Should you choose to use them, please distribute the
pages to students and instruct them to take them home to complete. At your discretion, these
Take-Home pages may also be used in classroom centers during other times of the day.


   - Foundational Skills Remediation **Additional Support** activities are suggested at the end of each
lesson for more practice and follow-up reinforcement of skills outside the 60-minute instructional
block devoted to the program. These activities can be used with any students needing more help,
including students with special needs and Emergent Bilingual Students.


 - **Student Performance Assessment(s)** representing an end-of-unit assessment are included in the
final lesson(s) of the unit.


 - **Pausing Point** suggestions for further practice and reinforcement at the end of the unit, following
the last unit lesson. Pausing Point activities are organized by the unit objectives they address. **It is**
**strongly recommended that you pause for 3 days at the end of each unit to solidify the skills**
**that have been introduced in the unit.** All students will benefit from an additional opportunity
to re-read pages from the decodable student Readers. It is particularly important to make use of
targeted activities if the end-of unit assessment and/or formative assessments indicate that any
students are experiencing difficulties with specific skills taught during the unit.


 - **Teacher Resources**, comprised of assorted forms and documents for monitoring student progress,
as well as an answer key for the unit Activity Book, completes each Teacher Guide.


 - **Appendices** providing more detailed information about the program are sometimes included in the
Teacher Guide.


~~**UNIT 1 ORGANIZATION**~~


Unit 1 will be a review for students who completed the Grade 1 program. In Unit 1, students will review:
(1) a number of spellings from Grade 1 with an emphasis on consonant sounds; (2) one- and twosyllable words; and (3) a number of high-frequency Tricky Words. They will also read new decodable
stories from the Unit 1 Reader, _The Cat Bandit._


**Back-to-School Week Lessons (1–5)**


The Back-to-School lessons reacquaint students with the daily routines and exercises. In addition,
the Back-to-School lessons prepare students for the placement assessments that follow this week by
providing practice and review of reading skills and code knowledge.


**Placement Assessment Lessons (6–10)**


During this week, all students will participate in a comprehensive series of placement assessments
to evaluate their knowledge of the skills taught in the Grade 1 program. Detailed instructions are


Foundational Skills 1


provided for analyzing each student’s performance, along with suggestions for grade-wide planning
to determine the most effective and efficient way to group students for phonics instruction. **It is**
**imperative that students be placed in groups that correspond with their reading abilities.**
**Students must receive instruction that is a good match for their current reading abilities and**
**knowledge of the code.**


**Review of Spellings-to-Sounds Lessons (11–22)**


In most Skills lessons, instruction involves the teacher introducing sounds first, followed by teaching
the spellings for sounds. For example, a teacher would teach the sound /m/ before teaching the
spelling ‘m’. However, Grade 2 Units 1 and 2 are different as they feature instruction mainly oriented
from spelling to sound. For example, you will show students the letter ‘m’ and ask them “What sound
would you say if you saw this spelling in a word?” You will repeat this procedure to review many more
spellings throughout the Unit 1 lessons.


The presentation and practice of sound/spelling correspondences in these lessons, most of which
should be familiar to students who participated in the Grade 1 program, allows for a rapid review.
Although the pace is fast, it should be appropriate and helpful for students who have already
learned the bulk of these letter-sound correspondences, but may have forgotten some of the
correspondences over the summer.


However, the pace will be too rapid for students who know only a few of the letter-sound
correspondences. The Story Reading Assessment and the Word Reading Assessment that are
administered during Lessons 6–10 will identify students who struggle with recognizing these lettersound correspondences. Following administration of the placement assessments, any struggling
students should be regrouped and placed at an earlier point of the grade level materials for Skills
instruction.


~~**VOWEL SPELLINGS**~~


Vowel sounds are made with an open mouth and unobstructed flow of air. There are nineteen vowel
sounds in English, and five are quickly reviewed in Unit 1. These are the single-letter spellings for the
five “short” vowel sounds:


  - ‘o’ > /o/ ( _hop_ )


  - ‘e’ > /e/ ( _pet_ )


  - ‘a’ > /a/ ( _hat_ )


  - ‘i’ > /i/ ( _it_ )


  - ‘u’ > /u/ ( _but_ )


Introduction
**9**


**10**



In this unit, students are not asked to read words with vowel digraph spellings such as ‘ee’, ‘aw’, ‘oe’,
and ‘ai’. They also are not asked to cope with tricky spellings for vowel sounds, like the letter ‘a’ which
routinely stands for both /a/ ( _cat_ ), /ae/ ( _table_ ), /o/ ( _lava_ ), and schwa ( _about_ ). In the words and
stories students encounter in Unit 1, the letter ‘a’ is always pronounced /a/ as in _cat_ . The complexity
surrounding vowel sounds and spellings is much reduced in Unit 1 because only the five spellings
listed above are used.


~~**CONSONANT SPELLINGS**~~


In Unit 1, the following spellings for consonant sounds are reviewed rapidly:


 - ‘t’ > /t/ ( _top_ ), ‘tt’ > /t/ ( _sitting_ ), and ‘ed’ > /t/ ( _asked_ )


 - ‘d’ > /d/ ( _dot_ ), ‘dd’ > /d/ ( _add_ ), and ‘ed’ > /d/ ( _filled_ )


 - ‘p’ > /p/ ( _pot_ ) and ‘pp’ > /p/ ( _napping_ )


 - ‘b’ > /b/ ( _bat_ ) and ‘bb’ > /b/ ( _rubbing_ )


 - ‘c’ > /k/ ( _cat_ ), ‘k’ > /k/ ( _kid_ ), ‘cc’ > /k/ ( _hiccup_ ), and ‘ck’ > /k/ ( _black_ )


 - ‘g’ > /g/ ( _gift_ ) and ‘gg’ > /g/ ( _egg_ )


 - ‘ch’ > /ch/ ( _chin_ ) and ‘tch’ > /ch/ ( _itch_ )


 - ‘j’ > /g/ ( _jump_ ), ‘g’ > /g/ ( _gem_ ), and ‘ge’ > /ge/ ( _fringe_ )


 - ‘f’ > /f/ ( _fit_ ) and ‘ff’ > /f/ ( _stuff_ )


 - ‘v’ > /v/ ( _vet_ ) and ‘ve’ > /v/ ( _twelve_ )


 - ‘s’ > /s/ ( _sun_ ), ‘ss’ > /s/ ( _dress_ ), ‘c’ > /s/ ( _cent_ ), ‘se’ > /s/ ( _rinse_ ), and ‘ce’ > /s/ ( _prince_ )


 - ‘z’ > /z/ ( _zip_ ), ‘zz’ > /z/ ( _buzz_ ), and ‘s’ > /z/ ( _dogs_ )


 - ‘th’ > /th/ ( _thin_ ) as a spelling for (unvoiced) /th/


 - ‘th’ > /th/ ( _them_ ) as a spelling for (voiced) /th/


 - ‘m’ > /m/ ( _mad_ ) and ‘mm’ > /m/ ( _swimming_ )


 - ‘n’ > /n/ ( _nut_ ), ‘nn’ > /n/ ( _running_ ), and ‘kn’ > /n/ ( _knock_ )


 - ‘ng’ > /ng/ ( _sing_ ) and ‘n’ > /ng/ ( _pink_ )


 - ‘sh’ > /sh/ ( _shop_ )


 - ‘h’ > /h/ ( _hot_ )


Foundational Skills 1


  - ‘w’ > /w/ ( _wet_ ) and ‘wh’ > /w/ ( _when_ )


  - ‘l’ > /l/ ( _lip_ ) and ‘ll’ > /l/ ( _bell_ )


  - ‘r’ > /r/ ( _red_ ), ‘rr’ > /r/ ( _ferret_ ), and ‘wr’ > /r/ ( _wrist_ )


  - ‘y’ > /y/ ( _yes_ )


  - ‘x’ > /x/ ( _tax_ ) as a spelling for the sound combination /x/ (/k/ + /s/)


  - ‘qu’> /qu/ ( _quit_ ) as a spelling for the sound combination /qu/ (/k/ + /w/)


The list includes the basic code spelling for each consonant sound as well as some common spelling
alternatives. When a sound can be spelled more than one way, we say it has _spelling_ _alternatives_ . For
example, the sound /k/ can be spelled several different ways: _cat_, _kit_, _soccer_, and _rock_ are the four
spellings reviewed quickly in Unit 1.


The consonant list for Unit 1 also illustrates another kind of complexity in our writing system: the
existence of what we call _tricky_ _spellings_ . When a spelling can represent more than one sound, we say
it is a tricky spelling. For example, notice the tricky spelling ‘s’ can stand for /s/ as in _cats_ or /z/ as in
_dogs_ . Tricky spellings cause problems for us when we are reading. When we come upon an unfamiliar
printed word with an ‘s’ in it, we may need to try pronouncing the ‘s’ as /s/ and then as /z/ in order
to correctly identify the word. The list of consonant spellings also includes digraph (two-letter) and
trigraph (three-letter) spellings, such as: (1) ‘sh’ in _shop_ ; (2) ‘ng’ in _sing_ ; (3) ‘se’ in _rinse_ ; and (4) ‘tch’
as a spelling for /ch/ as in _itch_ .


In digraph spellings, two letters stand for one sound, but they are not the same two letters. You
may choose to teach students the terms _digraph_ and _trigraph_ . An alternative, which works for both
digraphs and trigraphs, is to characterize the letters as a “letter team,” where two or more letters work
together to stand for one sound. Whatever terms you use, it is extremely important for students to
understand a letter can stand for a single sound all by itself or it can work with other letters to stand
for a single sound. For example, when discussing the word _rinse_, you are encouraged to talk about how
the ‘s’ and the ‘e’ work together as a letter team to stand for the /s/ sound, just like the letters ‘t’ and
‘h’ work together to stand for the /th/ sound in the word _with_ .


The consonant sounds are listed in a particular order to help you learn more about the sounds. The
first fourteen consonants are unvoiced and voiced pairs such as /s/ and /z/, /f/ and /v/. When
comparing these sounds, you will notice your vocal box vibrates when saying voiced consonants,
while it does not with unvoiced consonants. The voiced and voiceless pairs sometimes “share”
spellings. For example,‘s’ is a spelling for the voiceless /s/ in _cats_ and the voiced /z/ in _dogs_ . Having
a deep understanding about the sounds of our language can help you explain sounds and spellings to
students.


Introduction
**11**


**12**



An understanding of the sounds of the language and the similarities among them can also help you
understand students’ spelling. Sometimes even the strangest-looking “invented” spellings make sense
if you understand which sounds are similar to other sounds. Young children often misspell a word
by choosing a spelling for a sound that is similar to the sound they are trying to spell. For example, a
student who writes _chump_ for _jump_ has confused sounds made with the same mouth position. The
‘ch’ spelling can therefore be seen as closer to the correct spelling than we might initially assume.


~~**REVIEW OF TRICKY WORDS**~~


The term _Tricky Word_ is used in this program to refer to a word not pronounced quite the way you
would expect based on the letters in its printed form, or is not spelled quite the way you would expect
based on the sounds in the spoken word. Students will review the Tricky Words _a_, _the_, _he_, _she_, _we_, _be_,
_me_, _was_, _of_, _from_, _to_, _do_, _down_, _how_, _what_, _where_, _why_, _once_, _one_, _two_, _could_, _would_, _should_, _there_, _said_,
_says_, and _word_ . These words were taught in Kindergarten and Grade 1 of the program, so they should
be familiar to students who had the program last year. These words are used so often they are likely to
be familiar to students who were in other programs as well.


A few words should be said about “sight words.” The term _sight_ _word_ is often used to describe a
common word students should practice reading and learn to recognize rapidly. At the same time, a
sight word may describe a Tricky Word. It is necessary to distinguish between words that are genuinely
tricky (words like _one_, _of_, _two_, _who_, and _could_ ) and words that are high-frequency but pronounced as
expected (words like _in_, _at_, _on_, _this_, _that_, and _up_ ). Words in this last category should not be taught as
Tricky Words because there is actually nothing tricky about them. They can be read via blending, and
students should be encouraged to read them that way. (See Appendix A for more detailed information
about Tricky Words.)


~~**REVIEW OF TWO-SYLLABLE WORDS**~~


Two-syllable words are reviewed in Unit 1 lessons. However, few two-syllable words are used in the
Reader in order to keep readability levels as easy as possible for this first Reader in Grade 2.


Foundational Skills 1


~~**REVIEW OF ROOT WORDS WITH THE SUFFIX –ING AND PAST TENSE SUFFIX –ED**~~


Spelling patterns for adding the suffixes – _ing_ and – _ed_ to root words are reviewed. Students will also
review the pronunciation of the past tense suffix – _ed_ (the suffix – _ed_ is also referred to as the past
tense marker and the past tense ending). It can be pronounced three different ways:


  - /e/ + /d/ when it follows the /t/ sound or the /d/ sound, like _busted_ or _added_


  - /t/ when it follows a voiceless sound, like _kicked_ or _huffed_


  - /d/ when it follows a voiced sound, like _planned_ or _strummed_


Often the mouth will guide students to the correct pronunciation. Spelling may take longer to come
into focus. Some students may initially produce faulty past tense forms like _markt_ and _plannd_ .


~~**A NOTE ON SPELLING, GRAMMAR, AND WRITING**~~


**Spelling:** Because students are still learning spellings for sounds, it is not appropriate to expect
perfect spelling at this point. Students’ abilities to spell the letter-sound correspondences taught will
lag behind their ability to read. In students’ daily writing, you should continue to accept phonemically
plausible spelling (e.g., _hed_ for _head_, _hunnee_ for _honey_, _cot_ or _cawt_ for _caught_ ).


It is, however, important for students to understand that conventional spelling is expected for written
work completed by adults and older students. In Grade 2, students are helped to make this transition
with weekly spelling assessments. Students will receive spelling word lists to take home and practice
at the beginning of the week. These words include the sound/spelling correspondences students have
learned and reviewed, as well as Tricky Words. Students will be assessed on these same words at the
end of each week.


In Unit 1, the spelling words should be very easy for Grade 2 students as only words spelled with
the basic code will be given as spelling words. Starting in Unit 2, the spelling words will become
more challenging as they begin to include various spelling alternatives. The inclusion of the spelling
alternatives will mean, in order to be successful on the weekly spelling assessment, students must
practice the way these particular words are spelled.


During writing activities, students will have an opportunity to practice correctly spelling highfrequency words and words with sound-spellings they have learned. Refer to the scope and sequence
as needed to determine if the sound-spelling has been previously taught, and focus on those words
in there when reviewing their writing. Many writing assignments also use an editing checklist, so
students should be checking their spelling before submitting their assignment.


Introduction
**13**


**14**



Students will also create a Dictation Journal that focuses on spelling words in isolation as well as in
sentences. Spelling assessments will also incorporate a phrase or sentence that students must spell
correctly.


  - For the dictation journal, you can either have students use a journal they use for other writing
activities or you may wish to create a small dictation journal for each student. Stapling five pieces of
paper together is all you will need for each journal. (1) ~~**TEKS 2.2.C.i; TEKS 2.2.C.iv**~~


**Grammar:** Unit 1 will review the basics of sentence building, punctuation, and capitalization.


  - Students may also practice decoding and spelling abbreviations for days of the week and months of
the year.


  - Display the word _Monday_ and the abbreviation _Mon._ Point to _Monday_ and say, “An abbreviation is a
short way to write a full word. It usually begins with a capital letter and ends with a period. Types of
words that may be abbreviated include days of the week, months of the year, titles before names,
measurements, streets in addresses, and states. For example, the word _Monday_ can be written in a
shorter form as a capital _M_ and _on_ with a period at the end.” [Point to _Mon._ ]


  - Display the following words: Jan., Sept., Fri., Sat. Have the students work in small groups to decode
the words and identify the long form of each of the words. Provide assistance as needed. Then have
students write the current date, including the day of the week, month, day, and year.

~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iv; TEKS 2.2.C.iii**~~


**Writing:** Within the Skills Strand, students also receive instruction in the writing composition process.
In Unit 1, students will review/practice writing complete sentences when answering questions.
Instruction in later units will include explicit instruction for writing in different genres.


~~**FOUNDATIONAL ORAL LANGUAGE**~~


Across the grade level, students will have multiple opportunities to follow, restate, and give oral
instructions. Explain to students that following instructions is important because it’s something we do
every day in different places. At home, students follow family members’ instructions to do chores. At
school, they follow your instructions to learn and work together. At recess or in the park, they follow
instructions to learn new games. Explain that to follow instructions, students need to learn to pay
attention and listen carefully.


  - Ask students for their attention, and make sure the classroom is quiet. Give students one- and twostep instructions to follow, such as “Get a sheet of paper from the front of the room.” Clearly state
your instruction.


  - Then ask students to restate, or repeat back, the instruction to you.


**TEKS 2.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling one-syllable words with closed syllables; open syllables: VCe syllables: vowel teams,
including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables, and final stable syllables; (iii) spelling compound words, contractions, and common abbreviations; (iv)
spelling multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns; **TEKS 2.2.B.iv** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by: decoding compound words,
contractions, and common abbreviations.


Foundational Skills 1


  - Next, explain to students that it’s important to be clear when giving oral instructions to someone
else. If you want someone to be successful in completing a task, your instructions should be given in
a logical order, have details, and be concise, meaning giving a lot of information in a few words.


  - Provide an example of giving directions, such as “Put your right hand on top of your head, then hop in
place one time.” Have students restate the instruction.


  - Divide students into groups. Have students take turns giving two-step directions to their group
members, such as “Take a green crayon and draw a circle in the center of your paper” or “Put your
hands on your knees and then touch your shoulders.”


  - Repeat these steps throughout the unit to confirm students can follow, restate, and give instructions
for a wide range of activities. ~~**TEKS 2.1.B**~~


~~**READER: THE CAT BANDIT**~~


The Reader for Unit 1 is _The Cat Bandit_ . The stories tell of the adventures of a hungry cat and the
increasingly clever ways he gets food items seemingly out of his reach. The stories in this Reader
are 100% decodable, meaning they are made up entirely of spellings and Tricky Words introduced or
reviewed quickly in class during previous lessons.


The stories in _The Cat Bandit_ are short and quite simple. They are designed to help students ease back
into reading. The length and complexity of the stories will increase as students review more lettersound correspondences. There will be a significant increase in length from the Unit 1 Reader to the
Unit 2 Reader.


It is strongly recommended that you have students engage in partner reading. Partner reading
involves two students taking turns reading both new and old stories aloud to each other. The National
Reading Panel (2000) found that repeated oral reading boosted reading achievement, and partner
reading is an efficient way to conduct repeated oral reading. Planning and establishing a partner
reading routine with students will help this activity run smoothly; you should take into consideration:
(1) where students will partner read in the classroom; (2) good partner reading manners, such as
taking turns; and (3) what to do when students finish reading a story before other partner pairs.


In addition to partner reading, there are other effective oral reading methods. Some suggestions are:


  - Whole group reading
Students follow along as classmates take turns reading aloud. However, avoid “Round Robin” reading.


  - Small group reading
Some students can read aloud in a small group with the teacher, while other students partner read or
engage in other activities.


**TEKS 2.1.B** Follow, restate, and give oral instructions that involve a short, related sequence of actions.


Introduction
**15**


**16**



During reading time, it is important to circulate and listen to students read. Utilize the provided Anecdotal
Reading Record located in the Teacher Resources section at the end of this Teacher Guide to note
students’ progress. You can make multiple copies of the blank record to have on hand when listening to
students read aloud. You should strive to hear every student read aloud at least once or twice each week.


Comprehension is the goal of learning to read. To this end, comprehension discussion questions are
included in the Teacher Guide. The discussion questions are labeled _Literal_, _Inferential_, or _Evaluative_ .
Literal questions can be answered by citing a specific text reference or illustration. Inferential questions
require understanding and interpretation of text or illustrations. Evaluative questions require students to
access prior knowledge, synthesize, and hypothesize an answer. In addition, activity pages with written
comprehension questions for students to complete are also included for many stories.


~~**UNIT 1 ASSESSMENT**~~


**Placement Assessment**


As noted earlier, a comprehensive placement assessment of prerequisite skills needed for successful
participation in Grade 2 instruction will be administered to all students during Lessons 6–10 of
this unit. Detailed information about these assessments and how to administer them is provided
immediately preceding Lesson 6. Detailed information on scoring, analyzing, and interpreting student
performance for grouping and placement purposes is provided immediately following Lesson 10.


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


Throughout this unit, formative assessments are clearly marked for monitoring individual student
performance and progress in key skills. Quick “Checks for Understanding” to evaluate classroom
performance as a whole are also designated in various lessons.


Careful attention to this information, collected on a daily basis, will enable teachers to quickly
determine which students may benefit from reteaching and/or more practice in particular skills using
the Additional Support activities found at the end of each lesson.


**Student Performance Assessment**


In Lesson 22, you will be prompted to administer a multipart end-of-unit assessment. Students will be
asked to independently read a new story in _The Cat Bandit_ and then answer written comprehension
questions about the selection.


During the Word Recognition Assessment, students will be asked to look at several words on the
designated activity page and then circle the written word which matches the spoken word you say. The
distractors included represent frequent sound/spelling confusions.


Foundational Skills 1


Additional activity pages will be used to assess students’ skill in adding suffixes to root words and in
correctly punctuating sentences.


During this assessment, students will be asked to print legibly. Look for and assess students’ ability to
form letters accurately.


~~**CURSIVE WRITING**~~


Some lessons in this unit contain instruction in cursive writing. Throughout the skills units, students
will be provided with a solid introduction to the lower-and-upper-case cursive alphabet with
accompanying Activity Book pages. This practice gives second graders new to cursive the time to
develop these skills and a timely refresher to more experienced students.


The lessons are designed to be completed in 10 minutes. Teachers should proceed at a pace that is
right for their classes, allowing new students of cursive to become comfortable writing each letter or
letter group before introducing new ones. Students reviewing cursive can sharpen their penmanship
skills with periodic assignments from the Activity Book. Once students have learned all the letters,
have them practice by completing select writing assignments in cursive.


Note that the lessons and activity pages do not comprise an exhaustive handwriting program, and
teachers may wish to consult other sources for information on topics such as writing posture, pencil
grip, and differentiated instruction for left-handed students.


**Left-Handed Cursive Guidance**


Left-handed writers need to grip the writing instrument far enough back from the point to see what is
being written and not smear what has just been written. Have students grip the pencil around 1 to 1.5
inches from the point.


Have students tilt their paper so their arm is at a right angle to the bottom edge. This will allow the
wrist to sit at a natural arc while writing.


Have students write with their hands below the writing line and the wrist straight.


Immediately correct students who use a ‘hooked’ style of writing, because this may cause strain
to the wrist.


Allow your left-handed students to hold their pen or pencil with a relaxed grip, as gripping too tightly
can cause hand fatigue and strain.


Introduction
**17**


**18**



Encourage your left-handed students to slant their writing to the left rather than to the right. This will
help them write more smoothly and with less smudging.


Model cursive letter formation for your left-handed students, showing them how to form each letter
from the left to right.


Provide your left-handed students with plenty of practice time as they develop their skills.


~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice the Unit 1 skills can be found in the
Pausing Point section included after the last lesson.


~~**APPENDICES**~~


Unit 1 includes three appendices that provide additional information about the Grade 2 program.
Appendix A, “An Overview of the Skills Strand,” explains the philosophy and theoretical principles
that underlie the approach to teaching reading. Appendix B, “Grade 2 Scope and Sequence” provides
an overview of the skills taught in each of the Grade 2 units. Appendix C, “Using Chunking to Decode
Multisyllable Words,” provides an explanation of the manner in which students learned to use
chunking, or syllabication, to read longer, multisyllable words in Grade 1. Students will continue to use
this same approach in Grade 2.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


In this section at the end of the Teacher Guide, you will find forms and charts which may be useful,
including the following:


 - Grade 2 Individual Code Chart


 - Placement Planning Sheet—Unit 1


 - Word Reading Assessment Word List—Unit 1


 - Anecdotal Reading Record—Unit 1


 - Discussion Questions Observation Record—Unit 1


 - Sample Cat Bandit Chart

  - Appendix B: Grade 2 Scope and Sequence


  - Appendix C: Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words


~~**ADDITIONAL MATERIALS**~~


Some additional materials (most typically available in Grade 2 classrooms) are needed for specific
lessons of Unit 1. These materials are always listed in the Lesson at a Glance chart at the beginning of
each lesson. For your convenience, a complete list of these additional materials is included here. The
number in parentheses indicates the first lesson in which the materials are used:


  - thin-tipped green and red markers for each student (1)


  - notebooks/writing paper and pencils for each student (1)


  - unruled 4” x 6” or 5” x 7” yellow index cards (11)


  - unruled 4” x 6” or 5” x 7” white or green index cards (13)


  - digital components: Throughout this unit and others, whenever the lesson suggests the teacher
model the completion of an activity page or prepare a chart to display, you may use the digital
version in the program’s online materials. (1)


  - dictation journal: In Lessons 1–5, students will write dictated words. As a reminder, you can either
have students use a dictation journal for other writing activities or you may wish to create a small
dictation journal for each student. Stapling five pieces of paper together is all you will need for each
journal. (1)


  - User Guide: You may wish to consult the program’s User Guide throughout this unit and others for
best practices and strategies on **Supporting All Learners** including Emergent Bilingual Students,
Gifted/Talented Students, Dual Language Students, and Students with Disabilities. The User Guide
can be found in the program’s online materials. (1)

Foundational Skills 1


###### Back-to-School Week

After the summer break, all students need time to reacclimate to the school environment. The Backto-School lessons are designed to provide just such an opportunity for students. They will also provide
an opportunity to begin to get to know students as you observe the skills they use to complete these
review lessons in which no new skills are introduced.


These Back-to-School lessons (Lessons 1–5) have been created to help students remember the daily
routines and exercises associated with the program. Very basic skills from Kindergarten and Grade 1
are reviewed in these lessons, with reading selections drawn from a Grade 1 Reader. The selection of
material for use in these lessons, which includes skills that all students should have already mastered,
is intentional, so the primary focus is on familiarization with the routines and pacing of a typical Skills
lesson, rather than learning new skills. In addition to reacquainting students with these routines,
the lessons are also designed to ensure the results of the placement assessments administered in
Lessons 6–10 accurately reflect the reading skills and code knowledge that students mastered at the
end of the last school year.


Please take the time to teach these procedures thoroughly, making sure you present at least part
of every exercise in each lesson. Use the time recommendations for each exercise as a guideline. If
you find you have exceeded the time estimated for the initial activities in a lesson, please adjust the
remaining exercises accordingly by doing fewer items per exercise.


For example, you may find you do not have time, especially in the first lesson(s), to model how to
respond to every question on the story comprehension activity pages. In this case, model responses
to several questions, but do not feel compelled to complete all of the questions on the activity page.
Remember that the point of these Back-to-School lessons is to remind students of the routines.
If necessary, do fewer items per exercise, but try to do all exercises in every lesson.


As students relearn the procedures, your presentation of each lesson will become more efficient. Do
not get frustrated in these first days if it takes a little longer to do portions of the lessons. It will come
back to students and everyone will benefit from the time taken to establish a routine.


The following exercises are included in each Back-to-School lesson:


**Code Flip Book and Individual Code Chart Review**


Students who participated in the program in Kindergarten and Grade 1 are very familiar with the
introduction and review of letter-sound correspondences using the same format incorporated in the
Grade 2 Code Flip Books and Individual Code Chart. In Grade 2, code information is presented to
students using two instructional tools: (1) Code Flip Books for group instruction, one for consonants
and one for vowels, and (2) the Individual Code Chart, one for each student.


Introduction
**21**


The Code Flip Books are used with a set of Spelling Cards affixed to the appropriate Code Flip Book
pages as sounds and spellings are reviewed in Unit 1. The Code Flip Books show (in gray print) the
spellings for all sounds taught in Grade 2. As you review the sounds in this unit (and introduce new
sounds in the later Grade 2 units), you will be asked to place the Spelling Card on the appropriate
Code Flip Book page.


Each Spelling Card is printed front and back. One side of the card shows the sound:





**22**



The other side of the card shows three things:


The top of the card shows the spelling. The bottom shows a sample word containing the spelling.
In the middle is a power bar. The power bar gives an indication of how common this spelling is for
the sound it represents. A long power bar stretching almost across the card means this is the main
spelling for the sound and that there are very few English words that have this sound spelled any other
way. A very short power bar means the spelling is less common and occurs in fewer English words.


Foundational Skills 1


The Code Flip Book and Individual Code Chart exercises in the Back-to-School lessons will introduce
students to the use of both of these new tools, as well as provide a very rapid review of the lettersound correspondences taught in the earlier grade levels.


**Note:** The exercises in the Back-to-School lessons are not designed to teach letter-sound
correspondences to students who have not mastered the code in earlier grades. Students who have
large gaps in their code knowledge will be identified through the placement assessments presented
during Lessons 6–10 of this unit so they can be placed in the appropriate level of materials that meets
their individual instructional needs.


As noted earlier, the Back-to-School lessons are intended to “prime the pump,” reminding students to
think about letter-sound correspondences and the written English code after the summer break. Keep
the Code Flip Book and Individual Code Chart exercises briskly paced so they do not become tedious.


Do encourage students to use their Individual Code Charts whenever they are reading and/or writing
throughout the day, not just during the Skills instruction portion of the language arts block. This
reinforces applying the skills they are learning during language arts whenever they are reading
and writing.


To take full advantage of the Individual Code Chart (see sample in Teacher Resources), it is important
that you and students understand the logic with which the various letter-sound correspondences have
been grouped on the Individual Code Chart:


  - The spellings for each sound are arranged in left to right order on the Individual Code Chart, from the
most frequent way the sound is spelled to the least frequent way the sound is spelled.


    - For example, on Chart 1, the left to right sequence of the spellings for the /t/ sound indicate that
the most frequent spelling for /t/ is ‘t’, with the spelling alternatives ‘tt’ and ‘ed’ being less common
spellings. Note that this same information is communicated by the length of the power bar.


  - Consonant sounds are grouped separately from vowel sounds.


  - Consonant sounds resembling one another are often included on the same chart. For example, Code
Charts 1–4 show voiced and unvoiced consonant sounds and similar spellings.


  - Code Charts 5–6 include all of the remaining, unrelated consonant sounds and spellings.


  - Spellings for short vowel sounds are included on Code Chart 7, with the spellings for long vowel
sounds on Code Chart 8. Code Chart 9 groups all of the vowel digraph spellings and Code Chart 10
includes the spellings for r-controlled vowels.


Introduction
**23**


**24**



**Chaining**


Students have been completing chaining exercises since the earliest Kindergarten units. This critical
activity reinforces students’ abilities to manipulate the sounds in words in which only a single
phoneme/grapheme is changed (added or deleted) at a time, like _cat_ - _hat_ ; _cat_ - _cab_ ; _at_ - _hat_ ; or
_cat_ - _at_ .


In the early grades, students chained by manipulating individual letter cards on either an individual
Chaining Folder or a group pocket chart. In Grade 2, chaining activities are completed either by the
teacher or student writing on a blackboard, a whiteboard, a Smart Board, or chart paper.


During the Back-to-School lessons, present each chaining exercise exactly as it is written. It is
important that these chaining exercises be presented at a brisk pace. Remember that the soundsymbol correspondences being chained are basic Kindergarten skills that all students should have
already mastered. These lessons are not the time to attempt to remediate skill deficits. If you notice
some students struggling, make a note of those students who seem to have difficulty. Analyze those
students’ performance on the Word Reading Assessment in Lessons 6–10 in particular.


**Dictation**


A simple dictation exercise in each lesson is included to remind students about the connection
between decoding and encoding (i.e., reading and writing). Encourage students to actively and openly
refer to their Individual Code Charts, if needed, during this portion of the lesson.


Once the dictation is completed, review and model the correct spelling for each word and instruct
students to correct their own work by simply crossing out any incorrect spelling, then copying and
writing the correct spelling next to it. There should be no stigma associated with having spelled a
word incorrectly. Teachers may want to comment that it’s normal to make mistakes, especially at the
beginning of the year. Emphasize the importance of recognizing and understanding when a mistake
has been made and correcting the error.


It is recommended that students complete dictation exercises in a notebook, which offers the
advantage of providing an ongoing written record of each student’s work.


**Oral Reading**


Practice stories for students to read aloud during the Back-to-School lessons are included in the
student Activity Book. These selections are from the Grade 1, Unit 5 Reader, _Kate’s Book_ . Although
these stories were excerpted from the Grade 1 Reader, some students may find them to be challenging
on the heels of summer vacation. In addition, a few special Tricky Words are introduced to better tell
the story of Kate and her Navajo heritage. The special Tricky Words will be introduced at the beginning
of each story where they appear. Please go over these words with students before reading each
story. These special Tricky Words will not be added to the regular Tricky Word instruction or review.


Foundational Skills 1


Therefore, the Back-to-School stories are read aloud chorally with the entire class. You will read (solo)
some parts of the story aloud as students listen and follow along. The entire class will then join you
from time to time in reading a sentence or two aloud together.


Please note that since these stories are excerpted from a mid-Grade 1 Reader, two syllable words are
visually divided for students with a dot: _vis_  - _it_, _cab_  - _in_, _kitch_  - _en_ . Remind students that these dots were
included in their Grade 1 Readers to help them read longer words. The text in the new Grade 2 Reader,
_The Cat Bandit_, will not include these prompts. **Note:** For more information on how students are
taught to use chunking or syllabication in reading multisyllable words, see Appendix C in this
Teacher Guide.


The point of reading these stories chorally is to ensure a measure of reading success and enjoyment in
the opening days of school. Once you have practiced reading the stories in class, you are encouraged
to send the story activity page(s) home for students to read aloud with their families.


**Story Comprehension**


Each practice story in the Back-to-School lessons is accompanied by a story comprehension
activity page. These activity pages are similar to those in the Grade 1 materials and are also similar to
the assessment story questions students will be asked to complete during assessment
in Lessons 6–10.


As with the other Back-to-School exercises, the purpose of these activity pages is to reacquaint
students with procedures used to answer story questions and complete activity pages. You will note
the lesson directs you to model this for students. Please be sure to model the responses to several
story comprehension questions in each lesson. As noted earlier, if there is not sufficient time to
model and complete all of the questions, especially in the early lessons, model responses to just a few
questions, instead of completing them all.


Please do not skip the modeling and simply assign students to complete the questions entirely on
their own at this point in the year.


Throughout this unit and others, whenever the lesson suggests the teacher model the completion of
an activity page, you should choose the most convenient and effective method of reproducing and
displaying the activity page for all to see. This may include making a transparency of the activity page
and using an overhead projector, scanning the page and projecting it on a Smart Board, or writing the
activity page exercises on the board/chart paper.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


The primary focus on the Back-to-School lessons is to familiarize students
with the lesson routines and activities, rather than to teach specific skills.
It is highly recommended that you use this week to collect information and
data about each student, including tasks and skills they perform easily, as
well as any areas of potential difficulty. This information will be a useful
supplement to the data from the Placement Assessment in Lessons 6–10.


No Additional Support activities are recommended for the Back-to-School
lessons in light of the very basic skill review.


**Foundational Skills**

 - Prepare to display the Vowel and Consonant Code Flip Books within view of
all students; also have the Spelling Cards listed in the Lesson at a Glance
chart, student Individual Code Charts, and green and red markers readily
available.


 - Prepare your preferred medium for Teacher Chaining: board, whiteboard,
Smart Board, or chart paper. You will use this medium for all chaining
activities.


**Reading**

) **Digital Components 1.1, 1.2**


 - Prepare to display the story “Kate Visits Doba” found on Activity Page 1.1.
(Digital Component 1.1) and the story questions on Activity Page 1.2 (Digital
Component 1.2) in your chosen format.


 - The special Tricky Words for today’s story are Doba, pronounced
/d/ /oe/ • /b/ /a/ or doe • buh; Sani, pronounced /s/ /o/ • /n/ /i/
or sah • neh. In Navajo the ‘ni’ sound would be breathy sound like letter ‘i’
in the word _is_ ; and Gad, pronounced /g/ /u/ /d/. Students may have
difficulty pronouncing the name so /g/ /a/ /d/ is also acceptable.
Have students practice reading and saying the words several times
before reading.


**Universal Access**

 - Prepare to make a list of the names students call their grandmothers prior to
reading the story “Kate Visits Doba.”


 - Gather images of people hiking to provide context for students as they read
the story.

~~**WARM-UP (10 MIN.)**~~


**Rhyming Words**

  - Ask students to identify the first sound and the ending sound of the word _pie._


  - Invite students to close their eyes and repeat the word. Isolate the beginning
sound of the word if needed and repeat; say /p/ /ie/.


  - Tell students to find a rhyming word or rhyming words, we need to change
the first sound and keep the ending sound (e.g., _lie_, _my_ ).


  - Direct students to the alphabet posted in the classroom to use as a reference
for beginning sounds.


  - Invite students to use blends and digraphs they have learned to make
rhymes (e.g., _shy_, _fry_, _try_, _cry_, _thigh_, _dry_ ).


  - Repeat this process with the word _bake._


**Code Flip Book Review**


**Note:** This activity reviews previously learned long and short vowels in onesyllable words as a way to introduce the procedure of using Code Flip Books
and Charts.


**TEKS 2.2.A** Demonstrate phonological awareness by (i) producing a series of rhyming words; (iii) recognizing the change
in spoken word when a specific phoneme is added, changed, or removed; **TEKS 2.2.B.i** Demonstrate and apply phonetic
knowedge by decoding words with short, long, or varient vowels, trigraphs and blends; **TEKS 2.2.C.i** Demonstrate and apply

Explain that the sounds
/i/ and /a/ are made
with the mouth open.
Demonstrate that to make
the /i/ sound, we open
our mouth just a little bit
and gently push air out.
To make the /a/ sound,
we open our mouth even
more and gently push air
out. Have students put
their hand under their
chins so they can feel their
mouths opening wider
with each new sound. As
they make each sound,
display the appropriate
Spelling Card.


~~**ELPS 1.B**~~

**29**


Code Materials



**Vowel Code Flip Book**


1. ‘a’ > /a/ _(hat_ ) **page 1**


2. ‘i’ > /i/ ( _it_ ) **page 2**


- Show students the /a/ Spelling Card with the ‘a’ _hat_ side facing them. Point
to the ‘a’ and ask students to name the letter. Then read the word _hat_ and
remind them that the letter ‘a’ is used to spell and write /a/ in English words.


- Remind students that /a/ is a vowel sound. Explain that vowel sounds will
always be written in green on the Spelling Cards because when we say a
vowel sound, we open our mouth, letting the air “go.”


- Point out the power bar below the spelling of ‘a’ and remind students this
bar indicates how common the spelling is. If the card shows a very common
spelling for a sound—a spelling used in lots and lots of words—there will be
a long power bar on the card, stretching almost across the entire card. If
the card shows a less common spelling for this sound—a spelling used in a
smaller number of words—the card will have a shorter power bar.


- Point to the power bar under ‘a’ and ask students whether they think the
letter ‘a’ is a very common spelling or a less common spelling for /a/.


- Turn to **page 1** of the **Vowel Code Flip Book** and point to the “sound bubble”
for /a/ on the page, and then point to the outline for the Spelling Card, placing
the ‘a’ Spelling Card on the appropriate place on the Code Flip Book page.


- Repeat the previous steps with the ‘i’ Spelling Card ( **page 2** of the **Vowel**
**Code Flip Book** ).


- Explain that students will each have their own Individual Code Chart that is
similar to the Code Flip Books.


- Give each student an Individual Code Chart and a green marker. Ask them to
write their name in the blank at the bottom of the page.


- The letter-sound correspondences for /a/ and /i/ can be found on the
following page of the Individual Code Chart.


**Individual Code Chart**


1. ‘a’ > /a/ _(hat_ ) **page 7**


2. ‘i’ > /i/ ( _it_ ) **page 7**


Foundational Skills 1



**30**


- Ask students to turn to **Individual Code Chart page 7** . Point to the sound
bubble for /a/ in the Code Flip Book and ask students to find the row on their
chart that begins with /a/. Point out that this row looks like the row on the
Code Flip Book page.


- Tell students to point to the spot in the row on their chart showing the ‘a’
spelling for /a/ as in _hat_ .


- Next, tell students to use their green marker to trace just this specific
rectangular card outline and the letter ‘a’ on the chart. Monitor to be sure all
students are tracing the correct card.


- Prompt students to summarize the code information conveyed by this card
on their chart. _(This tells us /a/ is spelled as the letter ‘a’ in written words. The_
_long power bar tells us it is a very common spelling.)_ **Note:** In fact, it is the
only spelling for /a/; this information can be deduced based on the fact that
there are no other spots on the chart in this row for other ways to spell /a/.


- Repeat all the steps with the /i/ spelling on the same chart page. Then
collect the green markers.


- Using the same procedure used for the Vowel Code Flip Book, review the
following consonant letter-sound correspondences.


**Consonant Code Flip Book**



**EMERGENT**
**BILINGUAL**
**STUDENTS**


Foundational Skills


**Foundational Literacy Skills**


Point out which consonant
sounds in each pair are
voiced and unvoiced: /p/
(unvoiced)—/b/ (voiced);
/t/ (unvoiced)—/d/
(voiced). Explain that
sounds in each pair are
similar to each other,
which is why these sounds
and spellings are grouped
together on the Individual
Code Chart. Have students
place a hand on their
throat and say the sound
/p/. Ask them if they feel
any vibration, or buzz on
their hand. Explain that
there is no buzz because
the /p/ sound is unvoiced.
Next, have students repeat
this process but with the
sound /b/. Help students
understand that there is
a buzz because the /b/
sound is made by the
throat.


~~**ELPS 1.B**~~



1. ‘p’ > /p/ ( _pot_ ) **page 1**


2. ‘b’ > /b/ ( _bat)_ **page 2**



3. ‘t’ > /t/ ( _top_ ) **page 3**


4. ‘d’ > /d/ ( _dot_ ) **page 4**




- Turn to **page 1** in the **Consonant Code Flip Book** . Show students the /p/
Spelling Card with the ‘p’ _pot_ facing students.


- Point to the ‘p’ and ask students to name the letter. Then read the word _pot_
and remind them the letter ‘p’ can be used to spell /p/ in English words.


- Remind them /p/ is a consonant sound; consonant sounds will always be
written in red on the Spelling Cards because when we say a consonant sound,
parts of our mouth touch or are closed, blocking or “stopping” some of the air.


- Point to the power bar under the ‘p’ and ask students whether they think the
letter ‘p’ is a very common spelling or a less common spelling for /p/.


- Now point to the sound bubble for /p/ on the Code Flip Book page and then
the outline for the Spelling Card, showing students that this is where you will
place the ‘p’ Spelling Card for /p/ on the Code Flip Book page.



Lesson 1 Back-to-School: Basic Code Review
**31**


- Give each student a red marker and have students turn to **Individual Code**
**Chart page 1** .


- Ask students to find the row on their chart that begins with /p/. Ask them to trace
just this rectangular card outline and the letter ‘p’ on their Individual Code Chart.


- Repeat all the steps with all of the remaining consonant Spelling Cards for
/b/, /t/, and /d/.


**Individual Code Chart**



1. ‘p’ > /p/ ( _pot_ ) **page 1**


2. ‘b’ > /b/ ( _bat)_ **page 1**

~~**TEACHER CHAINING (10 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.2.A.iii; TEKS 2.1.B**~~


  - Say the word _bad_ followed by the word _bat_ . Ask students which sound changed.


  - You will chain the following words on whatever medium you have selected.


1. at > ad > dad > pad > tad > bad > bat


2. it > bit > pit > pat > bat > bad


  - Tell students you are going to write the word _at_ .


  - As you write the word _at_, use think-aloud strategies to describe the steps
involved in writing the word:


    - “Let’s see, I want to write the word _at_ . First I have to say and listen to the
sounds: /a/. . . /t/. There are two sounds in the word _at_ . I’ll need to write a
spelling for each of these sounds. So first I will write the spelling or letter
for /a/ because it is the first sound. Then I will write the spelling or letter
for /t/ because it is the next sound.”


  - Use think-aloud strategies to describe the steps involved in reading the word:


    - “If I want to read the word, I need to start at the left, look at the first letter,
and then remember and say the sound it stands for. Then I need to look
at the next letter and say the sound it stands for. Then I blend the sounds
together to read and say the word: /a/. . . /t/. . . _at_ .”


  - Ask students to segment and then blend the word _at_ .


**TEKS 2.2.A.iii** Demonstrate phonological awareness by recognizing the change in spoken word when a specified phoneme
is added, changed, or removed; **TEKS 2.1.B** Follow, restate, and give oral instructions that involve a short, related sequence
of actions.


Foundational Skills 1


 - Explain you can make a new word by changing, taking away, or adding a
single letter/sound unit.


 - Erase ‘t’ and write ‘d’ to create _ad_ . As you make this change, say, “If this is _at_,
what is this?” Encourage all students to respond orally.


 - Continue this process as you complete the chains.


~~**DICTATION (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students they are to write the words you say in their dictation journals.
Read the first word, use it in a sentence, and then read the word only once
more, allowing time for students to write. Remind students to refer to their
Individual Code Chart as they write.


 - Have students repeat the instructions for dictation back to you before you
begin the activity.


 - Use this procedure with each of these words.


_bat_ _pad_ _tap_


After all the words have been called out, tell students you will now show
them the correct spelling for each word, so they can correct their own work.


 - Say and write each word on the board, instructing students to correct their
work by crossing out any incorrect spelling, then copying and writing the
correct spelling next to it. You may wish to consider modeling use of the
Individual Code Chart as you complete this exercise.


 - Reassure students that it’s normal to make mistakes, especially at the
beginning of the year. What is important is recognizing and understanding
when a mistake has been made and then correcting the error.


Observation: Dictation Journal


Look over students’ dictation journals and note the names of students who did not

successfully write each word the first time, as well as the types of errors made. These

are very basic sound/spelling correspondences taught in Kindergarten. Observe

whether students who made errors today have similar, generic difficulties on other

dictation exercises during the remaining Back-to-School lessons—an indication that

the Grade 2 materials may not be a good instructional fit for these students—or

whether there are only a few isolated sound/spelling errors.

mouth open. Explain that to
pronounce /e/, open your
mouth wide and make the
/e/ sound by pushing the
sound out from the back
of your throat. Notice how
your mouth isn’t as wide
open as it is when making
the /a/ sound. To make
the /u/ sound, open your
mouth and teeth just a little
and push out the sound
from the back of your

- Remember to prompt students to summarize the code information conveyed
by each of these new cards on their chart:


  - “This tells us /e/ is spelled as the letter ‘e’ in written words. The power bar
tells us ‘e’ is a common spelling, but there are other ways to also spell /e/.”


- Collect the green markers.

Code Materials



1. get > pet > pat > bat > cat > cot > tot > top


2. got > cot > cut > cup > cub > cab > cap


 - Tell students you are going to write the word _get_ .


 - As you write the word _get_, use think-aloud strategies to describe the steps
involved in writing the word:


   - “Let’s see, I want to write the word _get_ . First I have to say and listen to the
sounds: /g/. . . /e/. . . /t/. There are three sounds in the word _get_ . I’ll need
to write a spelling for each of the sounds. So first I will write the spelling or
letter for /g/ because it is the first sound. Then I will write the spelling or
letter for /e/ because it is the next sound. And then I will write the spelling
or letter for /t/ because it is the last sound.”


 - Use think-aloud strategies to describe the steps involved in reading the word:


   - “If I want to read the word, I need to start at the left, look at the first letter,
and then remember and say the sound it stands for. Then I need to look at
the next letter and say the sound it stands for and then the next letter and
sound. Then I blend the sounds together to read and say the word: /g/. . .
/e/. . . /t/. . . _get_ .”


 - Ask students to segment and then blend the word _get_ .


 - Explain that you can make a new word by changing, taking away, or adding a
single letter/sound unit.


 - Erase ‘g’ and write ‘p’ to create _pet_ . As you make this change, say, “If this is
_get_, what is this?” Encourage all students to respond orally.


 - Continue this process as you complete the chains.


~~**DICTATION (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students they are to write the words you say in their dictation journals.
Read the first word, use it in a sentence, and then read the word only once
more, allowing time for students to write. Remind students to refer to their
Individual Code Chart as they write.


 - Use this procedure with each of these words.


_pit_ _tip  bib_


 - After all the words have been called out, tell students you will now show them
the correct spelling for each word, so they can correct their own work.

Observation: Dictation Journal


Look over students’ dictation journals and note the names of students who did not

successfully write each word the first time, as well as the types of errors. These are

very basic sound/spelling correspondences taught in Kindergarten. Observe whether

students who made errors today have similar, generic difficulties on other dictation

Remind students when
two letters are used to
spell one sound, such
as ‘ng’, ‘sh’, ‘ch’, or ‘th’,
it is called a consonant
digraph.


Support students in
distinguishing between the
voiced digraph ‘th’ > /th/
and the unvoiced digraph
‘th’ > /th/. Have students
place a hand on their throat
and say the word _them_ .
Ask them if they feel any
vibration, or buzz, on their
hand. Explain there is a
buzz because the / th/
sound is a voiced sound.
Next, have students repeat
this process, but with the
word _thin_ . Help students
understand there is no buzz
because this ‘th’ sound
is unvoiced. Air passes
through the mouth, but
there is no vibration in the
throat, so it is an unvoiced
sound.

**Rhyming Words**

  - Ask students to identify the first sound and the ending sound of the word _down._


  - Invite students to close their eyes and repeat the word. Isolate the beginning
sound of the word if needed and repeat; say /d/ /ou/ /n/.


  - Tell students to find a rhyming word or rhyming words, we need to change
the first sound and keep the ending sound (e.g., _town_, _noun_ ).


  - Direct students to the alphabet posted in the classroom to use as a reference
for beginning sounds.


  - Invite students to use blends and digraphs they have learned to make
rhymes (e.g., _frown_, _brown_, _clown_, _drown_ ).


  - Repeat this process with the word _cat_ .


**Code Flip Book Review**

  - Turn to **page 7** in the **Consonant Code Flip Book** . Ask students whether this

don’t press your tongue
against the top of your
mouth and push like
you do to make the /ch/

the /sh/ sound.


To make the /th/ sound,
open your teeth just a
little, stick the tip of your
tongue between your
teeth and push the air out.
Notice how this sound
is different because you
have your tongue out,

Code Materials




 - Remind them you can make a new word by changing, taking away, or adding
a single phoneme/grapheme or letter/sound unit.


 - Mention to students that today they will work with chains involving digraphs.
Remind them that while spelled with two letters, a digraph represents only
one sound, so even though a change in digraphs may involve two letters, it
still only involves a single sound.


 - Ask students to segment and then blend the word _lip_ .


 - Erase ‘l’ and write ‘h’ to create _hip_ . As you make this change, say, “If this is _lip_,
what is this?”


 - Be sure to call students’ attention to the digraphs once they appear in the
chain; digraphs may be added at the beginning or end of a word. It may be
helpful to underline a digraph as you write it, for example, _ship_, to emphasize
even though there are two letters being changed, added, or deleted, there is
still only one sound.


 - For each new word, remember to say, “If this is, what is this?”


 - Today, instead of asking all students to respond as a group, select individual
students to respond. Keep the pace moving briskly.


~~**DICTATION (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students they are to write the words you say in their dictation journals.
Read the first word, use it in a sentence, and then read the word only once
more, allowing time for students to write. Remind students to refer to their
Individual Code Chart as they write.


 - Use this procedure with each of these words.


_fed_ _jet_ _pen_


 - After all the words have been called out, tell students you will now show them
the correct spelling for each word, so they can correct their own work.


 - Say and write each word on the board, instructing students to correct their
work by crossing out any incorrect spelling, then copying and writing the
correct spelling next to it. You may wish to consider modeling use of the
Individual Code Chart as you complete this exercise.

Observation: Dictation Journal


Look over students’ dictation journals and note the names of students who did not

successfully write each word the first time, as well as the types of errors made. These

are very basic sound/spelling correspondences taught in Kindergarten. Observe

whether students who made errors today have similar, generic difficulties on other

dictation exercises during the remaining Back-to-School lessons—an indication that

the Grade 2 materials may not be a good instructional fit for these students—or

whether there are only a few isolated sound/spelling errors.

successfully write each word the first time, as well as the types of errors made. These

are very basic sound/spelling correspondences taught in Kindergarten. Observe

whether students who made errors today have similar, generic difficulties on other

dictation exercises completed during the previous Back-to-School lessons—an

indication that the Grade 2 materials may not be a good instructional fit for these

students—or whether there are only a few isolated sound/spelling errors.

  - Point to and read the title of the story, reminding students the title provides
an idea of what the story is about.


**Preview Core Vocabulary**

  - Preview the following vocabulary words with students by calling attention
to each bolded word on Activity Page 5.1 and explaining the meaning. Allow
students to ask questions to clarify the meaning of the words, as necessary.


**scraped—v.,** removed from a surface by rubbing with something sharp
or rough

Example: She scraped the gum off her shoe with a stick.


**site—n.,** a place where something happens or where something will be built

Example: This looks like a good site to build a house.


**plaster—n.,** a paste made of sand, lime, and water that becomes hard when it
dries

Example: The doctor used plaster to harden the fabric cast on my
broken arm.


**crane—n.,** a machine with a tall arm that can move up and down or around in
a circle to lift and move heavy objects

Example: The construction workers used a crane to move the large
wooden beams.


**lab—n.,** a place where a scientist or doctor works; short for _laboratory_

Example: The scientist looked at the bone samples in his lab.


**TEKS 2.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text; **TEKS 2.6.A** Establish
purpose for reading assigned and self-selected texts; **TEKS 2.6.G** Evaluate details read to determine key ideas.

###### Assessment Overview

~~**IMPORTANCE OF ASSESSMENTS**~~


The focus of Lessons 6–10 is to gauge students’ reading knowledge through
the Story Reading and Word Reading Assessments. Taking this time to assess
students is crucial to ensure their success as readers. The assessments
will help you determine which students have the knowledge and skills they
need to profit from Grade 2 Skills instruction and which students need
to be regrouped to an earlier point in the Skills program. Warm-Ups are
omitted this week in order to maximize the amount of time needed to assess
students. Additional Support activities are also not included in this week’s
lessons. Details about interpretation of students’ scores for placement are
provided in the Placement Overview section, located after Lesson 10 of this
Teacher Guide.


~~**INDEPENDENT WORK**~~


Activity pages are provided for students to complete independently while
others are being assessed. They have been designed for students to work on
without direct teacher guidance. You may also incorporate any independent
activities that are routine in your classroom, such as looking at trade books,
working at a listening station, or writing in journals.


It is important for students to be engaged in activities that allow you to
maintain a calm atmosphere conducive to assessment. Decide on the
procedure you will implement for preparing students to work independently
so things run smoothly during this time.


Lesson 6 Assessment Overview
**75**


**76**



~~**K–1 EXPERIENCE**~~


To accurately place students in reading groups, it is helpful to have a basic
overview of the program from Grades K–1. The following chart provides a
broad overview of what is taught in Grades K and 1. Students who did well in
Grade 1 should be ready for the Grade 2 sequence. In general, students who
mastered Grade 1 material from:


 - Units 1–6 should have adequate preparation for the Grade 2 sequence.


 - Unit 7 should have good to outstanding preparation.


~~**SCORING AND PLACEMENT**~~


After each assessment, there is information in the Scoring section about
evaluating students’ scores. The Scoring section also tells you which
students will take the next Story Reading and Word Reading Assessments.
After Lesson 10, information is provided guiding the placement of students in
appropriate reading groups in the Placement Overview section.


**If the placement tests indicate a student is not ready for Grade 2, it is**
**imperative the student be regrouped to get Skills instruction matching**
**his or her reading ability.** There is an appropriate placement in the K–1–2
materials for every reader (and for nonreaders, as well), but the beginning
of Grade 2 is not the best place for students with limited code knowledge
and reading ability or for students who rely on picture clues, whole word
recollection, and guessing instead of reading by blending.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


The primary purpose of this week will be to assess all students to determine
placement and instruction in the appropriate level of materials. Starting
today, students will read a story silently and then answer comprehension
questions. The stories and questions are located in students’ Activity Books.
Depending on the student, each assessment can take from 20 to 30 minutes
to complete. Additional activity pages are provided that can be completed
independently each day after students have finished their assessment.


Students will turn in their completed Story Reading Assessment to you.
They should be scored as soon as possible to determine which students
will continue with the next assessment. You will follow the same procedure
each day this week (i.e., students who successfully complete the daily Story
Reading Assessment will continue to read a new story and questions the
next day).


If/when students do not successfully complete a Story Reading Assessment,
you will give those students an individually administered Word Reading
Assessment in order to more accurately determine individual reading
strengths and weaknesses for placement consideration. You will begin
administering the Word Reading Assessment to any students who do not
successfully complete the Story Reading Assessment, “Snacks,” today.


As noted above, throughout all lessons this week, activity pages are provided
that students should be able to complete independently to ensure adequate
time to assess students individually.


Feel free to provide additional or alternate independent activities for
students, including looking at trade books, writing in journals, or other
activities that can be completed with little or no teacher assistance.


**Reading**

  - Decide what students will work on if they complete the assessment and the
compound word activity while other students are still testing. Prepare any
trade books, listening centers, or writing journals you choose for students
to use.


  - Make one copy of the Placement Planning Sheet found in Teacher Resources.

**Universal Access**

 - Nonreaders will struggle with both today’s assessment and independent
work. Consider preparing several listening centers as well as a story drawing
center for students who will finish very early.

**Primary Focus:** Students will read “Snacks,” a short story comprised of onesyllable words with basic spellings, and will answer eight written multiple-choice
questions about key details in the text. ~~**TEKS 2.6.G**~~


~~**STORY READING ASSESSMENT (20–30 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** The Story Reading Assessment tests students’ ability to read
connected prose and answer simple multiple-choice questions. Each
assessment consists of a story and eight multiple-choice questions. The
questions are meant to be relatively easy. “Snacks” is 51 words long. It uses
only one-syllable words and only a few of the most basic spellings, all of
which are taught in Kindergarten.


**Administration**

  - Have all students tear out “Snacks” on Activity Page 6.1 and the story
comprehension page on Activity Page 6.2.


  - Have students read the story to themselves and answer the multiple-choice
questions on the accompanying page. Tell them they can and should look
back at the story and use it to help them answer the questions.


  - This is not a timed assessment (the times provided in the Lesson at a
Glance chart are estimates). Allow enough time for students to answer
the questions.


**Scoring “Snacks”**


Score the “Snacks” assessment during this class period as soon as students
complete the assessment.


  - Use the following answer key to score “Snacks.”

**Lesson 7: Word Reading Assessment**

TIME
VARIES
Foundational Skills


**Primary Focus:** Students will read words with consonant clusters, consonant
digraphs, short vowels, vowel digraphs, diphthongs, r-controlled vowels, spelling
alternatives, and Tricky Words. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.i; TEKS 2.2.B.iii**~~


~~**WORD READING ASSESSMENT**~~


**Administration**

  - You will begin the Word Reading Assessment with students who scored
fewer than five correct on “Snacks.” This assessment will provide further
information about where to place students. It will also help you pinpoint
specific letter-sound correspondences the student does not know.


  - **This is a single-word reading assessment that needs to be administered**
**individually.** It consists of 120 words that contain particular spellings.
The words have been sequenced to reflect the order of instruction in the
program: the first fifteen words are CVC words students read in Units 3–5
of Kindergarten; the next fifteen words contain consonant clusters and are
similar to the words taught in Unit 6 of Kindergarten, and so on.


  - Assess one student at a time, asking him or her to bring the Word Reading
Assessment Recording Sheet (Activity Page 7.1) to the assessment area. You will
use this sheet to record the student’s answers while the student reads the words
on the Word Reading Assessment Word List found in Teacher Resources.


  - You may place a marker under each row of words in order to eliminate
student confusion when reading.


  - Ask the student to read the words aloud to you.


  - Place an ‘X’ on the record sheet next to any word the student gets wrong or
fails to read. If you have time, write the word the student says instead so you
can further analyze errors.


  - Do not coach or correct the student.


  - Have the student move to the next word if he/she cannot read it quickly. If
the student fails to read six words in a row and becomes frustrated, you may
discontinue the assessment. Exception: If the student misses a series of six
Tricky Words in lines 9–12, jump to line 13 to see if the student can read more
advanced decodable words.


**TEKS 2.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (i) decoding words with short, long, or variant vowels, trigraphs
and blends; (iii) decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including
digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables.

Lesson 10 Placement Assessment: Word Reading Assessment
**105**


###### Placement Overview

~~**MOVING FORWARD WITH UNIT 1 LESSONS**~~


It will likely take some time for you to fully score, record, and analyze assessment data for all students.
Unit 1 is deliberately planned as a review of Grade 1 skills with no new Grade 2 skills introduced.


Guidance is provided here for a thorough analysis of the assessment data; **you should complete this**
**analysis for each student well before the end of Unit 1 instruction.** This analysis will inform decisions
as to whether students are ready to continue with Grade 2, Unit 2 instruction or whether other instruction
is needed to ensure mastery of skills taught at the Grade 1 level. Students may lack these skills for a
variety of reasons, including being new to the program, perhaps having used different approaches and/or
instructional materials in previous grades, difficulty in thoroughly mastering these skills in spite of having
participated in instruction in the program, and so on. Whatever the reason, it is important to identify code
knowledge gaps now and address them rather than simply push students ahead through the Grade 2
materials.


~~**MULTI-LEVEL ANALYSIS OF ASSESSMENTS**~~


You will want to conduct an analysis of each student’s performance on the various assessments
using different “filters” or “lenses.” First look at each student’s overall performance on these
assessments for guidance as to whether a given student has the prerequisite skills needed to
profit from Grade 2 instruction with standard pacing. As noted above, Unit 1 of Grade 2 provides
a review of all of the short vowel letter-sound correspondences as well the various consonant
letter-sound correspondences taught in Grade 1. All students, including those who performed
well, will benefit from this review. However, the review is fast-paced. Students with low overall
scores and performance on the assessments may need even more instruction of skills taught in
Grade 1; recommendations in the Placement and Grouping Guidelines section will address how to
accomplish this.


~~**INTERPRETING STUDENT SCORES FOR PLACEMENT**~~


Once you have administered and scored all assessments, enter students’ scores on the Placement
Planning Sheet located in Teacher Resources. Consideration of these scores is critical in
determining what Skills instruction students need and how to group students to facilitate the best
delivery of this instruction. Use the **Interpreting Assessment Scores** chart that follows to make
a first attempt to assign students in your class to a particular group. You may find, however, that
you have students whose scores do not fall neatly into one of the categories on this chart. In these
cases, you will need to take a much closer look at each student’s performance on the assessments,
using the specific analysis charts for **Word Reading Analysis** and **Story Reading Analysis** .


Foundational Skills 1
**106**


~~**INTERPRETING ASSESSMENT SCORES**~~


**Note:** The scores on this page should not be confused with the scores provided for the
administration of assessments in the Assessment Overview. Each of the scores in this chart
represents a degree of mastery on the combined assessments administered. Students scoring in
the upper range of words correct may be ready for instruction in the more advanced grouping
(e.g., Group 1 instead of 2 or Group 2 instead of 3).

Placement Overview

~~**TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT ASSESSMENT PERFORMANCE**~~


**Word Reading Assessment Scores**


The more words a student is able to read and the farther the student is able to progress in the
assessment are indicators of preparation for Grade 2.


There are a total of 120 words included in Lines 1–24 of the Word Reading Assessment. As a general
rule of thumb, students who show good performance on the first seventeen lines of the assessment
(i.e., 85 words) have **adequate preparation** for Grade 2. Students who struggle with many of the
words on these early lines may need to be regrouped to an earlier point in the grade-level materials.


Lines 9–12 consist of twenty Tricky Words taught in prior grades. Tricky Words are words that
contain a sound/spelling that doesn’t follow the basic code or is unusual enough to have not yet
been taught. Students who struggle with these words will need targeted remediation on any words
read incorrectly.


Students who are also able to read words on lines 18–24, an additional thirty-five words, may have
**strong or outstanding preparation** for Grade 2; these words include many sound/spellings that
were not taught in Grade 1, but will be introduced over the course of the year in Grade 2. They may
also be ready to read trade books independently.


**The Word Reading Assessment lines consist of the following:**


     - Lines 1–3: CVC words with short vowel spellings.


     - Lines 4–6: words made up of short vowel spellings containing common consonant clusters


     - Lines 7–8: words made up of short vowel spellings containing common consonant digraphs


     - Lines 9–12: Tricky Words


     - Lines 13–15: words with vowel digraphs, diphthongs, and r-controlled vowels


     - Lines 16–17: words with spelling alternatives for consonant sounds


     - Lines 18–20: words with common vowel spelling alternatives for long vowel sounds


     - Lines 21–22: words that include / ə /


     - Lines 23–24: words with more spelling alternatives for vowel sounds


**Story Reading Assessment Scores**


Students who answered 4 or fewer questions correctly on “Snacks” have **inadequate preparation**
for the Grade 2 sequence of Skills instruction. These students likely have fairly significant skills
deficits and will need to be regrouped to an earlier point of instruction in the grade-level materials.
Additional information from the Word Reading Assessment should be used to guide placement.


Foundational Skills 1
**108**


Students who can answer five or more of the questions on “Snacks” and “Prince Vincent” likely have
**adequate preparation** for the Grade 2 sequence. Students who cannot do this need remediation
and/or to be regrouped to an earlier point in the grade-level materials. Additional information from
the Word Reading Assessment should be used to guide placement.


Students who can answer five or more of the questions on “The Beach” likely have **strong**
**preparation** for Grade 2 and may be ready to read trade books.


Students who can answer five or more of the questions on “Sink or Float” have **outstanding**

**preparation** for Grade 2 and are almost certainly ready to read trade books independently. If there

are enough students performing at this level, they may be grouped together for Skills so they can

move at a faster pace.


**Note:** Grade 1 teachers were asked to pass forward a summary of results for each student to Grade
2 teachers. A strong performance on the end-of-year Grade 1 assessment is an indication that the
student should be ready for Grade 2 instruction, even if his or her performance on this placement
assessment is now slightly below his performance at the end of the Grade 1 school year. Some
learning loss is expected during the summer months if students have not been encouraged to
continue reading.


**Analyzing Borderline Scores**


Students with borderline scores are the most challenging to place. In particular, you may have
some students who are right on the border between being strong enough readers to benefit from
the Grade 2 instruction and not having adequate preparation. These might include students who
read the first story on the Story Reading Assessment and answered most of the questions correctly
but struggled with the second story, or they might include students whose performance was
inconsistent on lines 9–17 of the Word Reading Assessment.


It is strongly recommended that you take a closer look at these students’ assessment performance
using the **Word Reading Analysis and Story Reading Analysis Charts** that follow, keeping the
following points in mind:


  - In assessing the **Word Reading Assessment**, remember not all poor scores are the same. Five
correct out of 15 on a section of this assessment probably indicates a major problem reading the
words or spellings in question. Ten correct out of 15, however, might result from the student not
knowing a small set of letter-sound correspondences. This sort of problem can often be remediated
in supplemental small group sessions, and may not require placing the student at an earlier point in
the sequence of instruction.


  - In assessing the **Story Reading Assessment**, be aware that some students may have little previous
experience with multiple-choice assessments. They may struggle to answer the questions even if
they read the story and understood it. You may wish to have borderline students read the story aloud
to you and then discuss it with you.


Placement Overview
**109**


     - Remember one possibility is to place the student back at an earlier point in the grade-level materials,
but a second possibility is to place them in the Grade 2 material and then provide remediation to
correct specific problems. For example, if you can identify the specific letter-sound correspondences
causing difficulty, or the specific Tricky Words he or she has not learned, you may be able to provide
extra practice sessions while the student participates in Grade 2 instruction.


     - If you are considering grouping less-prepared students with stronger students and teaching both
groups the Grade 2 sequence, be sure to individualize instruction during small group time to meet all
students’ needs.


     - If you feel you will be unable to provide such additional support sessions, this may be a reason to
regroup less-prepared students to an earlier point in the grade-level materials.

~~**PLACEMENT AND GROUPING GUIDELINES**~~


**It is highly recommended that all Grade 2 teachers meet as a grade-level team to examine**
**students’ scores across the entire grade level, rather than having each teacher examine**
**only the scores of students in his or her own classroom. Homogeneous grouping for Skills**
**instruction is the most efficient and effective way to differentiate instruction and meet**
**students’ needs when teaching phonics skills.** Once the grade-level team has examined the
scores of all students on these assessments, you may find that it makes sense to regroup some
students presently in different classrooms on the basis of their specific decoding skills for purposes
of Skills instruction only.


The student scores you have been recording for both assessments will be useful in deciding where
students should be placed for Skills instruction. Once students have been placed and grouped,
these scores can be shared with other teachers who may be working with students for Skills.


(Skills instruction also includes spelling, grammar, and writing. However, decisions about placement
in the materials are based on evaluating students’ reading (decoding) and basic comprehension
skills.)


Grade 2 teachers should meet as a team after they have completed the Placement Planning Chart
(having assigned a group number to each student in their class). Teachers may wish to write each
student’s name and group number on an index card for ease in grouping students. Using the group
numbers, begin sorting students from all classrooms on the basis of their group number, using
the following guidelines. These guidelines are intended to provide general grouping guidance.
However, teachers may need to deviate from this guidance to ensure that no single teacher has
a larger number of students; this is especially important in instances in which a large number of
students have been identified in Group 3 and/or as having questionable or inadequate skills.

~~**PLACEMENT FOR KNOWLEDGE**~~





**The Skills placement assessments do not provide a basis for regrouping students during**
**the Knowledge period. In fact, all students should participate in the Knowledge sessions**
**on grade level, regardless of their decoding skills.** Limited decoding skills will not prevent the
student from learning from the Read-Alouds, discussions, and activities in Knowledge. In fact,
the focus on oral language in the Knowledge periods may provide struggling decoders with an
opportunity to shine.

**Foundational Skills**

  - Write the following Tricky Words on yellow index cards, one per card: _the_,
_he_, _she_, _we_, _be_, _me_ . If space allows, allocate wall space somewhere in your
classroom to start a Tricky Word Wall where you will display these Tricky
Word cards.


  - Prepare to display the Consonant Code Flip Book within view of all students;
also have the Spelling Cards listed in the Lesson at a Glance chart, student
Individual Code Charts, and red markers readily available.


**Reading**

  - At the start of the week, study the completed Anecdotal Reading Record
and make a copy of the blank Anecdotal Reading Record provided in Teacher
Resources. Over the course of the week, be sure to listen to each student
read at least once and note student performance in the Anecdotal
Reading Record.


  - Plan to assign student pairs for partner reading.


**Writing**

  - Prepare an enlarged version of Digital Component 11.1 to display for students
during cursive writing instruction.


**Universal Access**

  - Prepare word cards to use in an optional pantomime support activity with the
words _sprang, munch, drift_ .

Foundational Skills


**Primary Focus**
Students will read and pronounce the Tricky Words _the_, _he_, _she_, _we_, _be_, _me_ .


~~**TEKS 2.2.A.i; TEKS 2.2.B.vii**~~


Students will review the double consonant sound/spellings /b/ > ‘bb’, /k/ > ‘cc’,
/k/ > ‘ck’, /g/ > ‘gg’, /f/ > ‘ff’, and /l/ > ‘ll’. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.i**~~


~~**TRICKY WORDS : THE, HE, SHE, WE, BE, ME**~~ ~~**(10 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.vii**~~


**Tricky Word Review**

  - Remind students that most English words play by the rules, meaning they
are pronounced and spelled as we would expect. There are a few words that
do not play by the rules, including some very common and important ones.
Words that do not play by the rules (i.e., words not pronounced and spelled
as expected) are called “Tricky Words.”


**Note:** The following Tricky Words may be familiar to students as they were
taught in Kindergarten and Grade 1 as Tricky Words. Furthermore, students
who finished Unit 6 for Grade 1 may already know ‘e’ as a spelling alternative
for /ee/.


**Tricky Word: The**

  - Using the Tricky Word cards you prepared in advance, hold up the card for
_the_, read the word, and use it aloud in a sentence. Remind students that the
yellow color of the car signals that students should proceed with caution
when reading a word because one or more parts are tricky.


  - Discuss which part of the word is read just as one would expect and which
part is tricky.


    - **Expected:** the letters ‘th’ are pronounced /th/. **Tricky:** the letter ‘e’ is
pronounced as a / ə / or as /ee/.


**TEKS 2.2.A.i** Demonstrate phonological awareness by producing a series of rhyming words; **TEKS 2.2.B** Demonstrate and
apply phonetic knowledge by (vii) identifying and reading high-frequency words from a research-based list; (i) decoding words
with short, long, and variant vowels, trigraphs, and blends.


Foundational Skills 1


**Tricky Word: He**

 - Hold up the card for _he_, read the word, and use it aloud in a sentence.


 - Discuss which part of the word _he_ is read just as one would expect and which
part is tricky.


   - **Expected:** the letter ‘h’ is pronounced /h/. **Tricky:** the letter ‘e’ is
pronounced /ee/ instead of /e/.


**Tricky Words: She, We, Be, Me**

 - Point out that the remaining Tricky Words rhyme with _the_ and _he_ .


 - Repeat these steps for the Tricky Words _she_, _we_, _be_, and _me_, explaining
that the first spelling in each word is read just as one would expect and the
second spelling is tricky in the same way in all of the words.


   - **Tricky:** the letter ‘e’ is pronounced /ee/ rather than /e/.


 - After going over the Tricky Words, complete a quick flash card review. You do not
need to discuss which parts are tricky; simply ask students to read the word.


 - If space allows, place the words on the area of the wall that you have chosen
to designate as the Tricky Word Wall so they are readily available for students
to reference. It is recommended that you sequence the cards in alphabetical
order. As new words are added in subsequent lessons and units, you will need
to rearrange the cards to maintain the alphabetical listing.


~~**REVIEW DOUBLE-LETTER SPELLINGS (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students they will review spellings that involve two of the same letters
sitting side by side to stand for one consonant sound.


 - Remind students the consonant sounds will always be written in red on the
Spelling Cards.


 - Today’s letter-sound correspondences can be found on these pages of the
Consonant Code Flip Book.

- Using the same procedure as in earlier lessons, review the letter-sound
correspondences listed in the box on the previous page. Prior to introducing
a new spelling for a sound, be sure to point out any previously taught
spellings. For example, before teaching the spelling ‘bb’ for /b/, remind
students they have already learned /b/ is spelled most frequently as ‘b’.


- Distribute the red markers.


- Ask students to outline the cards and the letter spellings in their Individual
Code Charts; today’s letter-sound correspondences can be found on these
pages of the Individual Code Chart.

If students struggle in
sounding out _bandit_, cover
the second syllable with
finger ( _dit_ ), asking them to
read just the first syllable
( _ban_ ). Then cover the
first syllable ( _ban_ ), asking
them to read the second
syllable ( _dit_ ). Reveal the
entire word, asking them
to blend and read both
syllables. See Appendix C
for more help.

  - Also remember to discuss the power bar for each spelling.


  - Point out the double-letter spellings are generally used at the end of words
and in the middle of longer words, but are rarely found at the beginning
of words.


**Lesson 11: “The Hot Dog”**

20M
Reading


**Primary Focus:** Students will read “The Hot Dog” aloud with purpose and
understanding;, will practice reading with accuracy, appropriate rate, and
expression; and will answer oral literal and inferential questions about key details
in the text. ~~**TEKS 2.4; TEKS 2.6.C; TEKS 2.6.G**~~


~~**INTRODUCE THE READER AND STORY (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Explain that today students will read in their new Reader, _The Cat Bandit_ .


  - Discuss the title of the Reader. Write the word _bandit_ on the board. Ask
students to read the word _bandit_ by sounding out each syllable, blending
them together, and reading the word aloud.


**TEKS 2.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text; **TEKS 2.6.C** Make and correct
or confirm predictions using text features, characteristics of genre, and structures; **TEKS 2.6.G** Evaluate details read to

Foundational Skills 1


  - Tell students bandits are people who take things that do not belong to them.
A synonym for _bandit_ is _robber_ .


  - Have students turn to the table of contents. Explain the purpose of a table
of contents.


    - The table of contents tells the reader the names of each chapter and the
page on which each chapter begins.


  - Looking at the table of contents, ask students the title of the first story in the
Reader. Then ask students on which page “The Hot Dog” begins, telling them
they will read this story today. _(page 2)_


  - Remind students that stories are made up of sentences, and sentences end
with some type of punctuation.


  - Tell students in “The Hot Dog,” there are sentences ending in periods and
there are sentences ending in exclamation points. Write an exclamation
point on the board and review this punctuation, which indicates the sentence
should be read with excitement.


  - Write the sentence _Get up_ . on the board and read it aloud. Then switch the
period to an exclamation point. Read “Get up!” with excitement, modeling for
students how the exclamation point changes the tone of a sentence.


**Preview Core Vocabulary**

  - Preview the following core vocabulary words with students by either writing
each word on the board or calling students’ attention to the word on the page
where it is used in the Reader. Orally discuss the definition. Note that the

Writing


**Primary Focus:** Students will develop handwriting by accurately forming all

cursive letters using appropriate strokes when connecting letters. ~~**TEKS 2.2.E**~~


**CURSIVE: THE COUNTER-CLOCK LETTERS:**
~~**LOWERCASE ‘A’, ‘C’, D’, ‘G’, ‘O’, AND ‘Q’ (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students they will start learning the cursive alphabet with the lowercase

letters, beginning with the letters ‘a’, ‘c’, ‘d’, ‘g’, ‘o’, and ‘q’. Print each of the

letters on the board, and then slowly write each letter in cursive underneath

its printed counterpart.


    - If possible, project Digital Component 11.1 to model writing the letters.


  - Ask students what the shape of the cursive letters have in common.


    - They all have a round shape; each includes a circle or part of a circle.


  - Tell students that because of the roundness of these letters and the way they

are formed, (by moving a pencil in the opposite direction of the movement of

a clock’s hands), they are called the Counter-Clock Letters.


  - Write the letters on the board again, emphasizing the circular shape that is

part of each.


  - Direct students to Activity Page 11.1. Point out that some of the letters on the

page are written with dotted lines rather than solid lines. Tell them that the

dotted letters are for tracing and the solid letters are for copying.


  - If possible, project a page of the activity book, and model tracing, copying,

and forming letters.


  - Stand facing away from the class, and model writing each letter in the air.

Have students do the same.


**TEKS 2.2.E** Develop handwriting by accurately forming all cursive letters using appropriate strokes when connecting letters.


Foundational Skills 1


  - Model writing the Counter-Clock Letters, one at a time, on the board or using

a projector that permits students to observe your hand movements. After

modeling each letter, have students trace it on Activity Page 11.1.


  - Have students complete the activity page. As they work, circulate and offer

assistance as needed.

~~**TEKS 2.2.C.iv**~~




- Explain that starting this week, students will have a list of spelling words to
practice and learn.


- Tell students the spelling words only use spellings they know, so they can
segment and blend each word.


- Explain there is also one Tricky Word each week. Remind students that Tricky
Words are words that do not follow the rules, so their spellings must be
memorized.


- Have students turn to Activity Page 11.2. Explain that this is a list of the
spelling words they will practice for the week.


- Read and write each spelling word and have students repeat the word
after you.


- Ask students to use each word in a sentence, making sure to explain the
meaning of any words they do not know.

 - Refer to the words on the Tricky Word Wall or write the Tricky Words _the_, _he_,
_she_, _we_, _be_, _me_ on the **board/chart paper** and ask students how they would
pronounce each word. (The most logical pronunciation, at this point, would
be the code that has been taught.) For example, the expected pronunciation
for _was_ is /w/ /a/ /s/.


 - Review why each word is tricky. For example, the word _was_ has a decodable
initial sound spelling: ‘w’ is pronounced /w/. However, the rest of the word is
tricky because ‘as’ is pronounced /u/ /z/.


 - Tell students that when reading a Tricky Word (or tricky part of a word), they
simply have to remember the word and how to pronounce it. The letters don’t
follow the usual sound/spelling correspondence patterns that have
been taught.


 - Use each Tricky Word aloud in a sentence. Call on students to come up
and point to the correct Tricky Word when they hear it in the sentence you
say aloud.


~~**MORE HELP WITH RHYMING WORDS**~~


 - Reinforce students’ understanding of how to produce a series of rhyming
words by creating a class poem.


 - Have students choose a topic, and then write the first line yourself. Be sure to
end the line with a word that has many rhyming possibilities (e.g., _man_ )


 - Guide students to provide subsequent lines for the poem that end in rhymes.


~~**MORE HELP WITH THIS WEEK’S SPELLING WORDS**~~

   - **Good to Go Cards** **(Activity Page TR 11.3)**


   - **Problem Cards** **(Activity Page TR 11.4)**


 - Provide some **small tokens** as playing pieces.


 - Students take turns drawing word cards. If a student reads the word
correctly, then he or she can draw a Good to Go card and follow the

directions on the card. If a student does not read the word correctly, then he/
she will draw a card from the Problem pile and follow the directions on
that card.

**Reading**

 - Today you will listen to students read “The Chicken Nugget” as a class.
Decide in advance how you will select students to read the story. Refer to
your sequenced list of students to listen to them read aloud each day so
you have opportunity to observe their oral reading. Do not, however, read
the story as a choral read. You want to use this opportunity to hear students
decode words on their own. In the next lesson, students will read “The
Chicken Nugget” in small groups. Students needing more support will read
the story with you in one group, while more independent students will partner
read on their own. As always, you will want to pay close attention to students
reading today in order to divide students into two groups in the next lesson.


) **Digital Component 12.2**


 - Create a blank version of the Cat Bandit chart in Introduce the Story (Digital
Component 12.2) or prepare to display the digital version to document
story events and the cat bandit’s clever ways. This will serve as a visual
reminder of the cat bandit’s adventures. In addition, _The_ _Cat Bandit_
Reader also has onomatopoeia in each story that you will identify with
students. Onomatopoeia are words that name a sound by trying to mimic
the actual sound. For example, in the sentence _The cow moos and the pig_
_oinks._, _moo_ and _oink_ sound like the actual animal sounds and are therefore
onomatopoeia words. See Teacher Resources for a completed Sample Cat
Bandit Chart.

**Primary Focus**
Students will read and pronounce the Tricky Words _was_, _of_, and _a_ . ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.vii**~~


Students will blend one- and two-syllable words with double consonant lettersound correspondences /m/ > ‘mm’, /n/ > ‘nn’ >, /p/ > ‘pp’, /r/ > ‘rr’, /s/ > ‘ss’,
/t/ > ‘tt’, and /z/ > ‘zz’. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.v**~~


~~**TRICKY WORDS: WAS, OF, A (10 MIN.)**~~


**Tricky Word: Was**

  - Using the Tricky Word cards you prepared in advance, hold up the card for
_was_, read the word, and use it aloud in a sentence.


  - Discuss which parts of the word are read just as one would expect and which
parts are tricky.


    - **Expected:** the letter ‘w’ is pronounced /w/ and the letter ‘s’ is pronounced
/z/. **Tricky:** the letter ‘a’ is pronounced /u/.


**Tricky Word: Of**

  - Hold up the card for _of_, read the word, and use it aloud in a sentence.


  - Discuss how the word is tricky.


    - **Tricky:** the letter ‘o’ is pronounced /u/ and the letter ‘f’ is pronounced /v/.


**Tricky Word: A**

  - Hold up the card for _a_ and ask students to read the word and use it aloud in
a sentence.


  - Discuss how the word is tricky.


    - **Tricky:** the letter ‘a’ is pronounced like /u/.


**TEKS 2.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (vii) identifying and reading high-frequency words from a
research-based list; (v) decoding words using knowledge of syllable division patterns such as VCCV, VCV, and VCCCV.


Foundational Skills 1


 - After going over the Tricky Words, add them to the Tricky Word Wall and do a
quick review, pointing to different cards on the wall; include the cards from
the previous lesson. You do not need to discuss which parts are tricky; simply
ask students to read the word.


~~**REVIEW DOUBLE-LETTER SPELLINGS (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students they will review spellings that involve two of the same letters
sitting side by side to stand for one consonant sound.


 - Today’s letter-sound correspondences can be found on these pages of the
Consonant Code Flip Book.

Literacy Skills


Accurate pronunciation
aids correct soundspelling. Listen carefully to
students’ articulation of the
double consonants in _dress_
and _buzz_ . Mispronunciation
of ‘ss’ > /s/ and ‘zz’ > /z/
may occur due to identical
mouth position when
saying these sounds. The
mouth is partially open
with lips pulled back at
the corners and teeth
barely touching. Encourage
students to touch their
throat to feel the vibration
of the voiced ‘zz’ > /z/ in
the vocal chords. Have
students say _dress_ and
realize there is no vibration,
as ‘ss’ > /s/ is unvoiced.

6. ‘nn’ > /n/ ( _running_ ) **page 16**


7. ‘rr’ > /r/ ( _ferret_ ) **page 18**




- Using the same procedure as in earlier lessons, review the letter-sound
correspondences listed in the previous box. Prior to introducing a new
spelling for a sound, be sure to point out any previously taught spellings. For
example, before teaching the spelling ‘pp’ for /p/, remind students they have
already learned /p/ is spelled most frequently as ‘p’.


- Distribute the red markers.


- Remind students that consonant sounds will always be written in red on the
Spelling Cards.


- Ask students to outline the cards and the letter spellings in their Individual
Code Charts; today’s letter-sound correspondences can be found on these
pages of the Individual Code Chart.

at the end of an interrogative sentence. ~~**TEKS 2.11.D; TEKS 2.11.D.x**~~


~~**SENTENCE CAPITALIZATION AND PUNCTUATION (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that in the previous lesson they read “The Hot Dog” and
paid careful attention to a certain punctuation mark. Ask students if they
remember the type of punctuation mark and what it tells the reader to do.
( _exclamation point; read with excitement_ )


  - Tell students that there is a special punctuation mark that we put at the end
of sentences that ask questions. Ask students if they know the name of this
type of ending punctuation mark. ( _question mark_ )


  - Also review with students beginning capitalization; remind students that the
first letter of the first word in a sentence is capitalized.


  - Referring to the sentences you prepared in advance, read the sentence
aloud as a class. Ask a student to come to the board to write the correct
capitalization and ending punctuation. Discuss the reason for the changes.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


It is critical that you review Appendix C, Using Chunking to Decode
Multisyllable Words, focusing on how to scaffold students in chunking
two-syllable words made up of two closed syllables, prior to this lesson.
Practice using your hand and fingers to reveal each syllable, as illustrated in
Appendix C.


Today is the first time this year for small group work. Small group work is a
time for you to provide more individual attention and feedback to students,
perhaps listening to them read aloud or reteaching/reinforcing certain skills.
Work with two groups: Group 2 consists of more independent workers and
Group 1 consists of students needing more support and close monitoring.
Information from beginning assessments, anecdotal notes, and other
classroom observations should guide your decision on how to divide your
class into these groups (you may further divide your class if necessary).
Groups are meant to be fluid, meaning that a student in Group 1 for one week
might be in Group 2 for the next week.

for students to blend.
Then reveal both syllables,
so students can blend
both syllables together.

- Remind students that words can be broken into chunks called syllables. A
syllable has one, and only one, vowel sound. This means a word has as many
syllables as it has vowel sounds. For example, a word with one vowel sound
has one syllable, and a word with two vowel sounds has two syllables.


- Tell students today they will read two-syllable words (i.e., words with two
vowel sounds).


- Students should read the words by blending the sounds in the first syllable,
then blending the sounds in the second syllable, and then putting the two
syllables together. Model this for students by pointing to the word _basket_ on
the chart you prepared in advance.


- Ask students to sound out the word by first blending the sounds in the first
syllable (/b/ /a/ /s/: _bas_ ), then blending the sounds in the second syllable
(/k/ /e/ /t/: _ket_ ), and then putting the two syllables together ( _basket_ ).


- Tell students that the syllables in _basket_ are both closed syllables. Closed
syllables end with consonants, in this case s and t. Students can use the
consonants to know where one syllable ends and another begins.


- Repeat this process with words in the following box except for _invent_
and _contest_ .

~~**PRACTICE SUFFIX SPELLING PATTERNS (15 MIN.)**~~


) **Digital Component 13.2**


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 13.1 while you display the digital version.


 - Tell students this activity focuses on suffixes. Tell students a suffix is a group
of letters added to the end of a root word. Today, students will work with the
suffix – _ing_ ; this suffix shows an action is taking place.


 - Explain that sometimes when the suffix – _ing_ is added, the root word will
change and follow a common spelling pattern for many consonant sounds.


 - Explain that one-syllable words with a short vowel sound and a single
consonant ending change to a double-letter spelling at the end when the
suffix (ending) – _ing_ is added.


 - Complete the first three examples of Activity Page 13.1 together as a class.


   - Read the first word in the column, _rub_, carefully explaining the shift
in spelling.


   - “Look at the word _rub_ . How many syllables is it?” (Remind students onesyllable words have one vowel sound.)


   - “ _Rub_ has one syllable. Let’s look to see if it has a short vowel in it. Yes, the
‘u’ in _rub_ is a short vowel. Does _rub_ end in a single consonant? Yes, ‘b’ is a
single consonant.


   - “Because _rub_ is a one-syllable word that has a short vowel sound and ends
in a single consonant, we add an extra ‘b’ before adding the – _ing_ to _rub_ .
_Rub_ turns to _rubbing_ .”


   - Write _rubbing_ in the next column. Circle the root word _rub_, and underline
the suffix – _ing_ .

 - Follow the bullet points step by step to draw the following chart to illustrate
the tricky spelling ‘g’.












- On the left side of the board or chart paper, begin by writing /g/ and below it
the words _got_, _gum_, and _big_ . Read the words aloud.


- Point out the spelling ‘g’ is pronounced /g/ in these words.


- Explain that ‘g’ is a “tricky spelling” because it can also be pronounced as /j/.


- Write /j/ on the right side of the board. Explain that ‘g’ is often pronounced
/j/ when it is followed by the letter ‘e’ or the letter ‘i’.


- Below /j/, write the words _gem_, _tragic_, and _legend_ . Read the words aloud and
point out the spelling ‘g’ is pronounced /j/ in these words.


- Write the letter ‘g’ on the board between the two sets of words and circle
the spelling.


- Tell students that in order to figure out how to pronounce this tricky spelling
when it occurs in a word, they may need to try sounding it out two
different ways.


- Draw one arrow from ‘g’ to the /g/ words and label it ‘1’. Draw a second arrow

may have difficulty
pronouncing the /j/
sound. Explain that in
English, the letters ‘j’ and
‘g’ can stand for the /j/
sound. To make the sound,
put the tip of your tongue
against the top of your
mouth and push your
tongue forward, creating a
little explosion of air. Keep
your teeth slightly open;
this will let you make a
different sound than the
/ch/ sound where you
keep your teeth closed

 - Read the first sentence on Activity Page 14.1, pronouncing the tricky spelling
/g/: “He did a /m/ /a/ /g/ /i/ /k/ trick.” Ask if that sounds right.


 - Explain that since /m/ /a/ /g/ /i/ /k/ sounds wrong, students need to try
pronouncing it the second way.


 - Read the sentence again, pronouncing the tricky spelling /j/: “He did a
/m/ /a/ /j/ /i/ /k/ trick.” Point out that ‘i’ follows ‘g’. Ask if that sounds right.


 - Write _magic_ in the “/j/” column to indicate the ‘g’ in magic is pronounced like
the ‘g’ in _gem_ .


 - Complete the remaining sentences on Activity Page 14.1. On their own, have
students first find and circle ‘g’ in the words. Then call on students to read the
sentence aloud, trying the tricky spelling both ways. Students should choose
the pronunciation that sounds right and/or makes sense and print the word

**Note to Teacher**


This is the first spelling assessment students will take in Grade 2. As with the
other procedures you have taught, you will want to take time and carefully
explain what the expectations are for this activity each week. Students will
write the words and the dictation phrase on Activity Page 15.1.


Today you will listen to Group 2 read aloud. Although they may be more
independent, they are still in need of instruction. It is important for all
students to read aloud on a regular basis.

~~**SPELLING ASSESSMENT**~~


  - Remind students this is the one time during the week that they will not be
allowed to consult their Individual Code Chart.


  - Before beginning, make sure students have Activity Page 15.1 in front of them.


  - Tell students they are to write the word you say.


  - Read the first word, use it in a sentence, and then read the word only once
more, allowing time for students to write the word. Repeat the procedure
with each of the remaining words.

  - Direct students’ attention to the lines on the bottom of the activity page. Tell
students to write the phrase _a picnic wish_ on those lines. Slowly repeat the
phrase twice.


  - After all the words and the phrase have been called out, tell students you will
now show them the correct spelling for each word so they can correct their
own work.


  - Say and write each word on the board, instructing students to correct their
work by crossing out any incorrect spelling and copying and writing the
correct spelling next to it.


  - Continue through all the words and then onto the phrase. Remind students of
the importance of correcting and learning from mistakes.

~~**REVIEW TRICKY SPELLING ‘C’ (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students some spellings can be pronounced more than one way. Tell
them these spellings are called tricky spellings.


  - On **Consonant Code Flip Book page 5**, point to the Spelling Card that
shows ‘c’ as a spelling for /k/. Remind the students they have already
learned that ‘c’ can be pronounced /k/.


  - Draw the following chart one section at a time to demonstrate how ‘c’ is a
tricky spelling.



Code Materials












  - On the left of the board or chart paper, begin by writing /k/ and below it the
words _can_, _cap_, and _cot_ and read the words aloud.


  - Point out the spelling ‘c’ is pronounced /k/ in these words.

Lesson 15 Assessment and Review: Spelling Assessment and Tricky Spelling ‘c’
**177**


Activity Page 15.2




 - Explain ‘c’ is a tricky spelling because it can also be pronounced as /s/.


 - Explain that ‘c’ is often pronounced /s/ when it is followed by the letters ‘e’ or
‘i’, as in words like _cent_ and _citrus_ .


 - On the right side of the board, write /s/ and below it the words _cent_, _citrus_,
and _cell_ . Read the words aloud.


 - Point out the spelling ‘c’ is pronounced /s/ in these words.


 - Write the letter ‘c’ on the board between the two sets of words and circle
the spelling.


 - Tell students that in order to figure out how to pronounce this tricky spelling,
they may need to try sounding it out two different ways.


 - Draw one arrow from ‘c’ to the /k/ words and label it ‘1’. Draw a second arrow
from ‘c’ to the /s/ words and label it ‘2’.


 - Explain /k/ is the most likely pronunciation option and therefore the one
they should try first. If that does not sound right, or does not make sense in
context, they should try option 2, /s/.


 - Distribute the red markers.


 - Show students the ‘c’ > /s/ ( _cent_ ) Spelling Card and add it to the appropriate
card on **Consonant Code Flip Book page 11** . Have students outline the
appropriate card in the **Individual Code Chart** on **page 3** .


 - Point out and discuss the power bar for each spelling.

 - Have students underline the ‘c’ in the example words on the right: _cent_,
_citrus_, and _cell_ . Review the /s/ sound.


 - Have students point to ‘c’ in the word in the first sentence.


 - Read the first sentence on the activity page, pronouncing the tricky spelling
/k/: “The king got the /p/ /r/ /i/ /n/ /k/ /e/ /s/ a kitten.”


 - Ask students if that sounds right.


 - Explain that, since /p/ /r/ /i/ /n/ /k/ /e/ /s/ does not sound right, students
need to try it the second way.


 - Read the sentence again, pronouncing the tricky spelling /s/: “The king got
the /p/ /r/ /i/ /n/ /s/ /e/ /s/ a kitten.”


 - Ask students if that sounds right. _(Yes:_ princess _is a word, and it makes sense_
_in this context because a princess is the daughter of a king.)_


 - Show students how to write _princess_ in the “ _cent_ ” column to indicate the ‘c’ in
_princess_ is pronounced like the ‘c’ in _cent_ .


 - Complete the remaining sentences on the activity page, asking students to
underline the ‘c’ and calling on students to read the sentences aloud, trying
the tricky spelling both ways. Have students select the pronunciation that
sounds right and/or makes sense and print the word in the correct column.

When students have completed the activity page, ask them which pronunciation

seems to be more common. _(/k/ is more common)_

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


The sound /qu/ is actually two sounds (/k/ + /w/). You can either teach this
as two sounds or just glide over it without drawing attention to the fact. If
you have good listeners, some of them may hear that /qu/ is actually /k/ +
/w/.


As you review the digraph spellings, you may also wish to review the sounds
that the single letters generally stand for. For example, when introducing
‘wh’ you might cover the ‘h’, leaving only the ‘w’ visible, and ask, “What sound
would you say if you saw this in a word?” Then you could cover the ‘w’, leaving
only the ‘h’ visible, and ask, “What sound would you say if you saw this in a
word?” Then show the digraph.


Avoid speaking of “silent letters” when discussing spellings like ‘wr’ and ‘kn’.
Just say that these two letters stand for one sound, in the same way ‘sh’ and
‘ch’ stand for one sound.


**Foundational Skills**

  - Prepare to display the Consonant Code Flip Book within view of all students;
also have the Spelling Cards listed in the Lesson at a Glance chart, student
Individual Code Charts, and red markers readily available.


**Reading**

  - At the start of the week, make a copy of the blank Anecdotal Reading Record
provided in Teacher Resources. Over the course of the week, be sure to listen
to each student read at least once and note student performance in the
Anecdotal Reading Record.

**Primary Focus**
Students will review the consonant digraph sound/spellings /n/ > ‘kn’, /r/ > ‘wr’,


Students will circle letters to form words matching a series of pictures, and will
write one-syllable words where /n/ > ‘kn’, /r/ > ‘wr’, /w/ > ‘wh’, and /qu/ > ‘qu’.


~~**TEKS 2.2.B.ii; TEKS 2.2.C.i; TEKS 2.2.C.ii; TEKS 2.2.C.iv**~~


~~**REVIEW SPELLING ALTERNATIVES (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Today’s letter-sound correspondences can be found on these pages of the
Consonant Code Flip Book:


**Consonant Code Flip Book**



1. ‘kn’ > /n/ _(knock)_ **page 16**


2. ‘wr’ > /r/ ( _wrist_ ) **page 18**



3. ‘wh’ > /w/ ( _when_ ) **page 21**


4. ‘qu’ > /qu/ _(quit)_ **page 25**



**188**




  - Tell students that today you are going to focus on some spellings for
consonant sounds found mostly at the beginning of words. Remember to
review previously taught spellings as well.


  - Write the spelling ‘kn’ on the board and ask students, “If you saw this
spelling in a word, what would you say?” Remind students the spelling ‘kn’ is
pronounced /n/.


  - Once students have provided the sound(s), ask them for the letter names.


  - Summarize the information: “When we see the letters ‘k’ and ‘n’ side by side
like this, we recognize they make up a single spelling and we say /n/.”


  - Show the students the ‘kn’ > /n/ ( _knock_ ) Spelling Card. Have students read
the sample word. Discuss what the power bar tells us about this spelling.


  - Add the Spelling Card to **Consonant Code Flip Book page 16** .


**TEKS 2.2.B.ii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words with silent letters such as knife and gnat;
**TEKS 2.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling one-syllable and multisyllabic words with closed
syllables; open syllables: VCe syllables: vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables, and final stable

2. ‘wr’ > /r/ ( _wrist_ ) **page 5**



3. ‘wh’ > /w/ ( _when_ ) **page 5**


4. ‘qu’ > /qu/ _(quit)_ **page 6**




 - Repeat this process for the other spellings, writing each spelling on the board
and adding its Spelling Card to the Consonant Code Flip Book. Ask students
each time to outline the appropriate card and the letter spelling in their
Individual Code Charts.


 - Remember to point out and discuss the power bar for each spelling.


~~**PRACTICE SPELLING ALTERNATIVES (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask students to turn to Activity Page 16.1.


 - Guide students through the first two items. First, ask students to name the
picture, then circle the letters that spell the picture name. Then ask students
to write the picture name on the line provided.

and discuss how the
words are very similar
but have slightly different
meanings. Act out
situations as a class where
the shades of meaning
are more obvious. For
example, “I may _tug_ a
blanket up under my chin
to get comfortable, but
I may _yank_ a toy out of
my friend’s hand when I

  - Ask students to turn to the table of contents and locate the story that comes
after “The Ham.” Ask students to tell you the page number on which “The
Fish” starts. _(page 22)_


  - Tell students there is another punctuation mark to look for in this story. In
this story they will see the comma. A comma in a sentence means to take a
tiny break when reading. Write a comma on the board.


  - Direct students’ attention to **page 26** . Model for them how the sentence,
_Then, rip!_ might be read with a small pause. Then model for them how to read
_munch, munch, munch_ with a pause between each word. You might practice
as a whole class. Also tell students a comma never comes at the beginning or
end of a sentence but always somewhere within the sentence.

  - Each team takes a “turn at bat” as follows:


    - Pick a card from the pile and ask the first person on the team to read it.
If the word is read correctly, draw a line from home plate to first base,
signifying a “hit.” This player should go to the back of the team’s line, while
the next player comes forward to read the next card. If he or she reads the
word correctly, draw a line from first to second base. Play continues in this
way so that each time a player reads a word correctly, a line is drawn to the
next base. If the fourth player reads the word correctly, draw a line from
third base to home plate and mark “1 run” for this team. Play continues by
the members of this team so long as no words are misread. When a word is
misread, the next team takes its turn at bat.


  - As in the actual game of baseball, any “players left on base” when a word is
misread do not count or add to the score.

**Primary Focus:** Students will rearrange scrambled sentences to create complete
sentences with proper capitalization and punctuation. ~~**TEKS 2.11.D.x**~~


~~**SENTENCE CAPITALIZATION AND PUNCTUATION**~~


  - Remind students they have reviewed three different types of ending
punctuation. Ask them to tell you the names of the punctuation types and
what purpose they serve. _(period, end of sentence; question mark, end of a_
_sentence that is a question; exclamation point, end of a sentence that is read_
_with excitement)_


  - Next, ask students what type of letter is used to start the first word of a
sentence. _(a capital letter)_


  - Tell students today they are going to work again with scrambled sentences,
reminding them that in order to make sense, the words on the board need to
be placed in a different order to create a sentence.


  - Referring to the scrambled sentences you wrote on the board, have the
class read each word of the first sentence aloud exactly as it is written on
the board. Ask students to orally suggest different ways the words may
be reordered to make a meaningful sentence. There is more than one way
to reorder the words; this may result in a sentence that is a statement, a
question, or even an exclamation.


  - Ask a student to come to the board to write the correct capitalization and
ending punctuation for each oral sentence created as a group. Instruct the
rest of the class to monitor what students are writing and to be ready to
indicate what changes each student makes in rewriting the words and why.

Foundational Skills 1


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today you will review the past tense marker – _ed_ . In English, the past tense of
a verb is frequently marked by adding the letters ‘ed’ to the end of the root
word. The letters ‘ed’ can be pronounced three different ways:


    - /e/ + /d/ as in _started_


    - /d/ as in _filled_


    - /t/ as in _asked_


The pronunciation of the past tense marker is determined by the sound
preceding it—that is, by the last sound in the root word to which the ‘ed’
ending is added.


After **voiced consonant sounds** (/b/, /g/, /v/, /th/, /z/, /zh/, /j/, /n/, /m/,
/ng/, /l/, /r/) and after vowel sounds (all of which are voiced), the past tense
marker is pronounced as a voiced /d/ as in _filled, hugged,_ and _sighed_ .


After **voiceless consonant sounds** (/p/, /k/, /f/, /th/, /s/, /sh/, /ch/), the
past tense marker is pronounced as a voiceless /t/ as in _asked_ or _fished_ .


After the **sounds /t/ and /d/**, the past tense marker is pronounced /ed/ as
in _started_ and _added_ . This is the pronunciation you would expect based on
the spelling ‘ed’, /e/ /d/, but it is actually much less common than the other
pronunciations.


It is the **sound** preceding the past tense marker (particularly the voiced or
unvoiced nature of the sound) that determines the pronunciation of the past
tense marker, **not the spelling** .


Although these guidelines may sound confusing, most students are able
to master the pronunciation of past tense endings fairly rapidly, **without**
**learning any pronunciation rules** . This is partly because students have
heard many past tense verbs in oral speech. Having heard the word _tagged_
in oral speech in sentences like, “I tagged you,” they are less likely to give the
printed form of the word a two-syllable pronunciation (i.e., /t/ /a/ /g/ /e/
/d/). Their mouths will also tend to guide them to the correct pronunciation.
It is much easier to say _rinsed_ with a /t/ at the end than to say it with a
/d/ at the end. The mouth resists the shift from voiceless to voiced that is
required to say /r/ /i/ /n/ /s/ /d/.


Lesson 19 Review: Tricky Words
**221**


**222**



Because memory of the spoken form provides a starting point for many
words and because the mouth tends to resist at least some erroneous
pronunciations, most of the students will be able to learn to pronounce the
past-tense endings in words like _dropped, rinsed,_ and _hosed_ correctly after
the introduction provided here, and some practice.


**Foundational Skills**

 - Write all of the Tricky Words reviewed in previous lessons ( _he, she, we, be, me,_
_the, a, was, from, of, to, do, down, how, what, where, why, once, one, two_ ) on the
board at a level where students will be able to tap them with a ruler or a pointer
or be prepared to use the Tricky Word Wall.


 - Prepare to display the Consonant Code Flip Book within view of all students;
also have the Spelling Cards listed in the Lesson at a Glance chart, student
Individual Code Charts, and red markers readily available.

**Universal Access**

 - Write decodable words ending with _–ed_ on individual index cards for
students to sort by the sound ‘ed’ makes: _thanked_, _rested_, _spilled_, _camped_,
_dropped_, _trimmed_, _yelled_, _folded_, _acted_ .

Lesson 19 Review: Tricky Words
**223**


Code Materials




- Explain that these letters, ‘ed’, are pronounced differently depending on the
sounds that come before them:


  - The letters ‘ed’ may be pronounced the expected way: **/e/ + /d/** . Write
the word _acted_ on the board in the **/e/ + /d/** column. Underline the past
tense marker ‘ed’. Read the word _acted_ and use it in a sentence.


  - The letters ‘ed’ may be pronounced as **/d/** . Write the word _filled_ on the
board in the **/d/** column. Underline the past tense marker ‘ed’. Read the
word _filled_ and use it in a sentence.


  - The letters ‘ed’ may be pronounced as **/t/** . Write the word _asked_ on the
board in the **/t/** column. Underline the past tense marker ‘ed’. Read the
word _asked_ and use it in a sentence.


- Tell students when they see the past tense marker ‘ed’ at the end of a verb,
they should say one of these three pronunciations. Usually students will
not have trouble figuring out which pronunciation to choose because their
mouth will “want” to say one of these. (It is difficult and “sounds wrong” to
pronounce /d/ after sounds where /t/ is the regular pronunciation, and
vice versa.)


- Using the same procedure as in earlier lessons, review the following lettersound correspondences found on these pages of the Consonant Code
Flip Book:


**Consonant Code Flip Book**


1. ‘ed’ > /t/ ( _asked_ ) **page 3**


2. ‘ed’ > /d/ ( _filled)_ **page 4**


- Point out and discuss the power bar for each spelling.


- Add the cards to the appropriate places on the Code Flip Book page.


- Distribute the red markers. Have students outline the appropriate card and
letter spelling in their Individual Code Charts. The spellings for today can be
found on these pages of the Individual Code Chart:

Check for Understanding


Write each of the following past tense verbs on the board, use each word in

a sentence, and ask students where it should be added on the chart: _rested_

(pronunciation 1), _packed_ (pronunciation 3), and _hummed_ (pronunciation 2).


After using each word in a sentence, point to each section of the chart. Students

should use a thumbs-up or thumbs-down to indicate their idea for placement. Take

note of students who are consistently incorrect. Consider meeting with them for a

remediation lesson later.


**Note:** Your completed chart will look like the following:

 - Call students’ attention to the first word which has already been sorted and
then written in the appropriate column. Direct students to read and sort the
remaining words independently.


 - After the words have been sorted on the activity page, read aloud as a class
the story at the bottom of the activity page containing _–ed_ words.

Have students place a
hand on their throat and
say the word _dogs_ . Ask
them if they feel any
vibration, or buzz, on
their hand at the end of
the word. Explain there
is a buzz because this
/z/ sound is made by
the throat. Next, have
the students repeat this
process, but with the
word _cats_ . Help students
understand there is
no buzz because this
/s/ sound is unvoiced.
Air passes through the
mouth, but there is no
vibration in the throat.


~~**ELPS 1.B**~~












  - On the left side of the board or chart paper, begin by writing /s/.


  - Underneath the /s/, write the words _cats_, _dots_, and _sun_ and read the
words aloud.


  - Point out the spelling ‘s’ is pronounced /s/ in these words.


  - Explain the ‘s’ is a tricky spelling because it can also be pronounced /z/.


  - Write /z/ on the board to the right. Explain we often find ‘s’ pronounced /z/
at the end of words.


  - Write some examples on the board under the /z/: _dogs_, _runs_, and _is_ .


  - Make sure students can hear that the last sound in these words is buzzy
(voiced) /z/ rather than unvoiced /s/.


  - Write the letter ‘s’ on the board between the two sets of words and circle
the spelling.


  - Tell students to figure out how to pronounce this tricky spelling, they may
need to try sounding it out two different ways.

 - Draw one arrow from ‘s’ to the /s/ words and label it ‘1’. Draw a second
arrow from ‘s’ to the /z/ words and label it ‘2’. Explain /s/ is the most likely
pronouncing option and therefore the one they should try first. If that
does not sound right, or does not make sense in context, they should try
option 2, /z/.

 - Tell students to find and circle the ‘s’ in the first sentence.


 - Read the first sentence on the activity page, pronouncing the tricky spelling
/s/: “He handed me /h/ /i/ /s/ pet pig.”


 - Ask students if that sounds right. _(No:_ hiss _is a word, but it does not make_
_sense in this context.)_


 - Explain that because /h/ /i/ /s/ sounds wrong, they need to try pronouncing
it the second way.


 - Read the sentence again, pronouncing the tricky spelling /z/: “He handed me
/h/ /i/ /z/ pet pig.”


 - Ask students if that sounds right. _(Yes:_ his _is a word and it makes sense in_
_this context.)._


Foundational Skills 1


Tell students that _his_ in the “dogs” column to indicate the ‘s’ in _his_ is
pronounced like the ‘s’ in _dogs_ .




 - Complete the remaining sentences on the activity page, having students first
find and underline ‘s’ in the words on their own.


Activity Page 20.2: Tricky Spelling ‘s’


Call on students to read the sentences aloud, trying the tricky spelling both ways,

and then selecting the pronunciation that sounds right and/or makes sense. Have

students print the word in the correct column. Ask students which pronunciation

seems to be more common. _(/s/ is more common)_ Collect the activity page and

review students’ performance. Make note of students who would benefit from

additional practice.

 - Begin by writing _sand_, _hunt_, and _thin_ on the board. Read these words
aloud and tell students that they are pronounced the expected way (i.e. ‘n’
spells /n/).


 - Next write _sang_, _hung_, and _thing_ . Read the words aloud and tell students that
they are also pronounced as we would expect (i.e., ‘ng’ spells /ng/).


 - Write the last three words, _sank_, _hunk_, and _think_ . Tell students that when ‘n’ is
followed by ‘k’ at the end of a word, the ‘n’ sometimes sounds like /ng/. Say
these words aloud.


 - To hear the /ng/ sound, point to the words and say _sang_ and then _sank_, _hung_
and then _hunk_, _thing_, and then _think_ .


 - Point out that /ng/ is sometimes spelled ‘ng’. Point out that /ng/ is also
sometimes spelled ‘n’ when followed by ‘k’.


 - Turn to **Consonant Code Flip Book page 17** and put the Spelling Card on
the appropriate Flip Book page. Discuss the power bar.


 - Pass out the red markers.


 - Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart page 4** . Guide students in
outlining the appropriate card and letter spelling on the chart.


**Note:** the /ng/ sound for ‘n’ is subtle and more noticeable in different
regions. Do not worry or spend a lot of time over this difference if it is not
noticeable to your class.


 - Explain that the Tricky Word for the spelling list is _should_ .


 - The words for this week are:



1. sand


2. hunt

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Score all parts of the End-of-Unit Assessment administered today immediately
so you can select appropriate Pausing Point activities for students to complete
during the remaining three days of this week.


You may also use Pausing Point days to administer the optional Tricky Word
Assessment included in Teacher Resources to specific students that you
suspect may not have thoroughly mastered the Tricky Words reviewed in
this unit.


Remember to give the spelling assessment at the end of the week using the
following word list. Have students use Activity Page 22.5 for the assessment.


Use the Lesson 21 analysis chart and directions in Teacher Resources to
analyze students’ spelling errors. This will help you to understand any error
patterns beginning to develop within your classroom or persisting among
individual students.

Look out for
mispronunciations of
the verb _say_ . Across the
tenses the pronunciation
changes. Students
may inaccurately apply
phonetic understanding
of ‘ay’ > /ae/ ( _say_ )
when first attempting
_says_, and possibly _said_ .
Understanding these
differences will help you
assist students as they
learn the Tricky Words.


Present/Future Tense:
‘ay’ > /ae/ ( _say_ )


Present Tense 3 [rd] Person:
‘ay’ > /e/ ( _says_ )


Past Tense: ‘ai’ > /e/ ( _said_ )


~~**ELPS 3.C**~~


**254**



**Primary Focus**
Students will read the Tricky Words _there_, _said_, _says_, and _word_ . ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.vii**~~


Students will listen to dictated words and select the correct word from a list of four
printed words with similar spellings. ~~**TEKS 2.2.B.iii**~~


~~**TRICKY WORDS: THERE, SAID, SAYS, WORD (10 MIN.)**~~


  - For each Tricky Word card, begin by reading the word. Next, discuss which
part of the word is read just as one would expect and which part is tricky.
Finally, use the word in an oral sentence.


**Tricky Word: There**

  - **Expected:** The letters ‘t’ ‘h’ are pronounced /th/. **Tricky:** The letters ‘e_e’
together with the letter ‘r’ are pronounced /ae/ /r/.


**Tricky Word: Said**

  - **Expected:** The letter ‘s’ is pronounced /s/ and the letter ‘d’ is pronounced
/d/. **Tricky:** The letters ‘ai’ are pronounced /e/.


**Tricky Word: Says**

  - **Expected:** The first ‘s’ is pronounced /s/ and the final ‘s’ is pronounced /z/.
**Tricky:** The letters ‘ay’ are pronounced /e/.


**Tricky Word: Word**

  - **Expected:** The letter ‘w’ is pronounced /w/ and the letter ‘d’ is pronounced
/d/. **Tricky:** the letters ‘or’ are pronounced /er/.


  - Add these new Tricky Word cards to the Tricky Word Wall.


**TEKS 2.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (vii) identifying and reading high-frequency words from a
research-based list; (iii) decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams,
including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables.

Clip the edges of each half of the game board, just inside the dotted line.
Tape the left side of the board onto the right side. Prepare the four record
cards and cut them apart.


 - Set up the board and make sure each student has a record card, a game
token, and a pencil. (You can use chips or small squares of colored paper for
game tokens.) You will also need one regular six-sided die.


 - Explain that the goal of the game is to be the first player to collect two
examples of each of the spellings listed on the record card.


 - Have students place their tokens on the star. Have each student roll the die.
The student with the highest score goes first.


 - Have the first player roll the die and move his or her token the number of
spaces indicated on the die. Note that after moving onto the board, the
player will be able to choose to move up or down. Students can move up,
down, left, or right. Diagonal moves are not permitted.


 - Ask the player to read the word he or she landed on and then copy the word
onto his or her record card on one of the lines for the spelling it contains.


 - Have the next player (moving clockwise) roll the die and move his or her token.


 - Play continues until a student fills the record card with two examples of
each spelling.


**Note:** Spaces with an asterisk contain words that have more than one
spelling for the /s/ sound. Students who land on a space with an asterisk can
copy the word onto their card twice. By navigating to these spaces, students
can fill up their record cards more quickly.


**Spelling Search Game: ‘j’, ‘g’, and ‘ge’ > /j/**


**Note:** This game is intended for groups of two to six students who have
learned the spellings ‘j’ as in _jet_, ‘g’ as in _rage_, and ‘ge’ as in _twinge_ . It is
played the same way as the game described previously. See pages at the end
of the Pausing Point for the game boards and cards.


**Spelling Card Game**

 - Remove the Spelling Cards for sound/spellings reviewed in this unit from the
Code Flip Books.


 - Give one or two students a subset of the Spelling Cards, representing two to
six sounds and six to fifteen spellings for those sounds.


 - Ask students to sort the cards by sound, so each sound has its own row (e.g.,
there is one row for /s/, one row for /z/, one row for /k/).


Foundational Skills 1


 - Ask students to place the Spelling Cards for each sound in order of frequency
using the power bars.


 - Ask what students remember about the various spellings for a sound: Are
there any used at the beginning of a word? Any not used at the beginning of a
word?, etc.


~~**MORE HELP WITH TRICKY WORDS**~~


 - The following box contains all of the Tricky Words for Unit 1.



19. one

10. from


11. to


12. do


13. down


14. how


15. what


16. where


17. why


18. once




  - Write at least twelve Tricky Words from the list above on the board at a level
where students will be able to tap them with a ruler.


  - Divide the class into two teams and have them line up at the board.


  - Call out a Tricky Word. Two students, one from each team, will race to the
board to find the word and tap it with their ruler. The first student to find the
word and tap it earns a point for their team.


**Tricky Word Relay**

  - Write the Tricky Words listed in the previous box on two sets of yellow
index cards.


  - Divide the class into two teams. Have students line up by team on one side of
the classroom and place each set of Tricky Words in two separate baskets or
containers on a table or desk some distance away from where the teams are
lined up.


Pausing Point
**271**


**272**




 - When you give the signal, two students, one from each team, will go to the
table to pick out a Tricky Word from his team’s basket to read. However,
before moving, students must wait to hear your directions as to how they
may move to get a Tricky Word. Here are some ideas.


1. Hop on the same foot.


2. Hop on alternate feet.


3. Jump with hands on hips.


4. Walk toe to toe.


5. Walk with hands grasping ankles.


6. Walk crossing one leg over the other.


7. Walk on tiptoe.


 - The first student to pull a Tricky Word out of the basket and read it correctly
earns a point for his/her team.


**Tricky Word Bingo**

 - Prepare the Tricky Word Bingo game boards. There are fifteen different game
boards. Give each student a different one. Students may use some sort of
tokens, such as checkers or colored squares of paper, to cover a word that is
called, or you may direct them to mark words with a pencil.


 - Tell students you are going to say some Tricky Words. Each time you say a
Tricky Word, students should look at their cards to see if the Tricky Word is
printed on it. If it is, students should mark the square where the Tricky Word
is printed.


 - Prior to starting play for the first time, hold up a bingo card or draw one on
the board. Tell students they can yell out “bingo” if they mark five words in a
straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Explain that the square with
the star is a free space they can use as one of their five spaces.


 - Draw words to call from your set of Tricky Word cards and pause to give
the students a chance to mark their bingo cards. Continue until a student
says “Bingo.”


 - Ask that student to read aloud his or her bingo words. As that student reads,
check whether you said the words and whether the words are printed in a
straight line. If so, the student wins. If not, continue saying words from the list
until another student says “bingo.”


Foundational Skills 1


**Tricky Word Clues**

  - On the board, write three to six Tricky Words taught in this unit.


  - Choose one word and then give students clues about that word.


  - Clues could include the number of letters in the word, what the first and/
or last letter in the word is, and what part of the word is tricky. Once
students have found the right word, ask them to read the word and use it in
a sentence.


**Tricky Word Concentration**

  - Using two sets of Tricky Word cards, select eight pairs of the same words
from each set. (You can increase the number of cards in each game to
provide a greater challenge.)


  - Shuffle the cards and lay them face down on the table, so there are four rows
of four cards each.


  - Have students turn over two cards at a time, attempting to find matching
cards. Each time a pair is turned over, the student must read each word.


Pausing Point
**273**


**274**




 - If a student finds a match, he or she may keep the cards so long as he or she
has read the words correctly.


 - Let the game continue until all matches have been found. The person or team
with the most cards is the winner.


~~**MORE HELP WITH GRAMMAR**~~


**Past Tense Marker –ed**

 - Write the following sentences on the board and have students read them
aloud. Point out that the verb _dusts_ is in the present tense, while _dusted_ is the
past tense.


Mom dusts the shelf. Mom dusted the shelf.


 - Underline the ending ‘ed’ in _dusted._ Point out that ‘ed’ is read as /e/ /d/, just
as one would expect. Explain that ‘ed’ is the past tense marker that shows
the action has already happened.


 - Write the sentences below on the board and have students read them aloud.


Ben spells the word. Ben spelled the word.


 - Ask students if they see a difference between the two sentences.


 - Point out that the verb in the first sentence is in present tense and the verb in
the second sentence is in past tense.


 - Underline the ending ‘ed’ in _spelled_, which is pronounced /d/ in this example.
Again, point out ‘ed’ is the past tense marker that shows that the action has
already happened.


 - Write the following sentences, including the omission, on the board:


Jen brushes the dog. Jen the dog.


 - Tell students the sentence with the omission is in past tense.


 - Ask students to fill in the blank with the verb _brush_ in past tense. Have a
student come up to the board and write the word in the blank. _(brushed)_


 - Point out in this example, the past tense marker ‘ed’ is pronounced /t/.


Foundational Skills 1


  - Repeat with the sentences below:


Pat plants the grass.


Pat the grass. _(planted)_


Dad grills two hot dogs.


Dad two hot dogs. _(grilled)_


~~**MORE HELP WITH CAPITALIZATION AND PUNCTUATION**~~


**Scrambled Sentences**

  - Using decodable words and familiar Tricky Words, write a scrambled
sentence on the board. Ask students to unscramble the words to create a
sentence that makes sense, then ask one student to come to the board to
rewrite the sentence using appropriate capitalization and punctuation.


  - Here are some sample sentences to help you get started; note that some
sentences may be unscrambled as either statements or questions.


1. hat have the black a did witch


2. elves danced the princess twelve with


3. dishes the the sink stink in


4. must fast we act


5. insects mom upset with did get the


6. in me let


7. is how she

- Draw a “yellow” word from the Tricky Word basket and a “green” word from
the decodable word basket and ask each student to make up an original
sentence using the word cards. Students should have paper and pencil or dry
erase boards and markers to write their sentences. Remind students to use
appropriate capitalization and punctuation when writing their sentences.


- Ask each student to read his or her sentence. Check for appropriate
capitalization and punctuation and award points as shown in the bar
that follows:



**Capitalization**



**Punctuation**



**276**



First word in the sentence 1 point Period 1 point


Proper noun 1 point Question mark 2 points


Exclamation mark 2 points


Foundational Skills 1


 - Depending on students’ skill level, you may also want to award points for
accurate spelling.


 - Modify the difficulty according to students’ needs. You can make the task
more challenging by pulling several yellow and green cards and stipulating
that all of the words pulled must be used in a sentence.


 - You can make the task easier by pulling only one yellow and one green card,
and orally create a single sentence as a group that each student must then
write and punctuate.


**Editing Practice**

 - Tell students to read each sentence on Activity Page PP.11 and then
write it correctly on the line below it, using appropriate capitalization
and punctuation.

~~**SAMPLE ANECDOTAL READING RECORD**~~


Below is an example of a completed Anecdotal Reading Record. A blank Anecdotal Reading Record
is found on the next page. You will need to make a copy of the blank Anecdotal Reading Record for
each student. As you listen to each student read, make notes about his or her reading ability in his
or her respective Reading Record.


**Name: T. Ellis**


Lesson: 11 (The Hot Dog)

Page 2: T. said “shef” for “shelf”. Page 4: T. said “shef” for “shelf” in the second line but read the word correctly further
down the page. He paused before “himself” and sounded out ‘self’ but didn’t blend the whole word correctly.


Lesson: 13 (The Chicken Nugget)

Page 6: T. dropped the ‘en’ from “chicken” twice. Page 8: He read “sprung” for “sprang.” He self-corrected when he
misread the ‘est’ in “biggest.”

Recommendation: Encourage T. to systematically finger track all text from left to right and take his time reading.


Lesson: 16 (The Ham)

Page 16: T. read without acknowledging different punctuation (?, !, ? in a row); his voice stayed the same as he read
each sentence. He read “spots” for “spotted”. Page 18: He read “Clang!” appropriately, acknowledging the exclamation
point. Page 20: He read the onomatopoeia words with good inflection for the exclamation points.


Lesson: 18 (The Milk)

Page 28: T. self-corrected when he misread “grinned”. Page 30: He used good inflection to show he understood the use of
exclamation points.


Lesson: 21 (The Chips)

Page 34: T. said “long” for “log”; he read “long” correctly a few sentences above. Page 36: He transposed words in the
second sentence. He omitted “went” in the last sentence. He seemed to be racing through the text. Page 38: He did not
acknowledge the exclamation point after “Slash”.

Recommendation: Encourage T. to take his time reading. Additional practice reading sentences with varied
punctuation may be helpful.

~~**LESSON 15: SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


Write students’ names in the column provided. The words on today’s spelling assessment include
varied spelling patterns. Place an X in the column of any spelling pattern that the student did not
spell correctly. Examine errors for patterns using the information provided below. If a pattern is
identified, speak with the student and ask him or her to explain his or her thinking to you. This may
help you understand the student’s confusion and allow you to clear up the misunderstanding.


Columns 1 and 2


**What an error in these columns mean:** The spelling ‘e’ for the /e/ sound and ‘i’ for the /i/ sound
are basic code spellings. It is common for first- and second-grade students to confuse these vowels.
It is hard for them to hear the difference between two very similar-sounding vowels.


**What you should do:** Word sorts and exposure to words with ‘e’ and ‘i’ as medial vowel sounds will
increase students’ comfort levels with choosing the correct spelling for each sound.


Column 3


**What an error in this column means:** ‘sh’, ‘th’, and ‘ch’ are consonant digraph spellings. These
students do not understand the concept of two letters making one sound.


**What you should do:** Word sorts and exposure to words with consonant digraphs will increase
students’ comfort levels with choosing the correct spelling for each sound.


Column 4


**What an error in this column means:** ‘nk’, ‘lf’, ‘spr’, ‘ng’, ‘dr’, ‘ft’ are consonant clusters. These are blends
of the letter sounds in the clusters. These students are having difficulty differentiating each sound in the
cluster(s).


**What you should do:** Word sorts and exposure to words with consonant clusters will increase
students’ comfort levels with choosing the correct spelling for each sound.

Column 5


**What an error in this column means:** The word _she_ is a Tricky Word. Tricky Words do not follow the
rules for encoding that students have learned thus far.


**What you should do:** For now, students should memorize how to spell this Tricky Word. Additional
practice reading and writing Tricky Words can be found in the Pausing Point.


Column 6


In the last column, specifically note any other confusion evidenced by individual student errors.
Analyze any patterns and provide targeted remediation.

Write students’ names in the column provided. The words on today’s spelling assessment include
adding _–ing_ to words that do not require first doubling the final consonant and words that do require
first doubling the final consonant. In addition, there are other two-syllable words. Place an X in the
column of any word that the student did not spell correctly. Examine errors for patterns using the
information provided below. If a pattern is identified, speak with the student and ask him or her to
explain his or her thinking to you. This may help you understand the student’s confusion and allow
you to clear up the misunderstanding.


Numbers 1, 2


**What an error in these words means:** Adding _–ing_ to these words requires first doubling the
final consonant. These students did not correctly identify that the final consonant needs to first be
doubled before adding _–ing_ .


**What you should do:** Practice identifying and writing words that require first doubling the final
consonant before adding suffixes will increase students’ comfort levels with choosing the correct
spelling for each sound.


Numbers 3, 5, 7, 8, 9


**What an error in these words means:** Adding _–ing_ to these words does not require first doubling
the final consonant; these words end with double consonant spellings. These students did not
correctly identify that the base word ends with a double consonant spelling.


**What you should do:** Practice identifying and writing words that require first doubling the final
consonant before adding suffixes will increase students’ comfort levels with choosing the correct
spelling for each sound.


Numbers 4, 10


**What an error in these words means:** These are two-syllable short vowel words. These students are
having difficulty differentiating each sound in each syllable.


**What you should do:** Word sorts and exposure to words with consonant clusters will increase
students’ comfort levels with choosing the correct spelling for each sound.

Write students’ names in the column provided. The words on today’s spelling assessment include
differentiating between the /n/ and /ng/ sounds. Place an X in the column of any word that the
student did not spell correctly. Examine errors for patterns using the information provided below.
If a pattern is identified, speak with the student and ask him or her to explain his or her thinking
to you. This may help you understand the student’s confusion and allow you to clear up the
misunderstanding.


Numbers 1, 4, 7


**What an error in these words means:** These words contain ‘n’ > /n/. These students are having
difficulty identifying that ‘n’ makes the /n/ sound.


**What you should do:** Practice identifying and writing words that simply have ‘n’ > /n/ will increase
students’ comfort levels with choosing the correct spelling for each sound.


Numbers 2, 5, 8


**What an error in these words means:** These words contain ‘ng’ > /ng/. These students are having
difficulty identifying that ‘ng’ work together to make the sound /ng/.


**What you should do:** Practice identifying and writing words that have ‘ng’ > /ng/ will increase
students’ comfort levels with choosing the correct spelling for the sound. Word sorts and exposure
to words with similar spellings will also help students differentiate sounds and spellings.


Numbers 3, 6, 9


**What an error in these words means:** These words contain ‘n’ > /ng/ followed by ‘k’ > /k/. These
students are having difficulty identifying that when ‘n’ is followed by ‘k’ in a word, ‘n’ often makes the
/ng/ sound.


**What you should do:** Practice identifying and writing words that have ‘n’ > /ng/ will increase
students’ comfort levels with choosing the correct spelling for the sound. Word sorts and exposure
to words with similar spellings will also help students differentiate sounds and spellings.

~~**END-OF-UNIT ASSESSMENT ANALYSIS—UNIT 1**~~


  - Write students’ names in the appropriate column of the Assessment Recording Sheet that follows.


  - For the **Word Recognition Assessment** (Activity Page 22.1), indicate any errors in columns 1 to 10.
Particular attention should be given to any column that has an error. When analyzing these errors,
use a clean unmarked copy of the dictation page and have the student read the line containing the
error. Then ask the student to point and say aloud the correct word for that line. The student’s oral
response will let you know if it was a careless error or if the student needs additional instruction. Use
the following to assist your remediation.


  - For any items that require students to write responses, look for and assess students’ ability to form
letters accurately.

  - Indicate errors from the **Punctuation Assessment** (Activity Page 22.2) on which students added
punctuation to sentences. If students made more than three errors, it may indicate a need for
additional instruction or reteaching. Look for error patterns in punctuation type for additional
information about instructional needs.


  - Indicate errors from the **Suffix –ing Assessment** (Activity Page 22.3). If students make more than
four errors on numbers 4, 5, 6, and 8, it may indicate a need for additional instruction or reteaching.
More than three errors on numbers 2, 3, 7, and 9 may indicate a need for additional instruction
or reteaching.

     - For the **Comprehension Assessment** (Activity Page 22.4), record the number of questions
answered correctly. Any score of less than 3 correct out of 5 is cause for concern. Administer further
assessment by completing the following:


        - Prepare a copy of the story and a blank copy the questions. Ask the student to read the story
aloud to you in a one-on-one setting as you make a running record on the blank copy. Then ask the
student to read aloud the questions. Have the student answer the questions orally.


        - If the student correctly answers the questions and there are no major miscues in the running
record, then it may simply be a matter of carelessness on the part of the student. It may be
worthwhile to use the Pausing Point for students to practice going back to find answers in the text.


     - If the student cannot read the story and/or the questions correctly, there may be a decoding
problem. Carefully review your running record to see which sound/letter combinations are giving the
student difficulty. Then review the results of the Word Recognition Assessment as it may corroborate
the decoding difficulty.

_Instructions_ : This is an optional assessment of Tricky Words reviewed in this unit. At the end of Unit
1, show the student the Tricky Word List which follows this record. Ask the student to read each word
from the list, proceeding in order from top to bottom.


Provide the student with either a blank sheet of paper or card stock to place on the word list page
directly under the row he or she is reading. As the student completes a row, he or she should slide
the paper down just enough to read the next row.


Record the student’s performance on each word in the following chart, using + to indicate that the
word was read correctly and – to indicate the word was read incorrectly; if the student misreads a
completely different word in its place, record the word read by the student. Mark as incorrect any
word that the student does not read within 3–5 seconds.

Appendix A: Overview
of the Skills Strand


~~**THE SIMPLE VIEW OF READING**~~


Virtually everyone who writes about reading now recognizes that reading comprehension requires
more than just decoding ability. Many reading researchers now subscribe to a view of reading that is
known as “the simple view of reading.” This view, which is associated with reading researchers Philip
Gough and William Tunmer, holds that there are two chief elements that are crucially important to
reading comprehension: _decoding skills_ and _language comprehension ability_ .


To achieve reading comprehension, a person needs to be able to decode the words on the page and
then make sense of those words. The first task is made possible by decoding skills and the second
by language comprehension ability. If the person cannot decode the words on the page, she will not
be able to achieve reading comprehension, no matter how much oral language she can understand.
Even if the person _can_ decode the words on the page, that in and of itself is still no guarantee of
reading comprehension. If the sentences the person is attempting to read are sentences she could
not understand if they were read aloud to her, then there is not much hope that she will understand
them during independent reading.


Supporters of the simple view—and there are a growing number of them among reading
researchers—argue that a person’s reading comprehension ability can be predicted, with a high
degree of accuracy, based on two basic measures. The first is a measure of decoding skills (e.g.,
a test of single-word reading or pseudo-word reading). The second is a measure of listening
comprehension. Researchers who hold to the simple view say, “Tell me a person’s decoding ability,
as ascertained by a word-reading task, and tell me that person’s language comprehension ability,
as ascertained by a listening comprehension task, and I can make a very accurate prediction of
that person’s reading comprehension ability.” If the person is a rapid and accurate decoder and
also able to understand a wide range of oral language—for instance, classroom presentations,
news items on the radio or TV, books on tape, etc.—then it is a safe bet the person will also do well
on tests of reading comprehension.


Appendix A
**383**


**384**



An interesting thing about the simple view of reading is that it can be expressed as an equation:


**R = D x C**


In this equation, each of the letters is a variable that stands for a specific skill:


**R** is a measure of reading comprehension ability.


**D** is a measure of decoding skills.


**C** is a measure of language-comprehension ability as measured using a listening task.


Each of these skills can be quantified as a numerical value between 0 and 1, where 0 stands for no
ability whatsoever and 1 stands for perfect, not-to-be-improved-upon ability. Obviously most people
have a skill level that falls somewhere between these two extremes.


The equation says that if you have some decoding ability (D > 0) and you also have some language
comprehension ability (C > 0), you will probably also have some reading comprehension ability (R >
0). How much reading comprehension ability you have will depend on the exact values of D and C.


What does it mean to have no decoding ability (D = 0)? It means you cannot turn printed words into
spoken words. A person who cannot decode letters on a page cannot read. The person is illiterate.


What does it mean to have no language comprehension ability (C = 0)? Basically, it means you do
not know the language, and you cannot understand any of it when you hear other people speaking or
reading aloud in that language.


It is not very common for a person to have decoding ability (D > 0) but not language comprehension
ability (C = 0). Why would you learn to read and write a language you cannot understand? It does
happen. One famous example involves the English poet John Milton, the author of _Paradise Lost_ and
other well-known poems. Milton went blind late in life. Since Braille had not yet been invented, this
meant he could not read for himself. Nevertheless, Milton found a way to keep learning from books:
he had friends and relatives read the books aloud for him. However, he was not always able to find
a scholar who had the free time and the ability needed to read to him in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and
other ancient languages. The solution? Milton taught his daughters to decode these languages so
they could read books in those languages aloud to him. Milton did not teach his daughters the actual
languages—the thousands of words and tens of thousands of meanings _._ That would have been a
difficult, time-consuming task. He only taught them the rules they would need to turn letters into
sounds. Thus, his daughters acquired solid decoding skills for these languages (D > 0), but they
would have scored a zero on any measure of language comprehension (C = 0). They could turn
symbols into sounds, but they had no idea what the sounds meant. Milton, on the other hand, due


Foundational Skills 1


to his blindness, had no functional decoding skills (D = 0). However, by virtue of his great learning,
he was able to understand Hebrew, Latin, and Greek when they were read aloud to him (C > 0).
Between Milton and his daughters, you might say, there was reading comprehension (R), but the
younger generation brought the decoding skills (D) and the elderly poet brought the language
comprehension (C).


The Milton example is an unusual one, but it is possible to give a less unusual one. A decent teacher
can teach you to decode Russian letters (or the letters used in many other writing systems) in the
course of a couple days of intensive work. Since you already know a lot about reading, all you would
need to learn is which sound values the unfamiliar letters stand for. Once you learned that, you
would be able to sound out most of the words in the language, but nobody would claim that you are
_reading_ Russian. You would have some rudimentary decoding skills (D > 0), but you would be lacking
language comprehension (C = 0). You would be able to pronounce words, but you would not be able
to make sense of them. Essentially, you would be doing what Milton’s daughters did.


~~**HOW THESE IDEAS INFORM THIS PROGRAM**~~


Although this may seem very abstract and theoretical, there are two ideas here that are very
important for reading instruction and for understanding this program. The first important idea
is that reading comprehension depends crucially on both decoding skills (D) and language
comprehension ability (C); the second is that language comprehension ability takes much longer to
acquire than decoding skills.


Milton chose to teach his daughters decoding skills because he could teach those relatively quickly.
It would have taken him much, much longer to build up their language comprehension abilities.
Likewise, in the hypothetical example just given, a decent teacher could teach you to decode
Russian print in a few days of intensive instruction, but he or she would need to keep working with
you for many weeks—possibly even many years—to teach you enough Russian words and phrases to
understand a movie, make sense of a radio report, or read a short story.


You are facing a similar situation as a teacher in the early grades. You want your students to learn
to read. A crucial first step is to teach them decoding skills. Strong decoding skills can be taught to
most young children over the course of Grades K–2. It takes longer to teach decoding skills to young
children who are learning to read for the first time than it does to teach the same skills to adults
who have already learned to read in another language, and it takes longer to teach decoding skills in
English-speaking countries because English spelling is rather complex; but even so, most students
can acquire basic decoding ability in the early grades. The children will continue to automatize their
decoding skills, learn new spelling patterns, and build fluency for many more years, but the basics
can be taught in Grades K–2.


That is not the case with language comprehension ability. It is going to take you and your school
system a long time to build up your students’ language comprehension ability because this is not a
job you can accomplish in the course of a single school year. Rather, language comprehension ability


Appendix A
**385**


**386**



is acquired over many years. Your students began to develop a rudimentary ability to understand
language even before they could speak and continued to increase their language comprehension
abilities throughout the preschool years. They will make even more gains in your classroom and the
classrooms they join after yours. With each new sentence they read or hear, and each new subject
they study in school, they will be building up background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural
literacy, and thus increasing the range of materials they are equipped to understand; first orally and
later via reading. The more you teach them and the more you expose them to, the more they will be
able to understand. It takes a long time to build up the vocabulary and knowledge needed to make
sense of most stories in a newspaper or magazine, but this buildup is crucial for your students’
reading abilities: for no matter how good their decoding skills may be, they will not understand what
they read unless they have the language comprehension ability to make sense of the words they
decode.


The program includes two strands of instruction, and these strands correspond with the elements of
reading isolated in the simple view of reading. The Skills Strand is meant to build students’ decoding
skills (D), while the Knowledge Strand is meant to build students’ language comprehension ability
(C) by exposing them to vocabulary, concepts, and ideas through frequent reading aloud. It is
important to understand that _both strands are crucial for reading comprehension in later grades_ .
You may feel the decoding skills taught in the Skills Strand are more important to teach in the early
grades, and certainly this is the area where you can expect to have the most immediate impact,
but it is important that you not neglect language comprehension ability. Remember, it takes many
years to build up enough vocabulary and general knowledge to understand a wide range of printed
materials. The building of background knowledge needs to begin in Kindergarten (if not before) and
continue throughout the elementary and middle school years.


If students are not building their language comprehension ability in the early grades, their reading
scores are likely to begin to fall off in Grade 4 and later. This has been called the “fourth-grade
slump,” and it occurs because material assessed on reading tests changes over time. As students
progress through the grades, test questions focus less on rudimentary decoding skills and more
on comprehension—and comprehension depends on having sufficient vocabulary, background
knowledge, and cultural literacy to understand the words you are decoding. Thus, the importance
of language comprehension ability increases with time. A weakness in this area may not show up on
tests in early grades, but it will show up in later elementary grades.


This has been well documented in research. In one very interesting study, researchers at the
University of Kansas looked at measurements of reading comprehension (R), decoding/word
recognition (D), and listening comprehension (C) for the same 570 students in second, fourth,
and eighth grades. They found the two factors D and C accurately predicted R in each grade,
but that C became more important, in the sense that it explained more of the variation among
students over time. The measure of decoding (D) was extremely important in the second-grade
results. Twenty-seven percent of the variance in reading comprehension in second grade could be
explained by decoding skills (D) alone. Only 9 percent of the variance could be explained by listening
comprehension (C) alone. By fourth grade, however, the measure of listening comprehension


Foundational Skills 1


had begun to account for more variance: the unique contribution of C rose to 21 percent while
the equivalent number for D fell. By eighth grade, fully 36 percent of the variance in reading
comprehension scores could be explained with reference to the children’s listening comprehension
ability. The unique contribution of D sank even further. In other words, while reading comprehension
depended on D and C at every stage, as the simple view would predict, C explained more and more
of the variation among students as time went by. What this tells us is that, once the intricacies of
decoding are mastered (and in English this takes some time), reading comprehension depends more
and more heavily on language comprehension. Language comprehension depends on background
knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural literacy.


~~**TWO MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT READING AND WRITING**~~


The Skills Strand teaches the mechanics of both reading and writing. It is based on the most current
research on reading and writing, but at the same time it has been written in opposition to some
ideas that have been very influential in elementary education in recent decades. Two of those ideas
are:


  - Learning to read and write is natural.


  - Learning to read and write is easy.


Both of these ideas have great emotional appeal. Unfortunately, both of them are wrong.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT NATURAL**~~


Many scholars have argued that spoken language is natural for human beings. The cognitive
scientist Stephen Pinker, for example, has argued that human beings have a language instinct,
meaning that humans are born with an innate capacity for learning language. This may turn out to
be true. It is at least a plausible theory since historians, linguists, and anthropologists have never
found a human culture that does not use language. When something is universal, it may turn out to
be natural.


What is true of oral language is not necessarily true of written language. In fact, with written language,
we know we are dealing with something that is not natural or innate because we know when and where
writing was invented, and we know that, even today, not all languages have a system of writing. There
are still hundreds of languages in the world that are spoken, but not written or read.


Appendix A
**387**


**388**



Ten thousand years ago this was the norm, rather than an exception. At that time, there were
probably no human beings who knew how to read or write. According to the linguist Florian
Coulmas, the idea of writing down language was probably developed independently by three ancient
cultures: the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, and the Chinese. Each used a slightly different system, and
the mechanisms these pioneers developed for recording speech then spread from one culture to
another, evolving as they went. If these initial inventors had not come up with schemes for writing
down speech, we might all be illiterate today.


Writing is many things. It is an art that can be taught and learned. It is an invention—one of the
greatest inventions in human history. It is a technology enabling us to do things we could not do
without it—a technology every bit as exciting and amazing as airplane flight or electric power. But
it is not natural. The same is true of reading, which is simply the process of unpacking, or decoding,
what somebody else has written.


Reading and writing are both highly artificial. We tend to recoil at that word. We have internalized the
idea that natural is good and artificial is bad. Therefore, we think, reading must be natural. In fact, as
the reading researcher Philip Gough has written, reading is a highly unnatural act.


The first step toward good reading and writing instruction is to understand that reading and writing
are artificial—but not necessarily in a bad sense. We need to remind ourselves the word _artificial_
derives from the word _art_ . To say reading and writing are forms of art that had to be invented and
need to be taught to children does not make reading and writing any less wonderful or important.
On the contrary, it makes these things more wonderful and precious, and it also emphasizes the
importance of your job as a teacher. There is no job more important than teaching young children
the magnificent, valuable, and highly unnatural arts of reading and writing.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT EASY**~~


The second idea noted earlier, that learning to read and write is easy, is also mistaken. Reading and
writing are complex behaviors, and they are more complex in English than in many other languages
because English has a fairly complicated spelling system. In Spanish, for example, the relationships
between letters and sounds are mostly one to one, meaning each sound is usually written with one
spelling, and each spelling unit is usually pronounced one way. This is not the case in English. In
order to read and write English with a high degree of accuracy, there is quite a lot that students need
to learn.


As a way of demonstrating the complexity involved in learning to read and write in English, suppose
we attempted to list all of the discrete bits of information a person needs to know in order to be able
to read and write in English. As a starting point, we might begin with the 26 letters and argue that
these are the 26 things one really needs to learn to read and write English. However, for each letter,
one eventually needs to learn not only the letter shape but also the letter name (in order to be able
to read abbreviations and initials). So that is 52 bits of information.


Foundational Skills 1


That is a good start, but we must not stop there. In English, all letters can be written in uppercase
and lowercase forms, and the uppercase forms are not always the same as the lowercase forms.
Compare B to b, D to d, H to h, R to r, Q to q. At least 16 uppercase letters have a slightly different
form than the matching lowercase letters. So we must raise our estimate of the complexity of the
English writing system to 68 bits of information.


We are not done yet. Students must also know the 44 sounds these letters stand for. That raises our
estimate of the complexity to 112.


If there were a simple one-to-one relationship between letters and sounds, that might be a fairly
good estimate of the complexity of the code. Unfortunately, the relationships between sounds and
letters in English are quite complicated. The 44 sounds of English can be spelled many different
ways. In our work on this program we have identified 150 spellings that are frequent enough to be
worth teaching in the early grades. That boosts our estimate of the complexity of the code to 262.


In addition, students need to learn to track from left to right, to blend sounds into words (when
reading), and segment words into sounds (when writing and spelling). They need to learn a handful
of symbols used in writing, including the period, comma, exclamation point, question mark,
quotation mark, and apostrophe. That raises our estimate of code complexity to about 270 bits
of information.


We could boost the estimate even higher by adding Tricky Words and unusual spellings or by
pointing out that there are many letters in English that can be pronounced different ways. We could
also point out that reading a word like _thin_ requires students to group the first two letters and attach
them to one sound, and reading a word like _cake_ requires students to scan ahead, see the ‘e’, and
realize it controls the pronunciation of the ‘a’ earlier.


Even without these additions it is clear that the English writing system is quite complicated.


~~**THE PROBLEM WITH WHOLE LANGUAGE**~~


On a conservative estimate, there are 270 bits of knowledge a person needs to be able to read and
write English. It is unwise to ask students to tackle all of this complexity at once and hope they will
figure it out. Yet that is precisely what is done in so-called “Whole Language” approaches. Whole
Language instruction is based on the assumption that learning to read is natural, and not difficult,
so reading skills can be allowed to develop gradually, without much explicit instruction. Lots of
students in Whole Language classrooms do manage to figure out the English writing system, but
many others do not. Whole Language ideas have tremendous emotional appeal, but the Whole
Language approach is actually a recipe for _leaving many children behind._ It is an especially risky
strategy for disadvantaged children.


Appendix A
**389**


**390**



A much better strategy is to introduce the English spelling code explicitly, beginning with the
easiest, least ambiguous, and most frequently used parts of the code and then adding complexity
gradually. That is the central strategy on which this program is based.


The strategy adopted in this program is the same strategy that successful coaches use when
teaching children a sport such as tennis. The successful coach does not ask students to learn
“Whole Tennis” and soak up the necessary skills all at once by trying to hit all different kinds of
shots the first day on the court. Instead, the successful coach teaches the student to hit a forehand
ground stroke and provides lots of practice hitting forehands. Then the coach moves on to teach
a backhand ground stroke, then a forehand volley, then a backhand volley, then a serve, then an
overhead smash, then a drop shot, etc. With each element taught, the student becomes a stronger
and more complete player. In the same way, this program begins by teaching the most common and
least ambiguous spellings for sounds and then moves on to introduce the more complex parts of the
writing system.


~~**KEY ASPECTS OF THE SKILLS STRAND**~~


Some key aspects of the Skills Strand are listed below.


 - This program teaches reading and writing in tandem, since they are inverse processes. English
writing involves making pictures of sounds; reading involves translating those pictures back into
sounds and blending the sounds to make words.


 - This program rejects the Whole Language notion that exposure to rich language and lots of
environmental print is sufficient to ensure mastery of the writing system.


 - This program explicitly teaches letter-sound correspondences as opposed to leaving students to
figure these out on their own or deduce them by analyzing familiar whole words (as in some forms of
“analytic” phonics).


 - This program focuses on sounds, or phonemes, as the primary organizing principle of the program,
rather than letters.


 - This program includes phonics instruction, but the instruction differs from the phonics usually taught
in the United States in that it begins with sounds and then attaches those sounds to spellings. In a
typical phonics lesson in the United States, the teacher writes the letter ‘m’ on the board and says,
“This is the letter ‘em’. It says /m/.” As a teacher using this program, you will be asked to present your
lessons in a different way. You will be asked to begin with the sound. At the beginning of the lesson
you will tell the class: “Today’s sound is /m/.” You will lead the class in some engaging oral language
exercises that will allow students to say and hear the sound /m/. Once students are familiar with the
sound, you will show them how to draw a “picture of the sound.” You will write the letter ‘m’ on the
board and explain that this is how we make a picture of the /m/ sound.


Foundational Skills 1


  - This program focuses consistently on the phoneme, or single sound, and not on larger units.
Students learn to read words that contain onsets, rimes, and consonant clusters, but they learn to
view and process these larger units as combinations of smaller phoneme-level units. Rimes like _–ick_
and initial clusters like _st–_ are not taught as units but as combinations.


  - This program uses a synthetic phonics approach that teaches students to read by blending through
the whole word; it does not teach multiple cueing strategies, use of pictures as a primary resource in
decoding, or part-word guessing.


  - This program begins by teaching the most common or least ambiguous spelling for a sound (the
basic code spelling); later it teaches spelling alternatives for sounds that can be spelled several
different ways. Thus, the system is kept simple at first, and complexity is added bit by bit as students
gain confidence and automatize their reading and writing skills.


  - This program includes words, phrases, and stories for students to read and activity pages for them to
complete that allow for focused, distributed practice working with the letter-sound correspondences
students have been taught.


  - This program does not require students to read words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have learned. In other words, all words students are asked to read as
part of the program are decodable, either because they are composed entirely of letter-sound
correspondences students have been taught or because they are Tricky Words that have been
taught. This means students have a chance to begin reading words and stories that are completely
decodable before tackling words and stories that are full of spelling alternatives.


  - This program does not require students to write words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have been taught. In other words, students are only asked to write words that
can be spelled (at least plausibly if not always correctly) using the code knowledge they have been
taught.


  - This program carefully controls the introduction of Tricky Words and words with ambiguous or rare
spellings in Kindergarten, preferring to have students learn to read and write with regular words that
can be blended and spelled in accordance with the letter-sound correspondences taught.


  - This program avoids letter names in the early lessons of Kindergarten, because what is important
for reading is not the letter name but the sound value the letter stands for. To read the word cat, it is
essential to know /k/ /a/ /t/, not “see aay tee.”


  - This program teaches lowercase letters first and introduces the uppercase letters later.


~~**THE BASIC AND ADVANCED CODE**~~


The program teaches the highly complex letter-sound correspondences of the English language
in an explicit and systematic manner in Kindergarten–Grade 2. Students are taught how the 26
letters (or graphemes) of the alphabet are used in various combinations to represent 44 sounds (or
phonemes). There are approximately 150 different spellings for these sounds.


Appendix A
**391**


**392**



Students are first taught the **Basic Code** for each of the 44 phonemes. The Basic Code spelling
for a sound is usually the most common, or the least ambiguous, spelling for a sound. By learning
these letter-sound correspondences first, students experience a high degree of predictability, and
therefore success, in decoding words with these spellings.


Basic Code spellings may be single letters, such as these spellings and sounds: ‘a’ > /a/, ‘e’ > /e/, ‘b’

- /b/, ‘m’ > /m/. Basic Code spellings may also include digraphs or two letters to represent a sound,
such as ‘ee’ > / ee/, ‘oy’ > /oi/, ‘ou’ > /ow/, ‘sh’ > /sh/, ‘th’ > /th/. Other Basic Code spellings include
separated digraphs, such as ‘a_e’ > /ae/, ‘o_e’ > /oe/.


In a **Basic Code Lesson**, students first learn to listen for and isolate a single sound and are then
taught the spelling for that sound. Typically in this type of lesson, the teacher introduces the sound
and conducts various oral language activities with the students to be certain that they can identify
the sound orally. The teacher then presents the spelling for that sound and models writing the
spelling, as well as sounding out simple one-syllable words that use the spelling. Additional reading
and writing practice opportunities for students then follow.


The **Advanced Code** consists of all other spelling alternatives (over 100) that may be used to
spell the 44 phonemes in English. Examples of alternative spellings include ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘ss’> /s/,
‘c’ > /s/, ‘g’ > /j/, ‘ay’ > /ae/, and ‘ey’ > /ee/. Some of these spelling alternatives occur relatively
frequently in the English language, while others are quite rare. See the provided charts for the Basic
and Advanced Code.


As each spelling alternative is taught, the frequency with which students may expect the spelling to
occur is communicated in several ways. A “power bar” on cards used to teach the spellings indicates
how frequent or infrequent a spelling is. A long power bar indicates that the spelling occurs
frequently, while a short bar designates a rarer spelling.


Foundational Skills 1


The long power bar on the card below indicates that the ‘a’ spelling is used frequently to spell /a/,
the short vowel sound:


The short power bar on this card signals that the ‘eigh’ spelling is used infrequently to spell /ae/:


Appendix A
**393**


Students are introduced to and practice the **Advanced Code** in two types of lessons, **Spelling**
**Alternative Lessons** and **Tricky Spelling Lessons** . Whereas Skills instruction in Kindergarten
focuses almost entirely on the Basic Code, much instructional time in Grades 1 and 2 is devoted
to teaching **Spelling Alternatives** . In a **Spelling Alternative Lesson**, the teacher first reviews
the Basic Code spelling that students have already learned for a particular sound. New words
with different spellings for the same sound are then introduced. Students are then often asked to
conduct word sorts as a way to reinforce the fact that the same sound may be spelled multiple ways.
In Grades 1 and 2, teachers are also encouraged to display Spelling Trees in the classroom as yet
another way to reinforce spelling alternatives. A given sound is listed on the tree trunk, with various
branches standing for different spellings. Leaves with words exemplifying a spelling are placed on
the appropriate branches.













**394**



**Tricky Spelling Lessons** are used to explicitly call students’ attention to a spelling that can be
pronounced and read more than one way. For example, ‘a’ can be pronounced as /a/ ( _cat_ ), /ae/ ( _paper_ ),
/o/ ( _father_ ), or / ə / ( _about_ ). It may be helpful to think of a tricky spelling as an instance in which several
sounds “vie” for the student to pronounce and read the spelling a different way.


Foundational Skills 1


In a **Tricky Spelling Lesson**, the teacher calls explicit attention to many examples of words in which
the same spelling is pronounced different ways. Students are taught to try each pronunciation that
they have learned for a spelling until they recognize a particular pronunciation as a familiar word that
makes sense in the context. Some **tricky spellings** are taught in Grade 1, with many more taught in
Grade 2.

~~**THE TRICKY WORD LESSON**~~


A final lesson type is the Tricky Word Lesson. The term _Tricky Word_ is used in this program to refer to
a word that does not “play by the rules” of spelling and/or pronunciation. Examples of Tricky Words
include _one_, _said_, _of_, _were_, and _have_ .


You can describe the trickiness of a Tricky Word like _said_ in two ways. If you think about it from a
spelling point of view, you might say that the word _said_ is tricky because the sound /e/ is not spelled
with an ‘e’, as you might expect it would be. On the other hand, if you think about it from a reading
point of view, you might say the word is tricky because the letters ‘ai’ are not pronounced /ae/, as
you might expect they would be. Either way you look at it, _said_ is a Tricky Word.


But notice that the word is not completely irregular, either. The first letter and the last letter are
pronounced exactly as you would expect. It is only the second and third letters, representing the
vowel sound, that are not sounded as you would expect. Or, if you prefer to look at things from the
speller’s perspective, you might say the first and last sound are spelled just as you would expect; it
is only the middle sound—the vowel sound—that is spelled irregularly. This is the case with many
Tricky Words: most of them have a regular part (or parts) and then a tricky part. More often than
not, you will find the tricky part involves the vowel sound and its spelling.


When you are asked to teach a Tricky Word, the guidelines in the Teacher Guide will generally prompt
you to begin by reminding students that not all words play by the rules and words that do not play
by the rules are called Tricky Words. Next, the Teacher Guide will generally suggest you write the
Tricky Word on the board. You may wish to ask a student to read the word as he or she thinks it
might be sounded (i.e., to blend according to the normal procedures). Alternatively, you can read the
Tricky Word that way yourself. Then you can point out how the word is actually pronounced. Once
you have established the actual pronunciation, you can point out and/or discuss what is regular and
what is irregular about the word. Most Tricky Words have at least some parts pronounced exactly the
way you would expect. For example, as noted above, the first and last letter in _said_ are pronounced
just as one would expect. After discussing the regular parts, you should then draw attention to the
tricky part (or parts) of the word, pointing out letters not pronounced as one might expect they
would be (e.g., the ‘ai’ in _said_ ). This is the part of the word that students just have to remember.


By drawing attention to the regular as well as the irregular parts of the word, you teach students
that Tricky Words are only partial exceptions to the normal rules of reading and writing. (They are
not so much irregular as they are a little less regular than most words.) There are some parts of the
word spelled just as you would expect and also pronounced just as you would expect. Then there are
some others that are not. There is a subtle but important difference between teaching Tricky Words
this way and teaching them as single entities that have to be memorized as wholes, as if every part
of the word were unpredictable.


Note that some Tricky Words are actually part of spelling patterns. For example, the words _he_, _she_,
_we_, _be_, and _me_, are taught as Tricky Words early on because it is hard to write stories without them.
However, once the ‘e’ spelling alternative for /ee/ is taught, these Tricky Words can be seen as part


Foundational Skills 1


of a larger pattern that includes words like _replay_ and _prefix_ . Other Tricky Words, such as _one_ and _of_,
remain tricky even when most of the spelling alternatives have been taught.


It is important to note that Tricky Words are not the same as sight words. The distinction is
discussed in the next few sections.


~~**SIGHT WORDS AND TRICKY WORDS**~~


One of the most common terms in the world of reading instruction is _sight word_ . Unfortunately, this
is also a rather ambiguous and potentially confusing term. Educators use the term _sight word_ in
two different senses. For some people, sight words are high-frequency words that students need to
encounter frequently and learn to decode rapidly and effortlessly. Other people use the term _sight_
_word_ in a more restrictive sense, to refer to words that cannot be sounded out using letter-sound
correspondences and may need to be taught as exceptions.


In this program, we distinguish between _Tricky Words_ and _sight words_ . We define these terms as
follows:


 - A _Tricky Word_, as noted in the previous section, is a word that does not play by the rules. It is a word
containing at least one part that cannot be read correctly via blending or cannot be spelled correctly
using the code knowledge taught so far.


 - A _sight word_ is a high-frequency word that we want students to see many, many times and learn to
read quickly.


The main difference here is that a Tricky Word always contains some irregular element, whereas a
sight word might or might not. The Venn diagram below shows the relationship between these two
categories, as understood within this program.









Appendix A
**399**


**400**



The words in the left circle are Tricky Words: each one contains at least one set of letters that is not
pronounced the way you would expect. Or, if you prefer to look at matters from a spelling point of
view, you could say each contains at least one sound that is not written as you would expect it to be.


The words in the right circle are sight words: they are all high-frequency words that students should
see frequently and eventually learn to recognize rapidly.


The shaded area in the middle shows that there is considerable overlap between the two categories
(which is probably why the two senses of _sight word_ are regularly confused). Some words qualify as
sight words because they are used a lot and also as Tricky Words because they are not pronounced
(or written) as you would expect. These are words that are both irregular (and therefore hard to read
and write, at least at first) and also very common (and therefore important for student success).
They are candidates for special instruction, and many of them are given special instruction in this
program. (See “The Tricky Word Lesson” previously.)


The area on the far left shows words that are tricky in the sense that they depart from the most
common spelling patterns. But these words do not qualify as sight words on most lists because they
are not especially common. Words of this sort are sprinkled throughout the language but do not
receive much attention because they are only used occasionally. Students can learn them as the
need arises in upper grades.


The area on the far right shows words that qualify as sight words because they are very common
and should be rapidly recognized but do not qualify as Tricky Words because they are completely
regular. All of them are pronounced and spelled exactly as you would expect. They can be sounded
out and set down on paper using basic letter-sound correspondences taught in Kindergarten.
Students need to see these words—and they will see most of them frequently in the materials—but
you probably do not need to give these words special attention, and you certainly should not ask
students to memorize them as wholes. Students can simply read them by sounding them out. After
sounding them out several times, they will begin to recognize them more rapidly. In other words, no
special teaching is required for these regular high-frequency words. All that is required is multiple
exposures, and students are likely to get multiple exposures since the words are so common.


~~**SIGHT WORDS**~~


The guidelines for teaching Tricky Words are outlined in the section above. As noted above, we use
the term _sight word_ in this program to refer to high-frequency words that we want students to see
many, many times and learn to recognize rapidly.


The program does place the initial emphasis on reading regular words. But that does not mean
high-frequency sight words are not being learned. In fact, as noted above, many sight words are
completely regular and become decodable as students learn letter-sound correspondences. This
means that the program is a very effective program for teaching sight words.


Foundational Skills 1


To illustrate this, consider one of the most widely used lists of sight words, Dr. Edward Fry’s “Instant
Word” list. Fry’s list is divided into groups of 100. For purposes of illustration, we will focus on the
first three lists of 100 words, 300 words in all. These are words that Fry recommends be mastered
in the first several grades of school. We found more than half of the Fry Instant Words become fully
decodable in Kindergarten, meaning they are either regular and can be sounded out using the lettersound correspondences taught, or they are Tricky Words explicitly taught in the program.


By the end of Unit 3, four of Fry’s Instant Words are 100% decodable: _at_, _did_, _got_, _it_ .


By the end of Unit 4, 16 Instant Words are 100% decodable: _can_, _an_, _and_, _not_, _in_, _on_, _man_, _him_, _had_,
_if_, _its_, _get_, _end_, _men_, _set_, _sit_ .


By the end of Unit 10 in Kindergarten, 129 high frequency words (41 Tricky Words, plus 88 decodable
words) from the Fry Instant Word List have been taught. Using the Dolch Sight Word List as criteria,
by the end of Unit 10, 116 high frequency words (42 Tricky Words, plus 74 decodable words) from the
Dolch List have been taught. Many of these Tricky Words are practiced and reviewed in Grade 1 Units
1 and 2.


~~**CUSTOMIZING AND ADAPTING THE PROGRAM**~~


This is a highly structured and sequenced program. We are unapologetic about that, as we believe
the structure and sequence will be very helpful to students as they work to learn the English spelling
code. However, this is not a scripted program in which teachers are required to read the manual and
give one of a handful of approved responses. We expect—indeed, we hope—teachers will tweak the
phrasing and come up with ways to customize, personalize, and adapt the instruction.


Our goal has been to put things in a logical order and provide all of the guidance and support
necessary for a new teacher, or a teacher new to this kind of phonics instruction.


At the same time we believe there is room for experienced and creative teachers to customize and
adapt the program. Indeed, some of the exercises included in this version of the program were
developed by teachers in our pilot programs!


Sometimes in the lessons we give exact phrasing that we suggest you use; more often, however, we
give indirect phrasing and/or encourage you to explain something using your own words. You should
feel free to make changes to the phrasing. For example, you may prefer to speak of “a picture of a
sound” or a “spelling.” Later in the year, you may want to teach the term “digraph,” or you may prefer
to refer to the letters in a digraph as a “letter team” or as “buddy letters.” There are many ways to
customize the program and the language while preserving the basic instructional principles and
sequence of instruction.


Appendix A
**401**


**402**



For presentation of words, you may write on a chalkboard, a whiteboard, chart paper, an overhead
projector, a document camera or the projection system of your choice. A projection system works
especially well for activity pages, since it allows the teacher to model the task exactly as the
students will be completing it. For the chaining exercises, you may use a pocket chart, a magnetic
board with magnetic letters, an overhead projector with letters cut from a transparency, or a smart
board. Many modifications of this sort can be made without adversely impacting the quality of
the instruction.


You should also always feel free to add additional activities and activity pages that are consistent
with the our philosophy of instruction. You should always feel free to respond to the teachable
moment, even if it leads you slightly off the path laid out in the Teacher Guide.


There are only a handful of things you should not do:


You should not skip a lesson in which new code knowledge is taught. If you are not able to teach
Lesson 12 on Monday, teach it on Tuesday. If you are not able to teach it on Tuesday, teach it on
Wednesday. Do not try to “catch up” by skipping ahead to Lesson 14. If you do, students will be
lacking important code knowledge, untaught spellings will begin to appear in their word lists and on
their activity pages, and the lessons will start to make less sense to them.


For the same reasons, you should not reorder the lessons. The program relies heavily on sequencing,
and instruction will be confused and less effective if the lessons are reordered.


~~**SMALL GROUP WORK**~~


Large parts of this program have been written for whole-group instruction, but the program can be
customized to allow for small-group instruction of various kinds. Since all students need to learn
that /t/ is spelled ‘t’, it is instructionally efficient to teach the Basic Code Lessons and other lessons
that introduce the letter-sound correspondences to the whole class. You will note that there are
Support and Challenge sidebars sprinkled throughout the lessons, as well as the Additional Support
activities at the end of each lesson, that will guide you in how to differentiate instruction for your
students, while still using the whole class approach described in the Basic Code Lessons.


However, since some students will learn the new information right away while others will need
more practice, you may wish to do small-group work to follow up the initial introduction of code
knowledge. You will note that many lessons do include suggestions for small groups; you should feel
free to adapt these and other lessons as best meets the needs of your students. We have seen this
program taught very effectively in small groups and in workstations students visit on rotation.


Foundational Skills 1


~~**ADJUSTING THE SPEED OF INSTRUCTION**~~


This sequence will work for most children. However, all children are different, and all classrooms are
different. Some classrooms may need more time to master particular concepts than others. The
program has been designed so the pace of instruction can be adjusted as needed.


The most important thing for you to know is that _you can pause at any point in the program_ .
If students are not learning the material, simply stop where you are and do additional work to
remediate or reteach as needed. All lessons contain some materials you can use if you pause.


In addition, at the end of each unit there is a “Pausing Point.” If the end-of-unit assessment or your
observations suggest some members of the class need additional time to master the concepts
taught in the unit, this is an especially good place to stop and provide additional practice and
review. The Teacher Guides include additional work at each Pausing Point. They will typically provide
enough for at least 3 days of additional work. The materials provided in the Pausing Point can be
used in various ways. Sometimes you may wish to have all students do the same activity or activity
page. Other times you may wish to work individually or in small groups with students who are
struggling with a particular concept.


To slow down instruction, you can pause either in the middle of a unit or at a Pausing Point. We do
not recommend that you attempt to speed up the sequence of instruction. The program lays out an
ambitious program of instruction.


The Grade 1 program of instruction should work well for a wide range of students. You should begin
with the assumption that the Grade 1 program is an appropriate option for all students in the class.


Inevitably, however, there will be differences in learning. Students learn at different rates. Some
students will pick up the material quickly, others will have more difficulty. There are many strategies
for dealing with this. In general, we encourage you to try to keep most of the class together as long
as it makes sense to do so. It is much easier to teach one set of students at roughly the same level
than it is to teach two or three groups at very different levels.


If you find some students are lagging, you may still be able to keep the class together for the main
lessons but find extra time two to four times a week to work with those students who seem to need
extra practice. The various chaining activities are especially good to do in these remedial groups.


If this is not sufficient, you may eventually need to regroup some students. As we note in Lessons
6–10 of this unit, it is especially important to administer the placement assessment to all students
at the start of the year. We strongly recommend that teachers then use an “across grade” approach
to grouping students. If there are two classrooms, these two teachers should look at all of the Grade
1 students in both classrooms and consider regrouping students for Skills instruction only, with one
teacher taking the class of students who need review and more practice, while the other teacher


Appendix A
**403**


**404**



works with those students ready to move on to Grade 1 Skills instruction. It will likely be worthwhile
to reconvene at multiple times during the year to plan across the grade level, using the end-of-unit
assessments. In this way, students in need of remediation can be moved to the appropriate group,
while students who are making progress can advance.

**Grade 2 | Foundational Skills 1**
Appendix C: Using
Chunking to Decode
Multisyllable Words


Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught will enable students to read onesyllable words with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences is no
guarantee that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllable words. To this
end, most students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk and read
parts of words—syllables—as a way to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can then
be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated and students are expected
to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, the program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the easiest
two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is already a
familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In addition, each
syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing_, _hunt·er_, _bust·ed_ ). The
dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain double-letter
spellings for consonants, in this program, the divider is typically placed after the double-letter
spelling rather than between the two consonants (e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers familiar
with other ways to chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is done, however,
because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single-spelling units since Kindergarten
(‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.). The program strives to be consistent in representing these
spellings in the way that the students have been taught to process them (e.g., as whole entities
for a sound). (Ultimately, as students become more proficient at decoding and chunking syllables
through subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually chunk and decode
these words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding these two-syllable
words consisting of root words and suffixes relatively easy.


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable words.


Foundational Skills 1


To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


  - **Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound (e.g.,**
**/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/):** _let,_ _pad,_ _rod,_ _tin,_ _fun,_ _pic·nic,_ _un·til_


  - **Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/,**
**/ie/, /oe/, /ue/):** _cake,_ _home,_ _like,_ _mule,_ _Pete, mis·take, stam·pede_


  - **Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint,_ _speak,_ _proud,_ _play, dis·may, be·low,_ _coun·sel_


  - **R-Controlled Syllables:** _art,_ _curb,_ _girl,_ _fort,_ _clerk,_ _tur·nip, ar·tist, fe·ver_


  - **Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /ie/,**
**/oe/, /ue/):** _go,_ _me,_ _hi,_ _a·pron, f·nal, com·pre·hend_


  - **Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple, puz·zle, raf·fe, ca·ble, ri·fe_


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


  - **Schwa Syllables:** _ben·e·fit, ap·pe·tite, a·bout, hos·pit·al,_ _e·mo·tion_


**Note:** The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately because
of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


**To be clear, in order to decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these**
**names. The names of the syllable types are provided here only to establish a common**
**vocabulary for teachers as they use the materials.** What is necessary, however, for students to
become fluent readers of longer words in increasingly complex text is that they be able to visually
parse certain spelling patterns as syllable chunks so they can quickly and easily decode each
syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in Kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


  - When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.


_ad · mit_ _nap · kin_ _trum · pet_


Appendix C
**411**


**412**




  - For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed after
the double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is because the
double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units since Kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’

   - /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).


_traff · ic_ _muff · in_ _happ · en_


  - When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.


_mon · ster_ _con · tract_ _pil · grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read the
first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model for
students how to blend the two syllables aloud:


In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the magic
‘E’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


  - Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for closed
syllables:


_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


In Grade 2, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to use
a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying each
possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


Foundational Skills 1


  - When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:


_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_


However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There is
no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be flexible
and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to determine
whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. In order to recognize
whether a word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has
heard before (i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent
an additional challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a
second language.


If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:


_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is fairly straightforward.


Appendix C
**413**


**414**




 - When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings in
the words


_ban · gle_ _twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_


In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings represent
the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a combination of stressed
and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed or weakly stressed, its
vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that linguists call a schwa.
This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’ and
‘tion’. Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite challenging for many
students.


Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the schwa
sound has a particular spelling:


_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is actually a schwa syllable, but it is identified
separately because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


 - Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables accordingly
throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _tri·cycle_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness_ _help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten—Grade
3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.
