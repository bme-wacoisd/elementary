**A Letter from Mr. Mowse**



_Dear Boys and Girls,_


_Greetings from your old friend, Mr. Mowse! I have really been enjoying_
_listening to you and your teacher reading and talking about the War of_
_1812. I am really learning a lot._


_I even learned that “The Star-Spangled Banner” is our national anthem!_
_But I still have some questions about our flag and the words to our_
_anthem. Maybe you can help me find the answers!_


_Your pal,_


_Mr. Mowse_



**Here are some of Mr. Mowse’s questions:**


1. What do the words of our national anthem describe?


2. When singing our national anthem, how should people behave?


3. How do people show respect for the flag?


4. How did the poem Francis Scott Key wrote become our national
anthem?


_____________________________________________________


1. What are the three times during the attack on Fort McHenry that
Key looked for the flag?


2. How could Key see the flag in the middle of the night?


3. Why couldn’t Key see the flag just before the sun came up?

the attack ended?

**Lesson 29: Topic and Concluding Sentences** **Digital Component 29.4**

###### One reason Americans were angry with the British in 1812 was that the British forced some American sailors to serve in the British Navy. The British were also stopping American ships from trading freely with the French. Another reason Americans were angry was that the British were trading with Native Americans. This created problems for American pioneers who were trying to move west.
