###### Introduction


~~**UNIT 7 OVERVIEW**~~


**Vowel Spellings**


In this unit, you will continue to teach the advanced code, but you will now turn from spelling
alternatives for consonant sounds to spelling alternatives for vowel sounds.


Vowel spellings are the trickiest part of the English spelling code. Most vowel sounds can be spelled
several different ways. This means that vowel sounds are hard to spell. For example, to spell the
sound /ae/, a student has to not only be able to hear the /ae/ sound but also select the correct
spelling from several alternatives.


It is no wonder that many students struggle to decode vowel spellings when reading—and struggle
even more mightily to spell vowel sounds when writing. The difficulty is embedded in the English
writing system. However, the orderly and systematic way in which the vowel spellings are introduced
in this unit and in later grades will help students cope with the complexity of English vowel spellings
and lead to significantly stronger reading and spelling skills.


The text that students will be reading and discussing provides opportunities for students to build
content knowledge and draw connections to social studies. You may build on class discussions to
support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strand of geography, history, and
culture from the social studies TEKS. This content is not a replacement for grade level social studies
instruction.


**Spelling Alternatives**


In this unit, the focus is on two of the so-called “long” vowel sounds, /ae/ and /oe/. Students will
review the basic code spelling for each sound and then learn common spelling alternatives:


  - /ae/ spelled ‘a_e’ (review), **‘ai’, ‘ay’ (new)**


  - /oe/ spelled ‘o_e’ (review), **‘oa’ (new)**


Only the most common alternatives are taught in Grade 1. Other spelling alternatives will be taught
in Grade 2.


In the past, you may have taught students the well-known jingle, “When two vowels go walking, the
first one does the talking.” You may be tempted to use that jingle here to explain why _way_ and _wait_
are pronounced with /ae/ and why _boat_ is pronounced with /oe/. However, it is preferred that you
avoid this saying. This rule is actually very unreliable. It is wrong almost as often as it is right. In
addition, the rule treats vowels as letters, like ‘a’ and ‘o’, when, in fact, vowels are sounds. Finally,
the walking-talking rule teaches students that they only need to pay attention to the first letter in
a digraph spelling. This can cause students to misread words such as _now, head_, and _cookie_ . For
digraphs, one has to keep in mind that both letters work together to stand for the vowel sound.


Introduction
**1**


Necessary resources for this unit include: Vowel Code Flip Book, Individual Code Charts, and
Spelling Cards. These resources will be used throughout the unit.


**Syllable Breaks**


In this unit, as in the last unit, the use of the syllable divider to separate two-syllable words into
smaller, more manageable chunks is discontinued. Please refer to the appendix at the end of
this Teacher Guide for further discussion of syllabification in English if students need ongoing
scaffolding.


**Tricky Words**


The following words are introduced as Tricky Words as they occur in the Reader: _Mexico_ (Lesson 5),
_talk_ (Lesson 7), _Hidalgo_ (Lesson 8), _gracias_ (Lesson 9), _Carlos_ (Lesson 10), and _Gomez_ (Lesson 12).


**Decodable Reader**


The Reader for this unit is called _Jay_ and _Martez_ . It focuses on a young boy, Jay, and his friendship
with a Mexican-American boy named Martez. In the second half of the Reader, Jay, Martez, and Jay’s
family go on a trip to Mexico. The stories incorporate Grade 1 history and geography topics from the
curriculum. Please note that there is not always a new story in each lesson.


Please read the stories before assigning them to students to determine any vocabulary that might
be unknown to students. Words or phrases such as _zip line_ are decodable, but may be challenging
for some students.


Note that there is no Big Book for this unit. If you feel that you need to demonstrate the stories to
students, you can use the images found on the program’s online materials for this Reader.


You should continue to observe student performance, monitoring as many individual students
or reading groups as possible. Each story is accompanied by a set of discussion questions in the
Teacher Guide. Please discuss these questions with students orally and encourage them to answer
in complete sentences. You will also find Story Questions activity pages that require a written
response in the Unit 7 Activity Book.


**Grammar**


The grammar lessons in this unit cover several topics: the use of conjunctions, commas, and nounverb agreement in sentences. You will discuss the conjunctions _and, but_, and _or_ and demonstrate
how they are used in writing. You will also introduce commas as punctuation marks that separate
items in a series.


**Spelling**


Weekly spelling lists and assessments continue in this unit. The spelling lists continue to be made up
of words with letter-sound correspondences that students have already been introduced to in reading.


Foundational Skills 7
**2**


Students will also create a Dictation Journal that focuses on spelling words in isolation as well as
in sentences. Spelling assessments will incorporate a phrase or sentence that students must spell
correctly.


  - For the dictation journal, you can either have students use a journal they use for other writing
activities or you may wish to create a small dictation journal for each student. Stapling five pieces of
paper together is all you will need for each journal. (1)


~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit, you will introduce students to instructional writing. As in other units of Grade 1, students
are taught a three-stage writing process. First students plan, then they draft, and then they edit. You
will be asked to draw attention to these steps again as students work on these kinds of writing.


Students will also practice opinion writing in this unit. Students will learn that, when writing
an opinion piece, they should state their opinion, give reasons for their opinion, and provide a
conclusion for their thoughts. Students will also be encouraged to include evidence from the text to
support their opinion.


**Left-Handed Handwriting Guidance**

  - Consider your seating arrangement for left-handed students. The placement of the arms and elbows
in relation to other students can impact their writing space.


  - Encourage your students to hold their writing tools correctly to reduce hand strain. Allow time for
students to develop their hand strength in writing.


  - Providing pencil grips for students could alleviate the strain on their hands when writing.


  - Orienting the paper at an angle can help left-handed students write more easily and comfortably.
Consider using paper with a raised line for students to rest their hands on as they write.


~~**UNIT 7 ASSESSMENTS**~~


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


In addition to the weekly spelling assessments, formative assessments are clearly marked for
monitoring individual student performance and progress in key skills throughout this unit. Quick
“Checks for Understanding” to evaluate classroom performance as a whole are also designated in
various lessons.


Careful attention to this information, collected on a daily basis, will enable teachers to quickly
determine which students may benefit from reteaching and/or more practice in particular skills,
using the Additional Support activities found at the end of each lesson.


Introduction

**Student Performance Assessment**


An End-of-Year Assessment for students using the program for Grade 1 is provided, starting
in Lesson 19. You should administer this year-end assessment even if students have not fully
completed all units of the Grade 1 program.


If time permits, it would be ideal to administer the entire assessment to all students in your class.
Administer the Silent Reading Comprehension Assessment to all students. The story used in the
Silent Reading Comprehension Assessment will be completely decodable for students who have
completed Unit 6. The assessment allows you to gauge students’ independent reading proficiency
and comprehension. It also allows you to do additional follow-up assessment for students who
may be struggling. You will ask all students in the class to read a story called “Shark and Wee Fish”
silently and to then answer a set of multiple-choice questions about the story.


The Fluency Assessment makes use of the same story, “Shark and Wee Fish,” for assessment of
reading accuracy and fluency. As you listen to individual students read the story aloud, you will
make a running record and take a measurement of fluency. This section should be administered to
all students who miss two or more of the seven questions on the Silent Reading Comprehension
Assessment.


The Word Reading in Isolation Assessment is a word-reading assessment designed to test students’
ability to read the specific spellings taught or reviewed in Grade 1. Ideally, you should administer
this assessment to all students. However, if time is limited, you may choose to administer this
assessment only to those students to whom you administered the Fluency Assessment, or to those
students in your classroom who are most at risk.


You are strongly encouraged to share the results of this assessment with all students’ Grade 2
teachers. A summary sheet ( **Activity Page 19.3** ) is provided that can be passed on to Grade 2
teachers with students’ assessment information.


~~**SMALL GROUP WORK**~~


In this unit, explicit instructions are given on how to integrate small-group work. Generally, exercises
for two groups are suggested, assuming that Group 1 consists of independent workers and Group 2
of students who need more support. Of course, you can subdivide your class further. Small-group
work is typically suggested during story reading time. You will have the choice to (1) have both
groups work on the same skill, with the independent group working on their own while the other
group receives guidance from you or (2) reteach/reinforce a skill that you feel needs to be practiced
more with Group 2. For reteaching/reinforcing skills, please use the Additional Support activities
from relevant lessons and the Pausing Point for additional exercises and activity pages. Please keep
in mind that you do not have to use the small-group configuration every time it is suggested and
that you can adapt other lessons so they contain small-group work.


Foundational Skills 7

~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice the Unit 7 skills can be found in
the Pausing Point section included after the last lesson if you need to provide targeted remediation
for individual or groups of students in any areas in which they performed poorly on the end-of-unit
assessment.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


In this section at the end of the Teacher’s Guide, you will find forms and charts which may be useful,
including the following:


  - Anecdotal Reading Record


  - Discussion Questions Observation Record


  - Spelling Alternatives Observation Record


  - Spelling Tree Templates


  - End-of-Year Assessment Materials


  - Additional Support Activity Pages


  - Activity Book Answer Key


~~**ADDITIONAL MATERIALS FOR UNIT 7**~~


Some additional materials are needed for specific lessons of Unit 7. These materials are always
listed in the Lesson at a Glance chart at the beginning of each lesson. For your convenience, a
complete list of additional materials is included here. The number in parentheses indicates the first
lesson in which the materials are used.


  - yellow, green, and brown paper for the Spelling Trees (1)


  - green markers, one per student (1)


  - unruled, white index cards (1)


  - red markers, one per student (3)


  - chart paper (14)


  - scissors and glue stick for each student (14)


  - two large sticky notes of two different colors for each student (17)


  - digital components: Throughout this unit and others, whenever the lesson suggests the teacher
model the completion of an activity page or prepare a chart to display, you may use the digital version
provided in the online materials for this unit. (2)

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


Today you will introduce two spelling alternatives for the /ae/ sound.
Students should already know the basic code spelling ‘a_e’ as in _cake_ .
In today’s lesson you will review this spelling and introduce the spelling
alternatives ‘ai’ as in _wait_ and ‘ay’ as in _day_ . The following chart shows
how common each spelling is.


  - Review the following spelling patterns:


    - **‘ai’** is generally used in initial position ( _aim, aid_ ) or medial position ( _pail,_
_paint_ ) and is almost always followed by a consonant spelling. It is rarely
used in final position. Notice how odd the pseudowords _hai_ and _pai_ look
when compared to the real words _aim, jail, raid_, and _sailor_ .


    - **‘ay’** is generally used in final position ( _say, pay_ ) and rarely found in initial
or medial positions. Notice how odd _mayl_ and _fayl_ look when compared to
_may, spray,_ and _player_ .


    - ‘ay’ is the only spelling taught here that regularly falls at the end of a word.


    - The spellings ‘ey’ ( _hey_ ), ‘ea’ ( _great_ ), and ‘eigh’ ( _eight_ ) are rare and will be
taught in Grade 2.


    - Make Dictation Journals for each student by “stapling five pieces of paper
together."


**Foundational Skills**

  - Prepare to display the Vowel Code Flip Book within view of all students;
also have the Spelling Cards listed in the Lesson at a Glance chart, student
Individual Code Charts, and green markers readily available.


Lesson 1 Spelling Alternatives: Introduce /ae/ > ‘ai’ and ‘ay’
**9**


- Create a Spelling Tree for the /ae/ vowel sound using the template provided
in Teacher Resources. You should make the final tree at least 18” x 24”, but
even larger would be preferable. Make the branch at the bottom the longest
and the branch at the top the smallest. Make two other branches, one slightly
longer than the other, in between.


- Label the trunk /ae/. Label the bottom branch ‘a_e’, the next branch ‘ai’,
and the third branch ‘ay’. Label the smallest branch at the top “odd ducks.”


- On green paper, make multiple copies of the leaf template found in Teacher
Resources. Write /ae/ words such as _cake, frame, game, pavement, take,_
_brain, chain, nails, wait, aim, day, play, stay, subway,_ and _portray_ on the leaves.


- On yellow paper, make multiple copies of the odd duck template found in
Teacher Resources. You do not need to write words in advance on the odd
ducks; just have these available during the lesson in the event a student
offers a word with the /ae/ sound that doesn’t fall into one of the other
spelling patterns.


- A completed Spelling Tree is shown here:







**10**




- Prepare the Spelling Alternatives Observation Record provided in Teacher
Resources. Over the course of the unit, be sure to ask each student to decode
words with ‘a_e’, ‘ai’, and ‘ay’ for /ae/ (beginning in Lesson 1) and ‘o_e’ and ‘oa’
for /oe/ (beginning in Lesson 11).


- Write the following on index cards or sentence strips to use for the Wiggle
Cards activity:

~~**SPELLING ALTERNATIVES FOR /AE/ (10 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iii**~~


**Vowel Code Flip Book Review**

  - Have students say the /ae/ sound several times, stretching it out.


  - Turn to the **Vowel Code Flip Book page 6** .


  - Point to the ‘a_e’ spelling, read the sample word ( _cake_ ), and discuss the
power bar.


  - Write ‘a_e’ on the board/chart paper, along with the sample word. _(cake)_


  - Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart page 2** .


  - Have them locate and trace the green outline of the card and the code
information for ‘a_e’ > /ae/ with a finger.


  - Tell students they will now learn two more spellings for the /ae/ sound.


  - Create and show students a Spelling Card for /ae/ > ‘ai’ ( _wait_ ). Discuss the
power bar and have a student read the example word. Attach the Spelling
Card to the appropriate place.


  - Have students outline the ‘ai’ vowel spelling in green marker in their
Individual Code Charts.


  - Follow the same procedure for the spelling ‘ay’ ( _day_ ).


  - Discuss the power bar and have a student read the example word. Attach the
Spelling Card to the appropriate place.


  - The spellings can be found on the following pages in the Vowel Code Flip
Book and in students’ Individual Code Charts.

**TEKS 1.2.B.iii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe
syllables; vowel teams, including vowel digraphs and diphthongs; and r-controlled syllables.


Foundational Skills 7


 - Tell students that whenever the spelling ‘ai’ or ‘ay’ appears on an activity page
or in a story for the next few lessons, it will be printed in bold type to remind
them that this is a spelling they learned recently.


Check for Understanding


Write the words _way, swam, stay, may, tail, map, clay, main, rain, ran, pain_ on the board/

chart paper and read them aloud, pointing to the individual sounds as you segment the

word. Ask students to raise their hand if the word has the /ae/ sound.


~~**SPELLING TREE FOR /AE/ (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Show students the Spelling Tree and explain that you are going to use it to
help them keep track of the spellings for the /ae/ sound.


 - Point to the trunk labeled /ae/.


 - Point to the four branches: ‘a_e’, ‘ai’, ‘ay’, and odd ducks. An odd duck is
something that is different or doesn’t fit in a group. Explain that the ‘a_e’
branch is the longest and on the bottom, the ‘ai’ branch is the second longest,
and the ‘ay’ branch is the third longest. Remind students that the smallest
branch (or the one with the least open space around it) is for odd ducks.


 - Shuffle the leaves and then show each leaf.


 - Ask a student to read the leaf and then place it on the correct branch of the
Spelling Tree.


Observation: Spelling Alternatives


Ask as many students as possible to read a word and place the leaf on the Spelling

Tree. Make note of their individual ability to decode words with ‘ai’ and ‘ay’ for /ae/

in the Spelling Alternatives Observation Record.


~~**WIGGLE CARDS (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Using the cards you prepared in advance, show students a Wiggle Card,
have them read it, and let them perform the action on the card.


 - Continue with the remaining cards.



Support


If the spelling
alternatives continue to
confuse students, draw
two different-looking
flowers (e.g., a tulip and a
daisy) on the board/chart
paper. Explain that, in the
same way that we can
draw different pictures
of a flower, we can
write different letters to
represent the /ae/ sound.

Nouns


  - Remind students that they have learned about a part of speech called a noun
that can be a person, place, or thing.


  - Say the phrase, “tall man.” Have students repeat the phrase, and ask them to
identify which word is a noun. _(man)_


  - Ask students if the noun _man_ names a person, place, or a thing.
_(a person)_


  - Remind students that there are also special kinds of nouns called proper nouns.
They are called proper because they name someone or something specific.


  - Tell students that you will say two nouns: _Jane_ and _girl_ . Ask students which
word refers to a specific person. _(Jane)_


  - Explain that _Jane_ is a proper noun because it names a specific person.


  - Explain to students that each person in the room has a proper noun for
their name.


  - Say a student’s name and ask that student to raise their hand. Point out that
not everyone has this name, so we know it refers to a specific person.


  - Then say the word _girl_ and ask all the girls in the class to raise their hands.


  - Point out that the word _girl_ refers to many students in the class, not just one.
Therefore, it is a common noun and not a proper noun.


  - Repeat this procedure with a boy’s name and the boys in the class.

Verbs


 - Remind students that a word which names an action is a part of speech
called a verb.


 - Actions are things you can do, like run and jump and read.


 - On the board/chart paper, write the sentence: _Spin the wheel_ .


 - Have students read the sentence, name the action, then pretend to perform
the action.

Note to Teacher


Today you will introduce students to noun-verb agreement. These are mainly
oral lessons, getting students to hear the correct noun-verb agreement. More
explicit instruction and practice for this topic will come in the later grades.


**Reading**

 - Give some thought in advance as to which students need the greatest support
in reading and place them in Group 1 to work with you in a small group. Group 2
students will read with partners.

Students will revise and expand oral sentences using the decodable conjunctions
_and_, _but_, _so_, and _or_ . ~~**TEKS 1.11.C**~~


Students will distinguish between singular and plural nouns and will match the
correct verb form with singular and plural nouns in oral sentences.


~~**TEKS 1.2.B.v; TEKS 1.11.D.i**~~


~~**WARM-UP (15 MIN.)**~~


**Sentences with Conjunctions**

  - Remind students that when they speak or write, they should strive to make
what they say or write interesting. Tell students that one way that they can do
this is by adding words called conjunctions to join phrases and sentences.


  - Conjunctions are words that connect phrases and sentences together.


  - Say, “My class went on a trip.” Point out that this is a sentence.


  - Ask students how they might expand this sentence and make it longer.


  - One way we can expand sentences and make them longer is to use
conjunctions to connect one sentence to another. Common conjunctions are
_and, but, or,_ and _so_ . Write _and, but, or,_ and _so_ on the board/chart paper.


  - Demonstrate aloud how to expand sentences using these conjunctions:
“My class went on a trip and it was fun. My class went on a trip, but it started
to rain.”


  - Ask students to provide other revised sentences aloud using the decodable
conjunctions _and, but, or,_ and _so_ . Point out that _and_ joins like phrases or
sentences, _but_ joins a phrase that changes the direction of the sentence,
_or_ offers choices, and _so_ indicates cause.


  - Work with students to expand sentences of their choosing.


**Note:** It is not critical that students be able to identify which words are
conjunctions but that they are able to use them to expand sentences.


**TEKS 1.11.C** Revise drafts by adding details in pictures or words; **TEKS 1.2.B.v** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge

Language


**Connecting Ideas**


**Beginning**
Provide students with
multiple choices and
ask them to choose an
appropriate conjunction:
“Martez likes hopscotch,
( _so/and/but)_ he does not
like coleslaw.”


**Intermediate**
Offer students word pairs
and ask them to use an
appropriate conjunction
to join them in a sentence:
“ _oranges_ - _apples”_ could
become “You can have
oranges _and_ apples.” or
“You can have oranges
_or_ apples.” or “You can
have oranges _but_ not
apples.” Discuss the
differences in sentence
meanings because of
the conjunctions.


**Advanced/Advanced High**
Offer students a series
of actions and ask them
to use conjunctions to
combine two or more of
them: “I saw a dog. He
looked friendly. I petted
him. He wagged his tail.”
could become “I saw
a dog _and_ he looked
friendly.” or “The dog
looked friendly _so_ I petted
him.” Encourage students
to use variation.


~~**ELPS 3.C**~~



Lesson 4 Grammar: Conjunctions and Noun-Verb Agreement
**39**


Support


Pay attention to students’
spoken language
throughout the day. If
students make errors in
noun-verb agreement
when speaking, gently
repeat what they said,
modeling correct nounverb agreement. Do not
require students to repeat
what you say.


**40**



Check for Understanding


Have students create an oral story using conjunctions to build on each other’s ideas.

Start the story with a statement. For example, if you say “I am going on a camping

trip and . . .,” the first student might say “I am packing my raincoat or . . .” The next

student might say ”I am bringing my umbrella but . . .” As students participate,

observe their ability to use conjunctions properly.


~~**NOUN-VERB AGREEMENT (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students they will now practice listening to the ways nouns and verbs
work together in a sentence.


 - On the board/chart paper, write the word _Jay_ and ask students, “Is _Jay_ a
singular or plural noun?” _(singular)_


 - Next to the word _Jay_, write both _jump_ and _jumps_ . Ask students, “Would we
say Jay _jump_ or Jay _jumps_ ?” Repeat the sentence choices aloud.


 - Tell students that since _Jay_ is a singular noun, we say “Jay jumps.”


 - Ask students to listen carefully. Tell them you will say two sentences, and
they should pick the one that sounds correct. Say: “The boys eat sandwiches.
The boys eats sandwiches.”


 - Tell students that since _boys_ is a plural noun, we say “The boys eat sandwiches.”


 - Ask a student to say another plural noun. Ask another student to say a verb.


 - Say the provided plural noun along with a correct and incorrect choice for the
verb, and ask students which verb sounds correct. For example, ask students
if you would say “The girl walk.” or “The girl walks.”


 - Ask students for two more plural noun examples following the same
procedure as before. Repeat for two singular noun examples.

Exit Pass: Noun-Verb Agreement


Write the following word pairs on the board/chart paper. Ask students to use

each word pair to create a sentence on a piece of paper. Point out that this time,

students must also adapt the verb to match the noun. Have students circle

student performance.

**Evidence for Martez’s Character**

 - Point students to the final question on the activity page: “Write about one
thing that Martez says because he is nice.”


**Page 8**


 - Tell students to skim page 8 and raise their hand if they find something that
Martez says or does that is an example of him being nice. _(Martez says,“I like_
_this corn a lot! You are a good cook!”)_

 - Have a student read the first paragraph on page 12 aloud. Then ask
students if there is anything in this paragraph that might be an example
of saying or doing something nice. (Prompt students to recognize that there
is not anything in this paragraph that would be considered an example of
being nice.)


 - Read the second paragraph on page 12 aloud. Now tell students to skim the
remainder of page 12 to find additional examples of Martez saying or doing
something nice and raise their hands to share. _(Answers may vary, but could_
_include that he ate all the food on his plate; he runs inside to thank Jay’s_
_mom and dad for dinner; or he asks if Jay can have dinner at his house the_
_next day.)_

You may want to explain
that when you say they
should skim the text, it
means they do not need
to reread every word, but
that they should look for
key points. If they want
to find something Martez

Foundational Skills 7


~~**READ “THE RED DISH” (25 MIN.)**~~


**Small Group**


**Group 1:** Meet with students needing more direct support. Listen as
students take turns reading “The Red Dish.” Have students practice their
fluently (rate, accuracy, and prosody) by independently, choral, or echo
reading the story.


Observation: Anecdotal Reading Record


As you listen to students read “The Red Dish,” make notes regarding their individual

reading ability in the Anecdotal Reading Record.


**Group 2:** Tell students to take turns reading “The Red Dish.” If they finish
early, they can combine two of the sentences on the board/chart paper with
a conjunction ( _and, or, but, so_ ) and illustrate their new sentence, or they may
reread a previous story in the Reader.

Reading


**Evaluating Language Choices**


Beginning
Read the sentence: “Jay
stuffs some in his mouth
and lets them melt.”
Explain that _them_ refers
to ice cubes. Tell students
_stuffs_ is an action word.
Read again, replacing
_stuffs_ with the word _put_ .
Demonstrate what each
verb implies by pretending
to stuff, and then put,
something in your mouth.


Intermediate
Read the sentence with
different action words
and ask students to
demonstrate the difference
between what each verb
implies by pretending
to stuff/put/place/pour
something into their
mouths.


Advanced/Advanced High
Ask students what the
action word _stuffs_ implies
and why the writer may have
chosen that specific word.


~~**ELPS 4.F**~~


Support


As students read “The Red
Dish,” point out that the
word _stuff_ is used both as
a noun and as a verb in this
story. On page 14, _stuff_ is
used as a noun (referring
to the food in the dishes)
and on page 18, _stuffs_ is
used as a verb (explaining
how Jay shoves ice into his
mouth quickly).



9. Martez hates
coleslaw.


10. Jay plays hopscotch.


11. Martez likes pork
chops.


12. Jay draws with
crayons.



1. Run in place.


2. Stand and clap.


3. Take a nap.


4. Eat your lunch.



5. Pet the dog.


6. Feed the fish.


7. Catch the train.


8. Ride a plane.



**Evidence for Martez’s Character**

 - Reconvene the whole class, and remind students that in the previous
lesson they looked at Martez’s character and found evidence that he has
good manners.


 - Ask students to list Martez’s actions and speech in this chapter. Select
students to share their response and write it on the board/chart paper.
In each case, ask whether or not this is what they would expect of
someone with good manners.


 - Ask students if they still think Martez has good manners, and provide
evidence from the text, such as when Martez explains the dishes to Jay,
notices he is in pain and brings him ice cubes, or compliments him on
joining the club.



Lesson 5 Review and Practice: Spelling Assessment
**53**


Challenge


Point students to the
phrase _Brave or perhaps_
_foolish_ . Ask students what
the conjunction _or_ means.
Discuss why eating the red
peppers might be brave or
foolish. Ask students if they
think it could be both,
and if so why.


**54**



Check for Understanding


Ask students for other adjectives they would use to describe Martez, and ask them

to provide evidence from the text or illustrations. (Answers will vary but should point

to the text and illustrations. For example, _cheerful_ because he smiles a lot or _nice_

because he helps Jay).


**Wrap-Up**





Observation: Discussion Questions


Call on a different student to answer each question. Note student performance in the

Discussion Questions Observation Record, noting whether the question answered

was literal, inferential, or evaluative, and whether the student answered in a complete

sentence and/or cited evidence from the text.

Students will revise and expand oral sentences using the decodable conjunctions
_and_, _but_, _or_, and _so_ . ~~**TEKS 1.11.B.i; TEKS 1.11.D.ix**~~


Students will add the inflectional endings – _ed_ and – _ing_ to root words and will
learn to double the final consonant in words with short vowel sounds when adding
inflectional endings. ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.v**~~


~~**BUILDING SENTENCES WITH CONJUNCTIONS (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that when they speak or write, they should strive to make
their speaking or writing interesting. Remind students that one way they can
do this is by adding words called conjunctions to join phrases and sentences.


  - Conjunctions are tiny words that connect phrases and sentences together.


  - Tell students that this is an example of a sentence: “My mom drinks coffee.”


  - Ask students how they might expand this sentence and make it longer.


  - Explain that one way to expand sentences and make them longer is to use
conjunctions to connect one sentence to another. Common conjunctions are
_and, but,_ _so_, and _or_ .


  - Write _and, but, so_, and _or_ on the board/chart paper.


  - Demonstrate aloud how to expand sentences using each of the targeted
conjunctions: “My mom drinks coffee and munches on a muffin. My mom
drinks coffee, but not at night. My mom puts sugar in her coffee so it tastes
sweeter. My mom drinks coffee or sips tea in the morning.”


  - Ask students to create other revised sentences aloud using the conjunctions
_and, but,_ _so_, and _or_ . Note to students that the conjunction _and_ joins like
phrases or sentences, the conjunction _but_ joins a phrase that changes the
direction of the sentence, _so_ indicates cause, and _or_ offers choices.


  - Work with students to expand sentences of their choosing.

sentences combine like
things, offer choices,
indicate cause, or change
direction to select an
appropriate conjunction.
Model writing the new

to copy your example.


Intermediate
Provide students with
multiple choices and
ask them to choose the
appropriate conjunction:
“The peppers in the red

**78**



Check for Understanding


Have students create an oral story using conjunctions to build on each other’s ideas.

Start the story with a statement. For example, if you say, “I am going on a camping

trip and . . .,” the first student might say, “I am packing my raincoat or . . .” The next

student might say, ”I am bringing my umbrella but . . .” As students participate,

observe their ability to use conjunctions properly.


~~**ROOT WORDS AND ENDINGS –ED, –ING (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Using the illustration of the flower you prepared in advance, review with
students that the base of a word is called the root word.


) **Digital Component 8.1**


 - Remind them that you can add a suffix to the end of a root word to make a
different form of the word.


 - Point out that sometimes, when you add a suffix to a one-syllable root word,
you need to double the consonant before adding the suffix. Explain that
this is the case with root words that have a short vowel sound and end in a
single consonant.


 - Write the word _stop_ on the board/chart paper and underline it. Ask a student
to use the word in a sentence.


 - Ask students how many syllables are in the root word _stop_ . You may clap to
show it is one syllable. Next, ask students whether _stop_ has a short vowel
sound. Circle the ‘o’ and say the /o/ sound to show it is a short vowel sound.
Ask if _stop_ ends in a single consonant.


Foundational Skills 7


 - Tell students that because _stop_ is a one-syllable word with a short vowel
sound and a single consonant ending, the final consonant is doubled when
adding a suffix.


 - Write the word _stopped_ on the board/chart paper and underline _stop_ in the
word. Point out that the word _stopped_ is in past tense. Ask a student to use
_stopped_ in a sentence.


 - Explain that _stop_ is the main part of the word (the root) and that the past
tense marker _–ed_ changed the tense of the verb.


 - Write the word _stopping_ on the board/chart paper, underlining _stop_ . Follow
the same procedure as above.


 - Write the word _peep_ on the board/chart paper. Using the same steps as you
used with _stop_, tell students that because _peep_ has a long vowel sound, the
ending consonant is not doubled when adding a suffix.


 - Write _peeping_ on the board/chart paper to demonstrate that the consonant is
not doubled.


 - Repeat the process with the words _tag, tagged_, and _tagging_, writing the
words below _stop, stopped_, and _stopping_ . Ask students if they see a pattern.


 - If students do not see the pattern, underline the doubled consonants and
explain that the final consonant spelling in the root word was doubled when
an ending was added.


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 8.1 and complete it with a partner.


Activity Page 8.1: Root Words and Endings –ed and –ing

the south of the United States. People from Mexico are called Mexicans.


 - Ask students to recall what they know about the Fourth of July, the
United States Independence Day. (This is the day we celebrate gaining
our independence, or freedom, from Britain.) Based on your background
knowledge, what can you predict “Mexican Independence Day” is? _Pause_
_for students’ responses._ Let’s read to find out more information about this
holiday.

 - Ask students to share responses to the final question on Activity Page 8.2
(“Who was Hidalgo?”).


 - Now ask students to refer back to the text, as well as using the shared
answers for the last question on Activity Page 8.2, to retell this
story, specifically identifying why there is a holiday on September 16th.
Scaffold students’ responses by asking:


   - Before Hidalgo, who was in charge of Mexico?


   - Why did the Mexicans want to be free from the Spanish?


   - What did Hidalgo do first?


   - What happened next, even though it took a long time?


   - Why do Mexicans celebrate September 16th as a holiday?


 - On the board/chart paper, write student points as key details. In each case,
help students understand that you have picked key words and phrases,
rather than copying the whole story:






 - Ask students to work with a partner and to take turns orally retelling the
story.


 - Encourage students to use words like _before_, _after_, _first_, _next_, and _finally_, as
appropriate in their retelling. Circulate among students, providing support
as needed.

  - Have students read the word on the card and tell them that all of these words
are called root words. Explain that when you add a suffix to the end of a root
word, it makes a different form of the word.


  - Ask students what suffixes they have learned about ( _–ed, –ing_ ).
Remind students if necessary.


  - Ask students if they remember when to double the consonant at the end of
a root word before adding the suffix. (Support students in identifying that
when adding a suffix to a root word that is one syllable, has a short-vowel
sound, and ends in a single consonant, you double the consonant at the end
of the root word before adding the suffix.) Point out that a root word must
meet all three of these criteria to get a double letter when you add a suffix:
that is, the root word must be one syllable, it must have a short vowel sound,
and it must end in a single consonant.


  - Tell students that they are going to practice adding suffixes to root words to
make a different form of the word.

 - Have students take turns reading the words on their cards again.
Write each word on the board/chart paper (e.g., _fish_ ).


 - For each word, ask students how many syllables are in the root word. _(one)_
You may clap to help show that it is one syllable.


 - Next, ask students whether the root word has a short vowel sound.
Circle the ‘i’ and say the /i/ sound to show it is a short vowel sound.


 - Last, ask students if _fish_ ends in a single consonant. Tell students that _fish_
is a one-syllable word with a short vowel sound, but it does not have a single
consonant ending. Circle the /sh/ at the end of the word. Therefore, you
would not have a double letter consonant before adding a suffix.


 - Add the suffix _–ed_ to the word on the board/chart paper to make _fished_
and underline _fish_ in the word.


 - Ask students to use the new word in a sentence.


**Phonics Flowers**

 - Make a copy of **Activity Page TR 8.1** for each student. Cut apart the
two flower templates and give each student one half of an activity page.


 - Next give each student an index card from the previous activity.

 - Remind students that each word is a root word. Have students write
the root word on the line at the base of the flower on the activity page.


 - On the lines near the petals, have students write the word with the
inflectional endings – _ed_ and – _ing._ (Remind students to double the
end consonant when appropriate.)

~~**TRICKY WORD STORY (15 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.vi**~~


  - Show students the index cards you prepared in advance, one at a time, and
have them read the Tricky Words aloud.


  - Give at least one index card to each student.


  - Tell students they are going to make up a silly story as a class. Each
student will say one sentence that adds to the story, using the Tricky Word
they receive.


  - To get students started, choose one of the Tricky Words and make a
starting sentence for the story (e.g., “Once there was a dragon.”).


  - Choose a student to give the next sentence. Make sure the sentence includes
their Tricky Word. Then choose another student to add the next sentence to
the story, using their Tricky Word.


  - Continue this process until all students have had a turn.


  - If time allows, collect the index cards, shuffle them, and redistribute them
to students to start a new story. You can also replace some of the cards with
other cards you did not use for the first story.

Students will read sentences that are missing end punctuation; will determine the
appropriate punctuation mark (period, question mark, or exclamation point); and
will capitalize words at the beginning of sentences. ~~**TEKS 1.11.D.viii; TEKS 1.11.D.ix**~~


Students will read sentences containing a series of words and will separate the
words in the series with commas. ~~**TEKS 1.11.B.i**~~


~~**PUNCTUATION REVIEW (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that they have learned several punctuation marks that are
used at the end of sentences.


  - Read the first sentence you prepared in advance, then ask students what is
missing from this sentence. _(a period)_


  - Write a period at the end of the sentence.


  - Remind students that a period is used at the end of a sentence that makes a
statement (or tells us something). When the students see a period at the end
of a sentence, they need to pause and take a breath.


  - Read the second sentence you prepared in advance, then ask students what
is missing from this sentence. _(a question mark)_


  - Write a question mark at the end of the sentence.


  - Read the third sentence with an excited expression, then ask students what
is missing from this sentence. _(an exclamation point)_


  - Write an exclamation point at the end of the sentence.


  - Remind students that an exclamation point is used at the end of a sentence
that expresses excitement. When students see an exclamation point at the
end of a sentence, they should read the sentence with excitement.


  - Explain that if we did not have these punctuation marks, all the
sentences would run together and we would probably not be able
to read them correctly.


**TEKS 1.11.D** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including (viii) capitalization for the beginning of sentences and
the pronoun “I”; (ix) punctuation marks at the end of declarative, exclamatory, and interrogative sentences; **TEKS 1.11.B.i**

- Read the fourth sentence you prepared in advance and have students read
it aloud.


- Ask students how many sentences these words represent. Then ask students
what is wrong with the way the words are written. _(There is no capitalization_
_or punctuation.)_


- Have students tell you what words to capitalize and where to add
punctuation so the two sentences are written correctly. Make the
changes on the board/chart paper.


- Have students read the two sentences, making sure that they pause at
the period.


- Tell students that sometimes pauses are needed within sentences, not just at
the end. This type of pause is indicated with another punctuation mark they
have learned—a comma. Draw a comma on the board/chart paper.


- Read the next sentence and have students read it aloud.


- Ask students to read the series of items in that sentence. _(grapes, ham,_
_and chips)_


- Remind students that commas are also used to separate three or more items
in a series.


- Put commas in the correct places as you read the sentence again, pointing
out that there is a comma directly after each item but that there is no comma
after the word _and_ .


- Repeat this process with the remaining sentences.

 - Review with students the various parts of the book, calling attention to the
cover, title, and the table of contents. Direct students to characteristics in the
text, such as the first and last letters in a word, punctation in a sentence, and
dialogue.


 - As a formative assessment, have students read a portion of the text
independently and then answer questions with a partner.


Observation: Anecdotal Reading Record


Circulate to listen to as many partner pairs as possible. As you listen to each student

read “Better than the Best,” make notes regarding their individual reading ability in

the Anecdotal Reading Record. Assess whether students know how to find the cover

of the book, back of the book, the table of contents, title, where the story begins, and

the page numbers, and glossary. In the text, have students identify the first and last

letters in a word, punctuation in a sentence, and dialogue.



Beginning
Use yes/no questions to
help students identify
textual clues: “Did Jay
frown?” “Does Jay hug the
card?” “Did he say, ‘Yippee!’
and ‘I can’t wait!’?”

board/chart paper:


Jay hugs the card and shouts, “Martez is the best!”


 - Underline the words _hugs_, _shouts_, and the statement “Martez is the best!”


 - Tell students each of these is a clue about Jay’s feelings. Discuss each
word/phrase (e.g., Why would you hug a card? What does that tell us
about Jay’s feelings?).


 - Tell students that in this sentence, we are not told how Jay feels. It does
not say, “Jay felt happy,” but we are still given words and phrases (and
punctuation) as clues that allow us to figure out how Jay feels.


 - Now, ask students to refer back to the Reader. Read the fourth paragraph
on page 34 aloud. Ask students to read along with you.


Jay’s jaw drops. “If Martez is on the trip, that would be better than the best!” he says.

Lesson 11 Spelling Alternatives: Introduce /oe/ > ‘oa’
**107**


**108**



~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


Review the following spelling patterns:


 - ‘o’ is rare in one-syllable words (some exceptions include _no, so, go_,
and _most_ )


 - At the beginning of a word, ‘o’ and ‘oa’ are the most likely spellings ( _old, obey,_
_oak_, and _oat_ ); ‘ow’ is rarely used in that position ( _own_ ).


 - In the middle of a word, with consonant spellings on either side, ‘o’, ‘oa’, and
‘o_e’ are all used ( _fold, groan_, and _hope_ ); ‘ow’ is rare ( _grown_ ); and ‘oe’ is
rarely, if ever, used.


 - At the end of a word, ‘o’, ‘ow’, and ‘oe’ are all used ( _hippo, snow_, and _toe_ ); ‘oa’
is very rare ( _cocoa_ ).


 - Many ‘o_e’ words change to ‘o’ when a suffix is added (e.g., _hope_ - _hoping_
and _joke_  - _joking, joker_ ).


**Foundational Skills**

 - Prepare to display the Vowel Code Flip Book within view of all students;
also have the Spelling Cards listed in the Lesson at a Glance chart, student
Individual Code Charts, and green markers readily available.


 - Create a Spelling Tree for the /oe/ sound using the template provided in
Teacher Resources. You should make the tree at least 18” x 24”, but even
larger would be preferable. Make the branch at the bottom the longest and
the branch at the top the smallest. Make one other branch in between.


 - Label the trunk /oe/. Label the bottom branch ‘o_e’, the middle branch ‘oa’,
and the top branch ‘odd ducks’.


 - On green paper, make multiple copies of the leaf template found in Teacher
Resources. Write /oe/ words such as _home, rope, note, quote, coat, float,_
_coach, soap, boat,_ and _toast_ on the leaves.


Foundational Skills 7


- On yellow paper, make multiple copies of the odd duck template. You do not
need to write words in advance on the odd ducks; just have these available
during the lesson in the event a student offers a word with the /oe/ sound
that doesn’t fall into one of the other spelling patterns.


- A completed tree is shown here:







**Reading**

  - Plan to read with students who were in Group 2 during the previous lesson.


**Universal Access**

  - Bring in a mirror for students to observe their articulation of sounds.


  - Gather pictures for depictable words listed on the Spelling Tree.
Give prior thought to any words that can be demonstrated with actions.

Have students look at
themselves in a mirror
to see what their mouth
looks like when they make
the sound. Have them
compare this to the shape
their mouth makes when
they make the /o/ sound.
If mirrors are not available,
have student pairs face
each other, first making
the /oe/ sound, then /o/.


~~**ELPS 1.B; ELPS 2.A;**~~

**Primary Focus:** Students will decode words with /oe/ > ‘o_e’ and ‘oa’ and will sort
different words based on their spelling features. ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iii**~~


~~**SPELLING ALTERNATIVES FOR /OE/ (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Have students say the /oe/ sound several times, stretching it out.


  - Turn to the **Vowel Code Flip Book page 9** .


  - Point to the ‘o_e’ spelling, read the sample word ( _home_ ), and discuss the
power bar.


  - Write ‘o_e’ on the board/chart paper, along with the sample word. ( _home_ )


  - Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart page 3** .


  - Have them locate and trace the green outline of the card and the code
information for ‘o_e’ > /oe/ with a finger.


  - Tell students they will now learn another spelling for the /oe/ sound.


  - Show students the Spelling Card for ‘oa’ ( _boat_ ). Discuss the power bar
and have a student read the example word. Attach the Spelling Card to the
appropriate place.


  - Have students outline the ‘oa’ vowel spelling in green marker in their
Individual Code Charts.


  - The spellings can be found on the following pages in the Vowel Code Flip
Book and in the student Individual Code Chart.






|Vowel Code Flip Book|Individual Code Chart|
|---|---|
|1.<br>‘o_e’ > /oe/ (_home_)** page 9**<br>2.<br>‘oa’ > /oe/ (_boat_) **page 9**|1.<br>‘o_e’ > /oe/ (_home_) **page 3**<br>2.<br>‘oa’ > /oe/ (_boat_) **page 3**|




  - Tell students that whenever the spelling ‘oa’ appears on an activity page or in
a story for the next few lessons, it will be printed in bold type to remind them
that this is a spelling they learned recently.


**TEKS 1.2.B.iii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe
syllables; vowel teams, including vowel digraphs and diphthongs; and r-controlled syllables.


Foundational Skills 7


Check for Understanding


Write the words _toad_, _coast_, _hop_, _roast_, _home_, _road_, and _cost_ on the board/chart paper

and read them aloud, pointing to the individual sounds as you segment the word.

Ask students to raise their hand if the word has the /oe/ sound.


~~**SPELLING TREE FOR /OE/ (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Show students the Spelling Tree and explain that you are going to use it to
help them keep track of the spellings for the /oe/ sound.


  - Point to the trunk labeled /oe/.


  - Point to the three branches: ‘o_e’, ‘oa’, and odd ducks. Explain that the ‘o_e’
branch is the longest and on the bottom and the ‘oa’ branch is in the middle.
It is shorter because this sound/spelling is less frequent. Remind students
that the smallest branch (or the one with the least open space around it) is
for odd ducks.


  - Shuffle the leaves and then show each leaf.


  - Ask a student to read the leaf and then place it on the correct branch of the
Spelling Tree.


Observation: Spelling Alternatives


Ask as many students as possible to read a word and place the leaf on the Spelling

Tree. Make note of their individual ability to decode words with ‘o_e’ and ‘oa’ for
/ oe/ in the Spelling Alternatives Observation Record.

~~**USE CONJUNCTIONS IN SENTENCES (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that when they speak or write, they should strive to make
their speaking or writing interesting. Remind students that one way they can
do this is by adding words called _conjunctions_ to join phrases and sentences.


  - Conjunctions are tiny words that connect phrases and sentences.


  - Say, “Jay can take a cab.” Point out that _Jay can take a cab._ is a sentence.


  - Ask students how they might expand this sentence and make it more
interesting.


  - One way we can expand sentences and make them longer is to use tiny
words called conjunctions to connect one sentence to another. Common
conjunctions are _and, but, so_, and _or_ . Write _and, but, so_, and _or_ on the
board/chart paper.


  - Demonstrate aloud how to expand sentences using each of the above
conjunctions. For example, you could say, “Jay can take a cab and get to the
airport in a flash. Jay can take a cab or wait for the bus. Jay takes a cab so he
can get to the airport. Jay can take a cab, but there is a traffic jam.”


  - Ask students to create other sentences aloud using the conjunctions _and,_
_but, so_, and _or_ . Note that _and_ joins like phrases or sentences, _but_ joins a
phrase that changes the direction of the sentence, _so_ indicates cause,
and _or_ offers choices.


  - Work with students to expand sentences of their choosing.

**Primary Focus:** Students will spell words with vowel teams, VCe syllables, and
r-controlled syllables. ~~**TEKS 1.2.C.i**~~


~~**SPELLING PRACTICE (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Explain to students that they are going to practice spelling words with vowel
teams, VCe syllables, and r-controlled syllables along with some of the words
from this week’s spelling list.


  - Say, “R-controlled vowel sounds are made by combining a vowel and the
letter _r._ In the _ir_, _er_, and _ur_ combinations, the _r_ changes the vowel so it makes
the /er/ sound. In _bird,_ the _ir_ makes the /er/ sound. I also see the single
consonant _b_ and the single consonant _d._ Say this word with me: /b/ /er/
/d/.”


  - Say, “Vowel digraphs are two vowels that make one vowel sound, such as the
long _o_ spelled ‘oa’ in _boat._ In _eat,_ I see the vowel digraph ‘ea,’ which makes the
/ee/ sound. I also see the single consonant _t._ Say this word with me: /ee/ /t/.”


  - Say, “I see the pattern vowel-consonant-silent _e_ in _lake._ This pattern creates a
long vowel sound. Say this word with me: /l/ /ay/ /k/.”


  - Read aloud the words from the box below. Have students use their Dictation
Journal to spell the words












  - Point out that their spelling words (not including the Tricky Word) are
included in the list. After they write the words, have them circle vowel teams
( _ai, oa, ay, ea, ou_ ), underline r-controlled vowels ( _er, ur, or, ir, ar_ ), and draw a
box around words with VCe syllables ( _airplane, cake, classmate, side, stone_ ).
Circulate to offer corrective feedback as needed. **Note:** You may need to
point out that some words, such as _railway, layer, airplane, brainstorm,_ and
_playground_ contain more than one pattern.

writing by listening to example instructions for drawing two pictures, and by
identifying which examples are clear instructions. ~~**TEKS 1.1.B**~~


~~**INTRODUCE INSTRUCTIONAL WRITING (25 MIN.)**~~


**Example 1: Drawing a Picture**

  - Tell students that in today’s lesson, and in the next several lessons,
they will work on creating and writing instructions.


  - Ask students what instructions are and what they might be used for.
_(a set of steps that tell you how to do or make something)_


**TEKS 1.1.B** Follow, restate, and give oral instructions that involve a short, related sequence of actions.


Foundational Skills 7


 - Explain that you will read a set of instructions that you will follow on the
board/chart paper.


 - Read aloud the instructions from the box, then complete each step of the
instructions as you read them.


**Note:** This first set of instructions is deliberately confusing. You may want to
exaggerate your confusion by interpreting each step literally to help illustrate
the point.



Challenge


Ask a student to execute
the instructions as you
read them aloud.






 - Ask students to guess what the picture is supposed to be. (It should not be
recognizable as a house at this point.)


**Revised Instructions**

 - Explain that you will read new instructions for the same process and will
follow these instructions on the board/chart paper.


 - Read aloud the instructions from the next box. Complete each step of the
instructions, or ask a student to do so, as you read them. Be sure to read the
title “Drawing a House” aloud, as well as the number preceding each step.









Lesson 13 Writing: Introduce Instructional Writing
**131**


 - Ask students which set of instructions was more helpful for drawing a house
and why. ( _The steps in the revised instructions had a title, were complete and_
_clear, and they were given in a logical order and numbered_ .)


 - Emphasize that a very important part in writing instructions is to make sure
that the steps are complete, clear, and in logical order.


 - Discuss what happens if the steps in a set of instructions are not complete or
in a logical order.


**Example 2: Drawing a Picture**

 - Distribute blank paper and tell students to take out a pencil.


 - Explain that you are going to read a set of instructions for a different process,
and this time you want everyone to follow the instructions on a piece
of paper.


 - Read the instructions from the box. Have students complete each step of
the instructions as you read.


**Note:** This first set of instructions is deliberately confusing. Do not read
the title aloud. Also, do not introduce the steps with numbers.







**132**




- After you have read the instructions, have students hold up their pictures
and tell them to look around the room to see if the pictures look the same.
(They probably will not look the same at this point.)


- Ask students to guess what the picture is supposed to be. (It may or may
not be recognizable as a smiley face at this point.)


- Ask students why their pictures look different from one another.
_(The instructions were not very clear or detailed.)_


Foundational Skills 7


**Revised Instructions**

 - Explain that you will read new instructions for the same process and that
you want students to turn over their papers and follow the instructions.


 - Read the instructions from the next box. Have students complete each step
of the instructions as you are reading them. This time you should read the
title “Drawing a Smiley Face” aloud, as well as the number preceding each
step. (You may introduce the steps with numbers or with the words _first_,
_second_, etc.)






- After you have read the instructions, have students hold up their pictures
and tell them to look around the room to see if the pictures look the same.
(Now the pictures should look very similar.)


- Ask students why the pictures now look very similar. _(The instructions were_
_clear and were given in logical order so that all students had a good idea of_
_what they needed to draw_ . _)_


- Ask students which set of instructions was more helpful for drawing a smiley
face and why. _(The steps in the revised instructions had a title, were complete_
_and clear, and they were given in a logical order and numbered_ . _)_


- Discuss what happens if the steps in a set of instructions are not complete or
in a logical order.


- Summarize by explaining that good instructions have several characteristics:


1. The instructions have a title.


2. The steps are numbered in a logical order.


3. All steps are complete.

  - Today the whole class is going to work together to come up with instructions
for something they do all the time—washing their hands.


  - Remind students that good instructions include a title that tells what
the instructions are about. Tell students the title of these instructions is
“Washing Hands.”


  - Remind students that good instructions also usually include a starting
sentence that summarizes what the instructions are about.


  - Tell them an example of a good starting sentence for these instructions:
“These steps tell you how to wash your hands.”


  - Ask one student to come to the front of the class and act out how to wash
their hands. Tell the student just to pantomime, not to talk.


  - Ask the student to act out one step at a time. As soon as the student finishes
a single step or action, ask them to stop. Then say, “So the first step in hand
washing is . . .” and describe what the student did.

restate students’ verbalizations so they are clear and accurate, including
words and phrases like “step 2 . . .” or “the second step . . .”


 - Continue in this manner until the remaining hand-washing steps have
been pantomimed and described.


 - Remind students that good instructions also usually include a result
sentence that states the outcome of the instructions if the steps are
followed correctly.


 - Ask students to think about why people wash their hands. Ask them,
“What do we want to end up with when we finish?” _(clean hands)_


 - Tell them a good example of a result sentence for these instructions:
“If you do all the steps, you will have clean hands.”


 - Summarize by saying that they worked together to create good instructions
for washing hands. The instructions had a title, a starting sentence, complete
and clear steps that were given in the correct order, and a result sentence.


**Example 2: Students Give Instructions**

 - Choose two students and ask the second student to leave the room for a
few minutes.


 - While the student is outside, explain to the first student and the rest of the
class that they will work on giving good spoken instructions.


 - Show a simple picture (e.g., a flower) to the class. Explain that you want the
first student to give the second student instructions for drawing the flower
when the second student is back in the room.


 - Quickly review the characteristics of good instructions: title, starting
sentence, numbered steps in a logical order, and a result sentence.


 - Give the picture of the flower to the first student. Remind them not to show
this picture to the second student.


 - Call the second student back into the room and explain that the first student
is going to give instructions for how to draw something and that they should
try to draw the picture on the board/chart paper.


 - Have the first student give the instructions. As needed, prompt the student
to begin with a title for the instructions and a starting sentence.


 - If the first student gets off target in giving the steps, recap what has been
done so far. Involve the class in helping the student give better instructions.

~~**ALPHABETIZE WORDS AND USE A DICTIONARY (10 MIN.)**~~


**Alphabetizing Words**

  - Use the following strategies and routines to teach and reinforce how to
alphabetize a series of words to the second letter.


  - Write these words in a line on the board: _start, your, thank, year, wrap._ Say,
“Let’s look at and say some words we have been learning and then list them
in alphabetical order. Remember we start by looking at the first letter. The
letter _s_ comes before the letters _t, w,_ and _y_ in the alphabet, so I will write _start_
first in our list. The letter _t_ comes after _s_ and before _w_ and _y,_ so the next word
in our list is _thank.”_ Ask students which word should come next in your list.
_(wrap)_ Say, “Yes. The letter _w_ comes after _s_ and _t_ in the alphabet, and I will
write _wrap_ under _thank.”_


  - Then ask students what letter the remaining two words begin with. _(y)_ Tell
students that to figure out the correct order of these words, they will have to
look at the second letter of each word. Ask students which letter comes first:

_o_ or _e. (e)_ Say, “Because _e_ comes before _o,_ we know that _year_ comes before
_your.”_ Write _year_ and _your_ in order.


  - Use the index cards prepared in advance with the words: _mask, cold, neck,_
_tarp, dash, mark, mush, trash, child, dark._ Distribute them to ten students
who then stand in random order at the front of the class. Have another
volunteer name which word comes first in alphabetical order. The student
with that word should move to the left to start a line of words in alphabetical
order. Continue having students name words until all of the cards are in
order.


**TEKS 1.2.E** Alphabetize a series of words to the first or second letter and use a dictionary to find words.


Foundational Skills 7


**Using a Glossary and a Dictionary**

  - Explain to students that sometimes we hear or read words that are
unfamiliar. We can use certain strategies to clarify the meaning of these
words. To clarify the meaning of words:


    - Identify the word.


    - Ask yourself: What other words surround this word? Where have you heard
this word before?


    - Finally, identify which resource materials you can use to define the word,
such as a simple dictionary or glossary.


  - Choose a book from the classroom library that uses words that students may
not know. Read a few pages aloud.


  - Say, “I am not sure I know the word _____. Point to the word. I will think about
the other words that are around this word. I will also think about where I have
heard this word before. What words are around the word I have chosen? Let’s
brainstorm where we may have heard this word before.”


  - To familiarize students with these resources, consider noting both the
glossary and the dictionary (even if the book has a glossary).


  - Display a Read-Aloud or other classroom text. Read the text for the class, and
circle a word that students may be unfamiliar with. Have students use the
strategy from the model to clarify the meaning of the word you circled.

  - Prompt students to help you, then write the phrase: “brush your teeth”
in the box.


  - Explain that you are going to act out the steps for brushing teeth and that
students should describe what it is that you do in each step. Tell students
that you will use the template to jot down their ideas.


  - Act out the first step, wetting your toothbrush, then pause and ask students
to describe the step aloud: (e.g., “The first step is to get the toothbrush
wet.”). Write the words _wet toothbrush_ in the first box.


  - Remind students that when we plan, it is OK to just write down words and
phrases so we do not forget our ideas.


  - Continue in this manner through the remaining steps. Be sure to pause after
you act out each additional step and ask students to describe it.


  - After you have acted out a step and the class has described it aloud, have
students join you in acting out the entire series of steps.


  - Tell students the last thing you will do is complete the result statement.
Tell students that the result statement should say what happens when
you follow all of these steps.

 - Explain that the next thing they need to write is a starting sentence.
The starting sentence for instructions summarizes what the instructions
are about. It starts with “The steps tell you how to . . .”


 - Refer to your planning template and ask a student to read the completed
statement: “The steps tell you how to brush your teeth.” Complete the
starting sentence on the draft template and have students read the
sentence aloud.


 - Point to the numbered lines on the draft and ask students what might go
next to each number. _(each individual step)_


 - Explain that the starting sentence is followed by the steps of the instructions.


 - Remind students of the steps they came up with during the planning phase,
acting out each step again if needed.


 - Ask students to describe the individual steps as complete sentences
and then write them on the template. Be sure to write all of your steps in
decodable sentences or display the digital version.


 - Have students read the sentences after you are finished.


 - When all five steps have been written, explain that the last thing they need to
write in a draft is the result sentence.


 - Explain that a result sentence includes the words _if_ and _then_ . It starts with
“If you do all of the steps, then . . .”


 - Write the result sentence on the template and have students read it aloud.

 - Prepare several sentences that can be expanded upon using _and_, _but_, _so_,
and _or_ . Create sentences that reference the Reader content (e.g., “Martez
splashes in the pool.” “The red dish has hot peppers.” “Jay’s mom likes a
mask.” “Carlos drives the cab.”)


**Reading**

 - Prepare to read with students who were in Group 2 in the previous lesson.
Students in Group 1 should partner read.

Students will revise and expand oral sentences using the decodable conjunctions
_and_, _but_, _so_, and _or_ . ~~**TEKS 1.11.C**~~


Students will punctuate sentences, adding periods, exclamation points, question
marks, and commas in the appropriate places. ~~**TEKS 1.11.D.ix**~~


~~**CONJUNCTIONS IN SENTENCES (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that when they speak or write, they should strive to make
their speaking or writing interesting. Remind students that one way they can
do this is by adding words called conjunctions to join phrases and sentences.


  - Conjunctions are words that connect phrases and sentences together.


  - Write the following on the board/chart paper: _Jay will visit the market._ Explain
that this is a sentence. Ask students how they can tell it is a sentence. _(It_
_begins with a capital letter and ends with a period.)_


  - Point out that this is a simple sentence, that is, it only tells us one thing:
that Jay will go to the market.


  - Ask students how they might expand this sentence and make it longer.

conventions, including punctuation marks at the end of declarative, exclamatory, and interrogative sentences.


Foundational Skills 7


 - One way we can expand sentences and make them longer is to
use words called _conjunctions_ to connect one sentence to another.
Common conjunctions are _and, but, so_, and _or_ . Write _and, but, so_,
and _or_ on the board/chart paper.


 - Demonstrate aloud how to expand sentences using each of the above
conjunctions: “Jay will visit the market and get a gift for Martez.
Jay will visit the market, but cannot tell Martez. Jay will visit the market so he
can buy a gift for Martez. Jay will visit the market or make a gift for Martez
himself.”


 - Ask students to create other sentences aloud using _and, but, so_, and _or_ .
Have students share their sentences with a partner. Explain that _and_ joins
like phrases or sentences, _but_ joins a phrase that changes the direction of
the sentence, _so_ indicates cause, and _or_ offers choices.


 - Work with students to expand sentences of their choosing. Invite a few
students to write their sentences on the board/chart paper and discuss
the use of conjunctions with the class.


~~**PUNCTUATION PRACTICE (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 18.1 to practice placing commas in
a series. They should also include the correct punctuation at the end of
each sentence.

are administering the individual assessments, other students should complete
their reports and engage in other independent activities, which may include
reading stories in Readers and completing Pausing Point activity pages.


**Silent Reading Comprehension Analysis**

 - The number of questions answered correctly indicates the following:


   - Students who score **4 or fewer questions correctly** appear to have
poor preparation for Grade 2. Administer the Fluency Assessment and
Word Reading in Isolation Assessment.


   - Students who score **5 out of 7 questions correctly** appear to have
adequate preparation for Grade 2. Administer the Fluency Assessment
and Word Reading in Isolation Assessment.


   - Students who score **6 or 7 out of 7 questions correctly** have good to
outstanding preparation for Grade 2. They need no further testing.


 - Also consider whether a student missed literal, inferential, and/or
evaluative questions.


   - Literal questions assess students’ recall of key details from the story.
These questions are text-dependent, requiring students to paraphrase
and/or refer back to the portion of the story in which the specific answer
to the question is provided. Literal questions: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6


   - Inferential questions ask students to infer information from the text and
think critically. These questions are also text-dependent, but require
students to paraphrase and/or refer back to the different portions of the
text that provide information leading to and supporting the inference they
are making. Inferential question: 3

   - Evaluative questions ask students to build upon what they have learned
from the text using analytical and application skills. These questions are
also text-dependent, but require students to paraphrase and/or refer back
to the portion(s) of the story that substantiate the argument they are
making or the opinion they are offering. Evaluative question: 7

Note to Teacher


The Fluency Assessment provides a more focused, one-on-one assessment
for students who **incorrectly answered two or more of the seven**
**questions** in the Silent Reading Comprehension Assessment. To administer
this section of the assessment, you will pull students aside individually
and ask each to read “Shark and Wee Fish” aloud to you. You should keep
a running record during this reading and calculate a Words Correct Per
Minute (W.C.P.M.) score using the guidelines that follow. This will provide
an indication of fluency. Record students’ scores (in both Oral Reading
Comprehension and Fluency) on the End-of-Year Summary Sheet
(Activity Page 19.3) for each student.


You may find the use of file folder study carrels a useful tool for
student assessment.

to tear out Activity Page 20.1 (a clean copy of “Shark and Wee Fish”) and
Activity Page 20.2, the W.C.P.M. Calculation Activity Page from the Activity
Book. You will use Activity Page 20.1 to mark as a running record as you listen
to the student read aloud.


  - Tell the student that you are going to ask them to read the story aloud,
including the Tell students to read using appropriate fluency.


  - Explain that you are going to use a watch to see how long it takes them to
read the story. Tell the student that this is not a race; the student should
read at their regular pace and not rush.


  - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the title. If you are
using a watch, write the exact Start Time, in minutes and seconds, on your
record page.


  - If you are using a stopwatch, you do not need to write down the start time

 - When the student finishes reading the story, write the exact Finish Time in
minutes and seconds on the record sheet.


 - Alternatively, if you are using a stopwatch, simply write down the Elapsed
Time in minutes and seconds.


 - If the student reads very slowly, you may need to stop the reading before the
student gets to the end of the story. (Five minutes should be enough time to
get a measurement.) If the student does not read to the end, draw a vertical
line on the record sheet to indicate how far the student read. Also write down
either the Finish Time or the Elapsed Time.


 - After the student finishes reading, ask the following comprehension
questions to see how much of the story the student understood on the
second reading.

**Guidelines for Calculating W.C.P.M. Scores**

 - If the reading was fairly accurate (< 10 uncorrected errors), you can get a
rough (and easy) estimate of a student’s W.C.P.M. score simply by noting
the time and looking at the chart on the bottom of Activity Page 20.2.


 - To calculate a student’s exact W.C.P.M. score, use the information you wrote
down on the record sheet and follow the steps described below. The steps
are also shown in graphic form on the W.C.P.M. Calculation Activity Page.
You will probably find it helpful to have a calculator available.


   - First, complete the Words section of the W.C.P.M. Calculation Activity Page.


   - Count Words Read. This is the total number of words the student read or
attempted to read, up to the point where they stopped. It includes words
the student read correctly as well as words the student read incorrectly or
skipped over. If the student attempted to read the whole story, including
the title, use 341 as your total. If the student did not finish the story, you
will need to count the number of words the student actually attempted to
read. Write the count for Words Read in the matching box on the W.C.P.M.
Calculation Activity Page.


   - Count the Uncorrected Mistakes noted in your running record. This includes
words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and words you had to
supply. Write the total in the box labeled Uncorrected Mistakes. (A mistake
that is corrected by the student is not counted as a mistake; the student is
penalized for the time he or she lost making the correction, but not for the
initial mistake.)


   - Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get Words Correct.


   - Next, complete the Time section of the activity page.


   - Calculate Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a stopwatch,
this should already be done for you. Skip to the next step.)


   - If you used a watch and recorded start and stop times, you will need to
subtract the Start Time from the Finish Time to calculate the Elapsed
Time. Subtract seconds from seconds and then minutes from minutes.


   - Calculate Time in Seconds. Multiply the number of minutes by 60 to
convert minutes to seconds, then add the number of seconds.


   - Next, complete the W.C.P.M. section of the activity page.


   - Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then multiply by 60 to get
Words Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.).

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


The Word Reading in Isolation Assessment is designed to assess a student’s
ability to read words containing the spellings that were taught and reviewed
in Grade 1. The emphasis in this assessment is solely on decoding accuracy.


It would be ideal to give all students the Word Reading in Isolation
Assessment, but if there is a time restriction, assess those students
who scored less than 50 W.C.P.M. on the Fluency Assessment.


The assessment sheet with words for students to read is at the end of
this lesson and reprinted on Activity Page 21.1. Ask students to tear out
Activity Page 21.2 for you to use as a running record and scoring sheet.


Keep in mind that a single word will target multiple letter-sound
correspondences. For example, the word _write_ assesses the ‘wr’
spelling for /r/ and the ‘i_e’ spelling for /ie/.


You may find the use of file folder study carrels a useful tool for
student assessment.


**Foundational Skills**

 - While you are administering the one-on-one assessment, students may
be rereading stories from their Readers, writing instructional paragraphs
(or other types of writing genres they have learned this year), or completing
activities and activity pages from the Pausing Point. If they have been
keeping a writing portfolio, they can read their work from the year and
select their favorite pieces.

Foundational Skills 7


~~**RECOGNIZE AND/OR WRITE THE SPELLINGS TAUGHT IN UNIT 7**~~


**Consonant Blends**

  - Use this routine when teaching one-syllable spoken words.


  - Say, “You are going to practice blending and segmenting words with
consonant blends.”


  - Say the word _explain._ Follow the routine above to blend and segment the
word. Point out that two sounds in the middle of the word, /p/ and /l/,
blend together to make ‘pl’. Have students say ‘pl’ and notice how it feels on
their tongues.


  - Say the following words: _plane, planet, split, apply._ Have students identify
the blends and whether they are at the beginning or middle of the words.
Then have them blend and segment the phonemes using motions from the
program. ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.v; TEKS 1.2.A.vii**~~


**Line Race**

  - Divide the class into two groups and line them up in front of the
board/chart paper.


  - Tell students that you will call out a sound and that you want the two
students at the front of the lines to write a spelling for that sound.


  - The student who writes a correct answer goes to the end of their line.
The other student sits down and watches for the rest of the game.


  - If both students write the same correct answer, the one who wrote it faster
continues the game and goes to the back of the line.


  - If both students write a correct answer but they are not the same (because
of spelling alternatives), the student who wrote it down faster goes to the end
of the line.


  - Continue until only one student is left standing in line.


  - **Modification:** If you have a helper in your classroom, play this game in
smaller groups.


**Build the List**

  - Tell students that you want to review the spellings for the sounds /ae/ and
/ oe/ that they learned/reviewed in Unit 7.


  - Tell students that they now know three spellings for the /ae/ sound.


  - Ask students to name those spellings. Then ask students for example words.


  - Work with students to complete a list like the one shown below, in which each
spelling is listed with at least one example word.


**TEKS 1.2.A** Demonstrate phonological awareness by (v) blending spoken phonemes to form one-syllable words, including
initial and/or final consonant blends; (vii) segmenting spoken one-syllable words of three to five phonemes into individual
phonemes, including words with initial and/or final consonant blends.


Pausing Point
**201**


- If students cannot remember a spelling pattern, write a word containing that
pattern on the board/chart paper. Have the students read it. Then ask which
letters stand for /ae/ in the word. Add the spelling and the example word to
the list.


- Repeat with the spellings for /oe/.



|/ae/|/oe/|
|---|---|
|1.<br>‘a_e’: fade, trade<br>2.<br>‘ai’: wait, rain<br>3.<br>‘ay’: lay, day|1.<br>‘o_e’: hope, hole<br>2.<br>‘oa’: soap, road|


**Spelling Alternatives Board Game**





Activity Pages
PP.1 and PP.2



**Note:** This game can be played for all sounds that have spelling alternatives.


  - Create a game board with twenty-five to forty spaces and several crossing
paths so students can move in several different directions.


  - Write a decodable /ae/ word on each square, making sure to include several
examples of each of the spelling patterns taught.


  - Give each student a scorecard that lists the spellings for /ae/ they have
learned (‘a_e’, ‘ai’, ‘ay’) with spaces to collect a word exemplifying each spelling.


  - Teach students to play the game by rolling a die (or spinning a spinner)
and moving their game piece the correct number of spaces.


  - When students land on a space, they should read the word and copy it onto
their spelling scorecard according to the spelling used for the /ae/ sound.
For example, the word _chain_ would be copied into the space for ‘ai’ words.


  - The first student to get one example of each spelling pattern wins.

~~**TEKS 1.2.C.i**~~


**Word Sort**

  - Distribute **Activity Pages PP.1** (for /ae/) or **PP.2** (for /oe/).


  - Explain that the chart printed at the top of the activity page includes a
number of words that contain the /ae/ sound (or /oe/ sound).


  - Have students read the chart, mark the words that contain the /ae/ sound
(or /oe/ sound), and sort those words according to which spelling is used to
stand for the /ae/ sound (or /oe/ sound).


**TEKS 1.2.C.i** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by spelling words with closed syllables, open syllables, VCe syllables,
vowel teams, and r-controlled syllables.


Foundational Skills 7



**202**


**Complete the Sentence**

  - Remind students that they recently learned some spelling alternatives for
the /ae/ sound.


  - Ask students if they can remember the spellings they have learned.

  - Tell students that you are going to say some incomplete sentences, each of
which is missing its last word.


  - Explain that the missing words will contain the /ae/ sound.


  - Read the first sentence.


  - Have students raise their hands and wait to be called on if they think they
know the missing word.


  - Once students have guessed the answer, write _cake_ on the board/chart
paper under the ‘a_e’ heading.


  - Repeat this process with the remaining sentences, writing each word under
its respective heading.


1. On my birthday, I eat birthday  . _(cake—‘a_e’)_


2. Drops of water that fall from the sky are called  . _(raindrops—‘ai’)_


3. If something is not ready for you, you may have to  . _(wait—‘ai’)_

~~**LESSON 5: SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


Write students’ names in the column provided. The words on today’s spelling assessment are
grouped according to spelling patterns on the Analysis of Student Errors chart. Place an X in the
column of any word that the student did not spell correctly. Examine errors for patterns using the
information provided below. If a pattern is identified, speak with the student and ask them to explain
their thinking to you. This may help you to understand the student’s confusion and allow you to clear
up the misunderstanding. You may also use previous Pausing Points to address errors with today’s
spelling words _._


The words on this week’s spelling assessment can be analyzed in many different ways. The following
are analyses that focus on errors in encoding consonant doublings in these words. Some of these
words are also two-syllable words, and you should take note of any difficulty students have in
encoding both syllables of two-syllable words. Please refer to the Unit 7 Appendix, “Using Chunking
to Decode Multisyllable Words,” for more information on assisting students who have difficulty with
multisyllable words.


Column 1


What an error in this column means: The spelling ‘a’ for the /a/ sound is the basic code spelling.
The influx of new spellings might have caused some confusion with basic code spellings.


What you should do: Please refer to the Pausing Point for additional activities. Students may need

~~**LESSON 10: SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


**Analysis of Student Errors**


Directions


Write students’ names in the column provided. The words on today’s spelling assessment are
grouped according to spelling patterns on the Analysis of Student Errors chart. Place an X in the
column of any word that the student did not spell correctly. Examine errors for patterns using the
information provided below. If a pattern is identified, speak with the student and ask them to explain
their thinking to you. This may help you to understand the student’s confusion and allow you to clear
up the misunderstanding. You may also use previous Pausing Points to address errors with today’s
spelling words.


The words on this week’s spelling assessment can be analyzed in many different ways. The following
are analyses that focus on errors in encoding consonant doublings in these words. Some of these
words are also two-syllable words, and you should take note of any difficulty students have in
encoding both syllables of two-syllable words. Please refer to the Unit 7 Appendix, “Using Chunking
to Decode Multisyllable Words,” for more information on assisting students who have difficulty with
multisyllable words.

~~**LESSON 20: END-OF-YEAR FLUENCY ASSESSMENT**~~


**Shark and Wee Fish**

Shark swam by the reef. Sharp teeth glittered
in his mouth. He shouted to the fish, “I will have a
hundred of you for my lunch!”

The fish were scared. They went and hid in a cave.

“Shark will not get us in here!” one of the fish said.
“He is too big to swim in.”

After a while, one of the fish went out to check
and see if Shark had left. His name was Wee Fish.

Wee Fish swam out of the cave. He soon found
himself face to face with Shark.

Shark snarled, “Here’s a nice fish for my lunch!”

Wee Fish had to think fast.

“Stop!” he shouted in his loudest voice. “I am the
king of this reef! All of the fish here are scared of
me, and you should be, too!”

Shark smiled. Wee Fish was just three inches long.
Shark was ten feet long. He had teeth in his mouth
that were bigger than Wee Fish.


Teacher Resources
**233**


“Is this some sort of joke?” Shark said. “Why
would fish be scared of you?”

“Swim next to me and you will see,” Wee Fish said.

Shark swam with Wee Fish. They came upon some
spotted fish. When the spotted fish saw Shark, they
got scared and swam off.

Shark and Wee Fish swam up to some striped fish.
When the striped fish saw Shark, they got scared
and swam off.

“Well, well,” said Shark to himself. “It’s odd, but it
looks like the fish are scared of Wee Fish, just as he
said.” (Shark did not see that the fish were scared
of him.)

Shark and Wee Fish swam up to some silver fish.
When the silver fish saw Shark, they got scared and
swam off.

Then Shark started to think. “All of the fish are
scared of Wee Fish,” he said to himself. “Perhaps I
should be scared of him, too.”

All of a sudden, Shark felt scared. He swam off.
And from then on, he never went back to that reef.

**Grade 1 | Foundational Skills 7**
###### Appendix: Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words


Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught will enable
students to read one-syllable words with ease. However, knowing these
individual letter-sound correspondences is no guarantee that students
will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllable words. To this
end, most students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to
recognize, chunk, and read parts of words—syllables—as a way to decode
longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small
dot is used as a visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ).
This is done in both the Activity Books and Readers. The dot is intended to
visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can then be sounded
out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated and students are
expected to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, this program introduces the decoding of two-syllable
words by having students work first with two-syllable compound words
(e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For compound words, the dot is
placed between the two component words. These are among the easiest twosyllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound
word is already a familiar spelling pattern students have encountered
in reading one-syllable words. In addition, each syllable or chunk is also
frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1
students also tackle two-syllable words that consist of a root word with a
simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing_, _hunt·er_, _bust·ed_ ). The dot is typically placed
immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain double-letter
spellings for consonants, in this program, the divider is typically placed
after the double-letter spelling rather than between the two consonants
(e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers familiar with other ways to chunk or
divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is done, however, because
the double-letter spellings have been taught as single-spelling units since


Foundational Skills 7


Kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.). This program strives
to be consistent in representing these spellings in the way that the students
have been taught to process them (e.g., as whole entities for a sound).
(Ultimately, as students become more proficient at decoding and chunking
syllables through subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether
they visually chunk and decode these words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .) Most
students find chunking and decoding these two-syllable words consisting of
root words and suffixes relatively easy.


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types
of multisyllable words. To be successful in decoding these longer words, it
is helpful if teachers and students recognize certain syllable types. Most
reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


  - **Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a**
**“short” vowel sound (e.g., /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/):** _let,_ _pad,_ _rod,_ _tin,_ _fun,_
_pic·nic,_ _un·til_


  - **Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel**
**sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /ie/, /oe/, /ue/):** _cake,_ _home,_ _like,_ _mule,_ _Pete,_
_mis·take, stam·pede_


  - **Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint,_ _speak,_ _proud,_ _play, dis·may, be·low,_ _coun·sel_


  - **R-Controlled Syllables:** _art,_ _curb,_ _girl,_ _fort,_ _clerk,_ _tur·nip, ar·tist, fe·ver_


  - **Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound**
**(e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /ie/, /oe/, /ue/):** _go,_ _me,_ _hi,_ _a·pron, f·nal, com·pre·hend_


  - **Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple, puz·zle, raf·fe, ca·ble, ri·fe_


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


  - **Schwa Syllables:** _ben·e·fit, ap·pe·tite, a·bout, hos·pit·al,_ _e·mo·tion_


**Note:** The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is
distinguished separately because of the way this spelling is chunked when
dividing words into syllables.


Appendix
**295**


**296**



**To be clear, in order to decode words, students do not need to identify**
**syllables by these names. The names of the syllable types are provided**
**here only to establish a common vocabulary for teachers as they use**
**the materials.** What is necessary, however, for students to become fluent
readers of longer words in increasingly complex text is that they be able to
visually parse certain spelling patterns as syllable chunks so they can quickly
and easily decode each syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced
is the closed syllable pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words
are also relatively easy for students to chunk and recognize as an example of
the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they encountered in onesyllable words in Kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


 - When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are
divided between the consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.


_ad · mit_ _nap · kin_ _trum · pet_


 - For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider
is typically placed after the double-letter spelling rather than between the
consonants. As noted earlier, this is done because the double-letter spellings
have been taught as single spelling units since Kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/,
‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).


_traff · ic_ _muff · in_ _happ · en_


 - When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word
is divided so the first consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two
consonants with the second vowel.


_mon · ster_ _con · tract_ _pil · grim_


Foundational Skills 7


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it
useful to use your finger to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first
syllable for them to read. Once students read the first syllable, the second
syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model for
students how to blend the two syllables aloud:


In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various
combinations of the magic ‘E’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the
r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


  - Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted
above for closed syllables:


_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


In Grade 2, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are
especially difficult to chunk because they may be divided either before or
after the single consonant. Students are taught to use a flexible approach in
chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying each
possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


Appendix
**297**


**298**




 - When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in
front of the consonant and sound it out as an open syllable:


_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_


However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating
a closed syllable. There is no definitive rule for when to divide before or
after the consonant. Students will need to be flexible and try dividing
and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to
determine whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each
possibility. In order to recognize whether a word is familiar when sounded
either way, the word must be one that the student has heard before (i.e., the
word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent
an additional challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or
for whom English is a second language.


Foundational Skills 7


  - If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:


_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables.
Chunking these words into syllables is fairly straightforward.


  - When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the
consonant, creating a first syllable that may be an open, closed or even
r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings in the words


_ban · gle_ _twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_


In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which
various spellings represent the schwa sound. English words with more
than one syllable usually include a combination of stressed and unstressed
syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed or weakly stressed,
its vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that
linguists call a schwa. This happens in many English words. Spellings for the
schwa sound include ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’, and ‘tion’. Chunking and decoding words
that include the schwa sound can be quite challenging for many students.


Appendix
**299**


**300**




 - Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that
the syllable with the schwa sound has a particular spelling:


_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is actually a schwa syllable, but
it is identified separately because of the way this spelling is chunked when
dividing words into syllables.


 - Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in
Grade 1, they study prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth
and are taught to chunk syllables accordingly throughout the entire year of
Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _tri·cycle_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness_ _help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught
in Kindergarten—Grade 3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words
into smaller decodable parts, students will have the tools they need to
independently decode just about any word they encounter.

In order for the ELL to meet grade-level learning expectations across the<br>foundation and enrichment curriculum, all instruction delivered in English must be linguistically accommodated (communicated,<br>sequenced, and scaffolded) commensurate with the student’s level of English language proficiency. For kindergarten and grade<br>1, certain of these student expectations apply to text read aloud for students not yet at the stage of decoding written text. The<br>student is expected to:|
|ELPS 4.A|learn relationships between sounds and letters of the<br>English language and decode (sound out) words using a<br>combination of skills such as recognizing sound-letter<br>relationships and identifying cognates, affixes, roots,<br>and base words|p. 79|
|ELPS 4.B|recognize directionality of English reading such as left<br>to right and top to bottom||
|ELPS 4.C|develop basic sight vocabulary, derive meaning<br>of environmental print, and comprehend English<br>vocabulary and language structures used routinely in<br>written classroom materials|p. 88|
|ELPS 4.D|use prereading supports such as graphic organizers,<br>illustrations, and pretaught topic-related vocabulary<br>and other prereading activities to enhance<br>comprehension of written text|p. 103|
|ELPS 4.E|read linguistically accommodated content area material<br>with a decreasing need for linguistic accommodations<br>as more English is learned||
|ELPS 4.F|use visual and contextual support and support from<br>peers and teachers to read grade-appropriate content<br>area text, enhance and confirm understanding, and<br>develop vocabulary, grasp of language structures,<br>and background knowledge needed to comprehend<br>increasingly challenging language|p. 53|
|ELPS 4.G|demonstrate comprehension of increasingly complex<br>English by participating in shared reading, retelling or<br>summarizing material, responding to questions, and<br>taking notes commensurate with content area and<br>grade level needs|p. 23, p. 34, p. 72, p. 93, p. 94, p. 104, p. 123, p. 130,<br>p. 140, p. 170, p. 178|
|ELPS 4.H|read silently with increasing ease and comprehension<br>for longer periods||
|ELPS 4.I|demonstrate English comprehension and expand<br>reading skills by employing basic reading skills such<br>as demonstrating understanding of supporting ideas<br>and details in text and graphic sources, summarizing<br>text, and distinguishing main ideas from details<br>commensurate with content area needs||
