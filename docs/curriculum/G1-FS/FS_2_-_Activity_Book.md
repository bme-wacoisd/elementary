**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the
Teacher Guide for Unit 2. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the
lesson number and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there
are two activity pages for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. The
activity pages in this book do not always include written instructions for students because
the instructions would have words that are not decodable. Teachers will explain these activity
pages to the students orally, using the instructions in the Teacher Guide. The Activity Book is a
student component, which means each student should have an Activity Book.

Today our class started the second unit for our English Language Arts program. The
Reader for this unit is called _Gran_ . Your student will bring home stories you can read
together about the adventurous Gran and her grandchildren, Josh and Jen. Remember
that reading at home with your student is important for their success as a reader.


In addition, your student today has been taught to read words with the double–letter
spelling ‘ee’, as in _feet_ . To practice this new spelling, ask your student to cut out the word
cards below. In addition to words with the ‘ee’ spelling, some of the words below are
Tricky Words; Tricky Words have parts that are underlined because they do not play by the
sound rules. Have your student read all of the words aloud, and arrange the cards to make
phrases such as _the eel, three sheep, long speech_, etc. You may also ask your student to
copy the phrases onto a sheet of paper. Please keep the cards for future practice.

Your student read this story in class. Please ask your student to read the story aloud
to you. Remind your student that the underlined parts of words signal that this part
is tricky and does not follow the sound rules they have learned. Also remind your
student that the bolded ‘ **ee** ’ signals that these letters are sounded as /ee/, as in the
word _feet_ .

**Gran’s Trips**

“When will Gran get here?”
Josh asks.


Jen shrugs.


Just then, Josh and Jen

Your student has been taught to read the Tricky Words _he_, _she_, _me_, _they_, and _their_ . In
addition, your student has learned to read words with the separated digraph ‘a_e’, as in
_bake_ . Tricky Words are hard to read because they contain parts that are not pronounced
the way one would expect. Words with separated digraph ‘a_e’ can be challenging to
read because the reader has to recognize that the letters ‘a’ and ‘e’ are separated by a
consonant, but they still work together to make a vowel sound.


Have your student first read the Tricky Words in the box and then the sentences below.
Your student will need to figure out which Tricky Word makes sense in each sentence. Note
that the tricky parts are underlined. Then have your student write the correct Tricky Word
for each sentence on the line.

Dear Family Member,


Ask your student to cut out the word cards. Show the cards to your student and have
your student read them. Ask your student to say a phrase or sentence with each word.
Extension: Ask your student to copy the words onto a sheet of paper. Further extension:
Read the words aloud and have your student write the words down, paying attention to the
separated digraphs. Please keep the cards for future practice.
