# **Welcome!**
## Grade 1, Unit 6 Foundational Skills

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will learn spelling alternatives for consonant sounds and pronouns and will be introduced to

personal narratives.


**What** **will** **my** **student** **learn?**


Students will review previously learned alternatives for consonant sounds and will learn new ones, such as /s/

spelled ‘c’, ‘ce’, and ‘se’. They will also learn /n/ spelled ‘kn’, /ng/ spelled ‘n’, and /w/ spelled ‘wh’. Students will learn

strategies and how to use context clues to self-correct when reading words with these sounds. Students will read

stories and answer questions about a girl named Grace who lives on a farm. These stories will be a bit longer than

previous ones. Students will learn to build phrases with adjectives and create mental images of these phrases.

Students will also be introduced to pronouns. In addition, students will begin dictation of spelling words and

sentences as well as explore personal narratives.


**Additional** **Practice**


**Tricky** **Word**

Students can practice this word each night by doing the following activities:


1. **Sentence** **Creation:** Have your student use the Tricky Word in a sentence. Encourage them to create

sentences that demonstrate the meaning of the word and explain its context.

2. **Word** **Association:** Ask your student to think of other words related to the Tricky Word. This will help

reinforce their understanding of the word’s meaning and usage.
