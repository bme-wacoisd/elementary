Introduction


~~**WELCOME**~~


Dear First Grade Teacher,


Welcome to the program! This program has been carefully researched and crafted in order to make
every child in your classroom a reader. The program is divided into two strands: a Skills Strand and a
Knowledge Strand. You are currently reading the introduction to Unit 1 of the Skills Strand.


Some key aspects of the Skills Strand are listed below.


  - The Skills Strand provides comprehensive instruction in foundational reading skills, including
phonological awareness, phonics and word recognition, language skills (including conventions of
English, spelling, and grammar), as well as reading comprehension and writing instruction.


  - The program includes explicit, systematic phonics instruction in which students are taught the lettersound correspondences needed to independently decode words.


  - The program begins by teaching the most common or least ambiguous spelling for a sound (the
basic code spelling); later it teaches spelling alternatives for sounds, which can be spelled several
different ways. The system is kept simple at first and complexity is added bit by bit as students gain
confidence and automatize their reading and writing skills.


  - The program uses a synthetic phonics approach that teaches students to read by blending through
the word. It does not teach multiple cueing strategies, use of pictures as a primary resource in
decoding, or part-word guessing.


  - Students who successfully completed the Kindergarten program learned the most frequent or least
ambiguous spelling for all of the single consonant sounds; consonant clusters, such as ‘fl’, ‘br’, and
‘st’; consonant digraphs such as ‘sh’, ch’, and ‘th’; double letter spellings such as ‘ss’, ‘ff’, and ‘ck’; and
at least one spelling for the short and long vowel sounds. Kindergarten students also were introduced
to more than 100 high-frequency words from the Dolch Sight Word List and Fry’s Instant Words List.


The remainder of this introduction will provide you with an overview of the various materials
included in the Grade 1 Skills Strand, general unit and lesson features, and detailed information
about this first unit of Skills instruction and how you will determine whether your students have the
prerequisite skills needed to be successful in the Grade 1 program.


(To learn more about the two strands and the rationale for the two strand approach, please consult
Appendix A at the end of this unit.)

~~**TEACHER COMPONENT DESCRIPTIONS**~~


**Teacher Guide**


Each Skills Teacher Guide includes daily lessons that provide detailed direction for all Skills
instruction. The Teacher Guide will indicate whether instruction and/or accompanying activities
should be presented as whole group, small group, or independent practice. Instruction and exercises
should be presented in the order listed in the Lesson at a Glance chart.


**Grammar:** Specific grammar lessons and exercises address various parts of speech and language
usage conventions, such as capitalization and punctuation, as identified in the Texas Essential
Knowledge and Skills standards. Students first learn these concepts and practice them orally. Then
they are reinforced in written text. You will also find grammar teaching opportunities in demonstration stories. Students will also practice grammar in the daily Warm-Ups. Grammar instruction starts
in Unit 1, with an introduction to nouns.


**Spelling:** Explicit spelling instruction will begin in Unit 3. Weekly word lists and exercises focused
on the spellings of given sounds are included, followed by a weekly assessment. The spelling exercises provide a systematic review of the letter-sound correspondences that students have already
learned. The weekly assessment can also provide insight as to which students may have gaps in
their code knowledge and may require remedial attention.


Students will also create a Dictation Journal that focuses on spelling words in isolation as well as in
sentences. Spelling assessments that begin in Unit 3 will also incorporate a sentence that students
must spell correctly.


  - For the dictation journal, you can either have students use a journal they use for other writing
activities or you may wish to create a small dictation journal for each student. Stapling five pieces of
paper together is all you will need for each journal. (1)


~~**WRITING**~~


Formal writing instruction designed to address the standards in writing starts in Unit 3. Students
will receive instruction in using a four-step writing process: plan, draft, edit, and publish. (Note that
students will also have additional writing opportunities in the Knowledge Strand to organize and
apply the specific content learned during Read-Alouds.)


**Left-Handed Handwriting Guidance**

  - Consider your seating arrangement for left-handed students. The placement of the arms and elbows
in relation to other students can impact their writing space.


  - Encourage your students to hold their writing tools correctly to reduce hand strain. Allow time for
students to develop their hand strength in writing.


  - Providing pencil grips for students could alleviate the strain on their hands when writing.


Introduction
**3**


     - Orienting the paper at an angle can help left-handed students write more easily and comfortably.
Consider using paper with a raised line for students to rest their hands on as they write.


**Consonant and Vowel Code Flip Books and Spelling Cards**


The Consonant and Vowel Code Flip Books will be used in Unit 1 with the Spelling Cards in a whole group
review of sound/spelling correspondences taught in Kindergarten. These may also be used at any time
during the year with individual or groups of students in need of targeted remediation and practice.


Students who participated in this program in Kindergarten are very familiar with the introduction
and review of letter-sound correspondences. In Kindergarten, this information was presented and
displayed on large wall posters in each classroom. In Grade 1, the code information previously
included on these wall posters is presented as two new instructional tools: (1) Code Flip Books,
one for consonants and one for vowels, used for group instruction and classroom display, and (2)
Individual Code Charts for each student.


The Code Flip Books show (in gray print) the spellings for all sounds taught. As you review each
sound in this unit you will be asked to place the Spelling Card for that sound on the appropriate
Code Flip Book page.


Each Spelling Card is printed front and back. One side of the card shows the sound. The other
side of the card shows three things: the top shows the spelling; the bottom shows a sample
word containing the spelling; in the middle is something called a power bar. The power bar gives
an indication of how common the spelling is for the sound it represents. A long power bar that
stretches almost across the card means that this is the main spelling for the sound and that there
are very few words that have this sound spelled any other way. A very short power bar means that
the spelling is less common and occurs in fewer English words.


Also note that vowel sound/spellings will always be written in green on the Spelling Cards because when
saying a vowel sound, the mouth is wide open, letting the air “go”; the one exception to this are the
r-controlled vowel sound/spellings, which are written in blue. Consonant sound/spellings are written in red.


**Note:** The exercises in the Unit 1 lessons are not designed to teach sound/spelling correspondences
to students who have not mastered the code in Kindergarten; they are intended for review. Students


Foundational Skills 1
**4**


who have large gaps in their code knowledge will be identified through the placement assessments
presented during Lessons 4–8 of this unit so that they can be appropriately placed in the level of
materials that will meet their individual instructional needs.


**Big Books (Units 1–3)**


The Big Books are exact replicas of the student Readers, but larger. They can be used for demonstration
stories as you model reading for students. In Grade 1, the stories for Units 1–3 are available as both
Readers and Big Books. All stories from the Readers are also available in digital format within the
program’s online materials so they can be displayed or projected for all students to see.


**Large Letter Cards**


This set of letter cards is used for teaching and reviewing sounds and spellings, especially during
Large Card Chaining exercises. The cards are used throughout Grade 1.


~~**STUDENT COMPONENT DESCRIPTIONS**~~


**Individual Code Chart**


The Individual Code Chart reproduces the code information included in the Vowel Code Flip Book
and the Consonant Code Flip Book in a more concise manner. Students will use the Individual Code
Chart to record the vowel sound/spelling correspondences and selected consonant sound/spelling
correspondences that they learn. Please note that, when there are multiple spellings for a sound,
the spellings are arranged in order from the most frequent to the least frequent spelling. These
charts are a good way for students to have at hand a guide to help them remember what they have
learned. You may wish to encourage students to refer to the Individual Code Chart when reading and
writing independently.


**Activity Book**


The Activity Book is organized by lesson; the Teacher Guide provides direction within each lesson
as to when and how each Activity Book page should be used. Some activity pages are designed
to be completed as a group with your assistance, while other pages are intended to be completed
independently by students. In addition to practice exercises for reinforcement of skills, the Activity
Book also includes assessment pages, homework, copies of the stories read in class and TakeHome letters for family members. You can find the digital version of the Activity Book with the online
materials so it can be displayed or projected for all to see as you give directions and/or provide
scaffolded instruction modeling how to complete each page.


**Reader**


Each unit includes a student Reader. The stories are 100% decodable, meaning they only use
words and spellings that have been explicitly taught and practiced. The last page of each Reader
summarizes the code knowledge that is assumed at the beginning of the Reader (i.e., the code
knowledge that has been taught in previous units) and identifies new code knowledge introduced in
the current unit, noting the first story in which these new skills are practiced.


Introduction
**5**


Tricky Words found throughout the stories are underlined to signal to students that the word
does not follow basic code rules taught in the lessons.


The last few stories in each Reader are extra stories for the Pausing Point, which can be used for
assessment or extra reading depending on students’ needs. You can find the digital versions of the
Skills stories with the online materials. These digital files allow you to present a Skills story as a
demonstration story, using a computer and a projector or an interactive whiteboard, instead of the
Big Book.


~~**UNIT AND LESSON FEATURES**~~


Within each Teacher Guide, you will find the following elements in the order listed:


     - A **table of contents** provides a quick overview of the time allocation, skills, and activities included in
each lesson and the unit as a whole.


     - Individual lessons for the unit:


        - Each lesson begins with a list of the **Primary Focus Objectives** . These objectives are tagged
with the corresponding standard(s). The objectives are repeated in subsequent parts of the lesson
in association with the specific instructional activity with which they are associated.


Foundational Skills 1
**6**


    - A list of the **Formative Assessment** opportunities within the lesson that are linked to the Primary
Focus Objectives and also tagged with the corresponding standard(s). Not every Primary Focus
Objective is evaluated in every lesson. Rather, specific objectives are evaluated in different
lessons. Over the course of the entire unit, the Primary Focus Objectives are assessed on multiple
occasions so that you have a clear sense of individual student progress with regards to unit skills
before the end of the unit.


    - A **Lesson at a Glance** chart that lists the lesson’s instructional activities, the materials needed,
and the amount of time allotted to each activity.


    - **Advance Preparation** tips prompt you to select and/or prepare lesson materials prior to the
lesson. Whenever a lesson activity suggests that you write something on the board/chart paper,
this information is included in Advance Preparation. Additionally, these materials, as well as any
activity pages that you will model completing, are also available online as **digital components**
that you may access and project during the lesson; URLs are provided. Finally, **Universal Access**
preparation prompts are also included to ensure that you are ready to adapt specific activities as
needed for special needs students and/or Emergent Bilingual Students.


    - Throughout the lesson, **Support** and **Challenge** sidebars provide further guidance to assist you
in differentiating instruction. **Emergent Bilingual Students** sidebars provide specific tips for
working with Emergent Bilingual Students.


    - **Take-Home Material** is also identified at the end of some lessons to maximize reinforcement of
skills taught during the lesson and to encourage family member involvement. Use of these activity
pages is optional, but highly recommended. Should you choose to use them, please distribute the
pages and instruct students to take them home to complete. At your discretion, these Take-Home
pages may also be used in classroom centers during other times of the day.


    - Foundational Skills Remediation **Additional Support** activities are suggested at the end of each
lesson for more practice and follow-up reinforcement of skills outside the 60-minute instructional
block devoted to the program. These activities can be used with any students needing more help,
including students with special needs and Emergent Bilingual Students.


  - End-of-unit **Student Performance Assessment(s)** are included in the final lesson(s) of each unit.


  - **Pausing Point** suggestions for further practice and reinforcement follow the last unit lesson. Pausing
Point activities are organized by the unit objectives they address. **It is strongly recommended that**
**you pause for 2 days at the end of each unit to solidify the skills that have been introduced in**
**the unit.** All students will benefit from an additional opportunity to reread pages from the decodable
student Readers. It is particularly important to make use of targeted activities if the end-of-unit
assessment and/or formative assessments indicate that any students are experiencing difficulties
with specific skills taught during the unit.


  - **Appendices** that provide more detailed information are sometimes included in the Teacher Guide.


  - A **Teacher Resources** section, comprised of assorted forms and documents for monitoring student
progress, resources used for any Additional Support activities, as well as an answer key for the unit
activity pages, completes each Teacher Guide.


Introduction
**7**


~~**UNIT 1 ORGANIZATION**~~


Unit 1 will be a review for students who completed the Kindergarten program. In Unit 1, students will
review the sounds and spellings taught in the Kindergarten curriculum. They will read decodable
stories from the Reader, _Snap Shots_ . Grammar instruction also starts in Unit 1, with an introduction
to nouns.


**Back-to-School Week (Lessons 1–3)**


The Back-to-School lessons reacquaint students with daily routines and exercises. In addition, the
Back-to-School lessons prepare students for the placement assessments that follow this week by
providing practice and review of reading skills and code knowledge.


**Placement Assessment (Lessons 4–8)**


During this week, all students will participate in a comprehensive series of placement assessments
to evaluate their knowledge of the skills taught in the Kindergarten program. Detailed instructions
are provided for analyzing each student’s performance, along with suggestions for gradewide planning to determine the most effective and efficient way to group students for phonics
instruction. **It is imperative that students be placed in groups that correspond with their**
**reading abilities. Students must receive instruction that is a good match for their current**
**reading abilities and knowledge of the code.**


**Review of Sound/Spelling Correspondences (Lessons 9–15)**


These lessons review the majority of sounds and spellings taught in the Kindergarten curriculum.
You will be reviewing several things at once: the sound (e.g., /b/), the letter name (e.g., “bee”), the
lowercase letter (e.g., ‘b’), and the uppercase letter (e.g.,‘B’).


The presentation and practice of sound/spelling correspondences in these lessons, most of which
should be familiar to students who participated in the Kindergarten program, allows for a rapid
review. Although the pace is fast, it should be appropriate and helpful for students who have already
learned the bulk of these letter-sound correspondences, but may have forgotten some of the
correspondences over the summer.


However, the pace will be too rapid for students who know only a few of the letter-sound
correspondences. The Story Reading Assessment and the Word Reading Assessment that is
administered during Lessons 4–8 will identify students who struggle with recognizing these lettersound correspondences. Following administration of the placement assessments, any struggling
students should be placed at an earlier point of the grade-level materials for Skills instruction.

      - the sound /th/ spelled ‘th’ ( _thin_ )


     - the sound /th/ spelled ‘th’ ( _them_ )


      - the sound combination /qu/ spelled ‘qu’ ( _quit_ )


      - the sound /ng/ spelled ‘ng’ ( _sing_ )


~~**NOTES ON UNIT 1 SOUNDS AND SPELLINGS**~~


**Sound Combinations /x/ and /qu/**


The /x/ sound actually consists of two sounds, /k/ and /s/. It is taught as if it were one sound
because it is often written with a single letter, ‘x’. Likewise, /qu/ consists of two sounds, /k/ and
/w/. It is treated as if it were one sound because the two letters in the digraph ‘qu’ occur as a unit.
There is no need to explain this to the class, but if a student notices that /x/ or /qu/ consist of two
sounds, you should praise the student for noticing this.


**Consonant Digraphs (‘ch’ for /ch/, ‘sh’ for /sh/, ‘th’ for /th/ and /th/, ‘ng’ for /ng/)**


The term _digraph_ refers to two letters that stand for a single sound. It is not necessary to teach this
term to students. (You might prefer to use the term _letter team_ .) However, **it is important that**
**students understand that a letter can stand for a single sound all by itself or it can work**
**with a second letter to stand for a single sound.** Some students may need extra practice with
consonant digraphs.


**The Double-Letter Spellings for Consonant Sounds**


The double-letter spellings for consonant sounds were taught in Unit 8 of Kindergarten, and might
be new to students who did not get that far. Some of these are rare in one-syllable words, so you
should use a decodable two-syllable example (e.g., _shopping_ for the ‘pp’ spelling). It is unlikely that
these spellings will be problematic for students when they are reading. If a student knows that ‘f’
is sounded /f/, he or she will quickly learn that ‘ff’ is sounded /f/ as well. However, these spellings
may cause some trouble when a student is writing because the student has to choose between two
possible spellings—‘f’ and ‘ff’. This is also true of the other spelling alternatives that are reviewed
during this unit. A student spelling /k/ has to choose between ‘c’, ‘k’, ‘cc’, and ‘ck’. Some students
will need a lot of exposure to print in order to learn when to write sounds with the basic code
spelling and when to write them with a spelling alternative. At this point, praise any spelling that is a
plausible representation of the sounds in the word. Accept _stuf_ for _stuff_, _kab_ for _cab_, _eg_ for _egg_, etc.


Foundational Skills 1
**10**


**The Tricky Spellings ‘th’ (Pronounced /th/ or /th/) and ‘s’ (Pronounced /s/ or /z/)**


When a spelling can be sounded more than one way, we say that the spelling is a “tricky spelling.”
In this unit, students learn (or are reminded) that the letters ‘th’ can stand for two slightly different
sounds: voiceless /th/ as in _thin_ and voiced /th/ as in _them_ . (You can use the pairs _teeth—teethe_
and _ether—either_ to help them hear the difference.) Students also learn that the letter ‘s’ is usually
pronounced /s/ but is sometimes pronounced /z/. This pronunciation is used in a handful of very
common words, including _is_, _has_, _as_, _his_, and _was_ . It is also used in many cases when an ‘s’ is added
to a word to mark a plural, as in _dogs_, or in the present-tense form of some verbs, as in _she runs_ .


Fortunately, neither one of these tricky spellings is likely to cause major difficulties while reading.
The tricky spelling ‘th’ does not generally cause troubles because /th/ and /th/ sound very similar.
The tricky spelling ‘s’ is also usually not problematic. It is pronounced /z/ after voiced sounds
( _dogs_, _bins_ ) and /s/ after voiceless sounds ( _cats_, _ducks_ ), but our mouths tend to choose /s/ or
/z/ automatically, without having to think about it. (Try pronouncing _dogs_ as /dogs/ as opposed to
/ dogz/; you will find that your mouth resists.) Students may need more time to learn when to spell
/z/ with an ‘s’.


An effort has been made to minimize the number of tricky spellings students are exposed to in the
early part of Grade 1. The tricky spellings are introduced gradually as the sequence progresses.


**Warm-Ups**


Lessons in Grade 1 frequently begin with a Warm-Up exercise. The Warm-Ups are intended to be
quick reviews that help students focus for the lesson of the day. For the Warm-Ups of this unit,
students will practice blending and segmenting words that contain up to four sounds. They will also
practice letter-sound correspondences and review grammar lessons. Students will also practice
Tricky Words.


**Tricky Words**


The term _Tricky Word_ refers to a word that cannot be sounded out using the letter-sound
correspondences that students have been taught so far. In other words, the word is not pronounced
quite the way you would expect based on the letters in its printed form. During this unit, students
will review the following Tricky Words: _a_, _I_, _of_, _is_, _all_, _some_, _from_, _word_, _are_, _were_, _have_, _one_, _once_, _to_,
_do_, _two_, _who_, _the_, _said_, _says_, _was_, _when_, _where_, _why_, _what_, _which_, _here_, and _there_ .


Each of these Tricky Words has an irregular element, but most contain parts that can be blended.
When introducing these words, be sure to point out which parts are regular and can be blended and
which parts are not regular and simply must be remembered. You might want to create a word wall
with Tricky Words, adding to your wall each time a new word is introduced. Tricky Words printed on
yellow cards remind students to use caution when reading them.


Introduction
**11**


All of the Tricky Words were taught in the Kindergarten sequence. For students who did not go
through the Kindergarten sequence, these words may be completely new. Once a Tricky Word has
been introduced in a lesson, it will be underlined in the Reader and on activity pages until it has been
seen around twenty times.


A few words should be said about “sight words.” The term _sight word_ is often used to describe a
common word that students should practice reading and learn to recognize rapidly. At the same
time, a sight word may be a Tricky Word. It is necessary to distinguish between words that are
genuinely tricky (words like _one_, _two_, _of_, _who_, and _could_ ) and words that are high-frequency but
pronounced as expected (words like _in_, _at_, _on_, and _up_ ). Words in this last category should not be
taught as Tricky Words since there is actually nothing tricky about them.


At the end of each lesson, there is a note about when common sight words become decodable. You
can do traditional sight word activities with words once they have either become decodable or been
introduced as Tricky Words.


**Reader: Snap Shots**


In the second half of Unit 1, students will begin to read decodable stories in the Reader _Snap Shots_ .
The stories are told from Beth’s point of view. Beth is a young girl who travels from the United
States to the United Kingdom to visit friends.


The first three stories are to be presented to the class as demonstration stories, using the Big
Book or using the images found in the program’s online materials. Demonstration stories allow you
to model fluent reading and concepts of print. They also allow you to review grammar concepts,
reinforce punctuation and Tricky Words, and discuss important vocabulary words.


It is strongly recommended that when assigning selections from the Reader, you ask students to
engage in partner reading. Partner reading involves two students taking turns reading both new
and old stories to each other. The National Reading Panel found that _repeated oral reading_ boosted
reading achievement, and partner reading is an efficient way to do repeated oral reading.


Planning and establishing a partner reading routine will help this activity run smoothly. You should
consider things such as: (1) where students will partner read in your classroom; (2) good partner
reading manners, such as taking turns; and (3) what to do when students finish reading a story
before others.


Partner reading may be conducted as an oral activity in which students take turns reading a
paragraph or a page aloud to one another. Partner reading may also be used as a silent reading
activity in which each student is instructed to read the page to himself or herself and then, when his
or her partner has also completed reading that page, to discuss what was read and ask questions of
one another.


Foundational Skills 1
**12**


Silent reading can also be combined with oral reading by having both students read a single page
silently, and then having one student reread it aloud.


Comprehension is the goal of learning to read. Oral comprehension discussion questions are
included in the Teacher Guide. The discussion questions are labeled _Literal_, _Inferential_, or _Evaluative_ .
Literal questions can be answered by citing a specific text reference or illustration. Inferential
questions require understanding and interpretation of text or illustrations. Evaluative questions
require students to imagine and hypothesize an answer. In addition, activity pages with written
comprehension questions for students to complete are also included for many stories.


~~**UNIT 1 ASSESSMENTS**~~


**Placement Assessment**


As noted earlier, a comprehensive placement assessment of prerequisite skills needed for
successful participation in Grade 1 instruction will be administered to all students during Lessons
4–8 of this unit. Detailed information about these assessments and how to administer them
is provided immediately preceding Lesson 4. Detailed information on scoring, analyzing, and
interpreting student performance for grouping and placement purposes is provided immediately
following Lesson 8.


**Formative Assessment and Additional Support**


Throughout this unit, formative assessments are clearly marked for monitoring individual student
performance and progress in key skills.


In some instances, you will be directed to collect and analyze student performance on specific
activity pages. In other cases, you will be prompted to observe and record the responses of specific
students during instruction. In these instances, you will find formal observation records included in
Teacher Resources. It is recommended that you copy these forms and keep them on a clipboard for
handy reference. Quick “Checks for Understanding” to evaluate classroom performance as a whole
are also designated in various lessons.


**Note:** Formative Assessments are not included during Placement Assessment lessons (Lessons 4–8).


Careful attention to this information, collected on a daily basis, will enable you to quickly determine
which students may benefit from reteaching and/or more practice in particular skills using the
Additional Support activities found at the end of each lesson.


**Student Performance Assessment**


Typically, each Skills unit concludes with an end-of-unit assessment to measure each student’s
mastery of the particular skills taught in a given unit. Given the fact that this unit is a review of
Kindergarten skills and the extensive placement assessment that is administered during the unit to
evaluate each student’s grasp of these skills, no formal end-of-unit assessment is provided in Unit 1.

Introduction

Back-to-School Week


After the summer break, all students need time to reacclimate to the school environment. The
“Back-to-School” lessons are designed to provide that opportunity for students. They will also allow
you an opportunity to begin to get to know students as you observe how they complete these review
lessons in which no new skills are introduced.


Please take the time to teach these procedures thoroughly, making sure that you present at
least part of every exercise in each lesson. Use the time recommendations for each exercise as a
guideline. If you find that you have exceeded the time estimated for the initial activities in a lesson,
please adjust the remaining exercises accordingly by doing fewer items per exercise. Remember
that the point of these Back-to-School lessons is to remind students of routines. If necessary, do
fewer items per exercise, but try to do all exercises in every lesson.


As students learn the procedures, your presentation of each lesson will become more efficient.
Do not get frustrated in these first days if it takes a little longer to do portions of the lessons. The
lessons will become a routine and you will be glad that you took the time to do it.


The following exercises are included in the Back-to-School lessons:


~~**CODE FLIP BOOK REVIEW**~~


Letter-sound correspondences are presented to students in the Code Flip Books: one for
consonants and one for vowels. The Code Flip Books are used for group instruction and classroom
display.


The Code Flip Books are used with a set of Spelling Cards that are to be affixed to the appropriate
Code Flip Book pages as sounds and spellings are reviewed in Unit 1. The Code Flip Books show (in
gray print) the spellings for all sounds taught in Grade 1. As you review the sounds in this unit (and
introduce new sounds in later units), you will be asked to place the Spelling Card on the appropriate
Code Flip Book page.


Foundational Skills 1
**16**


Each Spelling Card is printed front and back. One side of the card shows the sound:





The other side of the Spelling Card shows the spelling at the top. The bottom shows a sample
word containing the spelling. In the middle is something called a power bar. The power bar gives
an indication of how common this spelling is for the sound it represents. A long power bar that
stretches almost across the card means that this is the main spelling for the sound and there are
very few English words that have this sound spelled any other way. A very short power bar means
that the spelling is less common and occurs in fewer English words.


**Note:** The exercises in the Back-to-School lessons are not designed to teach letter-sound
correspondences to students who have not mastered the code taught in Kindergarten. Students
who have large gaps in their code knowledge will be identified through the placement assessments
presented during Lessons 4–8 of this unit so that they can be appropriately placed in the level of
materials that will meet their individual instructional needs.


As noted earlier, these lessons are intended to remind students to think about letter-sound
correspondences and the written English code after the summer break. Keep the Code Flip Book
Reviews and other exercises briskly paced so they do not become tedious.


Introduction
**17**


~~**CHAINING**~~


Students have been completing chaining exercises since the earliest Kindergarten units. This
critical activity reinforces students’ ability to manipulate the sounds in words in which only a
single sound/spelling is changed, added, or deleted at a time, such as _cat_     - _hat_ ; _cat_     - _cab_ ; _at_     - _hat_ ;
or _cat_     - _at_ . ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.iv**~~


In Kindergarten, students chained by manipulating individual letter cards on either an individual
Chaining Folder or group pocket chart. In Grade 1, chaining activities are completed by using a
pocket chart with index cards or by you or students writing on a blackboard, whiteboard, interactive
whiteboard, or chart paper.


During the Back-to-School lessons, remember to present the chaining exercise exactly as it is
written; do not make up your own chaining activities.


~~**SMALL GROUP WORK**~~


During Back-to-School Week and throughout this unit, you will be presented with an opportunity
to work with students in small groups. The following criteria is recommended for two groups:
one group will consist of independent workers while the other consists of students needing more
support. Of course, you may subdivide your class further. Small group work is typically suggested
either during story reading time or when students are completing activity pages.


You may have both groups work on the same skill with the independent group working mainly on
their own, while the other group receives guidance from you. You may also use small group time to
reteach/reinforce a skill that you feel needs further practice with students needing more support.
For reinforcing skills, you can use the Additional Support activities from relevant lessons and/or
consult the Unit 1 Pausing Point for additional exercises and activity pages (these materials can also
be used as enrichment exercises for students who finish before others).


**TEKS 1.2.A.iv** Demonstrate phonological awareness by recognizing the change in spoken word when a specified phoneme is added, changed, or removed.

~~**WARM-UP (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Display the Consonant Code Flip Book and the Vowel Code Flip Book within
view of all students.


  - Briefly flip through either or both of the Code Flip Books and ask students if
the information on these pages looks similar to anything they recall using in
Kindergarten. Assist students in remembering that last year they had Sound
Posters with picture cards (Sound Cards) displayed in their classrooms; the
Sound Posters and Cards showed the ways that the consonant and vowel
sounds could be spelled.


  - Explain that the Code Flip Books are similar to the Sound Posters—one
Code Flip Book shows the vowel sounds and their spellings and the other
shows the consonant sounds and their spellings. Remind students that
vowel sounds such as /a/ and /i/ are made with an open mouth. Consonant
sounds like /m/ and /s/ are made with parts of the mouth touching or
closed, so the air coming out of the mouth is blocked in some way.


  - Show students the /a/ Spelling Card with the ‘a’— _pat_ side facing students.
Point to the ‘a’ and ask students to name the letter. Then read the word _pat_
and remind them that the letter ‘a’ is used to spell and write /a/ in English
words. Remind students that /a/ is a vowel sound; vowel sounds will always
be written in green on the Spelling Cards because when we say a vowel
sound, we open our mouths, letting the air “go.”

spelling for a sound, a spelling used in lots and lots of words, there will be a
long power bar on the card, stretching almost across the entire card. If the
card shows a less common spelling for the sound, a spelling used in a smaller
number of words, the card will have a shorter power bar.


**Oral Blending** ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.v**~~

  - Explain that you will say sounds for students to blend into words.


  - Say _at_ in a segmented fashion, marking each sound with a thumb-finger tap.
Start with a thumb-forefinger tap.


  - Blend the sounds to produce the word _at_, making a fist with your hand.


  - Have students tap and blend the sounds in the word.


**Oral Segmenting** ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.vii**~~

  - Hold up two fingers and say the word _at_ .


  - Have students repeat the word after you.


  - Wiggle or move your index finger for the first sound in the word, /a/.


  - Wiggle or move your middle finger for the second sound in the word, /t/.


  - Have students repeat after you.


**Note:** Now that you have reviewed oral blending and segmenting, it should
be embedded throughout the Code Flip Book Review to help students
decode new words. When students are ready, gradually reduce the support
you give for blending and segmenting.


  - Show students the /a/ Spelling Card with the ‘a’— _cat_ side facing students.
Point to the ‘a’ and ask students to name the letter. Then read the word _cat_
and remind them that the letter ‘a’ is used to spell and write /a/ in English
words. Remind students /a/ is a vowel sound; every word has at least one
vowel sound will always be written in green on the Spelling Cards because
when we say a vowel sound, we open our mouths, letting the air “go.”


  - Point out the power bar below the spelling ‘a’ and tell students that this bar
indicates how common each spelling is. If the card shows a very common
spelling for a sound, a spelling used in lots and lots of words, there will be a
long power bar on the card, stretching almost across the entire card. If the
card shows a less common spelling for the sound, a spelling used in a smaller
number of words, the card will have a shorter power bar.


  - Point to the power bar under the ‘a’ and ask students whether they think the
letter ‘a’ is a very common spelling or a less common spelling for /a/. (common)

 - Write the date with the month, day, and the year on the next line. This
practice over the course of the year will ensure that students learn to write
the date, using a comma correctly.


 - Remind the class that every letter can be written as an uppercase (or capital)
letter and a lowercase letter.


 - Tell students that you are going to show them how to write the lowercase
letter for the sound /a/. Have students repeat the sound /a/ after you.


 - Write a large lowercase ‘a’ on the handwriting guidelines and describe what
you are doing using the numbered instructions below.


 - Model drawing the same letter two or three more times in a row.


 - Have students trace the letter on the desk with a pointed finger.


 - Have students trace and copy lowercase ‘a’ on the activity page.


 - Encourage students to say the sound /a/ each time they write the letter.


 - Repeat the same steps for lowercase ‘p’, pointing out that it looks different
from lowercase ‘a’ and touches the bottom line of the handwriting guidelines.


 - Repeat the same steps for ‘n’, ‘c’, ‘g’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘t’, ‘d’, ‘m’, ‘f’, and ‘v’.

students to reinforce the sounds and spellings you have reviewed.


Foundational Skills 1


~~**POCKET CHART CHAINING FOR SPELLING (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Point to the spellings on the pocket chart you prepared in advance and have
students say the sounds.


 - Explain that you will combine spellings to make words.


 - Move the ‘f’, ‘o’, and ‘g’ cards to the center of the pocket chart to spell _fog_ .


 - Ask the class to read the word.


 - Remove the ‘o’ card and add the ‘i’ card and say, “If that is _fog_, what is this?”


 - Ask a student to read the word. ( _fig_ )


 - Ask students which sound or letter you changed in the word _fog_ to get the
word _fig_ . Ask them whether you changed the first, middle, or last sound or
letter. _(middle)_


 - Work through the remaining words.


**Note:** You may use the blending motions from today’s Warm-Up. The
spelling ‘o’ makes the /oe/ sound in Spanish (as opposed to the /o/ sound
in English). When you see the letter ‘o’ between two consonants in a onesyllable word it will make the /o/ sound.


1. fog > fig > fit > fat > vat > mat > pat > pot > cot > cat


2. vat > van > fan > fin > tin > tan > man > pan > pin > din


Check for Understanding


For each word in the chain, ask students to tell you how many sounds
are in each word by holding up their fingers. Additionally, you may
ask students to tell you where each sound change occurs from word
to word: at the beginning or at the end and with which letters.

    - Tell students that they are going to practice separating phonemes, or
single sounds, so they can spell words.

    - Say the word _cat_ .

    - Demonstrate for the students by pointing to one box for each phoneme and
saying the sound. Say the sound /c/ and push a marker in one box, say the
sound /a/ and push a marker in the second box, then say the sound /t/ and
push a marker in the third box.


Foundational Skills 1



**30**


   - Ask students how many phonemes there are in the word _cat_ and prompt
them to see why there are three phonemes.


   - Finally, trace your finger under the three boxes and say the sounds /c/ /a/
/t/. Explain that this is called blending.


   - Now tell students that we will practice using segmenting and blending to
help us learn to spell and read even more words.


 - Use any of these words to practice: _let_, _dig_, _cab_, _fox_, _nap_, _mat_, _rug_, _cut_, _pin_, _hop._


~~**MORE HELP WITH LETTER-SOUND CORRESPONDENCE**~~


**Tap the Spelling**

 - Make one copy of the game board for Tap the Spelling ( **Activity Page TR 1.2** )
for each pair of students.


 - Place the boards in a row on the floor or a table between pairs of children
who are facing each other.


 - Explain that you will say a number of words and that you want the students to tap
the correct spelling for the beginning sound of each word as quickly as possible.


 - Use the following words:



1. van


2. fin


3. tin



4. tip


5. flip


6. vent



7. vat


8. tap


9. fan



**Note:** You can play this game for all sounds reviewed in this unit. Choose
sounds that are similar, for example, /t/ and /d/.


~~**MORE HELP WITH READING AND SPELLING**~~


**Match the Word to the Picture**

  - Make one copy of **Activity Page TR 1.3** for each student.


  - Have students read the CVC words at the top of the page, locate the
corresponding picture below, and write the word on the lines provided.


**Large Card Spelling**

  - Distribute the following **Large Letter Cards** to students, one card per
student: **‘a’, ‘i’, ‘e’, ‘o’, ‘u’, ‘v’, ‘c’, ‘d’, ‘f’, ‘t’, ‘g’, ‘m’, ’n’, ‘p’.**


  - Explain that you will say the sounds of a word and that you want the students
with the Large Letter Cards for those sounds to stand next to each other to
spell the word.


Lesson 1 Review: Back-to-School
**31**


- Say the word _pot_ in a segmented fashion: /p/ /o/ /t/.


- Ask the class to blend the word.


- Have students with the Large Letter Cards for ‘p’, ‘o’, and ‘t’ line up to spell
the word.


- Have the class segment the word by saying the individual sounds. As they
are saying the individual sounds, the student with the spelling for that sound
should step forward.



1. pet


2. tap


3. men


4. mat


5. cot



6. fin


7. got


8. fun


9. dim


10. cup



**32**



~~**PROGRESS MONITORING (OPTIONAL)**~~


 - Make one copy of the Word Cards for Progress Monitoring 1 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 1.4** ). Cut apart the word cards.


 - Make one copy of the Record Sheet for Progress Monitoring 1 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 1.5** ) for each student you are assessing.


 - Working one-on-one with each student, model with the sample word.


 - Show the cards to the student one at a time. Use the Record Sheet to record
each word as the student reads.


 - Place a check next to each word read correctly.


 - For misread words, write exactly what students say as the word is sounded
out. If students misread a word, prompt them to try to read the word again,
letting them know their first attempt was incorrect.


 - Students may benefit from the supports utilized during instruction such
as blending motions and representing sounds with objects (e.g., Push
and Say, **Activity Page TR 1.6** ). Demonstrate and encourage their use
during modeling with the sample item if needed. The goal is for students to
eventually be capable of completing the task without physical supports or, at
least, utilizing the supports independently (without your prompt).


**Scoring:** Scoring is based on one point assigned for every sound/spelling in
a word that is read correctly. Interpret scores as follows:


Foundational Skills 1


    - 14 or 15 points—excellent


    - 11–13 points—good


    - 8–10 points—fair


    - Less than 8 points—poor


**Goal:** Achieve scores of good or excellent (11 points or higher).


Scores of 10 or less indicate additional reteaching and reinforcement is required.


Further analyze student errors to determine whether there are one or more
particularly problematic sound/spellings. The subtotals for targeted sound/
spellings at the bottom of the Record Sheet facilitate the identification of
specific problem areas.


Also examine whether there are mispronunciations occurring more
frequently in a given position in words. For example, does the student read
the initial sound correctly, but misread the medial and/or final sound?


Finally, examine whether the student succeeded in reading words correctly
on the second attempt. If so, the student may be rushing and may benefit
from explicit instruction to slow down and look at each letter in a word
sequentially, left to right.


**Code Knowledge**


Before today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
111 and 146 of those words would be completely decodable.


After today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
114 and 157 of those words would be completely decodable.


Students have now reviewed one way to write 12 of the 44 sounds in English.


The sound /f/ is the 22 [nd] most common sound in English and it is found in approximately
10 percent of English words.


The sound /f/ is spelled ‘f’ approximately 82 percent of the time.


The sound /v/ is the 19 [th] most common sound in English and it is found in approximately
8 percent of English words.


The sound /v/ is spelled ‘v’ approximately 94 percent of the time.


The sound /m/ is the 14 [th] most common sound in English and it is found in
approximately 17 percent of English words.


The sound /m/ is spelled ‘m’ approximately 94 percent of the time.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


In this lesson, you will review two sets of sounds that are very similar and are
sometimes confusing for students: (1) /s/ as in _sip_ and /z/ as in _zip_ ; (2) /f/
as in _fan_ and /v/ as in _van_ . The sounds /s/ and /z/ are made with the same
mouth position; the only difference is that /s/ is unvoiced and /z/ is voiced
(buzzy sounding). The same is true of /f/ and /v/; both sounds are made
with the same mouth position, but /f/ is unvoiced and /v/ is voiced.


**Foundational Skills**

 - Display the Consonant Code Flip Book within view of all students; also have the
Spelling Cards listed in the Materials section of the Lesson at a Glance readily
available.


 - Use this routine when teaching one-syllable spoken words and before using
letter cards.


 - Say, “You are going to practice blending and segmenting sounds in words. For
example, the sounds /k/ /a/ /t/ can be blended to say _cat_, and _cat_ can be
segmented into /k/ /a/ /t/.”


 - Say the word _slip_ . Follow the routine above to blend and segment the word.
Point out that the first two sounds, /s/ and /l/, blend together to make the
‘sl’ sound. Have students say the ‘sl’ sound and notice how it feels on their
tongues.


 - Say the following words: _trip_, _brunch_ . Have students identify the blends and
whether they are at the beginning or end of the words. Then have them blend
and segment the phonemes using motions from the program.

Point to the ‘e’ and ask students to name the letter. Read the word _pet_ and
remind them that the letter ‘e’ is used to spell and write /e/ in English words.
Remind students that /e/ is a vowel sound; vowel sounds will always be
written in green on the Spelling Cards because when we say a vowel sound,
we open our mouths, letting the air “go.”

For blending


For segmenting


Support


The finger taps represent
sounds. Tapping helps
students hear and
distinguish individual
sounds. When students
are ready, gradually reduce
the support for blending
and segmenting.


By the end of this unit
(if not earlier), you should
provide only the visual
support for blending and
segmenting, and not blend
and segment the words for
students.


**38**



**Oral Blending**

 - Say _pet_ in a segmented fashion, marking each sound with a thumb-finger tap.
Start with a thumb-forefinger tap.


 - The finger taps represent sounds. Tapping helps students hear and
distinguish individual sounds.


 - Blend the sounds to produce the word _pet_, making a fist with your hand.


 - Have students tap and blend the sounds in the word.


**Oral Segmenting**

 - Hold up three fingers and say the word _pet_ .


 - Have students repeat the word after you.


 - Wiggle or move your index finger for the first sound in the word, /p/, wiggle
or move your middle finger for the second sound in the word, /e/, and wiggle
or move your ring finger for the third sound in the word, /t/.


 - Have students repeat after you.


 - Point out the power bar below the spelling ‘e’ and remind students that this
bar indicates how common each spelling is. If the card shows a very common
spelling for a sound, a spelling used in many words, there will be a long power
bar on the card, stretching almost across the entire card. If the card shows a
less common spelling for this sound, a spelling used in a smaller number of
words, the card will have a shorter power bar.


 - Point to the power bar under ‘e’ and ask the students whether they think the
letter ‘e’ is a very common spelling or a less common spelling for /e/.


 - Turn to **Vowel Code Flip Book page 3** and point to the sound bubble for /e/
on the page, and then point to the outline for the Spelling Card, placing the ‘e’
Spelling Card for /e/ on the appropriate place on the Code Flip Book page.


 - Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart page 1** . Have them locate and
trace the card outline and code information for /e/ > ‘e’ in green marker.


 - Repeat the above steps with the Spelling Card for /u/. Remind students to also
trace the card outline for these vowel sounds in green marker in their Individual
Code Charts. The spellings can be found on the following pages in the **Vowel**
**Code Flip Book (page 4)** and in students’ **Individual** **Code Chart (page 1)** .


**Code Flip: Consonant Review**

 - Show students the /s/ Spelling Card with the ‘s’— _sun_ side facing students.
Point to the ‘s’ and ask students to name the letter. Then read the word _sun_ and
remind them that the letter ‘s’ is used to spell and write ‘s’ in English words.


Foundational Skills 1


  - Quickly review the power bar for the consonant /s/.


  - Turn to **Consonant Code Flip Book page 11** and point to the sound bubble
for /s/ on the page, and then point to the outline for the Spelling Card,
placing the ‘s’ Spelling Card for /s/ on the appropriate place on the page.


  - Ask students to turn to **Individual Code Chart page 8** and outline the card
and code knowledge for /s/ > ‘s’ ( _sun_ ) with their red markers.


  - Quickly review consonant Spelling Cards ‘z,’ ‘h,’ ‘b,’ ‘l,’ ‘w,’ and r.’


**Consonant Code Flip Book**


1. /z/ > ‘z’ ( _zip_ ) (page 12)


2. /h/ > ‘h’ ( _hot_ ) (page 20)


3. /r/ > ‘r’ (red) (page 18)


4. /l/ > ‘l’ (lip) (page 19)


5. /w/ > ‘w’ (wet) (page 21)


**Note:** The ‘z’ and ‘h’ spellings are not included on the Individual Code Chart.


**Code Flip: Double-Letter Consonants**


**Note:** Double-letter consonant spellings are covered more in depth in Lesson 11.


  - Tell students that many consonant sounds can be written with either a single
letter or with two of the same letter.


  - Write the letter ‘f’ on the board/chart paper.


  - Ask students what sound the letter ‘f’ stands for. ( _They should say /f/_ .)


  - Write the spelling ‘ff’ on the board/chart paper.


  - Tell students that this spelling is another way to write the /f/ sound.


**Oral Blending**

  - Say _stuff_ in a segmented fashion, marking each sound with a thumb-finger
tap. Start with a thumb-forefinger tap.


  - Blend the sounds to produce the word _stuff_, making a fist with your hand.


  - Have students tap and blend the sounds in the word.


Lesson 2 Review: Back-to-School
**39**


**40**



**Oral Segmenting**

 - Hold up four fingers and say the word _stuff_ .


 - Have students repeat the word after you.


 - Wiggle or move your index finger for the first sound in the word, /s/, wiggle
or move your middle finger for the second sound in the word, /t/, wiggle or
move your ring finger for the third sound in the word, /u/, and wiggle or move
your little finger for the fourth sound in the word, /ff/.


 - Have students repeat after you.


 - Write the words _fit_ and _stuff_ on the board/chart paper. Point out that in the
word _fit_, the /f/ sound is written with the spelling ‘f’. In the word _stuff_, the /f/
sound is written with the double-letter spelling ‘ff’.


 - Show students the /f/ Spelling Card with the ‘ff’— _stuff_ side facing students.
Point to the ‘ff’ and remind them that the letters ‘ff’ are used to spell and
write the /f/ sound in English words.


 - Point out the power bar below the spelling ‘ff’ and remind students that this
bar indicates how common each spelling is. Point out it is a less common
spelling.


 - Turn to **Consonant Code Flip Book page 9** and point to the sound bubble
for /f/ on the page, and then point to the outline for the ‘ff’ Spelling Card,
placing the ‘ff’ Spelling Card for /f/ on the appropriate place on the page.


 - **Note:** The ‘ff’ spelling is not included on the Individual Code Chart.


 - Repeat the steps for /s/ > ‘ss’ (dress) and /z/ > ‘zz’ (buzz) using **Consonant**
**Code Flip Book pages 11 and 12** .


Foundational Skills 1


~~**REVIEW SPELLINGS (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Distribute Activity Page 2.1.


 - Remind the class that every letter can be written as an uppercase (or capital)
letter and a lowercase letter.


 - Tell students that you are going to show them how to write the lowercase
letter for the sound /f/. Have students repeat the sound /f/ after you.


 - Write a large lowercase ‘f’ on the handwriting guidelines and describe what
you are doing using the numbered instructions below.


 - Model drawing the same letter two or three more times in a row.


 - Have students trace the letter on the desk with a pointed finger.


 - Have students trace and copy lowercase ‘f’ on the activity page.


 - Encourage students to say the sound /f/ each time they write the letter.


 - Repeat the same steps for lowercase ‘b’, pointing out that it looks different from
lowercase ‘f’ and mostly touches the bottom line of the handwriting guidelines.


 - Repeat the same steps for ‘s,’ ‘z,’ ‘h,’ ‘w,’ ‘e,’ ‘u,’ and ‘r.’


**Note:** Uppercase letters will be covered in future lessons. Model drawing the
letter two or three more times.

**42**



**Note:** The spelling ‘h’ is silent in Spanish (unlike in the English word _hot_ ).
When we see the spelling ‘h’ we make the /h/ sound. To make the sound
open your mouth and push air from the back of your throat without vibration.


~~**SISTER SOUNDS (10 MIN.)**~~


Activity Page 2.2 **Note:** Please note that this is an oral exercise. As some of the words are not
yet decodable, you do not need to write them on the board/chart paper.


Foundational Skills 1


- Distribute Activity Page 2.2.


- Explain that the activity pages show the lowercase letters of the following
sounds: /s/, /z/, /f/, and /v/.


- Explain that the sounds /s/ and /z/ are very similar, so we call them sister
sounds. The only difference between them is that /z/ is buzzy and makes the
vocal cords vibrate.


- Tell students that you want them to show you the spelling for /s/ when you
say the /s/ sound and the spelling for /z/ when you say the /z/ sound.


- Make the /s/ sound, and have students show you the side of the activity page
with ‘s’ on it. Do the same for the /z/ sound. Practice this several times.


- Next, tell students that you will be reading three-sound words that begin with
/s/ or /z/.


- Tell students that you want them to show you the spelling for /s/ when you
say a word that begins with the /s/ sound and the spelling for /z/ when you
say a word that contains the /z/ sound.


- Work through words 1–9 in the box that follows.


- Have students repeat each word to hear and feel the difference in
articulation.


- If there is time, repeat this process for the sounds /f/ and /v/ (words 10–18).



13. fast (f)


14. fetch (f)


15. verb (v)


16. view (v)


17. fall (f)

Check for Understanding


Observe students’ performance as they hold up letters during the
Sister Sounds activity. Note which students are having difficulty
differentiating between the sounds.

Pocket Chart Setup



~~**TRICKY WORDS: OF, IS, TO, ALL, SOME (10 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** If you have created a Tricky Word Wall, you may direct students’
attention to this area to review previously taught Tricky Words. Remind
students that the yellow cards mean they should proceed with caution when
reading the words.


 - Tell students that they will learn five new Tricky Words today. Ask students,
“What does it mean if we say something is a Tricky Word?” _(The word does not_
_“play by the rules” and is pronounced differently from what they might expect.)_


**Tricky Word: Of**

 - Write the word _of_ on the board/chart paper. Ask students how they would
pronounce it by blending. (They might say /o/ /f/ as in _off_ .)


 - Explain that this word is actually pronounced /u/ /v/ as in, “He has a bag of
chips.”


 - Underline the letter ‘o’ and explain that it is a tricky part of the word. They would
probably expect this letter to be pronounced /o/, but it is pronounced /u/.


 - Underline the letter ‘f’ and explain that it is also a tricky part of the word.
They would probably expect this letter to be pronounced /f/, but it is
pronounced /v/.


 - Tell students that when reading _of_, they have to remember to pronounce the
letter ‘o’ as /u/ and the letter ‘f’ as /v/.


 - Tell students that when writing _of_, they have to remember to spell the /u/
sound with the letter ‘o’ and the /v/ sound with the letter ‘f’.


 - Point to the word _of_ as you say the following sentence, “I like a lot of songs.”
Ask students to **Turn and Talk**, using the word _of_ in an oral sentence.


 - Write the Tricky Word _of_ on a yellow card and add it to the Tricky Word Wall.


**Tricky Word: Is**


**Note:** Some students may know that ‘s’ is also a spelling for /z/, as this was
taught in Kindergarten. For these students, the word _is_ is really not a Tricky
Word, but it is a high-frequency word.


 - Write the Tricky Word _is_ on the board/chart paper. Ask students how they
would pronounce this word by blending. (They might say /i/ /s/.)


 - Explain that this word is generally pronounced /i/ /z/ as in, “ _Is_ this true?”


 - Point to the letter ‘i’ and explain that this is pronounced as they would expect,
as /i/.


Foundational Skills 1











**44**


  - Underline the letter ‘s’ and explain that this is the tricky part of the word. They
would probably expect this letter to be pronounced /s/, but it is pronounced /z/.


  - Tell students that when reading _is_, they have to remember to pronounce it as
/i/ /z/.


  - Tell students that when writing _is_, they have to remember to spell the sound
/z/ with the letter ‘s’.


  - Point to the word _is_ as you say the following sentence, “The apple is green.” Ask
students to **Turn and Talk**, using the word _is_ in an oral sentence.


  - Write the Tricky Word _is_ on a yellow card and add it to the Tricky Word Wall.


**Tricky Word: To**

  - Write the Tricky Word _to_ on the board/chart paper. Ask students how they
would pronounce the word by blending. (They might say /t/ /o/ as in _tah_ .)


  - Explain that this word is actually pronounced /t/ /oo/ as in, “Do you want to
play tag?”


  - Point to the letter ‘t’ and explain that it is pronounced /t/ as they would expect.


  - Underline the letter ‘o’ and explain that it is the tricky part of the word. They would
probably expect this letter to be pronounced /o/, but it is pronounced /oo/.


  - Tell students that when reading _to_, they have to remember to pronounce the
letter ‘o’ as /oo/.


  - Tell students that when writing _to_, they have to remember to spell the /oo/
sound with the letter ‘o’.


  - Point to the word _to_ as you say the following sentence, “I am going to the park.”
Ask students to **Turn and Talk**, using the word _to_ in an oral sentence.


  - Write the Tricky Word _to_ on a yellow card and add it to the Tricky Word Wall.


**Tricky Word: All**

  - Write the word _all_ on the board/chart paper and ask students how they would
pronounce it by blending. (They might say /a/ /l/ as in the name _Albert_ or
they might try to say the /l/ sound twice.)


  - Explain that this word is actually pronounced /o/ /l/ as in, “He has all of my books.”


  - Underline the letter ‘a’ and explain that it is a tricky part of the word. They would
probably expect this letter to be pronounced /a/, but it is pronounced /o/.


  - Point to the letters ‘l’ and ‘l’ and explain that this part of the word is only
slightly tricky. Even though the letter ‘l’ appears twice, there is only one /l/
sound in this word.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


During this lesson, students will review the digraphs ‘ch’ and ‘sh’. The term
_digraph_ refers to two letters that stand for a single sound. Students do not
need to know the term _digraph_, but it is crucial that they understand that a
letter can stand for a single sound all by itself or it can work with a second
letter as part of a “letter team,” where two letters represent a single sound.


**Foundational Skills**


 - Display the Consonant Code Flip Book within view of all students; also have
the Spelling Cards listed in the Lesson at a Glance chart readily available for
Code Flip book Review.


 - Create pocket chart cards by writing each of the following letters on a
separate white index card: ‘e,’ ‘u,’ ‘j,’ ‘y,’ ‘x,’ ‘k,’ ‘ch,’ and ‘sh.’ Using these cards,
set up the pocket chart as shown.


 - Use this routine when teaching one-syllable spoken words and before using
letter cards.


 - Say, “You are going to practice blending and segmenting sounds in words. For
example, the sounds /p/ /i/ /g/ can be blended to say _pig_, and _pig_ can be
segmented into /p/ /i/ /g/.”


 - Say the word _stand_ . Follow the routine above to blend and segment the word.
Point out that the final two sounds, /n/ and /d/, blend together to make the
‘nd’ sound. Have students say the ‘nd’ sound and notice how it feels on their
tongues.


 - Say the following words: _best_, _camp_ . Have students identify the blends and
whether they are at the beginning or end of the words. Then have them blend
and segment the phonemes using motions from the program.

person or a thing. _(noun)_


~~**REVIEW SPELLINGS (10 MIN.)**~~


**Note to Teacher:** In Lesson 1, students reviewed the spelling ‘c’ for the /k/
sound. Today they will review an alternative spelling for the /k/ sound, ‘k’.
At this point, students should not be expected to know whether ‘c’ or ‘k’ is
the correct spelling for /k/ in words that contain that sound. They will learn
when to use ‘c’ and when to use ‘k’ gradually, as they get more exposure to
printed words. Please note that /x/ consists of two sounds, /k/ and /s/. It is
reviewed here as if it were one sound because it is often written with a single
letter, ‘x’. There is no need to explain this to the class. If a student notices
that /x/ consists of two sounds, you can confirm this and compliment the
student for being a good listener.


~~**REVIEW DIGRAPHS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Draw a square, a triangle, and a house (triangle on top of square) in a row on
the board/chart paper.


  - Point to each shape and ask students what it is. _(a square, a triangle, and_
_a house)_

 - Explain that a square by itself is just a square, and a triangle by itself is just
a triangle, but a square with a triangle on top of it is something completely
different: a house.


 - Write a ‘c’ on the board/chart paper underneath the square.


 - Ask students what sound the letter ‘c’ stands for. _(They should say /k/.)_


 - Write an ‘h’ on the board/chart paper underneath the triangle.


 - Ask students what sound the letter ‘h’ stands for. _(They should say /h/.)_


 - Write the spelling ‘ch’ on the board/chart paper underneath the house.


 - Ask students what sound the spelling ‘ch’ stands for. _(They should say /ch/.)_


 - Explain that the letter ‘c’ by itself stands for the /k/ sound, and the letter ‘h’
by itself stands for the /h/ sound, but the letters ‘c’ and ‘h’ written together
stand for a completely different sound: the /ch/ sound.


 - Repeat this procedure for the digraph ‘sh’ as in _ship_ .

Foundational Skills


**Foundational Literacy Skills**


To demonstrate the
meaning of the words
_to_ and _two,_ first show
students an item such
as a marker. Hold up the
marker and say, “This
is one marker.” Hold up
another marker and
continue, “One marker
and another marker
makes two markers. We
write the number two,
t-w-o.” (Write _two_ on
the board/chart paper.)
Then have a student help
you demonstrate the
preposition _to_ by asking
him/her to walk from
“the desk to the door,” or
having the student move
from “there to here.” Say,
“We write the word _to_,
t-o.”(Write the word _to_ on
the board/chart paper.)
Have students compare the
spelling of the two words.



Lesson 3 Review: Basic Code, Nouns, and Tricky Words
**63**


Pocket Chart Setup




 - Tell students that when writing _two_, they have to remember to spell the word
‘t’, ‘w’, ‘o’.


 - Tell students that the words _two_ and _to_ are homonyms, words that sound the
same but are spelled differently and have different meanings.


 - Point to the word _two_ as you say the sentence, “The Davis family has two
cars.” Ask students to **Turn and Talk**, using the word _two_ in oral sentences.


~~**TRICKY WORD PRACTICE (10 MIN.)**~~


**Small Group**

 - Distribute Activity Page 3.2.


 - Have students read the Tricky Words in the box at the top of the page.


 - Ask students if any of them can read the first sentence.


 - Have students find the Tricky Word that fits in the sentence. Read the first
sentence with the Tricky Word _are_ .


 - Have students write the Tricky Word on the provided line, following your
example.


 - Read the rest of the sentences as a class before breaking into small groups.


**Group 1:** Ask students who are able to do independent work to complete the
activity page on their own. Once they have worked through the sentences,
they may write an original sentence containing one of the Tricky Words.


**Group 2:** Have students who need more support work with you to complete
the activity page.


~~**POCKET CHART CHAINING FOR SPELLING (10 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** There are several ways you can conduct this chaining exercise. You
may have students sit in front of the chart and participate as a class. If you
have individual whiteboards, students may sit at their desks, write the letters
on their boards, and show you their answers. If you have students write
down their answers, you may have them work individually or in pairs/groups.
You may also time and record how long it takes to complete a chain, and
challenge students to beat their score next time. The key is to move quickly
and keep the activity upbeat.


 - Point to the spellings on the pocket chart you prepared in advance and have
students say the sounds.


Foundational Skills 1



**64**


- Tell the class you are going to ask them to spell a mix of real words and silly
words. Explain that students should spell the silly words just as they spell real
words: by breaking the silly word up into sounds and selecting a spelling for
each sound.


- Say the word _jut_ loudly and slowly, repeating it if necessary.


- Ask the class for the first sound in _jut_ .


- Select a student to come to the pocket chart and move the spelling for /j/ to
the center of the pocket chart.

word _just_ .


- Work through the remaining words and silly words.


1. jut > just > jest > jet > yet > yes > yem > yam > jam > jag > jig


2. skim > skip > sip > six > mix > max > tax > tag > tap > tip


Check for Understanding


Monitor students’ performance as they move from one word to
the next.

in a word that is read correctly. Interpret scores as follows:


   - 18–20 points: excellent


   - 16 or 17 points: good


   - 12–15 points: fair


   - Less than 12 points: poor


**Goal:** Achieve scores of good or excellent (16 points or higher).


Foundational Skills 1

Assessment Overview


~~**IMPORTANCE OF ASSESSMENTS**~~


The focus of Lessons 4 through 8 is to gauge students’ reading abilities
through a number of assessments. **Taking time to assess students at**
**the start of the year is crucial in ensuring their success as readers**
**in Grade 1.** The assessments help you determine which students have
the knowledge and skills needed to profit from Grade 1 Skills instruction
and which students need to be regrouped to an earlier point in the Skills
program. The assessments can also help you determine which students are
ready to read trade books independently. Warm-Ups are left out this week in
order to maximize the amount of time you have to assess students. Details
about how to interpret students’ scores for placement are provided in the
Placement Overview section of this Teacher Guide.


~~**KINDERGARTEN EXPERIENCE**~~


To accurately place students in reading groups, it is helpful to have a basic
overview of the Kindergarten program. Students who did well in Kindergarten
should be ready for the Grade 1 sequence of Skills instruction. In general,
students who mastered Kindergarten learned:


  - One-to-one letter-sound correspondences: CVC words with short vowel
sounds, like _cat_, _dog_, and _bed_


  - Consonant clusters: CCVC words like _flag_, CVCC words like _dust_, CCVCC
words like _blast_


  - Consonant sounds written with digraph spellings: ‘sh’, ‘ch’, ‘th’, ‘ng’


  - Tricky Words, such as _the_ and _I_


  - Double-letter spellings like ‘ss’, ‘ff’, ‘ck’


  - In the last unit of Kindergarten, students learned the basic code spelling for
the long vowel sounds: /ee/ spelled ‘ee’, ‘ae’ spelled ‘a_e’, /oe/ spelled ‘o_e’,
/ ie/ spelled ‘i_e’, and /ue/ spelled ‘u_e’.


**Note:** Not all students who participated in the Kindergarten sequence will
have completed the last unit, but they may still be prepared for Grade 1
materials. In general, students who mastered Kindergarten material from:


Foundational Skills 1


 - Units 1–8 should have adequate preparation for the Grade 1 sequence of
Skills instruction.


 - Units 9–10 should have good to outstanding preparation.

**72**



A flow chart has been provided on the following pages to help you visualize
the order of assessments. In addition, a Placement Planning Sheet is
provided in the Teacher Resources section of this Teacher Guide to record
students’ scores.


~~**MANAGING THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ASSESSMENTS**~~


Both the Word Recognition and Independent Story Reading Assessments are
administered as group assessments. The Pseudoword Reading Assessment
and Code Knowledge Diagnostic Assessment are administered individually.


Foundational Skills 1


The Letter Name Assessment can be administered individually or as a group.


Activity pages are provided for students to complete independently while
others are being assessed. They are intentionally created to be easy
for students to complete without direct teacher guidance. You can also
incorporate other independent activities that are routine in your classroom,
such as looking at trade books, working at a listening station, or writing
in journals.


The important thing is for students to be engaged in activities that will allow
you to maintain a calm atmosphere conducive to assessment. Decide on the
procedure you will implement for providing and explaining the activity pages
and other independent activities to students so things can run smoothly
during this time.


In Lesson 6, the Word Recognition Assessment is administered to the entire
class at the same time. Activity pages are provided for independent work
during the remainder of the class period. In Lesson 5, the Story Reading
Assessment is administered as a group assessment, but only to those
students who scored 18 or more on the Word Recognition Assessment.
Students who are not eligible for the Story Reading Assessment should work
independently on the activity pages provided, as the teacher then calls each
student individually to complete the indicated one-on-one assessments
during Lesson 5 and the remainder of the week.


~~**SCORING AND PLACEMENT**~~


In each lesson, there is information in the Scoring and Analysis section about
how to evaluate students’ assessments. The Scoring and Analysis section
also tells you which students will take the next assessments. After Lesson
10, information is provided in the Placement Overview section that will guide
how to place students in appropriate reading groups.


**If the placement assessments indicate that a student is not ready for**
**Grade 1, it is imperative that the student be regrouped to get Skills**
**instruction that matches his or her reading ability.**

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


Today’s assessment is the Word Recognition Assessment, and it will be
administered to your entire class. It is designed to provide you with a quick
overview of students’ ability to recognize words that contain spellings taught
in the Kindergarten program. Depending on your class, this may take around
20–30 minutes.


Following the group administration of the Word Recognition Assessment,
allow students to spend the remainder of the class reading the activity
page stories from the Kindergarten level. Four stories from Kindergarten
are provided for students to read post-assessment; you may choose to have
students read this with partners or in small groups. Feel free to add other
independent activities for students, including trade books, journals, or other
activities that can be completed independently. This will permit you to use
class time to score the Word Recognition Assessment while students work
independently.


You should aim to score students’ assessments as soon as possible in order
to determine which assessment each student will take during the next
lesson. You may record students’ scores on the Placement Planning Sheet
copied from Teacher Resources.


**Assessment**

 - Copy the Placement Planning Sheet from the Teacher Resources.


 - Please note that today’s assessment consists of two activity pages; one
activity page has the words for students to circle, while the other is a sheet to
record students’ scores. Depending on your classroom routine, you may want
to staple these activity pages together before the assessment or right at the
beginning of the lesson.

  - Tell students that for this activity, they must listen very carefully to you. For
each number, you will say one word. They must find the word in that row and
circle it.


  - Say, “Find the first row of words. Listen carefully to this word: _mat_ . I will say
the word again: _mat_ . Now find the word that you heard and circle it.” You may
repeat the word up to three times.


  - Proceed with the rest of the words listed below, repeating each word at least
twice.

Lesson 4 Placement Assessment: Word Recognition
**79**


**Scoring and Analysis**


Score items 1–20. Take note of specific errors. Mark each student’s score on
the Placement Planning Sheet.


**Note:** Items 21–25 are Tricky Words, and they should not be counted as part
of the student’s score.


Students who scored **18 out of 20 (90%)** or above have strong word
recognition skills and are making good progress. They will take the
**Independent Story Reading Assessment: “Gwen’s Hens,”** in Lesson 7.


Students who **scored 17 or less** should be assessed one-on-one with the
**Pseudoword Reading Assessment** .


**Record separately errors for ANY Tricky Words. If time permits, ask**
**students who missed 3 or more in items 21–25 to read all of these**
**words aloud to you one-on-one. Make note of any Tricky Words that are**
**misread.**

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


Students who received a score of **18 or more** on the Word Recognition
Assessment will read and answer questions about the story “Gwen’s Hens.”
It is recommended that you start first with this group of students, providing
directions for reading the story and answering questions. Tell them to begin
independent work using Activity Pages 5.6–5.8 once they have completed
the Story Reading Assessment.


Direct the students who received a score of **17 or less** on the Word
Recognition Assessment to begin work on Activity Pages 5.9 and 5.10. Once
you have finished giving directions for completion of “Gwen’s Hens” to the
other group of students, pull one student at a time from this group so you
can administer the Pseudoword Reading Assessment one-on-one. With the
Pseudoword Reading Assessment, students can only read the words if they
know the sound/spelling correspondences and how to blend them together.
The following is the Order of Assessments chart shared in the Assessment
Overview section that shows the progression of one-on-one assessments:

**Administration**

 - Help students tear out Activity Pages 5.1 and 5.2. Explain that they will read
the story on Activity Page 5.1 and answer questions on Activity Page 5.2.


 - Encourage students to look back to the story if they need help answering the
questions.


 - Tell students that when they finish reading the story and answering the
questions, they should read the stories on Activity Pages 5.6 and 5.7. They
may draw a picture and write a sentence about the story they have read.
They may also complete Activity Page 5.8.


**Scoring and Analysis**


If students have a score of **3 or less**, work with them one-on-one during the
next lesson as time permits. Students will read the story aloud to you and
answer the questions you ask orally.


If students have a score of **4 or more**, they are done with the assessments.


Mark students’ scores on the Placement Planning Sheet.


~~**PSEUDOWORD READING ASSESSMENT**~~


**Administration**

 - Turn to the Teacher Resources section to find the Pseudoword Reading
Assessment. You will place this copy in front of the student to read. Provide the
student with a blank sheet of paper to help him or her keep track of each row.


 - Ask the student to bring their Activity Book and sit with you in a quiet spot in
your classroom.


Foundational Skills 1



**84**


 - Find Activity Page 5.3 for the Pseudoword Reading Assessment Scoring
Sheet. You will use this to record the student’s score and make note of errors.


 - Tell the student that he or she will read some silly words (or nonsense
words). Make sure the student understands that these are not real words, but
they can be read just like real words by blending sounds.


 - Place the Pseudoword Reading Assessment in front of the student. Ask the
student to read the words on lines 1 through 6.


 - As the student reads, circle the words that are read incorrectly on Activity
Page 5.3. Note the type of error; for example, if the student read _rab_ as _rad_,
you would cross out the ‘b’ and write a ‘d’ above it.


**Note:** Asking students to read pseudowords is the purest test of a student’s
code knowledge in segmenting and blending words because students can
neither rely on having encountered the word previously nor guessing on
the basis of meaning. Occasionally some students may be confused by the
concept of _silly_ or _nonsense_ and may perform poorly for that reason. If you
suspect that this may be the case with a given student, you may choose
instead to ask the student to read aloud thirty comparable words from lines
1–20 of the Word Recognition Assessment.


**Scoring and Analysis**


Students who scored **27 or more** should take the Independent Story Reading
Assessment: “Gwen’s Hens.”


Students who scored **26 or less** should be given the Code Knowledge
Diagnostic Assessment at some point this week.


Mark students’ scores on the Placement Planning Sheet.


~~**CODE KNOWLEDGE DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT**~~


**Note:** Please use your judgment as to how many assessments can be
administered to a single student at a time. If a student grows quickly
frustrated, you may wish to break the assessments up over the next few
days. If a student seems pleased to be working one-on-one and shows no
signs of frustration, you may continue with the assessments as needed.
**Remember that taking the time this week to thoroughly assess**
**students is crucial in determining where they should be placed in the**
**sequence.**

your classroom.


 - Tear out the student’s Activity Page 5.4. You will use this to record the
student’s score and make note of errors.


 - Point to the first sound/spelling (or letter) on the Code Knowledge Diagnostic
Assessment and ask the student, “What sound would you say if you saw this
in a word?”


 - If the student replies with a letter name, say, “That’s the letter name. What
sound does this stand for?” If the student continues to offer the letter name,
transcribe the response and mark the item incorrect.


 - Repeat with the remaining items.


 - As the student says the sounds, use Activity Page 5.4 to record all spellings
for which the student is unable to give a correct pronunciation. Note the
exact nature of each error. For example, note if the student gets ‘b’ and ‘d’
confused.


**Note:** Some of the spellings shown can stand for more than one sound: ‘th’
stands for /th/ as in _thin_ and /th/ as in _them_ ; the spelling ‘s’ stands for /s/
as in _sun_ and /z/ as in _dogs_ . For ‘th’ you can accept either /th/ or /th/, but
expect /s/ for ‘s’.


**Scoring and Analysis**


Students scoring **23 or more** need no further assessment.


Students scoring **22 or less** can take the Letter Name Assessment, if time
permits. However, this is optional.


Mark students’ scores on the Placement Planning Sheet.

Placement Overview


~~**MOVING FORWARD WITH UNIT 1 LESSONS**~~


It will likely take some time for you to fully score, record, and analyze
assessment data for all students. Unit 1 is deliberately planned as a review of
Kindergarten skills, so no new Grade 1 skills are introduced. Following Lesson
8, which marks the end of the initial assessment period, you should continue
Unit 1 instruction, carrying on with Lesson 9.


Guidance is provided here for a thorough analysis of the assessment data;
**you should complete this analysis for each student well before the**
**end of Unit 1 instruction.** This analysis will then inform decisions as to
whether students are ready to continue with Grade 1, Unit 2 instruction
or whether other instruction is needed to ensure mastery of skills taught
at the Kindergarten level. Students may lack these skills for a variety of
reasons, including being new to the program, perhaps having used different
approaches and/or instructional materials in Kindergarten, difficulty
in thoroughly mastering these skills in spite of having participated in
Kindergarten instruction, and so on. Whatever the reason, it is important
to identify code knowledge gaps now and address them rather than simply
pushing students ahead through the Grade 1 materials.


~~**MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS OF ASSESSMENTS**~~


You will want to conduct an analysis of each student’s performance on the
various assessments using different filters or lenses. It is recommended that
you look first at each student’s overall performance on these assessments
for guidance as to whether a given student has the prerequisite skills needed
to profit from Grade 1 instruction with standard pacing. As noted above,
Unit 1 of Grade 1 provides a rapid review of all of the short vowel lettersound correspondences as well as the various consonant letter-sound
correspondences taught in Units 1–9 of Kindergarten. All students, including
those who performed well in Kindergarten, will benefit from this review.
However, due to the fact that nine units of instruction that spanned nearly
a year in Kindergarten are reviewed in a single unit in Grade 1, the review
is fast-paced. Students with low overall scores and performance on the
assessments will profit from additional teaching of Kindergarten skills.


Lessons 6–8 Placement Assessment: Individual Assessments
**97**


**98**



~~**INTERPRETING STUDENT SKILLS SCORES FOR SKILLS PLACEMENT**~~


Once you have administered and scored all assessments, enter students’
scores on the Placement Planning Sheet—Unit 1 (located in Teacher
Resources). Consideration of these scores is critical in determining what
Skills instruction students need and how to group students to facilitate the
best delivery of this instruction.


Use the Placement and Grouping Chart from the next page to complete the
final “Group” column for each student on Placement Planning Sheet—Unit 1.


**It is highly recommended that all Grade 1 teachers meet as a grade-**
**level team to examine students’ scores across the entire grade level,**
**rather than having each teacher examine only the scores of students**
**in his or her own classroom** . Homogeneous grouping for Skills instruction
is the most efficient and effective way to differentiate instruction and meet
students’ needs when teaching phonics skills. Once the grade-level team
has examined the scores of all students on these assessments, you may find
that it makes sense to regroup some students on the basis of their specific
decoding skills for purposes of Skills instruction only.


**Note:** The Skills assessments and placement recommendations should
be used only in grouping students for instruction during the Skills Strand.
These Assessments should not be used for regrouping students during
the Knowledge Strand. In fact, all students should participate in gradelevel Knowledge instruction, regardless of their decoding skills. Limited
decoding skills will not prevent a student from learning from the ReadAlouds, discussions, and activities that are part of the Knowledge Strand. It
is critical that all students continue to build their oral vocabulary and content
knowledge, irrespective of their decoding skills. In fact, the focus on oral
language in the Knowledge Strand may provide struggling decoders with an
opportunity to shine.


**INTERPRETING ASSESSMENT SCORES USING**
~~**THE PLACEMENT AND GROUPING CHART**~~


**Note:** The scores on the Placement and Grouping chart that follows should
not be confused with the scores on the Order of Assessments chart provided
for administration of assessments in the Assessment Overview section and
Lessons 5–8. Each of the scores in this chart represents a degree of
mastery (or lack thereof) on each sub-test. Group placements are derived
by considering each student’s degree of mastery on the combined
assessments administered.

Lessons 6–8 Placement Assessment: Individual Assessments
**99**


**Note:** Scores on the Code Knowledge Diagnostic Assessment need
to be interpreted with care. If a student makes errors in indicating the
correct short vowel sounds for three or more of the letters representing
the short vowel sounds (i.e., ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, or ‘u’) he or she may require
intensive remediation, regardless of the overall Code Knowledge Diagnostic
Assessment score. Even if the description for such a student indicates
adequate preparation for Grade 1 Unit 2 based on the overall score, it may
be wiser to view this student’s preparation as questionable and first start
with a comprehensive review of Kindergarten Units 6–8, if available. Strong
mastery of the short vowel letter-sound correspondences is a prerequisite
before starting Grade 1 Unit 2.


~~**PLACEMENT AND GROUPING GUIDELINES**~~


Grade 1 teachers should meet as a team after they have completed the
Placement Planning Sheet and have assigned a group number to each
student in their class. Using the group numbers, begin sorting students
from all classrooms on the basis of their group number, using the following
approximate guidelines:





|If there is only one<br>classroom teacher<br>per grade level…|…the teacher should start all students with Grade 1 Unit 2,<br>providing individualized remediation in small groups using<br>Additional Support and Pausing Point activities.|
|---|---|
|**If there are two**<br>**classroom teachers**<br>**per grade level…**|One teacher provides Skills instruction with Grade 1 Unit<br>2. The other teacher provides Skills instruction from<br>Kindergarten Units 6–8.|
|**If there are three**<br>**classroom teachers**<br>**per grade level…**|One teacher provides Skills instruction with Grade 1 Unit 2.<br>Another teacher also provides Grade 1 Unit 2 Skills instruction.<br>A third teacher provides Skills instruction from Kindergarten<br>Units 6–8.|
|**If there are four**<br>**classroom teachers**<br>**per grade level…**|One teacher provides Skills instruction with Grade 1 Unit 2.<br>Another teacher also provides Grade 1 Unit 2 Skills instruction.<br>A third teacher provides Skills instruction from Kindergarten<br>Units 6–8. A fourth teacher provides Skills instruction from<br>Additional Support activities from Kindergarten Units 6–8.|


Foundational Skills 1



**100**


These grouping guidelines are only a starting point; other variables, such
as the number of students across the grade level in any given group, will
also need to be considered. If there are disproportionately larger numbers
of one or more particular groups of students, these guidelines will need to
be modified to ensure that no one teacher has a disproportionately larger
class size. It is especially important that Group 3 students be in small- to
moderate-size classes whenever possible.


**Analyzing Assessments for Additional Instructional Information**


Once students have been grouped and placed, you are encouraged to
conduct a more refined error analysis of student performance on the various
assessments as follows in order to better tailor small group instruction to
meet individual students’ needs:


  - **Word Recognition Assessment** —See error analysis for each student as
documented on the Scoring Sheet for the Word Recognition Assessment,
Activity Page 4.1. Provide specific remediation for the letter-sound
correspondences and/or Tricky Words missed; see Unit 1 Pausing Point
activities.


  - **Pseudoword Reading Assessment** —See error analysis for each student as
documented on the Pseudoword Reading Assessment Scoring Sheet, Activity
Page 5.3. Provide specific remediation for the letter-sound correspondences
missed; see Unit 1 Pausing Point.


  - **Code Knowledge Diagnostic Assessment** —See errors marked on the
Code Knowledge Diagnostic Assessment, Activity Page 5.4. Provide specific
remediation for the letter-sound correspondences missed; see Unit 1 Pausing
Point activities _._


  - **Letter Name Assessment** —See errors marked on Activity Page 5.5. Provide
specific practice in letter naming; see Unit 1 Pausing Point activities.


**Note:** While students who do not know some of the letter names certainly
should practice and learn the letter names, lack of knowledge of the letter
names will not substantially interfere with their ability to read text in the
early Grade 1 units.

Foundational Skills 1


**Reading**

  - Today you will begin the new Reader, _Snap Shots_ . Using the digital version of
_Snap Shots_ found in the program’s online materials or the _Snap Shots_ Big
Book, you will read the first story, “Beth,” to your class. If using the digital
version, you may want to practice reading this story to familiarize yourself with
the online format of the Reader before presenting the story to your class.


  - In the story, the main character, Beth, travels to the United Kingdom. You will
want to have a world map or globe available to show students the locations
of the United Kingdom and the United States.


  - At the start of each week, prepare the Discussion Questions Observation
Record provided in Teacher Resources and add it to your clipboard with the
Oral Blending and Segmenting Observation Record. Over the course of the
week, be sure to ask each student to respond to at least one discussion
question. Make notes regarding each student’s ability to respond in complete
sentences and answer questions about characters, setting, and main event.


  - Study the sample Discussion Questions Observation Record to familiarize
yourself with the manner in which you will document student performance.


  - You may wish to start a word wall specific to the _Snap Shots_ Reader. Add
words to it throughout the lessons. Be sure to write these words on white or
green index cards to indicate that they are decodable.


  - After reading the demonstration story “Beth” to the class you will give
students time to read the story on their own with a partner. Please think
in advance about how you will pair students; refer to the section in the
introduction on _Snap Shots_ for more guidance on partner reading.


  - Study the sample Anecdotal Reading Record to familiarize yourself with the
manner in which you will take notes as you listen to students read aloud.
Make one copy of the blank Anecdotal Reading Record for every student in
your class, and label each with a student’s name. Place all of these records
in alphabetical order on a new clipboard with a pen so they are ready for use
when students read aloud.

 - Point out the power bar below the spelling ‘th’ and remind students that this
bar indicates how common each spelling is.


 - Point to the power bar under the ‘th’ and ask students whether they think ‘th’
is a very common spelling or a less common spelling for /th/. _(very common)_


**Oral Blending**

 - Say _thin_ in a segmented fashion, marking each sound with a thumb-finger
tap. Start with a thumb-forefinger tap.


 - The finger taps represent sounds. Tapping helps students hear and
distinguish individual sounds.


 - Blend the sounds to produce the word _thin_, making a fist with your hand.


 - Have students tap and blend the sounds in the word.


 - Repeat steps for the word _thud_ .


**Oral Segmenting**

 - Hold up three fingers and say the word _thud_ .


 - Have students repeat the word after you.


 - Wiggle or move your index finger for the first sound in the word, /th/, wiggle
or move your middle finger for the second sound in the word, /u/, and wiggle
or move your ring finger for the third sound in the word, /d/.


 - Have students repeat after you.


 - Repeat steps for the word _thin_ .


 - Turn to **Consonant Code Flip Book page 13** and point to the “sound bubble”
for /th/ on the page, and then point to the outline for the Spelling Card,
placing the ‘th’ Spelling Card for /th/ on the appropriate place on the Code
Flip Book page.


 - Repeat these steps with the consonant Spelling Card for /th/. Use the word

**108**



~~**REVIEW SISTER SOUNDS (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students they are going to learn about the spelling ‘th’ and write this on
the board/chart paper.


 - Explain that when we see the spelling ‘th’, there are two different ways we can
pronounce it: /th/ and /th/. They sound very similar, so we call them sister
sounds.


 - Both of these consonant sounds are made by placing the tongue between
the upper and lower teeth and blowing air out. There is a difference, however.


**Note:** Tell students that when they make the /th/ and /th/ sounds, they can
actually stick their tongues out.


 - Tell students to place their fingers over their ears and their palms on their
cheeks, or their fingertips on their throats.


 - Say the words _teeth_ and _teethe_ . Tell students that teeth are what we have in
our mouths, and teethe is when we grow new teeth.


 - Say the word _teeth_ and have students say the word, first placing their
fingertips on their throats and then placing their fingers over their ears and
their palms on their cheeks.


 - Say the word _teethe_ and have students say the word several times, first
placing their fingertips on their throats and then placing their fingers over
their ears and their palms on their cheeks.


 - Alternate between pointing to _teeth_ and _teethe_, asking students to say the
words. Ask students if they can hear how _teethe_ is buzzier at the end.


 - Have students say the two sounds in isolation, alternating between saying
the /th/ sound and the /th/ sound, stretching each one out.


 - Ask students if they can feel the difference between these two sounds.


 - Explain that the /th/ sound is buzzier than the /th/ sound: it makes our
mouths vibrate.


**Note:** Do not worry if students do not distinguish between the two sounds.
There are very few words where the difference between /th/ and /th/
is meaningful in the way it is in _teeth_ and _teethe_ (and _ether_ and _either_ ).
Students can learn to read and write ‘th’ without being able to distinguish
between these two sounds.


Foundational Skills 1


- Tell students that you are going to say two words: one word will begin
with the buzzy /th/ sound and one word will begin with the /th/ sound.
Students should listen carefully, put their fingers on their throats, and
repeat both words.


- Say the first pair of words and ask students which word begins with the
buzzy /th/ sound.


- Repeat this process with the remaining word pairs.



1. thin—then _(then)_


2. that—thanks _(that)_


3. theft—them _(them)_


~~**REVIEW DIGRAPHS (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Distribute Activity Page 9.1.



4. thud—thus _(thus)_


5. these—theme _(these)_




- Tell students that you are going to show them how to write the sound /th/ as
in _them_ and the sound /th/ as in _thin_ .


- Remind students that the letter ‘t’ by itself stands for the /t/ sound, and the
letter ‘h’ by itself stands for the /h/ sound, but the letters ‘t’ and ‘h’ written
together stand for a completely different sound: either the /th/ sound or the
/th/ sound.


- Write a ‘th’ on handwriting guidelines and describe what you are doing using
the phrases in the diagram.


- Point out that the sounds /th/ and /th/ are written with the same spelling.


- Model writing the digraph two or three more times.


- Have students trace the digraph on the desk with a pointed finger.


- Have students trace and copy ‘th’ on the activity page.


- Encourage students to say the sound /th/ or /th/ each time that they write
the digraph.


- Have students look at the back of the activity page. Read the words and
name the pictures together as a class.


- Tell students to read the words in the box at the top of the activity page and
write each word under its matching picture.

**Tricky Word: The**

 - Show students the Tricky Word card for _the_ and ask them how they would
pronounce it by blending. (They should say /th/ /e/ or /th/ /e/.)


 - Explain that this word is generally pronounced /th/ /u/ as in, “This is the last
slice of pizza.”


 - Write _the_ on the board/chart paper. Point to the spelling ‘th’ and explain that
it is pronounced /th/, as they would probably expect.


 - Underline the letter ‘e’ and explain that it is the tricky part of the word. They
would probably expect this letter to be pronounced /e/, but it is generally
pronounced /u/.


 - Tell students that when reading _the_, they have to remember to pronounce the
letter ‘e’ as /u/.


 - Tell students that when writing _the_, they have to remember to spell the /u/
sound with the letter ‘e’.


 - Point to the word _the_ as you say the following question, “I kicked the ball very
hard.” Ask students to **Turn and Talk** using the word _the_ in an oral sentence.


**Tricky Word: Who**

 - Show students the Tricky Word card for _who_ and ask how they would
pronounce it by blending. (They might say /w/ /h/ /o/ or /w/ /h/ /oo/.)


 - Tell students that this word is actually pronounced /h/ /oo/ as in, “Who has
my doll?”


 - Write _who_ on the board/chart paper. Underline the letters ‘w’ and ‘h’ and
explain that this is a tricky part of the word. They would probably expect
this to be pronounced /w/ /h/ or /w/ (as in _when_, _where_, _why_, _what_, and
_which,_ reviewed later in Unit 1), but it is pronounced /h/.


 - Underline the letter ‘o’ and explain that it is another tricky part of the word.
They would probably expect this letter to be pronounced /o/, but it is
pronounced /oo/, just as it is in _to_ and _do_ .


Foundational Skills 1


  - Tell students that when reading _who_, they have to remember to pronounce
the letters ‘w’ ‘h’ as /h/ and the letter ‘o’ as /oo/.


  - Tell students that when writing _who_, they have to remember to spell the /h/
sound with the letters ‘w’ ‘h’ and the /oo/ sound with the letter ‘o’.

    - Table of contents

    - Page ___ (number)

    - Punctuation marks (period, question mark, exclamation point, dialogue)

    - Glossary


  - Have students discuss the purpose of each feature with a partner.


  - Tell students that today they will begin reading the book _Snap Shots_ .


  - Ask students, “Based on the title, what do you think we will see throughout
the stories?” _(snap shots)_


  - Explain that _Snap Shots_ is about a girl named Beth who is 10 years old. Like
us, Beth lives in the United States, or the U.S. for short.


  - Tell students they will be gathering information about Beth.


  - Tell students that Beth gets to take a trip to the United Kingdom, or the
U.K. for short. The United Kingdom, or the U.K., is made up of the group of
countries of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.


  - Tell students that in this Reader, Beth tells about her trip and shares some
snap shots she has taken.


**Purpose for Reading** ~~**TEKS 1.6.A**~~

  - Remind students that people read for different reasons, and ask students for
some examples. Tell students that the title of today’s story is “Beth.” Explain
to students that our purpose for reading “Beth” is to practice reading the
letter sounds and tricky words we’ve been learning, and to understand Beth’s
story. Tell students that they should listen to the story to gather information
about Beth and watch how you read the words.


~~**TEACHER DEMONSTRATION: READ “BETH” (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind the class that stories are made up of sentences. A sentence is a
complete thought. Sentences start with a capital letter and end with a period.
The period indicates that it is time to make a full stop and take a breath when
reading.


  - Read the story once through without stopping. Track the words with your
finger or a pointer as you read.


**TEKS 1.6.A** Establish purpose for reading assigned and self-selected texts with adult assistance.


Foundational Skills 1


 - Tell students that you will read the story again, asking them questions along
the way. Use the Guided Reading Supports below after reading each page.


**Page 4**


 - Ask, “Who can tell me a noun that names a person on this page? Who can tell
me a noun that names a thing?” You may have students come to the front of
the class to point to the words.


 - Point to the word _the_ . Ask students, “Why do you think the word the is
underlined? What have we learned about this word?” (It is a Tricky Word.)
The letter ‘e’ is underlined because that is the part of the word that is not
sounded /e/ as we might expect.” Tell students that in the Reader, the tricky
parts of Tricky Words are underlined.


**Page 7**


 - Point to Beth and her mom. Say, “If mom and Beth are smiling and making
silly faces, how do they feel about going to the camp?” _(They feel happy.)_


**Page 9**


 - Ask, “What is the dog eating? Where in the text do we see the answer?” _(He is_
_eating a hot dog.)_


**Wrap-Up**

 - Discuss the following questions as a class referring to specific text in the
story to help students answer. Encourage students to respond in a complete
sentence incorporating the question stem in their answer.


**Discussion Questions for “Beth”**


1. **Literal.** Where are Beth and her parents?


» They are at camp.


2. **Inferential.** Who is telling us the story? In other words, who is the narrator?


» Beth is telling the story.


3. **Literal.** Beth took a funny snap shot. What did she take a picture of?

**Code Knowledge**



Before today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
277 and 335 of those words would be completely decodable.


After today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
302 and 374 of those words would be completely decodable.


Students have now reviewed one way to write 29 of the 44 sounds in English.


The sound /th/ is the 40 [th] most common sound in English.


The sound /th/ is spelled ‘th’ approximately 100 percent of the time.


The sound /th/ is the 8 [th] most common sound in English. It is found in several of the
most common words in the language (e.g., _the_, _then_, _they_, _them_, _there_, _this_, _that_ ).

Lesson 10 Review: Basic Code and Tricky Words
**121**


For segmenting


Support


The finger taps represent
sounds. Tapping helps
students hear and
distinguish individual
sounds. When students
are ready, gradually
reduce the support for
blending and segmenting.


By the end of this unit (if
not earlier), you should
provide only the visual
support for blending and
segmenting, and not
blend and segment the
words for students.


**122**



**Oral Segmenting**

 - Hold up three fingers and say the word _ring_ .


 - Have students repeat the word after you.


 - Wiggle or move your index finger for the first sound in the word, /r/, wiggle or
move your middle finger for the second sound in the word, /i/, and wiggle or
move your ring finger for the third sound in the word, /ng/.


 - Have students repeat after you.


 - Repeat steps for the word _king_ .


 - Turn to **Consonant Code Flip Book page 17** and point to the sound bubble
for /ng/ on the page, and then point to the outline for the Spelling Card,
placing the ‘ng’ Spelling Card for /ng/ on the appropriate place on the Code
Flip Book page.


 - Ask students to turn to their **Individual Code Chart page 8** and outline the
card and code information for ‘ng’ in red.


 - Repeat the above steps with the consonant Spelling Card for /qu/. Use the
word _quiz_ for additional Oral Segmenting and Oral Blending practice.


**Note:** The spelling ‘qu’ is not included on the Individual Code Chart.


**Consonant Code Flip Book**


1. /qu/ > ‘qu’ ( _quit_ ) **page 25**


 - Quickly review by showing the cards and having students say the sound
represented on each card.


**Note:** /qu/ is a sound combination consisting of two sounds, /k/ and /w/.
It is reviewed here as if it were one sound because the two letters in the
digraph ‘qu’ occur as a unit. There is no need to explain this to the class. If
a student notices that /qu/ consists of two sounds, you should confirm this
and compliment the student for being a good listener.


~~**REVIEW GRAPHEMES (15 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** Students will need the letters that they cut out today again in the next
lesson. Please collect the cards or have students store them carefully. Say,
“I see the letters ‘th’ at the end of this word. Notice how you cannot hear
both the /t/ and /h/ sounds. Instead, the letters work together to make one
sound: /th/.”


Foundational Skills 1


- Remind the class that there are two kinds of sounds in the English language:
vowel sounds and consonant sounds. Remind the class that vowel sounds
are made with an open mouth.


- Tell the class that during this lesson they will review vowel sounds and
consonant sounds.


- Have students repeat the following vowel sounds after you: /i/, /e/, /a/, /u/, /o/.


- Remind the class that consonants are made with a closed mouth.
Consonants are any letter that is not a vowel.


- Distribute Activity Page 10.1 and scissors.


- Explain that the activity page contains the lowercase letters (spellings) of the
following sounds: /i/, /e/, /a/, /u/, and /o/.


- Have students cut out the letters.


- Tell students that you want them to show you the spelling ‘i’ when you say the
/i/ sound, ‘e’ when you say the /e/ sound, ‘a’ when you say the /a/ sound, ‘u’
when you say the /u/ sound, and ‘o’ when you say the /o/ sound.


- Practice this several times.


- Ask students to place their cards at their feet or at the corner of their desk or
table.


- Tell students they are going to practice adding consonants to the vowel
sounds they just practiced.


- Write an ‘n’ on the board/chart paper.


- Ask students what sound the letter ‘n’ stands for. ( _They should say /n/._ )


- Write a ‘g’ on the board/chart paper.


- Ask students what sound the letter ‘g’ stands for. ( _They should say /g/._ )


- Write the spelling ‘ng’ on the board/chart paper.


- Ask students what sound the spelling ‘ng’ stands for. ( _They might say /n/ /g/._ )


- Explain that the sounds /n/ and /ng/ are very similar.


- Review with students how to apply spelling knowledge of the letter sound
correspondences you are studying, such as digraphs.


- Ask students to pick their letter cards back up and listen carefully for the
vowel sound they hear.


- Say the word _king_ . Say each sound slowly for the class: /k/, /i/, /ng/.



Activity Page 10.1


Support


If students have difficulty
pronouncing the vowel
sounds accurately, have
them say the words _knit_,
_net_, _gnat_, _nut,_ and _knot_ in
this order and in reverse
order before having them
say the vowel sounds in
isolation. Show a picture of
a person’s hands knitting
and say _knit_, asking
students to repeat. Repeat
the process with the
other pictures, then have
students say the words in
order. You may adopt other
gestures for the sounds
if you find them more
effective. You may omit the
gestures once students
are making the sounds
accurately and confidently.



Lesson 10 Review: Basic Code and Tricky Words
**123**


Support


If students have trouble
hearing a word’s middle
sound, say the word in a
segmented fashion: “/p/ /i/
/t/.” Then repeat the word
in its blended form: “ _pit_ .”


**124**




 - Show students the ‘i’ letter card. Say, “I hear the vowel sound /i/ in _king_ .
Letter ‘i’ stands for the /i/ sound.”


 - Ask students to listen for the next vowel sound. They should show you the
spelling when you say the sound.


 - Say the word _kong_ . Students should show you the spelling ‘o’ when you say
the word kong.


 - Repeat the steps for the following words: _rung_, _fang_, _cling_, _ding_, _song_, and _bang_ .


 - Introduce the digraph ‘qu’ by repeating the steps above. Explain that this
stands for the sounds /k/ + /w/.


 - Have students repeat these words after you: _quit_, _quack_, and _queen_ .


Check for Understanding


Monitor students’ performance as they move from one word to
the next, by scanning the room for the correct spelling associated
with the vowel sound, and noting which students are struggling
with vowel discrimination.


~~**TRICKY WORDS: SAID, SAYS (5 MIN.)**~~


**Tricky Word: Said**

 - Show students the Tricky Word card _said_ and ask them how they would read
the word by blending. (They might say a two-syllable word: /s/ /a/ - /i/ /d/).


 - Explain that we actually pronounce this word /s/ /e/ /d/ as in, “Did you hear
what I said?”


 - Write _said_ on the board/chart paper. Point to the letters ‘s’ and ‘d’ and explain
that these are pronounced just as they would expect, as /s/ and /d/.


 - Underline the letters ‘a’ and ‘i’ and explain that these letters are the tricky part of
the word. They might expect that these letters would be pronounced separately
as /a/ and /i/, but in fact they work together to stand for the /e/ sound.


 - Tell students that when reading _said_, they have to remember to pronounce
the letters ‘a’ and ‘i’ as /e/.


 - Tell students that when writing _said_, they have to remember to spell the /e/
sound with the letters ‘a’ and ‘i’.


Foundational Skills 1


 - Point to the word _said_ as you say the following sentence, “The teacher said to
put down our pencils.” Ask students to **Turn and Talk**, using the word _said_ in
oral sentences.


**Tricky Word: Says**

 - Show students the Tricky Word card _says_ and ask them how they would read
the word by blending. (They might try to say something like /s/ /a/ /y/ /s/.)


 - Explain that we actually pronounce this word /s/ /e/ /z/ as in, “He says,
‘Happy Birthday!’”


 - Write _says_ on the board/chart paper. Point to the first letter ‘s’ and explain
that it is pronounced just as one would expect, as /s/.


 - Underline the letters ‘a’ and ‘y’ and explain that these are the tricky part of the
word. They might expect that these letters would be pronounced separately as
/a/ and /y/, but in fact they work together to stand for the /e/ sound.


 - Circle the final letter ‘s’ and remind students that sometimes the letter ‘s’ is
pronounced /z/. The last ‘s’ in _says_ is pronounced /z/ as in _his_, _has_, and _is_ .


 - Tell students that when reading _says_, they have to remember to pronounce
the letters ‘a’ and ‘y’ as /e/ and the final ‘s’ as /z/.


 - Tell students that when writing _says_, they have to remember to spell the /e/
sound with the letters ‘a’ and ‘y’, and the /z/ sound with ‘s’.


 - Point to the word _says_ as you say the following sentence, “Everybody says
the food is good.” Ask students to **Turn and Talk**, using the word _says_ in oral
sentences.



Support


Provide students with
contexts in which
someone might say these
sentences in the Tricky
Words activity. Be sure

  - Tell students that they have now read about two different characters. Ask
students to describe who these characters are. (Beth and Kat, friends
from camp)


**Page 10**

  - Point to and read the Tricky Words. (Tricky Words are the underlined words in
the story.) Ask a student volunteer to read the sentences.


  - Ask, “Why does the word _Kat_ begin with an uppercase letter?” ( _People’s_
_names start with an uppercase letter._ )


**Page 14**

  - Point to the apostrophe in the word _Kat’s_ . Tell students that what looks like
a comma in the air is called an apostrophe. Ask students to repeat the word
_apostrophe_ after you. Tell students the apostrophe here tells us that the mom
is Kat’s mom.

 - Draw attention to the comma in the sentence: _Kat left_, _and I felt sad_ . Tell
students commas are used in the middle of sentences, and we should pause
to take a breath if we see one when reading.


**Page 16**

 - Point to the exclamation point in the second sentence. Explain that many
sentences end in a period, but sometimes they end in something else. Ask,
“Does anyone recognize what this is? It is called an exclamation point, and it
means that we should read the sentence with excitement.”


 - Demonstrate the difference between reading a sentence ending in a period,
and reading one that ends in an exclamation point.


 - Ask, “What does Beth mean when she says, ‘I got to sit next to the wing.’?”
( _Beth could look out the window near her seat and see the wing of the jet._ )

 - Point out the apostrophe in _Kat’s_ . Ask students if they remember what an
apostrophe tells us.


**Wrap-Up**

 - Discuss the following questions as a class, referring to specific text in the
story to help students answer. Encourage students to respond in a complete
sentence, incorporating the question stem in their answer.

    - 9 or 10 points—excellent


    - 8 points—good


    - 6 or 7 points—fair


    - Less than 6 points—poor


**Goal:** Achieve scores of good or excellent (8 points or higher).


Scores of 7 or less indicate additional reteaching and reinforcement is
required.


**Code Knowledge**


Before today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between

If students are having
difficulty pronouncing the
vowel sounds accurately,
you may have them
say the words _knit_, _net_,
_gnat_, _nut,_ and _knot_ in
this order and in reverse
order before having them
say the vowel sounds in
isolation. Show a picture
of a person’s hands
knitting and say _knit_,
asking students to repeat.
Repeat the process with
the other pictures, then
have students say the
words in order. You may
adopt other gestures for
the sounds if you find
them more effective. You
may omit the gestures
once students are making
the sounds accurately and
confidently.

~~**VOWEL AND CONSONANT REVIEW (25 MIN.)**~~


**Mirror, Mirror**


**Note:** If you have handheld mirrors, you may use them for this exercise. If you
do not, you may have students work with a partner. Tell them to watch their
partner’s mouth when they make the vowel sounds to observe what happens.


 - Ask students to share something that they remember about vowel sounds.


 - Summarize the important information:


   - Vowel sounds are open-mouth sounds.


   - Vowel sounds can be stretched out when someone calls out a name
or sings.


   - Every word must have a vowel sound.


 - Tell the class that during this lesson they will review consonant sounds.


 - Remind the class that most words contain consonant sounds but a few
words do not. For example, the word _I_ does not contain a consonant sound.


 - Remind the class that consonant sounds are made with parts of the mouth
touching or momentarily closed. This slows or stops the flow of air leaving
the mouth.


 - Have students watch their mouths (or their partner’s mouth) as they say the
consonant sound /m/.


 - Point out that when they say this consonant sound, their mouths stay
completely closed. Air does not flow freely from their mouths—it is released
through their noses.


 - Have students watch their mouths (or their partner’s mouth) as they say the
consonant sound /p/.


 - Point out that when they say this consonant sound, their mouths close
momentarily and then open to release a puff of air. Air does not flow
continuously from their mouths—it is stopped for a moment when their lips
are closed and then it is released.


 - Have students watch their mouths as they say the consonant sound /th/.


 - Point out that when they say this consonant sound, their tongues are
between their upper and lower teeth. Air does not flow freely from their
mouths—it is slowed down as it moves around their tongues.


 - Point out that none of these consonant sounds are made with a wide open
mouth, which is the way that vowel sounds are made.


Foundational Skills 1


 - Have the class listen as you sing “Happy Birthday” with only the consonant
sounds: “/h/. . . /p/. . . /b/. . . /th/. . . /d/,” etc.


 - Point out that this song sounds like a bunch of clipped, almost inaudible
sounds without the vowel sounds.


**Vowel Discrimination Game**

 - Distribute the vowel cards students cut out from the previous lesson.


 - Tell students that you want them to show you the picture of /i/ when you
say the /i/ sound, /e/ when you say the /e/ sound, /a/ when you say the /a/
sound, /u/ when you say the /u/ sound, and /o/ when you say the /o/ sound.


 - Practice this several times.


 - Next, tell students that you will be reading some three-sound words that
contain only one vowel sound. The vowel sound will always be the middle
sound, and it will always be /i/, /e/, /a/, /u/, or /o/.


 - Tell students you want them to show you the picture of /i/ when you say a
word that contains the /i/ sound, /e/ when you say a word that contains the
/e/ sound, etc.


1. hop 4. gum 7. top


2. shed 5. cat 8. chip


3. pin 6. bet


Check for Understanding


Monitor students’ performance as they move from one word to
the next by scanning the room for the correct sound and noting
which students are struggling with vowel discrimination.


~~**REVIEW DOUBLE-LETTER SPELLINGS (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that many consonant sounds can be written with either a single
letter or with two of the same letter.


 - Write the letter ‘b’ on the board/chart paper.


 - Ask students what sound the letter ‘b’ stands for. _(They should say /b/.)_



Support


If students have trouble
hearing a word’s middle
sound, say the word in
a segmented fashion:
/h/ /o/ /p/. Then repeat
the word in its blended
form: _hop_ .

**142**




 - Write the spelling ‘bb’ on the board/chart paper.


 - Tell students that this spelling is another way to write the /b/ sound.


 - Write the words _bed_ and _ebb_ on the board/chart paper.


 - Point out that in the word _bed_, the /b/ sound is written with the spelling ‘b’. In
the word _ebb_, the /b/ sound is written with the double-letter spelling ‘bb’.


 - Using the procedures established in earlier lessons, place the spelling for
/b/ > ‘bb’ ( _rubbing_ ) on **Consonant Code Flip Book page 2** .


 - Continue to demonstrate this principle using the spellings and words that follow.


 - Once you have discussed all of the spellings listed here, tell the class that
these double-letter spellings are never found at the beginning of words. They
are found at the end of words or in the middle of longer words.


**Note:** The two-syllable example word _comment_ is included in this exercise
because ‘mm’ is not found in common one-syllable words. Help students
read the word if necessary. Two-syllable words are not explicitly taught or

~~**REVIEW /K/ › ‘CK’ (10 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** In this exercise you will sort words that contain the /k/ sound spelled
‘c’, ‘k’, or ‘ck’ on the board/chart paper. It will be useful to discuss with
students how the two slashes with a letter in between refer to a sound. A
useful phrase to differentiate letters and sounds that you can teach students
is, “Letters you see, sounds you hear.”


) **Digital Component 11.1**


 - Referring to the blank chart on the board/chart paper, point to the /k/ at the


Foundational Skills 1


top of the chart. Explain that the letter ‘k’ in slashes stands for the sound /k/.


  - Point to the letter ‘c’ on the board/chart paper below /k/ and ask students
what sound the letter ‘c’ stands for. _(They should say /k/.)_


  - Write the word _cat_ under the header ‘c’.


  - Ask students to think of another word that contains the /k/ sound spelled
with ‘c’ and write it under the ‘c’ header.


  - Point to the letter ‘k’ on the board/chart paper and ask students what sound
the letter ‘k’ stands for. _(They should say /k/.)_


  - Write the word _kid_ under the ‘k’ header.


  - Ask students to think of another word that contains the /k/ sound spelled
with ‘k’ and write it under the ‘k’ header.


  - Point to the spelling ‘ck’ on the board/chart paper.


  - Explain that this spelling also stands for the /k/ sound.


  - Write the word _duck_ under the ‘ck’ header and have students read the word.


  - Tell students that the spelling ‘ck’ is like the double-letter spellings that they
have learned: It never comes at the beginning of a word—only at the end, or
in the middle of longer words.


  - Turn to **Consonant Code Flip Book page 5** and put the Spelling Card on the
appropriate space. Discuss the power bar.


  - Direct students to turn to **Individual Code Chart page 6** and outline the
card outline and code knowledge for ‘ck’ > /k/ using their red markers.


  - Write additional words (see chart) on the board/chart paper and ask
students where to add them in the table.


  - Summarize by saying that the sound /k/ can be spelled three different ways,
with ‘c’ as in _cat_, ‘k’ as in _kid_, and ‘ck’ as in _duck_ . The spelling ‘ck’ never occurs
at the beginning of a word.

**Preview Core Vocabulary**


Before reading today’s story, preview the following vocabulary with students.
Write each word on the board/chart paper for students to read, explain the
meaning, and provide an example of the word used in a sentence.


**vet—n.,** a doctor for animals (short for _veterinarian_ ) (24)

Example: We took our dog to the vet when he was sick.


**cast—n.,** a thick wrapping that surrounds a body part that has a broken bone (26)

Example: The doctor put a cast on my wrist when I broke it.


**Note:** You may wish to tell students that the word _cast_ can also be used as
a noun to mean the people who are acting in a play or movie. You may also
wish to tell students that vet is a multiple-meaning word. It can refer to a
veteran or a veterinarian.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today you will discuss the sister sounds /s/ and /z/. The sounds /s/ and
/z/ are both made by positioning the tongue close to the ridge behind the
upper teeth. The only difference is that /s/ is unvoiced and /z/ is voiced.
The spelling ‘s’ is pronounced /s/ after unvoiced consonant sounds and /z/
after voiced consonant sounds. This is because once the voice box begins
to vibrate, it “wants” to continue vibrating. When saying the word _dogs_, the
voice box begins to vibrate with the voiced consonant sound /g/. The voice
box then continues vibrating, which means that the last sound in the word
_is_ /z/, not /s/. Conversely, when saying _cats_, the voice box does not vibrate
with the unvoiced consonant sound /t/. Because the voice box does not
vibrate, the last sound in the word _is_ /s/.


 - Gather the Spelling Cards for /k/ > ‘cc’ ( _hiccup_ ), /t/ > ‘tt’ ( _sitting_ ), /r/ > ‘rr’
( _ferret_ ), /n/ > ‘nn’ ( _running_ ), /p/ > ‘pp’ ( _napping_ ) for Review Double-Letter
Spellings.


 - Write the Tricky Words _was_, _when_, and _why_ on yellow index cards.


 - Gather sufficient index cards so you can provide one per student.

~~**REVIEW DOUBLE-LETTER SPELLINGS (15 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** A few two-syllable example words are included in this exercise because
several of these double-letter spellings are not found in common one-syllable
words. Help students read these words if necessary. Two-syllable words are
not explicitly taught or included in the Grade 1 Readers until Unit 4.


 - Tell students that today they will review some more double-letter spellings.


 - Remind students that many consonant sounds can be written with either a
single letter or with two of the same letter.


 - Write the letter ‘c’ on the board/chart paper.


 - Ask students what sound the letter ‘c’ stands for. _(They should say /k/.)_


 - Write the spelling ‘cc’ on the board/chart paper.


 - Tell students that this spelling is another way to write the /k/ sound.


 - Write the words _cat_ and _hiccup_ on the board/chart paper.


 - Point out that in the word _cat_, the /k/ sound is written with the spelling ‘c’. In
the word _hiccup_, the /k/ sound is written with the double-letter spelling ‘cc’.


 - Using the procedures established in earlier lessons, place the Spelling Card
for /k/ > ‘cc’ ( _hiccup_ ) in the **Consonant Code Flip Book page 5** and outline
the card and code knowledge on **Individual Code Chart page 6** .


 - Continue to demonstrate this principle using the spellings and words listed.

 - Write the spelling ‘bb’ on the board/chart paper.


 - Tell students that this spelling is another way to write the /b/ sound.


 - Write the words _bed_ and _ebb_ on the board/chart paper.


 - Point out that in the word _bed_, the /b/ sound is written with the spelling ‘b’. In
the word _ebb_, the /b/ sound is written with the double-letter spelling ‘bb’.


 - Using the procedures established in earlier lessons, place the spelling for
/b/ > ‘bb’ ( _rubbing_ ) on **Consonant Code Flip Book page 2** .


 - Continue to demonstrate this principle using the spellings and words that
follow.


 - Once you have discussed all of the spellings listed here, tell the class that
these double-letter spellings are never found at the beginning of words. They
are found at the end of words or in the middle of longer words.


**Note:** The two-syllable example word _comment_ is included in this exercise
because ‘mm’ is not found in common one-syllable words. Help students
read the word if necessary. Two-syllable words are not explicitly taught or

~~**SISTER SOUNDS /S/ AND /Z/ AND /Z/ > ‘S’ (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain that /s/ and /z/ sound very similar. Ask, “What do we call sounds that
sound very much alike?” _(sister sounds)_ Both of these consonant sounds are
made by positioning the tongue close to the ridge behind the upper teeth and
pushing air out of the mouth. There is a difference, however.


 - Tell students to place their fingers over their ears and their palms on their
cheeks, or place their fingertips on their throats.


 - Have students alternate between saying the /s/ sound and the /z/ sound,
stretching each one out.


 - Explain that the /z/ sound is buzzier than the /s/ sound; it makes our
mouths vibrate.


 - Tell students that you are going to say two words: one word will begin with
the /s/ sound and one word will begin with the buzzy /z/ sound. Students
should listen carefully and then place their fingers on their throats (or cover
their ears) and repeat both words.


 - Say the first pair of words.


 - Ask students which word begins with the buzzy /z/ sound.


 - Repeat this process with the remaining word pairs.


**Note:** This is an oral exercise. Students are not expected to read these
words, as some of them are not yet decodable.


1. First sound: sip—zip; sap—zap; sit—zit


2. Last sound: bus—buzz; hiss—his; peace—peas


 - Tell the class that the letter ‘s’ at the beginning of a word is almost always
pronounced /s/. However, in some other places, sometimes at the end of a
word, the letter ‘s’ is often pronounced /z/.


 - Write the word _dogs_ on the board/chart paper and have a student read it
out loud.


 - Ask students what sound they hear at the end of this word. (/z/)


 - Using the procedures established in earlier lessons, place the Spelling Card
for /z/ > ‘s’ ( _dogs_ ) in the **Consonant Code Flip Book page 12** .


 - Circle the ‘s’ in _dogs_ to reinforce the fact that ‘s’ represents the /z/ sound in
this word.

~~**TRICKY WORDS: WAS, WHEN, WHY (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Write the words _was_, _when_, and _why_ on yellow index cards. Tell students they
will learn three new Tricky Words today.


**Tricky Word: Was**

 - Show students the Tricky Word card _was_ and ask how they would pronounce
it by blending. (They might say /w/ /a/ /s/ or /w/ /a/ /z/.)


 - Explain that this word is actually pronounced /w/ /u/ /z/ as in, “I was happy.”


 - Write _was_ on the board/chart paper.


 - Underline the letter ‘a’ and explain that it is the tricky part of the word.
Explain that in the word _was_, the a is pronounced /u/.


 - Point to the letter ‘s’ and explain that in the word _was_, the letter ‘s’ stands for
the /z/ sound.


 - Tell students that when reading _was_, they have to remember to pronounce
the letter ‘a’ as /u/ and the letter ‘s’ as /z/.


 - Tell students that when writing _was_, they have to remember to spell the /u/
sound with the letter ‘a’ and the /z/ sound with the letter ‘s’.

 - Point to the word _which_ as you say the following question, “Which flavor of ice
cream do you like?” Ask students to **Turn and Talk**, using the word _which_ to
start a question.


~~**REVIEW THE QUESTION MARK (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain that today’s Tricky Words are all question words. These words are
used to ask questions. The question words ask for different things, but they
all help to find out more information.


 - Point out that when we ask a question, our voice goes up in pitch. You can
hear it in the voice when someone is asking a question.


 - Ask students to listen to your voice as you are saying the following questions:
“Where did you go?” “Why do you like ice cream?” “What is the color of your
eyes?”


 - In speech you can easily hear that someone is asking a question or is just
making a statement. In writing, the reader needs to see punctuation marks to
understand that.


 - Remind students that in _Snap Shots_ they have already seen periods (full
stops), exclamation points, and question marks at the end of sentences.

1. **Literal.** How did Kat, Beth, and their moms get to their spot for the snap shot?


» They ran up a bunch of steps.


2. **Inferential.** What does it mean to huff and puff? Which parts of the text on page 36
help you to figure out what huff and puff means?


» It means to breathe heavily after exercising. The lines on page 36 that are helpful
are “had to run up a bunch of steps to get to this spot” and the comparison that
the kids “ran up fast” while the “moms had to huff and puff.”


3. **Inferential.** Who took the first snap shot?


» Beth is the narrator; Beth’s mom took the first snap shot.


4. **Inferential.** Why is Kat like a rock in the second snap shot? Look at the illustration
on page 39.


» Accept reasonable answers based on the illustration.


5. **Evaluative.** Which snap shot do you like the best? Why? Have students provide at
least two reasons.

**Primary Focus**


Students will read the following Tricky Words: _here_, _there_ . ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.vi**~~


Students will orally blend and segment single-syllable words with up to four
phonemes. ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.v; TEKS 1.2.A.vii**~~


Students will identify common nouns that name a person, place, or thing in orally
presented phrases and simple sentences. ~~**TEKS 1.11.D.iii**~~


Students will spell one-syllable short-vowel words with double-consonant spellings
and consonant digraphs (up to four phonemes). ~~**[ TEKS 1.2.C.iii ]**~~


~~**TRICKY WORDS: HERE, THERE (10 MIN.)**~~


**Tricky Word: Here**

  - Show students the Tricky Word card _here_ and ask them to read the word by
blending. (They may say something with two syllables: /h/ /e/ - /r/ /e/ or
/h/ /er/ as in _were_ .)


  - Explain that we actually pronounce this word /h/ /ee/ /r/ as in, “I’m so glad
you’re here!”


  - Write _here_ on the board/chart paper. Point to the letter ‘h’ and explain that it
is pronounced just as one would expect, as /h/.


  - Underline the letters ‘e’ ‘r’ ‘e’ and explain that these are tricky. These letters
stand for the sounds /ee/ /r/.


  - Tell students that when reading _here_, they have to remember to pronounce
the letters ‘e’ ‘r’ ‘e’ as /ee/ /r/.


  - Tell students that when writing _here_, they have to remember to spell the
sounds /ee/ and /r/ with the letters ‘e’ ‘r’ ‘e’.


  - Point to the word _here_ as you say the following sentence, “Please put
your plate here.” Ask students to **Turn and Talk**, using the word _here_ in
oral sentences.

**Tricky Word: There**

 - Show students the Tricky Word card _there_ and ask them to read the word by
blending. (They may try to say /th/ /e/ /r/ /e/ or /th/ /e/ /r/ /e/.)


 - Explain that we actually pronounce this word /th/ /e/ /r/ as in, “He kicked
the ball over _there_ .”


 - Write _there_ on the board/chart paper. Point to the letter team ‘th’ and explain
that it is pronounced just as one would expect, as /th/.


 - Underline the letters ‘e’ ‘r’ ‘e’ and explain that these are the tricky part of
the word. They work differently than in _here_ . The letters are not pronounced
/ ee/ /r/ as in _here_, but work together to stand for the sounds /e/ /r/ as
in _where_ .


 - Tell students that when reading _there_, they have to remember to pronounce
the letters ‘e’ ‘r’ ‘e’ as /e/ /r/.


 - Tell students that when writing _there_, they have to remember to spell the
sounds /e/ /r/ with the letters ‘e’ ‘r’ ‘e’.

your pencil there.” Ask students to **Turn and Talk**, using the word _there_ in
oral sentences.


~~**REVIEW QUOTATION MARKS (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students that there are special punctuation marks that we use when
we want to indicate a person’s exact words. They are called quotation marks.


 - Have students say _quotation marks_ .


 - Point to the chart prepared in advance and read the first sentence: _Beth said,_
_“I can run fast.”_


 - Explain that the quotation marks mean that these are a person’s exact
words. There is one set of quotation marks at the beginning of the person’s
words and another set at the end.


 - Point out that quotation marks sort of look like two apostrophes written right
next to each other.


 - Point to the next sentence: _Dad said, “Run and get the bag.”_


 - Ask a student to read the sentence and to point to the quotation marks.


 - Ask a student what Dad said. Point out that Dad’s words are in
quotation marks.


Foundational Skills 1


  - Point to the last sentence: _Mom says, “Scrub that tub!”_


  - Ask a student to read the sentence and to point to the quotation marks.


  - Ask a student what Mom says. Point out that Mom’s words are in
quotation marks.


  - Summarize by saying that quotation marks are used in text to show a
person’s exact words.


) **Digital Component 14.1**


1. Beth said, “I can run fast.” 3. Mom says, “Scrub that tub!”


2. Dad said, “Run and get the bag.”


~~**IDENTIFY NOUNS (5 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.11.D.iii**~~


**Note:** In this lesson you will review that nouns can name either a person,
place, or thing.


**Nouns Naming People**

  - Remind students that they have been learning about nouns that
name people.


  - Tell students to listen carefully to the next phrase and repeat it after you.


  - Say, “Bob runs,” and ask, “Which word in the phrase names a person?”


  - When students have given the correct answer, say, “ _Bob_ is a person and the
word for a part of speech that names a person is _noun_ .”


**Nouns Naming Things**

  - Remind students that they have also been learning about nouns that
name things.


  - Tell students to listen carefully to the next phrase and repeat it after you.


  - Say, “truck unloads,” and ask, “Which word in the phrase names a thing?”


  - When students have given the correct answer, say, “The word _truck_ is a thing
and the word for a part of speech that names a thing is _noun_ .”


**Nouns Naming Places**

  - Remind students that they have also been learning about nouns that
name places.


**TEKS 1.11.D.iii** Edit drafts using standard English conventions including singular, plural, common, and proper nouns.

 - Tell students to listen carefully to the next phrase and repeat it after you.


 - Say, “big library,” and ask, “Which word in the phrase names a place?”


 - When the students have given the correct answer, say, “The word _library_ is a
place and the word for a part of speech that names a place is _noun_ .”


**Practice Nouns**

 - Tell students to listen carefully to the following phrases and ask them to tell
you the word that names a person, place, or thing, and is therefore a noun.


 - Tell students that today’s story takes place at a bus stop. Explain that in a big
city, many people take the bus as a way of getting around town.


1. girl trips 4. wet towel


2. new park 5. boy sings


3. small bird 6. running dogs


Check for Understanding


Summarize by asking students what we call a part of speech that
names a person, place, or thing. _(noun)_


~~**DICTATION WITH WORDS (10 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** Students are not yet expected to reliably know when to use doubleletter spellings. They will learn through the process of self-correction and
more reading practice.


 - Tell students to take out a pencil and a piece of paper.


 - Explain that you are going to say eight words. Each word will contain one of
the double-letter spellings for consonant sounds they have learned.


 - Tell students to write each word that you say.


 - For each word that you say, hold up one finger for each sound.


 - Ask students to count the sounds and then draw a line on their paper for
each sound that they hear. For example, for the word _will_, three lines would be
drawn on the paper:   .


Foundational Skills 1


- Once students have drawn one line for each sound, remind them that the
sound /l/ can be written with the spelling ‘ll’.


- Have students write the spellings on their respective lines: w i ll .


- Finally, ask students to read the word back to you.


- Write the words on the board/chart paper and have students self-correct.



1. will


2. back


3. off


4. tell



5. black


6. less


7. rock


8. grass



**Note:** It might be useful to have students use a different colored pencil for selfcorrection so you can see which spellings students need more practice with.

**Preview Spellings**

 - You may wish to preview the following Tricky Words: _why_, _where_, and _what_ .


 - You may also wish to show students where Scotland is on a world map or
globe and explain that a person from Scotland is called a Scot. You may
write the words _Scotland_ and _Scot_ on the board/chart paper, explaining the
abbreviation to students.


**Purpose for Reading**

 - Tell students to read carefully to learn more about the man in the kilt.


~~**READ “THE MAN IN THE KILT” (10 MIN.)**~~


**Partner Reading**

 - Ask students to sit with their partners and take turns reading “The Man in the
Kilt” aloud.


 - Encourage students who finish early to reread previous stories. They should
not read ahead.


Observation: Anecdotal Reading Record


Circulate through the room so you can listen to pairs of students
read aloud. Make notes on individual students’ Anecdotal Reading
Records.


**Wrap-Up**


**Discussion Questions for “The Man in the Kilt”**


1. **Literal.** Why did Beth think that the man they met was wearing a dress?


» He was wearing a kilt, which looks like a skirt.


2. **Inferential.** What country do kilts come from? What part of the text helped you to
find the answer?


» Kilts come from Scotland. The line in the text that helped is “‘The kilt tells us
that the man is a Scot.’” A person from the country of Scotland is called a Scot,
so kilts must come from the country of Scotland.

‘o’, ‘m’, ‘n’, ‘t’, ‘d’, ‘c’, ‘ck’, ‘g’, ‘v’, ‘s’, ‘p’, ‘b’, ‘l’, ‘ll’, ‘r’, ‘h’, ‘w’, ‘sh’, ‘ch’.


 - Explain that you will say the sounds of a word and that you want the students
with the Large Letter Cards for those sounds to stand next to each other to
spell the word.


 - Say the word _hot_ in a segmented fashion: /h/ /o/ /t/.


 - Ask the class to blend the word.


 - Have students with the Large Letter Cards for ‘h’, ‘o’, and ‘t’ line up to spell
the word.


Foundational Skills 1


- Ask the class to read the word.


- Have the class segment the word by saying the individual sounds. As they
are saying the individual sounds, the student with the spelling for that sound
should step forward.

  - Divide the class into two teams and have each team form a line.


  - Say a segmented word (e.g., “/s/ . . . /a/ . . . /t/”) and ask the first student in
each line to blend it.


  - The student who is first to blend the word correctly gets a point for his or her
team. Both students should then move to the back of their respective line.


  - If neither student can blend the word correctly, have both students move to
the back of their respective line and let the next students in line take a turn.


**Spelling Hopscotch**

  - Write a previously taught spelling for a vowel sound (e.g., ‘a’) on a circular
sheet of paper.


  - Write previously taught spellings for consonant sounds (e.g., ‘t’, ‘p’, ‘m’, ‘h’, and
‘n’) on oval or petal-shaped sheets of white paper. Affix the spellings securely
to the floor in a flower pattern.


  - Give a student a starting point, for example, the picture of the /t/ sound. Ask
the student to create a real or silly word by jumping to the center spelling and
then to a petal spelling. Possible words are _tap, tam, tan, pat, Pam, pan, mat,_
_map, man, hat, hap, ham, han, nat, nap, nam._


  - Make sure that students say the sound that the spelling stands for as they
jump on each one.


  - The other students should blend the word after the jumping student has
come to a halt.


  - You can also play this game outside on the playground.

 - Have students place the picture in the appropriate box.


 - Repeat with the remaining pictures.


 - Adapt the exercise for the sound pairs /e/ and /a/, /u/ and /o/, and /a/
and /u/.


 - **Variation:** Show students two pictures at a time, one with /i/ and one with
/e/. Have students identify the items and say what the vowel sound is in each
word. Then have students place the pictures in the appropriate boxes.


**Sister Sounds**

 - Follow the directions in Lesson 2 for /s/ and /z/ and Lesson 9 for /th/ and
/th/.


 - Adapt the directions in Lessons 2 and 9 for the sister sounds /p/ and /b/,
/t/ and /d/, /k/ and /g/, and /f/ and /v/.


**T-Charts**


**Note:** In this unit, a few sounds have been reviewed that can be hard to
distinguish. You should practice hearing the difference between /i/ and /e/,
/e/ and /a/, /a/ and /o/, /o/ and /u/, /p/ and /b/, /t/ and /d/, /k/ and /g/,
/m/ and /n/, /f/ and /v/, /sh/ and /ch/, /n/ and /ng/, /th/ and /f/, and /th/
and /v/ with students.


 - Select two similar sounds, for example /ch/ and /sh/, and gather pictures of
items that begin with either of these sounds.


 - Draw a chart with two columns on a piece of chart paper and write the basic
code spellings for the targeted sounds at the top of the chart.


 - Show students pairs of pictures, one starting with /sh/ and one with /ch/,
and ask students to identify the pictures and to say what the beginning
sounds are.


 - Have them place the pictures in the appropriate columns of the chart.


Foundational Skills 1



**206**


**Note:** The targeted sounds could also be at the end of the words (e.g., _peach_
and _fish_ ).


**Tap the Spelling**

  - Cut out a long, rectangular slip of paper and write a ‘v’ on each end. The
letters should face away from each other (see illustration). Repeat for ‘f’
and ‘t’.


  - Place the cards in a row on the floor between two students who are facing
each other.


  - Explain that you will say a number of sounds and that you want the students
to whack the correct spelling as fast as possible.


**Note:** You can play this game for all sounds reviewed in this unit. Choose
sounds that are similar, for example, /t/ and /d/, /f/ and /v/, /n/ and /ng/,
and /ch/ and /sh/.


~~**RECOGNIZE AND ISOLATE THE SOUNDS REVIEWED IN UNIT 1**~~


**Sound Search**

  - Say a sound and ask students to find an object in the classroom that begins
with that sound.


  - Help students find the first object.


  - When a student has found an object, have him or her show it to the other
students and say its name.


**Guess the Sound!**

  - Whisper a “secret sound” to a student and ask him or her to find an object in
the classroom that begins with that sound.


  - When the student points to the object, have the other students guess what
the “secret sound” was.


Pausing Point
**207**


**208**



**Hear Initial Sounds**

 - Choose a target sound (e.g., /t/) and tell students that you are going to say
a number of words. Some of the words will have the target sound as the first
sound and some will not.


 - Have students close their eyes and listen carefully.


 - Tell students to raise their hands when they hear a word that contains the
target sound.


 - **Variation:** The target sound can also be in the middle or at the end of
the words.


**Simon Says Sounds**

 - Give each student a set of teacher-made letter cards.


 - Play Simon Says, using commands such as:


   - Simon says, “Touch the picture that stands for the /p/ sound as in _pony_ .”


   - Simon says, “Touch the picture that stands for the /z/ sound as in _zip._ ”


   - Touch the picture that stands for the /t/ sound as in _toad_ . (Since Simon
did not say to touch it in the last command, students should not have
touched the picture.)


~~**MORE HELP WITH LETTER-SOUND CORRESPONDENCE**~~


**Sound/Spelling Review with Large Cards**

 - Pass out all or some of the Large Letter Cards.


 - Tell students that you will call out sounds and that you want the student with
a spelling for that sound to run to the front of the room and hold up the card.


**Note:** For some sounds more than one student will get up because of
spelling alternatives.


**Step Sounds**


 - Place two rows of 5–8 squares on the floor and have a student stand at the
head of each row.


 - Hold up a spelling for the first student and ask him or her to say the sound. If
the student says the correct sound, he or she moves one square forward.


 - Repeat this process, alternating between the two students.

~~**SAMPLE ANECDOTAL READING RECORD—UNIT 1**~~


**Name: T. Ellis**


**Lesson: 9 (Beth)**
Page 2: T. slowly sounded out the consonant clusters in ‘camp.’ Good pronunciation of the Tricky
Words. Page 4: Used the /o/ pronunciation for ‘of. P’ age 6: Self-corrected his pronunciation of ‘of. ’
More fluent on this page than the other two.


**Lesson: 10 (Kat and the Trip to the U.K)**
Page14: Held the ‘r’ in ‘trip’ for an extra beat (still taking an extra effort to decode clusters)
Page 16: Fluent reading until he got to ‘lunch.’


Recommendation: Encourage T. to blend words multiple times in order to build automatic
decoding with clusters.


**Lesson: 11 (Kat’s Pets)**
Some struggle with alternating ‘o’ sounds (‘from’ vs. ‘of’ vs. ‘to’). Successfully self-corrected on
‘of.’ Page 26: Successful decoding with halting phrasing; improving with clusters; he pronounced
‘cast’ smoothly.
Page 28: Decoded letter by letter for ‘splash,’ ‘munch,’ and ‘snacks.’ Successfully decoded
digraphs.
Page 30: Correctly decoded all of the words with slow, word by word reading.


Recommendation: Encourage T. to read story pages multiple times in order to build fluency and
rapid decoding.


**Lesson: 12** **(The Flag Shop)**
Page 32: Rapid decoding until he got to ‘One of the’; he may be paying extra attention to
underlined words. Letter by letter decoding of ‘French’ (correctly decoded ‘ch’).
Page 34: Misread ‘of’ /o/ /v/ first time but self-corrected when the word showed up again.

~~**THE SIMPLE VIEW OF READING**~~


Virtually everyone who writes about reading now recognizes that reading comprehension requires
more than just decoding ability. Many reading researchers now subscribe to a view of reading that is
known as “the simple view of reading.” This view, which is associated with reading researchers Philip
Gough and William Tunmer, holds that there are two chief elements that are crucially important to
reading comprehension: _decoding skills_ and _language comprehension ability_ .


To achieve reading comprehension, a person needs to be able to decode the words on the page
and then make sense of those words. The first task is made possible by decoding skills and the
second by language comprehension ability. If the person cannot decode the words on the page, he
or she will not be able to achieve reading comprehension, no matter how much oral language he
or she can understand. Even if the person _can_ decode the words on the page, that in and of itself is
still no guarantee of reading comprehension. If the sentences the person is attempting to read are
sentences he or she could not understand if they were read aloud to him or her, then there is not
much hope that he or she will understand them during independent reading.


Supporters of the simple view—and there are a growing number of them among reading
researchers—argue that a person’s reading comprehension ability can be predicted, with a
high degree of accuracy, based on two basic measures. The first is a measure of decoding skills
(e.g., a test of single-word reading or pseudoword reading). The second is a measure of listening
comprehension. Researchers who hold to the simple view say, “Tell me a person’s decoding ability,
as ascertained by a word-reading task, and tell me that person’s language comprehension ability,
as ascertained by a listening comprehension task, and I can make a very accurate prediction of that
person’s reading comprehension ability.” If the person is a rapid and accurate decoder and also able
to understand a wide range of oral language—for instance, classroom presentations, news items
on the radio or TV, books on tape, etc.—then it is a safe bet the person will also do well on tests of
reading comprehension.


**Appendix A**
**299**

An interesting thing about the simple view of reading is that it can be expressed as an equation:


**R = D x C**


In this equation, each of the letters is a variable that stands for a specific skill:


R is a measure of reading comprehension ability.


D is a measure of decoding skills.


C is a measure of language comprehension ability as measured using a listening task.


Each of these skills can be quantified as a numerical value between 0 and 1, where zero stands for
no ability whatsoever and 1 stands for perfect, not-to-be-improved-upon ability. Obviously most
people have a skill level that falls somewhere between these two extremes.


The equation says that if you have some decoding ability (D > 0) and you also have some language
comprehension ability (C > 0), you will probably also have some reading comprehension ability (R >
0). How much reading comprehension ability you have will depend on the exact values of D and C.


What does it mean to have no decoding ability (D = 0)? It means you cannot turn printed words into
spoken words. A person who cannot decode letters on a page cannot read. The person is illiterate.


What does it mean to have no language comprehension ability (C = 0)? Basically, it means you do
not know the language, and you cannot understand any of it when you hear other people speaking or
reading aloud in that language.


It is not very common for a person to have decoding ability (D > 0) but not language comprehension
ability (C = 0). Why would you learn to read and write a language you cannot understand? It does
happen. One famous example involves the English poet John Milton, the author of _Paradise Lost_ and
other well-known poems. Milton went blind late in life. Since Braille had not yet been invented, this
meant he could not read for himself. Nevertheless, Milton found a way to keep learning from books:
he had friends and relatives read the books aloud for him. However, he was not always able to find
a scholar who had the free time and the ability needed to read to him in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and
other ancient languages. The solution? Milton taught his daughters to decode these languages so
they could read books in those languages aloud to him. Milton did not teach his daughters the actual
languages—the thousands of words and tens of thousands of meanings _._ That would have been a
difficult, time-consuming task. He only taught them the rules they would need to turn letters into
sounds. Thus, his daughters acquired solid decoding skills for these languages (D > 0), but they
would have scored a zero on any measure of language comprehension (C = 0). They could turn
symbols into sounds, but they had no idea what the sounds meant. Milton, on the other hand, due
to his blindness, had no functional decoding skills (D = 0). However, by virtue of his great learning,


**Foundational Skills 1**


he was able to understand Hebrew, Latin, and Greek when they were read aloud to him (C > 0).
Between Milton and his daughters, you might say, there was reading comprehension (R), but the
younger generation brought the decoding skills (D) and the elderly poet brought the language
comprehension (C).


The Milton example is an unusual one, but it is possible to give a less unusual one. A decent teacher
can teach you to decode Russian letters (or the letters used in many other writing systems) in the
course of a couple days of intensive work. Since you already know a lot about reading, all you would
need to learn is which sound values the unfamiliar letters stand for. Once you learned that, you
would be able to sound out most of the words in the language, but nobody would claim that you are
_reading_ Russian. You would have some rudimentary decoding skills (D > 0), but you would be lacking
language comprehension (C = 0). You would be able to pronounce words, but you would not be able
to make sense of them. Essentially, you would be doing what Milton’s daughters did.


~~**HOW THESE IDEAS INFORM THIS PROGRAM**~~


Although this may seem very abstract and theoretical, there are two ideas here that are very
important for reading instruction and for understanding this program. The first important idea
is that reading comprehension depends crucially on both decoding skills (D) and language
comprehension ability (C); the second is that language comprehension ability takes much longer to
acquire than decoding skills.


Milton chose to teach his daughters decoding skills because he could teach those relatively quickly.
It would have taken him much, much longer to build up their language comprehension abilities.
Likewise, in the hypothetical example just given, a decent teacher could teach you to decode
Russian print in a few days of intensive instruction, but he or she would need to keep working with
you for many weeks—possibly even many years—to teach you enough Russian words and phrases to
understand a movie, make sense of a radio report, or read a short story.


You are facing a similar situation as a teacher in the early grades. You want your students to learn
to read. A crucial first step is to teach them decoding skills. Strong decoding skills can be taught to
most young children over the course of Grades K–2. It takes longer to teach decoding skills to young
children who are learning to read for the first time than it does to teach the same skills to adults
who have already learned to read in another language, and it takes longer to teach decoding skills in
English-speaking countries because English spelling is rather complex; but even so, most students
can acquire basic decoding ability in the early grades. The children will continue to automatize their
decoding skills, learn new spelling patterns, and build fluency for many more years, but the basics
can be taught in Grades K–2.


That is not the case with language comprehension ability. It is going to take you and your school
system a long time to build up your students’ language comprehension ability because this is not a
job you can accomplish in the course of a single school year. Rather, language comprehension ability
is acquired over many years. Your students began to develop a rudimentary ability to understand
language even before they could speak and continued to increase their language comprehension


**Appendix A**
**301**

abilities throughout the preschool years. They will make even more gains in your classroom and the
classrooms they join after yours. With each new sentence they read or hear, and each new subject
they study in school, they will be building up background knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural literacy,
and thus increasing the range of materials they are equipped to understand; first orally and later via
reading. The more you teach them and the more you expose them to, the more they will be able to
understand. It takes a long time to build up the vocabulary and knowledge needed to make sense
of most stories in a newspaper or magazine, but this buildup is crucial for your students’ reading
abilities: for no matter how good their decoding skills may be, they will not understand what they read
unless they have the language comprehension ability to make sense of the words they decode.


This program includes two strands of instruction, and these strands correspond with the
elements of reading isolated in the simple view of reading. The Skills Strand is meant to build
students’ decoding skills (D), while the Knowledge Strand is meant to build students’ language
comprehension ability (C) by exposing them to vocabulary, concepts, and ideas through frequent
reading aloud. It is important to understand that _both strands are crucial for reading comprehension_
_in later grades_ . You may feel the decoding skills taught in the Skills Strand are more important
to teach in the early grades, and certainly this is the area where you can expect to have the most
immediate impact, but it is important that you not neglect language comprehension ability.
Remember, it takes many years to build up enough vocabulary and general knowledge to understand
a wide range of printed materials. The building of background knowledge needs to begin in
Kindergarten (if not before) and continue throughout the elementary and middle school years.


If students are not building their language comprehension ability in the early grades, their reading
scores are likely to begin to fall off in Grade 4 and later. This has been called the “fourth-grade
slump,” and it occurs because material assessed on reading tests changes over time. As students
progress through the grades, test questions focus less on rudimentary decoding skills and more
on comprehension—and comprehension depends on having sufficient vocabulary, background
knowledge, and cultural literacy to understand the words you are decoding. Thus, the importance
of language comprehension ability increases with time. A weakness in this area may not show up on
tests in early grades, but it will show up in later elementary grades.


This has been well documented in research. In one very interesting study, researchers at the
University of Kansas looked at measurements of reading comprehension (R), decoding/word
recognition (D), and listening comprehension (C) for the same 570 students in second, fourth,
and eighth grades. They found the two factors D and C accurately predicted R in each grade,
but that C became more important, in the sense that it explained more of the variation among
students over time. The measure of decoding (D) was extremely important in the second-grade
results. Twenty-seven percent of the variance in reading comprehension in second grade could be
explained by decoding skills (D) alone. Only 9 percent of the variance could be explained by listening
comprehension (C) alone. By fourth grade, however, the measure of listening comprehension
had begun to account for more variance: the unique contribution of C rose to 21 percent while
the equivalent number for D fell. By eighth grade, fully 36 percent of the variance in reading
comprehension scores could be explained with reference to the children’s listening comprehension


**Foundational Skills 1**


ability. The unique contribution of D sank even further. In other words, while reading comprehension
depended on D and C at every stage, as the simple view would predict, C explained more and more
of the variation among students as time went by. What this tells us is that, once the intricacies of
decoding are mastered (and in English this takes some time), reading comprehension depends more
and more heavily on language comprehension. Language comprehension depends on background
knowledge, vocabulary, and cultural literacy.


~~**TWO MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT READING AND WRITING**~~


The Skills Strand teaches the mechanics of both reading and writing. It is based on the most current
research on reading and writing, but at the same time it has been written in opposition to some
ideas that have been very influential in elementary education in recent decades. Two of those ideas
are:


  - Learning to read and write is natural.


  - Learning to read and write is easy.


Both of these ideas have great emotional appeal. Unfortunately, both of them are wrong.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT NATURAL**~~


Many scholars have argued that spoken language is natural for human beings. The cognitive
scientist Stephen Pinker, for example, has argued that human beings have a language instinct,
meaning that humans are born with an innate capacity for learning language. This may turn out to
be true. It is at least a plausible theory since historians, linguists, and anthropologists have never
found a human culture that does not use language. When something is universal, it may turn out to
be natural.


What is true of oral language is not necessarily true of written language. In fact, with written
language, we know we are dealing with something that is not natural or innate because we know
when and where writing was invented, and we know that, even today, not all languages have a
system of writing. There are still hundreds of languages in the world that are spoken, but not written
or read.


Ten thousand years ago this was the norm, rather than an exception. At that time, there were
probably no human beings who knew how to read or write. According to the linguist Florian
Coulmas, the idea of writing down language was probably developed independently by three ancient
cultures: the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, and the Chinese. Each used a slightly different system, and
the mechanisms these pioneers developed for recording speech then spread from one culture to
another, evolving as they went. If these initial inventors had not come up with schemes for writing
down speech, we might all be illiterate today.


**Appendix A**
**303**


**304**



Writing is many things. It is an art that can be taught and learned. It is an invention—one of the
greatest inventions in human history. It is a technology enabling us to do things we could not do
without it—a technology every bit as exciting and amazing as airplane flight or electric power. But
it is not natural. The same is true of reading, which is simply the process of unpacking, or decoding,
what somebody else has written.


Reading and writing are both highly artificial. We tend to recoil at that word. We have internalized the
idea that natural is good and artificial is bad. Therefore, we think, reading must be natural. In fact, as
the reading researcher Philip Gough has written, reading is a highly unnatural act.


The first step toward good reading and writing instruction is to understand that reading and writing
are artificial—but not necessarily in a bad sense. We need to remind ourselves the word _artificial_
derives from the word _art_ . To say reading and writing are forms of art that had to be invented and
need to be taught to children does not make reading and writing any less wonderful or important.
On the contrary, it makes these things more wonderful and precious, and it also emphasizes the
importance of your job as a teacher. There is no job more important than teaching young children
the magnificent, valuable, and highly unnatural arts of reading and writing.


~~**LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS NOT EASY**~~


The second idea noted earlier, that learning to read and write is easy, is also mistaken. Reading and
writing are complex behaviors, and they are more complex in English than in many other languages
because English has a fairly complicated spelling system. In Spanish, for example, the relationships
between letters and sounds are mostly one to one, meaning each sound is usually written with one
spelling, and each spelling unit is usually pronounced one way. This is not the case in English. In
order to read and write English with a high degree of accuracy, there is quite a lot that students need
to learn.


As a way of demonstrating the complexity involved in learning to read and write in English, suppose
we attempted to list all of the discrete bits of information a person needs to know in order to be able
to read and write in English. As a starting point, we might begin with the 26 letters and argue that
these are the 26 things one really needs to learn to read and write English. However, for each letter,
one eventually needs to learn not only the letter shape but also the letter name (in order to be able
to read abbreviations and initials). So that is 52 bits of information.


That is a good start, but we must not stop there. In English, all letters can be written in uppercase
and lowercase forms, and the uppercase forms are not always the same as the lowercase forms.
Compare B to b, D to d, H to h, R to r, Q to q. At least 16 uppercase letters have a slightly different
form than the matching lowercase letters. So we must raise our estimate of the complexity of the
English writing system to 68 bits of information.


We are not done yet. Students must also know the 44 sounds these letters stand for. That raises our
estimate of the complexity to 112.


**Foundational Skills 1**


If there were a simple one-to-one relationship between letters and sounds, that might be a fairly
good estimate of the complexity of the code. Unfortunately, the relationships between sounds and
letters in English are quite complicated. The 44 sounds of English can be spelled many different
ways. In our work on this program we have identified 150 spellings that are frequent enough to be
worth teaching in the early grades. That boosts our estimate of the complexity of the code to 262.


In addition, students need to learn to track from left to right, to blend sounds into words (when
reading), and segment words into sounds (when writing and spelling). They need to learn a handful
of symbols used in writing, including the period, comma, exclamation point, question mark,
quotation mark, and apostrophe. That raises our estimate of code complexity to about 270 bits of
information.


We could boost the estimate even higher by adding Tricky Words and unusual spellings or by
pointing out that there are many letters in English that can be pronounced different ways. We could
also point out that reading a word like _thin_ requires students to group the first two letters and attach
them to one sound, and reading a word like _cake_ requires students to scan ahead, see the ‘e’, and
realize it controls the pronunciation of the ‘a’ earlier.


Even without these additions it is clear that the English writing system is quite complicated.


~~**THE PROBLEM WITH WHOLE LANGUAGE**~~


On a conservative estimate, there are 270 bits of knowledge a person needs to be able to read and
write English. It is unwise to ask students to tackle all of this complexity at once and hope they will
figure it out. Yet that is precisely what is done in so-called “Whole Language” approaches. Whole
Language instruction is based on the assumption that learning to read is natural, and not difficult,
so reading skills can be allowed to develop gradually, without much explicit instruction. Lots of
students in Whole Language classrooms do manage to figure out the English writing system, but
many others do not. Whole Language ideas have tremendous emotional appeal, but the Whole
Language approach is actually a recipe for _leaving many children behind._ It is an especially risky
strategy for disadvantaged children.


A much better strategy is to introduce the English spelling code explicitly, beginning with the
easiest, least ambiguous, and most frequently used parts of the code and then adding complexity
gradually. That is the central strategy on which this program is based.


The strategy adopted in this program is the same strategy that successful coaches use when
teaching children a sport such as tennis. The successful coach does not ask students to learn
“Whole Tennis” and soak up the necessary skills all at once by trying to hit all different kinds of
shots the first day on the court. Instead, the successful coach teaches the student to hit a forehand
ground stroke and provides lots of practice hitting forehands. Then the coach moves on to teach
a backhand ground stroke, then a forehand volley, then a backhand volley, then a serve, then an
overhead smash, then a drop shot, etc. With each element taught, the student becomes a stronger


**Appendix A**
**305**


**306**



and more complete player. In the same way, this program begins by teaching the most common and
least ambiguous spellings for sounds and then moves on to introduce the more complex parts of the
writing system


~~**KEY ASPECTS OF THE SKILLS STRAND**~~


Some key aspects of the Skills Strand are listed below.


 - The program teaches reading and writing in tandem, since they are inverse processes. English writing
involves making pictures of sounds; reading involves translating those pictures back into sounds and
blending the sounds to make words.


 - The program rejects the Whole Language notion that exposure to rich language and lots of
environmental print is sufficient to ensure mastery of the writing system.


 - The program explicitly teaches letter-sound correspondences as opposed to leaving students to
figure these out on their own or deduce them by analyzing familiar whole words (as in some forms of
“analytic” phonics).


 - The program focuses on sounds, or phonemes, as the primary organizing principle of the program,
rather than letters.


 - The program includes phonics instruction, but the instruction differs from the phonics usually taught
in the United States in that it begins with sounds and then attaches those sounds to spellings. In a
typical phonics lesson in the United States, the teacher writes the letter ‘m’ on the board and says,
“This is the letter ‘em’. It says /m/.” As a teacher using this program, you will be asked to present your
lessons in a different way. You will be asked to begin with the sound. At the beginning of the lesson
you will tell the class: “Today’s sound is /m/.” You will lead the class in some engaging oral language
exercises that will allow students to say and hear the sound /m/. Once students are familiar with the
sound, you will show them how to draw a “picture of the sound.” You will write the letter ‘m’ on the
board and explain that this is how we make a picture of the /m/ sound.


 - The program focuses consistently on the phoneme, or single sound, and not on larger units. Students
learn to read words that contain onsets, rimes, and consonant clusters, but they learn to view and
process these larger units as combinations of smaller phoneme-level units. Rimes like _–ick_ and initial
clusters like _st–_ are not taught as units but as combinations.


 - The program uses a synthetic phonics approach that teaches students to read by blending through
the whole word; it does not teach multiple cueing strategies, use of pictures as a primary resource in
decoding, or part-word guessing.


 - The program begins by teaching the most common or least ambiguous spelling for a sound (the
basic code spelling); later it teaches spelling alternatives for sounds that can be spelled several
different ways. Thus, the system is kept simple at first and complexity is added bit by bit as students
gain confidence and automatize their reading and writing skills.


**Foundational Skills 1**


  - The program includes words, phrases, and stories for students to read and activity pages for them to
complete that allow for focused, distributed practice working with the letter-sound correspondences
students have been taught.


  - The program does not require students to read words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have been taught. In other words, all words students are asked to read as
part of the program are decodable, either because they are composed entirely of letter-sound
correspondences students have been taught or because they are Tricky Words that have been
taught. This means students have a chance to begin reading words and stories that are completely
decodable before tackling words and stories that are full of spelling alternatives.


  - The program does not require students to write words that go beyond the letter-sound
correspondences they have been taught. In other words, students are only asked to write words that
can be spelled (at least plausibly if not always correctly) using the code knowledge they have been
taught.


  - The program carefully controls the introduction of Tricky Words and words with ambiguous or rare
spellings in Kindergarten, preferring to have students learn to read and write with regular words that
can be blended and spelled in accordance with the letter-sound correspondences taught.


  - The program avoids letter names in the early lessons of Kindergarten, because what is important
for reading is not the letter name but the sound value the letter stands for. To read the word _cat_, it is
essential to know /k/ /a/ /t/, not “see aay tee.”


  - The program teaches lowercase letters first and introduces the uppercase letters later.


~~**THE BASIC AND ADVANCED CODE**~~


This program teaches the highly complex letter-sound correspondences of the English language
in an explicit and systematic manner in Kindergarten–Grade 2. Students are taught how the 26
letters (or graphemes) of the alphabet are used in various combinations to represent 44 sounds (or
phonemes). There are approximately 150 different spellings for these sounds.


Students are first taught the **Basic Code** for each of the 44 phonemes. The Basic Code spelling
for a sound is usually the most common, or the least ambiguous, spelling for a sound. By learning
these letter-sound correspondences first, students experience a high degree of predictability, and
therefore success, in decoding words with these spellings.


Basic Code spellings may be single letters, such as these spellings and sounds: ‘a’ > /a/, ‘e’ > /e/, ‘b’

 - /b/, ‘m’ > /m/. Basic Code spellings may also include digraphs or two letters to represent a sound,
such as ‘ee’ > / ee/, ‘oy’ > /oi/, ‘ou’ > /ow/, ‘sh’ > /sh/, ‘th’ > /th/. Other Basic Code spellings include
separated digraphs, such as ‘a_e’ > /ae/, ‘o_e’ > /oe/.


In a **Basic Code Lesson**, students first learn to listen for and isolate a single sound and are then
taught the spelling for that sound. Typically in this type of lesson, the teacher introduces the sound


**Appendix A**
**307**


**308**



and conducts various oral language activities with the students to be certain that they can identify
the sound orally. The teacher then presents the spelling for that sound and models writing the
spelling, as well as sounding out simple one-syllable words that use the spelling. Additional reading
and writing practice opportunities for students then follow.


The **Advanced Code** consists of all other spelling alternatives (over 100) that may be used to
spell the 44 phonemes in English. Examples of alternative spellings include ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘ss’> /s/,
‘c’ > /s/, ‘g’ > /j/, ‘ay’ > /ae/, and ‘ey’ > /ee/. Some of these spelling alternatives occur relatively
frequently in the English language, while others are quite rare. See the provided charts for the Basic
and Advanced Code.


As each spelling alternative is taught, the frequency with which students may expect the spelling to
occur is communicated in several ways. A “power bar” on cards used to teach the spellings indicates
how frequent or infrequent a spelling is. A long power bar indicates the spelling occurs frequently,
while a short bar designates a rarer spelling.


The long power bar on the card below indicates that the ‘a’ spelling is used frequently to spell /a/,
the short vowel sound:


The short power bar on this card signals that the ‘eigh’ spelling is used infrequently to spell /ae/:


**Foundational Skills 1**


Students are introduced to and practice the **Advanced Code** in two types of lessons, **Spelling**
**Alternative Lessons** and **Tricky Spelling Lessons** . Whereas Skills instruction in Kindergarten
focuses almost entirely on the Basic Code, much instructional time in Grades 1 and 2 is devoted
to teaching **Spelling Alternatives** . In a **Spelling Alternative Lesson**, the teacher first reviews
the Basic Code spelling that students have already learned for a particular sound. New words
with different spellings for the same sound are then introduced. Students are then often asked to
conduct word sorts as a way to reinforce the fact that the same sound may be spelled multiple ways.
In Grades 1 and 2, teachers are also encouraged to display Spelling Trees in the classroom as yet
another way to reinforce spelling alternatives. A given sound is listed on the tree trunk, with various
branches standing for different spellings. Leaves with words exemplifying a spelling are placed on
the appropriate branches.











**Tricky Spelling Lessons** are used to explicitly call students’ attention to a spelling that can be
pronounced and read more than one way. For example, ‘a’ can be pronounced as /a/ ( _cat_ ), /ae/
( _paper_ ), /o/ ( _father_ ) or /ə/ ( _about_ ). It may be helpful to think of a tricky spelling as an instance in
which several sounds “vie” for the student to pronounce and read the spelling a different way.


**Appendix A**
**309**


**310**



In a **Tricky Spelling Lesson**, the teacher calls explicit attention to many examples of words in which
the same spelling is pronounced different ways. Students are taught to try each pronunciation that
they have learned for a spelling until they recognize a particular pronunciation as a familiar word
that makes sense in the context. Some **tricky spellings** are taught in Grade 1, with many more
taught in Grade 2.

~~**THE TRICKY WORD LESSON**~~


A final lesson type is the Tricky Word Lesson. The term _Tricky Word_ is used in this program to refer to
a word that does not “play by the rules” of spelling and/or pronunciation. Examples of Tricky Words
include _one_, _said_, _of_, _were_, and _have_ .


You can describe the trickiness of a Tricky Word like _said_ in two ways. If you think about it from a
spelling point of view, you might say that the word _said_ is tricky because the sound /e/ is not spelled
with an ‘e’, as you might expect it would be. On the other hand, if you think about it from a reading
point of view, you might say the word is tricky because the letters ‘ai’ are not pronounced /ae/, as
you might expect they would be. Either way you look at it, _said_ is a Tricky Word.


But notice that the word is not completely irregular, either. The first letter and the last letter are
pronounced exactly as you would expect. It is only the second and third letters, representing the
vowel sound, that are not sounded as you would expect. Or, if you prefer to look at things from the
speller’s perspective, you might say the first and last sound are spelled just as you would expect; it
is only the middle sound—the vowel sound—that is spelled irregularly. This is the case with many
Tricky Words: most of them have a regular part (or parts) and then a tricky part. More often than
not, you will find the tricky part involves the vowel sound and its spelling.


When you are asked to teach a Tricky Word, the guidelines in the Teacher Guide will generally prompt
you to begin by reminding students that not all words play by the rules and words that do not play
by the rules are called Tricky Words. Next, the Teacher Guide will generally suggest you write the
Tricky Word on the board. You may wish to ask a student to read the word as he or she thinks it
might be sounded (i.e., to blend according to the normal procedures). Alternatively, you can read the
Tricky Word that way yourself. Then you can point out how the word is actually pronounced. Once
you have established the actual pronunciation, you can point out and/or discuss what is regular and
what is irregular about the word. Most Tricky Words have at least some parts pronounced exactly the
way you would expect. For example, as noted above, the first and last letter in _said_ are pronounced
just as one would expect. After discussing the regular parts, you should then draw attention to the
tricky part (or parts) of the word, pointing out letters not pronounced as one might expect they
would be (e.g., the ‘ai’ in _said_ ). This is the part of the word that students just have to remember.


By drawing attention to the regular as well as the irregular parts of the word, you teach students
that Tricky Words are only partial exceptions to the normal rules of reading and writing. (They are
not so much irregular as they are a little less regular than most words.) There are some parts of the
word spelled just as you would expect and also pronounced just as you would expect. Then there are
some others that are not. There is a subtle but important difference between teaching Tricky Words
this way and teaching them as single entities that have to be memorized as wholes, as if every part
of the word were unpredictable.


Note that some Tricky Words are actually part of spelling patterns. For example, the words _he_, _she_,
_we_, _be_, and _me_, are taught as Tricky Words early on because it is hard to write stories without them.


**Appendix A**
**313**


**314**



However, once the ‘e’ spelling alternative for /ee/ is taught, these Tricky Words can be seen as part
of a larger pattern that includes words like _replay_ and _prefix_ . Other Tricky Words, such as _one_ and _of_,
remain tricky even when most of the spelling alternatives have been taught.


It is important to note that Tricky Words are not the same as sight words. The distinction is
discussed in the next few sections.


~~**SIGHT WORDS AND TRICKY WORDS**~~


One of the most common terms in the world of reading instruction is _sight word_ . Unfortunately, this
is also a rather ambiguous and potentially confusing term. Educators use the term _sight word_ in
two different senses. For some people, sight words are high-frequency words that students need to
encounter frequently and learn to decode rapidly and effortlessly. Other people use the term _sight_
_word_ in a more restrictive sense, to refer to words that cannot be sounded out using letter-sound
correspondences and may need to be taught as exceptions.


In this program, we distinguish between _Tricky Words_ and _sight words_ . We define these terms as
follows:


 - A _Tricky Word_, as noted in the previous section, is a word that does not play by the rules. It is a word
containing at least one part that cannot be read correctly via blending or cannot be spelled correctly
using the code knowledge taught so far.


 - A _sight word_ is a high-frequency word that we want students to see many, many times and learn to
read quickly.


The main difference here is that a Tricky Word always contains some irregular element, whereas a
sight word might or might not. The Venn diagram below shows the relationship between these two
categories, as understood within this program.


**Foundational Skills 1**


The words in the left circle are Tricky Words: each one contains at least one set of letters that is not
pronounced the way you would expect. Or, if you prefer to look at matters from a spelling point of
view, you could say each contains at least one sound that is not written as you would expect it to be.


The words in the right circle are sight words: they are all high-frequency words that students should
see frequently and eventually learn to recognize rapidly.


The shaded area in the middle shows that there is considerable overlap between the two categories

regular. All of them are pronounced and spelled exactly as you would expect. They can be sounded

**316**



out and set down on paper using basic letter-sound correspondences taught in Kindergarten.
Students need to see these words—and they will see most of them frequently in materials for this
program—but you probably do not need to give these words special attention and you certainly
should not ask students to memorize them as wholes. Students can simply read them by sounding
them out. After sounding them out several times, they will begin to recognize them more rapidly.
In other words, no special teaching is required for these regular high-frequency words. All that is
required is multiple exposures, and students are likely to get multiple exposures since the words are
so common.


~~**SIGHT WORDS**~~


The guidelines for teaching Tricky Words are outlined in the section above. As noted above, we use
the term _sight word_ in this program to refer to high-frequency words that we want students to see
many, many times and learn to recognize rapidly.


This program does place the initial emphasis on reading regular words. But that does not mean
high-frequency sight words are not being learned. In fact, as noted above, many sight words are
completely regular and become decodable as students learn letter-sound correspondences. This
means that this is a very effective program for teaching sight words.


To illustrate this, consider one of the most widely used lists of sight words, Dr. Edward Fry’s “Instant
Word” list. Fry’s list is divided into groups of 100. For purposes of illustration, we will focus on the
first three lists of 100 words, 300 words in all. These are words that Fry recommends be mastered
in the first several grades of school. We found more than half of the Fry Instant Words become fully
decodable in Kindergarten, meaning they are either regular and can be sounded out using the lettersound correspondences taught, or they are Tricky Words explicitly taught in the program.


By the end of Unit 3, four of Fry’s Instant Words are 100% decodable: _at_, _did_, _got_, _it_ .


By the end of Unit 4, 16 Instant Words are 100% decodable: _can_, _an_, _and_, _not_, _in_, _on_, _man_, _him_, _had_,
_if_, _its_, _get_, _end_, _men_, _set_, _sit_ .


By the end of Unit 10 in Kindergarten, 129 high frequency words (41 Tricky Words, plus 88 decodable
words) from the Fry Instant Word List have been taught. Using the Dolch Sight Word List as criteria,
by the end of Unit 10, 116 high frequency words (42 Tricky Words, plus 74 decodable words) from
the Dolch List have been taught. Many of these Tricky Words are practiced and reviewed in Grade 1
Units 1 and 2.


**Foundational Skills 1**


~~**CUSTOMIZING AND ADAPTING THE PROGRAM**~~


This is a highly structured and sequenced program. We are unapologetic about that, as we believe
the structure and sequence will be very helpful to students as they work to learn the English spelling
code. However, this is not a scripted program in which teachers are required to read the manual and
give one of a handful of approved responses. We expect—indeed, we hope—teachers will tweak the
phrasing and come up with ways to customize, personalize, and adapt the instruction.


Our goal has been to put things in a logical order and provide all of the guidance and support
necessary for a new teacher, or a teacher new to this kind of phonics instruction.


At the same time we believe there is room for experienced and creative teachers to customize and
adapt the program. Indeed, some of the exercises included in this version of the program were
developed by teachers in our pilot programs!


Sometimes in the lessons we give exact phrasing that we suggest you use; more often, however, we
give indirect phrasing and/or encourage you to explain something using your own words. You should
feel free to make changes to the phrasing. For example, you may prefer to speak of “a picture of a
sound” or a “spelling.” Later in the year, you may want to teach the term “digraph,” or you may prefer
to refer to the letters in a digraph as a “letter team” or as “buddy letters.” There are many ways to
customize the program and the language while preserving the basic instructional principles and
sequence of instruction.


For presentation of words, you may write on a chalkboard, a white board, chart paper, an overhead
projector, a document camera or the projection system of your choice. A projection system works
especially well for activity pages, since it allows the teacher to model the task exactly as the
students will be completing it. For the chaining exercises, you may use a pocket chart, a magnetic
board with magnetic letters, an overhead projector with letters cut from a transparency, or an
interactive whiteboard. Many modifications of this sort can be made without adversely impacting
the quality of the instruction.


You should also always feel free to add additional activities and activity pages that are consistent
with our philosophy of instruction. You should always feel free to respond to the teachable moment,
even if it leads you slightly off the path laid out in the Teacher Guide.


There are only a handful of things you should not do:


**Appendix A**
**317**


**318**



You should not skip a lesson in which new code knowledge is taught. If you are not able to teach
Lesson 12 on Monday, teach it on Tuesday. If you are not able to teach it on Tuesday, teach it on
Wednesday. Do not try to “catch up” by skipping ahead to Lesson 14. If you do, students will be
lacking important code knowledge, untaught spellings will begin to appear in their word lists and on
their activity pages, and the lessons will start to make less sense to them.


For the same reasons, you should not reorder the lessons. The program relies heavily on sequencing,
and instruction will be confused and less effective if the lessons are reordered.


~~**SMALL GROUP WORK**~~


Large parts of this program have been written for whole-group instruction, but the program can be
customized to allow for small-group instruction of various kinds. Since all students need to learn
that /t/ is spelled ‘t’, it is instructionally efficient to teach the Basic Code Lessons and other lessons
that introduce the letter-sound correspondences to the whole class. You will note that there are
Support and Challenge sidebars sprinkled throughout the lessons, as well as the Additional Support
activities at the end of each lesson, that will guide you in how to differentiate instruction for your
students, while still using the whole class approach described in the Basic Code Lessons.


However, since some students will learn the new information right away while others will need
more practice, you may wish to do small-group work to follow up the initial introduction of code
knowledge. You will note that many lessons do include suggestions for small group; you should feel
free to adapt these and other lessons as best meets the needs of your students. We have seen this
program taught very effectively in small groups and in workstations students visit on rotation.


~~**ADJUSTING THE SPEED OF INSTRUCTION**~~


This sequence will work for most children. However, all children are different, and all classrooms are
different. Some classrooms may need more time to master particular concepts than others. The
program has been designed so the pace of instruction can be adjusted as needed.


The most important thing for you to know is that _you can pause at any point in the program_ .
If students are not learning the material, simply stop where you are and do additional work to
remediate or reteach as needed. All lessons contain some materials you can use if you pause.


**Foundational Skills 1**


In addition, at the end of each unit there is a “Pausing Point.” If the end-of-unit assessment or your
observations suggest some members of the class need additional time to master the concepts
taught in the unit, this is an especially good place to stop and provide additional practice and
review. The Teacher Guides include additional work at each Pausing Point. They will typically provide
enough for at least 4–5 days of additional work. The materials provided in the Pausing Point can be
used in various ways. Sometimes you may wish to have all students do the same activity or activity
page. Other times you may wish to work individually or in small groups with students who are
struggling with a particular concept.


To slow down instruction, you can pause either in the middle of a unit or at a Pausing Point. We do
not recommend that you attempt to speed up the sequence of instruction. The program lays out an
ambitious program of instruction.


~~**GROUPING AND PULL-OUT INSTRUCTION**~~


The Grade 1 program of instruction should work well for a wide range of students. You should begin
with the assumption that the Grade 1 program is an appropriate option for all students in the class.


Inevitably, however, there will be differences in learning. Students learn at different rates. Some
students will pick up the material quickly, others will have more difficulty. There are many strategies
for dealing with this. In general, we encourage you to try to keep most of the class together as long
as it makes sense to do so. It is much easier to teach one set of students at roughly the same level
than it is to teach two or three groups at very different levels.


If you find some students are lagging, you may still be able to keep the class together for the main
lessons but find extra time two to four times a week to work with those students who seem to need
extra practice. The various chaining activities are especially good to do in these remedial groups.


If this is not sufficient, you may eventually need to regroup some students. As we note in Lessons
6–10 of this unit, it is especially important to administer the placement assessment to all students
at the start of the year. We strongly recommend that teachers then use an “across grade” approach
to grouping students. If there are two classrooms, these two teachers should look at all of the Grade
1 students in both classrooms and consider regrouping students for Skills instruction only, with one
teacher taking the class of students who need review and more practice, while the other teacher
works with those students ready to move on to Grade 1 Skills instruction. It will likely be worthwhile
to reconvene at multiple times during the year to plan across the grade level, using the end-of-unit
assessments. In this way, students in need of remediation can be moved to the appropriate group,
while students who are making progress can advance.
