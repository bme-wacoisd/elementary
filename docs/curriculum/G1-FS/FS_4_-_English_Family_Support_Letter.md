# **Welcome!**
## Grade 1, Unit 4 Foundational Skills

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will be introduced to r-controlled vowel sounds, the concept of a syllable, and past-tense verbs,

and they will continue working on descriptive and informational writing.


**What** **will** **my** **student** **learn?**


Students will learn the following r-controlled vowel sounds: /er/ spelled ‘er’, as in _her_ ; /ar/ spelled ‘ar’, as in _car_ ; and

/or/ spelled ‘or’, as in _for_ . Students will practice recognizing the sound/spelling patterns they have learned and begin

decoding two-syllable words. Students will learn with oral practice first and then encounter these skills in the

Activity Book and Reader, _The_ _Green_ _Fern_ _Zoo_ . Students will work on grammar by being introduced to past-tense

verb forms ending with _–ed_ . They will also review nouns, verbs, and adjectives. They will use the Reader to practice

thinking about the five senses to describe objects, and they will then describe and write an informational text about

an animal from the text.
