**Grade 1 | Foundational Skills 5**
Introduction


~~**UNIT 5 OVERVIEW**~~


**Spelling Alternatives**


In this unit you will begin teaching the spelling alternatives that make up the advanced code. Up
to this point, students have mostly been learning the basic code. They have learned one way to
write each of the sounds in English, with the exception of /zh/. They have learned only a handful of
spelling alternatives:


  - the ‘k’ spelling for /k/ as in _kite_ (an alternative for ‘c’ as in _cat_ )


  - the double-letter spellings for consonant sounds (‘ff’ as in _stuff_, ‘ll’ as in _bell_, ‘ss’ as in _dress_, ‘ck’ as in
_black_, etc.)


  - the ‘s’ spelling for /z/ as in _is_ and _dogs_


  - the ‘ed’ spelling as a past-tense marker for /d/ as in _filled_ and for /t/ as in _asked_


There are many more spelling alternatives to learn. In this unit and the next, the focus is on spelling
alternatives for consonant sounds. These are less numerous and also less frequently used than the
spelling alternatives for vowel sounds, which will be addressed later in the sequence of instruction.


Here are the sounds and spellings that are either reviewed or introduced in this unit:


  - /p/ spelled ‘p’ and ‘pp’ (review)


  - /b/ spelled ‘b’ and ‘bb’ (review)


  - /k/ spelled ‘c’, ‘k’, ‘cc’, and ‘ck’ (review)


  - /g/ spelled ‘g’ and ‘gg’ (review)


  - /ch/ spelled ‘ch’ (review) and **‘tch’ (new)**


  - /j/ spelled ‘j’ (review), **‘g’**, and **‘ge’ (new)**


  - /t/ spelled ‘t’, ‘tt’, and ‘ed’ (review)


  - /d/ spelled ‘d’, ‘dd’, and ‘ed’ (review)


  - /f/ spelled ‘f’ and ‘ff’ (review)


Introduction
**1**


     - /v/ spelled ‘v’ (review) and **‘ve’ (new)**


     - /r/ spelled ‘r’ (review) and **‘wr’ (new)**


      - /l/ spelled ‘l’ and ‘ll’ (review)


The majority of the spellings covered in this unit are review items. For example, consonant sounds
that can be written with single- or double-letter spellings are review.


Note that the sounds have been organized and sequenced according to place of articulation, so
sister sounds like /p/ and /b/ are taught on consecutive days. The unvoiced sound is taught first
and the voiced sound is taught the following day. These groupings may be helpful because /p/ is the
sound students are mostly likely to confuse with /b/, and vice versa. In some cases, sister sounds
actually share spellings. For example, ‘ed’ is a spelling for both /d/ and /t/.


There is relatively little new code knowledge taught in this unit. That is deliberate. The hope is that
this unit and the next one will give students a chance to ease into the world of spelling alternatives
while they consolidate their knowledge of the basic code and have an opportunity to practice
reading two-syllable words.


**The Spelling Alternatives Lesson**


Beginning in this unit and continuing until the end of the year, you will frequently teach what in this
program is called the Spelling Alternatives Lesson. Each Spelling Alternatives Lesson begins with
a note to the teacher in Advance Preparation. This note is meant to give you some background
knowledge concerning the sound of the day and its spellings. A chart shows you which spellings for
this sound are most common, and a list of bullet points identifies some common spelling patterns
for the sound. The bulleted information is primarily for your information; there is no expectation
that you will convey all of it to students. You might offer little bits of it, if and when occasions present
themselves.


The first exercise in the lesson is usually an oral language exercise that involves hearing and saying
the sound. After students have had a chance to hear and say the sound, you will (1) review the basic
code spelling, (2) review any spelling alternatives introduced previously, and (3) introduce any new
spelling alternatives.


After you have introduced the spelling alternatives, you will ask students to do a word sort. Many
of these word sorts take the form of Spelling Trees for each sound. The Spelling Trees are fantastic
visual representations of the power bars for each spelling, as each branch represents a spelling for
that sound and the length of each branch represents the frequency of that spelling. The words to be
sorted will all contain the sound, but some will have it spelled one way, and some will have it spelled
another way. The students’ task is to sort the words according to the spelling used for the target
sound, and copy the words under the correct headings. During Spelling Tree activities, students will
place “word leaves” on the correct branches of the Spelling Trees.


Foundational Skills 5
**2**


These sorting and copying exercises are powerful mechanisms for teaching spelling. Research has
shown that copying a word by hand is one of the most effective ways—possibly the single most
effective way—to learn to spell the word. The muscle movement involved in writing letters helps
children remember the spelling. The sorting of words into spelling groups is also very helpful, as
it helps students get a sense of which spellings are most common and also which ones are used
in which situations. Most synthetic phonics programs that use these exercises report excellent
performance on standardized spelling assessments.


**Rules and Patterns Related to Spelling Alternatives**


The note at the beginning of each Spelling Alternatives Lesson identifies some spelling patterns
associated with a particular sound or sounds. It might state that a spelling is typically used, for
example, at the beginning or end of a word, in two-syllable words, or after certain sounds. It is
especially important that you as a teacher be aware of this predictable structure of the English
language, though it is certainly not necessary for you to explicitly point out all of these patterns
to students.


In addition, you should be familiar with the following guidelines and resulting spelling alternatives
associated with the formation of plural nouns and root word changes when certain suffixes are
added.


**Formation of Plural Nouns**


In this unit, you will explicitly introduce forming plural endings. Plural endings follow the same
patterns as past-tense endings. The pronunciation varies from word to word in a predictable way,
although most of us are not consciously aware of the pattern.


The ending _–s_ is often used to indicate more than one of something ( _nuts, dogs_ ). However, some
words make plurals with _–es_ ( _dresses, blouses_ ). The ending _–s_ is generally pronounced as voiceless
/s/ when it follows a voiceless sound as in _ships, hats, trucks, cuffs_, and _baths_ . It is generally
pronounced as voiced /z/ when it follows a voiced sound in _dogs, globs, beds, hens, shelves, bars,_
_stings_, and _drums_ . The ending _–es_ is pronounced /ez/ and follows the sounds /sh/, /ch/, /j/, /s/,
/z/, and /x/, as in _dishes, beaches, bridges, prizes, houses_, and _foxes_ . Note that the addition of the
plural marker _–es_ turns a one-syllable word into a two-syllable word.


Irregular plural nouns, such as _children_ and _men_, will not be taught in this unit. The emphasis for Unit 5
is to explicitly teach and help children to recognize the spelling pattern for regular plural nouns.
Students are taught that if a word ends in ‘sh’, ‘ch’, ‘s’, or ‘x’, they will add ‘es’ to make the word plural.


Introduction
**3**


**Root Word Spelling Changes When a Suffix is Added**


Patterns for root words and spelling changes are also explicitly taught. The rule of doubling
consonant spellings is explained and illustrated as a pattern, making it is easier to understand.
You will teach students that if there is a short vowel word that ends in a single consonant, it will
change to a double-letter spelling when a suffix is added. For example, _chip_ changes to _chipping_
and _chipped_, _hug_ turns to _hugging_ and _hugged_, _rub_ turns to _rubbing_ and _rubbed_, and _mop_ turns to
_mopping_ and _mopped_ . Students will also see that there are words that do not follow this pattern due
to the number of ending consonant sounds or type of vowel sound, such as in these examples: _hunt_

    - _hunted_, _cloud_     - _clouded_, or _pinch_     - _pinched_ .


Along with these explicit lessons, students will practice reading these highly patterned English
spellings on a regular basis. Readers are exposed to many of the patterns as they read printed
material and work with printed words. Students will not yet be taught how to add the suffix _–ing_ to
words with the magic ‘e’, such as _page_     - _paging_ .


When reading double-letter spellings for consonant sounds, you will find that most students will
decode and read these words with ease; the challenge that students face occurs when they are
spelling and writing words with suffixes. As students do word sorts and copy words containing the
various spellings, they will hear you say phrases like, “You spell the /p/ in _hopping_ ‘pp’.” As they read
the stories in the Readers and as they process environmental print, students will begin to develop a
better sense of which spellings to use when they are writing.


~~**TRICKY SPELLINGS**~~


As new spellings are introduced, some complexity is added to the reading process. Some of the
spelling units that students have to process are ambiguous in the sense that they can stand for
more than one sound. These ambiguous spellings are called “tricky spellings.” This concept is not
entirely new. You taught the tricky spelling ‘oo’ in Unit 3, and students have also been reading words
with the tricky spelling ‘s’, which can be pronounced /s/ or /z/.


The letter ‘g’ is a spelling that becomes “tricky” in this unit. Up to this point, students have only been
asked to read words where ‘g’ is pronounced /g/. In this unit, students learn ‘g’ as a spelling for the
/j/ sound as in _gem_ and _germ_ . This means that ‘g’ can be pronounced two ways. When students
come across an unfamiliar word with a ‘g’ in it, they may need to “try it both ways” to determine the
correct pronunciation. One way to talk about this is to say that there are two choices when they
see the letter ‘g’. The first and more likely choice is /g/; the second choice, if the first one does not
sound right, or does not make sense in context, is /j/.


Foundational Skills 5
**4**


After we introduce ‘g’ as a spelling for /j/, we include a tricky spelling exercise in which students
are given structured practice pronouncing the tricky spelling both ways to determine the actual
pronunciation of a word. For example, we might ask them to read a sentence like this: _One thing that_
_can make us sick is germs._


Students are asked to “try it both ways”: Is it /g/ /er/ /m/ /z/ or /j/ /er/ /m/ /z/? As they work
to answer that question, students should be encouraged to make use of the surrounding context.
Context clues have been oversold and emphasized too soon in much “whole language” reading
instruction, but here is a case where the student really should use context and their knowledge
of oral language to help determine the pronunciation. The word _sick_ is an important clue that the
pronunciation here is /j/ /er/ /m/ /z/, not /g/ /er/ /m/ /z/. This, however, will only help if the
student has heard the word _germs_ spoken and has a rough sense of what germs are. This is one of
the reasons why this program places so much emphasis on oral language development.


~~**WARM-UPS**~~


In some of the warm-ups for Unit 5, you will ask students to continue practice from Unit 4 in orally
segmenting and blending two-syllable words. For the last two words in these Warm-Ups, you will
write the spellings on the board for students to practice reading.


In another frequent type of warm-up in this unit, you will dictate a variety of consonant sounds that
have more than one possible spelling. Students will write the spellings and thus review and practice
the letter-sound correspondences for consonant sounds.


~~**TRICKY WORDS**~~


In this unit you will introduce the Tricky Words _how, stagecoach_, and _picture_ . The vowel sound in _how_
is tricky because the /ou/ sound is spelled ‘ow’. The word _stagecoach_ is introduced as a Tricky Word
because it is used in one of the stories in the Reader. The tricky part is the vowel sound /oe/ spelled
‘oa’. In the word _picture_, the letters ‘ture’ constitute the tricky part. They are pronounced /cher/.
Please add the words _how, stagecoach,_ and _picture_ to your Tricky Word Wall.


~~**DECODABLE READER: KATE’S BOOK**~~


The Reader for this unit is called _Kate’s Book_ . It follows a Navajo girl named Kate who has various
adventures during her summer vacation and eventually writes a book about them. The premise
is that students are reading the book that Kate wrote, which her grandmother also illustrated.
Note that there is no Big Book for this unit. If you feel that you need to demonstrate the stories to
students, you can do one of the following: (1) Use the images found in the digital version provided in
the online materials for this Reader, or (2) read from the Reader and let students follow along.


Introduction
**5**


You should continue to observe student performance, monitoring as many individual students
or reading groups as possible. Each story is accompanied by a set of discussion questions in the
Teacher Guide. Please discuss these questions with students orally, and encourage them to answer
in complete sentences.


The stories in this Reader are a bit longer, on average, than the stories in the previous Reader.
The amount of text associated with each picture is also increasing. For students who require
focused attention on decoding, have those students read the same story (or stories) repeatedly.
Repeated reading has been shown to improve fluency. In some cases, it might also be useful to read
the stories aloud to these students before they read them on their own. With this differentiated
instruction, you will be able to keep the class working together and give students who are slower at
decoding the kind of practice they need.


~~**STORY QUESTIONS ACTIVITY PAGES**~~


Story Questions Activity Pages are included for each story in the Reader. Some of the activity
pages contain questions; others contain illustrations from the Reader. Students are asked to read
the questions on the activity page and answer in complete sentences. Because students have now
learned one spelling for every sound in English, with the exception of /zh/, they should be able to
produce a phonemically plausible spelling for any word in their oral vocabulary. It therefore makes
sense to begin giving frequent writing assignments.


It is premature to expect or require dictionary-correct spelling. What you can, and should, expect is
that the student will write down a plausible representation of each sound in the word they are trying
to write. You should expect that he or she will write each sound with one of the spellings you have
taught for that sound. Keep in mind, however, that just because students know that some words
have /r/ spelled ‘wr’ does not mean they know that a particular word has that spelling. Students
need to read a lot of words before they can be asked to spell most words correctly. When assessing
student performance, accept all phonetically plausible spellings without correction.


~~**GRAMMAR**~~


Students will learn about and practice changing nouns from singular to plural, as well as the way
some root words change when adding the suffixes _–ing_ and _–ed_ . They will review nouns and verbs,
including the identification and formation of present, past, and future tense, and will also review
adjectives.


Additional grammar topics covered in this unit are sentence types, parts of sentences, and sentence
building. Students will practice identifying and creating statements, questions, and exclamations,
both orally and in writing. They will also practice creating longer sentences.


Foundational Skills 5
**6**


~~**SPELLING**~~


Weekly spelling lists and assessments continue in this unit. The spelling list words continue to be
made up of words with letter-sound correspondences that students have already been introduced to
in reading.


Students will also create a Dictation Journal that focuses on spelling words in isolation as well as
in sentences. Spelling assessments will incorporate a phrase or sentence that students must spell
correctly.


  - For the dictation journal, you can either have students use a journal they use for other writing
activities or you may wish to create a small dictation journal for each student. Stapling five pieces of
paper together is all you will need for each journal. (1)


~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit, we continue formal instruction in the writing process by asking students to write a
letter to Kate, expressing their personal opinion about their favorite parts of her book. Students will
be encouraged to give reasons substantiating why a certain part is their favorite, citing examples
from the text. All writing activities are presented in carefully scaffolded steps, modeled first by
the teacher with the group, followed by additional student practice, with a gradual release of
responsibility so students learn how to plan, draft, and edit pieces of writing.


A note about expectations regarding spelling accuracy during these writing activities is warranted.
Although students will have learned many letter-sound spellings by the end of this unit, there are
still quite a few spelling alternatives that remain to be taught in Grades 1 and 2. Students should
be encouraged to use their existing code knowledge to spell and write the words they want to use.
Plausible, but not dictionary-correct spelling, such as _hunee_ for _honey_ should be accepted at this
point, though spelling can be corrected if written work is being prepared for “publication.”


Writing is one of the most tangible ways that teachers and students can gauge progress. Students
enjoy looking back at their writing from time to time throughout the year to see how much they have
grown as writers. For this reason, you should keep a portfolio of writing samples for each student. In
addition, this portfolio will enable you to quickly review each student’s writing and analyze areas in
need of attention.


Here are some suggestions to create and maintain student portfolios:


  - Allow each student to decorate a plain manilla file folder. Keep the folders in a safe spot. Each time
students write, file their work in their folder.


Introduction
**7**


     - Create a three-ring binder for each student. Then, hole-punch their writing and place in the notebook.


     - If your school has a binder machine, bind a large number of sheets of blank copy paper. Bind a piece
of construction paper to the front and allow students to decorate it.


     - Consult with other teachers in your school to see if there are other ideas that might work well for
your class.


You will be prompted in Lesson 17 to collect specific samples of student opinion writing.


**Left-handed Handwriting Guidance**


•Consider your seating arrangement for left-handed students. The placement of the arms and
elbows in relation to other students can impact their writing space.


•Encourage your students to hold their writing tools correctly to reduce hand strain. Allow time for
students to develop their hand strength in writing.


•Providing pencil grips for students could alleviate the strain on their hands when writing.


•Orienting the paper at an angle can help left-handed students write more easily and comfortably.
Consider using paper with a raised line for students to rest their hands on as they write.


~~**UNIT 5 ASSESSMENT**~~


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


In addition to the weekly spelling assessments, formative assessments are clearly marked for
monitoring individual student performance and progress in the following key skills:


     - oral reading of decodable stories


Observation records for recording student performance in the form of an Anecdotal Reading Record
and Discussion Questions Observation Record are included in Teacher Resources.


     - written response to story comprehension questions


You will be prompted to collect and review activity pages for specific lessons.


      - sound/spellings taught in this unit: /ch/ > ‘tch’, /j/ > ‘g’, /j/ > ‘ge’, /v/ > ‘ve’, /r/ > ‘wr’


Again, you will be prompted to collect specific activity pages.


Quick “Checks for Understanding” to evaluate classroom performance as a whole are also
designated in various lessons.


Foundational Skills 5
**8**


Careful attention to this information, collected on a daily basis, will enable teachers to quickly
determine which students may benefit from reteaching and/or more practice in particular skills,
using the Additional Support activities found at the end of each lesson.


**Student Performance Assessment**


In Lesson 22, you will be prompted to administer a multipart assessment. In the Word Recognition
Assessment, students will be asked to look at several words on the designated activity page and
then circle the written word that matches the spoken word you say. The target words include the
vowel sound/spellings taught in this unit; distractors have been intentionally selected because they
represent frequent sound/spelling confusions. Student performance on this assessment is a good
indicator of whether students have mastered the new sound/spellings.


Students will also be asked to complete a multipart Grammar Assessment, in which they will be
asked to identify the nouns and verbs in a set of sentences; correctly punctuate another set of
sentences with a period, question mark, or exclamation point; and expand sentences by adding
adjectives and greater detail. Finally, they will be tested on their skill in creating the plural form of a
set of nouns, as well as creating the past tense form of verbs using the – _ed_ marker.


~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice Unit 5 skills can be found in the
Pausing Point section included after the last lesson. It is strongly recommended that you pause for
two days and provide targeted remediation for individual or groups of students in any areas in which
they performed poorly on the end-of-unit assessment.


In the Pausing Point, handwriting activity pages are provided. You may want to reproduce the
handwriting pages and use them for morning or seat work.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


In the Teacher Resources section at the end of this Teacher Guide, you will find forms and charts
which may be useful, including the following:


  - Tricky Word Family Letter


  - Tricky Word Flash Cards


  - Tricky Word Assessment Record: Beginning and End of Unit 5 (optional)

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


Today you will review the major spellings for the /p/ sound: the basic
code spelling ‘p’ as in _pot_ and the spelling alternative ‘pp’ as in _napping_ .
The following chart shows how common each spelling is.


Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


  - ‘ **p** ’ is the most common spelling for /p/. It is used in most situations,
including initial and final position, in the initial consonant clusters _pl–_, _pr–_,
_sp–_, and _spl–_ ( _plus_, _price_, _spill_, _splash_ ), in the final consonant clusters _–pt_,
_–pth_, _–lp_, _–mp_, and _–sp_ ( _swept_, _depth_, _gulp_, _swamp_, _lisp_ ), and with separated
digraphs ( _tape_, _stripe_ ).


  - ‘ **pp** ’ is never used in initial position and is not used in many one-syllable
words. It is used mainly in doubling situations of the sort described in the
introduction to this unit ( _drip_   - _dripping_ ) and after a short vowel in other
multisyllable words ( _copper_, _guppy_, _apple_ ).


**Foundational Skills**

  - Prepare to display the Consonant Code Flip Book within view of all students.
You may wish to tab page 1.


**Language**

  - Draw three separate flowers on the board or chart paper, along with the roots
for each, similar to the image in the Root Words activity.


**Universal Access**

  - Gather pictures of words that start with ‘p’ for the Complete the Sentence
activity: _puppy, pig, paper, pink, pancake, pants, popsicle_ .


  - Gather images of the singular and plural nouns listed in the Plural Nouns
activity.

Challenge


After completing several
of the sentences, ask
students to think of a
statement with a missing
word that starts with the
/p/ sound, and have their
classmates identify the
missing word.

**Primary Focus**
Students will recognize spoken alliteration or groups of words that begin with the
same spoken onset or initial sound. ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.ii**~~


Students will recognize the spellings ‘p’ and ‘pp’ for /p/ and decode one-syllable
and multisyllable words with those spellings. ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.i**~~


~~**COMPLETE THE SENTENCES (5 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.ii**~~


  - Tell students that today they are going to review the /p/ sound as in _pig_ .


  - Have students say the /p/ sound several times.


  - Ask students whether /p/ is a vowel sound or a consonant sound. ( _It is a_
_consonant sound, made with the mouth closed and an obstructed airflow._ )


  - Tell students that you are going to say some incomplete sentences, each of
which is missing its last word. Explain that the missing words begin with the
sound /p/.


  - Read the first sentence in the following box, and have students raise their
hands if they think they know the missing word.


  - Have students say the missing word.


  - Work through the remaining sentences in the same manner.





**TEKS 1.2.A.ii** Demonstrate phonological awareness by recognizing spoken alliteration or groups of words that begin with the

~~**SPELLINGS FOR /P/ (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that you will review the spelling alternatives for /p/.





Code Materials




- Turn to **Consonant Code Flip Book page 1** . Point to the ‘p’ and ask students
to name the letter. Read the word _pot_, and remind students that ‘p’ can be
used to spell /p/ in English words.


- Remind students that /p/ is a consonant sound that is written in red on the
Spelling Card because when we say consonant sounds, parts of our mouth
touch or are closed, blocking or “stopping” some of the air.


- Point to the power bar under the ‘p’, and ask students what the bar means.
_(It means that ‘p’ is a very common spelling for /p/.)_


- Write ‘p’ on the board, along with the two sample words listed in the
following box.


- Ask students to tell you another spelling for /p/ that they have learned.


- Repeat the previous steps, reviewing with students the sample word and the
power bar on the Spelling Card.


- Write ‘pp’ on the board, along with the two sample words listed in the
following box.






  - Remind students that ‘p’ is the most common spelling for /p/.

**Primary Focus**
Students will recognize and write common root words, will identify the meaning
of words with the affixes _–ed_ and _–ing_, and will recognize when to double
the consonant when adding inflected endings to one-syllable, short-vowel
words. ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.v; TEKS 1.3.C**~~

Students will spell and write one-syllable words containing r-controlled syllables


~~**TEKS 1.2.C.iii; TEKS 1.2.C.iv**~~


~~**ROOT WORDS (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that in Unit 4 they practiced reading and writing twosyllable words. Some of the two-syllable words they read had a root word
with an ending added to it, such as – _ing_ and – _ed_ . Explain that word endings
are also called suffixes.


  - Direct students’ attention to the first flower you prepared in advance. Point to
the roots of the flower, and explain that the roots stay in the ground and help
to keep the flower in place.


  - Label the roots of the flower with the word _stop_ . Explain that _stop_ is a
root word.


  - Tell students that next to the petals of the flower you will now write the root
word _stop_ with different suffixes.


  - Write _stopping_ by one of the flower petals. Ask students to use the word
_stopping_ in a sentence.


  - Besides the suffix – _ing_, ask students whether they notice any other
difference between the root word and _stopping_ . Point out that the letter ‘p’ at
the end of _stop_ is doubled when the suffix is added.


  - Next write _stopped_ by another flower petal, asking students to use the word
in a sentence. Again ask whether they notice any differences between this
new word and the root word, besides the suffix – _ed_ .


**TEKS 1.2.B** Demonstrate phonological awareness by (v) decoding words with inflectional endings including -ed, -s, and -es;
(i) decoding words in isolation and in context by applying common letter sound correspondences; (ii) decoding words with

- Direct students’ attention to the second flower you prepared in advance.
Repeat the process with the words _tap, tapped, tapping_ .


- Direct students’ attention to the third flower you prepared in advance.
Repeat the process again with the words _mop, mopped, mopping_ .


- Ask if students see a pattern. If they do not see the pattern, underline the
double-letter spellings, and explain that the final consonant letter in each
root word was doubled when a suffix was added.


- Explain that when you add a suffix to a one-syllable root word with a short
vowel sound followed by a single consonant, you double the consonant
before adding the suffix.


- Return to each of the root words to verify that this is the case. For example,
ask students, “How many syllables is the root word _stop_ ?” _(One; you may clap_
_to show it is one syllable.)_


- Ask students, “Does _stop_ have a short vowel sound?” (Circle the ‘o’ and say
the /o/ sound to show it is a short vowel sound.) Ask, “Does _stop_ end in a
single consonant?” _(yes)_


- Tell students that because stop is a one-syllable word with a short vowel
sound and a single consonant ending, the final consonant is doubled when
adding – _ing_ or – _ed_ .


- Verify _tap_ and _mop_ in the same way.


- Have students turn to Activity Page 1.1. Remind students to write the date
beneath their names on the activity page.


- Review first the completed example using the root word _sip_ .


- Read the first word, _sip_, carefully explaining the shift in the spelling across
the suffix columns.


- Have students look at the word _sip_ and tell you how many syllables it has.
Remind students that one-syllable words have one vowel sound.


- Confirm that the word _sip_ has one syllable. Have students look to see if it has
a short vowel in it and if it ends in a single consonant. _(Yes, the ‘i’ in_ sip _is a_
_short vowel. Yes, ‘p’ is a single consonant.)_


- Explain that because _sip_ is a one-syllable word that has a short vowel sound
and ends in a single consonant, an extra ‘p’ is added before adding the
suffixes – _ed_ and – _ing_ to _sip_ . _Sip_ turns to _sipped_ and _sipping_ .


- Point out _sipped_ and _sipping_ in the next column. Ask students to circle the
double consonant spelling, and underline the suffixes – _ed_ and – _ing_ .

 - When you work on the words _stamp_ and _jump_, be sure to point out that even
though each of these words is one syllable with a short vowel, they do not
end in a single consonant. Instead, two consonants—‘mp’—follow the short
vowel sound. The final consonant is, therefore, not doubled.

- Point out that when you counted to two, three, and four, the words changed.
Write each of the words on the board, explaining that, for example, _cat_ became
_cats, dog_ became _dogs_, and _chick_ became _chicks_ . Point out that the letter ‘s’
added to the end of a noun signals that there is more than one of something.


- Explain that these words became plural nouns (i.e., nouns designating more
than one of something) when the letter ‘s’ was added.


- Next explain that you will say a noun and hold up your fingers to indicate how
many there are.


Foundational Skills 5


 - Tell students to say the number and then the plural form of the noun. For example,
say _cat_ and hold up four fingers. Students should say, “four cats.”


 - Then write the word _cats_ on the board underlining the letter ‘s’.


Check for Understanding


Ask students what adding ‘s’ to a noun means. _(the noun is plural)_


 - Repeat with the remaining nouns and numbers.


1. cake 2 _(two cakes)_


2. hat 1 _(one hat)_


3. ship 2 _(two ships)_

syllables cannot stand alone as separate words.


~~**INTRODUCE TRICKY WORD: HOW (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Write the Tricky Word _how_ on the board, and ask students how they would
pronounce it by blending. _(They might say something like /h/ /o/ /w/.)_


**Note:** Alternatively, you can ask students how they would spell the word _how_ .
They will probably come up with the spelling ‘hou’. Explain that in this word the
sound /ou/ is spelled ‘ow’ instead of ‘ou’, just like in the Tricky Word _down_ .


  - Explain that we actually pronounce this word /h/ /ou/ as in, “How old
are you?”


  - Circle the letter ‘h’ and explain that it is pronounced just as one would expect,
as /h/.


  - Underline the letters ‘o’ and ‘w’, and explain that they are the tricky part of the
word. The ‘o’ and ‘w’ stand for the /ou/ sound.


  - Tell students that when reading the word _how_, they have to remember to
pronounce the letters ‘o’ and ‘w’ as /ou/.


  - Tell students that when writing the word _how_, they have to remember to spell
the /ou/ sound with the letters ‘o’ and ‘w’.

- Remind students that in the previous lesson they practiced changing a
singular noun that names just one thing to a plural noun that names more
than one thing.


- Tell students that a noun that names one thing is called a _singular noun_ . Ask
students to provide an example of a singular noun, or a noun that names
just one thing.


- Tell students that they will now practice changing singular nouns to
plural nouns.


- Hold up a pen, and write the word _pen_ on the board. Ask students how many
objects you are holding up. _(one)_


- Hold up two pens, and ask students how many you are holding up now. _(two)_
Ask students how they would say the word to mean “more than one
pen.” _(pens)_


- Ask students how to spell the word _pens_, as you write it on the board and call
attention to the addition of the letter ‘s’. Point out that the ‘s’ in this plural
noun is not pronounced /s/. The ‘s’ in _pens_ has the buzzy sound /z/.

Check for Understanding


Write the word _dish_ on the board. Ask students if this is a singular noun that names

one thing or a plural noun that names more than one thing.

_(singular noun)_


 - Tell students that you want to make the word _dish_ plural. Add ‘s’ to the word.
Have students try to say the word in its plural form with just an ‘s’ at the
end. Ask if it sounds correct to say /d/ /i/ /sh/ /s/. _(no)_ Have them listen
carefully as you say the word correctly: /d/ /i/ /sh/ /e/ /z/.


 - Explain that it is sometimes necessary to add ‘es’ to the end of a word,
instead of just ‘s’, to make it plural. Write the word _dishes_ on the board.
) **Digital Component 2.1**


 - Direct students’ attention to the chart you prepared in advance. Tell students
that if a word ends in ‘sh’, ‘ch’, ‘s’, or ‘x’, they must add ‘es’ to the end of the
word in order to make the plural form of the word. Have them say each of the
sound/spellings in the chart to hear the sounds they make.


 - Say the word _wish_, and ask students under which column this word should be
written. _(‘sh’)_ Have students provide the correct spelling for making _wish_ a
plural noun. Repeat with the following words:
















|‘sh’|‘ch’|‘s’|‘x’|
|---|---|---|---|
|wishes<br>dishes|churches<br>ditches|dresses|boxes<br>foxes|




- Repeat with the word game. When students realize the word does not end in
any of the four spellings in the columns, ask them how to spell the plural form
to mean more than one game. _(add ‘s’ only)_ Ask students why the word only
needs an ‘s’ added to make it plural. _(The word_ game _does not end in one of the_
_sound/spellings in the chart so only ‘s’ needs to be added to make it plural.)_

**Lesson 2: “A Letter from Kate”**

Reading



20M



**Primary Focus:** Students will identify the information that different parts of a book
provide. ~~**TEKS 1.2.D**~~


Students will read “A Letter from Kate” with purpose and understanding; will answer
oral literal, inferential, and evaluative questions about key details in the text; and will
answer written short-answer and multiple-choice questions about the text.


~~**TEKS 1.2.B.i; TEKS 1.6.G; TEKS 1.7.C**~~


~~**INTRODUCE THE READER AND THE STORY (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students they will start a new Reader today. Write the title of the Reader,
_Kate’s Book_, on the board. Ask students, “Who does the book belong to?
How do you know?” _(Kate; the apostrophe)_


  - Tell students that the stories in this Reader are told by a girl named Kate Nez.
Another way to say this is that Kate is the narrator of each chapter of the
book. Explain that _narrator_ is a word that describes who is telling the story.


  - Explain that Kate writes about a summer she spent with her Doba, which
is the Navajo name for a grandmother. The Navajo are a Native American
tribe, or group of people, who originally came from the Southwestern
United States. Today, Navajo people can live all over the United States.
Remind students that they read stories about another grandmother in _Gran_
earlier this year. Like Gran, Doba is active and enjoys spending time with her
grandchildren.


  - Tell students that, in addition to Kate and Doba, they will meet other
characters in the different stories.


**TEKS 1.2.D** Demonstrate print awareness by identifying the information that different parts of a book provide; **TEKS 1.2.B.i**

Foundational Skills 5


 - Distribute the Readers. Remind students that the story is about a Navajo
girl named Kate. Have students look through the pictures and images in
the Reader. Ask students what they notice about the pictures and images.
_(Answers may vary.)_


 - Direct students’ attention to the symbols that decorate some of the pages.
Ask students to describe the symbols. _(Answers may vary, but should include_
_that there are zigzags, colors, and other geometric shapes.)_


 - Explain to students that the images are based on traditional Navajo weaving
designs. _Weaving_ means interlacing yarn or threads together to make a cloth.
The design with the cross shape has a special meaning. In Navajo culture,
the Spider Woman taught the Navajos how to weave, and the cross shape
refers to the Spider Woman as the original teacher of weaving. Other shapes
are inspired by the landscape that the Navajo people call home and include
shapes like mountains, canyons, stars, and storm clouds. Explain to students
that they will hear a story about Spider Woman later in the unit.


 - Look at the list of story titles in the table of contents. Ask students what they
will likely read first, based on the title of the first story. _(a letter from Kate)_


**Preview Spellings**

 - Remind students that in the Reader, two-syllable words are separated by
the • symbol.


 - Please preview the following spellings before reading today’s story.
The special Tricky Word for today’s story is _Doba_, which is pronounced
/d/ /oe/ • /b/ / ə / or doe • buh. Have students practice reading and

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today you will review the major spellings for the /b/ sound: the basic
code spelling ‘b’ as in _bat_, and the spelling alternative ‘bb’ as in _rubbing_ .
The following chart shows how common each spelling is.


Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


  - ‘ **b** ’ is the most common spelling for the /b/ sound; it is used in both initial
and final positions, in the initial consonant clusters _bl–_ and _br–_ ( _blind, brick_ ),
and with separated digraphs ( _tribe_ ).


  - ‘ **bb** ’ follows the same patterns as ‘pp’. It is rare in one-syllable words and is
never used at the beginning of a word. It is used mainly in doubling situations
of the sort described in the introduction to this unit ( _grab > grabbing_ ) and
after a short vowel in other multisyllable words ( _rabbit, hobby, nibble_ ).

 - Remind students that they have also reviewed the /p/ sound.


 - Ask students whether /p/ is a vowel sound or a consonant sound. _(It is a_
_consonant sound, made by closing the lips to obstruct the airflow.)_


 - Remind students that /p/ and /b/ are very similar—they are sister sounds.
The only difference between these sounds is their voicing: /p/ is voiceless,
whereas /b/ makes the voice box vibrate. Tell students that they can feel the
difference by placing two fingers on their voice boxes.


 - Write the number ‘1’ on the board with the / _p_ / beside it. Then write the

  - Read the first word, _nap_, carefully explaining the shift in the spelling across
the suffix columns.


    - “Look at the word _nap_ . How many syllables is it?” Remind students that
one-syllable words have one vowel sound. “ _Nap_ has one syllable. Let’s
look to see if it has a short vowel sound in it. Yes, the ‘a’ in _nap_ is a short
vowel sound. Does _nap_ end in a single consonant sound? Yes, ‘p’ is a single
consonant sound. Because _nap_ is a one-syllable word that has a short vowel
sound and ends in a single consonant sound, we add an extra ‘p’ before
adding the suffix _–ed_ or – _ing_ to _nap. Nap_ turns to _napped_ or _napping_ .”


  - Ask students to circle the double consonant spelling, and underline each
suffix, _–ed_ and – _ing_ .


  - Complete the remaining items as a class, reviewing the pattern as you
go along.


  - When you work on the words _pump_ and _camp_, be sure to point out that even
though each of these words is one syllable with a short vowel sound, they do
not end in a single consonant. Instead, two consonants—‘mp’—follow the
short vowel sound. The final consonant is therefore not doubled.

  - Read the sentences, and have students repeat after you.


  - Tell students that each of these sentences is a particular type of sentence.
Ask students how the two sentences differ. _(One sentence tells us something_
_and the other sentence asks us something.)_


  - Reread the first sentence, and point out that it begins with a capital letter and
ends with a period. Explain that this type of sentence is called a statement
because it tells us something. Tell students that sentences that end with a
period as punctuation are called statements.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


Today you will create and display a new visual prompt to teach and review
spelling alternatives—a “Spelling Tree.” The trunk of a Spelling Tree
represents the specific sound under study, whereas the various branches
and their respective leaves represent the different spellings for this sound.
The Spelling Tree serves as a visual reminder that one sound can have more
than one spelling.


Also, today you will review four important spellings for the /k/ sound: the
basic code spelling ‘c’ as in cat, and the spelling alternatives ‘k’ as in _kid_, ‘cc’
as in _socc•er_, and ‘ck’ as in _black_ . The following chart shows how common
each spelling is.


Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


  - /k/ is one of the trickiest consonant sounds to spell.


  - ‘ **c** ’ is the most common spelling. It is generally used in words that begin with
_ca–_, _co–_, and _cu–_ ( _cat, cot, cut_ ) and in the initial consonant clusters _cr–_,
_scr–_, _sc–_, and _cl–_ ( _crash, scratch, scare, climb_ ).


  - ‘ **c** ’ is also used in final position (mostly in multisyllable words like _clinic_ and
_picnic_ ) and in the final consonant cluster _–ct_ ( _act, elect_ ).


  - ‘ **k** ’ is generally used in words that begin with _ki–_ or _ke–_ ( _kitchen, kettle_ ); it is
also found in the initial consonant cluster _sk–_ ( _skip_ ).


  - ‘ **k** ’ is found at the end of a word or syllable (instead of ‘ck’) when the
preceding vowel sound is “long” ( _steak, Greek_ ) and/or when /k/ is part of a
consonant cluster ( _desk, think_ ).


  - ‘ **k** ’ is the spelling for /k/ used with separated vowel digraphs ( _cake, like_ ).


Lesson 4 Spelling Alternatives: Review /k/ › ‘c’, ‘k’, ‘ck’, and ‘cc’
**49**


  - ‘ **ck** ’ is not used at the beginning of words or syllables; it is generally used
after a “short” vowel sound ( _stack, bucket, tackle, tickle_ ).


  - ‘ **cc** ’ is rare; it is never used at the beginning of a word or syllable, or in onesyllable words ( _soccer, hiccup, raccoon_ ).


 - Words with final /k/ keep the spelling they have in the root form, even when
suffixes are added: _back_   - _backing_ ; _risk_   - _risky_ .


 - The sound /k/ is also heard in the sound combinations /x/ (/k/ + /s/) and
/qu/ (/k/ + /w/).


**Foundational Skills**

) **Digital Component 4.1**


 - Write the following headers on the board/chart paper, or prepare to use the
digital version (Digital Component 4.1): ‘c’, ‘k’, ‘ck’, ‘cc’, _odd ducks_ .


 - Prepare to display the Consonant Code Flip Book within view of all students.
You may wish to tab page 5. Also have student Individual Code Charts and
red markers readily available.


 - Prepare a Spelling Tree for the /k/ sound, using the directions and template
in Teacher Resources. You should have the Spelling Tree assembled and
ready to be displayed before you begin this lesson.


 - Write the following words on leaves to add to the /k/ Spelling Tree, using the
template in Teacher Resources: _car_, _cone_, _class_, _fact_, _cab•in_, _pic•nic_, _att•ic_,
_kite_, _fork_, _skin_, _book_, _back_, _truck_, _brick_, _quack_, _hicc•up_, _socc•er_ .


 - Also have some blank leaves and odd duck cards ready to use in the lesson.


**Reading**

) **Digital Component 4.2**


 - Create the Preview Spellings chart for Introduce the Story on the board/
chart paper, or use the digital version (Digital Component 4.2).


 - Plan small groups for the Reading lesson.


 - Write some of the words or phrases from Additional Support in previous
lessons on the board. If some Group 1 pairs finish early, they can illustrate
one of the words or phrases.


**Universal Access**

 - Gather real objects and/or images of the multiple-meaning word _spot_ and
the words _shimmer_ and _hike_ from the story. Prepare to act out the phrase,
“well, I’ll be” when previewing vocabulary. For the word _expert_, identify reallife experts that your students can relate to.

Students will produce words with the /k/ sound and will sort the words based on
the following sound/spellings: /k/ > ‘c’, ‘k’, ‘ck’, and ‘cc’. ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.i**~~


~~**SOUND RIDDLES (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that today they are going to review the /k/ sound as in _cat_ .


  - Have students say the /k/ sound several times.


  - Ask students whether /k/ is a vowel sound or a consonant sound. _(It is a_
_consonant sound, made with the mouth closed and an obstructed airflow.)_


  - Tell students that you are going to say some riddles, each of which has an
answer that starts with the /k/ sound.


  - Have students raise their hands and wait to be called on if they think they
know the answer.



Support


After one student
answers, have all students
repeat the correct
answer aloud. Stress the
/k/ sound.

Code Materials



) **Digital Component 4.1**


 - Direct students’ attention to the headers you prepared in advance: ‘c’, ‘k’, ‘ck’,
and ‘cc’. Tell students you will sort words according to the spelling of /k/.


 - Ask students to share any words that contain the /k/ sound (not the letter ‘k’,
but the sound /k/).


 - Write and sort the /k/ words that students provide according to spelling on
the chart you prepared in advance. If students provide a word in which the /k/
sound is not spelled with any of the spellings on the chart, list these words in
the “odd ducks” column. Explain that odd ducks are words in which the /k/
sound is written with a spelling that is not taught in Grade 1. Do not list words
in the odd ducks column unless students happen to suggest these words.


 - Circle the letters that stand for the /k/ sound in each word. For example,
if a student says _cat_, list the word under the heading ‘c’ and circle the ‘c’. If
a student says a word that contains two different spellings for /k/, list the
word twice.

 - Turn to **Consonant Code Flip Book page 5** . Review with students the
spellings for /k/, pointing out sample words and discussing the power bars.


~~**SPELLING TREE FOR /K/ (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Direct students’ attention to the prepared Spelling Tree. Tell students that
this Spelling Tree will help them keep track of and organize the different
spellings for the /k/ sound.


 - Point to the trunk labeled /k/, and tell students to say the /k/ sound. Tell
them that you are going to add leaves to the different branches of this Spelling
Tree. All of the words that you put on the Spelling Tree will have the /k/ sound.


 - Point to the branches, and explain that each branch will represent a different
spelling for /k/. Review the spellings on the branches, and note that the
branches are like the power bars because they show how common a spelling
is for a particular sound. The biggest branches show the most common or
most frequent spellings.



**52**


- Point out that the odd ducks branch is the shortest. Explain that words with
unusual spellings are called odd ducks. Odd ducks are Tricky Words, and like
Tricky Words, odd ducks are on yellow paper.


- Show students the following leaves, one at a time, with words that have
the /k/ spellings that you prepared in advance: _kite, back, hicc_  - _up_, and _car_ .
Ask students to read one word at a time. Then ask one student to tell you
on which branch you should place this leaf/word; then tape that leaf to the
Spelling Tree. Continue until all four of the leaves have been read and placed
on the appropriate branch.


- Distribute the remaining leaves to pairs of students, one leaf per pair. Give
students one minute to practice reading the word with their partner and to
discuss the proper placement of their particular leaf on the Spelling Tree.


- Call on each pair of students to show their leaf to their classmates. Have
them read the word and then direct you where to tape the leaf. Ask for
confirmation from the remainder of the class. Continue until all of the words
are placed on the Spelling Tree.


- Explain that you will be using the Spelling Tree as an organizer. Students will
have a chance to add more words to the Spelling Tree in later lessons.



**Lesson 4: “In the Cave”**

Reading



25M



**Primary Focus:** Students will read “In the Cave” with purpose and understanding,
will answer written multiple-choice and short-answer questions about the text, and
will answer oral literal, inferential, and evaluative questions about key details in the
text. ~~**TEKS 1.4; TEKS 1.6.G; TEKS 1.7.C; TEKS 1.8.D**~~


~~**INTRODUCE THE STORY (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that the setting, or where the story takes place, is a cave.
Ask students, “Where do you find caves? What is a cave like?” _(Caves are_
_generally located in the side of a mountain, underground. Some occur_
_naturally, such as in a mountain, whereas others are spaces dug out by people._
_Caves are often dark and cool.)_


**TEKS 1.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text; **TEKS 1.6.G** Evaluate details to

**TEKS 1.8.D** Describe the setting.



Challenge


Have students generate
additional words with the
/k/ sound to add to the
Spelling Tree. Write these
on leaves, and then ask
students to place them
on the correct branches.
If students come up with
any odd ducks, such
as the words _ache_ or
_stomach_, they can be
written on the yellow,
duck-shaped cards.

 - Tell students that caves can provide shelter, meaning they are a place that
provides cover. Doba and Kate are out on a hike when it starts to rain, so
they go into a cave for shelter.


**Preview Spellings**

 - Please preview the following spellings and Tricky Words before reading
today’s story. Point out to students that _something_ is a compound word,
made up of _some_ and _thing_ .


 - The special Tricky Word for today’s story is _Sani_, which is pronounced
/s/ /o/ • /n/ /i/ or sah • neh. In Navajo, the ‘ni’ sound would be a breathy
sound like letter ‘i’ in the word _is_ . The second syllable takes the emphasis.
Have students practice reading and saying _Sani_ several times before reading.
The word may be difficult for some students to pronounce.

Spelling Tree. All of the words that you put on the Spelling Tree will have the
/k/ sound.


- Remind students that each branch represents a different spelling for /k/.
Review the spellings on the branches, and note that the branches are like the
power bars because they show how common a spelling is for a sound. The
biggest branches show the most common or most frequent spellings.


- Remind students that the odd ducks branch is the shortest. Odd ducks are
Tricky Words, and like Tricky Words, odd ducks are on yellow paper.


- Show students the following leaves, one at a time, with words that have the
/k/ spellings that you prepared in advance: _class_  - _room, back_  - _pack, car_  - _pet,_
_cave, black, crash, kids, bark_  - _ing, kicked, corn_  - _flake_ . ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.ii; TEKS 1.2.B.iii**~~


- Ask students to read one word at a time. Then ask one student to tell you on
which branch you should place this leaf/word; then tape it to the Spelling
Tree. Continue until all of the leaves have been read and placed on the
appropriate branch.


- If time permits, ask several students if they can think of any other words with
the /k/ sound. Write each word on a leaf, and then ask the student to place it
on the correct branch. If students came up with any odd ducks, they can be
copied onto the yellow, duck-shaped cards.

 - Write _dip_ on the board. Ask students if _dip_ is a one-syllable word. _(yes)_
Say the /i/ sound in _dip_, and ask students if /i/ is a short vowel sound.
_(yes)_ Point to the ‘p’, and ask students if the short vowel sound has a single
consonant ending. _(yes)_


 - Ask students how they would spell the past-tense form of _dip_, knowing that
_dip_ is a one-syllable word with a short vowel sound and a single consonant
ending. _(dipped)_


 - Write _shout_ on the board. Ask students if _shout_ is a one-syllable word. _(yes)_ Say
the /ou/ sound in _shout_, and ask students if /ou/ is a short vowel sound. _(no)_


 - Ask students, “Because _shout_ is a one-syllable word that does not have a
short vowel sound, how would I spell the past-tense form?” _(shouted)_


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 5.2.


 - As a class, work through filling out the chart. First read the words aloud, and
then ask students to use them in a sentence. Then work on changing each
root word by adding – _ed_ and – _ing_ .


 - When you come to a word that does not change to a double-letter spelling,
ask students why it is different. Guide students in seeing that words that
do not change to a double-letter spelling are ones that have more than one
consonant after the short vowel sound or do not have a short vowel sound.

Lesson 6 Spelling Alternatives: Introduce /ch/ › ‘ch’ and ‘tch’
**67**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


Today you will introduce an important spelling alternative for the /ch/ sound.
Students should already know the basic code spelling ‘ch’ as in _chin_ . In this
lesson you will review that spelling and introduce the spelling alternative ‘tch’
as in _itch_ . The following chart shows how common each spelling is.



Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


  - ‘ **tch** ’ is almost never used at the beginning of a word or syllable; it is
usually found after one of the “short” vowel sounds ( _batch, itch, etch,_
_botch, Dutch_ ).


  - ‘ **ch** ’ is used in most other situations, including at the beginning of a word
( _chop, chain_ ), in the final position after sounds other than the “short vowels”
( _beach, march, ouch, smooch_ ), and in consonant clusters ( _lunch, pinch_ ).


**Foundational Skills**

 - Prepare to display the Consonant Code Flip Book within view of all students.
You may wish to tab page 7. Also have the Spelling Card listed in the Lesson at a
Glance chart, student Individual Code Charts, and red markers readily available.


**Reading**

) **Digital Component 6.1**


 - Create the Preview Spellings chart for Introduce the Story on the board/
chart paper, or use the digital version (Digital Component 6.1).


 - Plan small groups for the Reading lesson.


 - Write some of the words or phrases from Additional Support in previous
lessons on the board. If some Group 2 pairs finish early, they can illustrate
one of the words or phrases.

**Universal Access**

 - Gather images of the words _chips, chicken, match, chew,_ and _catch_ to use
during the Sound Riddles activity.

  - Write ‘ch’ on the board, along with the two sample words: _chin, much_ .


  - Tell students that, as they can see on the power bar, ‘ch’ is the most common
spelling for this sound, but it is not the only one.


  - Tell students that you are going to show them how to write another spelling
for the consonant sound /ch/.


  - Write ‘tch’ on the board and explain that the three letters work together to
stand for the /ch/ sound.


  - Model drawing the spelling two or three more times.


  - Turn to **Consonant Code Flip Book page 7**, and put the Spelling Card
‘tch’ > /ch/ ( _itch_ ) on the appropriate space. Have students read the sample
word. Discuss the power bar. Explain that the short power bar means that the
/ch/ sound is sometimes spelled this way.


  - Have students outline the ‘tch’ spelling on **Individual Code Chart page 6** in
red marker to show that it is a spelling they have learned for a
consonant sound. ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.ii**~~

saying the sound.


  - Tell students that whenever the spelling ‘tch’ appears on an activity page or
in a story for the next few lessons, it will be printed in darker, bolder ink to
remind them that the three letters stand for a single sound.

**Chaining**

  - Tell students that they will be working on chains of words with /ch/.


  - Write the first word and tell students to look at the letters from left to right.
As they look at the letters, they need to remember the sounds the letters
stand for and blend the sounds together to make the word.


  - Make the letter change needed for the next word and describe the change as it is
made. For example, when changing _hitch_ to _ditch_, say, “Now I’m changing the /h/
sound at the beginning of the word to the /d/ sound. What word did I make now?”.


  - If support is needed, model the sounds and blending. Also encourage
students to use the blending motions they have learned.


  - To provide students with practice spelling entire sentences, dictate a
sentence using one of the words from one of the charts above. Have students
write the entire sentence in their Dictation Journal.


**Code Knowledge**


Before today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average

Lesson 7 Spelling Alternatives: Review /g/ › ‘g’ and ‘gg’
**79**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


For oral segmenting and blending activities, continue to review the different
types of two-syllable words students learned in Unit 4: compound words,
root words with suffixes, and other types of two-syllable words in which the
individual syllables cannot stand alone as separate words.


In the segmenting and blending exercise, the last two words have been
marked with an *. For these words, ask students to segment each syllable
and tell you how to spell the word, syllable by syllable, so you can write the
word on the board.


Also, today you will review two important spellings for the /g/ sound: the
basic code spelling ‘g’ as in _got_, and the spelling alternative ‘gg’ as in _egg_ .
The following chart shows how common each spelling is.


Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


 - ‘ **g** ’ is the most common spelling. It is used in most situations, including initial
position ( _get, gift_ ), final position ( _bug, bag_ ), and in the initial consonant
clusters _gl–_ and _gr–_ ( _glow, grow_ ).


 - ‘ **gg** ’ follows the same patterns as ‘pp’ and ‘bb’. It is never used at the
beginning of a word. It is used in doubling situations ( _big_  - _bigger_ ) and after
a “short” vowel sound in other multisyllable words ( _dagger, snuggle, giggle_ ).


 - The sound /g/ (combined with the sound /z/) can also be represented by the
letter ‘x’ in some words ( _exact, exaggerate_ ).



**80**


**Foundational Skills**

  - Look at each word in the box in Segmenting and Blending Two-Syllable Words
and notice where they are marked with a syllable divider.


  - Prepare to display the Consonant Code Flip Book within view of all students.
You may wish to tab page 6.

vowel sound; clap the number of syllables, if necessary.


  - Point out that this two-syllable word is a compound word (i.e., a word made
up of two separate, single-syllable words). In this case, _rain_ and _bow_ are two
separate words that make up the word _rainbow_ .


  - Repeat the word _rainbow_, pausing slightly between the syllables.


  - Say the first syllable in a segmented fashion, marking each sound with a
finger tap, beginning with a thumb-forefinger tap (/r/ /ae/ /n/).

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


Today you will introduce two spelling alternatives for the /j/ sound. Students
should already know the basic code spelling ‘j’ as in _jump_ . In this lesson, you
will review that spelling and introduce the spelling alternatives ‘g’ as in _gem_
and ‘ge’ as in _fringe_ . The following chart shows how common each spelling is.


Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


  - The ‘ **g** ’ and ‘ **j** ’ spellings are used at the beginning of words and syllables,
but generally not at the end.


  - ‘ **j** ’ is more common than ‘g’ at the beginning of words and syllables.


  - As an initial spelling, ‘ **g** ’ is used mainly in words that begin with _ge–_, _gi–_,
and _gy–_ ( _gem, ginger, gypsy_ ).


  - ‘ **g** ’ (never ‘j’) is used with separated vowel digraphs ( _age, huge_ ).


  - ‘ **g** ’ is used in place of ‘ge’ when suffixes are added (e.g., _barge_   - _barging_
and _large_   - _largest_ ).


  - ‘ **ge** ’ is used at the end of words, after r-controlled vowel sounds ( _large, urge_ )
and in consonant clusters ( _plunge, bulge_ ).


  - The spelling alternatives ‘ **dge** ’ as in _judge_ and ‘ **dg** ’ as in _judging_ will be taught
in later grades.


Also, today you will create a new Spelling Tree to teach and review spelling
alternatives for /j/. Remember that the trunk of a Spelling Tree represents
the specific sound under study, whereas the various branches and their
respective leaves represent the different spellings for this sound. The
Spelling Tree serves as a visual reminder that one sound can have more
than one spelling.


Lesson 8 Spelling Alternatives: Introduce /j/ › ‘j’, ‘g’, and ‘ge’
**91**


Refer to the directions and template in Teacher Resources for further
guidance in creating the new Spelling Tree. Remember to mark the trunk of
this Spelling Tree /j/. The Spelling Tree should have four branches that fork
off from the central trunk. Two of the branches for the /j/ Tree are for ‘j’ and
‘g’, which should both be about the same size as they represent the most
frequent spellings. The next, smaller branch should be labeled ‘ge’, whereas
the top branch (and shortest) is for odd ducks.


**Foundational Skills**

 - Be sure students have their Tricky Word cards readily available.


 - Prepare to display the Consonant Code Flip Book within view of all students.
You may wish to tab page 8. Also have the Spelling Cards listed in the Lesson
at a Glance chart, student Individual Code Charts, and red markers readily
available.


) **Digital Component 8.1**


 - Write the following headers on the board/chart paper, or prepare to use the
digital version (Digital Component 8.1): ‘j’, ‘g’, ‘ge’, _odd ducks_ .


 - Prepare a Spelling Tree for the /j/ sound, using the directions and template in
Teacher Resources. You should have the Spelling Tree assembled and ready
to be displayed before you begin this lesson.


 - Write the following words on leaves to add to the /j/ Spelling Tree, using the
template in Teacher Resources: _jump, jar, join, jack•et, germs, gem, gin•ger,_
_mag•ic, in•gest, large, charge, hinge_ .


 - Also have some blank leaves and odd duck cards ready to use in the lesson.

Spanish speakers may
have difficulty pronouncing
the /j/ sound. Explain
that in English, the letter
‘j’ and ‘g’ can stand for the
/j/ sound. Explain that to
make the sound, put the
tip of your tongue against
the top of your mouth and
push your tongue forward,
creating a little explosion of
air. Keep your teeth slightly
open; this will let you make
a different sound than the
/ch/ sound where you keep
your teeth closed before
pushing air out. Have
students practice.

- Read the word _jump_, and remind students that ‘j’ can be used to spell /j/ in
English words.


- Point to the power bar under the ‘j’, and ask students what the length of the
power bar means. ( _It means that ‘j’ is a very common spelling for /j/_ .)


- Write ‘j’ on the board, along with the two sample words: _jump, jar_ .


- Tell students that, as they can see, ‘j’ is not the only spelling for /j/.


- Tell students that /j/ is a tricky sound, which means it is a sound that can be
spelled several different ways.


- Write ‘g’ on the board, and explain that this letter can stand for the /j/ sound.


- On **Consonant Code Flip Book page 8**, put the Spelling Card ‘g’ > /j/ ( _gem_ )
on the appropriate space. Have students read the sample word. Discuss the
length of the power bar. Explain that the /j/ sound is spelled ‘g’ a bit more
often than it is spelled ‘j’.


- Have students outline the ‘g’ spelling on **Individual Code Chart page 6** in
red marker to show that it is a spelling they have learned for a
consonant sound.


- Have students trace the spelling on their desks with a pointed finger while
saying the sound.


- Tell students there is another way to write the /j/ sound.


- Write ‘ge’ on the board, and explain that the two letters work together to
stand for the /j/ sound.


- On **Consonant Code Flip Book page 8**, put the Spelling Card ‘ge’ > /j/
( _fringe_ ) on the appropriate space. Have students read the sample word.
Discuss the length of the power bar. Explain that the shorter power bar
means that the /j/ sound is not usually spelled this way.


- Have students outline the ‘ge’ spelling on **Individual Code Chart page 6** in
red marker to show that it is a spelling they have learned for a
consonant sound.


- Tell students that they can refer to their Individual Code Chart whenever they
are having trouble remembering spelling alternatives for the /j/ sound.


- Tell students that whenever the spelling ‘g’ or ‘ge’ for the /j/ sound appears
on an activity page or in a story for the next few lessons, it will be printed in
darker, bolder ink to remind them that they stand for /j/.

  - Direct students’ attention to the chart with spellings for /j/ you prepared in
advance and note the three spellings for /j/ > ‘j’, ‘g’, and ‘ge’.


  - Ask students to share any words that include the /j/ sound.


  - Write and sort the /j/ words that students provide, according to the spelling,
on the chart. If students provide a word in which the /j/ sound is not spelled
with any of the spellings below, list these words under “odd ducks.” Explain
that odd ducks are words in which the /j/ sound is written with a spelling that
is not taught in Grade 1. Do not list words in the “odd ducks” column unless
students happen to suggest these words.


  - Circle the letters that stand for the /j/ sound in each word. For example, if a
student says _jar_, list the word under the heading ‘j’ and circle the ‘j’. If a student
says a word that contains two different spellings for /j/, list the word twice.


~~**SPELLING TREE FOR /J/ (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Direct students’ attention to the prepared Spelling Tree. Tell students that this
Spelling Tree will help them keep track of and organize the different spellings for
the /j/ sound.


  - Point to the trunk labeled /j/, and tell students to say the /j/ sound. Tell them
that you are going to add leaves to the different branches of this Spelling Tree.
All of the words that you put on the Spelling Tree will have the /j/ sound.


  - Point to the branches, and explain that each branch will represent a different
spelling for /j/. Review the spellings on the branches, and note that the
branches are like the power bars because they show how common a spelling
is for a particular sound. The biggest branches show the most common or
most frequent spellings.


  - Point out that the odd ducks branch is the shortest. Explain that words with
unusual spellings are called odd ducks. Odd ducks are Tricky Words, and like
Tricky Words, odd ducks are on yellow paper.


  - Show students the following leaves, one at a time, with words that have
the /j/ spellings that you prepared in advance _: jump, germs_, and _charge_ .
Ask students to read one word at a time. Then ask one student to tell you
on which branch you should place this leaf/word; then tape that leaf to the
Spelling Tree. Continue until all three of the leaves have been read and placed
on the appropriate branch.

- Distribute the remaining leaves to pairs of students, one leaf per pair. Give
students one minute to practice reading the word with their partner and to
discuss the proper placement of their particular leaves on the Spelling Tree.


- Call on each pair of students to show their leaf to their classmates. Have
them read the word and then direct you where to tape the leaf. Ask for
confirmation from the remainder of the class. Continue until all of the
words are placed on the Spelling Tree.

Lesson 9 Tricky Spelling: Introduce ‘g’ › /g/ and /j/
**103**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


Today students will work on decoding the tricky spelling ‘g’. This spelling
poses a problem for readers because it can be pronounced /g/ (sometimes
called hard ‘g’) or /j/ (sometimes called soft ‘g’). The following chart shows
that /g/ is the more common pronunciation. If students come across
an unfamiliar printed word containing the letter ‘g’, they should first try
pronouncing the ‘g’ as /g/. If that does not sound like a word, or if the
resulting word does not make sense in context, students should try /j/.


Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


 - The spelling ‘ **g** ’ is usually (not always) pronounced /g/ except when followed
by the letters ‘e’, ‘i’, and ‘y’. Initial ‘ **g** ’ is almost always pronounced /g/ when it
is part of an initial consonant cluster like _gl_  - or _gr_  - ( _glad, grab_ ) and when it is
at the beginning of a word and followed by the letters ‘a’, ‘o’, or ‘u’ ( _gang, gum,_
_go_ ). There are exceptions to this, like the words _gift, get, give, girl_ .


 - Final ‘ **g** ’ is almost always pronounced /g/ ( _big, rag, beg_ ) unless it is part of
the ‘ng’ spelling for /ng/ ( _song, king_ ).


You have already taught a lesson introducing a tricky spelling in Unit 3, for
the tricky spelling ‘oo’.


In addition, the Tricky Spelling Practice activity is a good exercise in which
to use “think aloud” strategies, where you describe your thought processes
out loud for the benefit of students. It is also a good exercise in which to
emphasize the use of context clues as a support for decoding skills.

If students point out that
it looks as if the words
_gem_ and _germ_ contain
the spelling ‘ge’, explain
that the ‘e’ represents the
vowel sound /e/ in _gem_
and is part of the vowel
sound /er/ in _germ_ . You
can tell them that ‘g’ is
often pronounced /j/when
it is followed by the letter
/e/, but do not teach this

- On the left side of the board/chart paper, begin by writing /g/. Below it write
the words _gum_, _glad_, and _dog_ . Read the words aloud.


- Point out that the spelling ‘g’ is pronounced /g/ in these words.


- Write the /j/ on the right side of the board/chart paper. Explain that ‘g’ can
sometimes be pronounced /j/ when it is followed by the letter ‘e’ or the
letter ‘i’.


- Below /j/, write the words _gem_ and _germ_ . Read the words aloud, and point
out that the spelling ‘g’ is pronounced /j/ in these words.


- Write the letter ‘g’ on the board between the two sets of words, and circle
the spelling.


- Tell students that in order to figure out how to pronounce this tricky spelling,
students may need to try it two different ways.


- Draw one arrow from ‘g’ to the /g/ words, and label it _1_ . Draw a second arrow
from ‘g’ to the /j/ words, and label it _2_ .


- Explain that /g/ is the most likely pronunciation option and therefore the one
they should try first.


- If that does not sound right, or does not make sense in context, they should
try option 2, /j/.


 - Leave the diagram on the board/chart paper so students can consult it as
they work on the next exercise.


~~**TRICKY SPELLING PRACTICE (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 9.1.


 - Read the example words on the left: _gum, glad, dog_ . Point out the /g/ sound
in these words. Have students underline the ‘g’ in the words.


 - Read the example words on the right: _gem, germ_ . Review that the ‘g’
represents the /j/ sound in these words. Have students underline the ‘g’
in the words.


 - Have students find the underlined ‘g’ in the word in the first sentence.


 - Read the first sentence on the activity page, pronouncing the tricky spelling
‘g’ as /g/: “A cat is /l/ /ar/ /g/ /er/ than a rat.” Ask students if that
sounds right.


 - Explain that, because /l/ /ar/ /g/ /er/ sounds wrong, students need to try it
the other way.


 - Read the sentence again, pronouncing the tricky spelling ‘g’ as /j/: “A cat is
/l/ /ar/ /j/ /er/ than a rat.” Ask students if that sounds right.


 - Write _larger_ in the /j/ column to indicate the ‘g’ in _larger_ is pronounced like
/j/ as in _gem_ .


 - Complete the remaining sentences, having students first find the underlined
‘g’ in the words and read them on their own. Then call on students to
read the sentence aloud, try the tricky spelling both ways, choose the
pronunciation that sounds right and/or makes sense, and print the word in

**Note:** If students have trouble understanding Tricky Spellings, draw a circle on
the board and ask students what it might be. Some possible answers include
a circle, a ball, a cookie, the sun, or a wheel. Explain that some letters and
spellings are like this circle; they can stand for more than one thing. Just as
the circle can be a sun or a cookie, the letter ‘g’ can be a picture of /g/ or /j/.
As an extension you could add details to the picture of the circle (e.g., add
some clouds next to the circle and a house down below). In this context it is
clearer that the circle is the sun. In the same way, the surrounding context of a
sentence can help students figure out whether ‘g’ stands for /g/ or /j/.

_patches_ and _tags_ . Rotate around the class and observe students’ responses.



**Lesson 9: “The Offer”**

Reading



25M



**Primary Focus:** Students will read “The Offer” with purpose and understanding,
will answer written multiple-choice and short-answer questions about the text, and
will answer oral literal and evaluative questions about key details in the text.


~~**TEKS 1.4; TEKS 1.7.C**~~


~~**INTRODUCE THE STORY (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that titles give us clues as to what a story is about.
Explain that the title of today’s story is “The Offer.”


  - Ask students, “What is an offer?” Explain that an offer is an invitation or
proposal of something. For example, if a friend says, “Can I offer you some
candy?” they are providing you the choice of taking a piece of candy.
Point out that the word _offer_ can be a noun or verb.


**Preview Spellings**

  - Please preview the following spellings and Tricky Words before reading
today’s story.


  - The special Tricky Word for today’s story is _Gad_, who is Sani’s grandson. It is
pronounced /g/ /u/ /d/ and it means juniper in Navajo. Students may have
difficulty pronouncing the name, so /g/ /a/ /d/ is also acceptable. Have
students practice reading and saying _Gad_ several times before reading.


**TEKS 1.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text; **TEKS 1.7.C** Use text evidence
to support an appropriate response.

~~**MORE HELP WITH TRICKY SPELLING ‘G’**~~


**Race to the Top**

  - Provide each student with a Race to the Top game board ( **Activity Page TR 9.1** ),
**a game piece** (e.g., different-colored cubes, various coins, odd-shaped buttons,
etc.), and word cards ( **Activity Page TR 9.2** ).


  - Place cards in a facedown pile. As cards are drawn, the word is shown to the
opposing player to be read. For correct answers, students move up a rung;
for incorrect answers, students fall down a rung. First one who gets to the
top wins.


~~**MORE HELP WITH ORAL READING**~~


**Silly Voices**

  - Make a copy of **Activity Page TR 9.3**, and cut the picture cards apart.


  - Provide students with the **Kate’s Book Reader**, and select a story they have
already read, such as “The Coin Shop” or “The Offer.”


  - Have students choose or draw a Silly Voices card to determine the voice they
will use for reading aloud.


  - Students read aloud independently, with a partner, or to the teacher.


  - Partner reading options may include:


◦Take turns reading the entire story.


   - Have one student be the leader, reading a line at a time for the partner
to echo.


   - Read chorally, keeping voices together to read the story.



Support


The task of applying a silly
voice requires notable
cognitive effort. Silly
Voices should be used
to motivate students to
revisit text that is already
very familiar from prior
instruction and rereading.
If students are not already
reading the text with high
accuracy, then rereading
without silly voices to first
establish ease with word
recognition is appropriate.

Ask students to name the two different sounds for the ‘g’ spelling. _(/j/ and_
_/g/)_ Remind students that ‘g’ is often pronounced /j/ when it is followed by
the letter ‘e’ or the letter ‘i’.


  - Show students the prepared leaves. Ask students to read the words aloud and
use them in a sentence. Ask students to tape the leaves to the Spelling Trees.

- Set a timer for ten minutes and tell students that whichever team has the
most runs when the timer rings is the winning team. Point out that accuracy
is important, so they have to be careful reading the words. At the same time,
speed is important as well, so they must pay close attention. The more
turns each team member has to read words, the more likely their team is to
score runs.


- Show a card and ask the first person on the team to read it aloud. If the word
is read correctly, draw a line from home plate to first base, signifying a “hit.”
This player then goes to the back of the team’s line, while the next player
comes forward to read the next card. If the word is correctly read, draw a
line from first to second base. Play continues this way. If the fourth player
reads the word correctly, draw a line from third base to home plate, and mark
“1 run” for the team. Play continues for the team so long as no words are
misread; when a word is misread, the next team takes its turn at bat.

Lesson 11 Spelling Alternatives: Review /t/ › ‘t’, ‘tt’, and ‘ed’
**125**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note to Teacher**


Today you will review all three of the important spellings for the /t/ sound:
the basic code spelling ‘t’ as in _top_, and the spelling alternatives ‘tt’ as in
_sitting_ and ‘ed’ as in _asked_ . The following chart shows how common each
spelling is.


Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


 - ‘ **t** ’ is the most common spelling. It is used at the beginning, middle, and
end of words ( _top, blister, art_ ), in the initial clusters _tr–_, _tw–_, _st–_ ( _train, twin,_
_stain_ ), in the final clusters _–st_, _–lt_, _–pt_, _–ct_, _–nt_, _–ft_ ( _bust, bolt, crept, fact,_
_hunt, lift_ ), and with separated digraphs ( _cute, note, bite, late_ ).


 - ‘ **tt** ’ is used in the same situations as ‘bb’ and ‘pp’. It is never used at the
beginning of a word or syllable. It is rare in one-syllable words ( _mutt_ ). It is
used mostly in doubling situations ( _hot_  - _hotter_ ) and after a “short” vowel
sound in other multisyllable words ( _attic, better, lettuce_ ).


 - ‘ **ed** ’ pronounced /t/ is a past-tense marker used after the voiceless sounds
/f/, /s/, /p/, /k/, /ch/, and /sh/ ( _dressed, hiked_ ). Once the mouth is making
a voiceless sound at the beginning of a consonant cluster, it becomes difficult
to change to a voiced sound at the end. So the whole cluster tends to “go
voiceless.” If English spelling were 100 percent phonetic, we would write
_drest_ instead of _dressed_ . In words that contain separated digraphs, such as
_hiked_ and _baked_, the ‘e’ in the past-tense ending – _ed_ can be seen as serving
two functions. It is part of the separated digraph, and it is part of the pasttense marker.

**Primary Focus**
Students will isolate the /t/ sound at the beginning and end of oral
words. ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.ii; TEKS 1.2.A.vii**~~


Students will read and write words with /t/ > ‘ed’, ‘t’, and ‘tt’. ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.i**~~


Students will sort words by the spelling of /t/, and will double final consonants as
needed when adding affixes to root words. ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.v; TEKS 1.3.C**~~


~~**TONGUE TWISTER FOR /T/ (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that today they are going to review the /t/ sound as in _top_ .


  - Have students say /t/ several times.


  - Ask students if /t/ is a vowel sound or a consonant sound. ( _It is a consonant_
_sound, made with the tongue touching the roof of the mouth just behind the_
_teeth to obstruct airflow._ )


  - Have students close their eyes and listen as you read the following tongue
twister: _Tim told Tina not to twist and turn._


  - Ask students which sound they heard most often. ( _/t/_ )


**TEKS 1.2.A** Demonstrate phonological awareness by (ii) recognizing spoken alliteration or groups of words that begin with
the same spoken onset or initial sound; (vii) segmenting spoken one-syllable words of three to five phonemes into individual
phonemes, including words with initial and/or final consonant blends; **TEKS 1.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge
by (i) decoding words in isolation and in context by applying common letter sound correspondences; (v) decoding words with
inflectional endings including -ed, -s, and -es; **TEKS 1.3.C** Identify the meaning of words with the affixes -s, -ed, and -ing.


Lesson 11 Spelling Alternatives: Review /t/ › ‘t’, ‘tt’, and ‘ed’
**127**


 - Once the /t/ sound has been identified, read the tongue twister a second
time, having students raise their hands whenever they hear the /t/ sound.


 - Break the tongue twister into small chunks and read it again, having students
repeat each chunk back to you: _Tim told Tina (pause) not to twist and turn._


~~**REVIEW SPELLINGS FOR /T/ (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that you will now review the spellings for the /t/ sound.



Code Materials


Activity Page 11.1




 - Turn to **Consonant Code Flip Book page 3** .


 - Review with students the spellings ‘t’ and ‘tt’ by reading the sample words
and discussing the lengths of the power bars.


 - Write the sample words on the board for ‘t’ and ‘tt’ listed in the following box.


 - Show students the Spelling Card for ‘ed’ > /t/ ( _asked_ ). Remind students that
the spelling ‘ed’ is only used for the past-tense marker in verbs.


 - Read the sample word, _asked_, and discuss the power bar. Attach the Spelling
Card to the Consonant Code Flip Book.


 - Write the sample words for ‘ed’ on the board. You may also ask students to
provide words with this sound.


1. t: _truck_, _sit_


2. tt: _kitten_, _bitter_


3. ed: _parked_, _baked_


~~**WORD SORT (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 11.1.


 - Explain that the words in the box contain the sound /t/ spelled ‘t’, ‘tt’, or ‘ed’.


 - Read the words as a class. Ask students to use them in a sentence.





**128**


  - As a class, underline the target spellings ‘t’, ‘tt’, and ‘ed’ in the words in the
box. Then have students sort the words according to these spellings, placing
each word in the appropriate column.


  - When students have finished sorting the words, ask them if they see any
patterns. Here are some things they might notice:


    - ‘t’ is the most common spelling


    - some words change from ‘t’ to ‘tt’ when suffixes are added (e.g., _sit_    _sitting_ and _cut_     - _cutting_ )


    - the ending – _ed_ is used at the end of words to mark past tense.


  - Have students look at the back of the activity page.


  - Explain that the chart lists words with common spelling patterns for the
/t/ sound.


  - Remind students that the words in the first column are called _root words_ .
These are words to which endings can be added.


  - Remind students that they encountered the suffixes – _er_ and – _est_ when
they read “The Green Fern Zoo.” Explain that the ending – _er_ shows _more_ of
something, and – _est_ shows _most_ .


  - Discuss the example words provided— _wet, wetter, wettest_ —and use them in
sentences to illustrate their meanings.


  - Ask students what change was made to the root word _wet_ when the suffixes
were added. Remind them of the pattern that when a suffix is added to a onesyllable word with a short vowel sound followed by a single consonant, the
final consonant spelling is doubled.


  - Tell students that they will add the suffixes – _er_ and – _est_ to the remaining
words in the chart. Tell them to be careful to only double the consonant when
it is needed.


  - Ask students to fill in the empty boxes in the chart. Review the activity page
as a class.

~~**STATEMENTS, QUESTIONS, AND EXCLAMATIONS (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that they have learned about two types of sentences:
questions and statements.


  - Remind them that a statement is a sentence that tells you something, and a
question is a sentence that asks something.


  - Direct students’ attention to the two sentences you prepared in advance.

1. I like to run.


2. Do you like to run?


  - Read the sentences, and have students repeat after you.


  - Reread the first sentence, and point out that it begins with a capital letter and
ends with a period.


  - Reread the second sentence, reading with expression so your voice is higher
at the end of the sentence. Point out that the sentence begins with a capital
letter and ends with a question mark. Explain that this type of sentence is a
question because it asks us something. Sentences that are questions end
with a question mark as punctuation.

  - Ask students to provide examples of statements and questions.


  - Tell students that they will now learn about another type of sentence. Say the
following sentence aloud with an excited expression: “I love to run!”


  - Tell students that sentences with strong emotions, such as excitement,
frustration, joy, or fear, end with exclamation points. A sentence with an
exclamation point is often read in a louder tone than other types of sentences.


  - Write an exclamation point on the board. Tell students that they have already
seen this punctuation in the Reader. Now they can use the exclamation point
when writing sentences to show strong emotions.


  - Read the following sentences aloud, and ask students to decide if a sentence
is a statement, question, or exclamation, and if it should end with a period,
question mark, or exclamation point.


**Note:** These sentences are not entirely decodable and are meant to be used
orally in this exercise.


1. I will go to the store today. ( _statement, ends with a period_ )


2. Watch out! ( _exclamation, ends with an exclamation point_ )


3. Can I eat this cake? ( _question, ends with a question mark_ )


4. Have you ever been to Spain? ( _question, ends with a question mark_ )


5. I loved that movie! ( _exclamation, ends with an exclamation point_ )


6. We can go outside to play. ( _statement, ends with a period_ )


7. It’s snowing! ( _exclamation, ends with an exclamation point_ )


) **Digital Component 11.2**


  - Direct students’ attention to the other sentences you prepared in advance.
Note that the end punctuation is missing from each.


  - Read each sentence as a class. Ask students whether each sentence is a
statement, a question, or an exclamation, and whether it should end with a
period, a question mark, or an exclamation point.


  - Add the appropriate punctuation to each sentence on the board. Point out
that every sentence, no matter whether it is a statement, a question, or an
exclamation, always begins with a capital letter.

Note to Teacher


Today you will review all three of the important spellings for the /d/ sound:
the basic code spelling ‘d’ as in _dot_, and the spelling alternatives ‘dd’ as
in _add_ and ‘ed’ as in _filled_ . The following chart shows how common each
spelling is.


Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


  - ‘ **d** ’ is the most common spelling; it is used in most cases, including initial
position ( _dog_ ), final position ( _mad_ ), in the initial consonant clusters _dr_   - and
_dw_  - ( _drip, dwarf_ ), in the final consonant clusters – _dth_, – _ld_, and – _nd_ ( _width,_
_old, and_ ), and with separated digraphs ( _made_ ).


  - ‘ **dd** ’ is used in the same situations as ‘tt’, ‘bb’, and ‘pp’. It is rare in one-syllable
words and never occurs at the beginning of a word or syllable. It is used
mostly in doubling situations ( _sad > sadder_ ) and after a short vowel in other
multisyllable words ( _ladder, shudder, huddle_ ).


  - ‘ **ed** ’ is only used to spell the past-tense marker. It is pronounced /d/ after
voiced consonants and vowel sounds. In words that contain separated
digraphs, such as _timed_ and _zoned_, the ‘e’ in the past-tense ending _–ed_
can be seen as serving two functions. It is part of the separated digraph,
and it is part of the past-tense marker.

_behind the teeth to obstruct airflow._ )


 - Remind students that /t/ and /d/ are very similar—they are sister sounds.
The only difference between these sounds is their voicing: /t/ is voiceless,
and /d/ makes the voice box vibrate.


 - Write /d/ on the board and the number _1_ beside it. Then write /t/ on the

 - Practice this several times.


 - Next, tell students that you will be reading some words that begin with /t/
or /d/. They should raise one finger when they hear the /d/ sound, and two
fingers when they hear the /t/ sound.

 - Explain that the words in the box contain the sound /d/ spelled ‘d’, ‘dd’, or ‘ed’.


 - Read the words aloud. Have students use them in a sentence.


 - As a class, underline the target spellings ‘d’, ‘dd’, and ‘ed’ in the words in
the box.


 - Have students sort the words according to these spellings, placing each word
in the appropriate column.


 - When students have finished sorting the words, ask them if they see any
patterns. Here are some patterns they may have noticed:


   - ‘d’ is the most common spelling


   - ‘ed’ is used for past-tense verbs


   - some words change from ‘d’ to ‘dd’ when suffixes are added
(e.g., _shred_    - _shredded_ )


 - Have students look at the back of the activity page.


 - Explain that the chart lists words with common spelling patterns for the
/d/ sound.


 - Remind students that the words in the first column are called root words.
These are words to which endings can be added.


 - Also remind them that the endings _–er_ and _–est_ are added to root words to
indicate _more_ of the root word ( _–er_ ) and the _most_ of the root word ( _–est_ ).


 - Have students read the words in the first line of the chart, _mad_, _madder_, and
_maddest_, and use each word in a sentence.


 - Explain that the ‘d’ spelling is replaced in these words by ‘dd’ because a onesyllable word with a short vowel sound that is followed by a single consonant,
changes to a double-letter spelling when a suffix is added.


 - Ask students to fill in the empty boxes in the chart, being careful to double
the ending consonant only when it is necessary.

Collect and review Activity Page 12.1 to monitor students’ understanding of the

spellings for /d/ and when to double the final ‘d’ to add a suffix.

Lesson 13 Spelling Alternatives: Review /f/ › ‘f’ and ‘ff’
**149**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


Today you will review two of the important spellings for the /f/ sound: the
basic code spelling ‘f’ as in _fit_, and the spelling alternative ‘ff’ as in _stuff_ . The
following chart shows how common each spelling is.


Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


 - ‘ **f** ’ is the most common spelling. It is used in initial position ( _fun_, _fig_ ), final
position ( _leaf_, _deaf_ ), in the initial consonant clusters _fl–_ and _fr–_ ( _flop_, _fresh_ ),
in the final consonant clusters _–ft_, _–fth_, and _–lf_ ( _life_, _fifth_, _elf_ ), and with
separated digraphs ( _safe_, _life_ ).


 - Only ‘ **f** ’ is used at the beginning of words and syllables, but both spellings are
used at the end of words or syllables.


 - ‘ **ff** ’ is commonly found after “short” vowel sounds written with single-letter
spellings; thus we write _stiff_, but _deaf_ .


 - Words with final /f/ tend to keep the spelling they have in the root form, even
when suffixes beginning with a vowel sound are added: _leaf_  - _leafy_ ; _oaf_  _oafish_ ; _stuff_  - _stuffy_ .


 - The spelling alternatives ‘ **ph** ’ ( _phone_, _physical_ ) and ‘ **gh** ’ ( _laugh_, _tough_ ) will be
taught in Grade 2.


**Foundational Skills**

 - Prepare to display the Consonant Code Flip Book within view of all students.
You may wish to tab page 9.

alternatives for /f/: ‘f’ and ‘ff’. Write the spellings on the board.


  - Tell students to write each word that you say.


  - For each word that you say, hold up one finger for each sound.


  - Ask students to count the sounds in the word and then draw a line on their
paper for each sound that they heard. For example, for the word _stuff_, four
lines would be drawn on the paper: __ __ __ __.


  - Once students have drawn one line for each sound in the word, remind them
that the sound /f/ can be spelled with two letters.


  - Have students write the spellings on their respective lines: s t u ff.


  - Finally, ask students to read the word back to you.

Lesson 14 Spelling Alternatives and Tricky Word: Introduce /v/ › ‘v’ and ‘ve’; Introduce: Picture
**161**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


Today you will introduce the only significant spelling alternative for the /v/
sound. Students should already know the basic code spelling ‘v’ as in _van_ . In
this lesson you will review that spelling and introduce the spelling alternative
‘ve’ as in _twelve_ . The following chart shows how common each spelling is.


Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


  - ‘ **v** ’ is used as a spelling for /v/ at the beginning of words and syllables
( _vet, vent_ ); it is seldom found at the end of words ( _Kiev, Pavlov_ ).


  - ‘ **ve** ’ is used at the end of words ( _twelve, serve, carves_ ).


 - Many ‘ **ve** ’ words change to ‘ **v** ’ when suffixes are added ( _carve_  - _carving_ ).


**Foundational Skills**

 - Display the Consonant Code Flip Book within view of all students. You may
wish to tab page 10. Also have the Spelling Card listed in the Lesson at a Glance
chart, student Individual Code Charts, and red markers readily available.


 - Write the Tricky Word _picture_ on a yellow index card.


**Reading**

) **Digital Component 14.1**


 - Create the Preview Spellings chart for Introduce the Story on the board/
chart paper, or use the digital version (Digital Component 14.1).


 - Plan small groups for the Reading lesson.


 - Write some of the words or phrases from Additional Support in previous
lessons on the board. If some pairs finish early, they can illustrate one of
the words or phrases.

~~**MINIMAL PAIRS /F/ AND /V/ (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that today they are going to review the /v/ sound as in _van_ .


  - Have students say the /v/ sound several times, stretching it out.


  - Ask students whether /v/ is a vowel sound or a consonant sound. _(It is a_
_consonant sound, made with the teeth and lips touching to obstruct airflow.)_


  - Tell students that you are going to say word pairs. The words will be very
similar, but one word will begin with the /v/ sound and the other word will
begin with the /f/ sound.


  - Have students repeat the sounds /f/ and /v/.


  - Have students close their eyes and listen as you say the first word pair from
the following box


  - Ask students which word contains the /v/ sound.


  - Have students repeat both words to hear and feel the difference in
articulation. Students can touch their voice boxes with their fingers to feel
the difference between /f/ and buzzy /v/.


  - Work through the remaining pairs.



1. van—fan


2. vat—fat


3. vine—fine



4. views—fuse

~~**SPELLINGS FOR /V/ (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students you will first review the basic code spelling for /v/ and introduce
a new spelling alternative.

|1.<br>/v/ > ‘v’ (_van_) **page 10**<br>2.<br>/v/ > ‘ve’ (_twelve_) **page 10**|1.<br>/v/ > ‘v’ (_van_) **page 7**<br>2.<br>/v/ > ‘ve’ (_twelve_) **page 7**|




- Turn to **Consonant Code Flip Book page 10**, and review that ‘v’ is one way
to spell the /v/ sound. Read the sample word and discuss the power bar.


- Write ‘v’ on the board, along with the two sample words listed in the
following box.


- Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart page 7** and outline the ‘v’
spelling in red marker to show that it is a spelling they have learned for a
consonant sound.


- On **Consonant Code Flip Book page 10**, put the Spelling Card ‘ve’ > /v/
( _twelve_ ) on the appropriate space. Have students read the sample word.
Discuss the length of the power bar. Explain that the short power bar means
that the /v/ sound is sometimes spelled this way.


- Write ‘ve’ on the board, along with the two sample words listed in the
following box.


- Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart page 7** and outline the ‘ve’
spelling in red marker to show that it is a spelling they have learned for a
consonant sound.


- Have students trace the spelling on their desks with a pointed finger while
saying the sound.


- Tell students that whenever the spelling ‘ve’ appears on an activity page or in
a story for the next few lessons, it will be printed in darker, bolder letters to
remind them that the two letters stand for a single sound.


- Tell students that they can refer to their Individual Code Chart whenever they
are having trouble remembering spelling alternatives for the /v/ sound.


1. v: _van_, _vet_ 2. ve: _sleeve_, _carve_



**164**


~~**FILL IN THE BLANKS (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 14.1.


 - Explain that the words in the box contain the sound /v/ spelled ‘v’ or ‘ve’.


 - Have the students read the words in the box aloud and underline the target
spellings ‘v’ and ‘ve’. Students should then fill in the blanks in the sentences
with the best choice from the box.


Activity Page 14.1: Fill in the Blanks Spelling Alternatives for /v/


Collect and review Activity Page 14.1 to monitor students’ understanding of the

spelling alternatives for /v/.


~~**INTRODUCE TRICKY WORD: PICTURE (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Write the Tricky Word _picture_ on the board, and ask students how they
would pronounce it by blending. (They might say something like
/p/ /i/ /k/ /t/ /ue/ /r/.)


**Note:** Alternatively, you can ask students how they would spell the word
_picture_ . They will probably come up with a spelling like _piccher_ or _pikcher_ .
Explain that in this word the sounds /ch/ /er/ are spelled ‘ture’.


 - Explain that we actually pronounce this word /p/ /i/ /k/ /ch/ /er/ as in,
“He took my picture with his new camera.”


 - Circle the letters ‘p’, ‘i’, and ‘c’ and explain that they are pronounced just as
one would expect, as /p/ /i/ /k/.


 - Underline ‘ture’ and explain that this is the tricky part of the word. The letters
‘t’, ‘u’, ‘r’, and ‘e’ stand for the /ch/ /er/ sounds.


 - Tell students that when reading _picture_, they have to remember to pronounce
the letters ‘t’, ‘u’, ‘r’, ‘e’ as /ch/ /er/.


 - Have students copy the word on an index card and underline the tricky part
of the word.

 - After all the words have been called out, tell students you will now dictate a
sentence that uses a spelling word. They will write the entire sentence on the
back of Activity Page 15.1. Say, “I will sell your magic beans.”


 - Tell students that you will now show them the correct spelling for each word so
they can correct their own work.


 - Say and write each word on the board, instructing students to correct their
work by crossing out any incorrect spelling, and writing the correct spelling
next to it.

**Primary Focus:** Students will distinguish between facts and opinions in oral
sentences and will identify the sentence that provides the author’s opinion in a
written paragraph about _The Green Fern Zoo_ . ~~**TEKS 1.9.E**~~


~~**INTRODUCE OPINION WRITING**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.9.E**~~


**Opinions vs. Facts**

  - Remind students that they have learned to write different types of text,
such as narratives, book reports, and descriptions.


  - Tell students that today they will begin to learn about a text type in which
they state their opinion about something.


  - Explain that an opinion is your personal view or belief (i.e., what you think
about something).


  - Give an oral example of an opinion: “I think hot summer days are the best!”
Not everyone thinks that hot summer days are the best; some people do not
like them. So, saying that I think hot summer days are the best is an opinion,
not a fact. A fact is something that is true and can be proven.

their opinion (e.g.,
_friendly_, _soft_, _fun_, _plays_,
_cuddly,_ _quiet_ ).


Intermediate
Have students use
familiar vocabulary and
complete sentences to
support their opinion.


Advanced/Advanced High

Provide minimal support

encourage students to use
detailed sentences.


~~**ELPS 3.B; ELPS 3.G**~~


**178**




 - Give an oral example of a fact: “On hot summer days, the temperature
outside rises.”


 - Tell students that you are going to read several sentences and you want them
to tell you whether each sentence is an opinion or a fact.


 - Read the statements from the following box. Pause after each statement
and ask students if it is an opinion or a fact. If students have difficulty with
any of the statements, remind them that an opinion is a belief or a personal
preference and a fact is something that is known to be true.


**Note:** These sentences are not entirely decodable and are meant to be used
orally in this exercise.


1. Dogs are animals. _(fact)_


2. Dogs are the smartest animals. _(opinion)_


3. Math is the best subject. _(opinion)_


4. [student’s name] goes to [name of school]. _(fact)_


5. The color of grass is green. _(fact)_


6. The prettiest color is purple. _(opinion)_


 - Explain that in writing a longer text, such as a paragraph that states an
opinion, the writer states an opinion and gives the reader reasons for that
opinion. Tell students that when a writer states an opinion, they are taking
a stand on a subject and is prepared to explain why.


 - Illustrate the above by elaborating on the previous opinion example about
hot summer days: “I think hot summer days are the best because I can
go swimming!”


 - Tell students that in this example you are taking a stand that you love hot
summer days. The reason or explanation why you took that stand is that
you can go swimming. Point out that you used the linking word _because_ to
introduce the reason why you love hot summer days.


 - Ask students to think of their favorite animal. They should take a stand
on their favorite animal using the following sentence starter: _My favorite_
_animal_ _is_ . Tell them to think of two reasons, or explanations for,
why they like that animal.


 - Have a few students take turns sharing what their favorite animal is and
giving two reasons why. Remind students to use the linking word _because_ to
introduce the reasons why they like the animal.


**Analyze Parts of an Opinion Paragraph**

) **Digital Component 15.1**


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 15.2 as you display your enlarged version.


 - Explain that this is an example of an opinion paragraph. It takes a stand,
or states an opinion, and gives reasons for that opinion/stand. Explain that
today you are going to pay close attention to the parts of the paragraph and
identify why each part is important.


 - Have a student read the paragraph aloud.


 - Point out that this piece of writing has a title and a body. The body is written
in paragraph format with the first line indented.


 - Discuss with students the opinion stated in the paragraph ( _The Green Fern Zoo_ is
the best book ever) and the reasons given for that opinion (Vern tells lots of fun
facts about the critters, and the snapshots make you feel close to the critters).


 - Point out the linking word _because_ used in the third sentence. Note that it is
used to introduce the reasons that support the opinion in the first sentence.


 - Explain that an opinion paragraph has several elements—a title, a starting
sentence that states an opinion, one or two sentences that give reasons for
that opinion, and an ending sentence.


 - Ask students the name of the subject the writer took a stand on in the
paragraph. ( _“The Best Book Ever”_ )


 - Read the starting sentence, and explain that this sentence tells the reader
what the paragraph is about. It states the writer’s opinion that they think the
best book ever is _The Green Fern Zoo_ .


 - Have students underline the starting sentence in green on Activity Page 15.2
and write an “O” next to it in the margin to label it as the author’s opinion, as
you do so on the enlarged version.


 - Point out that when you write about a favorite book, it is a good idea to state
briefly what the book is about. This can be done in a sentence that follows
the starting sentence, as in this example.


 - Read the next sentence, and tell students that this sentence gives a _reason_
why the writer likes the book. Have students underline this sentence in blue
and write _1_ next to it in the margin to show that it is the first reason that
supports the opinion, as you do so on the enlarged version.


 - Read the next sentence, and tell students that the writer gives another
reason why they like the book. Have students underline this sentence in

purple and write _2_ next to it in the margin to show that it is the second reason
that supports the opinion, as you do so on the enlarged version.


  - Read the last sentence, and explain that this is the ending sentence. It lets
the reader know that it is the end of the paragraph.


  - Note that in this ending sentence, the writer makes a suggestion to the
reader based on their opinion.


  - Quickly review with students the parts of the paragraph: a title, an opinion
sentence, one or two sentences that give reasons, and an ending sentence.

the letter cards.


  - Say the first word from the following box.


  - Students echo the word and then individually work to select the letter cards
for the sound/spellings identified as they segment the word into phonemes.


  - Have students place the letter cards directly below the boxes in the correct
positions from left to right. Tell students they will not always use all the
sound boxes.


  - Once you see students are ready, ask them to push the cards into the
boxes from left to right and say the sound as each letter card is pushed.

~~**MORE HELP WITH FACT AND OPINION**~~


  - Write pairs of fact and opinion statements on the same topic on the
**board/chart paper or on sentence strips** . Possible topics may relate
to animals, school, weather, games, families, etc.


  - Remind students that a fact is something that is true. Also remind them
that an opinion is your personal view or belief (i.e., what you think about
something).


  - Give an oral example of an opinion: “Biographies are the best kind of books
to read!”


  - Explain that not everyone thinks that biographies are the best kind of books
to read; some people do not like them. So, saying that you think biographies
are the best kind of books to read is an opinion, not a fact. A fact is something
that is true and can be proven.


  - Give an oral example of a fact: “A biography is a story about a person’s life.”


  - Tell students that you are going to read several sentences and you want them
to tell you whether each sentence is an opinion or a fact.


  - Read the statements you prepared in advance. Pause after each statement
and ask students if it is an opinion or a fact. If students have difficulty with
any of the statements, remind them that an opinion is a belief or a personal
preference and a fact is something that is known to be true.

  - Tell students that today they are going to review the /r/ sound as in _red_ .


  - Have students say the /r/ sound several times, stretching it out.


  - Ask students whether /r/ is a vowel sound or a consonant sound. _(It is a_
_consonant sound, made with the back of the tongue curled back toward the_
_roof of the mouth to obstruct airflow.)_


  - Tell students that you are thinking of a word that begins with the /r/ sound;
you want them to guess what it is, but first you will give them a clue.

- Turn to **Consonant Code Flip Book page 18**, and review that ‘r’ is one way to
spell the /r/ sound. Read the sample word and discuss the power bar.


- Write ‘r’ on the board, along with the two sample words listed in the following
box: _rock_, _grin_ .


- Turn to **Consonant Code Flip Book page 18**, and review that ‘rr’ is another
way to spell the /r/ sound. Read the sample word and discuss the power bar.


- Remind students that the double-letter spelling ‘rr’ is also sometimes used for
the /r/ sound. Write this spelling on the board, along with the sample listed in the
following box.


- Point out that the ‘rr’ is a spelling that comes after a vowel spelling.


- Tell students you will now show them a new spelling for the /r/ sound.


- Show students the Spelling Card ‘wr’ > /r/ ( _wrist_ ), and place it on the
appropriate space on **Consonant Code Flip Book page 18** . Have students
read the sample word. Discuss the length of the power bar. Explain that the
short power bar means that the /r/ sound is only spelled this way sometimes.


- Write ‘wr’ on the board, along with the two sample words listed in the
following box.


- Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart page 7** and outline the ‘wr’
spelling in red marker to show that it is a spelling they have learned for a
consonant sound.

~~**SPELLING TREE FOR /R/ (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Show students the prepared Spelling Tree. Tell students that this Spelling
Tree will help them keep track of and organize the different spellings for the
/r/ sound.


 - Point to the trunk labeled /r/, and tell students to say the /r/ sound. Tell them
that you are going to add leaves to the different branches of this tree. All of
the words that you put on the Spelling Tree will have the /r/ sound.


 - Point to the branches of the Spelling Tree, and explain that each branch will
represent a different spelling for /r/. Review the spellings on the branches,
and note that the branches are like the power bars because they show how
common a spelling is for a sound. The longest branches show the most
common or most frequent spelling.


 - Point out that the odd ducks branch is the shortest. Explain that words with
unusual spellings are called odd ducks. Odd ducks are Tricky Words, and like
Tricky Words, odd ducks are on yellow paper.


 - Show students the following leaves, one at a time: _rich_, _ferret_, and _written_ .
Ask students to read one word at a time. Then ask one student to tell you
on which branch you should place this leaf/word; then tape that leaf to the
Spelling Tree. Continue until all three of the leaves have been read and placed
on the appropriate branches.


 - Distribute the remaining leaves to pairs of students, one leaf per pair. Give
students one minute to practice reading the word with their partner and to
discuss the proper placement of each leaf on the Spelling Tree.


 - Call on each pair of students to show their leaf to their classmates. Have
them read the word and then direct you where to tape the leaf. Ask for
confirmation from the remainder of the class. Continue until all of the words
are placed on the Spelling Tree.



**188**


 - If time permits, ask several students if they can think of any other words
with the /r/ sound. Write each of these words on a leaf, and then ask
the student who suggested the word to place it on the correct branch. If
students came up with any odd ducks, copy those words onto the yellow,
duck-shaped cards.


 - Explain that you will be using the Spelling Tree as an organizer. Students will
have a chance to add more words to the Spelling Tree.


~~**COUNT THE /R/ SOUNDS (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 16.1.


 - Tell students that each sentence contains at least one word that has the /r/
sound. They should read the sentence and circle the ‘r’ spellings. The number
at the end of each sentence tells how many /r/ spellings are in the sentence.


 - Complete the activity page as a class.

Ask students what the difference is between an opinion and a fact.

_(An opinion is your belief or personal view about something, and a fact is something_

_that is known to be true.)_


) **Digital Component 15.1**


  - Direct students’ attention to the enlarged version of the opinion paragraph
titled “The Best Book Ever” from the previous lesson.


  - Prompt students to review the elements of an opinion paragraph from their
discussion of “The Best Book Ever,” which they read in the previous lesson
(title, starting sentence with opinion, providing at least two reasons to
support opinion, ending sentence).


  - Remind students that in an opinion paragraph the writer states their opinion
about something (takes a stand), tells a little about the thing, and gives
reasons for that opinion (tells why they took that stand). Point out that the
linking word _because_ is used to introduce each reason.


**Make a Plan**

  - Direct students’ attention to The Writing Process graphic you prepared in
advance and remind students that the first step in the writing process is
planning—thinking about what they will write about.


  - Tell students that they will plan an opinion paragraph about a favorite class
or school event.


  - Have students brainstorm a list of class or school events in which they
have participated during this school year. You may wish to record students’
ideas on the board/chart paper. (Try to use decodable words whenever
possible.)


  - Have students vote to select one of the ideas as a favorite class or school
event for the class to write an opinion paragraph about, or select one for
them in advance.


  - Remind students of that event and review what happened during the event,
asking students to share specific reasons why they enjoyed it.


  - Explain that the class experienced this event as a group, so it would be
possible to write an opinion about it as a group, saying what they liked about
it. However, an opinion paragraph is usually written from the point of view of
a single person instead of a group.


**• Explain that you would like the class to plan an opinion paragraph**
**about the event as a group but use only one person as the writer.**
The whole class will help think and talk about the opinion paragraph, but it
will be only one student who writes it from their point of view.


  - Ask if anyone would like to volunteer to be the writer for the opinion
paragraph.


**Note:** If you think using a student to be the writer might be too confusing,
you can volunteer to be the writer.


  - Choose a student to be the writer. Explain that the whole class will be
planning the opinion paragraph, but it will be an opinion of the event as
experienced by this student.

 - Jot down the student’s opinion and reasons on the planning template.


 - Next, tell students that the class will work on writing a draft of the opinion
paragraph using the ideas they just planned. The planning template will help
you and the class complete the draft template together.


**Make a Draft**

 - Point to The Writing Process graphic, and remind students of the three steps
in the writing process—plan, draft, edit.


 - Tell students that the next step is to write a draft based on the plan.


) **Digital Component 16.3**


 - Direct students’ attention to the drafting template you prepared in advance.


 - Explain that the class will draft the opinion paragraph orally while you write
the draft on the template.


 - Tell students that the first thing they need to write on the draft is the title or
name of the subject.


 - Ask students for a title. Explain that a good title lets the reader know what
you are writing an opinion about.


 - If students have difficulty coming up with a good title, suggest a simple
decodable title (e.g., “The Best Class Trip Ever”).


 - Write the title on the top line of the display draft template under “Name
of Subject.”


 - Tell students that the first sentence of the opinion paragraph should state the
writer’s opinion or take a stand.


 - Have students help you come up with a good starting sentence for the
opinion paragraph (e.g., “The best class trip ever was . . .”).


 - Write the sentence below the title under “Take a Stand” on the draft template.


 - Point out that the sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a
punctuation mark. Also, point out that the sentence is indented (i.e., it starts
a bit further to the right than the other sentences in the paragraph).


  - Work with students to draft the opinion paragraph with two supporting
reasons and an ending sentence, asking students—and especially the
writer—to help you transform the ideas the class planned into complete
sentences. It might be good to ask the writer to share a reason first and
then have other students refine or expand on what the writer said.


  - Be sure to use the linking word _because_ to introduce each reason. Write
the first reason under “Tell Why #1” on the draft template. Write the second
reason under “Tell Why #2 _”_ on the draft template.


  - As you transcribe the oral sentences, remind students that written sentences
need to begin with a capital letter and end with a punctuation mark.


  - Tell students that the ending sentence should let the reader know that the
opinion paragraph is finished. A good ending sentence makes a suggestion
to the reader based on their opinion.


  - Work with the writer and other students to come up with a good ending
sentence for the opinion paragraph. Write the ending sentence on the draft
template under “End with a Zinger.” Tell students that a _zinger_ is a snazzy
statement that tries to convince the reader to take the same stand as
the author.


  - Read the draft to the class, or have a student read it aloud.


**Wrap-Up**

  - Remind students that in today’s lesson, they drafted an opinion paragraph
about a favorite class/school event, based on the plan they had made earlier.


  - Note that the whole class helped [writer’s name], who is the writer of the
opinion paragraph, to write the draft. Drafting is the second step in the
writing process.


  - Explain that the draft has a starting sentence that states the writer’s opinion,
a sentence that describes the topic, two more sentences that give reasons
supporting their opinion, and an ending sentence that wraps up the opinion
paragraph. The draft is written in paragraph format.


  - Tell students that in the next lesson, they will plan their own opinion
paragraph discussing their opinion of _Kate’s Book_ .


**Note:** Please save today’s completed plan and draft templates for future use.


Lesson 16 Writing: Plan and Draft an Opinion Paragraph as a Class
**193**


**Lesson 16: Spelling Words**

Language



10M



**Primary Focus:** Students will spell and write one- and two-syllable words with
/t/ > ‘t’ and ‘tt’, /d/ > ‘d’, ‘dd’, and ‘ed’, and /f/ > ‘ff’, and the Tricky Word _was_ .


~~**TEKS 1.2.B.vi; TEKS 1.2.C.i; TEKS 1.2.C.ii; TEKS 1.2.C.iii; TEKS 1.2.C.iv**~~


~~**INTRODUCE SPELLING WORDS**~~


       - Remind students that they will have a list of spelling words to practice and
learn each week.


       - Write the following headings on the board in columns: /t/ > ‘t’, /t/ > ‘tt’,
/t/ >‘ed’; /d/ > ‘d’, /d/ > ‘dd’, /d/ > ‘ed’; /f/ > ‘ff’.


       - Read and write each spelling word, underlining and reviewing the spellings
for the /t/, /d/, or /f/ sounds in each word. Have students repeat each word
after you. Remind students that the last word is a Tricky Word. Tricky Words
do not follow the rules, so their spellings must be memorized.


       - Ask one or more students to use each word in a sentence, being sure to explain
vocabulary for any words they may not know. The words for the week are:

|/t/ > ‘t’|/t/ > ‘tt’|/t/ > ‘ed’|/d/ > ‘d’|/d/ > ‘dd’|/d/ > ‘ed’|/f/ > ‘ff’|Tricky Word|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|truck•er|kitt•en|parked|duck|add|planned|off•er|was|



       - Tell students they will also spell an entire sentence that uses one of the
words. Have them practice in their Dictation Journals with the following
sentence: _It was a duck, not a kitten._


       - Remind students they will have an assessment at the end of the week, so it is
important to practice their spelling words at home.

~~**MORE HELP WITH SPELLING ALTERNATIVES FOR /R/**~~


**Word Collection**

 - Tell students that you would like them to help you make a collection of words
that have the /r/ sound.


 - Review the spellings for /r/ using **Individual Code Chart page 7** .


 - Write the headers on the board/chart paper for the sound /r/: ‘r’, ‘rr’, ‘wr’.


 - Ask students to tell you words that contain the /r/ sound.


 - Write the words under the appropriate header.


   - If students give you words that are not decodable, add them to the list and
point out the tricky parts of the word. For example, if a student says the
word _furry_, you would want to briefly explain the ‘ur’ spelling for /er/ and
the ‘y’ spelling for /ee/.


 - Repeat until you have multiple examples of each spelling pattern.


 - Use the word lists under each header to review the spellings and point out
which spelling is more common.


 - To provide students with practice spelling entire sentences, dictate a
sentence using one of the words from the Individual Code Chart. Have
students write the entire sentence in their Dictation Journal.


**Code Knowledge**


Before today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
610 and 770 of those words would be completely decodable.


After today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
610 and 771 of those words would be completely decodable.

  - Tell students to read today’s story to find out what the bone man has to say
about Kate and Gad’s discovery. Remind students that the bone man in this
story is a paleontologist.


  - Also ask students to try to figure out the meaning of the word _extinct_ . Tell
students that if they do not know what a word means, they can use context
clues to try and figure it out. Context clues can be things said in sentences
that help you figure out what the word means. Tell students that you would
like them to use context clues to figure out what the word _extinct_ means,
and you will discuss their ideas as a class at the end of the story.

~~**PLAN AND DRAFT AN OPINION PARAGRAPH INDEPENDENTLY (30 MIN.)**~~


**Review**

) **Digital Component 16.1**


  - Point to The Writing Process graphic, and remind students that first they
planned an opinion paragraph about a favorite class trip, and then they
helped draft the paragraph in complete sentences using the template.


  - Ask students what an opinion paragraph is. Have a few of them quickly share
what the class opinion paragraph was about.


  - Explain to students that in today’s lesson they will plan and draft another
opinion paragraph on their own, this time writing a letter to Kate telling their
opinion of her book.


**Make a Plan**

  - Have students turn to Activity Page 17.2.


**TEKS 1.11.A** Plan a first draft by generating ideas for writing such as by drawing and brainstorming; **TEKS 1.11.B** Develop
drafts in oral, pictorial, or written form by (i) organizing with structure; (ii) developing an idea with specific and relevant details;
**TEKS 1.12.C** Dictate or compose correspondence such as thank you notes or letters; **TEKS 1.11.E** Publish and share writing.



**204**


  - Explain that the first thing students need to do is to state their opinion or take a
stand on _Kate’s Book_ . This will be the first sentence of their opinion paragraph.


  - Ask students to share their thoughts on _Kate’s Book_ with a partner. Offer the
following questions as suggestions for helping students discuss the text:


    - Did you enjoy the book?


    - Which part(s) did you like most?


    - If you did not enjoy the book, which parts did you enjoy least?


  - Write some or all of the ideas on the board; one student’s idea may help
another student develop their own ideas.


  - When you feel like most students have taken a stand on _Kate’s Book_, give
students sentence starters for how to state their opinions and take their
stands, such as “I liked/did not like _Kate’s Book_ ” or “ _Kate’s Book_ is fantastic
and could be the best book ever!”


  - Have students use Activity Page 17.2 to come up with two reasons that
support their opinion of _Kate’s Book_ . Encourage students to use the word
_because_ to introduce each reason.


  - Have students work in pairs. Tell students to take turns sharing what their
favorite part of _Kate’s Book_ is, giving several reasons why. Remind students
to use the linking word _because_ to introduce the reasons why they liked or
did not like her book.


  - Quickly summarize what students have done so far: They have finished the
first step in writing their own opinion paragraph—planning. To do this, they
stated their opinion or took a stand and brainstormed several reasons to
support their opinion.


  - Tell students that next they will write a draft of their opinion paragraphs.
Drafting is the second step of the writing process.


**Make a Draft** ~~**TEKS 1.12.C**~~

  - Have students turn to Activity Page 17.3.


  - Explain to students that they need to transform the ideas that they
brainstormed on the planning template into sentences to write on the
drafting template.


  - Tell students that this drafting template looks a little different than the one
they used for the class opinion paragraph about the best school or class
event ever, because this one is set up to help them write a letter to Kate
explaining their opinion of her book.


**TEKS 1.12.C** Dictate or compose correspondence such as thank you notes or letters.



Support


Provide oral sentence
starters for stating the
reasons students like or
dislike _Kate’s Book_ (e.g.,
“I liked the part
the most because . . .” or
“I liked the part
the least because . . .”).


Activity Page 17.3



Lesson 17 Writing: Plan and Draft an Opinion Paragraph Independently
**205**


 - Note that letters always begin with “Dear . . .” _Dear_ is a Tricky Word that is
pronounced /d/ /ee/ /r/, just like the forest animal. The /ee/ sound in _dear_
is spelled ‘ea’.


 - Remind students that the first line of a paragraph is always indented.
Show students proper indentation for letters relative to the margin.


 - Students should use their planning template on Activity Page 17.2 to help
them write the letter to Kate, as the drafting template on Activity Page 17.3
only provides guidelines for writing a friendly letter. Review the following:


   - The starting sentence of their opinion paragraph should state their opinion
or take their stand.


   - The second sentence should briefly describe _Kate’s Book_ . The next
sentences should give two reasons to support their opinion.


   - They should use the linking word _because_ to introduce each reason.


   - The last sentence of the opinion paragraph is the ending sentence, which
lets the reader know that the paragraph is finished. It might make a
suggestion to the reader based on their opinion.


 - Last, students should end the letter by writing a closing and signing their
names. (You might choose a decodable closing such as _Cheers_, _Your fan_, etc.,
or teach students the closing _Sincerely_ as a Tricky Word.)


 - Direct students’ attention to the chart of Tricky Words you prepared in
advance. Tell students they can reference this chart as they write if they
want to include some of these words in their paragraphs.

**Group 1:** Ask students who are able to do so to complete the draft on their own.
If students finish quickly, have them sit in pairs and read their opinion paragraphs
to each other. You can also have them draw a picture to accompany their opinion
paragraph or copy the draft to a clean sheet of paper.


**Group 2:** Have students who need more support drafting their opinion
paragraph form a group. Have students write their starting sentence, and
have some of them share it with the group. Students should then write a brief
description of _Kate’s Book_ . Instruct students to work on their reasons next,
reminding them to use the linking word _because_ to introduce each one. Work
one-on-one if necessary. Have students check in with you before they write
their ending sentence. While students are wrapping up, check in on Group 1.


  - Congratulate students on having completed their drafts.


  - Pointing to The Writing Process graphic, explain that they have finished the
first two steps of the writing process—planning and drafting. Tell students
the next step in the writing process is editing.


  - Remind students that editing is what you do when you try to make a draft better.


  - Tell students that you will select one student from the class to be the author
of the day in the next class. The author of the day will share their draft with
the class. The class will say what they like about it and also offer some
suggestions for how the author might make it even better. The whole class
will work on editing the student’s draft. ~~**TEKS 1.11.E**~~

**Writing**

 - Select a student to be the author of the day from among students who
volunteered for the task when they placed a star next to the title of their
draft. The ideal draft will be one that is good but capable of improvement
and, specifically, could be improved in one or more of the areas listed on the
editing checklist (Activity Page 18.1). Before the lesson begins, please let that
student know that they have been chosen to be the author of the day.


 - Copy the selected student’s draft—including any errors—onto chart paper,
skipping every other line to leave room for editing. You may wish to number
the sentences using a different color ink. This will make it easier to refer to
specific parts of the paragraph.

Collect students’ dictation papers to review and monitor student progress.


  - After students complete the Sound Dictation activity, explain that you are
going to dictate some multisyllabic words for them to spell. Provide words
with closed, r-controlled, and open syllables that use the sound spellings
in the box above, such as _nagging, fringe, turkey, artist, amaze,_ and _human._
Remind students that closed syllables have a short vowel sound and end with
a consonant, as in _kit•ten._ Tell them that vowels in r-controlled syllables are
influenced by the consonant _r_ as in _far•mer,_ and open syllables end in a vowel
and make the long vowel sound as in _ba•by._


**TEKS 1.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling words with closed syllables, open syllables, VCe

to prompts, will use adjectives and prepositions, and will write two complete
sentences of at least five words. ~~**TEKS 1.11.D.iv; TEKS 1.11.D.vi**~~


~~**BUILD SENTENCES**~~


  - Remind students that they have been learning about different types of
sentences (statements, questions, and exclamations). Tell students that they
will now practice building sentences, meaning they will practice making their
sentences longer and more interesting.


  - Say the sentence, “Doba cooks.”


  - Have students repeat the sentence.


  - Tell students you will build this sentence by saying what Doba cooks.
Ask students, “What does Doba cook?”


  - Say a sentence to include what Doba cooks (e.g., “Doba cooks corn.”).
Have students repeat the sentence.


  - Ask students, “What adjective can we use to describe what type of corn
Doba cooks?” Build on the sentence with an adjective describing the type
of corn Doba cooks (e.g., “Doba cooks fresh corn.”). Have students repeat
the sentence.


  - Ask students, “Where does Doba cook the fresh corn?” Tell them you can
build a sentence by describing where an action takes place. Repeat the
sentence by adding a prepositional phrase (e.g., “Doba cooks fresh corn
in the kitchen.”).


  - Tell students that you started with a two-word sentence, “Doba cooks.”
You then added to the sentence by describing what Doba cooks (corn), an
adjective to describe the corn ( _fresh_ ), and where she cooks fresh corn (in the
kitchen). The sentence “Doba cooks fresh corn in the kitchen,” is much easier
to imagine because of these details.


  - Repeat this procedure with the following sentence starters, orally adding
words like adjectives and prepositions to the sentence.


**TEKS 1.11.D** Edit drafts using conventions of standard English, including (iv) adjectives, including articles; (vi) prepositions.



**214**


**Note:** Do not write these sentences on the board. They are meant to be used
orally in this exercise. Encourage students to add words that are decodable.


 - On the board, write this sentence: _Allen flips_ .


 - Have students read the sentence, and ask them what Allen flips.


 - Write the new sentence on the board (e.g., _Allen flips a coin._ ).


 - Have students read the sentence, and ask them where he flips the coin.


 - Write the new sentence on the board (e.g., _Allen flips a coin in the air._ ).


 - Ask students to tell you what kind of coin Allen flips (e.g., _Allen flips a silver_
_coin in the air._ ).


 - Repeat this procedure with the following sentence starters. (Decodable
additions have been provided.)






 - Direct students’ attention to the two starter sentences you prepared
in advance.

**Review**

  - Remind students that in the previous lesson they first planned and then
drafted their opinion paragraph. They planned and then wrote the draft in
paragraph format on the letter template.


) **Digital Component 16.1**


  - Pointing to The Writing Process graphic, explain that today they will work on
the third step in writing—editing. Explain that editing is what we do when we
try to make a draft better. Even professional writers do not write perfectly on
the first try. They edit and rework their writing to make it better.


  - Remind students that you asked them to volunteer if they wanted to be the
author of the day. Explain that you chose one student’s draft and that you
copied it on a piece of chart paper. The class will tell the author what they
like about the draft and provide a few friendly suggestions.


**Presenting the Student’s Draft**

  - Display the student’s draft.


  - Identify the author of the day, and invite the student to present their opinion
piece by reading it aloud.


**TEKS 1.11.C** Revise drafts by adding details in pictures or words; **TEKS 1.11.D** Edit drafts using conventions of standard

grade-appropriate orthographic patterns and rules and high-frequency words with adult assistance.



**216**


 - Ask the class to give the author a round of applause: “Let’s hear it for our author!”


 - Explain that you would like students to begin by telling the author something
they liked about their opinion paragraph. Model this for the class first by
telling the author something you liked about it.


 - Invite other students to say something they liked about the opinion
paragraph. Write down these positive comments on the board or on a
separate piece of chart paper.


**Edit the Student’s Draft**

 - Have students turn to Activity Page 18.1, and explain to students that this is
their editing checklist. It has some questions addressed to the author. The
questions are things the author might want to think about to make their
opinion letter even better.


 - Point out that this editing checklist is similar to the ones they have used
during previous writing projects. This editing checklist is specific to writing
a letter.


 - Pick a student to read the first question.


 - Ask the class if the draft on display has a date. If so, have students make a
checkmark next to that question on their editing checklist.


 - Work through the remaining questions, and discuss whether the item can be
checked—or whether improvements need to be made or could be made.


 - Remind students that the pronoun _I_ is always capitalized. and that the
correct pronouns are used and make sense in their writing ( _she, he, him, her,_
_they, them_ ).


 - Explain that adverbs of time can help students indicate the time when
something happened. Some adverbs of time include _always, never, often,_
_usually,_ and _sometimes._ Encourage students to use adverbs that convey time
in their writing.


 - Model making any changes to the draft that the class and author agree would
be changes for the better.


 - Use the following editing conventions when correcting the draft. Explicitly
review these conventions, explaining that this is how professional writers edit
their work. Explain that they will use these same conventions when they edit
their own work.


**Note:** Review these conventions orally only, because not all of the words
are decodable.



Activity Page 18.1



Lesson 18 Writing: Edit an Opinion Paragraph
**217**


 - If you think you have time before you have to move on to copying the draft,
you can go beyond the questions that are listed on the editing checklist. For
example, you can ask students if there are places where the author of the day
could add details.


 - You can also ask students if they have any other suggestions that would
improve the author’s writing. Explain to students that they should make
suggestions by asking the author questions.


 - Model this by using a formula like this: “Could we make the author’s writing
even better if we . . . ?” Using this formula, or similar phrasing, will make it
clear that the author is being given suggestions for consideration rather
than mandatory tasks.


 - If changes are suggested, check with the author to see if they like the idea.
Then make the changes on the chart paper. At this stage, two or three
suggestions are probably enough.


**Copy the Draft**

 - When you have finished editing the draft, explain that authors often want to
share their writing with other people.


 - Ask students, “Do you think it would be easy or difficult for someone other
than the author to read this draft? Why?”


 - Explain that to share the edited draft, it would have to be copied onto a clean
piece of paper, incorporating all of the changes made on the draft.


 - Close the discussion by thanking the author of the day once again and
thanking the class for helping the author with editing their work.


 - Summarize by saying that students have now gone through the three steps in
the writing process. They planned their opinion paragraph by brainstorming



**218**


ideas. They drafted their paragraph by writing the information from the plan
onto a template in paragraph format. Finally, they edited a draft by going
through an editing checklist and making changes to the draft to make it better.


  - If digital resources are available, provide students with opportunities for
using digital tools to publish their writing.


**Note:** It is strongly recommended that you allow time later in the day or
during subsequent lessons or the Pausing Point for students to use the
editing checklist (Activity Page 18.1) to edit, revise, and then publish their
own letters to Kate.

~~**BUILDING SENTENCES**~~


**Note:** Words like _in, out, at_, etc., are called prepositions. Students do not
need to identify these words as prepositions, but rather that they are useful
in building longer sentences.


  - Remind students that they have practiced building sentences. One way to
build a sentence is to add describing words or adjectives. Another way is to
tell where something is taking place, using phrases like _in the kitchen, out in_
_the school yard,_ etc.


  - Tell students that you will say a short sentence to them. It is a complete
sentence, but you want students to add onto it to make it a longer sentence
of at least five words.

  - Look at each word in the following box and notice where they are marked
with a syllable divider.


  - Say the first word from the box, _trooper_, and ask students to tell you how
many syllables there are. Remind students that every syllable has a vowel
sound; clap the number of syllables, if necessary.


  - Repeat the word _trooper_, pausing slightly between the syllables.


  - Now say the first syllable in a segmented fashion, marking each sound with
a finger tap, beginning with a thumb-forefinger tap (/t/ /r/ /oo/ /p/).


  - Say the second syllable in a segmented fashion, returning to the thumbforefinger tap for the first sound (/er/).


  - Say the blended word while making a fist.


  - Have students repeat the entire segmenting and blending process after you.


  - Continue this process with the remaining words. Point out whether the word
is a compound word, a root word with a suffix, or a word where the individual
syllables cannot stand alone as separate words.

Note to Teacher


Today you will administer the Unit 5 assessments. The first assessment
is a Word Recognition Assessment that targets the sound/spelling
correspondences taught in Unit 5. The second part is a Grammar
Assessment. Please note that if students appear too tired or unable to
concentrate after the first assessment, you may choose to read “The Scoop”
as a class for the remainder of the lesson, and complete the Grammar
Assessment the next day.


Refer to the Word Recognition Analysis Directions and Class Record and the
Grammar Assessment Analysis Directions, found in Teacher Resources. If a student
makes more than one error for any single sound/spelling on the Word Recognition
Assessment, their mastery of this spelling should be called into question.

/f/—/v/, /l/—/r/).


 - Label two boxes with the target sounds (e.g., /p/ and /b/).


 - Ask students to say the name of each object or picture, and ask them if it
contains the /p/ sound or /b/ sound.


 - Have students place the objects or pictures in the appropriate boxes.


~~**MORE HELP WITH SPELLING ALTERNATIVES**~~


**Sound/Spelling Review with Code Flip Books**

 - There are many ways to use the Code Flip Books for review. Here are
some ideas:


- Say a sound and ask students to show you the spelling(s) for the sound.


- Ask students to show you the spelling alternatives for a sound, (e.g., for the sound /r/).


- Ask students to show you the spellings that can stand for more than one sound.
_(‘g’, ‘ed’, ‘oo’)_ Ask them what these spellings are called. _(tricky spellings)_


- Ask students to show you the most common or least common spelling for a sound.


- Ask students to show you all of the double-letter spellings they have learned.


**Slap the Spelling**


**Note:** This game is best played in small groups or in centers.


 - Cut out a long, rectangular slip of paper and write ‘ve’ on each end. The
letters should face away from each other. (See illustration on next page.)
Repeat for ‘f’ and ‘t’.



**263**


 - Affix the cards in a row on the floor, or other surface, between two students
who are facing each other.


 - Explain that you will say a number of sounds and that you want students to
whack the correct spelling as fast as possible.


**Note:** You can play this game for all sounds and spellings taught/reviewed in
this unit. Choose sounds/spellings that are similar, for example, /t/ and /d/,
/f/ and /v/, /r/ and /l/, and /ch/ and /j/.


**Highlight Spellings**


**Note:** This game is best played in small groups or in centers.


 - Write a number of decodable words that contain the spellings taught in this
unit on a sheet of paper.


 - Ask students to read the words and highlight the new spellings.


**Spelling Bingo**


**Note:** Use locally approved free Bingo card generators.


 - Make Bingo cards with the spellings taught/reviewed in Unit 5 and other
spellings that have been taught so far.


 - Write the same spellings on paper slips, and put them in a box.


 - Give each student a Bingo card and playing pieces.


 - Explain that you will pull spellings from the box and that you want students to
put a playing piece on top of that spelling if it is on their Bingo card.


 - Explain that when all spellings are covered on a card, students should
say, “Bingo!”

**Handwriting Activity Pages with Consonant Spellings**

 - Have students complete Activity Pages PP.2 and PP.3.


**Word Sort**


**Note:** Both variations can be done for any of the sounds/spellings taught or
reviewed in this unit.


Variation 1


 - Write a number of decodable words that contain either of two target spellings
(e.g., ‘v’ and ‘ve’) on cards.


 - Label two boxes with the target spellings (e.g., ‘v’ and ‘ve’).


 - Have students read the words on the word cards, and ask them if they
contain the spelling ‘v’ or the spelling ‘ve’.


 - Have students place the cards in the appropriate boxes.


Variation 2


 - Write a number of decodable words with the three spellings for /r/ on word
cards, one word per card. You can also use white boards.



**266**


 - Distribute the cards/white boards.


 - Explain that you want students to form groups: one group for words with /r/
spelled ‘r’, one group for /r/ spelled ‘rr’, and one group for /r/ spelled ‘wr’.


**Spelling Tree**


**Note:** At the end of this unit, students will know a number of spellings for
the sounds /p/, /b/, /k/, /g/, /ch/, /j/, /t/, /d/, /f/, /v/, /r/, and /l/. See the
following box for a summary of the spellings.


 - Work with students to make an additional Spelling Tree for any one of the
sounds reviewed in Unit 5.


 - Work with students to cut leaves out of green paper.


 - Write decodable words with the spellings on the blank leaves.


 - Have students hang the words on the proper branch, sorting them
by spelling.


 - Keep the Spelling Tree up for a few weeks, and allow students to add
additional word-leaves to it from time to time.


**Spelling Alternatives Taught/Reviewed in Unit 5:**



1. /p/—‘p’ and ‘pp’


2. /b/—‘b’ and ‘bb’


3. /k/—‘c’, ‘k’, ‘cc’, ‘ck’


4. /g/—‘g’ and ‘gg’


5. /ch/—‘ch’ and ‘tch’


6. /j/—‘j’, ‘g’, ‘ge’


**Teacher Chaining**

 - Ask a student to read the word.



7. /t/—‘t’, ‘tt’, ‘ed’


8. /d/—‘d’, ‘dd’, ‘ed’


9. /f/—‘f’ and ‘ff’


10. /v/—‘v’ and ‘ve’


11. /r/—‘r’, ‘rr’, ‘wr’


12. /l/—‘l’ and ‘ll’




- Remove ‘p’ and add ‘tch’ to create _hitch_ .


- As you make this change, say to students, “If that is _hip_, what is this?”


- Ask students what change you made to the word hip to get the word _hitch_ .
Ask them whether you changed the first, middle, or last sound/spelling.


- Continue this process with the remaining words.



**267**


 - When you come to the end of the first chain, erase the board and begin the
next chain.


1. hip > hitch > hatch > hutch > hug


2. bat > batch > patch > pitch > ditch


3. ate > ape > age > page > cage


4. bar > barge > large > lard


5. gem > gems > germs > terms


6. wreck > wren > wrench > bench


**Teacher Chaining with Two-Syllable Words**

 - Write _kitch_ - _en_ on the board, inserting a dot divider in the middle of the word
at the location shown.


 - Ask a student to read the word.


 - Tell the class that you are going to change either the first syllable or the
second syllable to make a new word.


 - Remove _kitch_ and add _hidd_ to make _hidd_ - _en_ . (Do not erase the dot divider.)


 - As you make this change, say to students, “If that is _kitchen_, what is this?”


 - Continue this process with the remaining words.


1. kitch•en > hidd•en > writt•en > rott•en > rott•ing > runn•ing


2. swimm•ing > dress•ing > batt•ing > batt•er > farm•er > pitch•er > pitch•ing


3. mag•ic > trag•ic > pan•ic > pan•ther


4. switch•es > ditch•es > itch•es > hitch•es


**Word Sort**

 - Set up the pocket chart so it has headers for one of the following sets of
spellings: ‘t’, ‘tt’, and ‘ed’; ‘d’, ‘dd’, and ‘ed’; ‘c’, ‘k’, ‘cc’, and ‘ck’; ‘g’ and ‘gg’; ‘f’ and
‘ff’; ‘v’ and ‘ve’; ‘p’ and ‘pp’; ‘b’ and ‘bb’; ‘l’ and ‘ll’; ‘r’, ‘rr’, and ‘wr’; ‘ch’ and ‘tch’;
or ‘j’, ‘g’, and ‘ge’. There should be a header for each spelling in the chosen set.


 - Write a number of decodable words containing the spellings in the set you
chose on index cards.


 - Ask students to sort the words by placing them on the pocket chart under
the proper headers.



**268**


 - **Modification:** Set up two or more identical pocket charts, divide the class
into groups, and have the groups do the word sort as a race.


**Word Collection**


**Note:** This exercise can be done for any of the sound/spellings taught or
reviewed in this unit.


 - Tell students that you would like them to help you make a collection of words
that have the /p/ sound.


 - Ask students to tell you the spellings for the /p/ sound that they remember.


 - Write ‘p’ and ‘pp’ as headers on the board.


 - Ask students to tell you words that contain the /p/ sound.


 - Write the words on the board, placing them under a proper header.


 - Repeat until you have multiple examples of both spelling patterns
(‘p’ and ‘pp’).


 - Once multiple examples are on the board, use the chart on the board to
review the spellings, point out which spelling is more common, identify
spelling patterns, etc.


 - If students give you words that are not decodable, add them to the list and
point out the tricky parts of the word. For example, if a student says the word
_purse_, you would want to briefly explain the ‘ur’ spelling for /er/ and the ‘se’
spelling for /s/.


**Guess My Word**

 - Set up the pocket chart, or lay the cards on the table.


 - Arrange cards for the following vowel spellings along the top of the pocket
chart: ‘i’, ‘e’, ‘a’, ‘u’, ‘o’, ‘ar’, ‘er’.


 - Arrange cards for the following consonant spellings along the bottom of the
pocket chart: ‘m’, ‘n’, ‘t’, ‘ve’, ‘s’, ‘p’, ‘b’, ‘g’, ‘ge’, ‘l’, ‘wr’, ‘tch’, ‘ng’.


 - Think of a decodable word that you can build using the spellings shown, but
do not tell the class your word.


 - Tell students how many sounds are in your word.


 - Invite students to guess the word by asking whether or not it contains
specific sounds and/or spellings.


 - If students identify a spelling that is in the word, move that spelling to the
middle of the pocket chart.

~~**TRICKY WORD FAMILY LETTER**~~


Dear Family Member,


In this unit, your student will continue to learn new Tricky Words. Tricky Words are words that do
not follow the rules for encoding that your student has learned, so they simply must learn and
remember how to read and spell them. The tricky parts of each word are underlined. Your student
will be taught to read the following new words as Tricky Words: _how_ (Lesson 2), _stagecoach_ (Lesson
12), and _picture_ (Lesson 14). You are being provided with flash cards that include the new words
learned in this unit. Your student should already be able to read all of the other Tricky Words on the
flash cards successfully at the beginning of this unit, as they were taught in earlier units.


Please have your student cut out the flash cards. In order to build increasingly rapid, automatic
recognition of these words, show the cards to your student in random order and have them read
them to you as quickly as possible several times each week.

~~**TRICKY WORD ASSESSMENT RECORD: BEGINNING AND END OF UNIT 5 (OPTIONAL)**~~


**Name**


This is an optional assessment of previously taught Tricky Words. At the beginning and end of Unit 5,
show the student the Tricky Word list that follows this record.


Ask the student to read each word on the page from left to right, top to bottom. Provide students
with either a blank sheet of paper or card stock to place on the word list page directly under the row
to be read. As students complete a row, they can slide the paper down just enough to read the
next row.


Record each student’s performance in the following chart, using + to indicate that the word was
read correctly and – to indicate the word was read incorrectly; if the student misreads a completely
different word, record the word read by the student. Mark as incorrect any word that the student
does not read within 3–5 seconds.

~~**MAKING A SPELLING TREE**~~


Over the course of this unit, you will be asked to make and display a total of three Spelling Trees on
the walls of your classroom: one each for /k/, /j/, and /r/. If wall space for display is limited, you
may decide to use a chart tablet to create all of your Spelling Trees during the year. It is suggested
that you dedicate the chart pad to Spelling Trees only so you and students may use the pad as a
reference to quickly flip through and locate a particular Spelling Tree. Draw only one Spelling Tree
per page.


If wall display space permits, please make each Spelling Tree at least 24 inches x 18 inches,
preferably a good deal larger, making the trunk out of brown construction paper; otherwise, draw
the trunk on chart paper. For Lesson 4, label the trunk /k/.


For Lesson 4, make or draw five branches that will fork off from the central trunk. The branches should
vary in their length and correlate with the power bars for the various spellings on the Spelling Cards
and the Consonant Code Flip Book. The branches should diminish in size from the bottom of the
Spelling Tree up to the top. The largest, bottom branch should be labeled ‘c’; this is the most frequent
spelling for /k/. The next, slightly smaller branch should be labeled ‘k’ as this is the second most
frequent spelling of /k/. The next two branches should be approximately equal size, labeled ‘ck’ and
‘cc’, respectively. The top branch (and shortest) is for “odd ducks.” The odd ducks branch is a place for
you to include words that have the /k/ sound spelled in a way that is not explicitly taught in this unit.
In effect, the odd ducks are the exceptions to the spellings students have learned. Use the illustration
that follows to guide you in labeling and assembling the Spelling Tree.


Make multiple copies of the leaf template provided. The leaves should be big enough to write words
on them, small enough that you can fit at least twenty-five or thirty words on the Spelling Tree, but
not so small that the words are unreadable when mounted on the wall. The leaves are for words that
contain one of the spelling patterns.


For Lesson 4, write these /k/ words on the leaves: _car, cone, class, fact, cab_  - _in, pic_  - _nic, att_  - _ic, kite,_
_fork, skin, book, back, truck, brick, quack, hicc_  - _up, socc_  - _er_ . Also have some extra blank leaves
available for use during the lesson. Do not place the leaves on the Spelling Tree prior to the lesson;
you will do this with students. Have additional blank leaves as well.


Make multiple copies of the odd duck template onto yellow paper. These duck-shaped cards are
for odd ducks (i.e., words that have the /k/ sound but do not fall into any of the spelling patterns
that students have been taught). You do not need to write any words in advance on the odd duck
templates; just have these available during the lesson should students offer any odd duck spellings
for the /k/ sound.

~~**LESSON 5: SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


**Directions**


Write students’ names in the column provided. The words on today’s spelling assessment are
grouped on the analysis chart according to spelling patterns. Place an X in the column of any word
that the student did not spell correctly. Examine errors for patterns using the information provided
below. If a pattern is identified, speak with the student, and ask them to explain their thinking
to you. This may help you to understand the student’s confusion and allow you to clear up the
misunderstanding. You may also use previous Pausing Points to address errors with today’s
spelling words.


The words on this week’s spelling assessment can be analyzed in many different ways. Below,
analyses are provided that focus on errors in encoding the r-controlled vowel sounds in these words.


Column 1


**What an error in this column means:** These words contain the spelling ‘or’ for the /or/ sound.
Students may be having difficulty hearing the /or/ sound or remembering the spelling.


**What you should do:** Refer to the Unit 4 Pausing Point for additional exercises and targeted
lessons. Sound discrimination exercises targeting /or/ and the other r-controlled vowel sounds
may be a particularly helpful remediation.


Column 2


**What an error in this column means:** These words contain the spelling ‘ar’ for the /ar/ sound.
Students may be having difficulty hearing the /ar/ sound or remembering the spelling.


**What you should do:** Refer to the Unit 4 Pausing Point for additional exercises and targeted
lessons. Sound discrimination exercises targeting /ar/ and the other r-controlled vowel sounds may
be a particularly helpful remediation.


Column 3


**What an error in this column means:** These words contain the spelling ‘er’ for the /er/ sound.
Students may be having difficulty hearing the /er/ sound or remembering the spelling.


**What you should do:** Refer to the Unit 4 Pausing Point for additional exercises and targeted
lessons. Sound discrimination exercises targeting /er/ and the other r-controlled vowel sounds may
be a particularly helpful remediation.


Teacher Resources
**323**


Column 4


**What an error in this column means:** The word _said_ is a Tricky Word from Unit 2. Tricky Words
do not follow the rules for encoding that students have learned thus far. For now, students should
memorize how to spell this Tricky Word.


**What you should do:** Work with students to recognize that in the word _said_ the ‘ai’ work together
to stand for the /e/ sound. Additional practice reading and writing Tricky Words can be found in the
Pausing Points or in previous lessons.


Column 5


In the last column, specifically note any other confusion evidenced by individual student errors.
For example, students may have had difficulty encoding the consonant digraph in the word _porch_ .
Please also consider the influence of students’ home language on encoding. Analyze any patterns
and provide targeted remediation using previous Pausing Points.

You should take note of any difficulty students have in encoding other features of the words,
such as medial vowels and consonant clusters.


Column 1


**What an error in this column means:** In these words, the sound /ch/ is spelled with the consonant
digraph ‘ch’. Students who have difficulty encoding this consonant digraph may struggle with the
concept that two letters can work together to represent one sound.


**What you should do:** Refer to the Unit 5 Pausing Point for additional exercises and targeted lessons.


Column 2


**What an error in this column means:** In these words, the sound /ch/ is spelled with the consonant
trigraph ‘tch’. Students may be using the ‘ch’ spelling and might need practice determining when to
use the basic code spelling and when to use the spelling alternative.


**What you should do:** Refer to the Unit 5 Pausing Point for spelling alternative exercises and
targeted lessons that provide students with practice sorting words according to their spelling.


Column 3


**What an error in this column means:** In these words, the sound /sh/ is spelled with the consonant
digraph ‘sh’. Students who have difficulty encoding this consonant digraph may struggle with the
concept that two letters can work together to represent one sound.


**What you should do:** Refer to previous lessons, including Additional Support, for additional
exercises and targeted lessons.


Foundational Skills 5

Column 4


**What an error in this column means:** The word _how_ is a Tricky Word taught in Lesson 1 of this unit.
Tricky Words do not follow the rules for encoding that students have learned thus far.


**What you should do:** Remind students that in the word _how_, the ‘ow’ work together to stand for
the /ou/ sound, just like another Tricky Word they have learned, _down_ . For now, students should
memorize how to spell this Tricky Word. Additional practice reading and writing Tricky Words can be
found in the Pausing Points.


Column 5


In the last column, specifically note any other confusion evidenced by individual student errors.
For example, students may have had difficulty encoding the medial vowel sounds in words such

~~**GRAMMAR ASSESSMENT ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


Each grammar section contains five questions. If students scored at least 4 out of 5, they have a
good understanding of the grammar skills covered. If they scored 3 out of 5, you may ask a student
to explain what they were thinking when they wrote their answer to see if it was a careless mistake
or a genuine misunderstanding. For students scoring 2 or less, note that these students may need
more explicit instruction on the particular grammar skill. There will be opportunities for further
practice and remediation of these grammar skills in Units 6 and 7.

Chunking to Decode
Multisyllable Words


~~**TEKS 1.2.C.i; TEKS 1.2.C.ii; TEKS 1.2.C.iii; TEKS 1.2.C.iv**~~


Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught in this program will enable students to
read one-syllable words with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences
is no guarantee that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllable words. To
this end, most students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk and
read parts of words—syllables—as a way to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can then
be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated and students are expected
to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, this program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the easiest
two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is already a
familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In addition, each
syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing_, _hunt·er_, _bust·ed_ ). The
dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain double-letter
spellings for consonants, in this program, the divider is typically placed after the double-letter
spelling rather than between the two consonants (e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers familiar
with other ways to chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is done, however,
because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single-spelling units since Kindergarten
(‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.). This program strives to be consistent in representing these
spellings in the way that the students have been taught to process them (e.g., as whole entities
for a sound). (Ultimately, as students become more proficient at decoding and chunking syllables
through subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually chunk and decode
these words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding these two-syllable
words consisting of root words and suffixes relatively easy.


**TEKS 1.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling words with closed syllables, open syllables, VCe syllables, vowel teams, and r-controlled
syllable; (ii) spelling words with initial and final consonant blends, digraphs, and trigraphs; (iii) spelling words using sound-spelling patterns; (iv) spelling highfrequency words from a research-based list.


Appendix
**389**


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable words.
To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


 - **Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound**
**(e.g., /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/):** _let,_ _pad,_ _rod,_ _tin,_ _fun,_ _pic·nic,_ _un·til_


 - **Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/,**
**/ie/, /oe/, /ue/):** _cake,_ _home,_ _like,_ _mule,_ _Pete, mis·take, stam·pede_


 - **Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint,_ _speak,_ _proud,_ _play, dis·may, be·low,_ _coun·sel_


 - **R-Controlled Syllables:** _art,_ _curb,_ _girl,_ _fort,_ _clerk,_ _tur·nip, ar·tist, fe·ver_


 - **Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /ie/,**
**/oe/, /ue/):** _go, me, hi, a·pron, fi·nal, com·pre·hend_


 - **Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple, puz·zle, raf·fe, ca·ble, ri·fe_


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


 - **Schwa Syllables:** _ben·e·fit, ap·pe·tite, a·bout, hos·pit·al, e·mo·tion_


**Note:** The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately because
of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


**To be clear, in order to decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these**
**names. The names of the syllable types are provided here only to establish a common**
**vocabulary for teachers as they use the materials.** What is necessary, however, for students to
become fluent readers of longer words in increasingly complex text is that they be able to visually
parse certain spelling patterns as syllable chunks so they can quickly and easily decode each
syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in Kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


 - When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.


_ad · mit_ _nap · kin_ _trum · pet_



**390**


  - For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed after the
double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is one because the
double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units since Kindergarten
(‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).


_traff · ic_ _muff · in_ _happ · en_


  - When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.


_mon · ster_ _con · tract_ _pil · grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read
the first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model
for students how to blend the two syllables aloud:


In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the magic
‘E’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


  - Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for closed
syllables:


_tar_     - _get_ _for_     - _get_ _es_     - _cape_ _ig_     - _loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


In Grade 2, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to use
a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying each
possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


Appendix
**391**


 - When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:


_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_


However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There is
no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be flexible
and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to determine
whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. In order to recognize
whether a word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has
heard before (i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent
an additional challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a
second language.


 - If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:


_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is fairly straightforward.



**392**


  - When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings
in the words


_ban · gle_ _twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_


In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings represent
the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a combination of stressed
and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed or weakly stressed, its
vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that linguists call a schwa.
This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’ and ‘tion’.
Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite challenging for
many students.


  - Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the
schwa sound has a particular spelling:


_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is actually a schwa syllable, but it is identified
separately because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


  - Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables accordingly
throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre · tend_ _non · sense_ _tri · cycle_ _re · peat_ _self · ish_ _sad · ness_ _help · less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten–Grade
3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.
