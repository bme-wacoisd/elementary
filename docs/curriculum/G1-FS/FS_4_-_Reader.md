#### **Panthers**

If you look up on that rock, you
will see a cat that’s bigg· **er** than a
bob·cat . It’s a pan·th **er** .


_**What Panthers Look Like**_

Pan·th **er** s can have spots .
They can be tan, too . Here at the
Green F **er** n Zoo, we have two
black pan·th **er** s . The name of this
one is Jet .



32


Panthers are bigger than bobcats .



33


That’s Jet’s sis·t **er**, Flash, up on the
tree branch . Flash has strong legs
that help h **er** run fast . She has sh **ar** p
teeth and sh **ar** p claws that help h **er**
hunt rabb·its and deer . She can use

37


#### **Food Groundhogs Like**

Ground·hogs like to feed on
grass and plants . But when they
run out of their holes to get food,
they have to be on the look·out .
Some critt· **er** s, like bob·cats and
snakes, like to dine on ground·hogs .

up to see if there is a snake **or** a
bob·cat close by .

This groundhog is on the lookout for bobcats and snakes .



39


#### **More Food Groundhogs Like**

This ground·hog is named
Pepp· **er** . We feed h **er** grass, tree
b **ar** k, and in·sects, but the food that

and rabb·its to see him .



46


The pattern on the rattler’s scales
helps it hide in the desert .



47


A ratt·l **er** is not h **ar** m·less like a
g **ar** ·t **er** snake . If you ev· **er** see this
snake hiss·ing and coil·ing up, you
bett· **er** stand back and let it be . The
ratt·l **er** has sh **ar** p fangs, and a bite
from a ratt·l **er** could kill you . But we
are safe here in the rep·tile room .

safe from the snakes .

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully leveled
in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.

The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many spellings
can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to make early
reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of the available
spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out as part of their
phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been deliberately
introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if they are
assigned at the proper time.

As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first chapter of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final chapters in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.
