**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 6. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. The activity pages in this book do
not include written instructions for students because the instructions would have words that are
not always decodable. Teachers will explain these activity pages to the students orally, using the
instructions in the Teacher Guide. The Activity Book is a student component, which means each
student should have an Activity Book.

**In the Cave**


When I went to visit with Doba, I was sad. I missed Mom and Dad. But
Doba cheered me up and made things fun.


Doba took me on hikes. The land I saw in the Southwest was not at all
like the land I am used to. Where I am from, things are green in the summer,
and there are lots of trees. In the Southwest, there are hills and red rocks, but
not a lot of trees. In some spots, you can hike for a mile and not see one tree!


Once, Doba and I were on a hike when it started to storm. Doba and I
went into a cave so that we would not get wet.


As we were standing there, I saw something shimmer in the dark.


“Doba,” I said, pointing at the spot, “what’s that?”


“Well,” said Doba, “let’s have a look.”


We looked and saw something stuck in a crack in the rock. I grabbed it.


“It’s a coin!” I said.


“Well, I’ll be!” said Doba.


I said, “What sort of coin is it?”


Doba said, “I can’t tell. It looks like it could be made of silver.”


Then she said, “I have a pal, Sani, who is an expert on coins. We can bring
it to him tomorr ow, and he will tell us what sort of coin it is.”


I dropped the coin in my pocket, and we went on with our hike.

Today our class started Unit 6. The Reader for this unit is called _Grace._ Your student will
bring home stories you can read together about Grace and her life on a farm. Remember
that reading at home with your student is important for their success as a reader.

In addition, your student’s spelling words for this week include a review of previously
taught sound/spellings. As usual, there is one Tricky Word. Tricky Words do not play by the
rules, meaning there are spellings that do not sound the way students would expect them
to. Tricky Words need to be memorized, so your student will benefit from practice reading
and writing them.

We have been working on writing personal narratives at school. Your student has read
personal narratives and we have drafted a personal narrative as a class. Now, each student
will have an opportunity to write their own personal narrative describing something that
has happened to them. As homework, please work with your student to brainstorm ideas
that they might write about in a personal narrative. Remind your student that the personal
narrative should tell about something that has really happened to them. Here are some
ideas for topics your student might be interested in writing about:


     - a special holiday or birthday


     - a special present they received


     - something a friend or sibling did for them


     - a special visit or a trip to an interesting place


     - a “first” or significant personal achievement


     - a weather-related event


Have your student jot down ideas on the back of this page to bring back to school
tomorrow.

This is a story your student has read at school. Encourage your student to read the
story to you and then talk about it together. The tricky parts in Tricky Words are underlined.

Repeated oral reading is an important way to improve reading skills. It can be fun for
your student to repeatedly read this story to a friend, relative, or even a pet.


**Mister Spencer and the Rabbits**


Gra **c** e Spen **c** er’s dad has a farm. Her dad is
a farmer out in the Midwest, where the land is
flat and the soil is rich.


In the spring Mister Spen **c** er plants corn
next to the farmhou **se** . All summer long,
he takes care of the corn. By the end of the
summer, the corn is ripe. Then Mister Spen **c** er
harvests it and sells it. That is how he makes a
living.


Mister Spen **c** er has a garden, too. In his
garden he plants eggplants, beets, sprouts, and
peppers.


Mister Spen **c** er has had some problems
with rabbits. They crawl under the fen **ce**, hop
into his garden, and munch on his plants.
When Mister Spen **c** er sees the rabbits in his
garden, he gets mad as a hornet. He shakes his
fist and shouts at the rabbits.


Foundational Skills 6



**33**


Gra **c** e and her sister Jill like the rabbits.
Gra **c** e says they are cute. She tells her dad
to be ni **c** e and let the rabbits be. But Mister
Spen **c** er can’t stand those rabbits, and the
Spen **c** ers need the plants in the garden to
feed them in the winter.


Last summer, Mister Spen **c** er got a dog
to for **ce** the rabbits out of his garden. The
dog’s name is Pepper. He is a black dog. He
sleeps out in the barn.


When Pepper came to the farm, he gave
the rabbits quite a scare. They were in the
garden, munching on sprouts. Then Pepper
came charging out into the yard, barking.
The rabbits took off! They ra **c** ed back into
their hole as fast as they could.


Pepper ran to the rabbit hole and went
in as far as he could. He started digging with
his paws. But it was no use. It was a deep
hole and he could not get down to where
the rabbits were.


Mister Spen **c** er was sitting in the living
room at the time. He could tell what Pepper
was up to. He smiled. “Good dog!” he said.
“Good dog! I bet those rabbits will munch
on sprouts somewhere el **se** next time!”

**The Band**


Gra **c** e and Jill are in a band. Gra **c** e
toots on her trumpet. Jill toots on her slide
trombone.


When the children started out, they did
not sound too good. Jill and her trombone
sounded like a sick moo **se** . Grace and her
trumpet sounded like a flock of gee **se** .


The two of them made quite a racket.


It was so bad that Mister Spen **c** er would
yell, “I can’t take it!” Then he would run out
of the hou **se** and hide in the barn.


But, sin **ce** then, the children have gotten
a lot better, just as Mister Van **ce** said they
would. Mister Van **ce** is the band master.
He spends a lot of time with the children,
helping them get better.

**The Frog Jumping Contest**


There is a frog jumping contest at the park
this week, too.


“Did you get a frog for the contest?” Ken
asks. Gra **c** e nods. She sticks her hand in her
bag and grabs her frog. The frog sits on her
fi **n** gers.


“Cool!” Ken says. “What’s his name?”


“It’s a she!” says Gra **c** e. “Her name is
Hopper.”


“I got one, too,” says Ken. “His name is
Legs.” Legs has lo **n** ger legs than Hopper.


Gra **c** e and Ken take their frogs to the
starting line. They set the frogs down. The
starter shouts, “On your mark! Get set! Hop!”


“Jump!” Ken yells. “Jump!” Legs hops off.

Hopper jumps, too, but she jumps off to
the side.


“No, Hopper!” Gra **c** e yells. She runs and
grabs her frog. Then she sets her down with
her fa **c** e pointing at the finish line.


Hopper hops off. This time she is lined
up and on target.


Ken and Gra **c** e chase their frogs down
the track. The frogs are fast. It is a close
ra **c** e.


The two frogs cross the finish line at the
same time.


“Did Legs win?” Ken asks.


“Did Hopper win?” Gra **c** e asks.


“We have two winners!” says the man at
the finish line. “Hopper and Legs crossed
the line at the same time. They will share
the prize!”


The man hands Gra **c** e and Ken a cup for
their prize. Gra **c** e plops Hopper in the cup.
Ken adds Legs. Then they hoist the cup up
and shout, “Here’s to the champs!”

Prin **ce** Fran **c** is was ni **c** e, but he sometimes did
things without thi **n** king.

One morning Prin **ce** Fran **c** is felt sad. He
went to see his sister, Prin **c** ess Rose.

“I’m sad,” he said. “ **Wh** at can I do to make
myself feel better?”

“You should get a pet,” said his sister. “ **Wh** en I
feel sad, I visit with my cat. Then I feel better.”

“A pet!” said Prin **ce** Fran **c** is. “I like the sound
of that.” He shouted to his men, “Bring me my
hor **se** ! I will ride out and look for a pet!”

So Prin **ce** Fran **c** is rode out to look for a pet.
After a bit, he saw a sku **n** k. He had never seen a
sku **n** k.

“Look at that cat!” he said. “I have never seen a
cat like that! He’s black with a ni **c** e **wh** ite stripe
on his back. He will be the perfect pet for me!”

The prin **ce** ran back to his hor **se.** “Yuck!” he

The prin **ce** rode home. **Wh** en he got back,
the prin **c** ess helped him rin **se** off the sti **n** k.
She said, “Fran **c** is, that was not a cat. That was
a sku **n** k. Sku **n** ks do not make good pets. Let
me pick a pet for you. I have one that will be
perfect.”

The princess went and got a goo **se** . “This is a
ni **c** e goo **se**,” she said. “She is soft, she will not
bite, and she smells much better than a sku **n** k.”

The prin **ce** liked the goo **se,** and the goo **se** liked

“ **Wh** at is it?” **C** edric asks.


“I thi **n** k it’s a chu **n** k of a pot,” says
Ha **n** k. He dusts it off with his fi **n** gers and
says, “It could be a relic from a long time
back in the past!”


Back at the hou **se**, Ha **n** k hands the
pot shard to Gra **c** e. “Here,” he says. “This

“Tha **n** ks!” says Gra **c** e, with a smile.
Then she runs to get Ha **n** k and **C** edric
some corn muffins. They sit on the steps
and munch on the muffins.

**The Harvest Marvel**


After the harvest, the Spen **c** ers had a
Harvest Fest on their farm. A bunch of
children came.

“Have fun!” Mister Spen **c** er said to the
children. “And look out for the Harvest Marvel!”

“What’s the Harvest Marvel?” one of the

Gra **c** e ran up to the Harvest Marvel and tagged it. By ac **c** ident, she
**kn** ocked the pumpkin mask off of the Harvest Marvel.

“See!” Gra **c** e yelled. “It’s just Ha **n** k!”

**Wh** en the children saw that the Harvest Marvel was just Ha **n** k, they
ran up and jumped on top of him. Ha **n** k and the children were all smiles.
