# **Welcome!**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will learn five new vowel sounds along with the common spellings for the sounds, and they will

learn more about nouns, including proper nouns and sentence building.


**What** **will** **my** **student** **learn?**


Students will learn the following vowel sounds and the spellings for each sound: /ee/ spelled ‘ee,’ as in _seed_ ; /ae/

spelled ‘a_e,’ as in _cake_ ; /ie/ spelled ‘i_e,’ as in _line_ ; /oe/ spelled ‘o_e,’ as in _hope_ ; and /ue/ spelled ‘u_e,’ as in _cube_ . They

will also learn a strategy to help read these words and understand that when two letters are working together for a

single sound, the letters can be separated by a consonant, as in _sa_ _**m**_ _e_, _wi_ _**d**_ _e_, _to_ _**n**_ _e_, and _cu_ _**t**_ _e_ . Students will read a story

called “Gran,” about a well-traveled grandmother who visits her two grandchildren, Josh and Jen. Additionally,

students will answer questions about the story using complete sentences and will practice identifying nouns

whenever they are reading from the story.


**Additional** **Practice**

Students can practice these words each night by doing the following activities:


1. **Spell** **and** **Define:** Choose a few Tricky Words from the list and ask your student to spell each word aloud.

Once they've spelled it correctly, discuss the meaning of the word together.

2. **Sentence** **Creation:** Have your student use Tricky Words in sentences. Encourage them to create sentences

that demonstrate the meaning of the word and explain its context.

|_bee_|_shake_|_bike_|_note_|_cute_|
|_teeth_|_made_|_shine_|_vote_|_use_|


Students can practice these words each night by doing the following activities:


1. **Word** **Challenges:** Challenge your student to find words with the focus spelling patterns in books,

magazines, or around the house. When they identify a word, discuss its spelling and meaning.

2. **Drawing** **and** **Writing:** Invite your student to draw a picture that includes items with the focus spelling

pattern, then help them label the items in their drawing.
