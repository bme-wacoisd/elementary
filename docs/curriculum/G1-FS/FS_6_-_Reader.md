## **Mister Spencer and the Rabbits**

Gra **c** e Spen **c** er’s dad has a farm. Her dad is
a farmer out in the Midwest, where the land
is flat and the soil is rich.

In the spring Mister Spen **c** er plants corn
next to the farmhou **se** . All summer long,
he takes care of the corn. By the end of
the summer, the corn is ripe. Then Mister
Spen **c** er harvests it and sells it. That is how
he makes a living.

Mister Spen **c** er has a garden, too. In his
garden he plants eggplants, beets, sprouts,
and peppers.

When Pepper came to the farm, he gave
the rabbits quite a scare. They were in the
garden, munching on sprouts. Then Pepper
came charging out into the yard, barking.
The rabbits took off! They ra **c** ed back into
their hole as fast as they could.

Pepper ran to the rabbit hole and went in
as far as he could. He started digging with
his paws. But it was no use. It was a deep
hole and he could not get down to where the
rabbits were.

Mister Spen **c** er was sitting in the living
room at the time. He could tell what Pepper
was up to. He smiled. “Good dog!” he said.
“Good dog! I bet those rabbits will munch
on sprouts somewhere el **se** next time!”

## **The Picnic by the River**

Last summer the Spen **c** ers had a picnic by
the river. They had a picnic basket filled with
food. It was stuffed with all sorts of good
things: chicken wings, ham, grapes, chips,
and cupcakes.

Mister Spen **c** er set the picnic basket
down. Gra **c** e and Jill went for a swim in the




_9_


After their swim, the children ra **c** ed
back to the spot where the picnic basket
was. When they got there, there were ants
marching down the side of their picnic
basket. The ants were marching off with
some of the food! The Spen **c** ers had set
their basket down next to the **c** enter of a big
anthill!

“Yikes!” shouted Gra **c** e in a loud voi **ce** .
“Who asked those ants to this picnic?”

Mister Spen **c** er picked up the picnic
basket and brushed off the ants. Much of the
food was in plastic bags, so it was safe from
the ants. Grace and Jill rin **se** d off the grapes
after they brushed off the rest of the ants.



10


_11_


The Spencers sat down and ate their picnic
lunch. This time they sat far from the **c** enter
of the anthill.

After lunch, Mister Spen **c** er asked,
“Should we pack up our stuff and get back to
the farm?”

“Not yet,” said Gra **c** e, and glan **ce** d back
at the anthill.

She smiled and slipped some bits of
cupcake and ham into her pocket. Then she
ran to the anthill. She set the bits of cupcake
and ham on the ground next to the anthill.

“There!” she said. “That will be lunch for
the ants. I think ants are cool when they are
not crawling on our basket!”



12


_13_


## **Ants**

The next week Gra **c** e came running home
after class. “Mom!” she said as she ra **c** ed into
the kitchen. “We got an ant farm for our
classroom! It’s made of plastic so you can see
into it. You can look inside and see what the
ants are up to. You can see them when they
take bits of food back to their nest. It is so
cool because you get a glimp **se** into the lives
of ants.”

Her mom smiled and nodded. She was
glad to see Gra **c** e filled with ex **c** itement.

Gra **c** e went on, “Miss Fran **c** is says that
ants are insects. All insects have six legs. Bees
and termites are insects, too! But they are
not as cool as ants! In fact, some ants can lift
objects that are one hundred times bigger
than them.”



14


_15_


“Cool! What el **se** did Miss Fran **c** is tell
you?” asked her mom.

“Ants have a queen but not a king,” Gra **c** e
said. “The queen is the top ant. She is the
boss. The rest of the ants feed her and take
good care of her.”

“I like the sound of that!” said her mom.

“But it’s a hard life for her,” said Gra **c** e.
“She has to make lots of eggs. So she has to
be deep in the **c** enter of the anthill all the
time.”

Gra **c** e stopped to inhale. Then she asked,
“Mom, can I run out in the yard and look
for ants?”

“Yes, you can,” said her mom. And out
Gra **c** e ran.

## **The Band**

Gra **c** e and Jill are in a band. Gra **c** e toots on
her trumpet. Jill toots on her slide trombone.

When the children started out, they
did not sound too good. Jill and her
trombone sounded like a sick moo **se** . Gra **c** e
and her trumpet sounded like a flock of
gee **se** .

The two of them made quite a racket.

It was so bad that Mister Spen **c** er would
yell, “I can’t take it!” Then he would run out
of the hou **se** and hide in the barn.

But, sin **ce** then, the children have gotten
a lot better, just as Mister Van **ce** said they
would. Mister Van **ce** is the band master.
He spends a lot of time with the children,
helping them get better.



18


_19_


In the spring there is a band con **c** ert in the
park.

Mister Van **ce** gets up on the bandstand
and waves his hands. The band starts
belting out a jazz song. They sound good.
Gra **c** e hits the notes on her trumpet. Jill’s
trombone sounds good, too. The drummer is
drumming up a storm. The band is **kn** ocking
it out of the park.

Mister Van **ce** has a big smile on his face.
He is proud of Gra **c** e and Jill.

Mister Spen **c** er smiles, too. He has gotten

## **The Yard Sale**

Gra **c** e went to a yard sale. There were lots
of things for sale at the yard sale. There were
books and games and shells. There was a long
coil of rope, a **kn** apsack, and a lamp. There
was a rack of pants and dresses. There was a
bin filled with forks, spoons, and **kn** ives for
the kitchen.

Gra **c** e spent some time looking at the
books. She found one that she liked and
one that was perfect for Jill. There was just
one problem. She did not have the cash she
needed to get her book and the one for Jill.
She would have to make a choi **ce** .

Gra **c** e saw that she would have to get just
one of the books. But which one should she
get? She looked at her book. Then she looked
at the book for Jill. In the end, she dropped
her book back in the box.

the man.


the book.

_25_


## **The Storm**

There is a big storm on the farm. Dark
clouds have blocked out the moon and stars.
Thunder booms in the darkness. Gusts of
wind sweep past the barn.

Gra **c** e is in bed with the book she got
at the yard sale. She is not scared of the
thunder. In fact, she likes it. She sleeps better
when there is a storm. But Jill is not as brave
as Gra **c** e.

Just as Gra **c** e is drifting off to sleep, her
sister yells in a scared voi **ce** . Gra **c** e jumps out
of bed and runs into Jill’s room. Jill is sitting
up in bed. She is weeping and grabbing her
legs. She win **c** es when the thunder booms.
Her **kn** ees **kn** ock when the wind gusts.



26


_27_


“What’s the matter, Jill?” Gra **c** e asks,
**kn** eeling next to the bed.

“I’m scared!” says Jill.

Gra **c** e hugs her sister and sits next to her
on the bed. “It’s just a summer storm. We
will be safe inside the hou **se** .”

Her big sister’s words make Jill feel better.
The hug helps, too. But there is still one
thing that has her scared.

“The ducks!” she says. “Will they be safe
out in the storm?”

“Yes,” Gra **c** e says. “Those ducks are smart.
When the thunder booms, they scamper off
and take shelter. They will be just fine.”

Jill smiles and says, “I am glad the ducks
have a safe pla **c** e to run to in the storm. That
makes me feel better!”



28


_29_


## **Dark Clouds and Wind**

The next morning when the Spen **c** ers
wake up, the sun is out. Larks sing in the
treetops. Socks and pants hang on the line.
It seems like the perfect chan **ce** to have a
picnic.

The Spen **c** ers sit down next to the hou **se**
and munch on their lunch. As they finish
up, Mister Spen **c** er glan **c** es up and sees dark
clouds off to the west. The smile on his fa **c** e
fades.




_31_


“It looks like there’s a storm off to the
west,” says Mister Spen **c** er.

The clouds get darker and the wind picks
up.

“I don’t like the look of it,” Mister
Spen **c** er says to his wife. “Let’s pack up
and take the children down into the storm
shelter, just to be safe.”

The Spen **c** ers pick up their picnic things.
They stuff the food in the picnic basket.
Gra **c** e grabs the cups and napkins. They take
the basket down into the storm shelter.



32


_33_


The storm shelter is like a basement. It is a
safe pla **c** e where the Spen **c** ers can take shelter
in a storm.

On **ce** they are down in the shelter, Mister
Spen **c** er starts to lock up the shutters.

“No!” Gra **c** e shouts. “Not yet! Pepper’s
still out there!”

Mister Spen **c** er darts out of the shelter to
get the dog. Soon he is back. He is dripping
wet, but he has Pepper in his arms.



34


_35_


## **In the Storm Shelter**

The Spen **c** ers are down in their storm
shelter. Outside the shelter, the storm has
started. The wind gusts. Thunder cracks and
crashes.

Down in the shelter the Spen **c** ers can’t
tell how bad the storm is. But the Spen **c** ers
will be safe down in their storm shelter.
Their storm shelter can stand up to strong
storms.

When the thunder booms, Jill grabs her
mom’s arm. “I expect it,” she says. “But still,
it scares me!” Her mom hugs her.



36


_37_


When it sounds like the storm is finished,
Mister Spen **c** er peeks out.

“It’s safe,” he says.

The Spen **c** ers step outside. Mister
Spen **c** er checks the barn. It is fine. Gra **c** e
and Jill pick up some pots that were
**kn** ocked off the porch by the wind.

“Things look to be in good shape,” says
Mister Spen **c** er.

“Good!” Mom says. “Let’s sit down and
finish our picnic!”




_39_


## **The Visit**

The Spen **c** ers are on a trip to visit their
Gran. It’s a long car ride from the farm.
Their dad drives in the morning. Then their
mom drives after lunch. Gra **c** e and Jill feel
like the trip will never end.

At last, they get to Gran’s pla **c** e. Gra **c** e and
Jill run up to their Gran and hug her.

“It’s so ni **c** e to see you!” says Gran.

“Gran,” Jill says, “can we run down and
swim?” After the long car ride, the children
need some exer **c** ise.


Gran smiles. She grabs her **kn** apsack and
points to the flip-flops on her feet and says,
“I’m all set!”



40


_41_


Gra **c** e and Jill get dressed for swimming.
They rub sunscreen on their arms and legs.
Mister Spen **c** er helps them rub the sunscreen
on their backs.

On **ce** the sunscreen is on, Gra **c** e and Jill
run down the path to the cove. When they
get there, they wade in, yelping as the cool
waves crash past them.

Gra **c** e and Jill splash and ride the waves.
They dig for crabs and pick up shells. They
toss a Frisbee back and forth. They munch
on snacks and sit in the sun. It’s fun to visit
with Gran.

be the state champs.


asks.

“Yup!” Gra **c** e says.


we bring our A game!”



44


_45_


In the game, Gra **c** e starts off with a run
of bad luck. She keeps missing the net, no
matter how hard she kicks.

One time she takes a shot but the keeper
blocks it. One time she takes a shot but the
shot is off target. One time she shoots but
gets **kn** ocked down and skins her **kn** ee.

“Arg!” Gra **c** e yells. She sits on the grass
and pouts.

“Hang in there!” yells Mister **Kn** ox.

“Get back in the game!” yells her dad.
“A quitter never wins, and a winner never
quits!”



46


_47_


and brushes herself off.

She runs and makes a ni **c** e pass to Kim
**Kn** ox out on the left wing. Kim makes a pass
back to Gra **c** e in the **c** enter.

Gra **c** e has a shot! She swings her leg.
Thwack! This time her shot is strong and on
target. It shoots past the keeper and into the
net.

“Yes!” shouts Mister **Kn** ox.

“Ni **c** e shot!” yells Mister Spen **c** er.

Kim and Jane and the rest of her pals
run up and hug her. Jane lifts her up. **Wh** ile
they are hugging Gra **c** e and jumping up and
down, the horn sounds. Time has run out!
The game is finished. Gra **c** e and her pals are
the state champs!



48


_49_


## **Supper**

Gra **c** e invites two of her pals from soccer
to visit her hou **se** for supper. They are twin
sisters. Their names are Kim and Jane **Kn** ox.

Gra **c** e and her mom spend the morning
cooking. They gather fresh greens from the
garden. They cook two chickens in a big pan.
They bake fresh corn muffins and a cake.

Gra **c** e gets to crack the eggs and mix the
cake. Her mom lets her help **wh** ip up the
frosting, too. And, best of all, she gets to lick
the spoon **wh** en the frosting is finished!

At six a car drives up and toots the horn.
Mister **Kn** ox is at the **wh** eel.

“That’s them!” Gra **c** e shouts. She runs out
to meet her classmates.



50


_51_


They sit down for dinner.

Kim **Kn** ox cuts the chicken with her
**kn** ife. “Yum!” she says. “This chicken is the
best! It’s so much better than the stuff our
dad makes!”

Jane nods. She would tell Gra **c** e how good
the chicken is, but her mouth is stuffed with
chicken.

“Save room for cake!” Gra **c** e says.

After supper Gra **c** e brings in the cake she
and her mom made. She helps her mom slice
up the cake.

“Ooo!” says Kim. “What sort of cake is it!”

“Red velvet!” says Gra **c** e.

“Yum!” says Kim. “Can we visit next
weekend, too?”



52


_53_


54


## **Grace the Performer**

Gra **c** e jumps out of bed and gets dressed.
She slips on striped **kn** ee socks, green pants,
and a green top.

Next Gra **c** e gets out her make-up. She
rubs some **wh** ite make-up on her fa **c** e. Then
she gets out red lipstick for her lips. She slips
on a wig and pins a hat to the wig. The last
thing she adds is a big red nose.

Gra **c** e is getting dressed up to be a mime.
There are lots of fun things to do at the park
this week. Today Gra **c** e will perform for lots
of children. Her job will be to make all the
children in the tent at the park smile. But
she can’t tell jokes. Mimes do not tell jokes.
In fact, mimes do not use words at all. They
have to keep mute at all times. That is **wh** at
makes the job a hard one. But that is **wh** at
makes it fun, too.


_55_


Gra **c** e starts off with a bike trick. She
stacks up a bunch of cups. Then she jumps
them with her bike. The children cheer and
Gra **c** e ho **n** ks her bike horn.

Next Gra **c** e grabs a rose and waves it at the
children in the stands. Oops! It’s a trick rose
with a hose in it. Some of the children get wet!

At the end of her act, Gra **c** e gets up on a
rope. She takes three steps on the rope. Then
she acts like she is slipping. **Wh** oops! Gra **c** e
slips and lands sitting on the ground with a
clu **n** k and a thump. But it is all part of the act.
Grace has a big, soft pad roped to her back.

The children cheer. They like the mime
and her act. Mom, Dad, and Jill are sitting
in the stands, too. They clap and yell the
loudest of all.

Gra **c** e smiles and waves. She thi **n** ks it’s fun
to be a mime and perform!



56


_57_


## **The Frog Jumping Contest**

There is a frog jumping contest at the park
this week, too.

“Did you get a frog for the contest?” Ken
asks. Gra **c** e nods. She sticks her hand in her
bag and grabs her frog. The frog sits on her
fi **n** gers.

“Cool!” Ken says. “What’s his name?”

“It’s a she!” says Gra **c** e. “Her name is
Hopper.”

“I got one, too,” says Ken. “His name is
Legs.” Legs has lo **n** ger legs than Hopper.



58


_59_


Gra **c** e and Ken take their frogs to the
starting line. They set the frogs down. The
starter shouts, “On your mark! Get set!
Hop!”

“Jump!” Ken yells. “Jump!” Legs hops off.

Hopper jumps, too, but she jumps off to
the side.

“No, Hopper!” Gra **c** e yells. She runs and
grabs her frog. Then she sets her down with
her fa **c** e pointing at the finish line.

Hopper hops off. This time she is lined up
and on target.

Ken and Gra **c** e chase their frogs down the
track. The frogs are fast. It is a close ra **c** e.



60


_61_


The two frogs cross the finish line at the
same time.

“Did Legs win?” Ken asks.

“Did Hopper win?” Gra **c** e asks.

“We have two winners!” says the man at
the finish line. “Hopper and Legs crossed
the line at the same time. They will share the
prize!”

The man hands Gra **c** e and Ken a cup for
their prize. Gra **c** e plops Hopper in the cup.
Ken adds Legs. Then they hoist the cup up
and shout, “Here’s to the champs!”



62


_63_


## **The Spinning Wheel**

There are lots of fun rides and games at

the Spinning **Wh** eel. The Spinning **Wh** eel

and round and lift up. It is fun to ride.

“Jill!” Gra **c** e yells as the **wh** eel starts to
spin, “I dare you to keep your hands up
**wh** ile you ride, like this!”

Soon they are **wh** izzing and **wh** ooshing
and shouting and yelling. Gra **c** e keeps her
hands up till the ride ends. Jill keeps her
hands up for a **wh** ile, but not all the time.

“ **Wh** oo-hoo!” shouts Gra **c** e.


pi **n** k with ex **c** itement.



64


_65_


they run and check out the games. Gra **c** e
shoots hoops **wh** ile Jill tosses darts at a
target. Jill wins a prize!

“Let’s have a snack!” says Gra **c** e. The
sisters get a big tub of buttered popcorn.
They share a corn dog and a dri **n** k, too. The
food is good.

**Wh** en they are finished, Jill asks, “Should
we ride the Spinning **Wh** eel one last time?”

“No,” Gra **c** e says. “After all that food, it
would not be safe. I thi **n** k I would get sick!”



66


_67_


## **Buster the Pig**

There are contests at the park, too. Gra **c** e
is at a livestock contest with her dad. **Wh** en
a livestock contest is held, farmers bring their
best sheep and pigs and hope to win a prize.

“Look at the size of that pi **n** k pig!” Gra **c** e
says.

“His name is Buster,” says a teen in a
**wh** ite ta **n** k standing next to the pig. He is
rubbing the pig’s fla **n** k with a rag. “And my
name is Rod.”

“ **Wh** at are you doing to him?” Gra **c** e asks.

“I’m brushing him,” says Rod. “Buster
needs to look his best so he can win the top
prize. Would you like to help?”



68


_69_


**Wh** en it’s time to take Buster out into the
ring, Gra **c** e rubs him under his chin. Buster
likes this so much he oi **n** ks and **wh** impers.

There are lots of pigs in the ring, and they
all look good. A man in a black hat inspects
the pigs. His job is to pick **wh** ich pig he
thi **n** ks is best. That pig will be the winner.

“I hope Buster wins!” Gra **c** e says.

The man looks at the pigs one
last time. Then he points a fi **n** ger
at Buster and hands the top prize




_71_


## **Whisper**

Gra **c** e and Jill like to visit the livestock
contest. There are lots of fun things to do
there.

In one barn, they see a man cutting wool
off a sheep. They feel the wool the man has
cut from the sheep. It is soft. The man tells
them that the wool can be used to **kn** it hats
and scarves and mittens.

Jill gets to milk a cow. She likes to see the
milk shoot out of the udder and splash in the
bucket.

Gra **c** e picks up a rabbit. The rabbit is cute
with lots of fuzz.

Then Gra **c** e sees chicks that have just
hatched out of their eggs! She picks one up
and pets it. She thi **n** ks the chick is the softest
thing she has ever petted.



72


_73_


“Are the chicks for sale?” she asks.

“Yep,” says the man.

“Can I bring this one home?” Gra **c** e asks.
She looks at her mom and dad.

“It’s fine with me,” says her dad. “But you
have to take good care of her.”

“I will, I will!” says Gra **c** e.

Mister Spencer hands the man some cash.
The man plops the chick in a box and hands
Gra **c** e the box.

In the car, Gra **c** e asks, “ **Wh** at should I
name her?”

“Snickers!” says Jill.

“ **Wh** izbang!” says Mom.

“Gem!” says Dad.

“No,” says Grace. “I will name her
**Wh** isper!”



74


_75_


him bring in the harvest.



76


_77_


**Wh** en they are finished with the harvest,
Ha **n** k spots **wh** at looks like a rock sticking
up out of the ground. He bends down and
grabs it.

“ **Wh** at is it?” **C** edric asks.

“I thi **n** k it’s a chu **n** k of a pot,” says Ha **n** k.
He dusts it off with his fi **n** gers and says, “It
could be a relic from a long time back in the
past!”

Back at the hou **se**, Ha **n** k hands the pot
shard to Gra **c** e. “Here,” he says. “This is for
you. We can’t tell, but we thi **n** k it could be a
relic.”

“Tha **n** ks!” says Gra **c** e, with a smile. Then
she runs to get Ha **n** k and **C** edric some corn
muffins. They sit on the steps and munch on
the muffins.



78


_79_


## **The Harvest Marvel**

After the harvest, the Spen **c** ers had a
Harvest Fest on their farm. A bunch of
children came.

“Have fun!” Mister Spen **c** er said to the
children. “And look out for the Harvest
Marvel!”

“What’s the Harvest Marvel?” one of the
children asked.

“There is a legend that farmers have passed
down for a long time. At the Harvest Fest,
someone dresses as the Harvest Marvel to
celebrate all of the crops and good food we
harvest in the fall. Looking out for the Harvest
Marvel can be the best game at the Harvest
Fest!” said Mister Spen **c** er.



80


_81_


Marvel was.



82


_83_


Marvel, too. But then she spotted a jacket on
the Harvest Marvel, under the corn husks.
She recognized that jacket.

Gra **c** e ran up to the Harvest Marvel and
tagged it. By ac **c** ident, she **kn** ocked the
pumpkin mask off of the Harvest Marvel.

“See!” Gra **c** e yelled. “It’s just Ha **n** k!”

**Wh** en the children saw that the Harvest
Marvel was just Ha **n** k, they ran up and
jumped on top of him. Ha **n** k and the
children were all smiles.

## **The Jumping Fish**

Today Gra **c** e and Jill are at the lake with
their mom. They are bump-bump-bumping
on top of the waves.

Gra **c** e can feel the wind on her face. It is
so strong it makes her bli **n** k and squint.

“Look!” Gra **c** e says. She points at a big
green fish that has jumped up next to them.
The fish twists. Then it flops back into the

“Snakes make their home in dark holes in
the ground. But they like the sun, too. **Wh** en
the sun is out, snakes like to coil up on rocks
and let the sun shine on them.

“Snakes do not order a sandwich for
lunch. They do not like sweets or nuts or
chips. They are hunters. They hunt for

It will not need food for the rest of the week.

“Snakes are fun, but if you see one, take
care. It’s not safe to grab a snake, or to get
too close to one. Snakes have sharp fangs and
they can bite you!”

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with this program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully leveled
in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.


The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many spellings
can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to make early
reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of the available
spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out as part of their
phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been deliberately
introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if they are
assigned at the proper time.


As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.
