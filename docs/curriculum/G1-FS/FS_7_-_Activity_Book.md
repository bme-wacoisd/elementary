**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 7. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. The activity pages in this book do
not always include written instructions for students because the instructions would have words
that are not decodable. Teachers will explain these activity pages to the students orally, using the
instructions in the Teacher Guide. The Activity Book is a student component, which means each
student should have an Activity Book.

**The Red Dish**


The next d **ay**, J **ay** has dinner with Martez
and his mom and dad. Martez’s mom and dad
were born in Mexico, but they are proud to be
Americans now.

They have a Mexican dish with peppers, corn,
and rice all mixed up. There are two dishes of it
sitting side by side. One dish is red. One is green.

“Are the two dishes the same?” J **ay** asks.

“Nope,” says Martez with a smile. “The stuff
in the red dish has lots of hot peppers. The stuff
in the green dish has just green peppers, which
are not as hot.”

Martez points at his dad and says, “My dad
likes hot peppers.”

His dad smiles and nods.

Martez asks J **ay**, “Do you like hot peppers?”

J **ay** shrugs. He has never had hot peppers.

J **ay** has some food from the green dish. He likes it a lot. He says,
“Could I have some from the red dish?”

“You can, but it’s hot, hot, hot!” says Martez. “We have a s **ay** ing in our
house: _He is a brave man who has food from Dad’s red dish!”_


“Brave or perhaps foolish!” says his mom.

J **ay** is brave—or perhaps foolish. He takes a bite of the peppers from
the red dish. Martez looks at him. His mom and dad look, too.

“Do you like it?” asks Martez.

J **ay** ’s face starts to get red. He yells,
“Hot!”

His face gets redder and redder.

Martez sees that J **ay** is in p **ai** n. He brings
his ice cubes. J **ay** stuffs some in his mouth
and lets them melt. The ice cubes help cool
down his mouth.

“Ug!” J **ay** says, sitting back from his plate.
“Those peppers in the red dish are too hot for
me! I need to stick to the green dish.”

“Still,” Martez says, “tod **ay** you joined the club.”

“What club?”

“The I-ate-from-Dad’s-red-dish-and-am-still-living-to-tell-the-tale
club!” says Martez.

Martez and his mom and dad all smile. They like J **ay** .

**A House in the Clouds**


Mister Gomez drives all of them to the next place. In the car, Mister
Gomez s **ay** s, “Can I offer you a snack? This is a paleta.”


J **ay** and Martez like the paletas. J **ay** s **ay** s, “This is good! I love the taste!”


Martez s **ay** s, “This tastes like an ice pop.”


Mister Gomez explains that a paleta
is a Mexican snack that can be made
fresh with different foods like mango
and banana. It can also have sweet milk
in it. He tells them that paleta means
“little stick.” Mister Gomez s **ay** s that
kids in Mexico have liked the snack for
a long time.


In the car, they pass trees, hills, and
streets on their trip. Mister Gomez
s **ay** s, “You will like this next place. The
stones there have stood for much, much
longer than the last stones.”

When they get to the site, they see three vast piles of stone, all of

the top of it. “Goodness!” J **ay** ’s mom s **ay** s.


“Cool!” s **ay** s Martez.


“Was this an important place for the Aztecs?” J **ay** ’s mom asks.


“Yes,” s **ay** s Mister Gomez. “The pyramids were made w **ay** back in
the past. They were important to the Aztecs. They used the pyramids for
different things.”


“Can we go to the top of one of them?” J **ay** asks.


“No, you can’t go up there anymore,” Mister Gomez s **ay** s. “They
want to keep this place safe so that it can last for a long time.”


J **ay** and Martez look all the way up to the top. J **ay** s **ay** s, “The
pyramid is so tall it could touch the clouds.”


Martez says, “Maybe a long time ago they called it a house in the clouds!”

“Shark will not get us in here!” one of the fish said. 53
“He is too big to swim in.” 60
After a while, one of the fish went out to check and 71
see if Shark had left. His name was Wee Fish. 82
Wee Fish swam out of the cave. He soon found 92
himself face to face with Shark. 98
Shark snarled, “Here’s a nice fish for my lunch!” 107

Wee Fish had to think fast. 113
“Stop!” he shouted in his loudest voice. “I am the 123
king of this reef! All of the fish here are scared of me, 136
and you should be, too!” 141
Shark smiled. Wee Fish was just three inches long. 150
Shark was ten feet long. He had teeth in his mouth 161
that were bigger than Wee Fish. 167

“Is this some sort of joke?” Shark said. “Why

182
would fish be scared of you?”


193
“Swim next to me and you will see,” Wee Fish said.


202
Shark swam with Wee Fish. They came upon some

211
spotted fish. When the spotted fish saw Shark, they

216
got scared and swam off.


226
Shark and Wee Fish swam up to some striped fish.

236
When the striped fish saw Shark, they got scared and

238
swam off.


248
“Well, well,” said Shark to himself. “It’s odd, but it

260
looks like the fish are scared of Wee Fish, just as he
said.” (Shark did not see that the fish were scared of 271

272
him.)

Shark and Wee Fish swam up to some silver fish. 282

292
When the silver fish saw Shark, they got scared and

294
swam off.


304
Then Shark started to think. “All of the fish are

314
scared of Wee Fish,” he said to himself. “Perhaps I

320
should be scared of him, too.”


330
All of a sudden, Shark felt scared. He swam off.

341
And from then on, he never went back to that reef.
