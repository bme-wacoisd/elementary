**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the
Teacher Guide for Unit 3. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the
lesson number and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there
are two activity pages for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. The activity pages in this book do not always include written instructions for students because the
instructions would have words that are not decodable. Teachers will explain these activity
pages to the students orally, using the instructions in the Teacher Guide. The Activity Book is
a student component, which means each student should have an Activity Book.

Dear Family Member,


##### 1.4



**Take-Home**



Today we started Unit 3 of English Language Arts. Starting with this unit, your student will
receive a new list of spelling words each Monday. The purpose of having weekly spelling
words is to help students become strong spellers and allow them to practice at home the
skills they have learned. Your student will receive the spelling words at the beginning of the
week and will be tested on the words at the end of the week.


There are eight words each week. The words cover only the spellings that have been reviewed and taught in class, meaning that your student will only work with and be tested
on familiar spellings. The last spelling word is shaded in gray to indicate it is a Tricky Word.
Tricky Words do not follow the expected spelling rules, so they cannot be reliably sounded
out and spelled, which means their spellings must be memorized. Tricky Words are also
taught and reviewed in class.


I encourage you to work with your student each night to review the spelling words for 5–10
minutes. The activities can be fun but should involve having your student write the word,
not just spelling it aloud.


Here are a few activity ideas:


   - Say a sentence with the spelling word, but leave the spelling word out. Your student
should guess which of the week’s spelling words should complete the sentence and
then write the word down.


   - Create spelling word flash cards. After reading the word on a flash card, your student
can turn over the card and write the word from memory on another piece of paper.


   - Have a spelling bee at home, asking your student to both spell the words to you
orally and write them.


   - Ask your student to write each word in a short sentence or write a story with the
words.


   - If possible, act out or draw a picture of the words; have your student guess the word
and then write it down.


   - Please have your student practice spelling the words in a different order each night;
do not simply call them out in the order listed.


   - Starting later this week, your student will also bring home a story that we have read
in class. The story for this week is called “The King Frog and the Big Ox.” Please have
your student read the story to you and then talk about it together.


If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

“The King Frog is not here. Where did he go?”


“A big ox came,” said all the frogs. “He made a

They said, “When he came, he hit the King
Frog with one of his big feet.


“Was he big?” said the small frog. He made a
big puff to s **ee** m like the big ox.
“Was the ox as big as this?” said the small frog.

The ox came from the cool pool. His big sips
came to a stop. He sat on the green grass to
rest his big, wet feet.


The King Frog sat up from the mud in the cool
pool. He said, “That ox was this big!”
He gave a puff, puff,

like the big ox.


With a POP, King

**The Two Dogs**


Once two dogs met. One of them was a tame
dog who made his home with men. One was
a dog who ran free.


The dog who ran free stared at the tame dog
and said, “Why is it that you are so plump and
I am so thin?”


“Well,” said the tame dog,
“I am plump because the
men feed me. I do not
have to run all the time to
get my f **oo** d. My job is to
keep the home safe when
the men are in their beds.

When they wake up, they feed me scraps of
f **oo** d from their plates.”


“Your life must be a fine life,” said the thin dog.
“I wish my life were like yours.”


The plump dog said, “If you will help me keep
the home safe, I bet the men will feed
you, t **oo** .”


“I will do it!” said the thin dog.


But just as the thin dog said this, the m **oo** n
shone on the neck of the plump dog.


The thin dog said, “What is that on your neck?”


“I am on a rope when the sun is up,” said the
plump dog.


“Rope?” said the thin dog. “Do they keep you
on a rope?”

“Yes,” said the plump dog. “When the m **oo** n

shines, they keep me on a rope. I can not run
and be free when the sun is up, but it is not
so bad.”


“No, no!” said the thin dog, as he ran off. “I
will not have a rope on my neck. You can be
plump. I will be free!”

This week during our language arts time, we will continue to explore the writing process with
students. We are teaching students to plan, draft, and edit written compositions before creating a final product. Ask your student to explain the process to you.

We will also continue to read stories from the reader _Fables_ . Your student can explain the different morals from the stories we read in class.

Included below are the spelling words for this week. Remember to encourage your student to
practice these words each night in order to be prepared for the test at the end of the week.

Your student has been taught to read words with the vowel sounds /oo/ as in _soon_ and /oo/
as in _look_ . Reading words like these is tricky because the two vowel sounds are spelled with
the exact same spelling, ‘oo,’ but pronounced differently. Ask your student to cut out the word
cards. Show the cards to your student and have your student read them. You may also ask your
student to copy the words onto a sheet of paper. Your student can sort the word cards into two
piles: one pile for words with /oo/ as in _soon_ and one pile for words with /oo/ as in _look_ . Please
keep and use the cards for future practice.

For Unit 3 of our English Language Arts program, your student has been taught to read the
Tricky Words _should_, _could_, _would_, _because_, and _down_ . Tricky Words are hard to read because
they contain parts that are not pronounced the way one would expect. For this reason, students must memorize the word.

Have your student read the Tricky Words in the box and then the sentences below. Note that
the tricky parts are underlined. Have your student write the matching Tricky Word for each
sentence and write it on the line. Please note that there could be different answers for the sentences. Ask your student to read the completed sentence out loud, and ask if it makes sense.
You may ask your student if there is another word that could fit in the sentence as well.

**The Fox and the Hen**

A hen sat in a tree. A red fox ran up to
the tree.


“Did they tell you?” said the fox.


“Tell me what?” said the hen.


“They have made a l **aw**,”
said the fox. The l **aw** says
that we must all be pals.
Dogs are not to chase cats.
They must be pals. Cats are
not to chase rats. They must
be pals. Dog and cat, fox
and hen, snake and rat must all be pals! So
jump down here and let me hug you!”

“Well, that s **ou** nds swell!” said the hen. “But, all

Then the hen said, “What’s that I see?”


“Where?” said the fox. “What is it?”


“It looks like a pack of dogs,” said the hen.


“Dogs!” said the fox. “Then I must get **ou** t
of here!”


“Stop!” said the hen.
“The l **aw** says that
dog and fox must be
pals. So you are safe!”


But the fox did not
stop. He ran off.


The hen just smiled.

you have lunch with me?”


The crane said, “I will.”

down with the fox in

smiled at his trick. He ate up all of his f **oo** d.
