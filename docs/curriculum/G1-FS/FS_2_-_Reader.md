“Was the trip fun?” Josh asks.


“Which one?” Gran asks. “I
went on thr **ee** trips!”


“Where to?” asks Josh.


“One was to the Swiss Alps,”
says Gran. “In the Alps, there
were st **ee** p cliffs. I went up to the
top of one cliff, but it was slick. I
fell and had to cling to the rocks!”


“No!” says Jen.


“Yes!” says Gran. “Here is a snap
shot.”

“What was the next trip?” Josh
asks.


“I went to Hong Kong,” says
Gran.


“What is in Hong Kong?”


“Lots of stuff,” says Gran. “Hong
Kong has lots of ships and big
lamps.”


“No!” says Josh.


“Yes!” says Gran. “Here is a
snap shot.”

“What was the last trip?” asks
Jen.


“I went to the gulf to swim with
the **ee** ls and f **ee** d the fish,” says
Gran.


“No!” says Jen.

“Which trip was the best?” Josh

“This one!” Gran says. “The one
where I get to s **ee** Josh and Jen!”

# **The Pet**

Gran says, “When I was on my
trip, I got a pet.”


“What can it be?” asks Jen. “Is it
a fish?”


“No,” says Gran.


“Is it a dog?” asks Josh.


“No,” says Gran.



10


11


“Is this pet big?” asks Josh.


“Well,” says Gran, “he is not big,
but he is long.”


“Has he got t **ee** th?” asks Josh.


“He has fangs!” says Gran.


“What are fangs?” asks Jen.


Just then, the bell rings.


Gran says, “That must be him!”



12


13


# **King**

Jen yells, “Gran, there is a man
here with a big cr **a** t **e** .”


Gran says, “It must be King!”


“Who?” asks Jen.


“The pet I got on my trip,”
says Gran.


“But what is this King?” asks
Josh.



14


15


Gran t **a** k **e** s the lid off the cr **a** t **e**
and lifts up a long, black sn **a** k **e** .


“Sw **ee** t!” says Josh. “King is a
sn **a** k **e** !”


“ **Ee** k!” Jen yells. “I am sc **a** r **e** d of
sn **a** k **e** s!”


Gran says, “King is a s **a** f **e** sn **a** k **e** .
There are sn **a** k **e** s that can kill us,
but King is not one of them. This is
a sn **a** k **e** we can pet.”



16


17


# **Where Is King?**

“Help!” Gran yells.


“What is it?” says Jen.


“King is not in his cr **a** t **e** !” says
Gran. “Where is he?”



18


19


Jen checks the pots and pans.


“He is not in here!” she yells.
“Check in the den.”



20


21


Josh checks the den.


“He is not in here,” he yells. “I
bet he went back to the pet shop!”



22


23


Just then, King p **ee** ks up from
a big v **a** s **e** .


“There he is!” says Josh.


Gran runs to King and picks
him up. She pets the sn **a** k **e** . She is
glad to s **ee** him.

# **The Swim Meet**

Josh and Jen l **i** k **e** to swim. They

Jen l **i** n **e** s up in l **a** n **e** f **i** v **e** .


Josh l **i** n **e** s up in l **a** n **e** six.


The kids are up on the blocks.


Then there is a b **ee** p.


All the kids d **i** v **e** in. Splash!


“Swim!” yells Gran. “Swim fast!”



26


27


Josh and Jen swim as fast as
they can. They swim and swim. In
no t **i** m **e**, they m **a** k **e** it to the end.


“Did Josh win?” asks Gran. “Did
Jen win?”


Josh and Jen w **a** v **e** and sm **i** l **e** .
They did not win, but they had a
lot of fun!



28

# **At the Reef**

Josh asks Gran what it was l **i** k **e**
when she went to the r **ee** f.


“Well,” Gran says, “it was a lot
of fun! I m **a** d **e** a plan to m **ee** t my
pal M **i** k **e** . I had to r **i** d **e** my b **i** k **e**
n **i** n **e** m **i** l **e** s to the r **ee** f to m **ee** t
M **i** k **e** .”


“That is a long r **i** d **e** !” says Jen.



30


31


“When I got there I went on a
d **i** v **e** to s **ee** the fish and the **ee** ls.”


“With M **i** k **e** ?” Josh asks.


“No,” Gran says. “M **i** k **e** did not
d **i** v **e** with me. He went to hang
gl **i** d **e** .”


“Did he l **i** k **e** it?” Jen asks.


“Not so much,” Gran says with a
sm **i** l **e** .


“Why not?” asks Josh. “It must
be lots of fun to hang gl **i** d **e** .”



32


33


“Did he crash?” asks Jen.


“No, no,” says Gran, “but he did
have a bad t **i** m **e** . When it was t **i** m **e**
to land, he hit a h **i** v **e** of b **ee** s! He
got stung ten t **i** m **e** s.”


“Y **i** k **e** s!” says Jen.



34


35


# **The Bug Glass**

‘‘Gran,’’ Jen says, ‘‘Josh is mad
at me.’’


‘‘Why is he mad?’’ Gran asks.


‘‘I br **o** k **e** his bug glass.’’


‘‘What is a bug glass?’’


‘‘A bug glass is something that
lets him s **ee** bugs and ants up
cl **o** s **e** .’’



36


37


Gran checks the bug glass.


“It is not so bad,” she says. “We
can fix it with some t **a** p **e** .”


“Josh will still be mad,” Jen says.


“We can m **a** k **e** him a snack,”
says Gran. “And we can m **a** k **e** the
ants a snack, as well.”


Gran hands Jen some chips
and gr **a** p **e** s. “Here,” she says, “Set
th **o** s **e** on the big st **o** n **e** in back.”



38


39


Gran yells, ‘‘Snack t **i** m **e** !’’


Josh runs in and grabs a snack.
Gran lets him munch on it. Then
she says, ‘‘Jen, t **a** k **e** Josh to the
st **o** n **e** .’’


Jen grabs Josh by the hand
and t **a** k **e** s him to the st **o** n **e** . He
s **ee** s his bug glass. Then he s **ee** s
a bunch of ants. He picks up the
glass and st **a** r **e** s at the ants.


Josh sm **i** l **e** s. ‘‘The ants l **i** k **e** th **o** s **e**
chips!’’ he says. He hands Jen the
glass. ‘‘Here!’’ he says, ‘‘T **a** k **e** a
p **ee** k!’’



40


41


# **The Tape**

“Gran,” Jen asks, “what is that?”


“This is a t **a** p **e** deck,” Gran says.
“And in it is a t **a** p **e** with some songs
sung by my gran.”


On the t **a** p **e** Gran’s gran sings
a jazz song. At the end she sings
“Pip! Pip! Ting a ling a ling!”


“I l **i** k **e** th **o** s **e** n **o** t **e** s she sings at
the end!” says Jen.


“So do I!” says Gran.



42


43


“Gran,” says Jen, ”we can act
l **i** k **e** we are in the band and sing
the song!”


“OK,” says Gran. “Run and get
a dress. I will grab th **o** s **e** sh **a** d **e** s I
l **i** k **e** .”


Gran and Jen dress up. Then
they sing the song. At the end they
sing, “Pip, pip! Ting a ling a ling!”



44


45


# **Fuzz and Mel**

The kids are in bed, but they
can not sl **ee** p.


“Gran!” Josh yells.


Gran p **ee** ks in and asks, “What
is it?”


“We can not sl **ee** p!” says Josh.
“We can not sl **ee** p.”


“Tell us a t **a** l **e** !” says Jen.


“OK,” says Gran. “This is the t **a** l **e**
of Fuzz and Mel.”



46


47


Once there were two cats
n **a** m **e** d Fuzz and Mel.


Fuzz was a c **u** t **e** cat who did
his best to be s **a** f **e** at all t **i** m **e** s. Me
was a br **a** v **e** cat who had a fast
pl **a** n **e** .



l



“Fuzz!” Mel said, “We can t **a** k **e** a
r **i** d **e** in my pl **a** n **e** !”


“Um,” Fuzz said, “well . . . the
thing
is . . . I l **i** k **e** to be s **a** f **e** . . . and I am
not . . .”


“It is s **a** f **e**,” Mel said. “Jump in!”



48


49


The pl **a** n **e** went up, up, up.


A duck c **a** m **e** up next to the
pl **a** n **e** .


“What a swell duck!” said Fuzz.
“And what a swell pl **a** n **e** r **i** d **e** !
Why was I so sc **a** r **e** d of a pl **a** n **e**
r **i** d **e** ?”



50


51


Just then, Mel m **a** d **e** the
pl **a** n **e** zip from s **i** d **e** to s **i** d **e** .


Fuzz did not l **i** k **e** that. It did
not f **ee** l s **a** f **e** to him.


Then Mel m **a** d **e** the pl **a** n **e**
d **i** v **e** .


‘‘ZZZZZZZZZZZZ!’’ went pl **a** n **e**
as it d **o** v **e** .


‘‘Stop!’’ said Fuzz, as he held
on to the s **i** d **e** of the pl **a** n **e** .
‘‘Not s **a** f **e** ! Not s **a** f **e** !’’



52


53


Mel set the pl **a** n **e** back on the
land.


Fuzz felt sick. He had the
sh **a** k **e** s.


“Ug,” he said. “That’s the last
t **i** m **e** I r **i** d **e** in a pl **a** n **e** with Mel.”



54


55


# **The Sweet Shop**

“Gran,” Josh asks, “did you have
a job when you were a kid?”


“I did,” says Gran. “My dad had
a sw **ee** t shop and I had a job in
the shop.”


“Did you get to m **a** k **e** sw **ee** ts?”


“Yes,” says Gran. “I got to m **a** k **e**
milk sh **a** k **e** s, c **a** k **e** s, and gum drops.”



56


57


“Was it fun?” Josh asks.


“Some of it was fun,” says Gran.
“But it was not all fun and g **a** m **e** s.
I had to sw **ee** p and pick up. And I
had to w **i** p **e** off the c **a** k **e** c **a** s **e** .”


“Can you still m **a** k **e** c **a** k **e** s?” asks
Jen.


“You bet I can!” says Gran. “Do
you want to m **a** k **e** one?”



58


59


# **King and Queen**

“Gran,” Josh says, “will you tell
us a t **a** l **e** ?”


“Yes!” says Jen. “Tell the one
where you had to sc **a** r **e** off the
mad hog!”


“No!” says Josh. “Tell the one
where you were on that ship in the
wind and w **a** v **e** s!”


“I will tell you a t **a** l **e** I m **a** d **e** up,”
says Gran. “This is a t **a** l **e** of a king
and his qu **ee** n.”



60


61


Once there was a qu **ee** n who
felt sad. All she did was sulk and
m **o** p **e** .


The king felt sad that his w **i** f **e**
was so sad. He m **a** d **e** eggs to
ch **ee** r up the qu **ee** n. But the
qu **ee** n said the eggs had a bad
smell.



62


63


The king m **a** d **e** a c **a** k **e** . But the
qu **ee** n did not l **i** k **e** it.


The king m **a** d **e** gum drops. But
the qu **ee** n did not l **i** k **e** them.


By this t **i** m **e**, the king was not
sad. He was mad. He went back
to the st **o** v **e** and m **a** d **e** a pot of
gr **ee** n slop.



64


65


‘‘There!’’ the king said. ‘‘This slop
is not fit to f **ee** d to pigs! The qu **ee** n
will h **a** t **e** it. But so what?”


The king p **i** l **e** d some slop on a
pl **a** t **e** . Then he g **a** v **e** the pl **a** t **e** to
the qu **ee** n.


The qu **ee** n had a b **i** t **e** .


‘‘Mmmm!’’ she said. ‘‘This is the
best!’’



66


67


“Did she l **i** k **e** the gr **ee** n slop?”
Jen asks.


“Yep!” says Gran.


“That was an odd t **a** l **e** !” says
Jen.


“Odd but fun!” says Josh.


Gran tucks the kids in. Then
Josh and Jen drift off to sl **ee** p.



68


69


# **The Trip West**

‘‘I have m **a** d **e** plans to t **a** k **e** a
trip,’’ says Gran. ‘‘My pal Tex has a
ranch in the West. It will be a lot
of fun!’’


Gran sm **i** l **e** s, but Josh and Jen
are sad.


‘‘We will miss you!’’ says Jen.


‘‘What will we do here?’’ says
Josh.



70


71


‘‘Well,’’ says Gran, ‘‘What if you
kids c **a** m **e** on the trip with me?
Your mom and dad said I can t **a** k **e**
you with me.”


‘‘Yes!’’ the kids yell. ‘‘T **a** k **e** us with
you! T **a** k **e** us with you!’’


Josh and Jen pack their bags.
They get in a cab with Gran. Then
they get on a pl **a** n **e** .



72


73


‘‘Will we be s **a** f **e** on this pl **a** n **e** ?’’
Jen asks.


‘‘Yes,’’ says Gran. ‘‘This will be a
s **a** f **e** pl **a** n **e** r **i** d **e**, not l **i** k **e** the one
Fuzz had with Mel.’’


When the pl **a** n **e** lands, Gran
rents a van and dr **i** v **e** s the kids to
the ranch.


Tex is there to gr **ee** t them. He
is a big man with a big hat. He
sh **a** k **e** s hands with Josh and Jen.
Then he hugs Gran.



74


75


At the ranch there is a m **u** l **e**
with packs on his back and bells on
his neck.


“That is Sam,” says Tex. “He has
all the camp stuff in his pack.”


“Will we get to camp?” asks Jen.


Tex nods. “Yup. He has your tent
on his back!”


Josh and Jen run to Sam. They
pet the m **u** l **e** . Sam sh **a** k **e** s and his
bells ring.


The kids sm **i** l **e** .



76


77


# **Saved by the Bells**

Josh, Jen, and Gran h **i** k **e** off to
the camp s **i** t **e** with Sam the m **u** l **e** .


“I will m **ee** t you there!” Tex yells.


When they get to the camp s **i** t **e**,
Josh hangs Sam’s r **o** p **e** on a tr **ee** .


The camp s **i** t **e** is cl **o** s **e** to a c **a** v **e** .
Gran and the kids p **ee** k in the
c **a** v **e** .


Drip. Drip. The c **a** v **e** is damp
and dim. No sun sh **i** n **e** s in the c **a** v **e** .



78


79


Josh, Jen, and Gran h **i** k **e**
d **ee** p in the c **a** v **e** . They get lost.
They are a bit sc **a** r **e** d, but just
then Sam’s bells ring.


Sam’s bells help them get back
to the camp s **i** t **e** .


When they get back, Jen
hugs the m **u** l **e** and says, “Sam,
you and your bells s **a** v **e** d us!”



80


81


# **Splash Dogs**

Tex t **a** k **e** s Gran and the kids to
m **ee** t his dogs, Buck and Pup. Buck is
a big black dog. Pup is just a pup.


“We can t **a** k **e** them to the l **a** k **e** so
you can s **ee** their tricks,” says Tex.


At the l **a** k **e**, Tex grabs a stick.
“Here, Buck!” he yells.


Tex chucks the stick in the l **a** k **e** .
Buck runs to the end of the dock
and jumps. Splash! Buck swims to
the stick and brings it back.



82


83


“Can Pup jump?” Jen asks.


“Well,” Tex says, “he can swim,
but he has not m **a** d **e** a jump yet.
Let us s **ee** if we can get him to
jump.”


Tex t **a** k **e** s a stick and chucks it
on the land. Pup runs and gets it.
Tex pats him on the back.


Next, Tex t **a** k **e** s a stick and
chucks it in the l **a** k **e** . The dogs run
off, but Pup skids to a stop at the
end of the dock. Buck jumps in
and gets the stick.



84


85


“This t **i** m **e**,” Tex says, “k **ee** p a
hand on Buck and s **ee** if Pup will
jump.”


Gran grabs Buck and hugs him.
Tex chucks the stick in the l **a** k **e** . This
t **i** m **e**, Pup runs and m **a** k **e** s the jump.
Splash!


Josh and Jen ch **ee** r and clap.


Pup pops up and swims back to
the land. But what has he got in his
t **ee** th?


“Is that the stick?” Josh asks.


“No!” yells Jen. “Pup has a fish!”



86


87


# **Tex and Rex**

Josh and Jen s **ee** a man in the
den. The man has a black hat.


“Tex!” says Jen.


The kids sm **i** l **e** and w **a** v **e** . The
man w **a** v **e** s back.


“We were at the cr **ee** k!” Jen
yells. The man just sm **i** l **e** s.


“There were d **ee** r tracks at the
cr **ee** k!” Josh yells. The man nods,
but then he runs off.



88


89


“Gran,” Jen asks, “is Tex mad at
us?”


“Mad?” Gran asks. “Why?”


“He s **ee** ms odd,” says Jen. “I
said we went to the cr **ee** k and he
just sm **i** l **e** d.”


“And I said there were d **ee** r
tracks at the cr **ee** k and all he did
was nod,” says Josh.


“It was Tex, but he did not act
l **i** k **e** Tex,” says Jen.



90


91


Just then, Gran grins. “We n **ee** d
to t **a** k **e** a trip to the shed,” she says.


When Gran and the kids get to
the shed, they s **ee** Tex. Then they
s **ee** the man in the black hat.


Jen st **a** r **e** s at Tex and says, “If
you are Tex, then who is that?”


“Kids,” says Gran with a big sm **i** l **e**,
“m **ee** t Rex. Rex and Tex are twins!”



92


93


# **Gran’s Mud Run**

Gran, Tex, and the kids are at a
track. Gran is all set to dr **i** v **e** in a
Mud Run. Thr **ee** trucks are l **i** n **e** d up
s **i** d **e** by s **i** d **e** .


A man w **a** v **e** s a flag and the
trucks t **a** k **e** off.


Gran is fast. She dr **i** v **e** s past the
red truck and the black truck. She
spins the t **i** r **e** s and slings lots of mud
on the black truck. Splat!


Josh and Jen ch **ee** r.



94


95


Gran dr **i** v **e** s f **i** v **e** laps. Then she
gets stuck in d **ee** p mud.


The red truck sp **ee** ds by. Then the
black one zips past. Gran rocks the
truck. It hops from the trench.


Gran steps on the gas. With thr **ee**
laps left, she zips past the black truck.


With one lap left, Gran is just in
back of the red truck. The red truck
slings lots of mud on Gran’s truck.
Gran can not s **ee** much, but she
steps on the gas.



96


97


The red truck and Gran’s gr **ee** n
truck cross the l **i** n **e** s **i** d **e** by s **i** d **e** .


Gran hops from the truck and
yells, “Did I win?”


“Yes!” the kids yell.


Gran w **i** p **e** s off some mud and
asks, “What is my pr **i** z **e** ?”


A man runs up with the pr **i** z **e** . He
hands Gran a t **i** r **e** brush, a big box
of rags, and some truck wax.


“Just what I n **ee** d!” says Gran.



98


99


# **Gran’s Trip Home**

Gran hugs Josh and Jen.


“Tex will t **a** k **e** you kids back in
his truck,” she says.


“Will you t **a** k **e** a bus?” Jen
asks.


“N **o** p **e**,” says Gran.


Gran w **a** v **e** s a map. “This will
get me h **o** m **e**,” she says.



100


101


“S **ee** here?” she says. “We are
here. I will r **i** d **e** my b **i** k **e** to Thr **ee**
M **i** l **e** Gulch, which is here on my
map. It will t **a** k **e** me a w **ee** k to get
there.”


“A w **ee** k!” says Josh.


Gran nods.


“I will **u** s **e** my r **o** p **e** to cross the
gulch,” Gran says. “Then I will h **i** k **e**
up to P **i** n **e** Hill. It’s just n **i** n **e** m **i** l **e** s.”


“N **i** n **e** m **i** l **e** s!” says Josh.



102


103


“Then I will be cl **o** s **e** to h **o** m **e**,”
says Gran. “It is just ten m **i** l **e** s
from P **i** n **e** Hill to my h **o** m **e** .”


“Ten m **i** l **e** s!” says Jen.


“You kids have got one heck of
a gran!” says Tex.


As Gran sets off, the kids w **a** v **e** .


Gran w **a** v **e** s back. “S **ee** you in
back at h **o** m **e** !” she yells.

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully
leveled in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.

The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many spellings
can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to make early
reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of the available
spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out as part of their
phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been deliberately
introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if they are
assigned at the proper time.

As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.
