**Grade 1 | Foundational Skills 2**
Introduction


~~**UNIT 2 OVERVIEW**~~


**Sound/Spelling Correspondences**


In Unit 2, you will introduce five new vowel sounds and the most common (or least ambiguous)
spelling for each sound:


  - /ee/ spelled ‘ee’ as in _seed_


  - /ae/ spelled ‘a_e’ as in _cake_


  - /ie/ spelled ‘i_e’ as in _line_


  - /oe/ spelled ‘o_e’ as in _hope_


  - /ue/ spelled ‘u_e’ as in _cube_


The digraph ‘ee’ and the separated digraphs were taught in Unit 10 of the Kindergarten curriculum,
so some or all of this may be review for students.


~~**SEPARATED DIGRAPHS**~~


The ‘ee’ spelling for /ee/ is a vowel digraph similar to the consonant digraphs students have already
learned (‘ch’, ‘sh’, ‘ng’, etc.). The spellings for the sounds /ae/, /ie/, /oe/, and /ue/ are also digraphs,
but they are digraphs of a different sort. In this program, these are called _separated digraphs_ . The
two letters are still working together (as a letter team) to stand for a single sound, but the letters are
separated from each other by another spelling. The intervening spelling will always be a consonant
spelling, and it will generally be a single-letter spelling as in _sa_ **m** _e_, _wi_ **d** _e_, _to_ **n** _e_, and _cu_ **t** _e_ . There are a
few words in English in which a consonant digraph stands between the two parts of the separated
vowel digraph: _a_ **ch** _e_ is one example. These are not taught in Grade 1.


~~**STRATEGY FOR READING SEPARATED DIGRAPHS**~~


Reading separated digraphs involves a significant departure from the left-to-right letter-sound
decoding students have employed up to this point. Students have been taught to read from left to
right, but in order to read words with separated digraphs, they need to begin scanning to the right
and then glancing back again to the left.


Introduction
**1**


**2**



To get a sense of what students are trying to accomplish, consider what is involved in reading the
following three words: _ham_, _sham_, _shame_ .


 - To read _ham_, the reader needs to inspect each letter, remember which sound each letter represents,
and then blend the three sounds together.


 - To read _sham_, the reader must do all of these things but must also recognize that ‘s’ and ‘h’ are
a letter team. The reader may need to discard a first impression that the word begins with two
consonant sounds, /s/ followed by /h/.


 - To read _shame_, the reader must perform all of the tasks mentioned above while also scanning
ahead, spotting the letter ‘e’, connecting the letter ‘e’ to the letter ‘a’, and remembering that these
letters stand for the /ae/ sound. When you add all of these things together, you have a complicated
procedure that students must practice many times before it becomes automatic.


~~**MARKING AND POINTING TIPS**~~


One of the goals of this unit is to help students learn to see and process separated digraphs as
single spelling units. Here are a few ideas about how you can do that.


First of all, there are marking conventions that point out the connection between the letters. In the
Teacher Guide, a caret is placed below the letters to show the connection between the letters of a
separated digraph:


Some teachers prefer to mark the connection with an arch over the top:


Foundational Skills 2


Students can be asked to circle the letters and letter teams that stand for individual sounds. They
can make an amoeba-like shape that encompasses the ‘i’ and the ‘e’ in _bike_, like this:


You can also reinforce the connection by using a pointing tip. When pointing to single-letter spellings
or normal digraphs (written with letters sounded side by side), use a single pointing finger. When
you point to a split digraph, pop out a second finger to make a ‘V’ sign, with one finger pointing at
the first letter in the separated digraph and the other pointing at the final ‘e’.


Note that the split-finger ‘v’ point looks very much like the caret used in the Teacher Guide. That is
one reason why this program prefers that style of notation.


All five of the new spellings taught in this unit are bolded, both in the Reader and the majority of the
activity pages. The bolding in a word like _g_ **a** _m_ **e** is intended to remind students that the ‘a’ and ‘e’ are
working together. You should continue to monitor student performance and give extra support to
students who need it.

~~**SILENT ‘E’ AND MAGIC ‘E’**~~


In years past, you may have spoken of the ‘e’ in words like _name_ or _note_ as silent ‘e’. Or you may have
used the phrase _magic ‘e’_ . Of these two phrases, _magic ‘e’_ is preferred. There are some problems
with telling students that some letters are silent. For one thing, if you think about it, all letters are
silent. If they could speak, we would not have to read them and turn them back into sounds. Also,
the phrase _silent letter_ may lead some students to believe that only some letters in a word matter
as far as determining the pronunciation of the word, while others have no purpose. In fact, the ‘e’
in _kite_ is every bit as important in terms of determining pronunciation as the ‘i’. Without the ‘e’, the
word would be pronounced _kit_ . All in all, _magic ‘e’_ seems to be a better way of capturing what the ‘e’
is doing in these spellings than _silent ‘e’_ . _You are encouraged to avoid teaching the concept of silent_
_‘e’ in this unit and silent letters in general_ . In most cases, it is more useful to think of all of the letters
in a word as representing a sound, either singly or in tandem with other letters. For example, in the
word _light_, it is more useful to think of ‘igh’ as standing for /ie/ than to think of ‘i’ as standing for
/ ie/ and ‘gh’ as being “silent.”


~~**INDIVIDUAL CODE CHART**~~


Students will continue to use the Individual Code Chart in Unit 2. As you teach new sound/spelling
correspondences, students will fill in the information in the Individual Code Charts. You can
encourage students to use their own charts when reading and writing on their own.


~~**TRICKY WORDS**~~


In this unit, eleven Tricky Words are introduced. All of these words are high-frequency words that
cannot be pronounced accurately using blending and the letter-sound correspondences taught so far.


Every Tricky Word has at least one tricky part. However, few of these words are completely irregular.
For most of them, there are some parts that are pronounced and written just as one would expect,
but there are other parts that are tricky and need to be memorized. With each word, you are
encouraged to make an effort to point out which parts are regular and can be blended and which
parts are not regular or contain spellings not yet taught. These parts must simply be remembered.


Foundational Skills 2


Once a Tricky Word has been introduced in a lesson, it will be underlined in the Reader and on
activity pages until it has occurred approximately twenty times, as a signal that the word is tricky.


It is highly recommended that you assess each student’s recognition of these words at both the
beginning and end of the unit. Assessment materials are included in Teacher Resources. You
may also choose to copy and send home the Family Letter and Flash Cards included in Teacher
Resources for practice at home.


If you have a Tricky Word Wall in your classroom, you may want to write each of these new words on
a yellow index card and add it to the word wall as it is introduced.


~~**DECODABLE READER: GRAN**~~


The Reader of this unit is called _Gran_ . It is about a well-traveled grandmother who visits her two
grandchildren, Josh and Jen. You will present some of the stories in the Reader as demonstration
stories. This will allow you to model the process of reading separated digraphs. Each story includes
tips for introducing the story and is accompanied by a set of discussion questions meant to be
answered orally after students have read the story. This will allow you to make sure students have
understood the story, and will also give them the chance to see if their predictions (if they made one
prior to reading the story) have turned out to be correct.


When reviewing the discussion questions, please remember to encourage students to answer in
complete sentences and to identify which part of the text supports their answer.


~~**STORY QUESTIONS ACTIVITY PAGES**~~


Story questions activity pages are included for most stories. Students are asked to read the questions
on the activity page and to either print their answers in the space provided or check the correct
answers, in the case of multiple-choice questions. Rereading of the stories is recommended. You
should encourage students to answer the questions using complete sentences. As you assess
students’ writing on the story questions activity pages, you are encouraged to accept all phonetically
plausible spellings. For example, you should, for the time being, accept _funnee_ for _funny_, _wate_ for _wait_,
_nite_ for _night_, and _bote_ for _boat_, as students have not yet learned the spelling alternatives.


~~**GRAMMAR**~~


The grammar lessons in this unit focus on nouns, including proper nouns, and sentence building.
Grammar is reviewed in some of the Warm-Ups as well. Have students practice their noun
identification skills whenever they are reading a story from the Reader of this unit.

~~**WRITING**~~


**Left-handed Handwriting Guidance**

 - Consider your seating arrangement for left-handed students. The placement of the arms and elbows
in relation to other students can impact their writing space.


 - Encourage your students to hold their writing tools correctly to reduce hand strain. Allow time for
students to develop their hand strength in writing.


 - Providing pencil grips for students could alleviate the strain on their hands when writing.


 - Orienting the paper at an angle can help left-handed students write more easily and comfortably.
Consider using paper with a raised line for students to rest their hands on as they write.


~~**UNIT 2 ASSESSMENTS**~~


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


Throughout this unit, formative assessments are clearly marked for monitoring individual
student performance and progress in key skills, including oral reading of decodable stories and
understanding of those same stories.


Observation records for recording student performance are included in Teacher Resources. You
may want to have a clipboard with the blank Anecdotal Reading Records, one for each student in
the class, arranged in alphabetical order. A second clipboard may be used to hold other observation
records, such as the Discussion Questions Observation Record.


Quick “Checks for Understanding” are also designated throughout various lessons.


Careful attention to this information, collected on a daily basis, will enable teachers to quickly
determine which students may benefit from reteaching and/or more practice in particular skills,
using the Additional Support activities found at the end of each lesson.


**Student Performance Assessment**


In Lesson 18, you will be prompted to administer a multipart assessment. In the Word Recognition
Assessment, students will be asked to look at several words on the designated activity page and
then circle the written word that matches the spoken word you say. The target words include the
vowel sound spellings taught in this unit; distractors have been intentionally selected because they
represent frequent sound/spelling confusions. Student performance on this assessment is a good
indicator of whether students have mastered the new sound spellings.


Foundational Skills 2


Students will also be asked to independently read a new story in _Gran_ and then answer written
comprehension questions about the selection.


In Lesson 19, you will administer a simple assessment to determine whether students are able to
identify examples of nouns that may be a person, place, or thing.


Use the results of these assessments to inform your instruction and grouping and to help you
determine how to best use the Pausing Point exercises before advancing to Unit 3.


In order to track students’ progress over the school year, create an individual assessment portfolio
for each student and place his or her assessments and running records in it. This will allow you and
parents to see the progress students have made in the course of the year. It might also be helpful to
have the portfolios travel with students from grade to grade. The progress students have made over
the school year will then be even more apparent.


~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice Unit 2 skills can be found in
the Pausing Point section included after the last lesson. Pause for 2 days to provide targeted
remediation for individual or groups of students in any areas in which they performed poorly on the
end-of-unit assessment.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


In the Teacher Resources section at the end of this Teacher Guide, you will find forms and charts
which may be useful, including the following:


  - Anecdotal Reading Record—Unit 2


  - Discussion Questions Observation Record—Unit 2


  - Tricky Word Family Letter


  - Tricky Word Flash Cards


  - Tricky Word Assessment Record: Beginning and End of Unit 2

**Code Flip Book Review**

  - Before beginning the activity, take out and display the Vowel Code Flip
Book within view of all students; ensure students have their Individual
Code Charts.


  - Remind students that the Individual Code Chart contains spellings for
vowel sounds. Tell students that they can use their charts when they need
reminders about how to sound out and write vowel spellings.


  - Write the word _flat_ on the board/chart paper. Tell students that if you came
to this word and were unsure how to say it, you could use the Individual Code
Chart to help figure out how to pronounce it. Point to the ‘a’ in _flat_ and ask
students to find this spelling on **page 1** in the **Individual Code Chart** . Ask
students, “What example word is under this spelling?” _(hat)_ If the letter ‘a’ for
this word is pronounced like /a/ in _hat_, then I can try the same thing for this
word: /f/ /l/ /a/ /t/, _flat_ . Check to make sure it sounds right.”


  - Show students the /a/ > ‘a’ sound/spelling in the **Vowel Code Flip Book**
on **page 1** .


  - Review by saying, “This tells us that /a/ is spelled with the letter ‘a’ in written
words. The power bar here shows me that this is a common way to write /a/,

Foundational Skills 2


so if I was trying to spell and write a word with the /a/ sound ( _flat, clap, snap_ ),
I would spell it with the letter ‘a’.” (In fact, it is the only spelling for /a/ taught in
Grade 1; less common spellings such as ‘au’ as in _laugh_ and _aunt_ will be taught
in later grades. This information can be deduced based on the fact that there
are no other spots on the chart in this row for other ways to spell /a/.)


 - Review all of the remaining short vowel sound/spelling correspondences /e/,
/i/, /o/, /u/ using **Vowel Code Flip Book** **pages 2–5** .


 - Tell students to keep their Individual Code Charts on their desks, as they will
learn a new sound/spelling today.


~~**INTRODUCE THE SOUND /EE/ (5 MIN.)**~~

 - Ask students to repeat the following words that have the /ee/ sound at the
end: _bee, me, key, tree_ .


 - Ask students if they think /ee/ is a vowel sound or a consonant sound. (It is a
vowel sound, made with an open mouth and an unobstructed flow of air.)


 - Tell students that you are going to say a number of words. Some of the words
will have the /ee/ sound as their middle sound and some will not.


 - Have students close their eyes and listen carefully. Tell students to raise their
hands when they hear a word that has the /ee/ sound as its middle sound.


**Note:** Remember that this is oral practice. Students are only listening for the
/ee/ sound, not seeing the different spellings.


1. cheek 5. pin


2. cheap 6. deep


3. bed 7. bean


4. meet 8. hen



Support


If students have trouble
hearing a word’s middle
sound, say the word in a
segmented fashion:
/ch/ . . . /ee/ . . . /k/, and
then repeat the word in its
blended form, _cheek_ .


Gather pictures of the words
listed to provide students
with visual support.


Challenge


For extra segmenting
practice, have students
segment each word before
deciding if it contains the
/ee/ sound.

Have students close their eyes and listen carefully. Tell students to raise their hands

when they hear a word containing the /ee/ sound.


~~**INTRODUCE THE SPELLING /EE/ › ‘EE’ (10 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iii**~~


**Teacher Modeling**

  - Tell students that you are going to show them how to write the /ee/ sound.


  - Write ‘ee’ on handwriting guidelines, and explain that the two letters work
together to stand for the /ee/ sound.


  - Model drawing the spelling two or three more times, repeating the sound
each time you write it.


  - Turn to **Vowel Code Flip Book page 7** and put the Spelling Card /ee/ > ‘ee’
( _bee_ ) on the appropriate space. Have students read the sample word. Discuss
the power bar. Explain that the mid-length power bar means that the /ee/
sound is sometimes spelled this way, but not always.

|Vowel Code Flip Book|Individual Code Chart|
|---|---|
|1.<br>/ee/ > ‘ee’ (_bee_) **page 7**|1.<br>/ee/ > ‘ee’ (_bee_) **page 2**|



  - Have students trace the spelling on their desks with a pointed finger while
saying the sound.


  - Now have students find the ‘ee’ spelling on their **Individual Code Chart**
**page 2** and trace the code information in green marker. Remind students
that when they see ‘ee’ when reading, they can look at the Individual Code
Chart if they need help remembering how to sound out this spelling.


  - Tell students that whenever the spelling ‘ee’ appears on an activity page or
in a story for the next few lessons, it will be printed in darker, bolder ink to
remind them that the two letters stand for a single sound.


**TEKS 1.2.B.iii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic awareness by decoding words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe
syllables; vowel teams, including vowel digraphs and diphthongs; and r-controlled syllables.

**Note:** You may have students who know that some of the words they listened
to earlier, such as _eat_, are written with spellings other than ‘ee’. If students
point this out, congratulate them for recognizing this and already knowing
other spellings for the /ee/ sound. Tell them they will learn these spellings
for /ee/ at a later time, and for now they just have to focus on the ‘ee’
spelling.


~~**PRACTICE /EE/ › ‘EE’ (10 MIN.)**~~


**Small Group**

  - Distribute Activity Page 1.1.


  - Review how to write the spelling of /ee/.


  - Instruct students to copy the spellings and words printed on the front of the
activity page.


  - As a class, look at the back of the activity page. Review the names of the
pictures and ask students to read the words in the box at the top.


  - Divide students into groups for small group time.


**Group 1:** Ask students who are able to do independent work to complete
the activity page on their own or with a partner. If students finish early, they
can illustrate and write a sentence about one of the words in the chart you
prepared in advance.

  - Tell students that today they will begin reading a story from their new Reader,
_Gran,_ as you read aloud from the Big Book.


  - Show students the cover and point to the title.


  - Have students read the title, and then ask, “What do you think the name _Gran_
is short for?” _(Grandma or Grandmother)_


  - Tell students that this book has three main characters: Gran and her
grandchildren, Josh and Jen. Remind students that characters are the main
people in the story. In this book, Gran is very adventurous and likes to try new
things.


  - Show students the table of contents, pointing to the first story and reading
the title “Gran’s Trips.”


  - Remind students that a story’s title often provides a clue as to what the story
is about. Based on the title, ask students what they think this story might be
about.


  - Point to the apostrophe in _Gran’s_ . Tell students that this punctuation mark,
which looks like a comma “up in the air” is called an apostrophe. It tells us
that the next word after _Gran’s_, _trips_, belongs to Gran. Write the following
examples on the board/chart paper and have students explain what the
apostrophe means in these examples: _Nat’s cat_ and _Beth’s mom_ .

~~**SOUND/SPELLING REVIEW (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Gather the Large Letter Cards listed in the Lesson at a Glance. Be sure to
include vowel spellings and go over the ‘ee’ spelling for the sound /ee/ at
least twice.


  - Hold up each card and have students say the sound represented by the
spelling on the card. If the spelling is a letter team, you could have students
also name the letters.


  - After students say the sound represented on each card, ask them to identify
whether it is a vowel or consonant sound. (Students could hold up fingers
depicting ‘v’ or a ‘c’ so you can monitor each student individually and give
additional support as needed.)


  - Sort the letter cards into two separate piles—vowel spellings and consonant
spellings. Ask students whether they know more consonant or vowel
spellings. (consonant)


~~**TEACHER CHAINING (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that when we read a word that has the letter ‘e’, one
‘e’ is usually pronounced /e/, and the two ‘e’s side by side are usually
pronounced /ee/.


  - Write fed on the board/chart paper.


  - Ask the students to read the word in their mind, first in a segmented fashion

**Tricky Word: He**

 - Write the Tricky Word he on the board/chart paper and ask students how
they would pronounce it by blending. (They might say /h/ /e/: heh.)


 - Explain that this word is actually pronounced /h/ /ee/, as in, “He is nice.”


 - Point to the letter ‘h’ and explain that it is pronounced /h/, as they would
probably expect.


 - Underline the letter ‘e’ and explain that it is the tricky part of the word. Ask
students, “What sound do you expect to make when you read this spelling?”


 - Students would probably expect this letter to be pronounced /e/. Say the
word he as /h/ /e/, Ask students, “Does that sound right?” Tell students that
he is a Tricky Word.


 - Tell students that when reading he, they should try to remember to
pronounce the letter ‘e’ as /ee/.


 - Tell students that when writing he, they have to remember to spell the /ee/
sound with the letter ‘e’.


 - Have students copy the word on an index card and underline the tricky part
of the word, ‘e’.


**Tricky Words: She, Be, Me, and We**

 - Write the word she on the board/chart paper. Ask students, “If this Tricky
Word follows the same pattern as the word he, how would we read it?”


 - Tell students that she is tricky in the same way that he is, meaning the letter
‘e’ is pronounced /ee/, and not /e/ as they would expect.

**Lesson 2: Common and Proper Nouns**

Language



10M



**Primary Focus:** Students will identify the nouns
distinguish between common and proper nouns.



~~**TEKS 1.11.D.iii**~~





~~**IDENTIFY PROPER NOUNS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that they have learned about nouns that name people,
places, or things.


  - Explain that today students will learn about special kinds of nouns called
proper nouns. They are called proper because they name someone or
something specific.


  - Say: “Jane and girl.” Ask students which noun refers to a specific person.
(Jane)


  - Explain that Jane is a proper noun because it names a specific person.


  - Explain that each person in the room has a proper noun for their name.


  - Say a student’s name and ask that student to raise his or her hand. Point out
that not everyone has this name, so we know it refers to a specific person.


  - Then say the word girl and ask all the girls in the class to raise their hands.


  - Point out that the word girl refers to many students in the class, not just one.
Therefore, it is not a proper noun.


  - Repeat this procedure with a boy’s name and the boys in the class.


**TEKS 1.11.D.iii** Edit drafts using standard English conventions including singular, plural, common, and proper nouns.


Foundational Skills 2


 - Summarize the proper noun information by asking students why we have
proper nouns. (Students should understand that there are particular or
specific people or things that need to be named so they can be identified.)


Check for Understanding


Have students give an example of a proper noun as they transition to the next activity

or exit the classroom.

Foundational Skills 2


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


In this lesson you will introduce the first of four separated digraphs, ‘a_e’ as
in _game_ . The two letters of each digraph are working together (as a letter
team) to stand for a single sound, but the letters are separated from each
other by another spelling. Reading words with separated digraphs therefore
poses a new challenge to students. So far, students have been taught to read
words from left to right, but in order to read words with separated digraphs,
they need to begin scanning to the right and then glancing back again to
the left. Students must practice this skill many times before it becomes
automatic. Please note that this lesson does not contain a Warm-Up exercise.


**Foundational Skills**

  - You may wish to tab Vowel Code Flip Book page 6 for Introduce the Spelling
/ae/ > ‘a_e’.


  - Gather the Spelling Card listed in the Lesson at a Glance and green markers
for Introduce the Spelling /ae/ > ‘a_e’.


**Reading**

  - Plan to assign students to small groups. Group 1 is for students who are
experiencing some challenges. Group 2 is for students who are able to work
more independently. These groups are flexible and should change to meet
students’ needs. Today you will work with students in Group 1, while students
in Group 2 partner read.


  - Prepare the Anecdotal Reading Record for use with students in Group 1 as
they reread either “Gran’s Trips” or “The Pet” aloud.


**Universal Access**

  - Gather pictures of the following words for Introduce the Sound /ae/: _ape,_
_(ginger) ale, game, tape, cake, mane_ .

**Hear the New Sound /ae/** ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.i; TEKS 1.2.A.ii; TEKS 1.2.A.iii**~~


**Note:** Remember this is oral practice. Students are only listening for the
/ ae/ sound, not seeing the different spellings. Tell students to listen carefully
for the long _a_ sound.


  - Tell students that today’s sound is /ae/ as in _late_ .


  - Have students say the /ae/ sound several times.


  - Ask students to repeat the following words that have the /ae/ sound at the
beginning: _aim_, _ape_, _ate_, _ale_ . Tell students these words all have the same
initial sound.


  - Ask students to repeat the following words that have the /ae/ sound in the
middle: _game_, _tape_, _cake_, _mane_ .


  - Ask students to repeat the following rhyming words and to notice that they
have the /ae/ sound at the end: _may_, _play_, _day_, _stay_ .


  - Ask students if /ae/ is a vowel sound or a consonant sound. On your signal,
students can use their fingers to depict a ‘v’ or ‘c’ to show if it is a vowel or
consonant sound. (It is a vowel sound, made with an open mouth and no
obstruction of airflow.)


**TEKS 1.2.A** Demonstrate phonological awareness by (iii) distinguishing between long and short vowel sounds in one-syllable
words; (vii) segmenting spoken one-syllable words of three to five phonemes into individual phonemes, including words with

Foundational Skills 2


**Note:** You may have students who know that some of the words they listened
to earlier, such as _may_, are written with spellings other than ‘a_e’. If students
point this out, congratulate them for recognizing this and already knowing other
spellings for the /ae/ sound. Tell them that they will learn these spellings for
/ae/ at a later time, and for now they will focus on the ‘a_e’ spelling.


Check for Understanding


Have students share words with the /ae/ sound with their neighbor, and move

around the room to monitor responses.


~~**INTRODUCE THE SPELLING /AE/ › ‘A_E’ (15 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iii**~~


**Teacher Modeling**

  - Tell students you are going to show them how to write the /ae/ sound.


  - Explain that the spelling for /ae/ is a little different from the other spellings
they have studied so far.


  - Write ‘a_e’ on the board/chart paper, explaining that the two letters work
together to stand for the /ae/ sound.


  - Point out that you left a space between the letter ‘a’ and the letter ‘e’.


  - Explain that when you write an actual word, you will fill in the space with the
spelling for the sound that comes after the /ae/ sound.


  - Add ‘g’ and ‘m’ to make _game_ .


  - Explain that the letter ‘a’ and the letter ‘e’ work together (as a letter team) to
stand for one sound, the /ae/ sound. They are working together even though
there is a letter between them.


  - Illustrate this by drawing a V-shaped mark connecting ‘a’ and ‘e’ (see
illustration).


  - Explain that the word _game_ contains four letters (‘g’, ‘a’, ‘m’, ‘e’) but only three
sounds (/g/ /ae/ /m/). Tap your fingers together to segment the word and
demonstrate that _game_ only has three sounds.


  - Now write _bake_ . Point to each spelling in _bake_ as you say its sound: “/b/
(point to ‘b’ with your index finger), /ae/ (simultaneously point to ‘a’ with
your index finger and ‘e’ with your middle finger), /k/ (point to ‘k’ with your
index finger).”


**TEKS 1.2.B.iii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic awareness by decoding words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe
syllables; vowel teams, including vowel digraphs and diphthongs; and r-controlled syllables.







If you prefer, you can use
any of the following terms:
split digraph, separated
spelling, separate letter
team, magic ‘e’ spelling.

words in other texts
and write and illustrate
the words.


**42**




- Draw a V-shaped mark connecting ‘a’ and ‘e’ in _bake_ .


- Write the word _name_ on the board/chart paper and explain that this is
another example of the letter team ‘a’-space-‘e’ spelling for /ae/.


- Draw a V-shaped mark under _name_ as you did with _game_ and _bake_ .


- Now ask students to help you spell the word _made_ .


- Have students identify the first sound in _made_ . Write ‘m’ on the board/chart
paper.


- Have students identify the second sound in _made_ .


- Once the /ae/ sound has been identified, write an ‘a’ on the board/chart
paper next to the ‘m’.


- Explain that this letter ‘a’ is the first part of the spelling for /ae/. You will write
the second part after you write the spelling for the sound that comes after
the /ae/ sound.


- Have students identify the last sound in _made_ . Write ‘d’ on the board/chart
paper next to ‘a’.


- Explain that if you left the word like this, it would be pronounced _mad_ . To spell
_made_, you need to add the letter ‘e’.


- Remind students that the ‘a’ and ‘e’ work together as a team to stand for the
/ae/ sound.


- Tell students that this kind of spelling is sometimes called a magic ‘e’
because the ‘e’ changes _mad_ to _made_ .


- Turn to **Vowel Code Flip Book page 6** . Show students the Spelling Card
for /ae/ > ‘a_e’ ( _cake_ ). Discuss the power bar and have a student read the
example word. Attach the Spelling Card to the appropriate space.


- Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart page 2** . Have them locate and
trace the code information for /ae/ > ‘a_e’ with their green marker and read
the example word.

guided practice.


  - Distribute Activity Page 3.1.


  - Explain that each of the thick black lines on the page stands for one sound/
spelling.


  - Have students look at the example at the top of the page.


  - Now say the word _mad_, hold up three fingers, and segment the word,
/m/ /a/ /d/.


  - Point out that the word _mad_ contains three sounds and is spelled with
three letters.


  - Say the word _made_, hold up three fingers, and segment the word, /m/
/ae/ /d/.


  - Point out that the word _made_ also contains three sounds, but it is spelled
with four letters.


  - Draw attention to the caret or V-shaped mark under the word _made._


  - Explain that the V-shaped mark shows that the letters ‘a’ and ‘e’ are working
together even though they are not right next to each other. Have students put
their fingers on the ‘a’ and ‘e’ in the word _made_ .


  - Ask, “What do we call the letters ‘a’ and ‘e’ when they are working together?”
_(letter team, separated digraph)_


  - Explain that you will dictate, or say aloud, more word pairs and that you want
students to write the words sound by sound on the lines.


  - Say the word _can_, have students segment the word, and then write it on the
lines after the arrow on the same row for item 1. Remind students that the
/ae/ sound is spelled with the separated digraph ‘a_e’.


  - Say the word _cane_, have students segment the word, and then write it on the
lines after the arrow on the same row for item 1. Remind students that the
/ae/ sound is spelled with the separated digraph ‘a_e’.


  - Repeat with the remaining words. As you say and students write each word,

noun in the phrase. The
other words in the phrase
describe the noun or tell

~~**WARM-UP (5 MIN.)**~~


**Noun Identification**

  - Tell students that you will review nouns. Ask students what a noun is. _(person,_
_place, or thing)_


  - Say the phrase, “big feet”. Have students repeat the phrase and ask them to
say which word is a noun. Students should reply, “ _Feet_ is a noun.”


  - Ask students if the noun _feet_ names a person, place, or a thing. _(It names a_
_thing.)_


  - Repeat with the remaining phrases.


**Note:** Remember this is an oral activity. Students should not be expected to
read these phrases, as they are not yet decodable.

**Primary Focus:** Students will demonstrate knowledge of the ‘a_e’ vowel pattern by
decoding words with the letter-sound correspondences /a/ > ‘a’ and /ae/ > ‘a_e’.


~~**TEKS 1.2.A.iv; TEKS 1.2.B.i**~~



~~**POP-OUT CHAINING (15 MIN.)**~~



~~**TEKS 1.2.B.i**~~



**Note:** For this chaining exercise, you will call the letter ‘e’ of the digraph ‘a_e’
the magic letter ‘e’. The ‘e’ is magical because it can change the vowel sound
/a/, as in _at_, into the vowel sound /ae/, as in _ate_ .


  - Using the Large Letter Cards you gathered in advance, review each sound as
you pass them out.


  - Hand one student the ‘e’ card, and tell them that they now hold the magic ‘e’.


  - Tell students that you will ask students holding the letter cards to come to
the front of the room to spell some words. Explain that the student with the
magic ‘e’ card has a special job. After each word is made with the other Large
Letter Cards, you will say “Alakazam!” which means that the student with the
magic ‘e’ card should jump up and add the magic ‘e’ to the end of the word,
thus changing the vowel sound and making a new word.


  - Say the word _at_ . Tell students who are holding cards with spellings in the
word _at_ to go to the front of the room and stand in the order needed to spell
the word _at_ . Ask the class to sound out and read the word.


  - Tell students that you are going to magically change the vowel sound in the
word. Say, “Alakazam!” and have the holder of the magic ‘e’ stand at the end
to create the word _ate_ .


  - Ask, “Even though they aren’t side by side in this word, which two letters are
working together as a team?”


  - Have students holding the ‘a’ and the ‘e’ step forward and stand side by side.


  - Point out that the ‘a’ and ‘e’ in the word _ate_ work together to stand for the
sound /ae/.


**TEKS 1.2.A.iv** Demonstrate phonological awareness by recognizing the change in spoken word when a specified phoneme is
added, changed, or removed; **TEKS 1.2.B.i** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words in isolation and in

Support


While some of the
students are making
the words with the
Large Letter Cards, the
other students could be
using small letter cards,
alphabet magnets, or
letter tiles to be making
the same words.



Lesson 4 Review: Common Nouns and /ae/ › ‘a_e’
**53**


**Note:** Pop-out chaining allows for extra practice segmenting words. Start
by standing behind students holding the Large Letter Cards. To segment the
word, hold your hand over the head of each student holding a card, saying
the sound each letter represents as a class. When you arrive at the first letter
of the separated digraph, hold one hand over the student holding the vowel
card and the other hand over the student holding the magic ‘e’ card at the
same time. You may point out that your arms are making a V-shaped mark
similar to what students have seen in the activity pages.


 - Repeat this process with the remaining word pairs.


 - Allow several different students to take a turn playing the magician
holding the magic letter ‘e’. You may also want to redistribute the other
Large Letter Cards midway into the activity, so more students have a chance
to be actively involved.

The task of applying a silly
voice requires notable
cognitive effort. Silly
Voices should be used
to motivate students to
revisit text that is already
very familiar from prior
instruction and rereading.
If students are not already
reading the text with high
accuracy, then rereading
without silly voices to first
establish ease with word
recognition is appropriate.

word, hold your hand over the head of the each student holding the cards,
saying the sound each letter represents as a class. When you arrive at the
first letter of the separated digraph, hold one hand over the student holding
the vowel card and the other hand over the student holding the magic ‘e’ card
at the same time. You may point out that your arms are making a V-shaped
similar to what students have seen in the activity book pages.


 - Repeat this process with the remaining word pairs.


 - Redistribute the Large Letter Cards midway in the activity, and allow several
different students to take a turn playing the magician with the magic letter ‘e’.
Remind students that words with a_e make a long a vowel sound.


1. man > mane 5. cap > cape


2. pan > pane 6. tap > tape


3. pal > pale 7. fat > fate


4. at > ate 8. nap > nape


Check for Understanding


After completing the word pairs, ask, “What happens when you add ‘e’ to the
end of a word?” _(It changes the other vowel sound_ . _)_ Ask students to think and
then share with a neighbor. Monitor responses, and note students who may
need extra guidance.


~~**INTRODUCE TRICKY WORDS: THEY, THEIR (10 MIN.)**~~


**Tricky Word: They**

 - Write the Tricky Word _they_ on the board/chart paper and ask students how
they would pronounce this word by blending. (They might say something like
/th/ /e/ /y/.)


 - Explain that this word is actually pronounced /th/ /ae/ as in, “ _They_ are my
friends.”


 - Circle the letter team ‘th’ and explain that it is pronounced /th/, as students
might expect.


Foundational Skills 2


  - Underline the letters ‘e’ and ‘y’ and explain that they are the tricky part of the
word. Students would probably expect these letters to be pronounced /e/
/y/, but they are pronounced /ae/.


  - Tell students that when reading _they_, they should try to remember to
pronounce the letters ‘e’ and ‘y’ as /ae/.


  - Tell students that when writing _they_, they have to remember to spell the
/ae/ sound with the letters ‘e’ and ‘y’.


  - Have students copy the word on an index card and underline the tricky part
of the word.


**Tricky Word: Their**

  - Write the Tricky Word _their_ on the board/chart paper and ask students how
they would pronounce it by blending. (They might say something like /th/
/e/-/i/ /r/.)


  - Explain that this word is actually pronounced /th/ /e/ /r/ as in, “ _Their_
parents are at home.”


  - Explain that this word is pronounced exactly like the Tricky Word _there_ that was
taught in Unit 1. _There_ is spelled differently and has a different meaning. Give
two examples: “The cat is _there_ by the house,” vs. “This is _their_ cat.”


  - Circle the letter team ‘th’ and explain that it is pronounced /th/, as they
would probably expect.


  - Underline the letters ‘e’ and ‘i’ and explain that they are the tricky part of the
word. They would probably expect these letters to be pronounced /e/ /i/, but
they are pronounced /e/.


  - Circle the letter ‘r’ and explain that it is pronounced /r/, as they would
probably expect.


  - Tell students that when reading _their_, they have to remember to pronounce
the letters ‘e’ and ‘i’ as /e/.


  - Tell students that when writing _their_, they have to remember to spell the /e/
sound with the letters ‘e’ and ‘i’.

  - Print a copy of **Activity Page TR 5.2** for each student on yellow card stock.
Cut apart the word cards.


  - Explain that the green cards are printed with regular words and can be read
by blending. Green means go.


  - Explain that the yellow cards are printed with Tricky Words. Yellow means
proceed with caution.


  - Shuffle the cards and have students read them one at a time.


  - When students select a green card they may say, “Green, go!” before reading
the word.


  - When students select a yellow card they may say, “Yellow, careful!” before
reading the word.


~~**PROGRESS MONITORING (OPTIONAL)**~~


  - Make a copy of the Word Cards for Progress Monitoring 1 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 5.3** ). Cut apart the word cards.


  - Make one copy of the Record Sheet for Progress Monitoring 1 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 5.4** ) for each student you are assessing.


  - Working one-on-one, model with the sample item.


  - Show the cards to the student one at a time and have the student read the
word aloud. Use the Record Sheet to record each word as the student reads.


  - Place a check next to each word read correctly.


  - For misread words, write exactly what the student says as the word is
sounded out. If the student misreads a word, prompt them to try to read the
word again, letting them know their first attempt was incorrect.


  - Students may benefit from the supports utilized during instruction such as
blending motions and representing sounds with objects (e.g., Push and Say).
Demonstrate and encourage their use while modeling with the sample item
if needed. The goal is for students to eventually be capable of completing
the tasks without physical supports or, at least, utilizing the supports
independently (without your prompt).


Lesson 5 Tricky Words: Introduce: They and Their

**72**



**Scoring:** Scoring is based on one point assigned for every vowel digraph in a
word which is read correctly. Interpret scores as follows:


   - 9 or 10 points—excellent


   - 8 points—good


   - 6 or 7 points—fair


   - Less than 6 points—poor


**Goal:** Achieve scores of good or excellent (8 points or more).


Scores of 7 or less indicate additional reteaching and reinforcement
is required.


Further analyze student errors to determine whether there are one or more
particularly problematic sound/spellings. The subtotals for targeted sound/
spellings at the bottom of the Record Sheet facilitate the identification of
specific problem areas.


Also examine whether there are mispronunciations occurring more
frequently in a given position in words. For example, does the student read
the initial sound correctly, but misread the medial and/or final sound?


Finally, examine whether the student succeeded in reading words correctly
on the second attempt. If so, the student may be rushing and may benefit
from explicit instruction to slow down and look at each letter in a word
sequentially, left to right.


**Code Knowledge**


Before today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
495 and 622 of those words would be completely decodable.


After today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
501 and 630 of those words would be completely decodable.


The word _they_ is one of the 20 most common words in most samples of written English.
In a typical passage of 1,000 words, the word _they_ occurs 4 to 9 times.


The word _their_ is one of the 60 most common words in most samples of written English.
In a typical passage of 1,000 words, the word _their_ occurs 0 to 4 times.

 - Explain that today’s spelling is another separated spelling, or magic ‘e’
spelling, like ‘a_e’ in _name_ .


 - Write ‘i_e’ on handwriting guidelines, and explain that the two letters work
together to stand for the /ie/ sound.


 - Point out that you left a space between the letter ‘i’ and the letter ‘e’ and
explain that when you write an actual word, you will fill in the space with the
spelling for the sound that comes after the /ie/ sound.

If students have trouble
hearing a word’s middle
sound, say the word in a
segmented fashion:
/p/ . . . /ie/ . . . /n/. Then
repeat the word in its

line, and lane to provide
visual support.



Lesson 6 Basic Code: Introduce /ie/ › ‘i_e’
**77**


 - Add ‘b’ and ‘k’ to spell the word _bike_ .


 - Read the word and explain that the letter ‘i’ and the letter ‘e’ work together
to stand for one sound, the /ie/ sound, even though there is a letter
between them.


 - Illustrate this by drawing a V-shaped mark connecting the ‘i’ and ‘e’.
(see illustration)


 - Point to each spelling as in the word _bike_ as you say its sound: “/b/ (point
to ‘b’ with your index finger), /ie/ (simultaneously point to ‘i’ with your
index finger and ‘e’ with your middle finger), /k/ (point to ‘k’ with your
pointer finger).”


 - Explain that the word _bike_ contains four letters (‘b’, ‘i’, ‘k’, ‘e’), but only three
sounds (/b/, /ie/, /k/).


 - Now write the word _time_ on the board/chart paper, and explain that this is
another example of the ‘i’-space-’e’ spelling for the /ie/ sound.


 - Draw a V-shaped mark under _time_ as you did with _bike_ . Ask students to read
the word _time_ with you.


 - Ask students to help you spell the word _pine_ .


 - Say the word _pine_ and have students identify the first sound. Write ‘p’ on
the board/chart paper.


 - Have students identify the second sound in the word _pine_ .


 - Once the /ie/ sound has been identified, write an ‘i’ on the board/chart paper
next to the ‘p’.


 - Explain that the letter ‘i’ is the first part of the spelling for the /ie/ sound.
You will write the second part after you write the spelling for the sound that
comes after the /ie/ sound.


 - Have students identify the last sound in the word _pine_ . Write an ‘n’ on the
board/chart paper next to the ‘i’.


 - Explain to students that if you left the word like this, it would be pronounced
_pin_ . To spell the word _pine_ you need to add the letter ‘e’.


 - Remind students that ‘i’ and ‘e’ work together to stand for the /ie/ sound.


**Note:** If you prefer, you can use any of the following terms: split digraph,
separated spelling, split spelling, separate letter team, split letter team.

letters.


 - Say the word _pine,_ hold up three fingers, and segment the word, /p/ /ie/ /n/.


 - Point out that the word _pine_ also contains three sounds but is spelled with
four letters.


 - Draw attention to the V-shaped mark under the word _pine_ .


 - Explain that this V-shaped mark shows that the letters ‘i’ and ‘e’ are working
together even though they are not right next to each other. They are a letter
team.


 - Explain that you will dictate, or say, more word pairs and that you want
students to write the words sound by sound on the lines. As you say and
students write each word, use it orally in a sentence.

about a swimming race. Explain that in a swim competition, people swim in a
pool that has been divided into different lanes. Explain that each swimmer in
the race swims in a straight line in their own lane. The lanes have floats that go
straight down the pool so people know where their own swim lane is located.
Using the illustration on page 27, point out that at the start of each race, the

~~**WARM-UP (5 MIN.)**~~


**Identify Proper Nouns**

  - Remind students that proper nouns name something specific, whether it be
a person, place, or thing. Names of people are therefore proper nouns.


  - Name a female student and ask that student to raise her hand. Point out
that there is only one student with that name in the class. The student’s
name is a proper noun.


  - Then say the word _girl_ and ask all the girls in the class to raise their
hands. Point out that the word _girl_ refers to many students in the class,
not just one. The word _girl_ is not a proper noun.


  - Repeat this procedure with a boy’s name.

**Primary Focus:** Students will read previously taught Tricky Words accurately.


~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iii; TEKS 1.2.B.vi**~~


~~**ALPHABETIZE TO THE FIRST LETTER (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Model how to alphabetize to the first letter by writing these words in a line on
the board: _mad, sad, glad._


  - Say, “Let’s look at and say some words we have been learning and then list
them in alphabetical order. Remember, we look at the first letter. The letter
_g_ comes before the letters _m_ and _s_ in the alphabet, so I will write _glad_ first in
our list. The letter _m_ comes after _g_ and before _s,_ so the next word in our list is
_mad.”_


  - Ask students which word should be last in the list. _(_ Elicit _sad_ . _)_


  - Say, “The letter _s_ comes after _m_ in the alphabet, and I will write _sad_
under _mad.”_


  - To practice alphabetizing, use the index cards that you prepared in advance
with the following words: _ramp, art, mat, bark, cord, tent, star, door, far, girl._
Distribute them to ten students who then stand randomly at the front of
the class. Have a volunteer name which word comes first in alphabetical
order. The student with that word moves to the left to start a line of words
in alphabetical order. Continue having students name words until all of the
cards are in order.


~~**TRICKY WORD BASEBALL (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Divide the class into two teams, having one team at a time come to line up at
the board/chart paper. (You may choose to have students stay seated and
divide the class into teams by the manner in which they are seated.) Each
team takes a “turn at bat.”


**TEKS 1.2.E** Alphabetize a series of words to the first or second letter and use a dictionary to find words; **TEKS 1.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (iii) decoding words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams,
including vowel digraphs and diphthongs; and r-controlled syllables; (vi) identifying and reading at least 100 high-frequency

 - Set a timer for ten minutes, and tell students that whichever team has the
most runs when the timer rings is the winning team. Point out that accuracy
is important, so they have to be careful reading the words. At the same
time, speed is also important, so they must pay close attention. The more
turns each team member has to read words, the more likely their team is to
score runs.


 - Show a Tricky Word card and ask the first person on the team to read it aloud. If
the word is read correctly, draw a line from home plate to first base, signifying
a “hit.” This player then goes to the back of the team’s line, while the next
player comes forward to read the next card. If the word is correctly read, draw
a line from first to second base. Play continues this way. If the fourth player
reads the word correctly, draw a line from third base to home plate and mark “1
run” for the team. Play continues for the team so long as no words are misread;
when a word is misread, the next team takes its turn at bat.

Note which students demonstrate difficulty in reading Tricky Words during the game.

Be sure to note whether the student makes errors on decodable parts of the words

or tricky parts of the words.

~~**ADDING, DELETING, AND SUBSTITUTING SYLLABLES (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Using a routine to help students learn to add, delete, and substitute syllables
will reinforce their oral syllable awareness.


**Adding Syllables**

  - To model adding syllables, tell students that you will practice adding
syllables in spoken compound words. If possible, project an image of a cup
for students to see before you say the word _cup_ aloud. If possible, project
an image of a cake, and then say _cake_ aloud. Finally, project an image of a
cupcake.


  - Say, “The name of the food in this picture is a compound (multisyllabic) word.
That means it is made up of two words that have been pushed together. If we
start with the word _cup_ and add the word _cake_, we get a new word with two
syllables: _cupcake.”_


  - Have students repeat the word with you.


  - Ask students if they can think of other one-syllable words to add to _cup_ or
_cake_ to make a new compound word. _(teacup, cheesecake, fruitcake)_


**Deleting Syllables**

  - Next, practice deleting syllables from a compound word.


  - Say, “Let’s practice deleting a syllable from the word _bath•tub.”_


**TEKS 1.2.A** Demonstrate phonological awareness by (iv) recognizing the change in spoken word when a specified phoneme is

**Substituting Syllables**


**Note:** Remember to only use oral instruction and activity for this particular
lesson.


 - Next, practice substituting syllables.


 - Say, “Let’s practice substituting a syllable using the word _sail•boat._
_Substituting_ means to replace a piece of the word with another word part.”


 - Clap the syllables while saying _sail•boat,_ and then have students repeat
after you.


 - Say, “I hear two syllables. Let’s substitute the first syllable, _sail,_ with the word
_tug._ Now we have the word _tug•boat._


 - Repeat the activity with _tooth•brush/hair•brush, sun•set/sun•rise._


~~**INTRODUCE THE SOUND /OE/ (10 MIN.)**~~


**Hear the New Sound**


**Note:** Remember that this is oral practice. Students are only listening for the
/oe/ sound, not seeing the different spellings.


 - Tell students that today’s sound is /oe/ as in _note_ .


 - Have students say the /oe/ sound several times.


 - Ask students to repeat the following words that have the /oe/ sound at the
beginning: _oat_, _omen_, _old_, _ogre_ .


 - Ask students to repeat the following words that have the /oe/ sound in the
middle: _rope_, _boat_, _phone_, _coat_, _hope_ .


 - Ask students to repeat the following words that have the /oe/ sound at the
end: _snow_, _toe_, _grow_, _blow_, _no_ .



Support


Gather pictures of the
words to provide students
with visual support.



Lesson 8 Basic Code: Introduce /oe/ › ‘o_e’
**101**


Support


If students have trouble
hearing a word’s middle
sound, say the word in a
segmented fashion:
/ch/ . . . /oe/ . . . /k/. Then
repeat the word in its
blended form: _choke._




 - Ask students if they think /oe/ is a vowel sound or a consonant sound. (It is a
vowel sound, made with an open mouth and an unobstructed flow of air.)


 - Tell students that you are going to say a number of words. Some of the words
will have the /oe/ sound as their middle sound and some will not.


 - Have students close their eyes and listen carefully.


 - Tell students to raise their hands when they hear a word that has the /oe/
sound as its middle sound.


**Note:** You may have students who know that some of the words they listened
to earlier, such as _old_, are written with spellings other than ‘o_e’. If students
point this out, congratulate them for recognizing this and already knowing
other spellings for the /oe/ sound. Tell them that they will learn these
spellings for /oe/ at a later time, and for now they just have to focus on the
‘o_e’ spelling.


1. choke 5. vote


2. hot 6. boat


3. joke 7. shout


4. moon 8. goat


Check for Understanding


Have students close their eyes and listen carefully. Tell students to raise their hands

when they hear a word containing the /oe/ sound.


~~**INTRODUCE THE SPELLING /OE/ › ‘O_E’ (25 MIN.)**~~


**Teacher Modeling**

 - Tell students that you are going to show them how to write the /oe/ sound.


 - Explain that today’s spelling is another separated spelling, or magic ‘e’
spelling, like ‘a_e’ in _name_ and ‘i_e’ in _time_ .


 - Write ‘o_e’ on handwriting guidelines and explain that the two letters work
together to stand for the /oe/ sound. Be sure to leave a space between the
letters.


Foundational Skills 2





**102**


- Explain that when you write an actual word, you will fill in the space between
the letter ‘o’ and the letter ‘e’ with the spelling for the sound that comes after
the /oe/ sound.


- Add ‘r’ and ‘p’ to make _rope_ .


- Read the word and explain that the letters ‘o’ and ‘e’ work together to stand
for the /oe/ sound even though there is a letter between them.


- Illustrate this by drawing a V-shaped mark connecting ‘o’ and ‘e’ (see illustration).


- Point to each spelling in _rope_ as you say its sound: “/r/ (point to ‘r’ with your
index finger), /oe/ (simultaneously point to ‘o’ with your index finger and ‘e’
with your middle finger), /p/ (point to ‘p’ with your index finger).”


- Explain that the word _rope_ contains four letters (‘r’, ‘o’, ‘p’, ‘e’) but only three
sounds (/r/, /oe/, /p/).


- Now write _note_ on the board/chart paper. Explain that this is another
example of the ‘o’-space-‘e’ spelling for the /oe/ sound.


- Draw a V-shaped mark under _note_ as you did with _rope_ . Ask students to read
the word.


- Now ask students to help you spell the word _hope_ .


- Have students identify the first sound in _hope_ . Write an ‘h’ on the board/chart
paper.


- Have students identify the second sound in _hope_ .


- Once the /oe/ sound has been identified, write an ‘o’ on the board/chart paper
next to the ‘h’.


- Explain that the letter ‘o’ is the first part of the spelling for the sound /oe/.
You will write the second part after you write the spelling for the sound that
comes after the /oe/ sound.


- Have students identify the last sound in _hope_ . Write a ‘p’ on the board/chart
paper next to the ‘o’.


- Explain that if you left the word like this, it would be pronounced _hop_ . To spell
_hope_, you need to add the letter ‘e’.


- Remind students that ‘o’ and ‘e’ work together to stand for the /oe/ sound.


- Turn to **Vowel Code Flip Book page 9** . Show students the Spelling Card
for ‘o_e’ > /oe/ ( _home_ ). Discuss the power bar and have a student read the
example word. Attach the Spelling Card to the appropriate space.

a chart like this.





Activity Page 8.1



.




 - Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart page 3** . Have them locate and
trace the code information for /oe/ > ‘o_e’ in green marker.


 - As students look at the spellings they have outlined in green thus far, ask if
they see recurring patterns. Be sure to point out that the magic ‘e’ acts as
part of a vowel team with the letters ‘a’, ‘i’, and ‘o’ to change the way that each
vowel is sounded in a word. The double ‘e’ also acts as a vowel team to stand
for the /ee/ sound.


 - Tell students that whenever the spelling ‘o_e’ appears on an activity page or
in a story for the next few lessons, it will be printed in darker, bolder ink to
remind them that the two letters stand for one sound.


**Note:** It is recommended that in today’s lesson you update the chart for the
digraphs taught in this unit. As you introduce each new digraph, add a new
line and list two or three example words.


~~**PRACTICE /OE/ › ‘O_E’ (15 MIN.)**~~


**Digraph Dictation**

 - Distribute Activity Page 8.1


 - Explain that each thick black line on the page stands for one sound/spelling.


 - Have students look at the example at the top of the page.


 - Say the word _not_, hold up three fingers, and segment the word, /n/ /o/ /t/.


 - Point out that the word _not_ contains three sounds and is spelled with three
letters.


 - Say the word _note_, hold up three fingers, and segment the word, /n/ /oe/ /t/.


 - Point out that the word _note_ also has just three sounds but is spelled with
four letters.


 - Draw attention to the V-shaped mark under the word _note._


Foundational Skills 2



**104**


  - Explain that the V-shaped mark shows that the letters ‘o’ and ‘e’ are working
together even though they are not right next to each other.


  - Explain that you will dictate five more word pairs and that you want the
students to write the words sound by sound on the lines. As you say and
students write each word, use it in an oral sentence.


1. rob—robe 4. mop—mope


2. hop—hope 5. slop—slope


3. dot—dote


  - Have students trace and copy the words on the back of the activity page. You
may have them write the word three times, or more if time permits. Tell the
students to say the sounds as they write the spellings.

**Match Maker**

 - Make one copy of the picture/word cards ( **Activity Page TR 8.1** ) for each
student or pair of students.


 - Prepare two sets of cards.


 - Shuffle the cards and lay them facedown on the table.


 - Have students turn over two cards at a time, reading each word, attempting
to find matching cards.


 - If a student finds a match, the student can call out “Match,” and keep the
cards for the duration of the game.


 - Continue until all matches have been found.


**Note:** Laminate the cards or copy them on card stock for use in later lessons.


**Code Knowledge**


Before today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
510 and 645 of those words would be completely decodable.


After today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
516 and 650 of those words would be completely decodable.


Students have now been taught at least one way to write 34 of the 44 sounds in English.


The sound /oe/ is the 28th most common sound in English.


The sound /oe/ is spelled ‘o_e’ approximately 16 percent of the time.


The spelling alternatives ‘o’ as in the word _no,_ ‘oe’ as in the word _toe,_ ‘ow’ as in the word
_know,_ and ‘oa’ as in the word _oats_ will be taught at a later time.

  - Once the noun has been correctly identified, ask a student to tell you the
vowel sound in the word _cat_ . _(/a/)_


  - Once the vowel sound has been correctly identified, ask a student to find the
spelling for the sound on **Individual Code Chart page 1** . Students should
then summarize what the class has learned: “We learned to spell the sound
/a/ with the letter ‘a’.”

  - Ask, “What is a noun?” Review that a noun is a person, place, or thing, and
that a proper noun names a specific person, place, or thing.


  - Tell students that you will set a timer for five minutes. With their group, they
will record as many nouns as they can see that are in the classroom. The
group or team will earn 1 point for each noun they identify; the team with the
most points wins. Tell students that they may not list students’ names. When
time is up, they will share their list of nouns with the class. Explain that if they
read a noun that another group has also written down, like _desk_, neither team
receives a point. The team with the most points for unique nouns wins.

  - Distribute the following Large Letter Cards, reviewing each card’s sound as
you pass it out: ‘m’, ‘n’, ‘t’, ‘d’, ‘p’, ‘s’, ‘r’, ‘h’, ‘l’, ‘i’, ‘a’, ‘o’.


  - Pull out the ‘e’ card and hand it to a student, reminding them of the power of
the magic letter ‘e’.


  - Explain that when you say “Alakazam,” the student with the ‘e’ card is to jump
up, lift the card, or turn around to reveal the letter on his or her card.


  - Tell students that many of today’s words are nonsense words, meaning they
are made-up. Tell students this means they will have to listen extra carefully
to the sounds of the words.


  - Say the word _not_ and tell students who are holding cards with spellings in
that word to go to the front of the room and stand in the order that spells _not_ .


  - Tell students that you are going to magically change the vowel sound in the
word. Then say “Alakazam!” and have your helper add the large card ‘e’ to the
end of _not_ to create _note_ .


  - Ask, “Even though they aren’t side by side in this word, which two letters are
working together as team?”


  - Have students holding the ‘o’ and the ‘e’ step forward and stand side by side.


  - Point out that the ‘o’ and ‘e’ in the word _note_ work together to stand for the
sound /oe/.


**Note:** Pop-out chaining allows for extra practice segmenting words. Start
by standing behind students holding the Large Letter Cards. To segment the
word, hold your hand over the head of the students holding the cards, saying
the sound each letter represents as a class. When you arrive to the first letter
of the separated digraph, hold one hand over the student holding the vowel
card and the other hand over the student holding the magic ‘e’ card at the
same time. You may point out that your arms are making a V-shape similar to
what students have seen in the activity pages.

~~**INTRODUCE TRICKY WORDS: MY, BY (10 MIN.)**~~


**Tricky Word: My**


**Note:** Remember to add these Tricky Words to your Tricky Word Wall.


  - Write the Tricky Word _my_ on the board/chart paper, and ask students how
they would pronounce it by blending. (They might say /m/ /y/.)


  - Explain that this word is actually pronounced /m/ /ie/, as in, “ _My_ dog has spots.”


  - Point to the letter ‘m’ and explain that it is pronounced /m/, as students
might expect.


  - Underline the letter ‘y’ and explain that is the tricky part of the word.
Students would probably expect the letter to be pronounced /y/, but it is
pronounced /ie/.


  - Tell students that when reading the word _my_, they should try to remember to
pronounce the letter ‘y’ as /ie/. When writing the word _my_, they should try to
remember to spell the /ie/ sound with the letter ‘y’.


  - Have students copy the word on an index card and underline the tricky part
of the word.


**Tricky Word: By**

  - Write the Tricky Word _by_ on the board/chart paper.


  - Explain that this word is pronounced like the Tricky Word _my_ . The letter ‘y’ is
pronounced /ie/.


  - Have students copy the word on an index card and underline the tricky part
of the word.


**Practice**

  - Have students take out the index cards they made for previously taught
Tricky Words and place them on their desks.


  - Explain that you will say one of the Tricky Words and that you want the
students to hold up the card for that word.

Support


If students have trouble
hearing a word’s middle
sound, say the word in a
segmented fashion:
/k/ . . . /ue/ . . . /t/. Then
repeat the word in its
blended form: _cute._


**140**



**Primary Focus**
Students will identify the /ue/ sound in spoken words. ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.vii**~~


Students will read and write one-syllable words with /u/ > ‘u’ and the vowel
digraph /ue/ > ‘u _e’. ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iii**~~


~~**INTRODUCE THE SOUND /UE/ (10 MIN.)**~~


**Hear the New Sound**


**Note:** Remember, this is oral practice. Students are only listening for the
/ ue/ sound, not seeing the different spellings.


The sound /ue/ is a combination of the sounds /y/ and /oo/. You should be
aware of this, but students do not necessarily need to know this.


  - Tell students that today’s sound is /ue/ as in _cute._


  - Have students say the /ue/ sound several times.


  - Ask students to repeat the following words that have the /ue/ sound at the
beginning: _you, use_ .


  - Ask students to repeat the following words that have the /ue/ sound in the
middle: _cute, cube, mute._


  - Ask students to repeat the following words that have the /ue/ sound at the
end: _cue, few, pew._


  - Ask students if /ue/ is a vowel sound or a consonant sound. (It is a vowel
sound, made with an open mouth and an unobstructed airflow.)


  - Tell students that you are going to say a number of words. Some of the words
will have the /ue/ sound as their middle sound and some will not.


  - Have students close their eyes and listen carefully.


  - Tell students to raise their hands when they hear a word that has the /ue/
sound as its middle sound.


**TEKS 1.2.A.vii** Demonstrate phonological awareness by segmenting spoken one-syllable words of three to five phonemes into
individual phonemes, including words with initial and/or final consonant blends; **TEKS 1.2.B.iii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including vowel digraphs
and diphthongs; and r-controlled syllables.


Foundational Skills 2


**Note:** You may have students who know that some of the words they listened
to earlier, such as _you_, are written with spellings other than ‘u_e’. If students
point this out, congratulate them for recognizing this and already knowing
other spellings for the /ue/ sound. Tell them that they will learn these
spellings for /ue/ at a later time, and for now they just have to focus on the
‘u_e’ spelling.


1. hat 4. red


2. cube 5. mutt


3. mute 6. mule


Check for Understanding


Have students close their eyes and listen carefully. Tell them to raise their hands

when they hear a word containing the /ue/ sound.


~~**INTRODUCE THE SPELLING /UE/ › ‘U_E’ (15 MIN.)**~~


**Teacher Modeling**

 - Tell students you are going to show them how to write the /ue/ sound.


 - Explain that today’s spelling is another separated spelling like the ‘a_e’ in
_name_, the ‘i_e’ in _time_, and the ‘o_e’ in _note_ .


 - Write the spelling ‘u_e’ on handwriting guidelines and explain that both
letters work together to stand for the sound /ue/. Be sure to leave a space
between the letters.


 - Explain that when writing an actual word, students will fill in the space
between ‘u’ and ‘e’ with the spelling for the sound that comes after the /ue/
sound.


 - Add ‘c’ and ‘b’ to make _cube_ .


 - Read the word and explain that the letters ‘u’ and ‘e’ work together to stand
for the /ue/ sound even though there is a letter in between them.


 - Illustrate this by drawing a V-shaped mark connecting ‘u’ and ‘e’ (see
illustration).



Support


Gather pictures of the
words listed to provide
students with visual
support.







Lesson 12 Basic Code: Introduce /ue/ › ‘u_e’
**141**


Code Materials




- Point to each spelling in _cube_ as you say its sound: “/c/ (point to ‘c’ with your
index finger), /ue/ (simultaneously point to ‘u’ with your index finger and ‘e’
with your middle finger), /b/ (point to ‘b’ with your index finger).”


- Explain that the word _cube_ contains four letters (‘c’, ‘u’, ‘b’, ‘e’) but only three
sounds (/k/, /ue/, /b/).


- Write _mule_ on the board/chart paper. Explain that this is another example of
the ‘u’-space-‘e’ spelling for the /ue/ sound.


- Draw a V-shaped mark under _mule_ as you did with _cube_ . Ask students to read
the word.


- Ask students to help you spell the word _cute._


- Have students identify the first sound in _cute_ . Write ‘c’ on the board/chart
paper.


- Have students identify the second sound in _cute_ .


- Once the /ue/ sound has been identified, write a ‘u’ on the board/chart paper
next to the ‘c’.


- Explain that the letter ‘u’ is the first part of the spelling the sound /ue/. You
will write the second part after you write the spelling for the sound that
comes after the /ue/ sound.


- Have students identify the last sound in _cute._ Write a ‘t’ on the board/chart
paper next to the ‘u’.


- Explain that if you left the word like this, it would be pronounced _cut_ . To spell
_cute_, you need to add the letter ‘e’.


- Remind students that ‘u’ and ‘e’ work together to stand for the /ue/ sound.


- Turn to **Vowel Code Flip Book page 10** . Show students the Spelling Card
for /ue/ > ‘u_e’ ( _cute_ ). Discuss the power bar and have a student read the
example word. Attach the Spelling Card to the appropriate space.


- Have students turn to the **Individual Code Chart page 3** . Have them locate
and trace the code information for /ue/ > ‘u_e’ in green marker and read the
example word.

 - Tell students that whenever the spelling ‘u_e’ appears on an activity page or
in a story for the next few lessons, it will be printed in darker, bolder ink to
remind them that the two letters stand for one sound.


**Note:** It is recommended that in today’s lesson you update the chart for the
digraphs taught in this unit.


~~**PRACTICE /UE/ › ‘U_E’ (10 MIN.)**~~


**Digraph Dictation**

 - Distribute Activity Page 12.1. Explain that each thick black line on the page
stands for one sound/spelling.


 - Have students look at the example at the top of the page.


 - Say the word _cut_, hold up three fingers, and segment the word, /k/ /u/ /t/.


 - Point out that the word _cut_ contains three sounds and is spelled with
three letters.


 - Say the word _cute_, hold up three fingers, and segment the word, /k/ /ue/ /t/.


 - Point out that the word _cute_ also contains three sounds but is spelled with
four letters.


 - Draw attention to the V-shaped mark under the word _cute._


 - Explain that this mark shows that the letters ‘u’ and ‘e’ are working together
even though they are not right next to each other.


 - Explain that you will dictate more word pairs and that you want students to
write the words sound by sound on the lines. As you say and students write
each word, use it in an oral sentence.

  - Point to the letter ‘y’ and explain that it is pronounced /y/, as students would
probably expect.


  - Underline the letters ‘o’ ‘u’ ‘r’ and explain that they are the tricky part of the
word. Students would probably expect these letters to be pronounced /o/
/u/ /r/, but they are pronounced /or/.


  - Tell students that when reading _your,_ they have to remember to pronounce

~~**TRICKY WORD BASEBALL (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Divide the class into two teams, having one team at a time come to line up at
the board/chart paper. (You may choose to have students stay seated and
divide the class into teams by the manner in which they are seated.) Each
team takes a “turn at bat.”


 - Set a timer for twenty minutes and tell students that whichever team has the
most runs when the timer rings is the winning team. Point out that accuracy
is important, so they have to be careful reading the words. At the same
time, speed is also important, so they must pay close attention. The more
turns each team member has to read words, the more likely their team is to
score runs.


 - Show a Tricky Word card and ask the first person on the team to read it
aloud. If the word is read correctly, draw a line from home plate to first base,
signifying a “hit.” This player then goes to the back of the team’s line, while
the next player comes forward to read the next card. If the word is correctly
read, draw a line from first to second base. Play continues this way. If the
fourth player reads the word correctly, draw a line from third base to home
plate and mark “1 run” for the team. Play continues for the team so long as
no words are misread; when a word is misread, the next team takes its turn
at bat.

If you have students who score **below 3 out of 5** on this assessment, look
for opportunities during the remainder of the unit to have these students
read “Saved by the Bells” aloud to you. Try to determine whether the
comprehension errors are a function of poor decoding skills.


If a student performs poorly on both the Word Recognition and Reading
Comprehension Assessments, practice reading words with specific digraphs.


If, however, a student does well on the Word Recognition Assessment but
poorly on the Reading Comprehension Assessment, he or she may need
more opportunities rereading stories to build fluency and automaticity.
Consider having this student practice reading the remaining stories in _Gran_
several times before completing the related Pausing Point comprehension
activity pages.

~~**BLEND AND SEGMENT WORDS**~~


**Relay Blending**

 - Divide the class into two teams and have each team form a line.


 - Say a segmented word (e.g., /b/ . . . /ie/ . . . /k/), and ask the first student in
each line to blend it.


 - The student who is first to blend the word correctly gets a point for his or her
team. Both students should then move to the back of their respective lines.


 - If neither student can blend the word correctly, have both students move to
the back of their respective lines and let the next students in line take a turn.


**Sound Hopscotch**

 - Firmly affix spellings from this unit to the floor of your classroom in a
daisy pattern.


 - The center of the daisy should be a spelling for a vowel sound reviewed in this
unit (e.g., ‘a_e’). The petals of the daisy should be spellings for consonant
sounds (e.g., ‘t’, ‘p’, ‘m’, ‘g’, and ‘n’. Tape the spellings securely to the floor.


 - Give a student a starting point such as the picture of the /t/ sound (‘t’). Ask
the student to create a real or silly word by jumping to the center spelling,
then to a petal spelling, and then back to the vowel sound. This is to show
the student that the second part of the vowel digraph follows the spelling for
the consonant sound. Possible words are _tape, tame, pane, mate, mane, gate,_
_gape, game, Nate, nape, name_ .


 - Make sure that the student says the sounds that the spellings stand for as he
or she is jumping on them.


 - The other students should blend the word after the jumping student has
come to a halt.


 - You can also play this game outside on the playground.


**Consonant Blends**

 - Use this routine when teaching one-syllable spoken words.


 - Say, “You are going to practice blending and segmenting sounds in words
with consonant blends.”


Foundational Skills 2


  - Say the word _slip._ Follow the routine above to blend and segment the word.
Point out that the first two sounds, /s/ and /l/, blend together to make ‘sl’.
Have students say ‘sl’ and notice how it feels on their tongues.


  - Say the following words: _trip, brunch._ Have students identify the blends and
whether they are at the beginning or end of the words. Then have them blend
and segment the phonemes using motions from the program.


~~**TEKS 1.2.A.v; TEKS 1.2.A.vii**~~


~~**RECOGNIZE AND ISOLATE THE SOUNDS TAUGHT IN UNIT 2**~~


**Sound Search**

  - Say one of the sounds reviewed in this unit and ask students to find an object
in the classroom that begins with that sound.


  - Help students find the first object.


  - When a student has found an object, have them show it to the other students
and say its name.


**Guess the Sound!**

  - Whisper a “secret sound” to one student and ask them to find an object in
the classroom that begins with that sound.


  - When the student points to the object, have the other students guess what
the “secret sound” was.


**Sound Riddles**

  - Tell students that you are going to say some riddles, each of which has an
answer that contains the /ee/ sound.


  - Have students listen and answer.


  - Repeat with riddles for the remaining sounds reviewed in Unit 2.


  - **Variation:** For a change of pace, make this a “teacher challenge.” Ask students
to think of a word that contains one of the target sounds and give you a hint.


**Note:** It might be helpful to use objects or pictures to help students think of
the word you are looking for.


**TEKS 1.2.A** Demonstrate phonological awareness by (v) blending spoken phonemes to form one-syllable words, including
initial and/or final consonant blends; (vii) segmenting spoken one-syllable words of three to five phonemes into individual
phonemes, including words with initial and/or final consonant blends.

~~**RECOGNIZE THE SPELLINGS TAUGHT IN UNIT 2**~~


**Sound/Spelling Review with Large Cards**

 - Distribute all or some of the Large Letter Cards for previously taught sound
spellings. Be sure to include the vowel sounds reviewed in this unit.


 - Tell students that you will call out sounds and that you want the student with
a spelling for that sound to run to the front of the room and hold up the card.


 - Note that for some sounds more than one student will get up because of
spelling alternatives (e.g., ‘ck’ > /k/).


Foundational Skills 2


**Sound/Spelling Review with Individual Code Charts**


There are many ways to use the Individual Code Charts for review. Here are
some ideas:


 - Say one of the new vowel sounds and ask students to show you the spelling
for the sound.


 - Ask students to show you the vowel spellings that are separated by a
consonant sound in a word.


**Spelling Bingo**


**Note:** Use locally approved free Bingo card generators.


 - Make Bingo cards with the spellings reviewed in Units 1 and 2.


 - Write the same spellings on paper slips and put them in a box.


 - Give each student a Bingo card and playing pieces.


 - Explain that you will pull spellings from the box and that you want students to
put a playing piece on top of that spelling if it is on their Bingo card.


 - Explain that when all spellings on a student’s card are covered, that student
should say, “Bingo!”


**Spellings taught in Units 1 and 2:**


1. ‘i’, ‘e’, ‘a’, ‘o’, ‘u’


2. ‘ee’, ‘a_e’, ‘i_e’, ‘o_e’, ‘u_e’

5. ‘bb’, ‘dd’, ‘ff’, ‘gg’, ‘ll’, ‘mm’, ‘ss’, ‘ck’, ‘cc’, ‘nn’, ‘pp’, ‘rr’, ‘tt’, ‘zz’


**Cut Up Digraphs**

 - Write the digraphs for /ae/, /ie/, /oe/, and /ue/ on cards, leaving out the
space between the two letters of each digraph (e.g., ‘a_e’, ‘i_e’).


 - Have students cut the digraphs apart and explain that the letters still
work together.


 - Then have students use string or tape to reconnect the two letters of each
digraph, leaving a space between the individual letters. Have students give
the sound for each separated digraph.





Pausing Point
**217**


**Highlight Digraphs**

 - Write a number of decodable words that contain the digraphs reviewed in
this unit on a sheet of paper.


 - Ask students to read the words and highlight the letters of each digraph.


 - **Extension:** Have students connect the separated digraphs with a
V-shaped mark.


**Step Sounds**

 - Firmly affix two rows of five to eight squares on the floor and have a student
stand at the head of each row.


 - Hold up a spelling for the first student and ask them to say the sound. If the
student says the correct sound, they move one square forward.


 - Repeat this process, alternating between the two students.


~~**WRITE THE SPELLINGS TAUGHT IN UNIT 2**~~


**Sound Dictation**

 - Have students take out pencils and paper.


 - Give out up to twenty Large Letter Cards for the sound/spellings reviewed in
Units 1 and 2. Be sure to include the vowel spellings reviewed in Unit 2.


 - Say a sound and tell the student with the Large Letter Card for that sound to
stand up.


 - Have the other students write the spelling on their paper.


 - Encourage students to draw the spelling with their finger on their desk before
drawing it on paper.


 - Repeat for the remaining sounds.


 - Be sure to give every student the chance to be the keeper of a Large Letter
Card.


**Spellings taught in Units 1 and 2:**


1. ‘i’, ‘e’, ‘a’, ‘o’, ‘u’

~~**TRICKY WORD FAMILY LETTER**~~


Dear Family Member,


In this unit, your student will continue to learn new Tricky Words. Tricky Words are words that do
not follow the rules for encoding that your student has learned, so they simply must learn and
remember them. The tricky parts of each word are underlined. Your student will be taught to read
the following new words at Tricky Words: _he_, _she_, _be_, _me_, _we_ (Lesson 2), _they_, _their_ (Lesson 5), _my_,
_by_ (Lesson 10), _you_ (Lesson 13), and _your_ (Lesson 14). You are being provided with flash cards that
include the new words learned in this unit. Your student should already be able to read all of the
other Tricky Words on the flash cards successfully at the beginning of this unit, as they were taught
in earlier units.


Please have your student cut apart the flash cards. In order to build increasingly rapid, automatic
recognition of these words, show the cards to your student in random order and have them read
them to you as quickly as possible several times each week.

~~**TRICKY WORD ASSESSMENT RECORD: BEGINNING AND END OF UNIT 2**~~


This is an optional assessment of previously taught Tricky Words. At the beginning of Unit 2, show
the student the Tricky Word list that follows this record.


Ask the student to read each word on the list from left to right, top to bottom. Provide students with
either a blank sheet of paper or card stock to place on the word list page directly under the row to be
read. As students complete a row, they can slide the paper down just enough to read the next row.


Record each student’s performance in the following chart, using + to indicate that the word was
read correctly and – to indicate the word was read incorrectly; if the student misreads a completely
different word, record the word read by the student. Mark as incorrect any word that the student
does not read within 3–5 seconds.
