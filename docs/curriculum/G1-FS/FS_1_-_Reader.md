# Beth

I am Beth.


I am ten.


I am at camp.


Camp is fun.


2 3


Once Mom and Dad went on a
trip to the camp. All of us were
at the camp.


Dad and I went up on top of a
path at the pond.


Mom got a snap shot of us.


This is the snap shot.


4 5


Then Mom let us snap some
shots.


Dad got a snap shot of Mom.


6 7


I got a snap shot
of a dog with a hot
dog.


8 9


# Kat and the Trip to the U.K.

This is Kat.


Kat is a kid I met at
camp.


10 11


I have lots of snap shots
of Kat.


This is a snap shot of Kat
with a fish.


12 13


Kat and I had lots of fun at
camp. But then Kat’s mom got a
job in the U. K.


Kat left, and I felt sad.


But then Mom set up
a trip to the U. K.


14 15


Mom and I went on a jet. Ships
are fun, but jets are the best!


I got to sit next to the wing. I
had lunch. Then I had a nap.
Mom got this snap shot of the
nap.


16 17


Kat met us at the end
of the ramp.


I ran up to hug her.


18 19


Then Kat’s mom, Dot, got us
a cab.


This is a snap shot of us
with the cab man.


20 21


Kat and I had a lot of
fun.


Then, Mom and I slept in
a bed next to Kat’s bed.


22 23


# Kat’s Pets

This is a snap shot of Kat’s
cat, Bud.


Kat got Bud from a vet. Bud
had a bad leg. The vet had
to fix Bud’s leg.


24 25


Bud had to sit in a box with a
cast on one leg.


Then Kat said, “Mom, can I have
him? Can I? Can I? Can I?”


Dot said yes.


26 27


This is a snap shot of Kat’s fish.


The fish swim and splash and
munch on fish snacks.


28 29


The cat can smell the fish. It
can press on the glass. It can
grab at the fish. But it can not
get them.


30 31


# The Flag Shop

Mom and I went in a lot of
shops in the U. K. One of the
shops was a flag shop.


The shop had the U. S. flag, the
French flag, and the U. K. flag.


That’s Mom in the snap shot, with
the U. S. flag.


32 33


The U. K. flag has a big
red cross on it. Kat and
her mom held one up.


I got this snap shot of the
two of them with the flag.


34 35


# Which Is the Best?

This is a snap shot Mom got. All
of us had to run up a bunch
of steps to get to this spot.


Kat and I ran up fast. The
moms had to huff and puff to
get to the top.


36 37


This next snap shot is one that I
got. It is Kat with a bunch of big
rocks.


Kat had Mom and Dot lift her
up.


Then Kat said, “Beth, get a snap
shot of this! I am the rock on
top! Get it?”


So which snap shot is the best?


38 39


# The Bus

Dot led us to a bus stop. At the
bus stop there was a thrush.


Kat held up her hand. The
thrush was all set to land on
her hand, but then Dot said,
“Kat, stop that!”


Kat let her hand drop.


40 41


At the bus stop, Kat said, “Beth, this
is the best bus!”


I said, “Why? Is it fast?”


“No,” Kat said, “it is not that fast.”


“Then why is it the best?”


Just then, Kat said, “There it is!”


It was a big red bus with
a top deck!


42 43


Kat and I sat up on the
top deck of the big red
bus.


The bus went past a big
shop.


“That is where Mom
shops,” said Kat. “That
shop has all the best
stuff!”


44 45


The bus went past a big clock. A
bell went ding, dong, ding, dong.


“That is Big Ben!” said Kat.


“Who is Big Ben?” I said.


“Big Ben is not a man,” Kat said.
“Big Ben is the bell that is in that
clock.”


46 47


The bus went on.


“That is a posh spot there!” Kat
said.


“Posh?” I said. “What is that?”


“A posh spot is where stuff costs
a lot,” said Kat. “Mom had lunch in
there once, and it cost so
much that Dad
got mad. ”


48 49


# The Man in the Black Hat

All of us got off the bus. Kat led
us up to a man in a black hat.


“Beth,” Kat said, “that man will
not grin. ”


“Why not?” I said.


“His job is to stand there as still
as a rock and not grin,” Kat said.


50 51


“I will do the best
trick I can,” Kat said.
“But I will bet that
man will not grin. ”


Kat did a trick and
fell on her back.


Kat’s trick got all of
us to grin, but the
man in the black hat
did not grin.


52 53


“I bet I can get him to
grin!” I said.


I did a split, but the
man did not grin.


I sang a song and did
a jig, but still the man
did not grin.


54 55


Mom got lots of snap shots of us
and the man in the black hat.
But there is not one snap shot
where that man grins.


56 57


# The Man in the Kilt

Once Kat and I met a man in
a kilt.


I said, “Why is that man in a
dress?”


Kat said, “That is not a dress.
It is a kilt.”


“A quilt?” I said.


“No,” Kat said. “A kilt.”


58 59


“What is a kilt?” I said.


Mom said, “The kilt tells us that
the man is a Scot. The cloth on
the kilt tells us where the man is
from. ”


“So the kilt tells us his past?” I
said.


“Yes,” said Mom. “It is a bit of his
past.”


Mom got this snap shot of us
with the man in the kilt!


60 61


# The Map

Once all of us were
on a trip when a dog ran
up and bit the map.


Dot said, “Bad dog! Stop that!
Drop that map! Drop it!”


But the dog did not
drop the map. The
dog ran up the block
with the map.


62 63


Kat ran to get the map, but Dot
said, “It is just a map. Let the
dog have it.”


Just then the dog let the map
drop. Kat got it and held it up.


“Here it is,” Kat said. “But it’s got
a big rip in it.”


“Well,” Dot said, “I am just glad
the dog bit the map and not
one of us.”


64 65


# In the Cab

Dot got us a cab.


The cab man said, “Where
to?”


Dot said, “King’s.”


“What is King’s?” I said.


“King’s is a spot to get
lunch,” said Kat.


66 67


“If it is King’s,” I said, “I bet it’s
posh. Will I get to sit with the
king?”


“No,” said Dot with a grin. “But
King’s has got the best fish and
chips!”


The cab man got us to King’s in
a flash. Then all of us went in to
have lunch.


68 69


# The Punt

Dot said, “Let’s rent a punt!”


“A punt?” I said. “What’s that?”


Dot led us to a dock. There
were two punts there, as well as
a man with a long stick.


“Let’s rent one!” I said.


70 71


All of us got in the punt. The
man with the stick got in last.


The man said, “Kids, this punt
can tip. If it tips, all of us will get
wet. The best thing to do is to sit
still and not stand up.”


Kat and I sat still and did not get
wet.


It was a lot of fun.


72 73


# The Trip Back

The trip to the U. K. was so much
fun. I was sad that it had to end.


When it did end, Kat and I had
a hug. So did Mom and Dot.


Then Mom and I got back on
the jet.


74 75


When Mom and I got back to
the U. S., Dad met us.


“Dad!” I said, “I am glad you
are here. I wish you were with
us in the U. K. Mom and I went
on a punt and had fish and
chips at a shop! Kat and I sat on
top of a big red bus and went
past Big Ben! It was the best
trip!”


76 77


I got a map of the U. K. and
hung it up.


I stuck red dots on all the spots
Mom and I went to.


78 79


Mom got prints of the snap shots
from the trip.


I sent the best ones to Kat!

About this Book

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully leveled
in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.

The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many spellings
can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to make early
reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of the available
spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out as part of their
phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been deliberately
introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if they are
assigned at the proper time.

As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.



VOWEL SOUNDS
AND SPELLINGS:


/i/ as in _skim_


/e/ as in _bed_


/a/ as in _tap_


/u/ as in _up_


/o/ as in _flop_



Code Knowledge added gradually in the unit for this Reader:


  - Beginning with “Beth”: Tricky Word _the_


  - Beginning with “The Trip to the U.K.”: /ng/ as in _king_


  - Beginning with “Bud the Cat”: Tricky Word _said_


  - Beginning with “The Fish”: double-letter spellings for consonant sounds, such as ‘ll’, ‘ss’, etc.

and /k/ > ‘ck’ as in _snack_


  - Beginning with “The Flag Shop”: Tricky Word _was_ and /z/ > ‘s’ as in _dogs_


  - Beginning with “Which Is the Best?”: Tricky Word _which_


  - Beginning with “The Bus Stop”: Tricky Words _there_, _why_


  - Beginning with “On the Bus”: Tricky Words _where_, _who_, _what_


  - Beginning with “The Man in the Kilt”: /qu/ as in _quilt_


  - Beginning with “The Map”: Tricky Words _when_, _here_
