When I went to vis·it with Do·ba, I was sad .
I missed Mom and Dad . But Do·ba cheered me
up and made things fun .


Do·ba took me on hikes . The land I saw in
the South·west was not at all like the land I am
used to . Where I am from, things are green in
the summ·er, and there are lots of trees . Out
in the South·west, there are hills and red rocks,
but not a lot of trees . In some spots, you can
hike for a mile and not see one tree!


Once, Do·ba and I were on a hike when it
start·ed to storm . Do·ba and I went in·to a cave
so that we would not get wet .

As we were stand·ing there, I saw
some·thing shimm·er in the dark .


“Do·ba,” I said, point·ing at the spot,
“what’s that?”


“Well,” said Do·ba, “let’s have a look .”


We looked and saw some·thing stuck
in a crack in the rock . I grabbed it .


“It’s a coin!” I said .


“Well, I’ll be!” said Do·ba

I said, “What sort of coin is it?”


Do·ba said, “I can’t tell . It looks like it could
be made of sil·ver .”


Then she said, “I have a pal, Sa·ni, who
is an ex·pert on coins . We can bring it to him
to·morr·ow, and he will tell us what sort of coin
it is .”


I dropped the coin in my pock·et, and we
went on with our hike .

a cave .”


look at it!”

“When was it made?” asked Do·ba


“There’s no date on the coin,” said Sa·ni .
“But I’ll bet it dates back to the six·teen
hun·dreds . The Span·ish mint·ed a big ba **tch** of
coins like this one back then .”


“Good·ness!” said Do·ba .


“Is that a long time back in the past?” I
asked .


“Yes,” said Sa·ni . “Let me run and fe **tch** my
book on Span·ish coins .”


When Sa·ni came back, he said, “There’s
just one thing I need you to tell me, Miss Nez .”



10


11


“What’s that?” I asked .


“Are there a lot of coins like this one in that
cave?”


“No,” I said, “we found just this one .”


“That’s a shame,” Sa·ni said .


“Why?” I asked .


Sa·ni nodd·ed .

like a dime .”


nev·er can tell!”




17


I asked Do·ba, “Who do you think hid the
Span·ish coin?”


“Let’s think,” Do·ba said . “It was on Na·va·jo
land .”


“A Span·ish coin on Na·va·jo land?” I asked .


“We lived on this land before the Span·ish,”
Do·ba said . “The Span·ish came later . They
came looking for gold .”


“Per·haps a Span·ish person lost it here,” I
said . “Did the Na·va·jo then make blue stone
crafts like you do?”


“They did,” Do·ba said .


“Per·haps a Span·ish person traded this
coin for blue stone,” I said .


“Or per·haps a Na·va·jo girl found the coin
and hid it,” Do·ba said . “A Na·va·jo girl like you .”




19


I was sitt·ing in the ki **tch** ·en, scra **tch** ·ing a
lar **ge** bug bite on my leg, when Do·ba came
in . “I just spoke with Sa·ni,” she said . “He made
us an off·er .”


“What sort of off·er?”


“He off·ered to take us camp·ing with him
and Gad .”


“Who is Gad?”


“Gad is nine, like you . Sa·ni is his
grand·dad .”


“What would we do?” I asked .



20


“Well, we would hike, look at rocks, cook
lunch and dinn·er out·side, look at the stars,
and sleep in a tent .”


“ **G** ee,” I said, “that sounds like fun! When
can we start?”


“To·morr·ow morn·ing!” Do·ba said .




Sa·ni came and picked us up in his
truck . We drove for miles to get to the
camp·site .


“Do·ba,” I said, “what is this place?”


“Well,” said Do·ba, “take a look . See all
the sand, rocks, and stones? This land is not
good for farming, but it’s good for hik·ing .”


“And it’s good land for camp·ing!” said
Sa·ni .




23


When we got to the camp·site, we had
to un·pack sleep·ing bags, tents, lan·terns,
ma **tch** ·es, and lots of food . We lugged it all to
the camp·site .


Sa·ni chose a spot to set up camp . Gad
and I helped set up the tents . It took us a
long time .


For dinn·er we had hot dogs . We stuck
them on sticks and held them in the fire. My
hot dog got all black be·cause I left it in there
too long . Gad gave me one of his .


That was when I said to my·self, “Gad is OK!”




25


After din·ner we munched on pine nuts by
the fire.


“Do you know of Spi·der Wo·man?” Sa·ni
asked . “If not, I will tell you of her .”


“Who is Spi·der Wo·man?” I asked .


“Spi·der Wo·man helps the Na·va·jo,” Sa·ni
said . “She showed us how to weave . We
Na·va·jo are ex·pert weav·ers, you know .”


“Like Do·ba!” said Kate .


“Yes,” said Sa·ni . “Did you know that
Na·va·jo weav·ers keep one thread o·pen in
their weav·ing so that the spir·it of the weav·er
does not get trapped in the rug?”


“Now, Spi·der Wo·man,” Sa·ni went on,
“lives on Spi·der Rock—way out there .”



26


27


the sky . It was as big as many hills .


“It is her home,” Sa·ni said . “Spi·der
Wo·man comes in·to man·y old stor·ies . This is
just one .”


“It was one day long ago . A Na·va·jo boy
was looking for food here in the cliffs . Then,
he heard a shout . A bad boy was there! He
wanted to hurt the Na·va·jo boy .”


“No!” said Kate .


“The Na·va·jo boy ran, but there was no
place to hide . He ran all the way to Spi·der
Rock .”


“Wait, he should climb the Rock!” Kate said .
“The bad boy could not ca **tch** him then .”


“Yes,” said Sa·ni . “But the boy was tired .
How would he climb the rock?”




29


“The boy al·so did not know,” said Sa·ni .
“But then, a silk rope made of spi·der web fell!
It came from the top of Spi·der Ro·ck . The boy
had no time to think . He took it in his hand . It
was strong, and with it he could climb . On top,
he was safe .”


Kate looked at Spi·der Ro·ck far off . How
would it feel to climb it on a rope made of
web?


“Did Spi·der Wo·man make the rope?” she
asked .


“That’s what the boy told his Do·ba when
he got home,” Sa·ni said . “What do you think?”


Kate did not say . She ran o·ver the stor·y in
her mind .




“I like that stor·y,” she said at last . Gad
nod·ded, too .


“I am glad,” Sa·ni said . “We Na·va·jo like to
tell stor·ies of Spi·der Wo·man . It’s good you
know one now, too .”




Af·ter tell·ing us the stor·y, Sa·ni said, “It’s
time to pack up the food .”


We stuffed the food in·to a lar **ge** pack with
a rope on it . Sa·ni tossed the rope up in·to a
tree and hoist·ed the food pack up so that it
was hang·ing ten feet off of the ground .


“Paw-paw,” said Gad, “why do we have to
keep the food up in the tree?”


“Be·cau se it will keep the food safe from
fox·es and rabb·its that would like to snack on
it,” Sa·ni said .




33


Af·ter that, we crawled in·to the tents,
flipped off our lan·terns, and went to sleep.


Do·ba and I slept well un·til a loud clatt·er
out·side woke us up .


“What was that?” I asked .


“I can’t tell,” said Do·ba, as she hugged me
close to her .




Sa·ni ran out·side with his lan·tern and
yelled, “Get out of here! Scram! Get lost!”


When we went out, we saw Sa·ni and Gad
stand·ing there . Sa·ni had his lan·tern .


“Sa·ni,” Do·ba asked, “who came to vis·it?”


“I did not see it,” said Sa·ni, “but I’m
bett·ing it was a fox who was look·ing for some
scraps of food . He bumped in·to the pots and
pans . The clatt·er of the pots and pans must
have scared him off .”


“Is that why we hoist·ed the food pack up
in the tree?” Gad asked .


“That’s why!” said Sa·ni .




37


# **The Hike**

The next morn·ing, we went on a hike .
Af·ter a bit, we stopped for lunch .


When Gad fin·ished his lunch, he asked,
“Can Kate and I look for rocks?”


Sa·ni said OK .


“Kate,” Gad said to me, “bring your fork .
We can use it to dig up rocks .”


I grabbed my fork, and we went off to
look for rocks .




39


Gad point·ed at a bump on the side of a
cliff and said, “Let’s dig that rock out!”


The rock did not look all that lar **ge** . But
when we start·ed digg·ing, we soon saw that it
was lar **g** ·er than it had seemed .


Af·ter a bit, Gad said, “ **G** ee! It must be
two feet long! We need to keep scra **tch** ·ing in
or·der to car **ve** it out of the side of the cliff .”


We went on scra **tch** ·ing with our forks .


“Let’s tug on it!” Gad said . “I bet we can
get it out by our·sel **ve** s .”




41


We grabbed and tugged it .


It popped out . But so did a big cloud of
sand and dust . Gad and I fell down .


Once the dust and sand had drift·ed off, I
saw Gad stand·ing there with the thing in his
hands .


“It’s not a rock!” he yelled . “It’s a bone!”


It was the bigg·est bone I had ev·er seen .
It was three feet long!




43


Sa·ni and Do·ba came runn·ing . When she
saw the bone, Do·ba looked up·set .


“Are you OK?” I asked .


She did not say . “Will you tell me, Kate,
where you found that lar **ge** bone?”


I point·ed to the spot where we found it .


“Good·ness!” she said . “It was in the cliff .”


“What is done is done,” said Sa·ni . “Let’s
look at it .”


Sa·ni set the bone on the ground . Then
he took a pic·ture of the bone and said, “We
need to get an ex·pert to look at this bone
and tell us what sort of bone it is .”




45


The next morn·ing, Sa·ni said, “I just had a
chat with a man from West·ern State Coll·e **ge** .
His name is Ron Fi **tch**, and he is an ex·pert
on bones . He has **wr** itt·en lots of books . If we
bring him the bone, he can tell us what sort of
bone it is .”


“He’s a bone man?” asked Gad .


“Yep,” said Sa·ni .


We got in·to the truck . Sa·ni said that I was
in char **ge** of the bone . I **wr** apped it up and
set it on my lap .


When we got to the coll·e **ge**, we gave the
bone man the bone . When he saw it, he broke
in·to a big grin .



46


47


The bone man bent down and said, “I
could be **wr** ong, but it looks like you’ **ve** found
some·thing big here! I have to do some tests,
but I’ll bet this is a bone of a rap·tor .”


“Sweet!” yelled Gad .


“What’s a rap·tor?” I asked .


Gad looked at me like I was from Mars .


“Kate!” he said, “A rap·tor is like the cool·est
rep·tile of all time!”


The bone man went and got a book . He
point·ed to a lar **ge** pic·ture of a rap·tor .




49


Sa·ni .


of the cliff!”


cool .




# **Two Good Things and** **One Bad Thing**

The next week, Do·ba said, “I just spoke
with Ron Fi **tch**, the bone man . I’ **ve** got three
things to tell you . Two of them are good things
that you will like . One is a bad thing that you
will not like .”


“Tell me one of the good things,” I said .


“Mis·ter Fi **tch** got the tests back . The bone
that you and Gad found is a rap·tor bone!”


“Yipp·ee!” I shout·ed . “I am glad that is
sol **ve** d . Gad will be so thrilled that he has a
rap·tor bone!”


“Well,” said Do·ba, “that brings me to the
bad thing .”



52


53


“What is it?” I asked, scra **tch** ·ing my **wr** ist .


“The bad thing is that you and Gad will not
get to keep the bone for your·sel **ve** s .”


“Why not? Did we do some·thing **wr** ong?”


“There is a law that says that you can’t
dig up bones and keep them for your·self,”
Do·ba said . “We Na·va·jo say the bone should
have stayed in the ground . It be·longs to no
one . But now that it is out, Mis·ter Fi **tch** and his
hel·pers will keep them safe for us .”


I felt bad . “Sorr·y I dug up the bone,” I
said .


Do·ba smiled at me . “You did not know
bett·er . You do now . May I tell you the sec·ond
good thing?”




“Tell me!”


“They would like you and Gad to vis·it them
when they are digg·ing up the bones . And
they would like the two of you to pick out a
name for the rap·tor that you found .”


“Cool!” I said .



55


When we went back to the cliff, the bone
man was there with some help·ers . They had
scraped the side of the cliff to ex·pose a lot of
the rap·tor .


“So, will you dig out all of the bones here on
site?” asked Do·ba .


“No,” said the bone man, “the next step will
be to car **ve** this cliff in·to lar **ge** blocks of rock .
Then we will **wr** ap the blocks up in plas·ter .
The plas·ter will keep the bones from crack·ing .
Then we will use a lar **ge** crane to set the blocks
on trucks . Then the trucks will take them to my
lab . Once the blocks are there, we will start
digg·ing the bones out of the blocks .”



56


57


“What sort of tools do you use for that?”
asked Do·ba


“We use tools a lot like the ones den·tists use
on teeth—brush·es and sharp picks .”


“Kate and I used forks!” said Gad .


“How long will it take to car **ve** all of the
bones out of the rocks?” Sa·ni asked .


“Well,” said the bone man, “we’ **ve** got a lot
to do . It will take some time be·cau se we have
to be care·ful not to **wr** eck the bones .”


“Will you be fin·ished by the end of the
summ·er?” I asked .


“No,” said the bone man, “you and Gad will
have to vis·it next summ·er and per·haps the
summ·er af·ter that . Then we can ca **tch** up on
our digg·ing prog·ress!”



58


59


“So,” said the bone man, “have you
picked out a name for this rap·tor?”


“Yes, I’ **ve** picked one,” I said .


All of the digg·ers stopped digg·ing
and looked at me .


I said, “This rap·tor will be named
Gad!”


All of the men cheered .


Gad smiled .



60


61


Af·ter we named the rap·tor, some men
came char **g** ·ing up to us .


“Can we shoot some film of you for TV?”
one of them asked . “It would be a big scoop
for us .”


Do·ba and Sa·ni said it was OK .




63


The men set up a bunch of stuff to shoot
the film. Then one of them start·ed count·ing
down from ten . He said, “Three, two, one!” Then
he point·ed at us .


The TV man spoke in·to a mike . He said,
“This is Ro **g** ·er Fle **tch** ·er . I’m stand·ing here on
the site where two chil·dren have found the
bones of a rap·tor .”




65


The man bent down to Gad and stuck the
mike un·der his nose . He said, “What’s your
name?”


Gad looked like he was scared of the mike .
He jumped back a bit . Then he mutt·ered, “I’m
Gad .”


“And you?”


I said, “I’m Kate .” Then I waved .


“Gad,” said the man, “where did you spot
the bone?”


Gad said, “It was stick·ing out of the side of
a cliff .”




“Kate, could you tell it was a bone when you
saw it?”


“No,” I said, “it looked like a rock .”


“What did you use to dig it out?”


“We used our forks!” said Gad .


“Forks!” said the man . “That’s cool . Could
I get a close-up of the two of you with your
forks?”


Some·one ran and got us two forks . We
held them up and smiled un·til the man said,
“Cut!” And that was the end of that .




We drove back to Do·ba’s cab·in and got
there just in time to see our·sel **ve** s on TV .


The TV man said, “This is Ro **g** ·er Fle **tch** ·er .
I’m stand·ing here on the site where two
children have found the bones of a rap·tor .”


Then Gad and I saw our·sel **ve** s on TV .


“Woo-hoo!” I shout·ed . “We are TV stars!”


Then came the part where the TV man
asked Gad his name, and Gad looked like he
was scared of the mike .


“Gad, you goof!” I said . “Why did you jump
back like that?”


Gad just shrugged .



70


71


Next the TV man asked me my name .


I said, “I’m Kate .” Then I waved .


“Gad,” said the TV man, “where did you
spot the bone?”


Gad said, “It was stick·ing out of the side of
a cliff .”


“What did you use to dig it out?”


“We used our forks!” said Gad .


Then we saw the close-up of Gad and me
with our forks .


“So there you have it!” said the TV man .
“I’m Ro **g** ·er Fle **tch** ·er with a tale of two
chil·dren, two forks, and one lar **ge** rap·tor!”




73


Gad and I and the rap·tor were on TV
six times . I was glad when it came to an end .
Af·ter you smile and wave a fork six times, it
gets to be less fun .


One morn·ing, Do·ba hand·ed me a book
and said, “Let’s drive to the book shop .”


“Do·ba,” I said, “why do you need to get
a book at the book shop when you have this
one?”


“I just fin·ished that one,” Do·ba said . “I liked
it a lot . And it just so happ·ens that the man
who **wr** ote it will be at the book shop to·day .
I’d like to meet him .”



74


75


In the car I looked at the book . It said
“Dust Up, by Si·mon Chee .”


“What sort of book is this?” I asked .


“It’s a book by a Na·va·jo man,” said Do·ba .
“His name is Si·mon Chee .”


“What does he **wr** ite on?”


“Pa·per,” smiled Do·ba


“Do·ba!”


“Just a joke,” said Do·ba . “Si·mon Chee
**wr** ites down old stor·ies of the Na·va·jo .”



76


“Like the stor·y of Spi·der Wo·man Sa·ni
told me?”


“Yes!” Do·ba said . “And about the Na·va·jo
today, too . Not just in the past .”


I looked at the last pa **g** e and saw the
pa **g** e num·ber: 305 .


“Yikes!” I said . “This is a long book!”


“It is,” said Do·ba . “But it felt short to me
be·cause I liked it so much . I was sad when I
got to the end!”


I start·ed to look in·side the book, but just
then Do·ba said, “Here we are!”



77


# **The Book Shop**

In the book shop, there
was a big stack of books . Next
to the books sat Si·mon Chee,
the man who **wr** ote the books .
He had a pen in his hand and
a big smile on his lips .


“You’d smile too if your
book were sell·ing as well as
his is!” Do·ba said .


Do·ba and I went and
stood in line to meet Si·mon
Chee .



78


Do·ba shook hands with him and said, “I’ **ve**
got twel **ve** of your books . This one was your
best book yet!”


The man smiled and said, “That’s sweet of
you! I hope you will pick up my next one, too!”


“I will!” said Do·ba .


Then the man **wr** ote, “Best wish·es, Si·mon
Chee,” in Do·ba’s book .


“Mis·ter Chee,” I asked, “how hard was it to
**wr** ite that book?”


“Well,” he said, “this one was not all that
hard . The last one I did was a lot hard·er .”


As we got back in the car, I said, “Do·ba,
I’d like to **wr** ite a book .”




“What sort of book would it be?” Do·ba
asked .


“Well,” I said, “Gad and I found the rap·tor .”


“Yes, you did,” said Do·ba


“And you and I found that coin .”


“Yes,” said Do·ba .


“So it could be a book a·bout all of that .”


“Why not?” said Do·ba . “If you **wr** ite it, I will
make the pic·tures .”


I said, “Shake on it!” Then we shook hands .




81


When we got back to Do·ba’s, I start·ed
to **wr** ite the book . I **wr** ote down all of the
cool stuff that happ·ened to me out West . The
hard·est part was gett·ing start·ed . Once I got
started, it went fast .


Do·ba helped me pick out good words .
Some·times when you **wr** ite, you have to **wr** ite
things two or three times to get all of the best
words and get them in the best or·der .


Gad helped me out, too . He said, “I can
help you with spell·ing . I am the best spell·er in
my class .” Gad looked at what I had **wr** itt·en
and fixed a lot of spell·ing mis·takes that I had
made .



82


83


When I had **wr** itt·en the words, Do·ba got
out her brush and start·ed to make the art . It
took her a long time . She sent the pic·tures to
me three weeks af·ter I went home .


My dad took me and my book to a pal of
his to see if he would pub·lish the book .


The man looked at it and said, “This is well**wr** itt·en! Chil·dren out there will like this book .
I’d like to print it!”


I was so glad, I shout·ed, “Yipp·ee!”




85


The man and his staff got the book all set to
pub·lish . Then they sent it to a print·er .


I hope you liked the book .


If you’d like to **wr** ite me a lett·er, you can
send it to me at this add·ress:

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully
leveled in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.

The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many spellings
can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to make early
reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of the available
spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out as part of their
phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been deliberately
introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if they are
assigned at the proper time.

As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.
