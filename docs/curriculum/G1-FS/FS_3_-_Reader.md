# **The King Frog** **and the Big Ox**

**Adapted from: The Frog and the Ox (Aesop’s Fables)**


A big ox came to a c **oo** l p **oo** l for
a sip.

“Sip, sip, sip,” went the big ox.


The big ox made a step in the p **oo** l.

He sat in the c **oo** l p **oo** l to make
his feet c **oo** l, too.



2


### When he sat in the p oo l, he made a big splash!



3


“Squish, splash! Squish, splash!”
went the big ox in the c **oo** l p **oo** l.


When the big ox sat back, he hit
the King Frog.

King Frog was in the mud and
the big ox hit him with a thud!


One of his big feet sat on top of
the King Frog.

The King Frog was stuck deep in
the mud.

big ox.

“Was the ox as big as this?” said
the small frog.



6


All the frogs said, “No, he was big,
BIG!”

“Was he this big?” The small frog
made two puffs.



7


All the frogs said, “No, the ox
was big, big, BIG!”

“This big?” The small frog gave
a puff, puff, PUFF!

9


The ox came from the c **oo** l p **oo** l.
His big sips came to a stop. He sat
on the green grass to rest his big,
wet feet.


The King Frog sat up from the
mud in the c **oo** l p **oo** l. He said, “That
ox was this big!”

# **The Two Dogs**

Once two dogs met. One of
them was a tame dog who made
his home with men. One was a
dog who ran free.


The dog who ran free stared
at the tame dog and said, “Why is
it that you are so plump and I am
so thin?”



12


13


“Well,” said the tame dog, “I am
plump becau se the men feed me.
I do not have to run all the time
to get my f **oo** d. My job is to keep
the home safe when the men are
in their beds. When they wake up,
they feed me scraps of f **oo** d from
their plates.”



14


“Your life must be a fine life,” said
the thin dog. “I wish my life were like
yours.”


The plump dog said, “If you will
help me keep the home safe, I bet
the men will feed you, t **oo** .”


“I will do it!” said the thin dog.



16


17


But just as the thin dog said this,
the m **oo** n shone on the neck of the
plump dog.


The thin dog said, “What is that
on your neck?”


“I am on a rope when the sun is
up,” said the plump dog.


“Rope?” said the thin dog. “Do
they keep you on a rope?”



18


19


“Yes,” said the plump dog. “When
the m **oo** n is up, the men let me free,
but when the sun shines, they keep
me on a rope. I can not run and be
free when the sun is up, but it is not
so bad.”



20


21


“No, no!” said the thin dog,
as he ran off. “I will not have a
rope on my neck. You can be
plump. I will be free!”



22


23


# **The Hares and the Frogs**

Three hares st **oo** d in the grass.


“I am sad,” one of them said. “I
wish we were brave.”


“So do I,” said the next one. “But
we are not brave. A splash in the
br **oo** k scares us. The wind in the
grass scares us. We are scared all
the time.”


“Yes,” said the last one. “It is sad
to be a hare.”



24


25


Just then there was a splash in
the br **oo** k. The splash scared the
hares. They ran off to hide. As they
ran, they scared a bunch of frogs.


“L **oo** k,” said one of the hares.
“The frogs are scared of us!”


“Yes, they are!” said the next
hare. “They are scared of us! Well,
I’m glad I am not a frog!”


“Yes!” said the last hare. “In the
end, it is g **oo** d to be a hare!”



26


27


# **The Two Mules**

Once a man went on a trip
with two mules. He set five packs
on one mule and five packs on the
next one.


The black mule was strong. The
mule with spots was not as strong,
and by n **oo** n, he was tired. The
mule with the spots felt the packs
press on his back and he could not
keep up with the black mule.



28


29
29


The mule with the spots spoke to
the black mule. “I hate to ask,” he
said, “but would you help me with
my packs?”


The black mule did not stop to
help the mule with spots.


“I have my five packs and you
have your five,” he said.



30


31


long as he could. At last, he fell and
could not get up.


The man set all ten of the packs
on the black mule.


“What a f **oo** l I was!” the black
mule said. “I did not help the mule
with spots when I should have. If I
had, I would not have to lift all of his
packs as well as mine.”



32


33


# **The Dog and the Mule**

Once there was a man who had
a dog and a mule. The man gave
the dog scraps of f **oo** d from his
plate. He let the dog lick his sp **oo** n.
The dog would sit on the man’s lap
and lick him. The man would rub the
dog and kiss him.



34


35


The mule would l **oo** k in and
see the dog on the man’s lap. He
felt sad. He felt left **ou** t.


“The man feeds me,” said
the mule, “but I do not get
f **oo** d from his plate. I’m left **ou** t
becau se I am a mule. I should
act like a dog. If I do that, the
man will like me just as much as
he likes the dog.”



36


37


So the mule left his pen and
went in the man’s home. He set
his feet on the man’s lap and
gave the man a big, wet lick.


The man was scared. He gave
a sh **ou** t and let his plate drop. It
broke with a crash. The man fell
down, t **oo** .


When the man got up, he was
mad at the mule. He made the
mule run back **ou** t to his pen.



38


39


# **The Bag of Coins**

Once two men went on a trip.
One of them f **ou** nd a bag of c **oi** ns
on the gr **ou** nd, at the f **oo** t of a
tree.


“L **oo** k what I f **ou** nd!” he said.
“It is a bag of c **oi** ns!”



40


41


c **oi** ns. They are my c **oi** ns. I f **ou** nd
them. They are all mine!”



42


43


### There were a bunch of men and they were mad. “L oo k!” they sh ou ted. “There is a man with the bag. He stole ou r c oi ns!” “Get him!” said the rest.



44


45
45


### The man with the c oi ns was scared. “Those men are mad,” he said. “If they see us with the c oi ns, we will be in a bad spot.” “No, no,” said the man next to him. “If they see you, you will be in a bad spot. Those are not ou r c oi ns. Those are y our c oi ns. You f ou nd them. They are all y ours.”




47


# **The Dog and the Ox**

Once a dog t **oo** k a nap on a pile
of stuff in a box. “That str **aw** l **oo** ks
g **oo** d for sleeping,” said the dog. But
it was not str **aw** in the box. The box
was not a bed.


When the ox came home, he s **aw**
the dog in his f **oo** d box. But he could
not get to the f **oo** d becau se the
dog was on top of it.



48


49


“Dog,” said the ox, “There is str **aw**
in the loft. Could you sleep up in the
loft? I would like to munch on the
f **oo** d in my box.”


The dog woke up, but he would
not get off the f **oo** d box. He was
mad that the ox woke him up.



50


51


At last, a man came in and s **aw**
the dog on the f **oo** d box.


“Bad dog!” said the man. “That
box is not a bed. It has f **oo** d for the
ox, but you would not let him have it!
Shame on you! Get up! You should
sleep on the str **aw** in the loft.”



52


53


# **The Fox and the** **Grapes**

A fox s **aw** a bunch of ripe
grapes that hung from the
branch of a tree.


The fox said, “Those grapes
l **oo** k g **oo** d. I will get them and
make them my lunch.”


The fox st **oo** d up on his back
legs, but he could not grab the
grapes.



54


55


The fox made a hop, but he
could not grab the grapes.


The fox ran and made a big
jump, but he still could not get the
grapes.


At last, the fox sat down on the
gr **ou** nd.


“What a f **oo** l I am!” said the fox.
“I can tell that those grapes are
s **ou** r. They would not have made a
g **oo** d lunch.”



56


57


# **The Fox and the Hen**

A hen sat in a tree. A red fox ran
up to the tree.


“Did they tell you?” said the fox.


“Tell me what?” said the hen.



58


59


“They have made a l **aw**,” said the
fox. “The l **aw** says that we must all
be pals. Dogs are not to chase cats.
They must be pals. Cats are not to
chase rats. They must be pals. Dog
and cat, fox and hen, snake and rat
must all be pals! So jump down here
and let me hug you!”



60


61


“Well, that s **ou** nds swell!” said the
hen. “But, all the same, I will sit up
here a bit.”


Then the hen said, “What’s that I
see?”


“Where?” said the fox. “What is
it?”


“It l **oo** ks like a pack of dogs,” said
the hen.


“Dogs!” said the fox. “Then I must
get **ou** t of here!”



62


63


“Stop!” said the hen. “The l **aw**
says that dog and fox must be pals.
So you are safe!”


But the fox did not stop. He ran
off.


The hen just smiled.



64


65


# **The Fox and the Crane**

The fox s **aw** the crane and said,
“Crane, will you have lunch with
me?”


The crane said, “I will.”


The crane came and sat down
with the fox in his den.


The fox was up to a trick. He
gave the crane some f **oo** d, but he
gave it to him in a flat stone dish.
The crane could not get the f **oo** d
becau se of the shape of his bill. The
fox smiled at his trick. He ate up all
of his f **oo** d.



66


67


The next week the crane s **aw**
the fox and said, “Fox, will you have
lunch with me?”


The fox said, “That would be
g **oo** d. I will.”


This time the crane was up to a
trick. He gave the fox milk, but he
gave it to him in a glass with a long,
thin neck. The fox could not get the
milk becau se of the shape of his
nose.

# **The Tree and the** **Reeds**

A pr **ou** d tree st **oo** d next to
a grove of reeds. When a gust
of wind came, the reeds bent
in the wind. But the pr **ou** d tree
did not bend at all. It st **oo** d up
to the wind.



70


71


“It is t **oo** bad that you can’t
stand up to the wind as I can!” said
the tree to the reeds.


“We bend so that we will not
crack,” said the reeds.


“There is no wind that can crack
me!” said the tree in its pride.


“We shall see!” said the reeds.



72


73


The next week a big wind
came. The tree was brave. It
st **oo** d up a long time. But the
gusts of wind were t **oo** strong. At
last, there was a l **ou** d crack. The
tree fell with a crash.


The reeds bent in the strong
wind, but they did not crack. They
still stand by the br **oo** k. You can
see them wave in the wind next
to the r **oo** ts of the tree.



74


75


# **The Moon**

The m **oo** n said, “I wish I had a
dress. Mom, will you make me a
dress?”


The m **oo** n’s mom said, “I will not
make you a dress, my sweet.”



76


77


“Why not?” said the m **oo** n.


“Becau se you wax and you
wane,” said the m **oo** n’s mom. “One
week you are big and r **ou** nd. The
next week you are thin. One week
you are all there. The next week
there is just a bit of you. No one
can make a dress that will fit you
in all of your shapes!”

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully leveled
in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.


The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many spellings
can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to make early
reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of the available
spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out as part of their
phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been deliberately
introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if they are
assigned at the proper time.


As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.
