# **Welcome!**
## Grade 1, Unit 3 Foundational Skills

Dear Family Member,

In this unit, students will learn an additional five new vowel sounds and the common spellings for those sounds.

They will also focus on verb identification, verb tense, and narrative writing.


**What** **will** **my** **student** **learn?**


Students will learn the following vowel sounds and the spellings for each sound: /oo/ spelled ‘oo’, as in _soon_ ; /oo/

spelled ‘oo’, as in _look_ ; /ou/ spelled ‘ou’, as in _shout_ ; /oi/ spelled ‘oi’, as in _oil_ ; and /aw/ spelled ‘aw’, as in _paw_ . Students

will practice their newly learned skills of letter-sound relationships, including letter patterns, to correctly pronounce

written words while reading stories from the Reader _Fables_, which are special types of stories that teach important

lessons or morals. They will also practice identifying whether a verb represents an action that is happening in the

present or one that happened in the past. Additionally, students will write a simple narrative that retells the text,

and they will write a book report in which they are encouraged to include their opinions.
