**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 4. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. The activity pages in this book do not
always include written instructions for students because the instructions would have words that are
not decodable. Teachers will explain these activity pages to the students orally, using the instructions
in the Teacher Guide. The Activity Book is a student component, which means each student should
have an Activity Book.

Today our class started Unit 4 of the program. The Reader for this unit is called _The Green Fern_
_Zoo_ . Your student will bring home stories you can read together about zoo keeper Vern and the
different types of animals he cares for at the Green Fern Zoo. Remember that reading at home
with your student is important for their success as a reader.


In addition, your student’s spelling words for this week include the days of the week. Students
will practice writing the date, including the days of the week. All of the spelling words this week
are Tricky Words. Tricky Words do not play by the rules, meaning there are spellings that do not
sound the way students would expect them to. These words need to be memorized, so your
student will benefit from practice reading and writing them at home.

Dear Family Member,


Your student has been taught to read words with the vowel digraph, or letter team, ‘er’ as in _her_ .
To practice this new spelling, ask your student to cut out the word cards below. In addition to the
‘er’ spelling, some of the words below are Tricky Words and previously taught spellings. Have your
student read all of the words aloud, and arrange the cards to make phrases such as _the herd_ and
_clerk_ . You may also ask your student to copy the phrases onto a sheet of paper. Please keep the
cards for future practice.

This is a chapter your student has read at school. Encourage your student to read the chapter
to you and then talk about it together. The tricky parts in Tricky Words are underlined. Please
note that the multisyllable words that students encounter in the Readers and Activity Book will
be divided between syllables with a dot. This dot serves as an early cue to assist students in
chunking words and will be omitted in later units.


Repeated oral reading is an important way to improve reading skills. It can be fun for your
student to repeatedly read this story to a friend, relative, or even a pet.

**Things that Swim**


I hope you kids like things that
swim, be·cause this is the room
where we keep all the fish.


**Trout**



The fish here are trout. A
trout is a fish that swims in cool
lakes and creeks. You can see
that they have lots of spots and
m **ar** ks. The spots and m **ar** ks help
the trout hide. They make the
trout look a lot like the sand on
the bed of a creek.


Foundational Skills 4



Trout have spots and marks.


The spots help trout hide.



**39**


**Reef Sharks**

Here’s a big fish that makes all
of the wee fish run and hide. This
is a reef sh **ar** k. It has that name
be·cause it likes to make its home
close to a reef, where there are
lots of fish.


_**What Reef Sharks Look Like**_

You can see that the reef sh **ar** k
has fins and a set of gills on its side.
You can not see them from here,
but this sh **ar** k has lots of sh **ar** p
teeth in its mouth.


_**Food Reef Sharks Like**_

Would a reef sh **ar** k bite you?
Well, you are not the lunch that this
sh **ar** k would like best. A reef sh **ar** k
likes to feed on squid, crabs, and
shrimp. But it would be sm **ar** t not to
get the reef sh **ar** k mad at you all
the same!

**Food Chimps Like**

The one you see here is Bess. She
has a snack in her mouth. Bess and
the rest of the chimps like to munch
on plants, nuts, and seeds.


**More Food Chimps Like**

Do you see that chimp with the stick?
That’s B **ar** t. B **ar** t likes to have ants f **or**
lunch. To get the ants, he takes a stick
and sticks it in an ant hill. Then he lifts it

Max is a lot of fun. He likes to
swing on the rope and splash in
the pool.


**Carl and Norm—Pals or Not Pals?**

The two chimps up on the
rocks are C **ar** l and N **or** m. C **ar** l
is the one on the left. C **ar** l and
N **or** m are pals. But they were not
pals last week.


Last week we gave them a
branch from a fig tree f **or** lunch.
N **or** m took the branch and ran
off with it. He ate all of the figs.
C **ar** l was mad at N **or** m all week.


But that was last week. This week

a word that shows action. Please note that the number of nouns in each sentence is listed in
parentheses. For the part on the back, have your student draw a line to match the words with

The spelling words for this week are two-syllable words that end in ‘ed’. Your student can practice
reading and writing these words, as well as clap the syllables for them. The last spelling word is a
Tricky Word. Tricky Words do not play by the rules, meaning there are spellings that do not sound
the way students would expect them to. These words need to be memorized.

note that the multisyllable words are divided between syllables with a dot. This dot serves as a
cue to assist students in chunking syllables and will be omitted in later units.

wings.


**Puffins**



This is a puff·in. He makes his

the N **or** th Pole.


_**What Puffins Look Like**_

_**How Puffins Are Born**_

Puff·ins are b **or** n from eggs. The
puff·in mom and dad sit on their
egg. The mom sits. Then the dad
sits. In the end, the chick pops out
of the shell. The mom and dad
take care of the chick un·til it can

has fish in h **er** bill! She will feed
those fish to h **er** chick.


**The Finch**

In this next room, we have a
finch. Un·like the puff·in, the finch
makes a home in wood·lands. He
can use his bill to snap up grass
seeds f **or** food.


I’m sad to tell you that the
finch is gett·ing to be quite rare.
We are proud to have five of
them here at the Green F **er** n Zoo.

Dear Family Member,



**Take-Home**



This is a chapter your student has read at school. Encourage your student to read the chapter to
you and then talk about it together. The tricky parts in Tricky Words are underlined. Please note
that the multisyllable words are divided between syllables with a dot. This dot serves as a cue to
assist students in chunking syllables and will be omitted in later units.


Repeated oral reading is an important way to improve reading skills. It can be fun for your
student to repeatedly read this story to a friend, relative, or even a pet.


**Groundhogs**


**What Groundhogs Look Like**
Here you can see a ground·hog.


Ground·hogs have sh **ar** p claws
that help them dig holes in the
ground. They spend a lot of time
down in those d **ar** k holes.


**Food Groundhogs Like**

Ground·hogs like to feed on grass
and plants. But when they run out of
their holes to get food, they have to
be on the look·out. Some critt· **er** s,
like bob·cats and snakes, like to dine
on ground·hogs. This ground·hog
here is sitt·ing up to see if there is
a snake **or** a bob·cat close by.


Foundational Skills 4

**More Food Groundhogs Like**


This ground·hog is named
Pepp· **er** . We f **ee** d h **er** grass,
tree b **ar** k, and in·sects, but the
food that she likes best is c **or** n.
We found that out yes·t **er** ·day
m **or** n·ing when she got out from
h **er** pen.


We found h **er** in the pett·ing
zoo. She ate a lot of the c **or** n
that was there f **or** the ducks and
hens.

**Termites**


**Food Termites Like**

What do you kids like to have f **or**
lunch? Hot dogs? Chick·en nugg·ets?


What if I gave you a lump of
wood **or** a big tree stump f **or**
lunch? Would you like that?


Well, if you were a t **er** ·mite, you
would like it. T **er** ·mites are in·sects
that like to munch on wood.


**A Termite Home**

See this big spike stick·ing up from
the ground? It looks s **or** t of like a

rock, but it is a t **er** ·mite mound. If you
could look in·side, you would see lots of
t **er** ·mites.


**What Termites Look Like**

If you would like to see what t **er** ·mites
look like, take a peek in this box.


As you can see, **ter** ·mites look a lot
like ants. They have six legs like ants.
A **ter** ·mite mound has a queen who
makes eggs, just like in an ant·hill. Here
you can see that the **ter** ·mite queen
is much bigg· **er** than the rest of the
**ter** ·mites.


Would a t **er** ·mite munch on your
home? It would if your home is made
of wood. The t **er** ·mites from a big
mound could have your liv·ing room f **or**
lunch and your bed·room f **or** dinn· **er** !
