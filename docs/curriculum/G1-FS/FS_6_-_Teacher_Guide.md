**Grade 1 | Foundational Skills 6**
Introduction


~~**SKILLS 6 OVERVIEW**~~


**Spelling Alternatives**


In this unit you will continue the work you began in the last unit by introducing or reviewing a
number of spelling alternatives for consonant sounds.


Here are the sounds and spellings that are either reviewed or introduced in this unit:


  - /s/ spelled ‘s’, ‘ss’ (review); **‘c’, ‘ce’,** and **‘se’ (new)**


  - /z/ spelled ‘z’, ‘s’, ‘zz’ (review)


  - /m/ spelled ‘m’ and ‘mm’ (review)


  - /n/ spelled ‘n’, ‘nn’ (review), and **‘kn’ (new)**


  - /ng/ spelled ‘ng’ (review) and **‘n’ (new)**


  - /w/ spelled ‘w’ (review) and **‘wh’ (new)**


Note that, as was the case in the last unit, several of the spellings covered in this unit are review
items. There is actually relatively little new code knowledge taught in this unit.


Note also that the sounds have once again been arranged by place of articulation so that the sister
sounds /s/ and /z/ are taught consecutively and the three nasal sounds (/m/, /n/, /ng/) are taught in
close succession. This may be helpful because these are the sounds students are most likely to confuse.


In this unit students will also learn that the spelling ‘c’ stands for /k/ as in _cat_ or /s/ as in _cent_,
and the spelling ‘n’ stands for /n/ as in _nap_ or /ng/ as in _pink_ . Both ‘c’ and ‘n’ are tricky spellings
because they stand for more than one sound.


**Spelling Alternatives Lessons and Tricky Spelling Lessons**


Most of the lessons in this unit are devoted to introducing common spelling alternatives for sounds
that students already know. Several lessons are tricky spelling lessons in which students will learn
to use probability strategies and context clues to self-correct their reading of words that contain
the ambiguous spellings ‘n’, ‘c’, and ‘g’. Decoding and encoding are taught as connected processes.
In Spelling Alternative lessons the primary direction is from sound to print, reviewing sounds, and
introducing new spellings. In Tricky Spelling lessons the primary direction is from print to sound,
reading words, and determining the pronunciation of ‘c’, ‘n’, or ‘g’.


Introduction
**1**


**2**



**Warm-Ups**


Some Warm-Ups in this unit review grammar concepts; the specific concepts and skills are
described in detail in the Grammar section.


In addition, students will continue to orally practice letter-sound correspondences using the
Individual Code Chart. Please choose the spellings that students need to practice the most.


Other Warm-Ups provide students the opportunity to review segmenting and blending two-syllable
words using the three-step method of blending/segmenting one syllable at a time.


There are a few lessons in this unit that do not have a Warm-Up (e.g., the writing lessons and
spelling lessons).


**Tricky Words**


You will introduce one Tricky Word for this unit: _cow_ . Students may be able to read this word on their
own when they recognize it looks similar to the previously taught tricky word _how_ .


**Decodable Reader:** _**Grace**_


The Reader for this unit is called _Grace_, and is about a girl named Grace who lives on a farm in the
Midwest. The stories in this Reader take students through Grace’s daily life on the farm and in
the country.


The stories in this Reader are a bit longer, on average, than the stories in the previous Reader. Many
students will be ready for slightly longer stories as they begin to read more fluently. If you have very slow
readers, they may not be able to do repeated readings of all the stories. You may wish to have slower
readers read only some of the stories in the Reader, allowing them more time to spend on each story.
This kind of picking and choosing will work well for this Reader since it is a collection of stories rather
than a continuous narrative that carries on through a whole series of stories. Almost all of the stories in
the Reader can stand alone. Please note that there is not always a new story in each lesson.


The stories in this Reader are printed in a new font. Up to this point, all student materials have been
printed in a font that was selected because it looks a lot like the letters students are being taught
to write and that features the single-story ‘a’ and single-story ‘g’. Beginning in this Reader, the font
has the double-story ‘a’ and double-story ‘g’. The new font is more like the fonts students will see in
most trade books. In addition, the dot marking the division of syllables is removed. Should students
need help reading multisyllable words, remind them that each syllable may have several consonant
sounds, but it will only have one vowel sound. You may review how to clap the syllables of a word,
and the three-step method for reading multisyllable words: they should first sound and blend the
spellings in the first syllable, then sound and blend the spellings in the second syllable, and then put
them together.


Foundational Skills 6


Note that there is no Big Book for this unit. If you feel that you need to demonstrate the stories to
students, you can use the images found in the digital components in the program’s online materials
for this Reader. You should continue to observe student performance, monitoring as many individual
students or reading groups as possible. Each story is accompanied by a set of discussion questions
in the Teacher Guide. Please discuss these questions with students orally and encourage them to
answer in complete sentences.


**Story Questions Activity Pages**


A Story Questions Activity Page is included for each story in the Reader. Most of these can be done
as part of the main lesson.


**Grammar**

In this unit, grammar concepts and skills are reviewed in many of the Warm-Ups. One such WarmUp is building phrases with adjectives. In this Warm-Up you will model adding three adjectives to a
noun, one at a time, with the goal of creating specific and concrete mental images. For example, you
will say the word _ball_, then the phrase _red ball_, then the phrase _round, red ball_, and finally the phrase
_big, round, red ball_ . Encourage students to create mental images of these phrases.


Students will also practice identifying nouns, verb tenses and expanding sentences by adding
prepositions to provide more detail in other Warm-Ups.


The grammar lessons in this unit address nouns and pronouns. You will introduce the pronouns _he_,
_she, it, we, they, I_, and _you_ . Students have been reading these words for many weeks, but at this
point they will learn to match pronouns to the nouns to which they refer and vice versa.


**Spelling**

Weekly spelling lists and assessments continue in this unit. The spelling lists continue to be made
up of words with letter-sound correspondences that students have already been introduced to in
reading.


Students will also create a Dictation Journal that focuses on spelling words in isolation as well as
in sentences. Spelling assessments will incorporate a phrase or sentence that students must spell
correctly.


  - For the dictation journal, you can either have students use a journal they use for other writing
activities or you may wish to create a small dictation journal for each student. Stapling five pieces of
paper together is all you will need for each journal. (1)


~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit you will introduce students to personal narratives. Students first explore the writing genre
through excerpts of personal narratives. You will then work together with the class to plan and draft a class
personal narrative of a shared class experience, such as a recent class field trip or school assembly.


Introduction
**3**


**4**



A three-stage writing process is used in these lessons. First students plan, then they draft, and
then they edit. You will be asked to draw attention to these steps as students work on these and
subsequent kinds of writing. You are encouraged to have students publish their work using digital
resources, as those resources are available.


**Left-Handed Handwriting Guidance**

 - Consider your seating arrangement for left-handed students. The placement of the arms and elbows
in relation to other students can impact their writing space.


 - Encourage your students to hold their writing tools correctly to reduce hand strain. Allow time for
students to develop their hand strength in writing.


 - Providing pencil grips for students could alleviate the strain on their hands when writing.


 - Orienting the paper at an angle can help left-handed students write more easily and comfortably.
Consider using paper with a raised line for students to rest their hands on as they write.


~~**UNIT 6 ASSESSMENT**~~


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


In addition to the weekly spelling assessments, formative assessments are clearly marked for
monitoring individual student performance and progress in key skills throughout this unit. You will
be prompted to collect activity pages to monitor student progress in reading and writing the spelling
alternatives for /s/, /n/, /w/, and /ng/, and the tricky spellings ‘c’, ‘n’, and ‘g’. You will also collect
activity pages on which students are asked to apply the grammar and writing skills taught in this
unit. Quick “Checks for Understanding” to evaluate classroom performance as a whole are also
designated in various lessons.


In addition, it is recommended that you continue using the Anecdotal Reading Record and
Discussion Questions Observation Record found in the Teacher Resources section at the end of
this Teacher Guide, as well as the Story Questions Activity Pages. You should circulate and listen
to students read, making notes as you listen. You should strive to hear every student read aloud at
least once or twice
a week.


Careful attention to this information, collected on a daily basis, will enable teachers to quickly
determine which students may benefit from reteaching and/or more practice in particular skills,
using the Additional Support activities found at the end of each lesson.


Foundational Skills 6


**Student Performance Assessment**


The first end-of-unit assessment, in Lesson 24, assesses students’ ability to read individual words
that contain the spellings taught in this unit. This is a Word Recognition Assessment that allows
you to assess students all at once. Students who score lower than 8 out of 10 probably need more
practice with the spellings covered in this unit. You are encouraged to analyze students’ responses,
noting which spellings still seem to be difficult for particular students or groups of students. Based
on this information, group students and plan exercises that you will use to remediate.


The second assessment, in Lesson 25, is also administered to the whole class at once but is more
holistic. This is a Story Comprehension Assessment that assesses students’ ability to read a story
similar to the ones in the Reader and answer comprehension questions in a fixed period of time. If
students take an inordinately long time to read the story or have difficulty answering the questions
in the time allotted, you should meet individually with students and listen to them read the story a
second time. For more details, see Lesson 25.


The purpose of both assessments is to help you determine which students are doing well with
the program and which students need more practice reading words with particular spellings or
connected text.


~~**SMALL GROUP WORK**~~


In this unit, explicit instructions on how to integrate small group work is provided. Small group work is
signaled by a star in a dark circle. Exercises for two groups are suggested, assuming that Group 1 consists
of students who need more support and Group 2 of students who can work independently. Of course, you
may subdivide your class further. Small group work is suggested for either story reading time or activity
page work. You will have the choice to (1) have both groups work on the same skill with the independent
group working on their own while the other group receives guidance from you or (2) reteach/reinforce a
skill that you feel needs to be practiced more with Group 1. For reteaching/reinforcing skills please reuse
material from relevant lessons and consult the Unit 6 Pausing Point for additional exercises and activity
pages. Please keep in mind that you do not have to use the small group configuration every time that it is
suggested and that you can adapt other lessons so they contain small group work.


~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice the Unit 6 skills can be found in the
Pausing Point section included after the last lesson. It is strongly recommended that you pause for 1
day and provide targeted remediation for individual or groups of students in any areas in which they
performed poorly on the end-of-unit assessment.

~~**LESSON AT A GLANCE**~~


Foundational Skills 6


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


Today and in the following lessons you will talk about three spellings for the
/s/ sound, one of the trickiest consonant sounds to spell. Students should
already know the basic code spelling ‘s’ as in _sit_ and the spelling ‘ss’ as in
_dress_ . In today’s lesson you will review these spellings and introduce the
spelling alternative ‘c’ as in _cent_ . In following lessons you will introduce the
spelling alternatives ‘se’ as in _rinse_ and ‘ce’ as in _prince_ . The chart shows how
common each spelling is.


Note that the ‘c’ and ‘ce’ spelling alternatives for /s/ may be confusing for
students, particularly in words with separated digraphs, such as _nice_ and
_place_ . The most important take-away for students is that they understand
that ‘c’ and ‘ce’ are spelling alternatives are grouped for the /s/ sound.
In word sorts, these spelling alternatives go in one column to place the
emphasis on the ‘c’ standing for the /s/ sound, rather than specifying that
students distinguish between the ‘c’ and ‘ce’ spellings for /s/.


Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


    - ‘ **s** ’ is used to spell /s/ in the initial consonant clusters _sk–, sl–, sm–, sn–,_
_sp–, spl–, spr–, st–, str–, sw– squ–_ ( _skip, slip, smile, snip, spin, splash,_
_spread, steep, straw, swine, squint_ ) and final clusters _–sk, –sp, –st_ ( _desk,_
_wasp, best_ ).


    - ‘ **s** ’ is used at the end of words to mark a plural ( _cats, hips_ ) or a verb form
( _it fits, she skates_ ).


    - ‘ **c** ’ is used at the beginning of words that start with _ce–, ci–, cy–_ ( _cent,_
_cinnamon, Cyprus_ ), but ‘ **s** ’ can be used before those letters as well
( _sent, sip, syrup_ ).


Lesson 1 Spelling Alternatives: Introduce /s/ › ‘c’
**9**


**10**




   - ‘ **ss** ’, ‘ **ce** ’, and ‘ **se** ’ are used to spell final /s/ that is not a plural marker or
a verb form ( _dress, prince, house_ ). These spellings are never used at the
beginning of a word.


   - ‘ **ss** ’ is typically used after a “short” vowel sound ( _fuss, miss, confess_ ).


   - ‘ **ce** ’ and ‘ **se** ’ are typically used after other vowel sounds ( _force, choice,_
_horse_ ) and in consonant clusters ( _prince, rinse_ ).


**Foundational Skills**

 - Prepare to display the Consonant Code Flip Book for /s/ within view of all
students. You may wish to tab page 11. Also have the Spelling Cards listed
in the Lesson at a Glance chart, student Individual Code Charts, and red
markers readily available.


 - Prepare the Spelling Alternatives Observation Record provided in Teacher
Resources. Over the course of the unit, be sure to ask each student to decode
words with each of the sound spellings taught.


 - Over the course of this unit, you will be asked to make and display four
Spelling Tree wall displays. Templates to assist you in making a Spelling
Tree are provided in Teacher Resources. You should have the Spelling Tree
assembled and ready to be displayed before you begin the lesson, but do
not attach any leaves prior to the lesson.


 - Make the trunk of the Spelling Tree out of brown construction paper or
draw the trunk on white chart paper. The branches should vary in length
and correlate with the power bar on the Spelling Cards. For example, the ‘s’
spelling is the most common spelling for the /s/ sound, so its branch is the
longest on the /s/ Tree. The shortest branch on the tree is on the top for odd
ducks. Odd ducks are words having the /s/ sound spelled in a way that is not
explicitly taught in the unit.


 - The /s/ Spelling Tree should have six branches forking off from the central
trunk. Use five of the branches for the more common spellings (‘s’, ‘ss’, ‘c’, ‘se’,
and ‘ce’), and one branch for odd ducks.


 - On green paper, make multiple copies of the leaf template found in Teacher
Resources. Write /s/ words on the leaves ( _snake, sit, sun, song, kiss, dress,_
_cell, cent, pencil)_ .


 - On yellow paper, make multiple copies of the odd duck template found in
Teacher Resources. You do not need to write words in advance on the odd
ducks; just have these available during the lesson in the event a student
offers a word with the /s/ sound that doesn’t fall into one of the spelling
patterns students will learn in this unit, such as ‘sc’ in _scent_ .

  - Review with students the Spelling Cards for /s/ > ‘s’ and ‘ss’, reading the
sample words and discussing the power bars.


  - Write ‘s’ on the board/chart paper, along with the sample words: _sun, sit._


  - Follow the same procedure for ‘ss’, with sample words: _dress, kiss._


  - Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart page 8** .


  - Have them locate and trace in red the outline of the card and the code
information for /s/ > ‘s’ with a finger. Follow the same procedure for /s/ > ‘ss’.


  - Tell students they will now learn another spelling for the /s/ sound.


  - Write ‘c’ on the board/chart paper, along with the sample words: _cinch,_
_cell._ You may want to discuss the words _cell_ and distinguish it from the
homophone _sell._


  - Show students the Spelling Card for /s/ > ‘c’ ( _cinch_ ). Discuss the power bar
and have students read the example word. Attach the Spelling Card to the
appropriate place.


  - You may want to point out that the ‘c’ spelling can stand for two different
sounds: /k/ and /s/. (Students will practice this tricky spelling in
later lessons.)

~~**LESSON AT A GLANCE**~~


Foundational Skills 6


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


Today students will work on decoding the tricky spelling ‘c’. This spelling
poses a problem for readers because it can be pronounced /k/ (sometimes
called hard ‘c’) or /s/ (sometimes called soft ‘c’). The following chart shows
that /k/ is the more common pronunciation. If students come across an
unfamiliar printed word with the letter ‘c’, they should try pronouncing the
‘c’ as /k/. If that does not sound like a word, or if the resulting word does
not make sense in context, students should try /s/.


  - Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


    - ‘ **c** ’ is likely to be pronounced /s/ when followed by ‘e’, ‘i’, or ‘y’ ( _cent_,
city, _cypress_ ).


    - ‘ **c** ’ is likely to be pronounced /k/ when followed by ‘a’, ‘o’, or ‘u’ ( _cat, cot,_
_cut_ ), when part of a consonant cluster ( _clip, crop, scatter, fact_ ), or when
at the end of a word or syllable ( _picnic, mimic_ ).


    - In ‘cc’ words, the first ‘ **c** ’ is often pronounced /k/ and the second one
/s/ ( _accent, accept_ ) but not always ( _accord, raccoon_ ).

 - Point to the second arrow from ‘c’ to the /s/ words. Explain that
/s/ is a less likely option and that they should try it if the first option does
not sound right.


 - Leave the diagram on display so students can refer to it as they work on the
next exercise.


Check for Understanding


Write the word _rice_ on the board. Use the diagram to figure out the pronunciation.

Try the word with the /k/ sound first ( _rike_ ). Have students use **Thumbs-Up/**

**Thumbs-Down** to show you if they think this is the correct pronunciation. Then, say

the word with the /s/ sound ( _rice_ ). Have students use Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down to

show if they think this is the correct pronunciation. Discuss the correct answer.


~~**TRICKY SPELLING PRACTICE (15 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** Use “think aloud” strategies, where you describe your thought
processes (as a fluent adult reader) aloud for the benefit of students. You
might also talk about context clues and how to use them to supplement
decoding skills.


 - Distribute Activity Page 2.1.


 - Explain that the underlined spellings are examples of the tricky spelling ‘c’.
They stand for either /k/ as in _cat_ or /s/ as in _cent_ .


 - Tell students that when they encounter the spelling ‘c’ in a printed word they
do not already know, they should try pronouncing it /k/ as in _cat_ . If that
does not sound right, or does not make sense in context, they should try
pronouncing it /s/ as in _cent_ .


 - Read the first sentence on the activity page and pronounce the tricky spelling
‘c’ > /k/: “She is a good /d/ /a/ /n/ /k/ /er/.”


 - Ask students if that sounds right (i.e., is it a word they recognize).


 - Explain that, since /d/ /a/ /n/ /k/ /er/ sounds wrong, students need to try
it the other way.


 - Read the sentence again, pronouncing the tricky spelling ‘c’ > /s/: “She is a
good /d/ /a/ /n/ /s/ /er/.”

Ask students if that sounds right.




 - Have students copy the word _dancer_ under the heading “/s/ as in _cent_ .”


 - Work through the remaining sentences, calling on students to read the
sentences aloud. Have them try the tricky spelling both ways, and choose
the pronunciation that sounds right and/or makes sense.

 - Select an event that all students in the class participated in recently
(e.g., a field trip, a classroom visit, a celebration, a performance).


 - Remind students of the shared event and review what happened during
the event, asking students to talk about significant details they remember.


 - Explain that the class experienced this event as a group, so it would be
possible to write about it as a group, saying what we did and how it made
us feel. However, that is not the way a personal narrative is usually written.


 - Explain that a personal narrative is usually written with an “I” character
as the narrator, with the narrator describing what they did.


 - Explain that you would like the class to write a personal narrative about
something they all experienced but using the voice of one member of the class.


 - Ask if anyone would like to volunteer to be the “I” character, or narrator,
for the personal narrative.


 - Select a student to be the “I” character, or narrator. Explain that you will be
asking this person to share their experience, while asking the other members
of the class to add details and expand on the narrator’s recollections. The
end result will be a narrative of the event as experienced by this student, but
with the assistance of the other members of the class.


 - Ask the narrator if he or she can think of a good title for the personal
narrative. Explain that the title should give the reader a sense of what the
main event was. (If the narrator has trouble thinking of a title, ask the class. If
students all have trouble thinking of a title at this point, you can return to this
section of the activity page later, after planning the other parts of
the narrative.)


 - Ask the narrator and other students about the characters involved in the
narrative. Remind students that characters answer the “Who?” question of
the 5 “W” questions. One of them should be the student chosen to be the “I”
character, or narrator.

narrative is about. Take notes and/or write in complete sentences, either on
the planning chart or blank chart paper if more space is needed.


  - Next, ask the narrator and/or other students about the setting. Remind
students to ask the following “W” questions: Where did the event take place?
When did it take place?


  - Ask the narrator to answer the “W” question: What happened? Work with the
class to add details and divide the events into a beginning, middle, and end.
You can write complete sentences or just notes.


  - Ask the narrator to answer the “W” question: Why did this happen? Work with
the class to add details and explain why this event or tale was important. You
can write complete sentences or just notes.


  - Be sure to consult frequently with the student chosen to be the “I” character.


  - Since it is a personal narrative, the notes you jot down on the planning
template should reflect their experience of the event.

Do one together for practice. Say the /er/ sound, and tell students to raise
their hands when they find the speech bubble with the /er/ sound.




 - Now tell students to quickly scan all the spellings listed in the row next to the
speech bubble, looking for any that are outlined in green. Tell them this is a
quick way to find the spellings they have already learned. Tell all students to
raise their hands when they find a green spelling for this speech bubble.


 - Call on one student to give the spelling and read the example word as follows:
/er/ is spelled ‘er’ and the example word is _her_ .


 - Tell students that you are ready to start the race. You will call on the first
student to raise their hand after they have found the sound, spelling,

~~**TRICKY SPELLING ‘C’ (10 MIN.)**~~


**Word Sort**

 - Write /k/ as in _cat_ and /s/ as in _cent_ on the board as column headings.


 - Remind students that tricky spellings are tricky because they can be
pronounced more than one way. The spelling ‘c’ can be pronounced /k/
as in _cat_ and /s/ as in _cent_ .


 - Tell students that there are ten cards with words containing the tricky
spelling ‘c’.


 - Show students the words and sort the words as a class under the correct
heading on the board. There are five cards for each sound. Have students
share sentences with each word that they sort.

to listen to each student read the word on their card.


~~**USING A DICTIONARY (10 MIN.)**~~


) **Word Hunt**


 - Explain to students that sometimes we hear or read words that are
unfamiliar. We can use certain strategies to clarify the meaning of these
words. To clarify the meaning of words:

   - Identify the word.

   - Ask yourself: What other words surround this word? Where have you heard
this word before?

   - Finally, identify which resource materials you can use to define the word,
such as a simple dictionary or glossary.


 - Choose a book from the classroom library that uses words that students may
not know.

 - Read a few pages aloud.

 - Say, “I am not sure I know the word _____. Point to the word. I will think about
the other words that are around this word. I will also think about where I have
heard this word before. What words are around the word I have chosen? Let’s
brainstorm where we may have heard this word before.”

 - If the book has a glossary, say, “This book has a glossary. I can go to the back
of the book and use the alphabetized list of words to find my word. When I
find the word, I can confirm what it means.

 - If the book does not have a glossary, say, “This book does not have a
glossary, but I can use a simple dictionary, find the first letter of the word,
and use the alphabetized list of words to find my word. When I find the word, I
can confirm the meaning.”


 - Display a Read-Aloud or other classroom text. Read the text for the class, and
circle a word that students may be unfamiliar with. Have students use the
strategy from the model to clarify the meaning of the word you circled.

**Digital Component 2.2**




  - Remind students that they can also reference the planning chart of
decodable questions that are useful when writing a personal narrative.


  - Tell students that the first thing they need to write on the draft is the title.


  - Ask students to suggest a good title for this draft personal narrative.
Write the agreed upon title at the top center of the blank chart paper.


  - Tell students that the first sentence of the personal narrative should
introduce the narrator and other important characters and also identify
the setting (specifying where and when the event took place).


  - Work with the narrator and other students to come up with a good
introductory sentence for the personal narrative. Before transcribing the
sentence, encourage students to expand and elaborate on the initial oral
sentence by asking probing questions to elicit more details and
descriptive words.

 - Write the sentence below the title on the chart paper, using every other line.
(This leaves you space to add words or sentences later.) Make sure to indent
the sentence.

 - Point out that the sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a
punctuation mark.

 - Work with the narrator and other students to use the planning chart to
write first the beginning, then the middle, and finally the end of the personal
narrative, asking students—and especially the “I” character—to help you
transform the notes on the planning template into complete sentences.

 - Encourage students to state their ideas aloud in complete sentences.

 - Prior to any transcription, help students expand and elaborate their oral
sentences by asking probing questions to elicit more details and descriptive
words. Encourage them to think in terms of each of the five senses (e.g.,
What did the place we visited look like? What did it smell like? What sounds
did we hear?).

 - Remind students that when we write more than a few sentences, we
divide our writing into sections called paragraphs. Remind them that each
paragraph is indented. Discuss how the sentences they are writing might
be divided into paragraphs. (One method would be to have a “beginning”
paragraph, a “middle” paragraph, and an “end” paragraph to match the three
sections on the planner.)

 - Tell students that the last sentence of the narrative should wrap things up
and let the reader know that the narrative is finished.

 - Work with the narrator and the other students to come up with a good
concluding sentence for the narrative. You may also wish to have them end
with the words, “The End.” Write the concluding sentence on the chart paper.

 - Tell students that they have just finished the second step in the writing
process—they wrote a draft of a personal narrative as a group.

 - Tell students that in the next lesson they will write a personal narrative of their own.

 - Discuss with students that they will use Activity Page 2.2, sent home with
them after the prior lesson, to help write their own personal narratives.
Remind students who have not yet brought back their Activity Page 2.2 to do
so for the next day. (You may wish to contact families to ensure all students

**Primary Focus:** Students will use a planning template organized by five questions
to plan a personal narrative and will use a draft template to write the first draft of
their personal narrative. ~~**TEKS 1.1.C; TEKS 1.11.A; TEKS 1.12.A**~~


~~**PLAN AND DRAFT A PERSONAL NARRATIVE (35 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.12.A**~~


**Plan**

  - Remind students that they recently planned and drafted a personal narrative
together as a class.


  - Tell students that now you would like each of them to begin working on a
personal narrative of their own, just as they did as a class.
) **Digital Component 1.1**


  - Point to The Writing Process graphic. Remind students that the first step in
the writing process is to make a plan.


  - Explain that the first thing that students need to do is pick an event that actually
happened to them that they would like to describe in their personal narrative.


  - Remind students that their homework was to brainstorm ideas for a personal
narrative. Distribute Activity Page 2.2 back to students so they may use it as
they plan their personal narratives.


**TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using
the conventions of language; **TEKS 1.11.A** Plan a first draft by generating ideas for writing such as by drawing and brainstorming; **TEKS 1.12.A** Dictate or compose literary texts, including personal narratives and poetry.

first read over their partner’s draft, and then follow the editing checklist.
Students should mark their partner’s draft in another color and be careful to
keep their partner’s draft nice and neat so their partner can read their edits.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to quickly review the steps involved in editing their partners’ drafts. Have

students use **Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down** to respond to statements such as: _First, I_
_will read over my partner’s draft._ (thumbs-up) _I will follow the editing checklist._
(thumbs-up) _I will mark my partner’s draft in the same color._ (thumbs-down)
Discuss the correct answer.

as needed.


  - After students have completed reviewing their partner’s draft, give each
pair two sticky notes, each of a different color. On the first sticky note, have
students write down something they like about their partner’s draft. On
the second sticky note, have students write down something that could be
improved in the draft.

 - Make one copy of the Record Sheet for Progress Monitoring 1
**(Activity Page TR 5.2)** for each student you are assessing.


 - Model with the sample item.


 - Show the cards to the student one at a time. Use the record sheet to record
each word as the student reads.


 - Place a check next to each word read correctly.


 - For misread words, write exactly what students say as the word is sounded
out. If students misread a word, prompt them to try to read the word again,
letting them know their first attempt was incorrect.


**Scoring:** Scoring is based on one point assigned for every sound/spelling in
a word which is read correctly. Interpret scores as follows:


   - 11 or 12 points—excellent


   - 8–10 points—good


   - Less than 8 points—poor


**Goal:** Achieve scores of good or excellent (11 points or more).


Scores of 8 or less indicate additional reteaching and reinforcement is
required. Further analyze student errors to determine whether there are one
or more particularly problematic sound/spellings. The subtotals for targeted
sound/spellings at the bottom of the record sheet facilitate the identification
of specific problem areas.


Foundational Skills 6


Also examine whether there are mispronunciations occurring more
frequently in a given position in words. For example, does the student read
the initial sound correctly, but misread the medial and/or final sound?


Finally, examine whether the student succeeded in reading words correctly
on the second attempt. If so, the student may be rushing and may benefit
from explicit instruction to slow down and look at each letter in a word
sequentially, left to right.

front of the library?”


Intermediate
Provide sentence frames

Advanced/Advanced High

Encourage students
to use location words
(prepositions) and
description words
(adjectives) to build longer
sentences.

~~**ELPS 2.G; ELPS 3.C**~~


**82**




- Have students read the sentence, and ask them whom the sentence is
about. ( _Gus_ )


- Circle the word _Gus_ and explain that it is a proper noun.


- Read the sentence again and ask students what Gus does. ( _runs_ )


- Draw a squiggly line under the word _runs_ and explain that it is a verb.


- Ask students, “Where does Gus run?” Tell students to think of location words.
Write their answer on the board.


- Ask students, “When does Gus run?” Guide them to think of adverbs that
convey time, such as _usually, always,_ or _never._ Remind students that adverbs
describe adjectives, verbs, or other adverbs.


- Now tell students they will practice making other simple sentences longer.
On the board write the sentence: _Kate found a coin_ .


- Have students read the sentence, and ask them whom the sentence is
about. ( _Kate_ )


- Circle the word _Kate_ and explain that it is a proper noun.


- Read the sentence again and ask what Kate did. ( _found a coin_ )


- Draw a squiggly line under the verb _found_, and explain that _found_ is the verb.


- Ask students, “What type of coin did Kate find?” ( _old, Spanish_ ). Write the
expanded sentence on the board.


- Ask students, “Where did Kate find the old Spanish coin?” ( _in the cave_ ). Then
ask, “In what manner did she find the coin?” _(quickly)._ Write the expanded
sentence on the board, noting that it is much easier to form a picture of the
sentence in their minds with this extra information added: _Kate found an old_
_Spanish coin in the cave_ .


- Repeat this procedure with the other sentences you prepared in advance,
circling the nouns and drawing squiggly lines under the verbs.

**Digital Component 8.2**










  - Point to the words _gum, glad_, and _dog_ on the left side of the board and read
them aloud.


  - Point out that the spelling ‘g’ is pronounced /g/ in these words.


  - Point to the words _gem_ and _germ_ on the right side of the board and read
them aloud.


  - Point out that, in these words, the spelling ‘g’ is pronounced /j/ rather than /g/.


  - Ask students how this could cause them problems when they are reading.


  - Explain that ‘g’ is what we call a tricky spelling. The spelling is tricky because
it can be pronounced more than one way. To figure out how to pronounce this
tricky spelling, students may need to try it both ways.


  - Point to the circled letter ‘g’ on the board between the two sets of words.


  - Point to the arrow from ‘g’ to the /g/ words that is labeled ‘1’. Explain that /g/
is the most likely pronouncing option and therefore the one they should
try first.

 - Point to the second arrow from ‘g’ to the /j/ words. Explain that /j/ is a
less likely option and that they should try it if the first option does not
sound right.


 - Explain that when students encounter the spelling ‘g’ in a printed word they
do not already know, they should try pronouncing it /g/ as in _gum_ . If that
does not sound right, or does not make sense in context, they should try
pronouncing it /j/ as in _gem_ .


 - Leave the diagram on the board so students can refer to it as they work on
the next exercise.


Check for Understanding


Write the word _frog_ on the board. Use the diagram to figure out the pronunciation.

Try the word with the /g/ sound first ( _frog_ ). Have students use **Thumbs-Up/**

**Thumbs-Down** to show you if they think this is the correct pronunciation. Then, say

the word with the /j/ sound ( _froj_ ). Have students use Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down to

show if they think this is the correct pronunciation. Discuss the correct answer.

~~**BUILD SENTENCES WITH PREPOSITIONS (10 MIN.)**~~



~~**TEKS 1.3.D**~~



**Note:** The purpose of this exercise is not necessarily for students to identify
prepositions by name or type, but rather to recognize that they are useful in
building longer sentences.


  - Remind students that when they write, they should strive to make their
writing interesting. Tell students that one way they can do this is by adding
words called prepositions to simple sentences.


  - Prepositions are tiny words that give information about time, place, locations,
etc., in a sentence.


  - Write the following sentence on the board: _The mouse ran_ . Point out that this
is a very simple sentence.


  - Ask students to identify the noun and the verb in this sentence; circle the
noun and draw a squiggly line under the verb.


  - Ask students, “Where did the mouse run?” Record students’ answers under
the heading _Where_ ?


  - Students will say various answers, but most of these answers will need to be
connected by the prepositions _to, from, under,_ etc.


  - Let the class choose one of the answers. Use it to write a revised sentence on
the board (e.g., _The mouse ran under the desk_ .). Point out that you added a
preposition and a place to this sentence. The preposition _under_ lets you know
where the mouse ran in relation to the desk.


  - Write revised sentences using other prepositions that students know as
Tricky Words or can decode: _to, with,_ and _from_ . Note that prepositions are
not always linked to time and place, but also more abstract concepts such
as means or purpose. You may want to provide additional practice orally
with prepositions that students have not yet learned to read, such as _over,_
_through, around, during,_ and _near_ .

 - Remind students that the word _she_ is a pronoun—a word that takes the
place of a noun.


 - Ask students which word the pronoun _she_ is replacing.


 - If students have difficulty identifying the noun, connect _Jen_ and _she_ with a
curved line before they answer.


 - Write the following sentence on the board: _Ben rides a horse._

 - Ask students, “Who ate pancakes yesterday?” ( _Francis_ )


 - Ask students which word took the place of the word _Francis_ . ( _I_ )


 - Connect the words _Francis_ and _I_ with a curved line.


 - Tell students that the word _I_ is a pronoun that takes the place of the word
_Francis_ when Francis is talking about himself.


 - Ask a student to make up a sentence with the pronoun _I_ . For example, a
student could say, “I have black socks.” Ask the class who has black socks.
Then ask the class which word the student used instead of their name. ( _I_ )

 - Tell students that the word _you_ is a pronoun and it takes the place of the word
_Francis_ when somebody else is talking about him.


 - Ask a student to make up a sentence with the pronoun _you_ . For example, a
student could say, “You are wearing a blue shirt.” Ask students who is wearing a
blue shirt. Then ask the class which word the student used instead of the name
of the student wearing a blue shirt. ( _you_ )


 - Distribute Activity Page 9.1.


 - In each sentence pair, have students underline the pronoun and draw a
connecting line from the pronoun to the noun it replaces. Then have students
write the pronouns on the lines. This should be a teacher–led exercise for at

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Foundational Skills**

 - Prepare to display the Consonant Code Flip Book within view of all students.
You may wish to tab page 16. Also have the Spelling Cards listed in the Lesson
at a Glance, student Individual Code Charts, and red markers readily available.


 - Make a Spelling Tree out of brown construction paper or draw the trunk on
white chart paper, using the template provided in Teacher Resources. The /n/
Spelling Tree should have four branches forking off from the central trunk.
Use three of the branches for the more common spellings (‘n’, ‘nn’, and ‘kn’),
and one branch at the top for odd ducks.


 - On green paper, make multiple copies of the leaf template found in Teacher
Resources. Write /n/ words on the leaves ( _nut, nice, cent, dinner, running,_
_fanning, note, knot, knit, knife, knock, knee)_ .


 - On yellow paper, make multiple copies of the odd duck template found in
Teacher Resources. You do not need to write words in advance on the odd
ducks; just have these available during the lesson in the event a student
offers a word with the /n/ sound that doesn’t fall into one of the spelling
patterns students will learn in this unit, such as ‘gn’ in _gnat_ .


 - Copy and prepare Spelling Alternatives Observation Record for /n/, located
in Teacher Resources.


**Reading**

 - Plan to divide students into two groups. You will work with Group 1, students
who need more direct support and immediate feedback, while students in
Group 2 should partner read.

Challenge


Have students write
sentences for two or three
of the spelling words on
the back of Activity

  - After all the words have been called out, tell students you will now dictate a
sentence that uses a spelling word. They will write the entire sentence on the
back of Activity Page 10.1. Say, “Here are the pigs.”

  - Tell students that you will now show them the correct spelling for each word so
they can correct their own work.

  - Say and write each word on the board/chart paper, instructing students to
correct their work by crossing out any incorrect spelling, and writing the
correct spelling next to it.


Collect Activity Page 10.1. At a later time today, use the spelling analysis tools

provided in Teacher Resources to analyze students’ mistakes. This will help you

to understand any patterns that are beginning to develop or that are persistent

  - Turn to **Consonant Code Flip Book page 16** . Review with students the basic
code spelling for /n/. Read the sample word on the card and discuss the
power bar. Remind students that the long power bar tells us that ‘n’ is the
most common spelling for /n/.


  - Write ‘n’ on the board/chart paper, along with the sample words: _nut, cent._


  - Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart page 8** .


  - Have students locate and trace the red outline of the card and the code
information for /n/ > ‘n’ with a finger.


  - Ask students to tell you another spelling they know for /n/. Point to the ‘nn’
Spelling Card, discussing the sample word and power bar.


  - Write ‘nn’ on the board/chart paper, along with the sample words:
_dinner, running_ .


  - Have students locate and trace the red outline of the card and the code

 - Tell students they will now learn another spelling for the /n/ sound.


 - Show students the Spelling Card for /n/ > ‘kn’ ( _knock_ ). Discuss the power
bar and have students read the example word. Attach the Spelling Card to
the appropriate place.


 - Write ‘kn’ on the board/chart paper, along with the sample words: _knot, knit._


 - Have students outline the ‘kn’ spelling in red marker in their Individual Code
Charts. The spellings can be found on the following pages in the Consonant
Code Flip Book and in students’ Individual Code Charts.


 - Tell students that whenever the new spelling ‘kn’ appears on an activity page
or in a story for the next few lessons, it will be printed in bold type to remind
them that this is a spelling they learned recently.


Check for Understanding


Write the words _knot, knock, clock, knee, keep, need, supper, dinner_ on the board/

chart paper and read them aloud, pointing to the individual sounds as you segment

the word. Ask students to raise their hand if the word has the /n/ sound.


~~**SPELLING TREE FOR /N/ (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Show students the Spelling Tree and explain that you are going to use it to
help them keep track of the spellings for the /n/ sound.


 - Point to the trunk labeled /n/.


 - Point to the four branches: ‘n’, ‘nn’, ‘kn’, and odd ducks. Explain that the ‘n’
branch is the longest and on the bottom and the ‘nn’ and ‘kn’ branches are
shorter and near the top because these sound/spellings are less frequent.


 - Remind students that the smallest branch (or the one with the least open
space around it) is for odd ducks.


 - Shuffle the leaves and then show each leaf.


 - Ask a student to read the leaf and then place it on the correct branch of the
Spelling Tree.

   - 13 or 14 points—excellent


   - 11 or 12 points—good


   - Less than 11 points—poor


**Goal:** Achieve scores of good or excellent (11 points or more).


Scores of 10 or less indicate additional reteaching and reinforcement is
required. Further analyze student errors to determine whether there are one
or more particularly problematic sound/spellings. The subtotals for targeted
sound/spellings at the bottom of the record sheet facilitate the identification
of specific problem areas.


Also examine whether there are mispronunciations occurring more
frequently in a given position in words. For example, does the student
read the initial sound correctly, but misread the medial and/or final sound?

  - Remind students that when they write, they should strive to make their
writing interesting.


  - Tell students that one way that they can do this is by adding descriptive
words called adjectives to the nouns in simple sentences.


  - Write the following sentence on the board: _The dog barked_ . Point out that this
is a very simple sentence.


  - Ask students to identify the noun and verb in this sentence; circle the noun
and underline the verb with a squiggly line.


  - Ask students which tense the verb is in: past, present, or future. ( _past_ ) How
can they tell? ( _–ed is the past-tense marker_ )

use in expanding the sentence ( _at the doorbell, at the truck, at the storm_ ).


 - Prepositions are tiny words that give information about time, place, etc.,
in a sentence. The word _at_ is a preposition.


 - Write the expanded sentence on the board: _The cute dog barked at the truck_ .


 - Work with students to expand other simple sentences using other decodable

**Foundational Skills**

 - Prepare to display the Consonant Code Flip Book within view of all students.
You may wish to tab page 21. Also have the Spelling Cards listed in the Lesson
at a Glance, student Individual Code Charts, and red markers readily available.


 - Make a Spelling Tree out of brown construction paper or draw the trunk on
white chart paper, using the template provided in Teacher Resources. The
/w/ Spelling Tree should have three branches forking off from the central
trunk. Use two of the branches for the more common spellings (‘w’ and ‘wh’),
and one branch at the top for odd ducks.


 - On green paper, make multiple copies of the leaf template found in Teacher
Resources. Write /w/ words on the leaves ( _wet, switch, whale, white, whoosh,_
_whiz, whimper, will, wave, wheel, wheezing)_ .


 - On yellow paper, make multiple copies of the odd duck template found in
Teacher Resources. You do not need to write words in advance on the odd
ducks; just have these available during the lesson in the event a student
offers a word with the /w/ sound that doesn’t fall into one of the spelling
patterns students will learn in this unit, such as Tricky Words _one_ and _once_ .


 - Make a copy of and prepare the Spelling Alternatives Observation Record for
/w/ provided in Teacher Resources for use during the Spelling Tree activity.


**Reading**

 - Plan to divide students into two groups. You will work with Group 1, students
who need more direct support and immediate feedback, while students in
Group 2 will partner read.

branch is the longest and on the bottom and the ‘wh’ branch is shorter and
near the top because this sound/spelling is less frequent.


 - Remind students that the smallest branch (or the one with the least open
space around it) is for odd ducks.

Tricky Word _why_ . ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.vi; TEKS 1.2.C.i; TEKS 1.2.C.ii; TEKS 1.2.C.iii; TEKS 1.2.C.iv**~~


~~**INTRODUCE SPELLING WORDS (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that they will have a list of spelling words to practice and
learn each week.


  - Tell students that the words for this week will use the spelling alternatives
that they have learned for the /n/ sound. Write the following headings on the
board in columns: ‘n’, ‘nn’, ‘kn’.


  - Read and write each spelling word, underlining and reviewing the alternative
spelling in each word. Have students repeat each word after you. Remind
students that the last word is a Tricky Word. Tricky Words do not follow the
rules, so their spellings must be memorized.


  - Ask one or more students to use each word in a sentence, making sure to
explain vocabulary for any words they may not know.


  - The words for the week are:

|/n/ > ‘n’|/n/ > ‘nn’|/n/ > ‘kn’|Tricky Word|
|---|---|---|---|
|center|running|knit|why|
|nose|winner|kneel||
|nugget||||



  - Tell students they will also spell an entire sentence that uses one of the
words. Have them practice in their Dictation Journals with the following
sentence: _Why is the water running?_

**TEKS 1.2.B.vi** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by identifying and reading at least 100 high-frequency words
from a research-based list; **TEKS 1.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling words with closed syllables,

/ng/ Spelling Tree should have three branches forking off from the central
trunk. Use two of the branches for the more common spellings (‘ng’ and ‘n’),
and one branch at the top for odd ducks.


 - On green paper, make multiple copies of the leaf template found in Teacher
Resources. Write /ng/ words on the leaves ( _sing, ring, thing, wrong, bank,_
_pink, think, blanket, finger)_ .


 - On yellow paper, make multiple copies of the odd duck template found in

- Write ‘ng’ on the board/chart paper, along with the sample words: _sing, long._


- Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart page 8** .


- Have students locate and trace the red outline of the card and the code
information for /ng/ > ‘ng’ with a finger.


- Tell students they will now learn another spelling for the /ng/ sound.


- Show students the Spelling Card for /ng/ > ‘n’ ( _pink_ ). Discuss the power bar
and have students read the example word. Attach the Spelling Card to the
appropriate place.


- Write ‘n’ on the board/chart paper, along with the sample words: _pink, think._


Foundational Skills 6


 - Have students outline the ‘n’ spelling in red marker in their Individual
Code Charts.


 - Tell students that whenever the new spelling /ng/ > ‘n’ appears on an activity
page or in a story for the next few lessons, it will be printed in bold type to
remind them that this is a spelling they learned recently.


Check for Understanding


Write the words _wing, thing, thin, think, sing, sink, son, win, wink_ on the board/chart

paper and read them aloud, pointing to the individual sounds as you segment the

word. Ask students to raise their hand if the word has the /ng/ sound.


~~**SPELLING TREE FOR /NG/ (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Show students the Spelling Tree and explain that you are going to use it to
help them keep track of the spellings for the /ng/ sound.


 - Point to the trunk labeled /ng/.


 - Point to the three branches: ‘ng’, ‘n’, and odd ducks. Explain that the ‘ng’
branch is the longest and on the bottom and the ‘n’ branch is shorter and
near the top because this sound/spelling is less frequent.


 - Remind students that the smallest branch (or the one with the least open
space around it) is for odd ducks.


 - Shuffle the leaves and then show each leaf.


 - Ask a student to read the leaf and then place it on the correct branch of the
Spelling Tree.


Check for Understanding


Observe as students read words on the spelling leaves to see if they are pronouncing

the /ng/ sound correctly.

**188**



**Wrap-Up**

 - Use the following questions to guide discussion about the story.


**Discussion Questions for “Grace the Performer”**


1. **Literal.** Describe what Grace wears when she performs as a mime. You should look at
the text and images to answer the question.


» Answers may vary, but should reference specific details from the text, or the
illustration on page 55. (Grace wears striped knee socks, green pants, and a green
top; She wears white make-up and red lipstick; She wears a colorful wig with a hat
pinned to it, and a big red nose.)


2. **Inferential.** What makes the job of a mime hard? What makes the job fun?


» The job of a mime is hard because they must perform without talking; The job of a
mime would be fun because they make people laugh.


3. **Evaluative.** Do you think it would be hard to make people laugh without talking?


» Answers may vary. (You may wish to prompt students to discuss what would be
hard and what would be fun about being a mime.)


Check for Understanding


Have students **Turn and Talk** with a partner to summarize the three parts of

Grace’s act. Tell students to look for words in the text that can help them identify

the separate parts of her act. (If students struggle to start, you may wish to point

out that the first paragraph on page 56 begins “Grace starts off with . . .” The second

paragraph begins “Next Grace . . .” And the third paragraph begins “At the end . . .” to

help students identify the three parts.)


Observation: Discussion Questions


Call on a different student to answer each question. Note student performance in the

When students encounter
the spelling ‘n’ in a printed
word they do not already
know, they should try
pronouncing it /n/ as in
_nap_ . If that does not sound
right, or does not make
sense in context, they
should try pronouncing it
/ng/ as in _pink_ .


Activity Page 19.1


**196**




 - Point to the words _nap, fun,_ and _nod_ on the left side of the board and read
them aloud.


 - Point out that the spelling ‘n’ is pronounced /n/ in these words.


 - Point to the words _pink, drink_, and _bank_ on the right side of the board and
read them aloud.


 - Point out that, in these words, the spelling ‘n’ is pronounced /ng/ rather than /n/.


 - Ask students how this could cause them problems when they are reading.


 - Explain that ‘n’ is a tricky spelling. The spelling is tricky because it can be
pronounced more than one way. To figure out how to pronounce this tricky
spelling, students may need to try it both ways.


 - Point to the circled letter ‘n’ on the board between the two sets of words.


 - Point to the arrow from the ‘n’ to the /n/ words that is labeled ‘1’. Explain that
/n/ is the most likely pronouncing option and therefore the one they should
try first.


 - Point to the second arrow that goes from ‘n’ to the /ng/ words. Explain that
/ng/ is a less likely option and that they should try it if the first option does
not sound right.


 - Leave the diagram on the board so students can consult it as they work on
the next exercise.


Check for Understanding


Write the word _sink_ on the board. Use the diagram to figure out the pronunciation.

Try the word with the /n/ sound first (/s/ /i/ /n/ /k/ extending the /n/ sound).

Have students use **Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down** to show you if they think this is the

correct pronunciation. Then, say the word with the /ng/ sound (annunciate the /ng/

sound). Have students use Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down to show if they think this is

the correct pronunciation. Discuss the correct answer.


~~**TRICKY SPELLING PRACTICE (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Distribute Activity Page 19.1.


 - Explain that the underlined spellings are examples of the tricky spelling ‘n’.
The spelling can stand for either the /n/ sound as in _nap_ or the /ng/ sound
as in _pink_ .


Foundational Skills 6


 - Tell students that when they encounter the spelling ‘n’ in a printed word they
do not know, they should try pronouncing it /n/ as in _nap_ . If that does not
sound right or does not make sense in context, they should try pronouncing
it /ng/ as in _pink_ .


 - Read the first item on the activity page and pronounce the tricky spelling ‘n’
as /n/: “I’m hot. Can I have something to /d/ /r/ /i/ /n/ /k/?” (Note that it is
difficult to pronounce /n/ in this situation; your mouth will want to say /ng/.
Try extending the /n/ sound.) Ask students if that sounds right.


 - Explain that, because /d/ /r/ /i/ /n/ /k/ doesn’t sound correct, you need to
try it the other way.


 - Read the sentence again, pronouncing the tricky spelling ‘n’ as /ng/: “I’m hot.
Can I have a /d/ /r/ /i/ /ng/ /k/?” Ask students if that sounds right.


 - Have students copy the word _drink_ under the heading ‘n’ > /ng/.


 - Work through the next three sentences, calling on students to read
the sentences aloud, try the tricky spelling both ways, and choose the
pronunciation that sounds right and/or makes sense.


Check for Understanding


Have students read the fifth sentence together: “When will this end?” Ask students to

try the tricky spellings both ways and take a class poll of which pronunciation sounds

correct and/or makes sense.


 - Have students complete the remaining sentences independently,
pronouncing the words both ways silently or in a whisper.

~~**PROGRESS MONITORING (OPTIONAL)**~~


  - Make a copy of the Word Cards for Progress Monitoring 3 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 20.1** ). Cut apart the word cards.


  - Make one copy of the Record Sheet for Progress Monitoring 3 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 20.2** ) for each student you are assessing.


  - Follow the procedure for Progress Monitoring in Lesson 5.


**Scoring:** Scoring is based on one point assigned for every sound-spelling in
a word which is read correctly. Interpret scores as follows:


    - 9 or 10 points—excellent


    - 7 or 8 points—good


    - Less than 7 points—poor


**Goal:** Achieve scores of good or excellent (8 points or more).


Scores of 7 or less indicate additional reteaching and reinforcement is
required. Further analyze student errors to determine whether there are one
or more particularly problematic sound/spellings. The subtotals for targeted
sound/spellings at the bottom of the record sheet facilitate the identification
of specific problem areas.


Also examine whether there are mispronunciations occurring more
frequently in a given position in words. For example, does the student read
the initial sound correctly, but misread the medial and/or final sound?


Finally, examine whether the student succeeded in reading words correctly
on the second attempt. If so, the student may be rushing and may benefit
from explicit instruction to slow down and look at each letter in a word
sequentially, left to right.


Foundational Skills 6


~~**MORE HELP WITH SOUND/SPELLINGS**~~


**Match Me**

 - Provide each student with a set of letter cards corresponding to the targeted
sound/spellings below **(Activity Page TR 2.2)** for each pair of students.






  - Tell students you will either say a sound or show a letter.


  - If a sound is provided, students should find the corresponding spelling on
the letter cards.


  - If a spelling (letter card) is shown, students should prepare to provide the
corresponding sound when prompted.


  - If anyone provides an incorrect answer, correct the error, and have students
repeat the item.


**Race to the Top**

  - Provide each student with a Race to the Top Game Board **(Activity Page**
**TR 2.1)**, a **game piece** (different colored cubes, various coins, odd-shaped
buttons), and assorted Word/Picture Cards **(Activity Pages TR 6.1, TR 12.1,**
**TR 17.1)** .


  - Cards should be concealed and drawn from **a container**, such as a brown bag.


  - Follow the steps for Race to the Top from Lesson 2 or use the following
variations:


    - Read It: As cards are drawn, the word side of the card is shown to the opposing
player to be read. The picture side allows for confirmation or/correction.


    - Spell It: As cards are drawn, the picture side of the card is shown to the
opposing player to be spelled (e.g., on a dry-erase board). The word side
allows for confirmation or correction.

Foundational Literacy Skills


The Spanish vowel system
is substantially simpler
than English. Students will
benefit from additional
practice, particularly
spelling long vowel sounds.
Working in small groups,
offer additional words with
the targeted vowel sounds
(e.g., _make, shape, kite,_
_hope_ ). After the lesson,
provide students with
these words as a bank for
them to practice spelling
with their family.










- Starting with the first word ( _tool_ ), say the word, then say it again slowly,
holding up one finger for each sound.

Lesson 22 Review and Practice: Pronouns and Vowel Digraphs
**223**


 - Ask students to count the sounds in the word and then, on their paper,
draw a line for each sound in the word.


 - Once students have drawn one line for each sound in the word, remind
them that many of these vowel sounds are spelled with two letters. These
two letters work together and are written on the same line. Allow time for
students to write the first word.


 - Before continuing with the second word ( _fuse_ ), remind students that the
long vowel sounds /ae/, /ie/, /oe/, and /ue/, are written on separate lines.
Demonstrate for students using the word _bake_ . Tell students that even
though there are only three sounds in the word _bake_, /b/ /ae/ /k/, they
should write four lines, because the ‘a_e’ are written separately.


 - Say the word _fuse_, prompting students to draw four lines even though
there are only three sounds. Have students write the spellings on their
respective lines.


 - Finally, ask students to read the word back to you.


 - Continue dictating the remaining words. After dictating all of the words,
write them on the board and have students self-correct their work.

  - Tell students to turn to Activity Page 24.1. Tell students that you are going to
say a number of words.


  - Explain that for each word that you say, there are four word choices in each
row on the activity page. Only one of the words in each row is the word you
said. Tell students to circle the word in each row that you say.


  - Read the words below.

~~**USING A DICTIONARY (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students that sometimes we hear or read words that are unfamiliar.
We can use certain strategies to clarify the meaning of these words. To clarify
the meaning of words:


   - Identify the word.


   - Ask yourself: What other words surround this word? Where have you heard
this word before?


   - Finally, identify which resource materials you can use to define the word,
such as a simple dictionary or glossary.


 - Choose a book from the classroom library that uses words that students may
not know. Read a few pages aloud.


 - Say, “I am not sure I know the word _____. Point to the word. I will think about
the other words that are around this word. I will also think about where I have
heard this word before. What words are around the word I have chosen? Let’s
brainstorm where we may have heard this word before.”


 - If the book has a glossary, say, “This book has a glossary. I can go to the back
of the book and use the alphabetized list of words to find my word. When I
find the word, I can confirm what it means.


 - If the book does not have a glossary, say, “This book does not have a
glossary, but I can use a simple dictionary, find the first letter of the word,
and use the alphabetized list of words to find my word. When I find the word, I
can confirm the meaning.”


 - Display a Read-Aloud or other classroom text. Read the text for the class, and
circle a word that students may be unfamiliar with. Have students use the
strategy from the model to clarify the meaning of the word you circled.

~~**INTRODUCE THE STORY (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that today’s story introduces students to harvest time at the
farm. Explain that the harvest occurs during the fall season, and it is when
farmers collect the things they have grown all summer long.


**Preview Spellings**

  - Refer to the chart you prepared in advance to preview the spellings before
reading the story.

~~**DISTINGUISH SIMILAR SOUNDS**~~


**Minimal Pairs**

 - Tell students that you are going to say word pairs. The words will be very
similar, but one word will begin with the /s/ sound, and the other word will
begin with the /z/ sound.


 - Have students repeat the sounds /s/ and /z/.


 - Have students close their eyes and listen as you say the first word pair.


 - Ask students which word begins with the /s/ sound.


 - Have students repeat both words to hear and feel the difference
in articulation.


 - Work through the remaining pairs.


 - Use the following minimal pairs for the sound pairs /s/ and /z/; /m/ and /n/;
and /n/ and /ng/.


**Minimal Pairs for /s/ and /z/:**



1. sink—zinc


2. sap—zap


3. sip—zip


**Minimal Pairs for /m/ and /n/:**


1. mat—gnat


2. map—nap


3. mice—nice


4. moon—noon


**Minimal Pairs for /n/ and /ng/:**


1. kin—king

7. dime—dine


8. grim—grin


5. fan—fang


6. stun—stung


7. thin—thing


8. tan—tang



**252**



Foundational Skills 6


**Consonant Blends**

  - Use this routine when teaching one-syllable spoken words with consonant
blends.


  - Say the word _grow._ Follow the routine above to blend and segment the word.
Point out that the first two sounds, /g/ and /r/, blend together to make ‘gr’.
Have students say ‘gr’ and notice how it feels on their tongues.


  - Say the following words: _crop, best._ Have students identify the blends and
whether they are at the beginning or end of the words. Then have them blend
and segment the words. ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.v; TEKS 1.2.A.vii**~~


~~**RECOGNIZE AND/OR WRITE THE SPELLINGS TAUGHT IN UNIT 6**~~


**Sound/Spelling Review with Code Flip Books**


There are many ways to use Code Flip Books for review. Here are some ideas.


1. Say a sound and ask the students to show you the spelling(s) for that sound.


2. Ask students to show you the spelling alternatives for a sound (e.g., for the
/s/ sound).


3. Ask students to show you spellings that stand for more than one sound (‘n’, ‘c’, ‘ed’, ‘g’,
‘s’).


4. Ask students to show you the most common or least common spelling for
a sound.


5. Ask students to show you the spellings they have learned in Unit 6.


**Line Race**

  - Divide the class into two groups and line them up in front of the
board/chart paper.

  - Tell students that you will call out a sound and that you want the two
students at the front of the lines to write a spelling for that sound on
the board/chart paper.

  - The student who writes a correct answer goes to the end of their line.
The other student sits down and watches for the rest of the game.

  - If both students write the same correct answer, the one who wrote it faster
continues the game and goes to the back of the line.

  - If both students write a correct answer but not the same (because of spelling
alternatives), the student who wrote it down faster goes to the end of the line.

  - Continue until only one student is left standing in line.


**TEKS 1.2.A** Demonstrate phonological awareness by (v) blending spoken phonemes to form one-syllable words, including
initial and/or final consonant blends; (vii) segmenting spoken one-syllable words of three to five phonemes into individual
phonemes, including words with initial and/or final consonant blends.


Pausing Point
**253**


 - **Modification** : If you have a helper in your classroom, play this game in
smaller groups.


**Note:** You can also play this game so students try to beat the clock instead of
the other team or student.


**Build the List**

 - Tell students that you want to review the spellings for the sounds /s/, /z/,
/m/, /n/, /ng/, and /w/ that they learned/reviewed in Unit 6.


 - Tell students that they have learned five spellings for the /s/ sound.


 - Ask students to name those spellings. Then ask students for example words.


 - Work with students to complete a list like the one shown in the following
chart, in which each spelling is listed with at least one example word.


 - If students cannot remember a spelling pattern, write a word containing that
pattern on the board. Have students read it. Then ask which letters stand for
/s/ in the word. Add the spelling and the example word to the list.






|/s/:<br>1. ‘s’: sun<br>2. ‘ss’: kiss<br>3. ‘c’: cent<br>4. ‘se’: rinse<br>5. ‘ce’: prince|/w/:<br>1. ‘w’: win<br>2. ‘wh’: when|
|---|---|
|**/ng/:**<br>1.<br>‘ng’: sing<br>2.<br>‘n’: think|**/m/:**<br>1.<br>‘m’: map<br>2.<br>‘mm’: hammer|
|**/z/:**<br>1.<br>‘z’: zip<br>2.<br>‘zz’: jazz<br>3.<br>‘s’: pigs|**/n/:**<br>4.<br>‘n’: nut<br>5.<br>‘nn’: running<br>6.<br>‘kn’: knit|



**254**



Foundational Skills 6


**Show and Tell**


**Note:** This exercise can be done for any of the sounds taught in this unit.


 - The day before doing this exercise, ask students to bring in objects that
contain the /s/ sound, or pictures of things that contain the /s/ sound.


 - Ask each student to show and name their object.


 - Write each word on the board under a heading (e.g., all ‘s’ words under an ‘s’
heading, all ‘ss’ words under an ‘ss’ heading, all ‘c’ words under a ‘c’ heading,
all ‘se’ words under an ‘se’ heading, all ‘ce’ words under a ‘ce’ heading, and all
other /s/ spellings under an ‘odd ducks’ heading).


**Note:** Most of the words you will be writing will have /s/ spelled with one
of the spelling alternatives taught in this unit, but they may also contain
other spellings that students do not know yet, especially vowel spellings.
You should be prepared to explain any bits that are beyond students’ current
code knowledge. For example, if a student brings in a bottle of juice, you
would want to briefly explain that the ‘ui’ spelling in _juice_ stands for the
sound /oo/.


**Sound Dictation**


**Note:** This exercise can be done for any of the sounds/spellings taught so far.


 - Distribute whiteboards and dry-erase markers (or clipboards, paper, and
pencils) to students.


 - Tell students that they will practice writing the spellings of consonant sounds
they studied in Unit 6.


 - Say the sounds listed below and have the students write the spellings for
each sound. Tell students how many spellings to write for each sound.


 - Periodically, have students show you what they have written.


**Spellings Taught/Reviewed in Unit 6:**



1. /s/: (5) ‘s’, ‘ss’, ‘c’, ‘ce’, ‘se’


2. /z/: (3) ‘z’, ‘zz’, ‘s’


3. /m/: (2) ‘m’, ‘mm’



4. /n/: (3) ‘n’, ‘nn’, ‘kn


5. /ng/: (2) ‘ng’, ‘n’


6. /w/: (2) ‘w’, ‘wh’’



Pausing Point
**255**


**Highlight Spellings**


**Note:** This game is best played in small groups or in centers.


 - Write a number of decodable words that contain the consonant spellings

 - Ask students to read the words and highlight the letters of each new spelling.


**Possible Words:**



1. chance _(‘ce’)_


2. fence _(‘ce’)_


3. force _(‘ce’)_


4. ounce _(‘ce’)_


5. glimpse _(‘se’)_


6. sense _(‘se’)_


7. verse _(‘se’)_

12. knock _(‘kn’)_


13. wheezing _(‘wh’)_


14. whisk _(‘wh’)_


15. whether _(‘wh’)_


16. whine _(‘wh’)_




 - Make Bingo cards with the spellings taught/reviewed in Unit 6 and other
spellings that have been taught so far.


 - Write the same spellings on paper slips and put them in a box.


 - Give each student a Bingo card and playing pieces.


 - Explain that you will pull spellings from the box and that you want students to
put a playing piece on top of that spelling if it is on their bingo card.


 - Explain that when all spellings are covered on a card, students should
say, “Bingo!”


**Note:** Use locally approved free Bingo card generators.


**Spellings Taught/Reviewed in Unit 6:**



1. /s/: ‘s’, ‘ss’, ‘c’, ‘ce’, ‘se’


2. /z/: ‘z’, ‘zz’, ‘s’

 - Repeat until you have multiple examples of each spelling pattern.


 - If the students give you words that are not decodable, add them to the list
and point out the tricky parts of the word. For example, if a student says the
word _nurse_, you would want to briefly explain the ‘ur’ spelling for /er/.


 - If students give you words with /s/ spelled with a spelling different from the
ones taught, add an ‘odd duck’ column and explain that the spelling for /s/
has not been taught. For example, if a student says the word _science_, you
would want to add it to the ‘odd duck’ column and explain that ‘sc’ > /s/ has
not yet been taught.

~~**TRICKY WORD FAMILY LETTER**~~


Dear Family Member,


In this unit, your student will continue to learn new Tricky Words. Tricky Words are words that do
not follow the rules for encoding that your student has learned, so they simply must learn and
remember them. Remember any tricky parts are underlined. Your student will be taught to read only
one new Tricky Word: _cow_ (Lesson 23). You have been provided with flash cards that include the new
words learned in this unit. Your student should already be able to read all of the other words on the
flash cards successfully at the beginning of this unit, as they were taught in earlier units.


Please have your student cut out the flash cards. In order to build increasingly rapid, automatic
recognition of these words, show the cards to your student in random order and have them read
them to you as quickly as possible several time each week.

~~**TRICKY WORD ASSESSMENT RECORD: BEGINNING AND END OF UNIT 6 (OPTIONAL)**~~


This is an optional assessment of words from the Tricky Word List. At the beginning of Unit 6, show
the student the Tricky Word List that precedes this record.


Ask the student to read each word on the list from left to right, top to bottom. We suggest that you
provide students with either a blank sheet of paper or cardboard to place on the word list page
directly under the row to be read. As students complete a row, they can slide the paper down just
enough to read the next row.


Record each student’s performance in the following chart, using + to indicate that the word was
read correctly and – to indicate the word was read incorrectly; if the student misreads a completely
different word, record the word read by the student. Mark as incorrect any word that the student
does not read within 3–5 seconds. The goal is to learn all of these tricky words by the end of Unit 6.


**Repeat the assessment at the end of Unit 6.**

~~**LESSON 5: SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS AND ANALYSIS OF STUDENT ERRORS**~~


Write students’ names in the column provided. The words on today’s spelling assessment are
grouped according to spelling patterns on the analysis chart. Place an X in the column of any word
that the student did not spell correctly. Examine errors for patterns using the information provided
below. If a pattern is identified, speak with the student and ask them to explain their thinking
to you. This may help you to understand the student’s confusion and allow you to clear up the
misunderstanding. You may also use previous Pausing Points to address errors with today’s
spelling words.


The words on this week’s spelling assessment can be analyzed in many different ways. Below,
analyses that focus on errors in encoding consonant doublings in these words. Some of these
words are also two-syllable words, and you should take note of any difficulty students have
in encoding both syllables of two-syllable words. Please refer to the Unit 4 Appendix, “Using
Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words,” for more information on assisting students who have
difficulty with multisyllable words

that the student did not correctly identify. For each column, please mark the number of any question
answered incorrectly. Examine errors for patterns using the information provided below. If a pattern
is identified, speak with the student and ask them to explain their thinking to you. This may help you
to understand the student’s confusion and allow you to clear up the misunderstanding. You may also
use previous Pausing Points to address errors with today’s spelling words.


Literal


**What an error on these questions means:** Literal questions assess students’ recall of key details
from the story; these questions are text dependent, requiring students to paraphrase and/or refer
back to the portion of the text in which the specific answer to the question is provided.


**What you should do:** Remind students that they should always go back to the text to find an
answer. Most questions ask them to retell details from the text, and students should always find the
answer in the text and never skip this important step. Have students retell the plot of the story to
you in order.


Inferential


**What an error on these questions means:** Inferential questions ask students to infer information
from the text and think critically; these questions are also text dependent but require students to
paraphrase and/or refer back to the different portions of the text that provide information leading to
and supporting the inference they are making.


**What you should do:** Inferential questions ask students to come to a conclusion based on facts
and/or evidence from the text. These inferential questions ask students to use details from the
text to make connections and draw conclusions. In prompting students to answer these questions
correctly, first make sure students understand the story at a literal level. Then, lead students
in a discussion that uses the facts and details presented in the story to help students make the
inferences asked in the questions.


General Guidelines


Students scoring 7 or more are doing well. However, if you have students who score 6 or less on the
assessment, look for opportunities during the remainder of the unit to have these students read
aloud “The Prince Gets a Pet” to you and discuss each question with you.

Fluency: Play Parts “Ants”



**Ants**


Ì Grace came running home after class. She raced into
the kitchen.

**Grace:** “Mom! We got an ant farm for our classroom! It’s
made of plastic so you can see into it. You can look
inside and see what the ants are up to. You can see
them when they take bits of food back to their nest.
It is so cool because you get a glimpse into the lives
of ants.”

Ì Mom smiled and nodded. She was glad to see Grace
filled with excitement.

**Grace:** “Miss Francis says that ants are insects. All insects
have six legs. Bees and termites are insects, too! But
they are not as cool as ants! In fact, some ants can
lift objects that are one hundred times bigger than
they are.”

**Mom:** “Cool! What else did Miss Francis tell you?”

**Grace:** “Ants have a queen but not a king. The queen is the
top ant. She is the boss. The rest of the ants feed her
and take good care of her.”

**Mom:** “I like the sound of that!”

**The Storm**


Ì There is a big storm on the farm. Dark clouds have
blocked out the moon and stars. Thunder booms in the
darkness. Gusts of wind sweep past the barn. Grace is
not scared of the thunder. Jill is not as brave as Grace.
Jill yells in a scared voice. She winces when the thunder
booms. Her knees knock when the wind gusts.

**Grace:** “What’s the matter, Jill?”

**Jill:** “I’m scared!”

Ì Grace hugs her sister and sits next to her on the bed.

**Grace:** “It’s just a summer storm. We will be safe inside the
house.”

Ì Her big sister’s words make Jill feel better. The hug helps,
too. But there is still one thing that has her scared.

**Jill:** “The ducks! Will they be safe out in the storm?”

**Grace:** “Yes, those ducks are smart. When the thunder
booms, they scamper off and take shelter.”

**Jill:** “I am glad the ducks have a safe place to run in the
storm. That makes me feel better!”

**Grade 1 | Foundational Skills 6**
Appendix: Using Chunking to
Decode Multi-syllable Words


Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences taught in this program will enable students to
read one-syllable words with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences
is no guarantee that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multi-syllable words. To
this end, most students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk, and
read parts of words—syllables—as a way to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can then
be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated, and students are expected
to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, this program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the easiest
two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is already a
familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In addition, each
syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing_, _hunt·er_, _bust·ed_ ). The
dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain double-letter
spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed after the double-letter spelling rather than
between the two consonants (e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers familiar with other ways to
chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is done, however, because the double-letter
spellings have been taught as single-spelling units in the program since Kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/,
‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.). This program strives to be consistent in representing these spellings in
the way that the students have been taught to process them (e.g., as whole entities for a sound).
(Ultimately, as students become more proficient at decoding and chunking syllables through
subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually chunk and decode these
words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding these two-syllable words
consisting of root words and suffixes relatively easy.


A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multi-syllable words.
To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


Foundational Skills 6


  - **Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound**
**(e.g., /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/):** _pad,_ _let, tin, pic·nic, rod, fun, un·til_


  - **Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound**
**(e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /ie/, /oe/, /ue/):** _cake, mis·take, Pete, stam·pede,_ _like, home, mule_


  - **Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint, speak, proud, play, dis·may, be·low, coun·sel_


  - **R-Controlled Syllables:** _art, curb, girl, fort, clerk, tur·nip, ar·tist, fe·ver_


  - **Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound**
**(e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /ie/, /oe/, /ue/):** _a·pron, me, com·pre·hend, hi, fi·nal, go_


  - **Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple, puz·zle, raf·fe, ca·ble, ri·fe_


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


  - **Schwa Syllables:** _ben·e·fit, ap·pe·tite, a·bout, hos·pit·al, e·mo·tion_


**Note:** The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately because
of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


**To be clear, in order to decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these**
**names. The names of the syllable types are provided here only to establish a common**
**vocabulary for teachers as they use the materials.** For students to become fluent readers of
longer words in increasingly complex text, however, it is necessary that they be able to visually parse
certain spelling patterns as syllable chunks so they can quickly and easily decode each syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in Kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


  - When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.


_ad · mit_ _nap · kin_ _trum · pet_


Appendix
**423**


**424**




  - For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed after
the double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is because the
double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units in the program since Kindergarten
(‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).


_traff · ic_ _muff · in_ _happ · en_


  - When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.


_mon · ster_ _con · tract_ _pil · grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read the
first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model for
students how to blend the two syllables aloud:


In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the magic
‘E’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


  - Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for closed
syllables:


_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


In Grade 2, students are introduced to more challenging multi-syllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to use
a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying each
possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


Foundational Skills 6


  - When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:


_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_


However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There is
no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be flexible
and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to determine
whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. In order to recognize
whether a word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has
heard before (i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent
an additional challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a
second language.


  - If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:


_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is fairly straightforward.


Appendix
**425**


**426**




 - When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed, or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings in
the words


_ban · gle_ _twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_


In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings represent
the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a combination of stressed
and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed or weakly stressed, its
vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that linguists call a schwa.
This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’ and
‘tion’. Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite challenging for many
students.


 - Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the
schwa sound has a particular spelling:


_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is actually a schwa syllable, but it is identified
separately because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


 - Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables accordingly
throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _tri·cycle_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness_ _help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten—Grade
3, with the ability to chunk multi-syllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.

In order for the ELL to meet grade-level learning expectations across the foundation and enrichment curriculum, all<br>instruction delivered in English must be linguistically accommodated (communicated, sequenced, and scaffolded) commensurate<br>with the student’s level of English language proficiency. The student is expected to:|
|ELPS 3.A|practice producing sounds of newly acquired<br>vocabulary such as long and short vowels, silent letters,<br>and consonant clusters to pronounce English words in<br>a manner that is increasingly comprehensible|p. 232|
|ELPS 3.B|expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by<br>learning and using high-frequency English words<br>necessary for identifying and describing people, places,<br>and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic<br>information represented or supported by pictures,<br>and by learning and using routine language needed for<br>classroom communication||
|ELPS 3.C|speak using a variety of grammatical structures,<br>sentence lengths, sentence types, and connecting<br>words with increasing accuracy and ease as more<br>English is acquired|p. 72, p. 82, p. 92|
|ELPS 3.D|speak using grade-level content area vocabulary in<br>context to internalize new English words and build<br>academic language proficiency|p. 235|
|ELPS 3.E|share information in cooperative learning interactions||
|ELPS 3.F|ask and give information ranging from using a very<br>limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete<br>vocabulary, including key words and expressions<br>needed for basic communication in academic and<br>social contexts, to using abstract and content-based<br>vocabulary during extended speaking assignments||
