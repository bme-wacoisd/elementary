**Grade 1 Foundational Skills 3|**
Introduction


In Unit 3, you will introduce five additional vowel sounds and the most common spelling for
each sound:


  - /oo/ spelled ‘oo’ as in _soon_


  - /oo/ spelled ‘oo’ as in _look_


  - /ou/ spelled ‘ou’ as in _shout_


  - /oi/ spelled ‘oi’ as in _oil_


  - /aw/ spelled ‘aw’ as in _paw_


The sounds /oo/ and /oo/ are both spelled ‘oo’. Students will practice sounding out the tricky
spelling ‘oo’. A tricky spelling is a grapheme that can be pronounced more than one way.


~~**SIMILAR SOUNDS: /UE/, /OO/, /OO/, AND /U/**~~


The sounds /ue/, /oo/, /oo/, and /u/ sound very similar to some students and may potentially
cause confusion.


  - /ue/ as in _cute_ is a sound combination of the sounds /y/ + /oo/ and not a single phoneme. Some
students may confuse it with the /oo/ sound.


  - The sound /oo/ as in _soon_ is also somewhat similar to /oo/ as in _look_, and the fact that they share a
single spelling may contribute to potential confusion.


  - The sound /oo/ as in _look_ can be confused with /u/ as in _luck._


If you find that students are getting these sounds confused, you will need to spend extra time doing
oral discrimination exercises in which students listen for a particular sound or distinguish between
two similar sounds. The Pausing Point contains a variety of such exercises.


Introduction
**1**


~~**SIMILAR SPELLINGS FOR /UE/, /OO/, /OO/, AND /U/**~~


The sounds /ue/, /oo/, /oo/, and /u/ share a whole set of spellings, as you can see from the
following table. At the end of Unit 3, students will be familiar with the four bolded spellings below.

|Sound|/ue/|/oo/|/oo/|/u/|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Spellings|c**u**t**e**|tune|||
|Spellings||s**oo**n|b**oo**k||
|Spellings|pupil|super|put|p**u**tt|
|Spellings|cue|blue|||
|Spellings|few|new|||
|Spellings||prove||shove|
|Spellings||do||son|
|Spellings||soup||touch|
|Spellings||fruit|||
|Spellings||neutral|||



~~**CODE FLIP BOOKS AND INDIVIDUAL CODE CHARTS**~~


The Vowel Code Flip Book is used to teach the new vowel sound/spellings. The Spelling Cards are
added to the Code Flip Book when the sound/spellings are taught. Students will also fill out their
own Individual Code Charts. Please encourage students to use the Individual Code Chart when
reading
and writing.


~~**TRICKY WORDS**~~


In Unit 3, you will introduce the Tricky Words _should, would, could, down_, and _because_ . The vowel
sounds in _should, would_, and _could_ are tricky because they each have the /oo/ sound spelled ‘oul’.
The vowel sound in _down_ is tricky because the /ou/ sound is spelled ‘ow’. In the word _because_ the
first ‘e’ stands for the sound /ee/ (or the schwa sound), the letters ‘au’ for the sound /u/ (or /aw/),
and the letters ‘se’ for the sound /z/.


Foundational Skills 3
**2**


Once again, an optional Family Letter listing new Tricky Words along with flashcards for practice at
home is included in Teacher Resources. A list of all Tricky Words taught thus far and an assessment
record are also included for your use. It is highly recommended that you assess each student at the
beginning and end of the unit.


Once these words have been introduced, they will be included in the stories and in other materials.
The tricky part of each word will be underlined for the first twenty or so occurrences in the Reader.
Tricky Words from previous units will continue to be underlined until they have appeared at least
twenty times.


You may wish to have a word wall to display Tricky Words. Tricky Words should be printed on yellow
cards to remind students to use caution when reading them.


~~**TRICKY SPELLINGS**~~


In Unit 3, students learn that both /oo/ as in _soon_ and /oo/ as in _look_ can be spelled ‘oo’.
When students come across a word containing the spelling ‘oo’, they should:


  - Try pronouncing it as /oo/ as in _soon_ . This is the more common pronunciation.


  - If that pronunciation does not sound right, or does not make sense in context, they should try
pronouncing the spelling /oo/ as in _look_ .


Some teachers use an extra visual cue to help students distinguish /oo/ and /oo/. For words that
have ‘oo’ pronounced like _look_, they draw two eyes looking out from the ‘oo’ spelling like this:


Use this visual if you think it would be helpful to students.


Introduction
**3**


~~**DECODABLE READER: FABLES**~~


Students will practice newly learned decoding skills while reading stories from _Fables_ . This Reader
is comprised of decodable versions of famous fables, most of which are originally attributable to
the ancient Greek storyteller Aesop. Fables are special types of stories that teach important lessons
or morals. Fables often feature talking animals as main characters. You should continue to observe
and document student reading performance, using the Anecdotal Reading Record provided in the
Teacher Resources section of this Teacher Guide. As in the previous Grade 1 materials, you are
encouraged to use the Reader in a variety of instructional groupings, including whole group and/
or small group instruction, partner reading, and independent reading. Each story is accompanied
by a set of discussion questions in the Teacher Guide, focusing on literal, inferential, and evaluative
question types. Regardless of the process or groupings used to read each story, it is highly
recommended that you gather all students back together to discuss the story questions when they
have finished reading.


Students will also continue to complete story question activity pages. As you assess students’
writing on these activity pages, you are encouraged to accept all phonetically plausible spellings.
You should, for the time being, accept _hou_ for _how_, _bloo_ for _blue_, and _toi_ for _toy_, as students have not
yet learned the spelling alternatives they need to spell such words correctly.


~~**GRAMMAR**~~


The grammar exercises in this unit focus on verb identification and verb tense. Students will
practice identifying whether a verb represents an action that is happening in the present or one that
happened in the past.


~~**SPELLING**~~


Weekly spelling lists and assessments are included for the first time in Unit 3. The spelling words are
made up of various sound/spelling correspondences that have already been presented and taught
for decoding purposes. Requiring students to practice and spell words with these same sound/
spelling correspondences provides additional reinforcement.


The student Activity Book includes take-home letters with the list of words to be practiced in
preparation for the end-of-week spelling assessment. It is important to note that encoding (spelling)
poses a far greater challenge for students than decoding (reading) the same sound/spelling
correspondences, so practice at home is important.


The Teacher Resources section also includes a useful spelling analysis sheet for each spelling
assessment. Careful examination of students’ errors may provide insight for planning remediation
of both decoding and encoding skills.


Foundational Skills 3
**4**


Students will also create a Dictation Journal that focuses on spelling words in isolation as well as
in sentences. Spelling assessments will incorporate a phrase or sentence that students must
spell correctly.


  - For the dictation journal, you can either have students use a journal they use for other writing
activities or you may wish to create a small dictation journal for each student. Stapling five pieces of
paper together is all you will need for each journal. (1)


~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit, formal instruction in the writing process begins by focusing on narrative writing. Early
lessons call for students to practice retelling a previously read story, incorporating key story
features by identifying the setting, describing the characters, and then recounting a sequential
series of events from the plot. Students progress from writing a simple narrative retelling to writing
a book report, in which they are also encouraged to include their opinion about the story that they
have read.


All writing activities are presented in carefully scaffolded steps, modeled first by the teacher
with the group, followed by additional student practice, with a gradual release of responsibility so
students learn how to plan, draft, and edit pieces of writing. This unit also introduces a classroom
visitor named Mr. Mowse, who leaves samples of his writing in the classroom overnight for students
to edit the next day.


A note with regard to expectations regarding spelling accuracy during these writing activities is
warranted. While students will have learned many sound/spellings by the end of this unit, there
are still some basic code spellings, as well as quite a few spelling alternatives, that remain to be
taught in Grades 1 and 2. Students should be encouraged to use their existing code knowledge to
spell and write the words they want to use. Plausible, but not dictionary correct spellings, like _hunee_
for _honey_, should be accepted at this point, though they can be corrected if written work is being
prepared for “publication.”


Writing is one of the most tangible ways that teachers and students can gauge progress. Students
enjoy looking back at their writing from time to time throughout the year to see how much they have
grown as writers. For this reason, you should keep a portfolio of writing samples for each student. In
addition, this portfolio will enable you to quickly review each student’s writing and analyze areas in
need of attention.


Here are some suggestions to create and maintain student portfolios:


  - Allow each student to decorate a plain manila file folder. Keep the folders in a safe spot. Each time
students write, file their work in their folder.


Introduction
**5**


     - Create a three-ring binder for each student. Then, hole-punch their writing and place in the notebook.


     - If your school has a binder machine, bind a large number of sheets of blank copy paper. Bind a piece
of construction paper to the front and allow students to decorate it.


     - Consult with other teachers in your school to see if there are other ideas that might work well for
your class.


You will be prompted in Lessons 6, 7, and 8 to collect specific samples of student writing.


**Left-Handed Handwriting Guidance**

     - Consider your seating arrangement for left-handed students. The placement of the arms and elbows
in relation to other students can impact their writing space.


     - Encourage your students to hold their writing tools correctly to reduce hand strain. Allow time for
students to develop their hand strength in writing.


     - Providing pencil grips for students could alleviate the strain on their hands when writing.


     - Orienting the paper at an angle can help left-handed students write more easily and comfortably.
Consider using paper with a raised line for students to rest their hands on as they write.


~~**UNIT 3 ASSESSMENTS**~~


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


In addition to the weekly spelling assessments, formative assessments are clearly marked for
monitoring individual student performance and progress in the following key skills:


     - Oral reading of decodable stories: Observation records for recording student performance in the
form of an Anecdotal Reading Record and Discussion Questions Observation Record are included
in Teacher Resources.


     - Written responses to story comprehension questions: You will be prompted to collect and review
activity book pages for specific lessons.


     - Sound/spellings taught in this unit—/oo/ > ‘oo,’ /oo/ > ‘oo,’ /ou/ > ‘ou,’ /oi/ > ‘oi,’ and /aw/ > ‘aw’:
Again you will be prompted to collect specific activity pages.


Quick “Checks for Understanding” to evaluate classroom performance as a whole are also
designated in various lessons.


Careful attention to this information, collected on a daily basis, will enable teachers to quickly
determine which students may benefit from reteaching and/or more practice in particular skills
using the Additional Support activities found at the end of each lesson.


Foundational Skills 3
**6**


**Student Performance Assessment**


In Lesson 19, you will be prompted to administer a multipart assessment. In the Word Recognition
Assessment, students will be asked to look at several words on the designated activity page and
then circle the written word which matches the spoken word you say. The target words include the
vowel sound/spellings taught in this unit; distractors have been intentionally selected because they
represent frequent sound/spelling confusions. Student performance on this assessment is a good
indicator of whether students have mastered the new sound/spellings.


Students will also be asked to independently read a new story in _Fables_ and then answer written
comprehension questions about the selection.


~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice the Unit 3 skills can be found in
the Pausing Point section included after the last lesson if you need to provide targeted remediation
for individual or groups of students in any areas in which they performed poorly on the end-of-unit
assessment.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


In the Teacher Resources section at the end of this Teacher Guide, you will find forms and charts
which may be useful, including the following:


  - Tricky Word Family Letter


  - Tricky Word Flash Cards


  - Tricky Word Assessment Record: Beginning and End of Unit 3 (optional)

Found ~~at~~ ional Skills


**Primary Focus**
Students will listen to and distinguish words with /oo/ and /ue/ vowel sounds in
oral word pairs. ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.iii; TEKS 1.2.A.v**~~


Students will read and write one-syllable words spelled with the vowel digraph
/oo/> ‘oo’. ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iii**~~


~~**MINIMAL PAIRS /OO/ AND /UE/ (5 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** This first activity is a listening only activity that focuses on the sound
differences between /oo/ and /ue/. Many of the word pairs on the next page use
spellings that have not been taught. Do not write these words for students to read.


  - Tell students that today they will learn a new sound—/oo/ as in _soon_ .


  - Have students say the /oo/ sound several times, stretching it out.


  - Ask students if they can think of words that have the /oo/ sound in the
middle ( _spoon, loop, root, hoop, boot_ ). Have the class repeat the words and
verify that the sound /oo/ is in the middle.


  - Ask students if they can think of words that have the /oo/ sound at the end
( _zoo, two, blue, moo, shoe_ ). Have the class repeat each word and verify that
the /oo/ sound is at the end.


  - Ask students whether /oo/ is a vowel sound or a consonant sound. (It is a
vowel sound, made with an open mouth and an unobstructed airflow.)


  - Explain that when listening to words, it can be hard to hear the difference
between the /oo/ sound as in _soon_ and the /ue/ sound as in _cute_, which they
learned to read and spell in Unit 2.


  - Ask students to say /oo/ several times.


  - Ask them to say /ue/ several times.


**TEKS 1.2.A** Demonstrate phonological awareness by (iii) distinguishing between long and short vowel sounds in one-syllable

Foundational Skills 3


- Tell students that you are going to say word pairs. The words may sound
similar, but only one word will contain the /oo/ sound and the other word will
contain the /ue/ sound.


- Have students close their eyes and listen as you say the first word pair.


- Ask students which word contains the /oo/ sound.


- Have students repeat both words to hear and feel the difference
in articulation.

**Note:** Many of these words may be unfamiliar to students. The purpose of this
activity is for students to listen for the different sounds in each word, not to learn
new vocabulary. However it may be helpful to pause after each word and use it in
a sentence so students understand that two different words are being said.


Check for Understanding


Say the word pair _moon—boots_ . Ask students if they hear the /oo/ sound in both

words. Have the class use **Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down** to indicate if they hear the

/oo/ sound in both words. Discuss the correct answer with the class. _(thumbs-up)_

Then, say the word pair _cube—room_ . Ask students if they hear the /oo/ sound in

both words. Have the class use **Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down** to indicate if they hear

the /oo/ sound in both words. Discuss the correct answer with the class _(thumbs-_

_down)_, as well as which word has the /oo/ sound ( _room_ ).


~~**INTRODUCE THE SPELLING /OO/ › ‘OO’ (15 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iii**~~


  - Tell students that you are going to show them how to write the vowel
sound /oo/.


  - Write ‘oo’ on handwriting guidelines and describe what you are doing.


**TEKS 1.2.B.iii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe
syllables; vowel teams, including vowel digraphs and diphthongs; and r-controlled syllables.



Support


To help students understand
the sound / oo/, say the
following word pairs aloud,
one pair at a time: _moon—_
_man; boot—bet; lip—loop;_
_rim—room_ . Ask students to
repeat the words. Then, have
students choose the word
in each pair with the /oo/
sound.


Challenge


Ask students to think of
other word pairs with /oo/
and /ue/. Have individual
students say the word pairs
to the class and ask which
word has the /oo/ sound.

Code Materials


Activity Page 1.1




  - State that the /oo/ sound is spelled as a vowel team, ‘oo’. Model writing and
saying the spelling two or three times.


  - Have students trace the spelling on their desk with a pointed finger while
saying the sound.


Check for Understanding


Walk around as students trace the ‘oo’ on their desks and listen to make sure that

students are making the correct /oo/ sound.


  - Write ‘f’ and ‘ff’ on the board/chart paper, and explain that ‘f’ and ‘ff’ are
pronounced the same way. Write the words _if_ and _stiff_, asking students to
read both words to confirm that ‘f’ and ‘ff’ are both pronounced as /f/.


  - Explain that the spellings for vowel sounds are different. Write ‘o’ and ‘oo’ on
the board/chart paper.


  - Point to the ‘o’ spelling and explain that when they see one ‘o’, they should
say the /o/ sound as in _pop_ .


  - Point to the ‘oo’ spelling and explain that when they see the double-letter
spelling ‘oo’, they should say the /oo/ sound as in _soon_ .


  - Turn to **Vowel Code Flip Book page 11** . Show students the Spelling Card
for /oo/ > ‘oo’ ( _soon_ ). Discuss the power bar and have a student read the
example word. Attach the Spelling Card to the appropriate space.


  - Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart page 4** . Have them locate
and trace the code information for /oo/ > ‘oo’ in green marker. Make sure
students are outlining the card with _soon_ as the example word.


  - Tell students that whenever the spelling ‘oo’ appears on an activity page or
in a story for the next few lessons, it will be printed in darker, bolder ink to
remind them that the two letters stand for a single sound.


~~**PRACTICE /OO/ › ‘OO’ (10 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iii**~~

 - Show students the cover of their new Reader, _Fables_, and point to and read
the title. Have students repeat the title of the Reader after you. Note that the
Reader title, _Fables_, is not decodable; however individual story titles are.


 - Ask students what they know about fables. Explain that a fable is a fictional,
or made-up, short story. Look at the table of contents together, and note that
many of the titles include animals. This is because the characters of fables
(who the stories are about) are often animals that can speak and think like
humans. Fables also try to teach a lesson, or a moral. For example, the fable
“The Boy Who Cried Wolf” teaches us to always tell the truth.


 - Again call students’ attention to the table of contents. Point to the first
story, and read the title of today’s story, “The King Frog and the Big Ox.” Tell
students that an ox is a bull that has been tamed for the purpose of doing
farm work.

~~**INTRODUCE TRICKY WORD: BECAUSE (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Write the Tricky Word _because_ on the board/chart paper and ask students
how they would pronounce it by blending. (They might say something like
/b/ /e/ /k/ /a/ /u/ /s/ /e/ or they may simply not know how to approach
decoding a multisyllable word.)


 - Explain that we pronounce this word /b/ /ee/ /k/ /u/ /z/ as in, “I like apples
because they are crunchy.”


 - Tell students that learning the word _because_ will help them with their writing.


 - Circle the letter ‘b’ and the letter ‘c’ and explain that they are pronounced just
as one would expect, as /b/ and /k/.


 - Underline the letter ‘e’, the letters ‘au’, and the letters ‘se’, and explain that
these are the tricky parts. The ‘e’ stands for the /ee/ sound. The letters ‘au’
stand for the /u/ sound, and the letters ‘se’ stand for the /z/ sound.


 - Tell students that when reading _because_, they have to learn and remember
that the entire word is pronounced /b/ /ee/ /k/ /u/ /z/.


**Note:** _Because_ can be pronounced /b/ /ee/ /k/ /aw/ /z/, /b/ /ee/ /k/ /u/
/z/, or /b/ /u/ /k/ /u/ /z/. The variations in the pronunciation of _because_ are
due in part to syllable stress.

  - Ask students to count the sounds and then draw a line on their paper for
each sound that they hear. For example, for the word _broom_, four lines would
be drawn on the paper: .


  - Once students have drawn one line for each sound, remind them that the
sound /oo/ is spelled with two letters.


  - Have students write the spellings on their respective lines: b r oo m.


  - Finally, ask students to read the word back to you.


  - Continue with the rest of the words.


  - Write the words on the board/chart paper and have students self-correct.


**Note:** It might be useful to have students use a different-colored pencil for
self-correction, allowing you to see which spellings students need
to practice.

**Primary Focus:** Students will follow along as the teacher reads “The King Frog and
the Big Ox”; will be introduced to the three-step writing process of plan, draft, and
edit; and will fill out a story map to use in planning a draft of a written retelling of the
story. ~~**TEKS 1.8.B; TEKS 1.11.A; TEKS 1.12.A**~~


Students will identify key plot elements, including the story’s main events,
problem, and resolution as they read independently. ~~**TEKS 1.8.C**~~

 - Explain that this chart shows three steps that good writers use when
they write. Authors of their favorite books use these steps to help create
their stories.


 - Point to the _plan_ step on the chart. Ask students what the person in the
picture is doing. _(thinking)_


 - Explain that before you begin writing, you have to think about the topic
you want to write about and brainstorm, or come up with, ideas. This is
called planning.


 - Point to the _draft_ step on the chart. Ask students what this picture shows.
_(paper and pencil)_


 - Explain that the next part of the writing process is to start organizing and
writing down ideas on paper in complete sentences. This is called drafting,
or writing a draft.


 - Point to the _edit_ step on the chart. Ask students what this picture shows.
_(paper and eraser)_


**Note:** The word _edit_ is a multisyllable word with decodable chunks. Students
have not yet learned how to decode multisyllable words, but will learn to do
so in the next unit.


 - Explain that the last part of the process is to reread the draft, fix any
mistakes, and/or think of better ways to say and write your ideas. This is
called editing.


 - Review the three steps of the writing process one more time by pointing to
each icon and asking students to name each step.


**Narratives**

 - Tell students that today you will work as a class to complete the first step of
the writing process—plan—to think about the story they read yesterday and
retell it together, in a type of writing called a narrative.


 - Explain that a narrative tells events of a story in order. It includes details
about what happened in the story.


Foundational Skills 3


**Review of Story Elements and Introduce Story Map** ~~**TEKS 1.8.C**~~

 - Remind students that they have been talking about the terms _characters,_
_setting_, and _plot_ since they first heard stories read aloud in Kindergarten.
Now they are going to use these same terms to organize their ideas as they
think about writing a story, using a planning template known as a story map.


 - Display the blank story map you prepared prior to this lesson.



.



**Digital Component 2.2**



|What?|Once, there wearse . . . . ..|
|---|---|
|**What?**|~~**Next in the tale . . .**~~<br>|
|**What?**|~~**At the end of the tale . . .**~~|



  - Point to the story map, read the words in each section, and discuss which
plot elements belong in each section.


  - The first section at the top says, “The Name of the Tale.” The name of the tale
is the title of the story or fable. The title is written in bold at the top of the first
page of each tale. Tell students that the word _tale_ is another word for _story_ or
_fable_ . Students will use the word _tale_ to refer to the story in their writing since
_tale_ is decodable.


  - The next two sections of the template ask, “Who?” and “Where?” Information
about the characters and setting of the tale will go in these boxes. Tell
students that it is best to use words right from the tale to describe the
characters and setting, as they are still beginning writers. Feel free to use the
terms _characters_ and _setting_ with students orally, but please model writing
using only decodable words.


**TEKS 1.8.C** Describe plot elements, including the main events, the problem, and the resolution, for texts read aloud and
independently.

 - The “What?” (or plot) section is broken into three sections. Students should
retell what happened in the tale, from beginning to middle to end. The story
map provides students with transition words and sentence starters that
will help them sequence the events. For now, students should focus on
identifying just three main events to retell the plot of the tale.


 - Tell students that today they will use this story map to retell the story
“The King Frog and the Big Ox.”


**Analysis of Elements of a Fictional Story**

 - Explain that you will reread “The King Frog and the Big Ox” aloud while
students follow along in their Readers, paying special attention to the name
of the tale (title), the who (characters), the where (setting), as well as what
happens in the tale at once (beginning), next (middle), and at the end.


 - Reread “The King Frog and the Big Ox” aloud and have students follow along
in their Readers as you do so.


 - While reading the story, draw attention to the difference between narrative
text and dialogue. Remind students that dialogue is the part of the story
where the characters speak. Point out the quotation marks used to mark
the exact words a character is speaking.


 - After reading the story, have students look at Activity Page 2.1. Explain that
this activity page is a story map just like the story map on display.


 - Tell students that you will fill in the story map on the board/chart paper at the
same time that they fill in their activity pages. You will try to use only words
from the story to fill out the story map.


 - Explain that since students are in Grade 1, there are still many words that
they have not yet learned to spell. If they want to write a word that is not in
the story, they should try to sound out and write the word as best as they
can, based on the spellings they know. Assure students that this
is acceptable.


 - Start first by asking students the name of the tale, or title of the story.
Encourage them to copy the name of the tale from their Reader as you write
it on the board/chart paper.


 - In the “Who?” section, discuss the frogs, King Frog, and the big ox as
characters.


 - In the “Where?” section, discuss the setting. Encourage students to name
where the tale is set and provide at least one detail about what the setting is
like. _(a cool pool with grass)_


Foundational Skills 3



**32**


  - In the “What?” section, remind students that the plot of a story can be
divided into a beginning, middle, and end. Ask students to tell you what
happened in the beginning of the story and then model writing this using
the “Once there was . . .” sentence starter. Model writing the following short
notes, elaborating more fully as you talk through each point:


    - big ox


    - hit the King Frog


    - got stuck


  - Continue discussing and writing about the middle and the end of the story,
using the “Next in the tale . . .” and “At the end of the tale . . .” sentence
starters. Write short notes, not complete sentences. Emphasize that it is very
important to write what happened in the correct order. Finish by pointing out
how the story ends.


  - Tell students that in the next lesson, they will use the story map to help
them rewrite the story. Save the completed story map for use in the
next lesson.

 - Students echo the word and then individually work to select the letter cards
for the sound/spellings identified as they segment the word into phonemes.


Foundational Skills 3


- Have students place the Letter Cards directly below the boxes in the
correct positions from left to right. Tell students they will not always use
all the sound boxes.


- Once you see a student is ready, ask that student to push the cards into
the boxes from left to right and say the sound as each letter card is pushed.
Immediately, students should run their finger under the word in one smooth
motion and say the whole word blended.

**Code Knowledge**



Before today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
528 and 688 of those words would be completely decodable.


After today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
529 and 689 of those words would be completely decodable.


_Because_ is one of the 200 most common words in most samples of written English.

- Tell students that you are going to help them give a summary of today’s
story. When we summarize, we retell just the important parts of the story,
and not every single detail. A summary tells who was in the story and the
main events.


- What happens first in “The Two Dogs?” _(A wild dog and a tame dog meet. )_


- What does the wild dog notice about the tame dog? _(The tame dog is plump.)_


- What does the wild dog ask the tame dog? _(Why are you plump and I_
_am skinny?)_


- How does the tame dog answer? _(He says that he is fed food because he_
_keeps the home where he lives safe.)_


Foundational Skills 3


 - How does the story end? _(The wild dog notices a spot on the tame dog’s neck._
_He learns that the tame dog is kept on a rope. The wild dog does not want a_
_rope around his neck, so he runs away to be free.)_


**Discussion Questions for “The Two Dogs”**


1. Were there any parts of the story that were confusing to you?


» Answers may vary.


2. **Inferential.** The tame dog says his job is to keep the men safe when they sleep at
home. What do you think the dog does to keep the men safe?


» The answer is not in the text, but might be that the dog barks if he
hears noises.


3. **Inferential.** Why does the free dog think at first that the tame dog has a fine or
easy life?


» The men he lives with feed him scraps of food so he is plump and
not hungry.


4. **Inferential.** Why do you think the free dog is thin?


» The answer is not in the text, but might be that the free dog has to find his own
food in the wild and he also gets a lot of exercise.


5. **Evaluative.** What do you think is the lesson, or moral, of today’s story? What part of
the story can you use to support your answer?


» Answers may vary, but may reflect the “be careful what you wish for” or “the
grass is always greener on the other side” lesson. Explain that one dog thinks it’s
better to be free and do what you want, even if your life is a little harder, rather
than being tied up and not doing what you want.

display your writing). Explain that you will write the draft in paragraph format.
Also display the completed story map nearby.


  - Write the name of the tale (“The King Frog and the Big Ox”) at the top of the
page. Tell students that it is important to title their writing. Point out that the
name of the tale is written on Activity Page 2.1 and the class story map.


  - Next, tell students that the first sentence of the draft should introduce the
who and where of the tale, or the characters and setting. Model how to indent
the first sentence of a paragraph, using your pointer finger to determine
spacing. (You may need to use more than one finger for the display copy.)
Use this decodable sentence starter: _In the tale, “The King Frog and the Big_
_Ox,” there was . . ._

- Have students consult the story map and Activity Page 2.1 to decide how to
finish the sentence starter. For example: _In the tale, “The King Frog and the Big_
_Ox,” there was a big ox who made the King Frog get stuck in the cool pool._


- Encourage students to use words and phrases from the tale. Many Tricky
Words have already been introduced and will be useful in linking these words
and phrases into new sentences; students may refer to the Tricky Word Wall.

  - Write the first sentence of the paragraph on the board/chart paper. For
example: _In the tale, “The King Frog and the Big Ox,” a big ox made the King_
_Frog get stuck in the cool pool._ Point out that the sentence starts with a
capital letter and ends with a punctuation mark.


  - Work with students to transform the notes on the story map/Activity
Page 2.1 into the second, third, and fourth sentences. The story map
provides students with sentence starters for the three body sentences of the
paragraph. You may use those or choose from the decodable linking words
below. For example: _Once, a big ox made the King Frog get stuck in a cool pool._
_A small frog asked where King Frog was. Next the frogs made puffs to show_
_how big the ox was. Last, the King Frog made puffs until he popped._


**Note:** Be sure to use the following decodable linking words to describe the
sequence of events ( _once_ / _one time_, _next_, _then_, _last_, etc.).

 - As you transcribe the oral sentences provided by students, ask them to
remind you how sentences begin _(with a capital letter)_ and end _(with a_
_punctuation mark)_ . Remind them that the pronoun _I_ is always capitalized.


 - Tell students that the ending sentence of the story should wrap up the story
and let the reader know it is finished. This is a good place to remind students
that this particular tale is a fable. A good way to end the paragraph is to
explain what the tale tells us, or the moral of the fable. For example: _This tale_
_tells us not to try impossible things._


 - Write the ending sentence on the board/chart paper.


 - Remind students that drafting is the second step in the writing process.
In the draft they helped compose as a group today, they wrote a starting
sentence that introduced the characters and setting, the next sentences
that retold the order of the events in the plot, and an ending sentence that
wrapped up the story by saying what the tale tells us or what we liked or did
not like about the story.


 - Tell students that in the next lesson, they will edit the story.

Call on different students to make oral contributions for each sentence to
help monitor their understanding of writing sentences for the narrative.

Foundational Skills 3


  - Review with students how they planned and then drafted a retelling of “The
King Frog and the Big Ox” as a class. Ask individual students to tell you what
they did. _(planned the elements of the story on a story map; used the story_
_map to orally transform the notes into complete sentences; wrote the draft on_
_the board/chart paper; discussed the characters and what happened in the_
_beginning, then the middle, and the end of the story._


- **Digital Components 4.1, 4.2**


  - Tell students that when you came into the classroom today, you found
another draft of a story that seems to have appeared overnight. Point to
the copy you created in advance of Mr. Mowse’s draft. Tell students that
this story was written by Mr. Mowse and show them his picture, which you
prepared in advance.


  - Explain that Mr. Mowse is a very shy character who likes to listen to the class
instruction during the writing lessons. He then likes to try to write the same
things they are learning. He is so shy, though, that he waits until everyone
goes home to leave what he has written for the students to find the next day.
Mr. Mowse likes to write, but he needs some help with editing.


  - Read Mr. Mowse’s draft aloud. Some students may immediately notice some
errors. Explain that this is what you will fix when you edit Mr. Mowse’s draft.


  - Point to the writing process graphic, and explain that today they will work on
the third step in the writing process: edit. Explain that editing is what we do
when we take a draft and try to make it better. Even professional writers do
not write perfect stories on the first try. They edit and rework their writing to
make it better.


  - Read the display copy of the editing checklist with students, noting that this
checklist is completely decodable so students can read it, too.


- **Digital Component 4.3**


1. Check that the _name of the tale_ is there.

Explicitly model how to
use the steps to check
the draft. Make sure
students understand
what to look for in each
step. In addition, make
sure students understand
why certain parts of
the draft need to be
fixed (missing capital
letters at the beginning
of sentences, missing
quotation marks when
characters are speaking,
misspelled words).


**56**




 - Explain that this is an editing checklist that has steps that someone editing a
draft needs to check to make the writing in the draft better.


 - Read the first step of the checklist.


 - Ask the class if Mr. Mowse’s draft has the name of the tale, or a title. _(yes)_
Then make a check mark next to that step on the editing checklist.


 - Work through the remaining steps and discuss whether the item can be
checked off; if not, talk about what improvements could be made. Model
making any changes to the draft that the class agrees would be changes for
the better. For example, ask students if there are places where details could
be added, perhaps better describing the characters, places, or things that
happen in the story.


**Note:** For item 5 in the checklist, prompt students to check if capital letters
are used correctly; for example at the beginning of a sentence. For item 6,
prompt students to check if the correct punctuation is used.


 - Use the following editing conventions when correcting the draft. Emphasize
these conventions, explaining that this is how professional writers edit their
work. Explain that students will use these very same marks when they edit
their own work. Descriptions of these editing marks are presented here for
your convenience.


**Teacher Resource: Editing Marks**


1. Cross out punctuation mistakes and write the correct punctuation mark above the
wrong one.


2. Cross out capitalization mistakes and write the correct uppercase/lowercase letter
above the wrong one.


3. Write a caret (^) where a word or punctuation mark needs to be inserted. Write the
word or punctuation mark above the caret.


4. Correct spelling mistakes if students notice or question them. You should accept
plausible spellings that use the sound/spelling correspondences taught thus far.


 - Ask students if they have any other suggestions that would improve
Mr. Mowse’s writing. Explain that students should make any suggestions by
asking a question.


 - Model this by asking, “What if we tried . . . ?” or “Could we make the writing
even better by . . . ?” Using this phrasing will make it clear that students are
making suggestions for consideration, rather than mandating changes that
must be made.


Foundational Skills 3


  - If changes are suggested, check with the class to see if everyone agrees.
Make the changes on the draft. At this stage, one or two suggestions are
probably enough.


  - Summarize by saying that students have now completed the three steps in
the writing process: plan, draft, and edit.


  - Ask students to talk about the steps they completed (planned their story on
the story map on Activity Page 2.1, by specifying the title, characters, setting,
and plot; drafted their story by writing the information from the plan onto
board/chart paper; edited a draft by using an editing checklist and making
changes to a draft to make it better).


**Copying the Edited Draft—An Extra Step**

  - When you have finished editing Mr. Mowse’s draft, explain that if an author
wants to share their writing so other people can read it, there is one extra
step that they might want to take.


  - Ask, “Do you think it would be easy or difficult for someone other than the
author to read this draft? Why?”


  - Explain that to share an edited draft with other people, it should be copied
onto a clean piece of paper, incorporating all of the changes made on the
draft. Let the class know that today you will not recopy Mr. Mowse’s draft.

 - Once students are confident in their pronunciation and can say the sounds
clearly, have them say all five sounds front to back while using the gestures:
/i/, /e/, /a/, /u/, /o/ (from the front of the mouth /i/ to the back of the
mouth /o/). Then have them say the sounds back to front while using the
gestures: /o/, /u/, /a/, /e/, /i/.


 - Show a gesture and ask students for the short vowel sound.


 - Say a short vowel sound and ask students to show you the gesture.

  - Have students tear out Activity Page 5.1.


  - Tell students that this is the one time during the week that they will not be
allowed to consult their Individual Code Chart.


  - Read the first spelling word aloud, use it in a sentence, and then read the
word once more, allowing students time to write down the word.


  - Repeat this procedure with each of the remaining words.


  - At the end, go back through the list and read each spelling word one
more time.

Check for Understanding


Scan the word cards that students hold up in response to each word you say.


~~**INTRODUCE THE SOUND /OO/ (10 MIN.)**~~


**I’m Thinking of Something**


**Note:** Be careful not to confuse the /oo/ sound as in _look_ in this lesson with
the /oo/ sound in _soon_ that was practiced in earlier lessons.


 - Tell students that today they will listen for a new sound, /oo/, as in _look_ .


 - Have students say the /oo/ sound several times.


 - Ask students to repeat a number of words that have the /oo/ sound in the
middle: _foot, cook, hook, hood, book, look_ .


 - Ask students if /oo/ is a vowel sound or a consonant sound. _(Vowel sound,_
_made with an open mouth and an unobstructed airflow.)_


 - Tell students that you are thinking of a word that has /oo/ as its middle
sound; you want them to guess what it is, but first you will give them a clue.


 - Read the first clue and see if anybody can guess the answer. If students are
stumped, read the second clue.


**Cook**


1. I’m thinking of someone who works in the kitchen.


2. This person makes yummy food.


 - Once students guess the answer and say the word, have them isolate and say
the /oo/ sound once more.

~~**INTRODUCE THE SPELLING /OO/ › ‘OO’ (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that you are going to show them how to write the vowel
sound /oo/.


 - Write ‘oo’ on handwriting guidelines and describe what you are doing.


 - Explain that the two letters work together as a team to stand for the
/oo/ sound.


 - Model writing the spelling two or three times.


 - Have students trace the spelling on their desks with a pointed finger while
saying the sound.


 - Ask the class if they notice anything interesting about this spelling. _(It is the_
_same spelling as for /oo/.)_


 - Remind students that they have already learned some spellings that can be
pronounced different ways; for example, the letter ‘s’ can be pronounced /s/
or /z/, as in _cats_ and _dogs_ . The spelling ‘oo’ is similar in that it also has two
possible pronunciations: /oo/ and /oo/.


Foundational Skills 3


 - Point to the ‘oo’ spelling and explain that today, when students see the
double-letter spelling ‘oo’, they should say the /oo/ sound as in _cook_ .


 - Turn to **Vowel Code Flip Book page 12** . Show students the Spelling Card
for ‘oo’ > /oo/ ( _look_ ). Discuss the power bar and have a student read the
example word. Attach the Spelling Card to the appropriate space.


**Vowel Code Flip Book**


1. ‘oo’ > /oo/ ( _look_ ) **page 12**


 - Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart page 4** . Have them trace the
code information for ‘oo’ > /oo/ in green marker.


 - Tell students that whenever the spelling ‘oo’ appears on an activity page or
in a story for the next few lessons, it will be printed in darker, bolder ink to
remind them that the two letters stand for a single sound.


~~**PRACTICE /OO/ › ‘OO’ (10 MIN.)**~~


**Write the Spelling/Word Box**

 - Distribute Activity Page 5.2.


 - Write the /oo/ spelling on the board/chart paper. Remind students that ‘oo’
is a letter team.


 - Tell students to say the sound of each letter team and single-letter spelling
that they write, going sound by sound to write the words.


 - Look at the back of the activity page together as a class.


 - Read the words in the box at the top of the activity page, and name the
pictures below.


 - Tell students to write the correct word underneath the picture. Review the
activity page together as a class.


- **Digital Component 1.1**


 - To summarize, write the spelling ‘oo’ on the second line of the vowel digraph
chart you created in Lesson 1. Review that they have just learned that the
spelling ‘oo’ can stand for the /oo/ sound. Ask students for several examples
of words in which ‘oo’ stands for /oo/ and add them to the chart. Students
may notice that the spelling ‘oo’ can represent two different sounds.



Support


One way to show the
difference between /oo/
and /oo/ is to draw two
small eyes inside the ‘oo’
for /oo/, as in _look_ .

~~**MORE HELP WITH /OO/**~~


**Chaining**

  - Tell students that they will be working on chains of words with the
/oo/ sound.


  - Write the first word and tell students to look at the letters from left to right.
As they look at the letters, they need to remember the sounds the letters
stand for and blend the sounds together to make the word.


  - Make the letter change needed for the next word and describe the change
as it is made. For example, when changing _crook_ to _brook_ say, “Now I’m
changing the /c/ sound at the beginning of the word to the /b/ sound.
What word did I make now?”


  - Continue until the chain is complete.


  - If support is needed, model the sounds and blending. Also encourage
students to use the blending motions they have learned.


1. crook > brook > book > look > took > cook > hook > hood > wood


2. good > hood > hook > book > look > shook > nook > cook > took


**Code Knowledge**


Before today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
529 and 688 of those words would be completely decodable.


After today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
531 and 699 of those words would be completely decodable.


The sound /oo/ is the 39th most common sound in English and is found in
approximately 2 percent of English words.


The sound /oo/ is spelled ‘oo’ approximately 39 percent of the time.


The spelling alternative ‘u’ as in _put_ will be taught in Grade 2.

Lesson 6 Writing: Plan and Draft a Book Report
**71**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher
Today you will continue teaching students how to use the writing process.
Students will learn to use the story retelling narrative practiced last
week to write a book report on the story “The Two Dogs.” Like last week’s
writing lessons, the book report writing lessons are highly scaffolded, with
different steps conducted as whole class activities. This provides plentiful
opportunities for you to model and provide feedback about the writing
process, which is new to students. As time progresses and the writing
process becomes more familiar, students will be asked in the upcoming units
to write independently.


**Reading**

 - Load the story “The Hares and the Frogs” from the _Fables_ Reader from Teacher
Resources located in the program’s online materials or prepare to display the
_Fables_ Big Book.


 - Plan which students will read with partners and which students, needing
more guidance, will read with you in Group 1.







**Digital Component 6.1**




- Create the Preview Spellings Chart (Digital Component 6.1) for Introduce the
Story on the board/chart paper, or use the digital version.







**Digital Component 1.3**




 - Prepare to update the Fables Chart that you began in Lesson 1. In this lesson,
you will add details about the story “The Hares and the Frogs.”


**Writing**







**Digital Component 6.2**




- You will need the completed story map from Lesson 2 (Digital
Component 6.2) for the class rewriting of “The Two Dogs.” Students will need
Activity Page 6.2.


- You will need some way to display what you are writing today, such as the
board/chart paper, an overhead projector, or other means.







**Digital Component 2.1**



**72**




 - Prepare to display the writing process graphic you created in Lesson 2 or the

such as whether they thought it was a good story or an important lesson.


  - Remind students to refer to their Individual Code Charts and Tricky Word Wall

that their primary focus in writing this draft is to get their thoughts organized
into a paragraph.


  - Tell students that the first thing they need to write on the draft is the name of
the tale, or title. Tell students that a good title for a book report is the name
of the tale, “The Two Dogs,” and encourage them to write the title on Activity
Page 6.2 before moving to the next step.

- Remind students of the following things:


  - A sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a punctuation mark.


  - The first sentence of a paragraph is indented. You may wish to remind
students how to use their pointer fingers to help them indent.


  - Writing needs to have linking words, such as _once_, _next_, _then_, _last_, etc. Call
students’ attention to Activity Page 6.3, pointing out that the page already
includes some sentence starters in different places with linking words.


- Tell students that the first sentence of the book report should introduce the
name of the tale, the who (characters) and the where (setting). Tell students
to look at the sentence starter, “In the tale, ‘The Two Dogs,’” and ask for any
suggestions students may have as to how to extend this sentence to include
mention of the characters and setting. If students have difficulty, offer the
following example: “In the tale, ‘The Two Dogs,’ a tame dog and a free dog
meet at the tame dog’s home.”


- Tell students that they will next write about the what, or the plot of the tale.
Remind students that they will retell what happened in the story in order.
Encourage students to use the story map as well as the sentence starters to
help them get started. Ask students to share their thoughts aloud for each
sentence starter before starting to write. If needed, use this example: _Once,_
_the free dog asked the tame dog why the tame dog was so plump. Next, the_
_tame dog said, “I am plump because the men feed me and keep me on a rope.”_
_At the end, the free dog was glad to be free._


- Tell students that they will next write about what the tale tells us. For
example: _This tale tells us to like who we are._


- Tell students that the last line is where they can share their thoughts about
the story. Do they think this is a good story? Why or why not? For example _:_
_I liked this tale because it tells us to like who we are._ Or, _I did not like this tale_
_because one dog did not have a lot of food._


- When students have finished their drafts, call all students back together and
ask what step in the writing process comes after “draft”. _(edit)_


- Tell students that in the next lesson, they will edit what they have written.
To model how to edit a paper, you will select one student’s report to share
with the class. As a class, you will discuss what you like about the draft and
offer suggestions on how the author could make it even better. Tell students
to circle their name on Activity Page 6.3 if they are interested in having their
draft reviewed and edited by the class.

Lesson 7 Tricky Spelling and Writing: Introduce ‘oo’ ›/oo/ or /oo/ andEdit a Book Report
**83**


**84**



~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


Today you will teach students the tricky spelling ‘oo’. When a spelling is
designated as a tricky spelling, it means that the particular spelling can be
pronounced more than one way. The concept of tricky spellings is introduced
in a very gradual way. In Kindergarten, students were taught that the letter
‘s’ is a tricky spelling that can be pronounced as either /s/ or /z/ when
encountered in a word.


There are a number of tricky spellings in the English language. The most
challenging tricky spellings are those that represent different vowel sounds.
These often present a challenge when students are just learning to read.
Over the course of Grade 1, students will be taught several additional
tricky spellings.


Thus far in this unit, students have learned that the spelling ‘oo’ can be
pronounced as either /oo/ as in _soon_ or /oo/ in _look_ . However, up until this
point, individual activity pages and/or stories have included words with only
one of the spellings; students have not had to face the challenge of switching
back and forth between the appropriate pronunciations when reading words
with the ‘oo’ spelling. Beginning in today’s lesson, words with the ‘oo’ spelling
with both of the two possible pronunciations will be intermixed on activity
pages and stories. You will use a very specific procedure to teach the tricky
spellings of ‘oo’. This procedure will become a specific type of lesson that is
repeated in the remainder of Grade 1, in addition to the basic code and Tricky
Word lessons that you have already been teaching.


Please take the time prior to this lesson to become very comfortable with
hearing the difference between the two sounds—/oo/ and /oo/—as well as
the tricky spelling lesson procedure. Many adults, after years of experience
with print and rereading, do not consciously think about the difference
between the sounds /oo/ and /oo/. However, improper pronunciation on
your part may make decoding more difficult for students.


**Foundational Skills**

 - Write the words _should_, _would_, and _could_ on yellow index cards and be
prepared to add them to the Tricky Word Wall during the Tricky Word activity.


Foundational Skills 3


**Writing**

  - Select a student’s draft book report from among the students who
volunteered for the task yesterday. (Students volunteered their drafts by
circling their name on Activity Page 6.3.) Copy the student’s draft, including
any misspellings or other errors, onto the board/chart paper, skipping every
other line to leave room for editing. You may wish to number the sentences
using a different color. This will make it easier to refer to specific parts of
the story. The ideal draft for selection will be one that is good, but needing
improvement in one or more of the areas indicated on the editing checklist.


  - Be prepared to return all student drafts from Lesson 6, Activity Page 6.3,
to students if you collected them in the previous lesson.


  - Alert the student whose draft has been chosen at the start of the class.
Please note that in the future, students will complete their own editing
checklist. For now, however, they will continue to edit their writing as a
whole group activity.

**Note:** To illustrate the tricky spelling for today’s lesson and show the
possible pronunciations, you will make a diagram on the board/chart paper
as illustrated below. Do not draw the entire diagram ahead of time; follow the
step-by-step instructions that follow.









**86**




  - First, write the words _boo, moon,_ and _root_ on the left side of the board/chart
paper and read them aloud.


  - Point out that the spelling ‘oo’ is pronounced /oo/ in these words.


  - Write the words _book, hook,_ and _hood_ on the right side of the board/chart
paper and read them aloud.


  - Point out that, in these words, the spelling ‘oo’ is pronounced /oo/ rather
than /oo/.


  - Ask students how the spelling ‘oo’ could cause problems when they
are reading.


**TEKS 1.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (iii) decoding words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe

least 100 high-frequency words from a research-based list.


Foundational Skills 3


 - Explain that ‘oo’ is a “tricky spelling.” The spelling is tricky because it can be
pronounced more than one way. To figure out how to pronounce this tricky
spelling in a word, the students may need to try to pronounce it both ways.


 - To illustrate the problem, write the letters ‘oo’ on the board/chart paper
between the two sets of words and circle the spelling.


 - Draw one arrow from ‘oo’ to the /oo/ words and label it ‘1’. Explain that /oo/
is the most likely pronunciation and therefore the one they should try first.


 - Draw a second arrow from ‘oo’ to the /oo/ words and label it ‘2’. Explain
that /oo/ is a less likely option and that they should try this pronunciation
only if the first option does not sound right, and does not produce a word
they recognize.


 - Practice this procedure by writing the following words on the board _: bloom,_
_food, good, took, cook, cool._ Read the words first with the /oo/ pronunciation
and ask if that sounds right. If it does not, read it with the /oo/ pronunciation.


 - Leave the diagram on the board/chart paper so students can consult it as
they work on the next exercise.


 - Have students take out Activity Page 7.1.


 - Remind students that the bolded spellings are examples of the tricky spelling
‘oo’ and that the letters in slashes stand for sounds.


 - Ask students to read each word in the box and try pronouncing it first
with the sound /oo/. Let students decide if the word sounds correct
pronounced that way. If it does not, ask students to pronounce the word
with the /oo/ sound.


 - Have students copy the first two example words, _boo_ and _book_, into the
appropriate column. If students appear to understand the directions, have
them complete the remainder of the activity page independently.


~~**INTRODUCE TRICKY WORDS: COULD, SHOULD, WOULD (10 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** The Tricky Words in this lesson are deliberately introduced in a
different way than Tricky Words are usually taught. Instead of showing the
word and asking students how it might be pronounced (print to sound) the
usual approach, you will say the word and ask students how they would spell

(They likely will spell it _shood_, using the basic code spelling for /oo/ they
have learned.)


 - Write the actual spelling, _should_, on the board.


 - Circle ‘sh’ for the first sound, /sh/. Explain that it is spelled ‘sh’, as the
students would expect.


 - Underline ‘oul’ for the second sound, /oo/. Explain that this is the tricky part
of the word. They would probably expect the /oo/ sound to be spelled ‘oo’,
but here it is spelled ‘oul’.


 - Circle ‘d’ for the last sound, /d/. Explain that this is spelled with a ‘d’, just as
they would expect.


 - Have students write the word _should_ on their index cards, circling the ‘sh’,
underlining the ‘oul’, and circling the ‘d’.


**Tricky Words: Would and Could**

 - Repeat this procedure for the Tricky Words _would_ and _could_, explaining that
these words are tricky in exactly the same way as _should_ .


**Practice Tricky Words**

 - Have students place the index cards they made for today’s Tricky Words
lesson on their desks.

 - Explain that an editing checklist has steps to make drafts even better.
The steps are things the author should check in order to make their
writing better.


 - Read the first step of the checklist. Ask the class if the draft has the name of
the tale, or title. If not, you will show students how to add the name of the tale,
or title. If so, make a check mark next to that step on your editing checklist.


 - Work through the remaining steps and discuss whether each item can be
checked off; if not, talk about whether improvements could be made. Model
making any changes to the draft that the class agrees would be changes
for the better. For example, you can ask students if there are places where
details could be added, describing the characters, places, or things that
happened in the story. If students need prompting, call their attention to
one sentence at a time, reading the sentence aloud. Ask them to repeat the
sentence and add one specific detail.


 - Use the following editing conventions when correcting the draft. Explicitly
call students’ attention to these conventions, explaining that this is how
professional writers edit their work. Explain that they will use these same
corrections when they edit their own work.

**Teacher Resource: Editing Marks**


1. Cross out punctuation mistakes and write the correct punctuation mark above the
wrong one.


2. Cross out capitalization mistakes and write the correct uppercase/lowercase letter
above the wrong one.


3. Write a caret (^) where a word or punctuation mark needs to be inserted. Write the
word or punctuation mark above the caret.


4. Correct spelling mistakes if students notice or question them. You should accept
plausible spellings that use the sound/spelling correspondences taught thus far.


 - You can also ask students if they have any other suggestions that would
improve the student’s writing. Explain that they should make any suggestions
by asking a question.


 - Model this by saying, “Would it make the writing even better if we . . .?”
Using this phrasing will make it clear that students are making suggestions
for consideration, rather than mandating changes that must be made.


 - If changes are suggested, check with the class to see if everyone agrees.
Make the changes on the display book report. At this stage, two or three
suggestions are probably enough.


 - When you have completed the editing checklist with the class, be sure to
once again thank the author for having volunteered their draft.


**Students Edit Their Own Drafts**


**Note:** Students may wish to edit in a different-colored pencil.


 - Tell students that they will all now edit their own drafts. Hand back Activity
Page 6.3.


 - You will read the items on the editing checklist, and they will look at their own
papers to see if they need edits.


 - Ask the class if their own draft has the name of the tale, or title. If they do, tell
them to give you a thumbs-up sign. If they are missing the name of the tale,
tell them to write it down and give you the thumbs-up sign when they
are finished.


 - Work through the remaining editing checklist item by item and discuss
whether the item can be checked off; if not, talk about what types of
improvements could be made to make their writing better.


 - Circulate around the room at this time to check on students’ progress.

~~**MORE HELP WITH TRICKY SPELLING ‘OO’**~~


**Make Words**


**Note:** Students may make words including a final ‘s’ (e.g., _zooms_ or _books_ ).


  - Make one copy of **Activity Page TR 7.1** (/oo/ and /oo/) for each student.


  - First, have students complete the /oo/ portion of the activity page (front),
then have students complete the /oo/ (back) portion. If students only need
additional practice with one of the sound/spellings, then provide only the
related portion of the activity page.


Lesson 7 Tricky Spelling and Writing: Introduce ‘oo’ ›/oo/ or /oo/ andEdit a Book Report
**93**


**94**




 - Model how to use the letters to make words. Each word should include the
letters in the center box (‘oo’). Tracing the path between the letters may
support students as they attempt sound/spelling combinations. For example,
on the /oo/ page, trace ‘b’, ‘oo’, and ‘m’ to create _boom_ .


 - Have students record the words on the activity page. Some possible
words include:


(‘oo’ > /oo/) (front) boot, broom, loom, moon, noon, root, room, soon


(‘oo’ > /oo/) (back) shook, brook, cook, book, hook, hood, took, stood


 - Ensure comprehension by asking students to provide a sentence using the
real words they make.


 - More words can be created than the number of lines provided. For students
who are capable of productively continuing to create additional words, the
Extension Page ( **Activity Page TR 7.2** ) can be copied and provided.


~~**PROGRESS MONITORING (OPTIONAL)**~~


**Vowel Digraph Word Reading: ‘oo’ > /oo/ or /oo/**

 - Make a copy of the word cards for Progress Monitoring 1 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 7.3** ). Cut apart the word cards.


 - Make one copy of the Record Sheet for Progress Monitoring 1 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 7.4** ) for each student you are assessing.


 - Model with the sample item.


 - Show the cards to the student one at a time. Use the record sheet to record
each word as the student reads.


 - Place a check next to each word read correctly.


 - For misread words, write exactly what students say as the word is sounded
out. If students misread a word, prompt them to try to read the word again,
letting them know their first attempt was incorrect.


 - Students may benefit from the supports utilized during instruction such as
blending motions and representing sounds with objects (e.g., Push and Say).
Model and encourage their use with the sample item if needed. The goal is for
students to eventually be capable of completing the tasks without physical
supports or, at least, utilizing the supports independently (without
your prompt).


Foundational Skills 3


**Scoring:** Scoring is based on one point assigned for every vowel digraph in
a word that is read correctly. Interpret scores as follows:


    - 8 points—excellent


    - 6 or 7 points—good


    - 5 points—fair


    - Less than 5 points—poor


**Goal:** Achieve scores of good or excellent (6 points or higher).


Scores of 5 or less indicate additional reteaching and reinforcement
is required.


Further analyze student errors to determine whether there are one or more
particularly problematic sound/spellings. The subtotals for targeted sound/
spellings at the bottom of the record sheets facilitate the identification of
specific problem areas.


Also examine whether there are mispronunciations occurring more
frequently in a given position in words. For example, does the student read
the initial sound correctly, but misread the medial and/or final sound?


Finally, examine whether the student succeeded in reading words correctly
on the second attempt. If so, the student may be rushing and may benefit
from explicit instruction to slow down and look at each letter in a word
sequentially, left to right.


**Code Knowledge**


Before today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
531 and 699 of those words would be completely decodable.


After today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
537 and 704 of those words would be completely decodable.


_Would_ is one of the 50 most common words in most samples of written English.
In a typical passage of 1,000 words, _would_ occurs 3 to 4 times.


_Could_ is one of the 70 most common words in most samples of written English.
In a typical passage of 1,000 words, _could_ occurs 1 to 4 times.


_Should_ is one of the 200 most common words in most samples of written English.
In a typical passage of 1,000 words, _should_ occurs 0 to 2 times.

**Primary Focus:** Students will learn that a verb is a word that names an action and
will identify verbs in oral sentences. ~~**TEKS 1.3.D**~~


~~**IDENTIFY VERBS (10 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.3.D**~~


**Note:** In this grammar lesson you will write sentences on the board/chart
paper and mark the verbs.


  - Remind students that they have been learning about different parts of
speech this year. They have learned about nouns, both common and proper
nouns. Quickly review the definitions and several examples of common and
proper nouns.


  - Tell students they will learn about a new part of speech called verbs. Tell
students that a word that names an action is a part of speech called a verb.
Actions are things that you can do, like run and jump and read.


  - On the board/chart paper, write: _Jump up and down_ .


  - Have students read the sentence, name the action, and then perform
the action.


  - Say, “ _Jump_ is an action word. A word that names an action is a part of speech
called a verb.”


  - Underline _jump_ with a squiggly line and explain that you have underlined the
action word.


**Note:** The squiggly line is used to underline action words because it gives the
connotation of movement or action.


  - On the board/chart paper, write: _Hop on one leg_ .


  - Have students read the sentence, name the action, and then perform
the action.


  - Say, “ _Hop_ is an action word. A word that names an action is a part of speech
called a verb.”

**Noun or Verb Game**

 - Prepare a list of nouns and verbs. If students are still developing their
concept of a verb, start with present-tense verbs and include past-tense
verbs as students are ready.


 - Have students sit so it is easy for them to stand up or move (e.g., sitting in a
circle on the rug as compared to in chairs at a table).


 - Tell students you will say either a noun or a verb. If you say a noun, students
should sit still. However, verbs are action words, so if you say a verb, students
should show you the action.


 - If students are successful with identifying and discriminating nouns and
verbs, then the students could take turns providing a noun or verb for
the game.

Foundational Skills 3


  - Tell students that you will do one for practice together. Say the /ue/ sound,
telling all students to raise their hands when they find the speech bubble with
the /ue/ sound.


  - Now tell students to quickly scan all the spellings listed in the row next to the
speech bubble, looking for any that are outlined in green. Tell them this is a
quick way to find the spellings they have already learned. Tell all students to
raise their hands when they find a green spelling for this speech bubble.


  - Call on one student to give the spelling and read the example word as follows:
/ue/ is spelled ‘u_e’ and the example word is _cute_ .


  - Tell students that you are ready to start the game. You will call on the first
student to raise their hand after they have found the sound/spelling, and
example word.


  - Say to students, “I am thinking of the sound (insert sound from the box).
Ready? Go!” Review with the sound-spelling correspondences provided in
the box.


~~**INTRODUCE THE SOUND /OU/ (10 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** This is a listening exercise focusing on the /ou/ sound. The sound
is spelled ‘ou’ and ‘ow’ (not yet taught). Please do not ask students to read
the words.


  - Tell students that today they will learn a new sound—/ou/ as in _shout_ .


  - Have students say the /ou/ sound several times, stretching it out.


  - Ask students to repeat a number of words that have the /ou/ sound at the
beginning: _ouch, out, owl_ .


  - Ask students to repeat a number of words that have the /ou/ sound in the
middle: _shout, loud, round, couch, hound._


  - Ask students to repeat a number of words that have the /ou/ sound at the
end: _how, now, cow._


  - Ask students whether /ou/ is a vowel sound or a consonant sound. (It is a
vowel sound, made with an open mouth and an unobstructed airflow.)


**Sound Off**

  - Tell students that now you are going to read a story containing a number of
examples of the /ou/ sound.

**Foundational Literacy Skills**


Some of the words that
are used as examples
are multisyllabic words.
In Cantonese, Hmong,
Khmer, and Vietnamese
languages multisyllabic
words are rare or
nonexistent. Be sure to
differentiate each syllable
and emphasize the /ou/
sound. Help students
draw a connection to
other digraphs previous
learned and how two
letters work together to
make the same sound.

~~**ELPS 1.A**~~


Code Materials

  - Tell students to touch their noses whenever they hear the /ou/ sound. Tell
them to place their hand flat on their desk each time that they finish pointing
to their nose.


  - Read the story sentence by sentence, making an effort to emphasize the
/ou/ sound when you come across it.


  - Reread the first three sentences and ask students to count the /ou/ sounds
that they hear.


One night last summer, I sl **ou** ched (nose) on my c **ou** ch (nose) as I read a book ab **ou** t

(nose) fl **ow** ers (nose). At a late h **ou** r (nose), I heard a startling s **ou** nd (nose) **ou** tside

**Note:** Some students may realize that the words provided in the Sound
Off activity have a spelling other than ‘ou’. Should a student point this out,
congratulate them for already knowing another spelling for the /ou/ sound.
Tell them the class will learn these spellings at a later time.

**Vowel Code Flip Book**


1. ‘ou’ > /ou/ ( _shout_ ) **page 13**


  - Tell students that you are going to show them how to write the vowel
sound /ou/.


  - Write ‘ou’ on handwriting guidelines and describe what you are doing.


  - Explain that the two letters work together as a team to stand for the
/ou/ sound.


**Note:** The /ou/ vowel pronunciation in Spanish is very rare. Students may
need assistance with this digraph. Explain that to make the / ou/ sound, open
your mouth and speak from the back of your throat, then close your mouth
while continuing to speak from the back of the throat.


  - Have students trace the spelling on their desks with a pointed finger while
saying the sound.


**TEKS 1.2.B.iii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe
syllables; vowel teams, including vowel digraphs and diphthongs; and r-controlled syllables.


Foundational Skills 3


 - Turn to **Vowel Code Flip Book page 13** . Show students the Spelling Card
for ‘ou’ > /ou/ ( _shout_ ). Discuss the power bar and have a student read the
example word. Attach the Spelling Card to the appropriate space.


 - Have students turn to **Individual Code Chart page 4** . Have them trace the
code information for ‘ou’ > /ou/ in green marker.


 - Tell students that whenever the spelling ‘ou’ appears on an activity page or
in a story for the next few lessons, it will be printed in darker, bolder ink to
remind them that the two letters stand for a single sound.


Check for Understanding


Walk around as students trace the ‘ou’ on their desks and listen to make sure that

students are making the correct sound.

  - To summarize, write the spelling ‘ou’ on the third line of the vowel digraph
chart you created in Lesson 1. Review that the spelling ‘ou’ can stand for the
/ou/ sound. Ask students for several examples of words in which ‘ou’ stands
for /ou/ and add the words to the chart.


  - Remember: You can refer to the digraph ‘ou’ by its sound or by the letter
names. Continue to encourage students to say the sounds of the individual
spellings as they write the words.

 - Ask, “What does the mule do to try to be like the dog?” _(He comes in the_
_house, puts his feet on the man, and licks him.)_


 - Ask, “Why do you think the man was scared by the mule?” _(The man may_
_have thought that the mule was going to hurt him; the man’s plate dropped_
_and the man fell down.)_


 - Ask, “What do you think the mule should do now?” _(Accept reasonable_
_responses, such as: The mule should stay outside from now on.)_


 - Ask, “What is the moral of the story?” _(Explain that the moral is that it’s better_
_to be yourself than to act like someone else.)_

circle on the rug as opposed to in chairs at a table).


 - Tell students you will either say a noun or a verb. If you say a noun, students
should sit still. However, verbs are action words, so if you say a verb, students
should show you the action.


 - Once students are successful with identifying and discriminating nouns
and verbs, have them take turns providing a noun or verb for the game.

  - Remind students that if we read a word that has the letter ‘o’, one ‘o’ is usually
pronounced /o/, and two side by side are usually pronounced /oo/ or /oo/.


  - Write _poof_ on the board.


  - Ask a student to read the word, first in a segmented fashion and
then blended.


  - Replace ‘f’ with ‘l’ to create _pool_ .


  - As you make this change, say, “If that is _poof_, what is this?”


  - Ask students which sound you changed in the word _poof_ to get the word _pool_ .
Ask them whether you changed the first, middle, or last sound.

Call on individual students to tell you which sound was changed in each word, and

call on individual students to segment and blend each word.


Support



~~**ALPHABETIZE TO THE SECOND LETTER (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Use the following strategies and routines to teach and reinforce how to
alphabetize a series of words to the second letter. Remind students that to
alphabetize means to use the order of letters of the alphabet to organize
words.


 - Write these words in a line on the board: _dog, cat, bird, ant, dull._ Say, “Let’s
look at and say some words we have been learning and then list them in
alphabetical order. Remember we start by looking at the first letter. The letter
_a_ comes before the letters _b, c,_ and _d_ in the alphabet, so I will write _ant_ first
in our list. The letter _b_ comes after _a_ and before _c_ and _d,_ so the next word in
our list is _bird.”_ Ask students which word should come next in your list. _(cat)_
Say, “Yes. The letter _c_ comes after _a_ and _b_ in the alphabet, and I will write _cat_
under _bird.”_



Work with a small group
of students to read
and complete Activity
Pages 11.1 or 11.2. Use the
pictures you brought
in as needed.

on the back of Activity
Page 11.1. If time permits,
allow them to share the
questions with the class.


Activity Pages
11.1, 11.2


**134**




 - Then ask students what letter the remaining two words begin with. _(d)_ Point
out that to figure out the correct order of these words, you will have to look
at the second letter of each word. Ask students which letter comes first: _u_ or
_o. (o)_ Say, “Because _o_ comes before _u,_ we know that _dog_ comes before _dull.”_
Write _dog_ and _dull_ in order.


 - Use the index cards prepared in advance with the words: _back, apple, cot,_
_less, tale, rock, store, tell, small._ Distribute them to ten students who then
stand randomly at the front of the class. Have another volunteer name which
word comes first in alphabetical order. The student with that word should
move to the left to start a line of words in alphabetical order. Continue having
students name words until all of the cards are in order.


~~**YES OR NO?/FILL IN THE BLANK (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Activity Pages 11.1 and 11.2 review previously taught sound/spelling
correspondences. You may choose to complete these activity pages as a
whole class or small group activity, or by having students work with a partner
or independently.

~~**TRICKY WORD BASEBALL (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Divide the class into two teams, having one team at a time line up in front of
the baseball diamond drawing you prepared in advance. (You may choose to
have students stay seated and divide the class into teams by the manner in
which they are seated.) Each team takes a “turn at bat.”


) **Digital Component 11.1**


  - Set a timer for 10 minutes and tell students that whichever team has the
most runs when the timer rings is the winning team. Point out that accuracy
is important, so they have to be careful reading the words. At the same time,
speed is important as well, so they must pay close attention. The more
turns each team member has to read words, the more likely their team is to
score runs.


  - Show a Tricky Word card and ask the first person on the team to read it
aloud. If the word is read correctly, draw a line from home plate to first base,
signifying a “hit.” This player then goes to the back of the team’s line, while
the next player comes forward to read the next card. If the word is correctly
read, draw a line from first to second base. Play continues this way. If the
fourth player reads the word correctly, draw a line from third base to home
plate and mark “1 run” for the team. Play continues for the team as long
as no words are misread; when a word is misread, the next team takes its
turn at bat.


Check for Understanding


Make note of any Tricky Words that are misread and by which student(s).

stand for and blend the sounds together to make the word.


  - Make the letter change needed for the next word and describe the change
as it is made. For example, when changing crook to brook say, “Now I’m
changing the /c/ sound at the beginning of the word to the /b/ sound. What
word did I make now?”


  - Continue until the chain is complete.


  - If support is needed, model the sounds and blending. Also encourage

  - Say, “Today, I bake a cake,” emphasizing the words _today_ and _bake_ .


  - Have students identify the verb/action in the sentence. The verb _bake_ is in
the present tense, which means the action is happening now. Point out that
the word _today_ helps us know that the action is happening now and is the
present tense.


  - Say, “Yesterday, I baked a cake,” emphasizing the words _yesterday_ and _baked_,
being sure to clearly pronounce the ending /t/ sound.


  - Have students identify the verb/action in this sentence. Explain that _baked_
is a verb/action word like _bake_ . The verb _baked_ is in the past tense, which
means that the action has already happened. Point out that the word
_yesterday_ helps us know that the action already happened and is in the past.


  - Repeat the words _bake_ and _baked_, making sure students hear the difference.
Point out that just the one extra sound at the end of _baked_, /t/, lets us knows
that the action already happened and the verb is in the past tense.


  - Ask students to listen to the following sentences and identify the
verb (action) in each: “Today, I clap my hands” and “Yesterday, I clapped
my hands.”

past. _(There is an extra /t/ at the end of the verb and the word_ yesterday
_is in the sentence.)_


 - Repeat with the following sentences.


1. Today, I hop on one foot.


2. Yesterday, I hopped on one foot.


3. I miss my friend Jamal today.


4. I missed my friend Jamal yesterday.


 - Ask students to listen to the following sentences and identify the verb
(action) in each: “I play ball today” and “Yesterday, I played ball.”


 - Ask students which verb they think is in the past tense, _play_ or _played_ ?
Reread the sentences. Point out that the extra sound at the end of _played_ is
/d/. Tell students that some verbs in the past tense have a /t/ at the end and
some have a /d/.


 - Repeat with the following sentences:


1. Today, I listen to music.


2. I listened to music yesterday.


3. Today, I clean my room.


4. Yesterday, I cleaned my room.


Check for Understanding


Say the following sentence: “Today I walk to the park.” Ask students to identify the

verb. _(walk)_ Ask students if _walk_ is a present- or past-tense verb. Have students use

**Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down** —thumbs-up if _walk_ means happening in the present

or thumbs-down if _walk_ means happening in the past. Discuss the correct answer.

_(thumbs-up;_ walk _is present-tense;_ walked _is the past-tense)_ Ask different students

Support


If students need additional
support distinguishing
the sounds /o/ and /aw/,
encourage them to look in
a mirror while saying the
sounds. Talk about what
they see.


/o/: Mouth is open wide
and jaw is low (Remind
students to use the
gesture for the /o/ sound:
circle open mouth with
finger.)


/aw/: Mouth is open
wide and jaw is low at
first (as for /o/) but
shifts incompletely to the
articulation for /w/ with
lips pursed.


**174**




 - Ask students to repeat a number of words that have the /aw/ sound at the
end: _draw, straw, law, jaw_ .


 - Ask students whether /aw/ is a vowel sound or a consonant sound. (It is a
vowel sound, made with an open mouth and an unobstructed airflow.)


**Minimal Pairs**

 - Explain that sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference between the /aw/
sound as in _paw_ and the /o/ sound as in _pop_ .


 - Ask students to say /aw/ several times.


 - Demonstrate the /o/ sound for students, then ask students to say /o/
several times.


 - Tell students to open their mouths wide like when they go to the dentist or
when a doctor looks inside their mouth at their throat/tonsils. The /o/ sound
is made with a mouth open but not as wide as the /aw/ sound.


 - Repeat this exercise with the words _Don_ and _dawn_ .


 - Tell students that you are going to say word pairs. The words will be very
similar, but one word will contain the /aw/ sound and the other word will
contain the /o/ sound.


 - Have students close their eyes and listen as you say the first word pair.

sound /aw/.


 - Write ‘aw’ on handwriting guidelines and describe what you are doing.


 - Explain that the two letters work together as a team to stand for
the /aw/ sound.


**Note:** There is not an /aw/ vowel pronunciation in Spanish. Students may
need assistance with this sound. Explain that to make the /aw/ sound, open
your mouth wide and make the sound by vibrating the back of your throat.
Notice that your mouth is open wider than it is when you make the
/oe/ sound.


 - Model writing the spelling two or three more times.


 - Have students trace the spelling on their desks with a pointed finger while
saying the sound.


Check for Understanding


Walk around as students trace ‘aw’ on their desks and listen to make sure students

are making the correct sound.

Lesson 16 Review: Nouns and Verbs
**181**


**Start Lesson**


**Lesson 16: Review**
25M
Language


**Primary Focus**
Students will identify common and proper nouns in oral phrases. ~~**TEKS 1.11.D.iii**~~


Students will identify regular present- and past-tense verbs in oral sentences.

~~**TEKS 1.11.D.ii**~~


~~**REVIEW COMMON AND PROPER NOUNS (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that while they have been practicing how to identify verbs/
action words as a part of speech in this unit, they practiced the identification
of another part of speech, nouns, in the previous unit.


  - Ask, “What is a noun?” Review that a noun is a word that names a person,
place, or thing.


  - Say, “climbs up the mountain” and ask students to identify the noun in
the phrase.


  - Once students have identified _mountain_ as a noun, ask students how they
know it is a noun. Is it a person, place, or thing?


  - Repeat, “climbs up the mountain” and ask students if there is a verb in this
phrase and, if so, to identify it. If necessary, remind them that a verb is an
action word.


  - Continue in the same manner with the phrases and sentences in the box.









**182**




  - Now remind students that there are two kinds of nouns, common and proper
nouns. The nouns that they have just identified were common nouns. Remind
students that proper nouns name a specific person, place, or thing.


  - Tell students that you are going to say some more phrases. This time you will
ask them to also tell you whether any nouns are common or proper nouns.


**TEKS 1.11.D** Edit drafts using standard English conventions including (iii) singular, plural, common, and proper nouns; (ii) past
and present verb tense.


Foundational Skills 3


- Say, “walks to (name of your school)” and ask students to identify the noun
and tell whether it is a common or proper noun. _(proper noun)_


- Continue in the same manner with the phrases and sentences below.









Check for Understanding


Say, “(name of a teacher at school) eats lunch.” Ask students for the noun in the

sentence. Tell students that you think it is a common noun. Then, have students

use **Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down** to show if they agree or disagree. _(thumbs-down)_

Discuss the correct answer. If time permits, continue with one more example. Say,

“a little cat.” Ask students for the noun. Tell students that you think it is a common

noun. Then have students use Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down to show if they agree or

disagree. _(thumbs-up)_ Discuss the correct answer.


~~**IDENTIFY PRESENT- AND PAST-TENSE VERBS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students to tell you what a verb is. _(an action word)_ Remind them that
several lessons ago you talked about two kinds of verbs—present-tense verbs
show that an action is happening right now, in the present; and past-tense
verbs show that the action already happened, in the past.


  - Say, “Today, I jump up and down” and “Yesterday, I jumped up and down.”
Ask students to tell you which sentence has a verb in the past tense that
shows an action that has already happened.


  - Once students have identified _jumped_ as the past-tense verb, ask them to
explain how they know it is past tense. If necessary, prompt students to
mention that there are two clues—one clue is the use of the word _yesterday_
which signals something already happened; the other clue is the extra / _t_ /
sound at the end of the verb _jump_ . Remind them that they learned that if the
verb has an extra /t/ at the end of the verb, it likely is past tense and shows
an action that has already happened.


Lesson 16 Review: Nouns and Verbs
**183**


Challenge


Ask individual students or
pairs of students to say
additional sentences for
the class. The class will
identify the verb and tell
whether it is present- or
past-tense.


**184**




- Now say, “Last night, I painted a picture.” and “Today I paint the fence with my
brother.” Again, ask students to tell you which phrase has a verb in the past
tense that shows an action that has already happened. Again, ask students
to explain how they know _painted_ is past tense, meaning it already happened.
Be sure to point out that there are again two clues— _last night_ and the extra
/ed/ sound at the end of the verb _paint_ . Remind them that they also learned
that if the verb as an extra _/ed/_ at the end of the verb, it likely is past tense
and shows an action that has already happened.


- Say each of the sentences in the box. Ask students to identify the verb and
whether it is present tense, showing an action happening now, or past tense,
showing an action that already happened.





**Lesson 16: Review**

Foundational Skills



**Primary Focus:** Students will read previously taught Tricky Words.


~~**TRICKY WORD BASEBALL (15 MIN.)**~~



~~**TEKS 1.2.B.vi**~~



)



**Digital Component 11.1**




  - Divide the class into two teams, having one team at a time come to line up
in front of the baseball diamond drawing you prepared in advance. (You may
choose to have students stay seated and divide the class into teams by the
manner in which they are seated.) Each team takes a “turn at bat.”


**TEKS 1.2.B.vi** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by identifying and reading at least 100 high-frequency words from
a research-based list.


Foundational Skills 3


 - Set a timer for 10 minutes and tell students that whichever team has the
most runs when the timer rings is the winning team. Point out that accuracy
is important, so they have to be careful reading the words. At the same time,
speed is important as well, so they must pay close attention. The more
turns each team member has to read words, the more likely their team is to
score runs.


 - Show a Tricky Word card and ask the first person on the team to read it
aloud. If the word is read correctly, draw a line from home plate to first base,
signifying a “hit.” This player then goes to the back of the team’s line, while the
next player comes forward to read the next card. If the word is correctly read,
draw a line from first to second base. Play continues this way. If the fourth
player reads the word correctly, draw a line from third base to home plate and
mark “1 run” for the team. Play continues for the team so long as no words are
misread; when a word is misread, the next team takes its turn at bat.


Check for Understanding


Make note of any Tricky Words that are misread and by which student(s).



**Lesson 16: “The Dog and the Ox”**
Reading



20M



**Primary Focus:** Students will read the “The Dog and the Ox” with purpose and
understanding and will answer literal, inferential, and evaluative questions about
key details in the text. ~~**TEKS 1.4; TEKS 1.6.G**~~


~~**INTRODUCE THE STORY (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students to turn to the table of contents. Tell them to locate the story
that comes after “The Bag of Coins.” Ask students to tell you the title of the
next story _(“The Dog and the Ox”)_ and the starting page number _(48)_ .


  - Tell students that today’s story features a type of animal called an ox. Tell
students to turn to page 51 and point out the illustration of the ox. Explain
that an ox is an animal that looks similar to a cow and is often found on farms.
An ox may be used to do hard work, like pulling or carrying heavy things.


**TEKS 1.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text; **TEKS 1.6.G** Evaluate details to
determine what is most important with adult assistance.

**Preview Core Vocabulary**

 - Please preview the following vocabulary before reading today’s story:


**straw—n.,** dried wheat or oat stems that are used for bedding for farm
animals (48)

Example: The pigs were asleep on the straw on the barn floor.


**Note:** Hay is dried grass that some farm animals eat. Although straw may
look similar to hay, straw is used for bedding and hay is used as feed. In this
story, the dog mistakes the hay in a food box for straw.


**loft—n.,** an open space or storage area at the top of a barn; straw is often
stored in a loft (50)

Example: We climbed a ladder up to the loft in the barn.

**Wrap-Up**

 - When students have finished reading today’s story, use the discussion
questions to ensure that they understood the story. Alternatively, you may
stop and discuss the appropriate questions at the end of each page.


 - Use student responses to update the Fables Chart. The moral of this fable
may be difficult for students to grasp. Guide them in understanding that the
dog didn’t want to get up and let the ox eat because the dog thought the box
was filled with straw for a nap. Explain that the lesson is that he should have
listened when the ox suggested he sleep in the loft; he could have still had his
nap and would not have been scolded by the man.

concept of a verb, start with present-tense verbs and include past-tense
verbs as students are ready.


 - Have students sit so it is easy for them to stand up or move (e.g., sitting in a
circle on the rug as compared to in chairs at a table).


 - Tell students you will say either a noun or a verb. If you say a noun, students
should sit still. However, verbs are action words, so if you say a verb, students
should show you the action.


 - If students are successful with identifying and discriminating nouns and
verbs, then they could take turns providing a noun or verb for the game.

~~**READ “THE FOX AND THE GRAPES” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Small Group**


**Group 1:** Have these students take turns reading the story aloud with you.


**Group 2:** Tell the students in this group that today they will read the story
“The Fox and the Grapes” with a partner. They may reread other stories if
time permits.


Observation: Anecdotal Reading Record


Use the Anecdotal Reading Record to record student progress as you listen to

them read “The Fox and the Grapes.”


**Wrap-Up**

 - Use the following discussion questions to further guide your conversation
about the story. Remember to encourage students to answer in complete
sentences. When answering each question, ask students to cite the part of
the story that guided their answer.


 - Use students’ responses to complete the Fables Chart. Students may have
difficulty figuring out the moral or lesson of this fable on their own. Guide
students in understanding that sometimes when you are disappointed
because you can’t have something that you really want, it may be easier to
accept the disappointment by trying to convince yourself or pretend that
what you originally wanted was not really as wonderful as you thought.

Note to Teacher


Today you will administer the Unit 3 Assessment. The first assessment is a
word recognition exercise that targets the sound/spelling correspondences
taught in Unit 3. The second part assesses students’ ability to read a
story independently and answer comprehension questions. Please note
that if students appear too tired or unable to concentrate after the first
assessment, you may choose to do Pausing Point activities the remainder
of the lesson, and complete the story reading assessment the next day.


Refer to the Record Sheet for the Unit 3 Assessment and the analysis
directions for Word Recognition and Story Comprehension Assessments,
found in Teacher Resources. If a student makes more than one error for any
single sound/spelling on the Word Recognition assessment, their mastery of
this spelling should be called into question.


 - Gather Wiggle Cards from previous lessons to use in today’s break. If you
need additional Wiggle Cards, you may create new cards with the
following phrases.



1. Count to five.


2. Look at a pal.


3. Point to me.



4. Smell the fresh blooms.


5. Make a “hoot hoot” sound.


6. Jump from foot to foot.

- If, however, a student does well on the Word Recognition Assessment, but
poorly on the Story Comprehension Assessment, they may need more
opportunities to build fluency and automaticity by rereading stories, as
well as summarizing the stories as they read. Consider having this student

~~**TRICKY WORD FAMILY LETTER**~~


Dear Family Member,


In this unit, your student will continue to learn new Tricky Words. Tricky Words are words that do
not follow the rules for encoding that your student has learned, so they simply must learn and
remember how to read and spell them. The tricky parts of each word are underlined. Your student
will be taught to read the following new words as Tricky Words: _because_ (Lesson 2), _could_, _would_,
_should_ (Lesson 7), and _down_ (Lesson 10). You are being provided with flash cards that include
the new words learned in this unit. Your student should already be able to read all of the other
Tricky Words on the flash cards successfully at the beginning of this unit, as they were taught
in earlier units.


Please have your student cut out the flash cards. In order to build increasingly rapid, automatic
recognition of these words, show the cards to your student in random order and have your student
read them to you as quickly as possible several times each week.

~~**TRICKY WORD ASSESSMENT RECORD: BEGINNING AND END OF UNIT 3 (OPTIONAL)**~~


This is an optional assessment of previously taught Tricky Words. At the beginning and end of Unit 3,
show the student the Tricky Word list that follows this record.


Ask the student to read each word on the page from left to right, top to bottom. Provide students
with either a blank sheet of paper or card stock to place on the word list page directly under the row
to be read. As students complete a row, they can slide the paper down just enough to read the
next row.


Record each student’s performance in the following chart, using + to indicate that the word was
read correctly and – to indicate the word was read incorrectly; if the student misreads a completely
different word, record the word read by the student. Mark as incorrect any word that the student
does not read within 3–5 seconds.

~~**LESSON 5: SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


**Directions**


Write students’ names in the column provided. The words on today’s spelling assessment are
grouped on the analysis chart according to spelling patterns. Place an X in the column of any
word that the student did not spell correctly. Examine errors for patterns using the information
provided. If a pattern is identified, speak with the student and ask them to explain their thinking
to you. This may help you understand the each student’s confusion and allow you to clear up
the misunderstanding. You may also use previous Pausing Points to address errors with today’s
spelling words.


**Column 1**


What an error in this column means: The spelling ‘ee’ for the /ee/ sound is a vowel digraph, where
two letters work together to stand for a single sound. This is a concept that some students may
find difficult.


What you should do: You may wish to do Minimal Pairs activities to help students distinguish
between the /e/ sound as in _met_ and the /ee/ sound as in _meet_ .


**Column 2**


What an error in this column means: Tricky Words are words that do not follow the rules for
encoding that students have learned thus far. For now, students should memorize how to spell
Tricky Words.


What you should do: Tricky Word _they_ can be analyzed in two parts: the /th/ sound spelled ‘th’ and
the /ae/ sound spelled ‘ey’. Determine which sound the student had difficulty encoding in order
to provide accurate remediation. Students demonstrating difficulty with the ‘th’ spelling for the
/ th/ sound may struggle with the concept of two letters working together to stand for one sound.
Students demonstrating difficulty with the ‘ey’ spelling for the /ae/ sound should remember that
this is the tricky part of the word and must be memorized.


**Columns 3, 4, and 5**


What an error in these columns means: The spellings ‘a_e’ for the /ae/ sound, ‘i_e’ for the /ie/
sound, and ‘o_e’ for the /oe/ sound are separated digraphs, a concept that some students may find
difficult. Separated digraphs are two letters that work together to stand for a single sound, but are
separated by a consonant sound.


What you should do: Please refer to the Unit 2 introduction for explicit explanations of how best to
highlight separated digraphs for students.


Foundational Skills 3
**258**


**Column 6**


In the last column, specifically note any other confusion evidenced by individual student errors.
For example, students may have had difficulty encoding the consonant clusters in _stone_ and _green_ .
Please also consider the influence of students’ home language on encoding. For example, students
who spell the /ee/ sound with the ‘i’ spelling may be using the Spanish system of sound/spelling
correspondences. You should acknowledge this as one of the spellings for the /ee/ sound that
students will learn in later grades and guide students to use the ‘ee’ spelling for now. Students who
speak Spanish as their home language may also spell the /th/ sound with the ‘d’ spelling, as the
Spanish ‘d’ spelling is articulated in a similar location. Analyze any patterns and provide targeted
remediation using previous Pausing Points.

that the student did not spell correctly. Examine errors for patterns using the information provided.
If a pattern is identified, speak with the student and ask them to explain their thinking to you. This
may help you understand the student’s confusion and allow you to clear up the misunderstanding.
You may also use previous Pausing Points to address errors with today’s spelling words.


**Column 1**


What an error in this column means: Tricky Words are words that do not follow the rules for
encoding that students have learned thus far. For now, students should memorize how to spell
Tricky Words.


What you should do: Tricky Word _why_ can be analyzed in two parts, both of which are tricky at this
point in Grade 1: the /w/ sound spelled ‘wh’ and the /ie/ sound spelled ‘y’.


**Column 2**


What an error in this column means: The spelling ‘oo’ for the /oo/ sound is a vowel digraph, where
two letters work together to stand for a single sound. This is a concept that some students may
find difficult.


What you should do: You may wish to start with the Tricky Spelling discussion in Lesson 7. You may
also wish to do Minimal Pairs activities to help students distinguish between this and other
similar sounds.


**Column 3**


What an error in this column means: The spelling ‘o’ for the /o/ sound is the Basic Code spelling.


What you should do: You may wish to do Minimal Pairs activities to help students distinguish
between this and other similar sounds.


**Column 4**


What an error in this column means: The spelling ‘o_e’ for the /oe/ sound is a separated digraph,
a concept that some students may find difficult. Separated digraphs are two letters that work
together to stand for a single sound, but are separated by a consonant sound.


What you should do: Please refer to the Unit 2 introduction for explicit explanations of how best to

Please also consider the influence of students’ home language on encoding. For example, students
who spell the /oo/ sound with the ‘u’ spelling may be using the Spanish system of sound/spelling
correspondences. You should acknowledge this as one of the spellings for the /oo/ sound that
students will learn in later grades and guide students to use the ‘oo’ spelling for now. Analyze any
patterns and provide targeted remediation using previous Pausing Points.


This spelling assessment asks students to write a sentence. Make sure students capitalize the first
letter of the first word in the sentence and add appropriate punctuation to the end of the sentence.

between this and other similar sounds. Please refer to the Pausing Point for additional activities.


**Column 2**


What an error in this column means: The spelling ‘oo’ for the /oo/ sound is a vowel digraph, where
two letters work together to stand for a single sound. This concept can be difficult for
some students.


What you should do: You may wish to review with the Tricky Spelling discussion in Lesson 7. You may
also wish to do Minimal Pairs activities to help students distinguish between this and other similar
sounds. Please refer to the Pausing Point for additional activities.


**Column 3**


What an error in this column means: The spelling ‘oo’ for the /oo/ sound is a vowel digraph, where
two letters work together to stand for a single sound. This concept can be difficult for
some students.


What you should do: You may wish to review with the Tricky Spelling discussion in Lesson 7. You may

**Column 4**


What an error in this column means: The spelling ‘ou’ for the /ou/ sound is a vowel digraph, where
two letters work together to stand for a single sound. This concept can be difficult for
some students.


What you should do: You may wish to do Minimal Pairs activities to help students distinguish
between this and other similar sounds. Please refer to the Pausing Point for additional activities.


**Column 5**


In this column, specifically note any other confusion evidenced by individual student errors. For
example, students may have had difficulty with consonant clusters or consonant digraphs. Please
also consider the influence of students’ home language on encoding. For example, students who
identified the /oo/ sound with the ‘u’ spelling may be using the Spanish system of sound/spelling
correspondences. You should acknowledge this as one of the spellings for the /oo/ sound that
students will learn in later grades and guide students to use the ‘oo’ spelling for now. Analyze any
patterns and provide targeted remediation using previous Pausing Points _._


~~**ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS FOR STORY COMPREHENSION ASSESSMENT—UNIT 3**~~


The questions on the Story Comprehension Assessment are grouped on the analysis chart
according to whether the question is literal or evaluative. Place an X in the column of any question
that the student did not correctly identify. For the Literal column, please mark the number of
the question answered incorrectly. Examine errors for patterns using the information provided
below. If a pattern is identified, speak with the student and ask them to explain their thinking
to you. This may help you to understand the student’s confusion and allow you to clear up the
misunderstanding. You may also use previous Pausing Points to address errors.


**Literal**


What an error in this column means: Literal questions assess students’ recall of key details from the
story. These questions are text dependent, requiring students to paraphrase and/or refer back to
the portion of the story in which the specific answer to the question is provided.


What you should do: Remind students that they should always go back to the text to find an answer.
Most questions ask them to retell details from the text, and students should always find the answer
in the text and never skip this important step. Have students retell the plot of the story to you
in order.


Teacher Resources
**269**


**Evaluative**


What an error in this column means: Evaluative questions ask students to build upon what they
have learned from the text using analytical and application skills. These questions are also text
dependent, but require students to paraphrase and/or refer back to the portion(s) of the story that
substantiate the argument they are making or the opinion they are offering.


What you should do: Evaluative questions ask students to take what they have read and make a
judgment or come to a conclusion about it. This evaluative question asks students to determine the
lesson we learn from this fable. In prompting students to answer this question correctly, first make
sure students understand the story at a literal level. Then, discuss with students what it means to
play a trick on someone. What lesson could we use in our own lives from this story? That is what the
tale tells us.

|(5) Cross-curricular second language acquisition/writing. The ELL writes in a variety of forms with increasing accuracy to<br>effectively address a specific purpose and audience in all content areas. ELLs may be at the beginning, intermediate, advanced,<br>or advanced high stage of English language acquisition in writing. In order for the ELL to meet grade-level learning expectations<br>across foundation and enrichment curriculum, all instruction delivered in English must be linguistically accommodated<br>(communicated, sequenced, and scaffolded) commensurate with the student’s level of English language proficiency. For<br>Kindergarten and Grade 1, certain of these student expectations do not apply until the student has reached the stage of<br>generating original written text using a standard writing system.|(5) Cross-curricular second language acquisition/writing.
