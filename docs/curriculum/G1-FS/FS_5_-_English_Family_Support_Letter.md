# **Welcome!**
## Grade 1, Unit 5 Foundational Skills

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will be introduced to spelling alternatives to the sounds in words and to forming plural

endings, and they will continue to review nouns, verbs, and adjectives.


**What** **will** **my** **student** **learn?**


Students will learn the following new spelling alternatives: /ch/ spelled ‘tch’; /j/ spelled ‘g’ and ‘ge’, /v/ spelled ‘ve’, and

/r/ spelled ‘wr’. Students will practice hearing and saying the sounds, then begin practicing spelling by completing

word sorts and copying words. Students will also practice reading and answering questions with the Reader, _Kate’s_

_Book._ Students will work on grammar by learning about plural endings. They will practice adding the endings - _s_, - _es_,

- _ing_, and - _ed_ by learning about the root words and spelling changes. In writing, students will write their personal

opinions about the Reader and their favorite parts of the book. Students will be able to plan, draft, and edit pieces

of writing with support from the teacher.
