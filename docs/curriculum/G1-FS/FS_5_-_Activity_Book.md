**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the
Teacher Guide for Unit 5. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the
lesson number and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are
two activity pages for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. The activity
pages in this book do not include written instructions for students because the instructions
would have words that are not decodable. Teachers will explain these activity pages to the
students orally, using the instructions in the Teacher Guide. The Activity Book is a student
component, which means each student should have an Activity Book.

Dear Family Member,

Today our class started Unit 5. The Reader for this unit is called _Kate’s Book_ . Your
student will bring home stories you can read together about a young Navajo girl named
Kate who spends a summer out west with her Doba, or grandmother. Remember that
reading at home with your student is important for their success as a reader.

In addition, your student’s spelling words for this week include a review of previously
taught sound/spellings. As usual, there is one Tricky Word. Tricky Words do not play by
the rules, meaning there are spellings that do not sound the way students would expect
them to. These words need to be memorized, so your student will benefit from practice
reading and writing them.

**The Coin Shop**

Do·ba drove us to the coin shop.


The man in the coin shop was a
pal of hers. His name was Sa·ni.

“Sa·ni,” Do·ba said, “this is Kate Nez.

summ·er. We went for a hike, and Kate
found a coin in a cave.”

“Well, Miss Nez,” Sa·ni said, “let’s
have a look at it!”

I hand·ed him the coin.

Sa·ni set it un·der a look·ing glass
and swi **tch** ed on a lamp. “Let’s see,”
he said. “It’s got some scra **tch** ·es on
it. But I can tell that it’s a Span·ish
coin. It’s made of sil·ver, too.”

“There’s no date on the coin,” said Sa·ni. “But I’ll bet
it dates back to the six·teen hun·dreds. The Span·ish
mint·ed a big ba **tch** of coins like this one back then.”

“Good·ness!” said Do·ba.


“Is that a long time back in the past?” I asked.

“Yes,” said Sa·ni. “Let me run and fe **tch** my book on
Span·ish coins.”

When Sa·ni came back, he said, “There’s just one
thing I need you to tell me, Miss Nez.”


“What’s that?” I asked.


“Are there a lot of coins like this one in that cave?”


“No,” I said, “we found just this one.”

“That’s a shame,” Sa·ni said.


“Why?” I asked.

“If there were a lot of coins, you and your Do·ba
would be rich!” said Sa·ni. “I could sell a coin like this
for three hun·dred bucks!”

“Three hun·dred bucks?” said Do·ba.

Sa·ni nodd·ed.

“Yipp·ee!” I shout·ed. “I’m rich!”

Your student has been learning how to form plural nouns. In class, we have been
listening to the sound that ‘s’ makes at the end of a word. For _books_, for example, the ‘s’
makes a /s/ sound, whereas the word _dogs_ has the buzzy /z/ sound. Below are a number
of words your student should change to the plural form. Ask your student to listen for
either the /s/ or /z/ sound at the end. Have students place their fingers on their voice
boxes so they can feel the difference between /s/ and /z/. Remind your student that
when a word ends in ‘sh’, ‘ch’, ‘s’, and ‘x’, we add ‘es’ to change it to the plural form.

Encourage your student to read the story to you and then talk about it together. The tricky
parts in Tricky Words are underlined. Please note that multisyllable words are divided
between syllables with a dot. This dot serves as a cue to assist students in chunking
syllables and will be omitted in later units.

Repeated reading is an important way to improve reading. It can be fun for your
student to repeatedly read this story to a friend, relative, or even a pet.


**The Campsite**


Sa·ni came and
picked us up in his truck.
We drove for miles to
get to the camp·site.


“Do·ba,” I said, “what
is this place?”


“Well,” said Do·ba,
“take a look. See all the
sand, rocks, and stones?
This land is not good for
farming, but it’s good for
hik·ing.”


Foundational Skills 5



**75**


“And it’s good land for
camp·ing!” said Sa·ni.

When we got to the camp·site,
we had to un·pack sleep·ing bags,
tents, lan·terns, ma **tch** ·es, and lots
of food. We lugged it all to the
camp·site.

Sa·ni chose a spot to set up
camp. Gad and I helped set up
the tents. It took us a long time.

For dinn·er we had hot dogs. We
stuck them on sticks and held them
in the fire. My hot dog got all black
be·cause I left it in there too long.
Gad gave me one of his.

That was when I said to my·self,
“Gad is OK!”

The best book ev·er is called The Green
Fern Zoo. In the book, a zoo keep·er named
Vern takes chil·dren in to see the zoo and meet
all of the critt·ers. I like this book a lot be·cause
Vern tells lots of fun facts that des·cribe all
of the critt·ers. The snap·shots are fan·tas·tic
be·cau se they make you feel like you are in the
zoo and close to the critt·ers. You should pick
up The Green Fern Zoo be·cau se it is a book
you will not for·get!

Our class has been reading stories from _Kate’s Book_ . Your student can tell you
about the adventures Kate has been having with Doba and their friends Sani and Gad.
Remember that reading at home with your student is important for their success as
a reader.

The spelling words for this week contain the /t/, /d/, and /f/ sounds. Your student can
practice reading and writing these words, as well as clap the syllables for them. The last
spelling word is a Tricky Word. Tricky Words do not play by the rules, meaning there are
spellings that do not sound the way students would expect them to. These words need to be
memorized.

This is a story your student has probably read once, possibly several times, at school.
Encourage your student to read the story to you and then talk about it together. The tricky
parts in Tricky Words are underlined. Please note that multisyllable words are divided
between syllables with a dot. This dot serves as a cue to assist students in chunking
syllables and will be omitted in later units.

Repeated reading is an important way to improve reading. It can be fun for your
student to repeatedly read this story to a friend, relative, or even a pet.


**The Visit**

Af·ter tell·ing us the story, Sa·ni
said, “It’s time to pack up the food.”

We stuffed the food in·to a lar **ge**
pack with a rope on it. Sa·ni tossed
the rope up in·to a tree and hoist·ed
the food pack up so that it was
hang·ing ten feet off of the ground.

“Paw-paw,” said Gad, “why do
we have to keep the food up in the
tree?”

“Be·cau se it will keep the food
safe from fox·es and rabb·its that
would like to snack on it,” Sa·ni said.

Af·ter that, we crawled in·to the
tents, flipped off our lan·terns, and
went to sleep.

Do·ba and I slept well un·til a
loud clatt·er out·side woke us up.

“What was that?” I asked. “I can’t
tell,” said Do·ba, as she hugged me
close to her.


Sa·ni ran out·side with his lan·tern
and yelled, “Get out of here! Scram!
Get lost!”


When we went out, we saw Sa·ni
and Gad stand·ing there. Sa·ni had
his lan ~~·~~ tern.


“Sa·ni,” Do·ba asked, “who came
to vis ~~·~~ it?”


“I did not see it,” said Sa·ni, “but
I’m bett·ing it was a fox who was
look·ing for some scraps of food. He
bumped in·to the pots and pans. The clatt·er of the pots
and pans must have scared him off.”


“Is that why we hoist·ed the food pack up in the
tree?” Gad asked.


“That’s why!” said Sa·ni.

**The Hike**

The next morn·ing, we went on a hike.
Af·ter a bit, we stopped for lunch.

When Gad fin·ished his lunch, he
asked, “Can Kate and I look for rocks?”

Sa·ni said OK.

“Kate,” Gad said to me, “bring your
fork. We can use it to dig up rocks.”

I grabbed my fork, and we went off
to look for rocks.

Gad point·ed at a bump on the side of a cliff and said,
“Let’s dig that rock out!”

The rock did not look all that lar **ge** . But when we start·ed
digg·ing, we soon saw that it was lar **g** ·er than it had seemed.

Af·ter a bit, Gad said, “ **G** ee! It must be two feet long! We
need to keep scra **tch** ·ing in or·der to car **ve** it out of the side
of the cliff.”

We went on scra **tch** ·ing with our forks.

“Let’s tug on it!” Gad said “I bet
we can get it out by our·sel **ve** s.”

We grabbed and tugged it.

It popped out. But so did a big
cloud of sand and dust. Gad and I
fell down.

Once the dust and sand had
drift·ed off, I saw Gad stand·ing
there with the thing in his hands.

“It’s not a rock!” he yelled. “It’s a
bone!”

It was the bigg·est bone I had
ev·er seen. It was three feet long!

Sa·ni and Do·ba came runn·ing. When she saw the bone,
Do·ba looked upset.

“Are you alright?” I asked. She did not say.

“Will you tell me, Kate, where you found that large bone?”

Gad point·ed to the spot where we found it.

“Goodness!” she said. “It was in the cliff.”

“What is done, is done.” said Sa·ni. “Let’s look at it.”

Sa·ni set the bone on the ground. Then he took a
pic·ture of the bone and said, “We need to get an ex·pert
to look at this bone and tell us what sort of bone it is.”

This is a story your student has probably read once, possibly several times, at school.

student to repeatedly read this story to a friend, relative, or even a pet.


**We Are TV Stars**


We drove back to Do·ba’s cab·in and got
there just in time to see our·sel **ve** s on TV.


The TV man said, “This is Ro **g** ·er Fle **tch** ·er.
I’m stand·ing here on the site where two
chil·dren have found the bones of a rap·tor.”


Then Gad and I saw our·sel **ve** s on TV.


“Woo-hoo!” I shout·ed. “We are TV stars!”


Then came the part where the TV man
asked Gad his name, and Gad looked like he
was scared of the mike.


“Gad, you goof!” I said. “Why did you
jump back like that?”


Gad just shrugged.


Next the TV man asked me my name.

I said, “I’m Kate.” Then I waved.


“Gad,” said the TV man, “where did
you spot the bone?”


Gad said, “It was stick [·] ing out of the
side of a cliff.”


“What did you use to dig it out?”


“We used our forks!” said Gad.


Then we saw the close-up of Gad and
me with our forks.


“So there you have it!” said the TV
man. “I’m Ro **g** [·] er Fle **tch** [·] er with a tale of
two chil·dren, two forks, and one lar **ge**
rap·tor!”

**Do·ba’s Book**


Gad and I and the rap·tor were on TV
six times. I was glad when it came to an end.
Af·ter you smile and wave a fork six times,
it gets to be less fun.


One morn [·] ing, Do·ba hand [·] ed me a book
and said, “Let’s drive to the book shop.”


“Do·ba,” I said, “why do you need to
get a book at the book shop when you have
this one?”


“I just fin·ished that one,” Do·ba said,
“I liked it a lot. And it just so happ·ens that
the man who **wr** ote it will be at the book
shop to·day. I’d like to meet him.”


In the car I looked at the book. It said
“Dust Up, by Si·mon Chee.”


“What sort of book is this?” I asked.

**159**


“It’s a book by a Na·va·jo man,” said Do·ba. “His name
is Si·mon Chee.”


“What does he **wr** ite on?”


“Pa·per,” smiled Do·ba.


“Do·ba!”


“Just a joke,” said Do·ba. “Si·mon Chee writes down
old stor·ies of the Na·va·jo.”


“Why not?”


“Yes!” Do·ba said. “And about the Na·va·jo today, too.
Not just in the past.”


I looked at the last pa **g** e and saw the pa **g** e num [·] ber:
305.


“Yikes!” I said. “This is a long book!”


“It is,” said Do·ba. “But it felt short to me be [·] cau se I
liked it so much. I was sad when I got to the end!”


I start [·] ed to look in [·] side
the book, but just then
Do·ba said, “Here we are!”

**The Book Shop**

In the book shop, there was a big stack
of books. Next to the books sat Si·mon
Chee, the man who **wr** ote the books. He
had a pen in his hand and a big smile on
his lips.

“You’d smile too if your book were
sell [·] ing as well as his is!” Do·ba said.

Do·ba and I went and stood in line to
meet Si·mon Chee.

Do·ba shook hands with him and said,
“I’ **ve** got twel **ve** of your books. This one
was your best book yet!”

The man smiled and said, “That’s sweet
of you! I hope you will pick up my next
one, too!”

“I will!” said Do·ba.

Then the man **wr** ote, “Best wish [·] es,
Si·mon Chee,” in Do·ba’s book.

“Mis [·] ter Chee,” I asked, “how hard
was it to **wr** ite that book?”

“Well,” he said, “this one was not all
that hard. The last one I did was a lot
hard [·] er.”

As we got back in the car, I said,
“Do·ba, I’d like to **wr** ite a book.”

“What sort of book would it be?”
Do·ba asked.

“Well,” I said, “Gad and I found the
rap·tor.”

“Yes, you did,” said Do·ba.

“And you and I found that coin.”

“Yes,” said Do·ba.

“So it could be a book a·bout all
of that.”

“Why not?” said Do·ba. “If you **wr** ite it,
I will make the pic [·] tures.”

I said, “Shake on it!” Then we shook
hands.

**We Make a Book**


When we got back to Do·ba’s, I start·ed to
**wr** ite the book. I **wr** ote down all of the cool
stuff that happ·ened to me out West. The
hard·est part was gett·ing start·ed. Once I
got started, it went fast.


Do·ba helped me pick out good words.
Some ~~[·]~~ times when you **wr** ite, you have to **wr** ite
things two or three times to get all of the best
words and get them in the best or [·] der.


Gad helped me out, too. He said, “I can
help you with spell [·] ing. I am the best spell [·] er
in my class.” Gad looked at what I had
**wr** itt [·] en and fixed a lot of spell [·] ing mis [·] takes
that I had made.

**163**


When I had **wr** itt [·] en the words, Do·ba
got out her brush and start [·] ed to make
the art. It took her a long time. She sent
the pic [·] tures to me three weeks af [·] ter I
went home.


My dad took me and my book to a pal
of his to see if he would pub [·] lish the book.


The man looked at it and said, “This is
well- **wr** itt [·] en! Chil·dren out there will like
this book. I’d like to print it!”


I was so glad, I shout [·] ed, “Yipp [·] ee!”


The man and his staff got the book
all set to pub [·] lish. Then they sent it to a
print [·] er.


I hope you liked the book.


If you’d like to **wr** ite me a lett [·] er, you
can send it to me at this add [·] ress:
