# **Welcome!**
## Grade 1, Unit7 Foundational Skills

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will learn spelling alternatives for vowel sounds, conjunctions, commas, and noun-verb

agreement in sentences. Students will also be introduced to instructional writing.


**What** **will** **my** **student** **learn?**


Students will review previously learned alternatives for vowel sounds and will learn new ones, such as /ae/ spelled

‘ai’ and ‘ay’. They will also learn /oe/ spelled ‘oa’. Students will learn strategies and how to use context clues to

self-correct when reading words with these sounds. Students will read stories and answer questions about two

friends named Kay and Martez. The stories use history and geography topics from this grade level. Students will

learn about using the conjunctions _and_, _but_, and _or_ in writing and will learn about commas as punctuation marks

that separate items in a series. In addition, students will begin to explore instructional and opinion writing.


**Additional** **Practice**

Students can practice these words each night by doing the following activity:

sentences that demonstrate the meaning of each word and explain its context.

|Words That Follow a Spelling<br>Pattern|Col2|Col3|

Students can practice these words each night by doing the following activities:


1. **Word** **Challenges:** Challenge your student to find words with the focus spelling patterns in books, in

magazines, or around the house. When they identify a word, discuss its spelling and meaning.

2. **Complete** **Take-Home** **Activities:** Your student’s teacher will send take-home activities to work on together

and support your student’s progress.
