**Grade 1 | Foundational Skills 4**
Introduction


~~**FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS 4 OVERVIEW**~~


**New Sounds and Spellings**


In this unit you will introduce the sounds that are sometimes called the r-controlled vowel sounds
and the most common (or least ambiguous) spelling for each sound:


  - /er/ spelled ‘er’ as in _her_


  - /ar/ spelled ‘ar’ as in _car_


  - /or/ spelled ‘or’ as in _for_


The Spelling Cards for the /r/-controlled vowel sounds are printed in blue, and students will outline
the Spelling Cards in their Individual Code Charts with blue markers. This signals that these sound/
spellings differ because the /r/ sound, which is a consonant with certain vowel-like qualities, combines
with the vowel sounds that precede it to create something new and different. The /er/ sound in _her_ is
certainly not the same as /e/ + /r/. It is a single, distinctive sound. The same is true of /ar/ as in _car_ ; it
is not the same as /a/ + /r/. Similarly, the sound /or/ differs markedly from /o/ + /r/.


**Vowel Sounds with /r/**


In this program, the sounds /er/ as in _her_, /ar/ as in _car_, and /or/ as in _for_ are classified as
r-controlled vowel sounds rather than vowel + consonant combinations. In this program, /er/, /ar/,
and /or/ are treated as discrete phonemes. These sounds are the result of co-articulation between
the /r/ sound and the preceding vowel sound. You may wish to give students a general sense that
the /r/ sound has a tendency to change preceding vowel sounds. They may need to try some vowel
+ ‘r’ words different ways in order to determine the correct pronunciation.


**Two-Syllable Words**


In this unit you will introduce the concept of a syllable. So far, students have encountered only
single-syllable words in their Readers. To read single-syllable words successfully, they needed only
to recognize the sound/spelling patterns that they have been taught and then decode the words
using this knowledge. Reading multisyllable words presents an additional challenge. As a fluent
adult reader, it may seem as if you simply read multisyllable words as a “whole” or single unit.
However, this is only because you have had extensive practice with many multisyllable words that
are now very familiar to you. Think about an instance in which you have encountered an unfamiliar
multisyllable word and the process you may have used to try to figure out how to read and say the
word: you likely tried to read parts or syllables of the word, one at a time.


Introduction
**1**


This is precisely the manner in which this program will teach students to read longer and longer
multisyllable words. In order to do so successfully, students must be able to chunk multisyllable
words into parts. As is the case with all skills taught in this program, this practice is introduced in
a very scaffolded way initially. Only after much practice and success will students be expected to
chunk and read multisyllable words on their own.


Students will be taught that every syllable has a vowel sound. Attention to syllables begins with oral
practice first. Students are asked to listen to words pronounced orally by the teacher, taking note of
the number of vowel sounds heard in a word. They are asked to clap the number of vowel sounds/
syllables heard in a word as a way of segmenting the syllables. The first words presented orally are
two-syllable compound words. A compound word by its very structure is easily recognizable as
a word with two parts or syllables since each part is also a semantically meaningful unit or word.
Compound words are divided into syllables between the two words (e.g., _week•end_, _foot•ball_ ).


After oral syllabification practice, students are next introduced to written compound words.
Students are not yet expected to chunk or group the syllables of these words on their own as
they attempt to read them. So instead, the written compound word is divided into easily
distinguishable parts.


The multisyllable words that students encounter in their Reader and Activity Book in this unit will
be divided between syllables with a dot. When writing multisyllable words on the board/chart paper,
you should also use the dot as a syllable break. This dot serves as an early cue for students who
are just beginning to read multisyllable words. The dot will be omitted in later Grade 1 units and
students will be expected to chunk words on their own.


After practice with compound words, students will be introduced to other types of two-syllable
words. They will encounter two-syllable words that consist of a root word and a grammatical suffix
(e.g., – _ing_, – _ed_ ) or a root word with a word formation suffix (e.g., – _less_, – _er_ ). As was the case with
compound words, a root word is a semantically meaningful unit that is easily recognizable as a
distinct part or syllable. When written, these two-syllable words will also be divided into parts with
a dot. Root words that end in a suffix are divided into syllables before the suffix (e.g., _hunt•ing_,
_point•ed_, _hunt•er_ ). Most students find chunking and decoding two-syllable words consisting of root
words and suffixes relatively easy.


A slightly greater challenge is presented by two-syllable words that do not have easily discernible
semantic units or syllables. Two-syllable words of this type are carefully controlled to provide a
gradual introduction to the decoding of these more challenging words. Two-syllable words generally
are divided as follows:


     - Two-syllable words in which two different consonants separate the two vowels, divide between the
consonants (e.g., _or•bit_, _pic•nic_, _tar•get_ ).


     - Two-syllable words in which three different consonants separate the two vowels generally divide so
the first consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel
(e.g., _pil•grim_, _mon•ster_, _con•tract_ ).


Foundational Skills 4
**2**


**It is worth noting that, in this program two-syllable words that contain double-consonant**
**spellings are divided after the double-letter spelling rather than between the two consonants**
**(e.g., batt·ed, bigg·er, bunn·y).** The division of words in this way differs from the manner in
which these words are usually syllabicated in dictionaries, so you may initially find this odd. This is
done, however, because the double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units since
Kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.) and it is best to be consistent in representing
these spellings in the way that students have been taught to process them (e.g., as whole entities
for a sound). (Ultimately as students become more proficient at decoding and chunking syllables
through subsequent grade levels, it really does not matter whether they visually chunk and decode
these words as _batt·ed_ or _bat·ted_ .)


In order to effectively teach students how to chunk multisyllable words into decodable parts, it is
imperative that you, as the teacher, be knowledgeable about the structure of the English language,
including typical syllable types. Students can rely on the dots as syllable dividers in this unit and will
not yet be required to chunk or segment two-syllable words on their own. It is important, however,
that you understand how words are broken into syllables. It is strongly recommended that you
thoroughly review the Appendix, Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words before teaching
Lesson 7 of this unit.


**Tricky Words**


In this unit, you will introduce three new Tricky Words that students will encounter in their Reader:
_today, yesterday_, and _tomorrow_ (Lesson 8). In addition, the word _because_ and the names of the days
of the week will also be introduced as Tricky Words in Spelling activities. Please be sure to add these
words to the Tricky Word Wall.


**Decodable Reader: The Green Fern Zoo**


The Reader for Unit 4 is _The Green Fern Zoo_ . The main character, Vern, introduces students to
all different types of animals, from mandrills to puffins. While Vern is a fictional character, the
information in the book is factual, making this an informational text. You will notice that this Reader
includes new text features that are often part of informational texts, such as headings within each
chapter and a simple picture glossary at the end of the Reader. Students will learn to use these text
features to locate key facts and information in each chapter. Additionally, please note that the word
critters is used as a slang term within context for added interest in the Reader.


There is no Big Book for this unit. If you feel that you need to demonstrate the stories, you can
use the digital files found in the program’s online materials for this Reader. You should continue to
observe student performance, monitoring individual students and noting progress in the Anecdotal
Reading Record. Each story is accompanied by a set of oral discussion questions. Please discuss
these questions with students and encourage them to answer in complete sentences.


Story questions activity pages are included. Students will begin to write the date on their activity
pages, paying attention to capitalization and the placement of commas. Students are asked to
answer the questions on the activity page using complete sentences, and rereading of the stories is
recommended.


Introduction
**3**


After the sounds /er/, /ar/, and /or/ have been taught, students should be able to write a plausible
spelling for almost any word. They will have been taught at least one way to write 43 of the 44
sounds in the English language. The only sound for which a spelling has not been introduced is the
very rare consonant sound /zh/ as in _treasure_ (which, for the time being, can be written as if it were
/sh/). When assessing student performance on written activities, accept all phonetically plausible
spellings without correction. For example, you should accept _berd_ for _bird_ and _snor_ for _snore_ .


**Grammar**


Students are introduced to past-tense verb forms ending with – _ed_ . The letters ‘ed’ at the end of a
regular verb indicate that the verb is in the past tense and describes something that has already
occurred. These letters can be pronounced /d/ as in _rammed_, /t/ as in _marked_, or /ed/ as in
_started_ . The pronunciation is governed by the sound that precedes the past-tense ending. The whole
system is very regular, though most of us are not aware of it.


The letters ‘ed’ are pronounced /d/ (a voiced sound) when they are attached to a root word that ends in a
voiced sound (e.g., _seemed, signed, played_ ). They are pronounced /t/ (an unvoiced sound) when they are
attached to a root word that ends in a voiceless sound (e.g., _kicked, ripped, sniffed_ ). They are pronounced
/ed/ when they are attached to a root word that ends in /t/ or /d/ (e.g., _batted, sledded, started_ ). Notice
that it is the previous sound that determines the pronunciation, not the letter.


It should also be noted that when creating the past tense of a verb in which the root already ends
with an ‘e’, a second ‘e’ is not added.

|smile|>|smiled|(not smileed)|
|---|---|---|---|
|bake|>|baked|(not_bakeed_)|
|skate|>|skated|(not_skateed_)|



There is a certain ambiguity in words like _smiled_ and _baked_ . It is not completely clear what role the
‘e’ is playing in words like these. It could be any of the following:


     - the ‘e’ is part of the spelling for the vowel sound ( _sm_ **i** _l_ **e** _d_ );


      - the ‘e’ is part of the – _ed_ ending _(smil_ **ed** ); or


     - the ‘e’ is doing two “jobs”; it is part of the spelling for the vowel sound and part of the past-tense
ending – _ed_ ( _sm_ **i** _l_ **ed** ).


The best approach with students is to say that the ‘e’ does two jobs. In _The Green Fern Zoo_, we bold
the last two letters in words like _smiled_ to show that the ‘e’ is part of the – _ed_ ending, but you are
encouraged to tell students that the ‘e’ is also part of the spelling for the vowel sound.


Foundational Skills 4
**4**


Students do not need to be aware of the patterns explained here, but they do need to learn to
recognize words ending in – _ed_ as past-tense verbs, and they need to understand that the letters
‘ed’ are pronounced differently in different words. Mastery will come with practice, and students
will often find that their mouths will direct them to the correct pronunciation. Few students will read
_baked_ as /b/ /ae/ /k/ /d/ because it is quite difficult to say a voiced /d/ after a voiceless /k/, and
most will learn to set aside the pronunciation /b/ /ae/ /k/ /e/ /d/ since it sounds wrong.


In addition to the past-tense marker – _ed_, students will continue to work with nouns and verbs in
phrases, and be introduced to adjectives. Students will practice identifying and marking nouns,
verbs, and adjectives. Verb tense and the concept of past, present, and future will be discussed.


**Spelling**


Weekly spelling lists and assessments continue in this unit. While most of the spelling lists continue to
be made up of words with letter-sound correspondences that students have already been introduced
to in reading, you will also introduce the days of the week as both spelling words and Tricky Words.


Students will also create a Dictation Journal that focuses on spelling words in isolation as well as
in sentences. Spelling assessments will incorporate a phrase or sentence that students must spell
correctly.


  - For the dictation journal, you can either have students use a journal they use for other writing
activities or you may wish to create a small dictation journal for each student. Stapling five pieces of
paper together is all you will need for each journal. (1)


**Writing**


Writing lessons continue teaching descriptive writing. Students will practice thinking about the five
senses to describe objects, and they will then describe and write informational text about an animal
from _The Green Fern Zoo_ . You may wish to incorporate digital resources, such as video clips or
informational websites, for students to use to gather more information about their animal.


Students should be able to produce plausible spelling or spelling alternatives for nearly every sound
in any word they want to write. Plausible, but not dictionary correct spelling, like _hunee_ for _honey_,
should be accepted at this point, though they can be corrected if written work is being prepared for
“publication.”


**Left-Handed Handwriting Guidance**


  - Consider your seating arrangement for left-handed students. The placement of the arms and elbows
in relation to other students can impact their writing space.


  - Encourage your students to hold their writing tools correctly to reduce hand strain. Allow time for
students to develop their hand strength in writing.


Introduction
**5**


     - Providing pencil grips for students could alleviate the strain on their hands when writing.


     - Orienting the paper at an angle can help left-handed students write more easily and comfortably.
Consider using paper with a raised line for students to rest their hands on as they write.


~~**UNIT 4 ASSESSMENTS**~~


**Formative Assessments and Additional Support**


In addition to the weekly spelling assessments, formative assessments are clearly marked for
monitoring individual student performance and progress in the following key skills:


     - Oral reading of decodable stories: Observation records for recording student performance in the
form of an Anecdotal Reading Record and Discussion Questions Observation Record are included
in Teacher Resources.


     - Written responses to story comprehension questions: You will be prompted to collect and review
activity book pages for specific lessons.


     - Sound/spellings taught in this unit—/er/ > ‘er,’ /ar/ > ‘ar,’ and /or/ > ‘or’: Again you will be prompted
to collect specific activity pages.


Quick “Checks for Understanding” to evaluate classroom performance as a whole are also
designated in various lessons.


Careful attention to this information, collected on a daily basis, will enable teachers to quickly
determine which students may benefit from reteaching and/or more practice in particular skills
using the Additional Support activities found at the end of each lesson.


**Student Performance Assessment**


In Lessons 25–28, you will be prompted to administer a multipart Mid-Year Assessment. In the
Dictation Assessment, students will be asked to spell and write words with the r-controlled spellings
taught in this unit. All students will also complete a Grammar Assessment in which they will be
asked to identify nouns and verbs in a set of sentences, change verbs to past tense in another set of
sentences, and match contractions with their noncontracted equivalent. All students will also read a
new grade-level, informational text selection about a bat and will then answer literal and inferential
comprehension questions. Finally, each student will work with you one-on-one to complete the
Word Reading in Isolation Assessment which evaluates each student’s ability to read words with
the letter-sound correspondences taught thus far. Detailed error analysis forms and guidelines for
interpretation are included.


**It is important that you take the time to administer all of these assessments at the end of**
**Unit 4 to ensure that all students are making adequate progress. Student performance on**
**these assessments should inform the next steps for grouping and instruction, and determine**
**whether there is a need to remediate any gaps in code knowledge. This is a critical time of the**


Foundational Skills 4
**6**


**year instructionally when it is important to decide if a student needs minimal or significant**
**remediation. It is highly recommended that all Grade 1 teachers meet as a grade level team**
**after all students have completed the Mid-Year Assessment to determine whether regrouping**
**of some students between teachers is warranted to best meet students’ needs.**


~~**PAUSING POINT**~~


An extensive listing of additional activities to teach and practice the Unit 4 skills can be found in
Pausing Point section included after the last lesson. It is strongly recommended that you pause for
3 days and provide targeted remediation for individual or groups of students in any areas in which
they performed poorly on the end-of-unit assessment.


In the Pausing Point, handwriting activity pages are also provided. You may want to use these
handwriting sheets for morning or seat work.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


In the Teacher Resources section at the end of this Teacher Guide, you will find forms and charts
which may be useful, including the following:

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


The sound /er/ has a variety of spellings: ‘er’, ‘ur’, ‘ir’, ‘or’, ‘ear’, ‘ar’, ‘urr’, and
‘our’. The most common spelling is ‘er’. Also note that the Tricky Words
_word_ and _were_ contain the sound /er/. Students will mark this spelling in
their Individual Code Charts in the color blue: unlike all of the letter-sound
correspondences, which are either red (consonants) or green (vowels),
r-controlled letter-sound correspondences are designated in blue.


Starting today students will be asked to write the name of the day of the
week and date on their activity pages, practicing the capitalization of the
day and month and correct comma placement.

Code Materials



Lesson 1 Basic Code: Introduce /er/ > ‘er’
**13**


Support


It can be hard to say the
/r/ sound in isolation. Tell
students to try not to add
a vowel sound before /r/
because this will make it
difficult to distinguish the
difference between /r/
and /er/. To say /r/, start
saying the word _red_ and
stop before saying the
vowel sound.


**14**



Check for Understanding


Walk around as students trace the ‘er’ on their desks and listen to make sure

students are making the correct /er/ sound.


 - Explain that the vowel sound /er/ is not the same as the consonant sound /r/
that they learned earlier.


 - Write the words _red_ and _her_ on the board/chart paper and read both words.
Have students listen carefully to the difference between the sound /r/ in the
word _red_ and the sound /er/ in _her_ . Say the /r/ sound rapidly, but stretch
out the /er/ sound. This will emphasize the difference between the clipped
consonant sound /r/ and the vowel sound /er/.


 - Explain that the sound /er/ is not the same as the vowel sound /e/ followed
by the sound /r/.


 - Write the words _hem_ and _her_ on the board/chart paper and read both words.
Have students listen carefully to the difference between the sound /e/ in the
word _hem_ and the sound /er/ in the word _her_ .


**Individual Code Chart**


1. /er/ > ‘er’ ( _her_ ) **page 5**


 - Have students find the ‘er’ spelling on **Individual Code Chart page 5** and
trace the code information in blue marker. Tell students that they are using a
blue marker instead of green because the /er/ sound has both a consonant
and a vowel sound. Remind students that when they see ‘er’ when reading,
they can look at the Individual Code Chart if they need help remembering
how to sound out this spelling.


 - Tell students that whenever the spelling ‘er’ appears on an activity page or in
the Reader for the next few lessons, it will be printed in darker, bolder ink to
remind them that the two letters stand for a single sound.


**Note:** You may have students who know that some of the words they listened
to earlier, such as _nurse_, are written with spellings other than ‘er’. If students
point this out, congratulate them for recognizing this and already knowing
other spellings for the /er/ sound. Tell them that they will learn these
spellings for /er/ at a later time, and for now they just have to focus on the
‘er’ spelling.


Foundational Skills 4


~~**PRACTICE /ER/ › ‘ER’ (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Distribute Activity Page 1.1.


 - Tell students that starting today, they will write the name of the day and
the date on their activity pages. The date is the information that tells the
calendar day, month, and year.


 - Ask students, “What day of the week is today?” Write the day of the week on
the board/chart paper, pointing out that the first letter is capitalized.


 - Tell students that the day of the week is just one part of the information
about the date. Write a comma after the day of the week, and tell students
that this comma shows there is more information to come.


 - Tell students that you will next write the name of the month and the calendar
day (e.g., May 8).


 - Write a comma after the calendar day and tell students that the comma
means there is one more piece of information to include for the date. Ask
students, “We have the day of the week first, and then the month and the
calendar day. What is the last part of the information needed for the date?”


» _year_


 - Write the year. Read the complete date aloud, pausing where there are
commas. Point out that there are two commas, one that separates the day
of the week from the rest of the date and another that separates the date (or
number of the day) from the year. For example, Wednesday, May 8, 2016.


 - Have students write the date under their names on the activity page.


 - Have students trace and copy ‘er’ on the activity page.


 - Encourage students to say the sound /er/ each time they write the letters.


 - Have students look at the back of the activity page. As a class, read the words
in the box at the top and identify the name for each picture below.


 - Tell students to write each word under its matching picture.


**Note:** You can refer to the digraph ‘er’ by its sound or by the letter names.
Continue to encourage students to say the sounds of the individual spellings
as they write the words.

~~**INTRODUCE SPELLING WORDS (15 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.2.C.iv**~~


   - Remind students that they will have a list of spelling words to practice and
learn each week.

   - Tell students that normally the words will only use the spellings that
they have learned, so they can segment and blend each word. This week,
however, all of the words are Tricky Words. Remind students that Tricky
Words do not follow the rules, so their spellings must be memorized.


**TEKS 1.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling words with closed syllables, open syllables, VCe syllables, vowel teams, and r-controlled syllables; (ii) spelling words with initial and final consonant blends, digraphs, and trigraphs;
(iii) spelling words using sound-spelling patterns; (iv) spelling high-frequency words from a research-based list.


Foundational Skills 4


- Tell students that the words are the days of the week, plus one other Tricky
Word they have already learned.


- Say the days of the week together as a class. Point out that all of the days of
the week end with the word _day_ . Write _day_ on the board/chart paper and tell
students that the ‘d’ is pronounced as they would expect, /d/, but ‘ay’ is a
spelling they have not learned yet, and it is pronounced /ae/.


- Read and write each spelling word and have students repeat the word after
you. Tell students that the names of the days of the week are proper nouns,
and ask them, “What do we do to the first letter of proper nouns?” _(We_
_capitalize the first letter of proper nouns.)_


- Have students take out their Dictation Journals. Explain that you will say a

as you read the following tongue twister about a man named Sir Sal:


Sir Sal surfs by the sand,


Stirs the water with his hand.


Sir Sal said, “See me twirl,”


Showing us his super swirl.


 - Ask which two sounds students heard most often. ( _/s/ and /er/_ )


 - Ask, “What spelling did you learn in the last lesson for the /er/ sound? Tell me
other words that have this sound in it.”


 - Read the tongue twister a second time, having students raise their hands
whenever they hear the /er/ sound.


 - Using the oral segmenting routine, have students produce each of the
sounds in in the following words:



1. Sir (2)  /s/ /er/


2. surf (3) /s/ /er/ /f/



3. stirs (4) /s/ /t/ /er/ /s/


4. swirl (4) /s/ /w/ /er/ /l/

- Break the tongue twister into small chunks and read it again, having students
repeat each chunk back to you. See if you can increase your speed with each
repetition:


Sir Sal (pause) surfs by the sand, (pause)


Stirs the water (pause) with his hand. (pause)


Foundational Skills 4

Check for Understanding


Listen to individual students as they repeat the tongue twister to determine if they

can hear and produce the /er/ sound.


~~**WORD SORT: /ER/ OR /R/? (15 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** The sounds /r/ as in _red_ and /er/ as in _her_ are very similar and can be
easily confused when writing. The sound /r/ is usually found at the beginning
of words before a vowel spelling as in _rim, ran_, and _rip_ . The sound /er/ usually
occurs in the middle and at the end of words, as in _fern, butter_, and _bitter_ .

 - Tell students that they will now practice reading and writing words with the
/er/ sound. Explain that the words in the box contain either the sound /r/
spelled ‘r’ or the sound /er/ spelled ‘er’.


 - Read the words in the box together as a class. Ask students to use each word

~~**INTRODUCE CONTRACTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iv**~~


  - Tell students that two Readers ago, they read about the adventurous Gran.
Remind students that Gran got a snake, King, from Hong Kong. Write _Gran’s_
_snake_ on the board/chart paper.


  - Circle the apostrophe. Remind students that this punctuation mark, which
looks like a comma “up in the air,” is called an apostrophe. The apostrophe-‘s’
used with the word _Gran_ shows that something belongs to Gran.


  - Reread the phrase _Gran’s snake_, point to the apostrophe-‘s’ and then ask
students what belongs to Gran. _(the snake)_


  - Write the following examples on the board/chart paper: _Jim’s cat_ and _Kit’s_
_dress_ . Ask students to read each phrase, point to the apostrophe-‘s’ and then
ask, “What belongs to Jim? What belongs to Kit?”


  - Sum up by saying that often when the apostrophe-‘s’ follows a word,
especially a noun, as in the examples on the board/chart paper, it is used to
show possession, or that something belongs to someone or something.


  - Tell students that today they are going to learn a different way that an
apostrophe’ can be used.


  - Write _let us_ on the board/chart paper and have students read it out loud.
Say, “Let us go!” and “Let us read now.” Tell students that although these
sentences are correct, they do not sound like the way we usually speak to
one another. Prompt students as needed to recognize that instead of saying,
“Let us go!” and “Let us read now,” we say, “Let’s go!” and “Let’s read now.”


  - Tell students that you will now show them how to write the word _let’s_ by
using an apostrophe. Write _let’s_ beside _let us_ . Circle the apostrophe and say,
“Here the apostrophe takes the place of a missing letter. What letter did the
apostrophe replace?” _(‘u’)_ Cross out the ‘u’ in the phrase _let us_ .


  - Say a sentence with _let us_ as you write these two words on the board/chart
paper. Then write the sentence with the contraction _let’s_, reminding students
that the apostrophe takes the place of the ‘u’.


**TEKS 1.2.B.iv** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by using knowledge of base words to decode common compound
words and contractions.


Foundational Skills 4


  - Explain that when an apostrophe is used to replace a letter, as in _let’s_, the
new word that is formed is called a contraction. A contraction is a shorter
form of a word or group of words in which an apostrophe replaces a letter
in the word(s).


  - Show students the chart you created in advance and tell them you will use
this chart to record the many new contractions they will learn in this unit.
Write _let us_ in the first column, and _let’s_ in the second column. Ask students,
“Which one is the contraction?” _(let’s)_

you may wish to explain
that in English, two words
are sometimes combined
to make a shorter form
of the two words. The
apostrophe is used to take
the place of the letters we
leave out.

Students will identify the information that different parts of a book provide.


~~**TEKS 1.2.D**~~


Students will use illustrations and texts they are able to read or hear to learn or
clarify word meanings. ~~**TEKS 1.3.B**~~


~~**INTRODUCE THE READER AND CHAPTER (15 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** There is no Big Book for this Reader.


  - Tell students that they will start a new Reader today about a man named
Vern. Write _Vern_ on the board/chart paper and point out that it contains
the ‘er’ spelling for the /er/ sound they have just learned. Vern is the main
character, and there are also many animals in the Reader.


  - Tell students they will learn facts and details about all different types of
animals, and they will also recognize organizational patterns of a text.
Because _The Green Fern Zoo_ provides information and facts about animals,
it is called informational text. ~~**TEKS 1.9.D.i; TEKS 1.9.D.ii; TEKS 1.9.D.iii**~~


  - Explain that informational text provides factual, or real, information about a
topic. The facts are not made up, so this Reader is not fiction. Tell students
that organizational patterns, such as descriptions, are a characteristic of
informational texts. ~~**[TEKS 1.9.D.i; TEKS 1.9.D.ii; TEKS 1.9.D.iii]**~~


  - Remind students that the previous Reader, _Fables_, was fiction and not real
because it contained stories about talking animals.


  - Tell students that the setting for this Reader is the zoo. Write _zoo_ on the
board/chart paper, and ask students if this is a noun or a verb. _(noun)_ Ask if
any students have visited a zoo, and explain that a zoo is a place people can
go to see many different types of animals usually in some type of enclosed
area or cage. The kinds of animals that live at a zoo are generally unusual
animals that you would not easily be able to find or see in your neighborhood.
For example, you would probably not see animals that people keep as pets,
such as dogs or cats, in a zoo. Usually the animals you will see in a zoo are
wild animals.


  - Write _Green Fern Zoo_ and tell students that this is the name of a particular
zoo. Ask students what type of noun this is. _(proper noun)_


  - Tell students that Vern works at the Green Fern Zoo.


  - Have students look at the cover of the book and describe the animal depicted
on the cover. Tell students that this is one of the animals at Green Fern Zoo
that they will learn about in this Reader.


**TEKS 1.9.D** Recognize characteristics and structures of informational text including (i) the central idea and supporting evidence with adult assistance; (ii) features and simple graphics to locate or gain information; (iii) organizational patterns such
as chronological order and description with adult assistance.


Foundational Skills 4


 - Ask students what they think Vern might be saying in the picture. _(He might_
_be saying, “Let’s go into the Green Fern Zoo!”)_


 - Write the word _chapter_ on the board/chart paper. Point to the ‘er’ spelling at
the end of the word, asking students what sound this spelling represents.
_(/er/)_ Guide students in sounding out and pronouncing the word.


 - Now have students turn to the table of contents. Point out the word _chapter_
preceding each title. Read the titles of the chapters, noting that these
chapters are all about different types of animals. Tell students that today
they will read the first chapter, “Meet Vern.” ~~**TEKS 1.2.D**~~

**Preview Spellings**

 - Review the following spellings before reading today’s chapter.

  - Tell students that they will see the contraction _let’s_ in today’s story.


  - Prior to previewing the core vocabulary today, tell students that
informational texts often have special features and organizational patterns
designed to help students understand the facts and information they will
encounter in the text.


  - Have students turn to **page 77** at the end of the Reader and explain that the
list of words and pictures at the end of this Reader is a text feature called
a glossary.


  - Explain that when a glossary is included in a book with informational text, it is
usually placed at the end of the book.


  - Further explain that the purpose of a glossary is to provide a definition, or the
meaning, of a difficult word. Older students use glossaries with only words
and no pictures. However, because this is the first glossary students will use
in the program, pictures are used to explain the words’ meanings.


**TEKS 1.9.D** Recognize characteristics and structures of informational text including (i) the central idea and supporting evidence with adult assistance; (ii) features and simple graphics to locate or gain information; (iii) organizational patterns such

 - Point out that the title of today’s chapter, “Meet Vern,” is at the top of the
page. In this glossary, the words for each chapter are listed on a separate
page. The words are listed in the order that they appear in the chapter.


 - Further explain that the number in parentheses at the end of the word gives
the page number where the word is found in the Reader. Ask students what
they notice about the glossary words for “Meet Vern” and the page(s) where
they are found. ( _All of the vocabulary words are on the same page—page 2_ .)


 - Allow students a few minutes to flip through the other pages in the glossary.


**Note:** Throughout this unit, you will discuss each core vocabulary word
as students look at the word list in the glossary. This should provide an
opportunity for greater student participation. For example, after reading
each word, ask students to examine the picture and attempt to explain the
meaning before you elaborate


Please also note that in some chapters there are additional core vocabulary
words that are not included in the glossary because they are difficult to
illustrate. In this chapter, this is the case with the words _facts_ and _tales_ . Explain
these words in the same manner you usually present core vocabulary.


 - Preview the following vocabulary as students refer to the appropriate
glossary page before reading today’s story. Allow students to ask questions
to clarify the meaning of these words and phrases as necessary:


**fern—n.,** a plant that has large, green leaves (2)

Example: The fern grew so large that its leaves covered the window.

**zoo—n.,** a park area where animals are in cages or large enclosed areas (2)

Example: I saw the lions in cages at the zoo.

**scales—n.,** the outer covering on the skin of snakes and fish; scales protect
the body of the animal (2)

Example: The scales, or skin, on a snake look wet and slimy, but are
actually dry.

**sting—v.,** when an animal (such as a bee or jellyfish) causes a sharp pain in
another animal or human by touching it with part of its body (2)

Example: The bee might sting the boy if he swats at it.

**creep—v.,** to move slowly with the body close to the ground (2)

Example: The spider will creep in the garden.

**facts—n.,** information that is true (2)

Example: Her mother asked the girl to tell her the facts she learned
about zoos.


Foundational Skills 4


**tales—n.,** entertaining stories (2)

Example: Some authors like to write funny tales to make the reader laugh.

  - Explain that another meaning for _scales_ refers to equipment that a person
can stand on to weigh themself. Also explain that another meaning for _creep_
is a person who is mean or not nice. Referring to the image in the glossary, be
sure students understand the meaning of each word as used in this chapter.


**Purpose for Reading**

  - Tell students that they will read today’s story to meet Vern and learn about
the different types of animals at the Green Fern Zoo.


~~**READ “MEET VERN” (10 MIN.)**~~


**Whole Group**

  - Read the story as a class, allowing students to take turns reading a paragraph
aloud. Encourage students to read with expression, and model this for them
if necessary. The rest of the class should follow along in their Readers as a
classmate reads aloud. After students read the second paragraph, ask them
to refer to their glossaries to look up and explain the word _scales_ . Because
today’s story is only one page, there may be an opportunity to reread the
story aloud a second time, so other students have an opportunity to read.

Language


**Primary Focus:** Students will form the contractions _here’s_, _it’s_, _he’s_, and _she’s_,
and will identify which letters the apostrophe replaced. ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iv**~~


~~**REVIEW CONTRACTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that they have now learned two ways in which an
apostrophe can be used. It can be used as an ’s with a noun (person, place,
or thing) to show that something belongs to the noun, such as _Gran’s snake_,
or the _cat’s_ _paw_ . Ask students to share a few more examples in which the
apostrophe shows possession.


  - Remind students that they have also learned that the apostrophe can be
used to replace a letter and make a contraction. A contraction is a shorter
form of a word or several words in which an apostrophe takes the place of
letter(s) from the word(s).


  - Point to the contractions chart and ask students, “What contraction did you
learn the other day?” _(let’s)_ “What two words does _let’s_ stand for?” _(let us)_

words that use the word _is_ . Write _here is_ on the board/chart paper, and say
the sentence, “Here is my book.”


                  - Write _here’s_ beside _here is_ and say the sentence, “Here’s my book.”


                 - Ask, “What letter did the apostrophe take the place of?” _(‘i’)_ Cross out the ‘i’.
Tell students that the word _here’s_ is a contraction; it is a shorter form of the
words _here is_ .


                 - Ask students to share a sentence with _here is_ and then say the same
sentence with _here’s_ .


                - Record _here is_ and _here’s_ on the contraction chart.


                  - Tell students that _is_ can also be combined with the words _it_, _he_, and _she_ .
Follow the same procedure as above: write the two words on the board/
chart paper and use them in a sentence ( _it is_, _he is_, _she is_ ), then write the
contraction ( _it’s_, _he’s_, _she’s_ ) and use it in the same sentence. Have students
provide one or two more example sentences for each phrase and contraction.
Ask students to share what letter the apostrophe takes the place of in each
contraction. Record these contractions on the chart.


                  - Tell students that they will see these contractions in their Reader.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to pair up and tell their partner what two words make the contraction

_let’s. (let us_ ) Repeat process for _here’s, it’s, he’s,_ and _she’s_ . Ask students to share

with their partner two examples in which an apostrophe shows possession.

**Lesson 3: “Meet Vern”**
Reading


**Primary Focus**



20M



Students will ask and answer questions orally and/or in writing about the
informational text “Meet Vern” requiring literal recall and understanding of
the details and/or facts of a nonfiction/informational text read independently.


~~**TEKS 1.4; TEKS 1.6.G**~~


Students will use a resource such as a picture dictionary or digital resource to
find words. ~~**TEKS 1.3.A**~~


~~**REREAD “MEET VERN” (20 MIN.)**~~


**Small Group**

  - Divide students into two groups. You will work with Group 1, students who
need more direct support and immediate feedback, while the students in
Group 2 will partner read.


  - Distribute Activity Page 3.2. As a class, write the date under the name line on
the activity page, reminding students where to place commas. Tell students
they will complete this Activity Page after rereading “Meet Vern.”


  - Ask students to turn to the table of contents in the Reader to locate and read
the title of the first chapter in the Reader. _(“Meet Vern”)_ Ask them to tell you
the page number for the chapter “Meet Vern.” ( _page 2_ )


  - Have students turn to page 77 at the end of the Reader and remind them
that the list of words and pictures is called a glossary. Remind students
that the purpose of a glossary is to provide a definition, or the meaning of a
difficult word. Tell students to use alphabetical order to look up words in a
glossary. ~~**TEKS 1.3.A**~~


**Note:** As today’s chapter is short, you may have time to hear both groups
read. Remember that it is important to hear each student read on a regular
basis. You may use the Anecdotal Reading Record found in the Teacher
Resources section to record notes regarding each student’s progress.


**TEKS 1.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text; **TEKS 1.6.G** Evaluate details
to determine what is most important with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.3.A** Use a resource such as a picture dictionary or digital
resource to find words.

**Code Knowledge**


Before today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
567 and 733 of those words would be completely decodable.


After today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
575 and 741 of those words would be completely decodable.


Students have now learned at least one way to write 42 of the 44 sounds in English.


The sound /ar/ is the thirty-sixth most common sound in English and is found in
approximately 3 percent of English words.


The sound /ar/ is spelled ‘ar’ approximately 96 percent of the time.


There are no major spelling alternatives for this sound.

  - After all the words have been called out, tell students that you will now read a
sentence using one of the words and they will write it on the back of Activity
Page 5.1. Say, “I go to the park on Saturday.”


  - Tell students that you will now show them the correct spelling for each word
so they can correct their own work.


  - Say and write each word on the board/chart paper, instructing students to
correct their work by crossing out any incorrect spelling, and writing the
correct spelling next to it.


**TEKS 1.2.C** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling words with closed syllables, open syllables, VCe

Students will distinguish the /ar/ and /er/ sounds in oral words. ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.vii**~~


Students will identify the number of sounds in oral words with the /ar/ and /er/
sounds and write words with the sounds. ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.vii; TEKS 1.2.C.iii**~~


~~**REVIEW /ER/ AND /AR/ (10 MIN.)**~~


**Hear Medial Sounds**

  - Distribute two index cards per student.


  - Remind students that they have now learned two new sound/spellings for
this unit: ‘er’ for /er/ and ‘ar’ for /ar/.


  - Write /ar/ and /er/ on the board/chart paper in speech bubbles. Tell students
to write the /ar/ sound on one index card, and the /er/ sound on the other.


  - Tell students that the sounds /ar/ as in _car_ and /er/ as in _her_ may sound
similar.


  - Point to /ar/ and have students say the sound several times, stretching it out.
Repeat for /er/.


  - Tell students that you are now going to say words that have either the /ar/ or
/er/ sound in them. They need to listen very carefully to hear the difference.
Some of the words will have /ar/ as the first or middle sound and some will
have /er/ as the middle sound.


  - Tell students that you want them to hold up the /ar/ index card when you say
the /ar/ sound, and hold up the /er/ index card when you say the /er/ sound.


**TEKS 1.2.A.vii** Demonstrate phonological awareness by segmenting spoken one-syllable words of three to five phonemes into
individual phonemes, including words with initial and/or final consonant blends; **TEKS 1.2.C.iii** Demonstrate and apply spelling
knowledge by spelling words using sound-spelling patterns.


Foundational Skills 4

 - Practice first by saying the word _car_ . Students should hold up the /ar/ index
card. Next, say the word _her_ . Students should hold up the /er/ index card.


**Note:** This is a listening exercise. The target sounds /ar/ and /er/ are
spelled with basic code spellings and spelling alternatives that have not
been taught yet.


 - Collect these cards at the end of the activity; they will be used again in
Lesson 20.

~~**PRACTICE /ER/ › ‘ER’ AND /AR/ › ‘AR’ (15 MIN.)**~~


**Dictation with Words**

  - Tell students to take out a pencil and a piece of paper.


  - Explain that you are going to say a number of words. The first four words will
contain the /er/ sound and the last four words will contain the /ar/ sound.


  - Write and then point to the spellings ‘er’ and ‘ar’ on the board/chart paper
next to their respective speech bubbles and have students copy them onto
the top of their paper.


  - Tell students that you will call out a word for them to write. The word will
either include the /ar/ sound, in which case they should use the ‘ar’ spelling,
or the /er/ sound, in which case they should use the ‘er’ spelling.


  - Say each word, then say it again slowly, holding up one finger for each sound.


  - Ask students to count the sounds in the word and then, on their paper, draw
a line for each sound in the word. For example, for the word _her_, two lines
would be drawn on the paper.


  - Once students have drawn one line for each sound in the word, remind them
that the sound /er/ is spelled with two letters, ‘e’ and ‘r’. These two letters
work together and are written on the same line.

The first way is to show possession, or that something belongs to a noun
(person, place, or thing), such as the _shark’s gills_, or _Vern’s zoo_ . Ask students
to share other examples where the apostrophe shows possession.

used to replace a letter and create a shorter form of a word or words, called a
contraction. Use the contraction chart to review how the apostrophe is used
when it replaces a letter.

  - Remind students that when we use an apostrophe to make a shorter form of
the phrase _let us_, the apostrophe takes the place of ‘u’. Have students read
the contraction and use it in a sentence.


  - Remind students that when we use an apostrophe to make a shorter form of
_is_ with other words, the apostrophe takes the place of ‘i’. Read the example
words in the chart, and use them in a sentence, using both the contracted
form and the two-word form.


  - Tell students you will now show them new contractions made from words
combined with the word _not_ . Write _can not_ on the board/chart paper, and say
the sentence, “I can not sleep.”


**Note:** C _an_ _not_ is presented as two words so it can be viewed as decodable
and included in student materials. After two syllable words are taught, please
write _cannot_ as one word and share this information with students.


  - Write _can’t_ beside _can no_ t and say the sentence, “I can’t sleep.”


  - Ask, “In this contraction, the apostrophe takes the place of two letters. What
letters did the apostrophe replace?” _(‘n’ and ‘o’)_ Cross out the ‘n’ and ‘o’.


  - Ask students to share a sentence with _can not_ and then say the same
sentence with _can’t_ .

is also a semantically meaningful unit or word. Students begin reading twosyllable compound words in this lesson. Students are not expected to chunk
or group the syllables of these words on their own at this point. Instead, the
break between syllables are represented with a dot, and students are asked
to sound out each chunk, or syllable, and then blend the parts to read the
complete word. The dot as a syllable break will be used in the writing that
you do on the board/chart paper, as well as in the Activity Book and Reader
whenever multisyllable words are included. This dot serves as an early cue
for students who are just beginning to read multisyllable words. The dot will
be omitted in the later Grade 1 units and students will be expected to chunk
multisyllable words on their own.

**Primary Focus**
Students will identify the vowel sounds in single-syllable words, will count the
number of vowel sounds in two-syllable words, and will distinguish between oneand two-syllable words in pairs. ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.v; TEKS 1.2.A.vi; TEKS 1.2.B.iv**~~


Students will identify the /ar/ and /or/ sounds in oral word pairs. ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.v**~~


Students will decode words with /ie/ > ‘i_e’, /oi/ > ‘oi’, /ar/ > ‘ar’, /er/ > ‘er’, and the
Tricky Word _your_ in written phrases. ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iii**~~


Students will learn the sound/spelling /or/ > ‘or’, and will orally produce words with
/er/, /ar/, and /or/. ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.v; TEKS 1.2.B.iii**~~


Students will decode words with r-controlled syllables, reading one-syllable words
with /or/ > ‘or’ and then writing each word under its corresponding picture.

~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iii; TEKS 1.2.F**~~


~~**INTRODUCE TWO-SYLLABLE WORDS (15 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** The goal of this exercise is for students to recognize that every syllable
contains exactly one vowel sound.


  - Remind students that in Kindergarten they learned how to segment and
blend words into individual sounds using the following steps for segmenting:
start with the word, tap their fingers, and slowly say each sound. When they
say the sounds all at once to say the word, they are blending.


  - Use the finger-tapping gestures to practice segmenting and blending each of
the following words into individual sounds: _hat_, _shark_, _bike_ .

Foundational Skills 4


  - After segmenting and blending each word, ask students how many sounds
are in each word. _(Each of these words has three sounds.)_ Then repeat each
word, now asking students to listen for how many vowel sounds are in each
word. _(one)_


  - Summarize by telling students that they already know how to count
individual sounds in words. Today they are going learn about another way to
talk about words and parts of words and that is by talking about how many
syllables there are in a word.


  - Explain that you can count how many syllables are in a word if you know how
many vowel sounds are in the word: a word has the same number of syllables
as it has vowel sounds. Repeat the word _hat_ and again ask students how
many vowel sounds they hear. _(one)_ Then ask how many syllables are in the
word _hat_ . _(one)_


  - Write the word _hat_ on the board/chart paper and have students read the
word aloud.


  - Circle the ‘a’ in _hat_ and point out that the spelling ‘a’ stands for the vowel
sound /a/. There is one vowel sound, so this is a one-syllable word.


  - A syllable may contain several consonant sounds, like /h/ and /t/ in _hat_, or it
may have no consonant sounds, but a syllable must always contain only one
vowel sound.


**Note:** Remember that sometimes multiple letters work together to create
one vowel sound (e.g., the ‘i’ and ‘e’ in _bike_ work together to stand for the /ie/
sound, and the ‘o’, ‘u’, ‘l’ in _could_ work together to stand for the /oo/ sound.)
Pay attention to the vowel sound, not the spelling.


  - Tell students that they can feel the syllables in a word by placing a hand, palm
down, under their chin. As they say _hat_, they will feel their chin dip once for
the one vowel sound. The chin dips because the mouth is opening to make a
vowel sound.


  - Tell students that we can clap our hands for each syllable in a word. Point to
the word _hat_, and ask, “If _hat_ has one syllable, how many times will we clap
our hands?” Say _hat_ at the same time you clap your hands one time, and
have students repeat this after you.


  - Tell students that a word with two vowel sounds is a two-syllable word. Ask,
“If a word has two syllables, how many times will we clap our hands?”


  - Say the word _bathtub_, asking students to repeat it after you, holding their
hand under their chin. Ask how many vowel sounds they hear. _(two)_ Then ask
how many syllables are in the word _bathtub_ . _(two)_ Finally, ask students to
say the word _bathtub_ as they simultaneously clap two times to represent the
two syllables.


Lesson 7 Basic Code: Introduce Two-Syllable Words and /or/ › ‘or’
**79**


 - Write the word _bathtub_ on the board/chart paper. Tell students that this is
the word they just practiced aloud, clapping out the syllables. Remind them
that the word has two syllables. Explain that this is the way this two-syllable
word is normally written in books for older students and adults.


 - Now, write the word with a dot, showing the break in syllables: _bath • tub_ .
Explain that because students have only read one-syllable words so far, you
are going to give them a little help in seeing how to divide or chunk longer
words into two syllables by putting a dot between syllables to help them
sound out the word in parts.


 - Explain that the word _bathtub_ is called a compound word: it is made up of two
separate, single-syllable words. Point to each part of the word, encouraging
students to sound out each part with you.


 - Ask students how many vowel sounds are in the word. _(two)_ Circle the letters
(‘a’ and ‘u’) that stand for the two vowel sounds /a/ and /u/.


 - Now practice orally with each of the words in the box below. Have students
say each word with their hand underneath their chin, then say it again while
clapping the syllable(s).


**Note:** Do not write these words on the board/chart paper. Students are first
asked to listen and clap out the number of syllables that they hear, and not
all words below are decodable at this time.


**One- and Two-Syllable Words**



1. cake—cup•cake


2. drop—gum•drop



3. pack—back•pack


4. day—birth•day



**80**




- Now write _cup•cake_ (including the dot in the middle) on the board/chart
paper. Tell students that this word is made up of two words: _cup_ and _cake_ .
Point to the dot in the word, reminding them that the dot helps us to see
where this word is separated into syllables.


- Explain that a good way to read a two-syllable compound word is to treat it
like reading two one-syllable words. Students should first sound and blend
the spellings in the first syllable/word, then sound and blend the spellings in
the second syllable, and then put them together: 1. /c/ . . . /u/ . . . /p/; blend
to make _cup_ ; 2. /c/ . . . /ae/ . . . /k/; blend to make _cake_ ; 3. assemble the
chunks: _cup_ + _cake_ = _cup•cake_ .


Foundational Skills 4


**Note:** This type of decoding is called the three-step or chunking method
(blend the sounds in the first syllable; blend the sounds in the second
syllable; assemble the chunks).


 - Write these two-syllable compound words on the board/chart paper,
including the dot: _gum•drop, back•pack_ . Ask students to tell you the two
words that make up each compound word. As a class, practice reading the
words using the three-step method and clapping the syllables for each word.


Check for Understanding


Say the following additional words, and have students repeat aloud. To determine

that students can differentiate between one- and two-syllable words, have students

raise one arm when they hear a one-syllable word and raise two arms when they hear

a two-syllable word.



1. bedtime


2. mad


3. breakfast


4. haystack



5. toothpaste


6. pop


7. hopscotch


8. fireman



~~**INTRODUCE THE SOUND /OR/ (10 MIN.)**~~


**Minimal Pairs**

 - Tell students that today’s sound is /or/ as in _for_ .


 - Have students say the /or/ sound several times, stretching it out.


 - Ask students to repeat a number of words that have the /or/ sound at the
beginning: _or_, _orbit_, _orphan_, _order_, _orchid_ .


 - Ask students to repeat a number of words that have the /or/ sound in the
middle: _north_, _porch_, _sport_, _corn_, _fork_ .


 - Ask students to repeat a number of words that have the /or/ sound at the
end: _store_, _snore_, _sore_, _door_, _floor_ .


 - Distribute the index cards with /ar/. Pass out a new blank index card to each
student and have them write /or/ on it. Remind them that the letters ‘or’ in
slashes stand for the /or/ sound.

 - Explain that the sound /or/ is not the same as the vowel sound /o/ followed
by the consonant sound /r/.


 - Have students listen carefully to the difference between the vowel sounds in
the following word pairs: _fox—for_, _box—bore_, _mop—more_ .


 - Have students find the ‘or’ spelling on **Individual Code Chart page 5** and
trace the code information in blue marker. Tell students that they are using a
blue marker instead of green because the /or/ sound has both a consonant
sound and a vowel sound. Remind students that when they see ‘or’ when
reading, they can look at the Individual Code Chart if they need help
remembering how to sound out this spelling.

After today’s lesson: If students read 1,000 words in a trade book, on average between
595 and 752 of those words would be completely decodable.


Students have now learned at least one way to write 43 of the 44 sounds in English. The
only sound that they have not learned to write is the very rare consonant sound /zh/ as
in _treasure_ .


The sound /or/ is the twenty-ninth most common sound in English and is found in
approximately 4 percent of English words.


The sound /or/ is spelled ‘or’ approximately 70 percent of the time.


The spelling alternative ‘ore’ as in _more_ will be taught later in this grade.


The spelling alternatives ‘our’ as in _four_, ‘ar’ as in _war_, ‘oor’ as in _door_, and ‘oar’ as in _soar_
will be taught in Grade 2.

  - Remind students that yesterday they learned about syllables. Ask students,
“How many vowel sounds does each syllable have?” _(one)_


  - Say the following one-syllable words. First, say the words in a segmented
fashion, emphasizing the vowel sound. Then, say the word and clap for the
one syllable: /ch/ /a/ /t/, _chat_ ; /sh/ /i/ /p/, _ship_ ; /p/ /e/ /n/, _pen_ .


  - Tell students that they also learned about compound words. Remind students
that a compound word is made up of two separate one-syllable words.


  - Say the word _catfish_ and ask students, “How many vowel sounds do you hear
in the word _catfish_ ?” Students may place their hands underneath their chins
while saying the word to detect how many vowel sounds are in _catfish_ . Clap
each syllable in _catfish_ while saying the word aloud.


  - Write the word _cat•fish_ on the board/chart paper, including the • symbol.


  - Remind students that a good way to read a two-syllable compound word is to
treat it like two one-syllable words. Students should first sound out and blend
the sounds in the first syllable, then sound out and blend the sounds in the

Foundational Skills 4


**Note:** If students can easily decode and read the individual, one-syllable
word parts of a compound word, they do not need to break each chunk down
into its sounds.


 - Write the following words on the board/chart paper for students to read
aloud using the three-step chunking method: _bath•tub_, _egg•shell_, _pop•corn_ .


 - Tell students that you are now going to say some words that are not
compound words. Ask them to listen and clap the syllables in the next set
of words you say aloud: _jump_, _jump•ing_, _skip_, _skipp•ing_, _mix_, _mix•ing_ .


 - Explain that these two-syllable words are not compound words, but are
still made up of separate parts or syllables—a root word and an ending.
Discuss briefly with students the meaning and function of _–ing_ at the end
of a root word.


 - Write _mix•ing_ on the board/chart paper. Ask students to sound out and
read the word as you point to each part. Explain that this word has a root
word, _mix_, and an ending, _–ing_ . The • between the root word _mix_ and the
ending _–ing_ shows how this two-syllable word made up of a root word and an
ending is divided into syllables. Two-syllable root words with endings divide
immediately before the ending. ~~**TEKS 1.3.C**~~


 - Write _jump•ing_ on the board/chart paper. Ask, “Which part of this twosyllable word is the root word?” _(jump)_ “What part is the ending?” _(ing)_
Have students read the word.


 - Write the following words on the board/chart paper and ask students to
read them.

**INTRODUCE TRICKY WORDS: TODAY,**
~~**TOMORROW, YESTERDAY (10 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** Students are probably already familiar with these words. At this point in
the program, it is only important that students can read these Tricky Words, not
spell them.


**Tricky Word: Today**

  - Write the Tricky Word _to • day_ on the board/chart paper and ask students
how they would pronounce it by blending if it were not a Tricky Word. _(They_
_might say something like /t/ /o/ /d/ /a/.)_

story.”


  - Circle the letters ‘t’ and ‘d’ and explain that they are pronounced as students
would expect, as /t/ and /d/.


  - Underline the letter ‘o’ and explain that this is a tricky part of the word. It is
pronounced /u/. It also can be pronounced /oo/.


  - Underline the letters ‘ay’ and explain that this is another tricky part of the
word. It is pronounced /ae/. Students will learn the spelling alternative /ae/

   - ‘ay’ later in this grade.


  - Have students write _today_ on their index card, underlining the tricky part.


**Tricky Word: Yesterday**

  - Write the Tricky Word _yes • ter • day_ on the board/chart paper.


  - Explain that this word is pronounced /y/ /e/ /s/ /t/ /er/ /d/ /ae/ as in,
“Yesterday we read a story.”


  - Circle the spellings ‘y’, ‘e’, ‘s’, ‘t’, ‘er’, and ‘d’ and explain that they are
pronounced as students would expect, as /y/, /e/, /s/, /t/, /er/, and /d/.
Most of this word is decodable.

~~**PROGRESS MONITORING (OPTIONAL)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iii**~~


**R-Controlled Vowel Word Reading**

  - Make a copy of the Word Cards for Progress Monitoring 1 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 8.2** ). Cut apart the word cards.


  - Make one copy of the Record Sheet for Progress Monitoring 1 ( **Activity Page**
**TR 8.3** ) for each student you are assessing.


  - Model with the sample item.


  - Show the cards to the student one at a time. Use the Record Sheet to record
each word as the student reads.


  - Place a check next to each word read correctly.


  - For misread words, write exactly what students say as the word is sounded
out. If students misread a word, prompt them to try to read the word again,
letting them know their first attempt was incorrect.


  - Students may benefit from the supports utilized during instruction such as
blending motions and representing sounds with objects (e.g., Push and Say).


  - Demonstrate and encourage their use during modeling with the sample item
if needed. The goal is for students to eventually be capable of completing
the tasks without physical supports or, at least, utilizing the supports
independently (without your prompt).


**Scoring:** Scoring is based on one point assigned for every r-controlled vowel
in a word that is read correctly. Interpret scores as follows:


    - 6 points—excellent


    - 5 points—good


    - 4 points—fair


    - Less than 4 points—poor


**Goal:** Achieve scores of good or excellent (5 points or higher).


Scores of 4 or less indicate additional reteaching and reinforcement is
required using either activities and activity pages from the Pausing Point.


**TEKS 1.2.B.iii** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by) decoding words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe
syllables; vowel teams, including vowel digraphs and diphthongs; and r-controlled syllables.


Lesson 8 Tricky Words: Introduce: _Today_, _Yesterday_, and _Tomorrow_
**99**


Further analyze student errors to determine whether there are one or more
particularly problematic sound/spellings. The subtotals for targeted sound
spellings at the bottom of the record sheets facilitate the identification of
specific problem areas.


Also examine whether there are mispronunciations occurring more
frequently in a given position in words. For example, does the student read
the initial sound correctly, but misread the medial and/or final sound?


Finally, examine whether the student succeeded in reading words correctly
on the second attempt. If so, the student may be rushing and may benefit
from explicit instruction to slow down and look at each letter in a word
sequentially, left to right.

~~**TWO-SYLLABLE WORDS (15 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iv**~~


  - Remind students that they have been reading words with both one and two
syllables. Ask, “How many vowel sounds does a two-syllable word have?” _(two)_


  - Remind students that they have been reading two-syllable words that are
compound words. A compound word is made up of two separate words.


  - Write the following compound words on the board/chart paper and have
students use the three-step chunking method to segment and blend the
words: _lip•stick_, _out•side_, _broom•stick_ .


  - Tell students that in the last lesson, they learned about and read two-syllable
words that are made up of a root word and an ending, like _runn•ing_ and _jump•ing_ .


  - Explain that the final consonants of some root words double when an ending
is added to the root word.


  - Say the word _melt•ing_ . Have students clap the syllables while saying _melt•ing_ .


  - Write _melt•ing_ on the board/chart paper and guide students in segmenting
and blending the word. Ask, “Which part is the root word? Which part is the
ending?” Remind students that the dot comes before the ending of the word.


  - Write _brush•ing_, _pick•ing_, _runn•ing_ on the board/chart paper and assist
students in reading the words.


  - Now, tell students that another ending that sometimes follows root words
is _–er_ . When we add – _er_ to a root word that is a verb, the new word changes
from a verb to a noun. The new word meaning also changes; ‘er’ added to a
verb that is a root word usually means “a person who [action verb].”


**TEKS 1.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (iv) using knowledge of base words to decode common compound
words and contractions; (v) decoding words with inflectional endings including -ed, -s, and -es; (i) decoding words in isolation

Call on students to clap or stomp out syllables for the following words: _breakfast_,

_eggs_, _eating_, _toast_, _brushing_, _toothpaste_, _teeth_, _lunch_, _sandwich_, _cheese_, _ketchup_,

_dinner_, _cutting_, _fork_, and _drinking_ .


~~**PRACTICE VOWEL DIGRAPHS (15 MIN.)**~~


**Dictation with Words**

  - Tell students to take out a pencil and a piece of paper. On the top of the
paper, they should write their names and the date.


  - Explain that you are going to say a number of words.


  - Tell students to write each word that you say. The words will contain the
sounds they have learned to spell thus far.


  - For each word that you say, hold up a finger for each sound.


  - Use the word _herd_ as an example word to guide students through the
dictation process. Ask students to count the sounds and then draw a line on
their paper for each sound that they hear. For example, for the word _herd_,
students would draw three lines on the paper.


  - Once students have drawn one line for each sound, remind them that the
sound /er/ is spelled with two letters that will be written on the same line.


  - Have students write the spellings on their respective lines: ‘h’ ‘er’ ‘d’.


  - Now, call out the words in the following box for dictation, holding up a finger
for each sound. You may want to prompt students when words are spelled
with separated digraphs, such as _grate_ (four sounds), _bite_ (three sounds),
and _mule_ (three), reminding them that even though they only hear the
designated numbers of sounds, the vowel sounds in these words are created
by the magic ‘e’, written as a separated digraph. For words with other vowel
teams/digraphs, remind students that they will write the spelling or vowel
team representing the sound on a single line.


  - Finally, ask students to read each word back to you.

 - Write the words on the board/chart paper and have students self-correct
their work.


**Note:** It might be useful to have students use a different colored pencil

Written Response: Dictation with Words


Collect students’ dictation papers to review and monitor student progress.


 - Use the following strategies and routines to teach and reinforce how to
alphabetize a series of words to the second letter.


 - Write these words in a line on the board: _egg, fun, drop, far, cot_ . Say, “Let’s
look at and say some words we have been learning and then list them in
alphabetical order. Remember we start by looking at the first letter. The letter
_c_ comes before the letters _d_, _e_, and _f_ in the alphabet, so I will write _cot_ first
in our list. The letter _d_ comes after _c_ and before _e_ and _f_, so the next word in
our list is _drop_ .” Ask students which word should come next in your list. _(egg)_
Say, “Yes. The letter _e_ comes after _c_ and _d_ in the alphabet, and I will write _egg_
under _drop_ .”


 - Then ask students what letter the remaining two words begin with. _(f)_ Point
out that to figure out the correct order of these words, you will have to look
at the second letter of each word. Ask students which letter comes first: _u_ or
_a. (a)_ Say, “Because _a_ comes before _u,_ we know that _far_ comes before _fun.”_
Write _far_ and _fun_ in order.


Foundational Skills 4


  - Use the index cards prepared in advance with the words: _trip, all, cold, mess,_
_top, rest, rock, tap._ Distribute them to ten students who then stand randomly
at the front of the class. Have another volunteer name which word comes
first in alphabetical order. The student with that word should move to the left
to start a line of words in alphabetical order. Continue having students name
words until all of the cards are in order.

will distinguish between common and proper nouns. ~~**TEKS 1.11.D.ii; TEKS 1.11.D.iii**~~


~~**IDENTIFY NOUNS AND VERBS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that they have learned about two parts of speech in Grade 1,
nouns and verbs. Ask, “What is a noun?” Review that a noun is a person, place,
or thing, and that a proper noun names a specific person, place, or thing. Ask
students to give you an example of a noun and a proper noun.


  - Ask, “What is a verb?” Review that a verb is a part of speech that shows
action. Ask students to give you an example of a verb.


  - Write the following sentence on the board/chart paper: “The dog runs.”


  - Ask, “What is the verb in the sentence?” Underline the verb _run_ s with a
squiggly line, telling students that the squiggly line means action, so the
word is a verb.


  - Ask, “What is the noun in the sentence?” Circle the noun.


  - Continue reviewing nouns and verbs by writing the following sentences on
the board/chart paper. Ask students to identify the noun and verb in each
sentence.



1. The clock ticks.


2. The cat sleeps.


3. The kids jump.



4. To•day the kids swim.


5. To•day the men bake.

~~**TEKS 1.2.B.v; TEKS 1.2.C.i**~~


~~**TEACHER CHAINING WITH TWO-SYLLABLE WORDS (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that they have been practicing reading two-syllable words that
are either compound words or root words with endings, like _–ing_ or _–er_ .
Today they will also practice reading two-syllable words that are neither
compound words nor root words with endings.


  - Ask students, “How many vowel sounds does each syllable have?” ( _one_ ) Tell
students that you will say two-syllable words with a different type of syllable.
Say each of the following words and ask students to repeat the word as they
simultaneously clap out each syllable: _bas•ket_ and _pic•nic_ .


  - Write the following words on the board/chart paper, and have students read
them aloud: _bas•ket, pic•nic, nap•kin, den•tist_ .


  - Point out that these words are not compound words, nor are they root words
followed by an ending. However, they are two-syllable words because there
are two distinct vowel sounds in each word. The dot that you inserted in each
word shows students where that word breaks apart into syllables and makes
it easy to sound out each part using the three-step chunking method.


  - Now tell students they will practice chaining with two-syllable words that
have a root word followed by an ending.


**TEKS 1.2.A** Demonstrate phonological awareness by (iv) recognizing the change in spoken word when a specified phoneme
is added, changed, or removed; (vi) manipulating phonemes within base words; **TEKS 1.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic

with closed syllables, open syllables, VCe syllables, vowel teams, and r- controlled syllables.


Foundational Skills 4


  - Write _fast•er_ on the board/chart paper, inserting a dot divider in between
the syllables.


  - Explain that in this case, the – _er_ ending does not mean “a person who

[action verb],” but instead it means “even more of [the action the root word
described].” For example, someone who runs faster, runs “even more fast.”


  - Tell students that you are going to change either the first syllable or the
second syllable to make a new word.


  - Remove _fast_ and add _help_ to make _help•er_ . Do not erase the dot divider.


  - As you make this change, say, “If that is _fast•er_, what is this?” Point out that
in this case, since the ending – _er_ is added to a verb, _help_, the new word,
_helper_, is a noun, meaning a person who helps.


  - Ask students whether you changed the first or second syllable.


  - Continue this process with the remaining words. After students have chained
and read _quick•er_, tell them that you are going to erase the _–er_ ending and
add a new ending, _–est_ . Continue with the remaining words in the chain.


  - Tell students that the second chain is made up of compound words. Follow
the same procedure as the first chain.


1. fast•er > help•er > bett•er > lett•er > quick•er > quick•est > fast•est


2. sun•set > sun•rise > sun•shine > sun•down


Check For Understanding


Listen to individual students orally produce the new two-syllable word from each

chaining step.

compound words and other two-syllable words, including words with
the _–er_, _–ing_, and _–ed_ endings. ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.iv; TEKS 1.2.A.vi; TEKS 1.2.B.iv;**~~

~~**TEKS 1.2.B.v; TEKS 1.2.C.i**~~


Students will recognize and write two-syllable words with /ar/ > ‘ar’, /er/ > ‘er’, and
/or/ > ‘or’. ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.i; TEKS 1.2.B.iv**~~


Students will read decodable phrases with two-syllable words and words with
/er/ > ‘er,’ /ar/ > ‘ar’, and /or/ > ‘or’. ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iii**~~


~~**ADDING, DELETING, AND SUBSTITUTING SYLLABLES (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Using a routine to help students learn to add, delete, and substitute syllables
will reinforce their oral syllable awareness.


**Adding Syllables**

  - To model adding syllables, tell students that you will practice adding syllables
in spoken compound words. If possible, project an image of a book for
students to see before you say the word _book_ aloud. Say the word _book_ and
then show an image of a bookcase.


  - Say, “The name of the object in this picture is a compound (multisyllabic)
word. That means it is made up of two words that have been pushed
together. If we start with the word _book_ and add the word _case_, we get a new
word with two syllables: _bookcase.”_


  - Have students repeat the word with you.

**Deleting Syllables**

  - Next, practice deleting syllables from a compound word.


  - Say, “Let’s practice deleting a syllable from the word _back•yard.”_


  - Clap the syllables while saying _back•yard,_ and then have students repeat after you.


  - Say, “I hear two syllables. Let’s delete the second syllable, _yard._ Now we have
the word _back.”_


**TEKS 1.2.A** Demonstrate phonological awareness by (iv) recognizing the change in spoken word when a specified phoneme
is added, changed, or removed; (vi) manipulating phonemes within base words; **TEKS 1.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic
knowledge by (iv) using knowledge of base words to decode common compound words and contractions; (v) decoding words
with inflectional endings including -ed, -s, and -es; (i) decoding words in isolation and in context by applying common letter-sound
correspondences; (iii) decoding words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including vowel digraphs
and diphthongs; and r-controlled syllables; **TEKS 1.2.C.i** Spelling words with closed syllables, open syllables, VCe syllables, vowel
teams, and r- controlled syllables.


Foundational Skills 4


**Substituting Syllables**

  - Next, practice substituting syllables.


  - Say, “Let’s practice substituting a syllable using the word _ham•bur•ger._
_Substituting_ means to replace a piece of the word with another word part.”


  - Clap the syllables while saying _ham•bur•ger,_ and then have students repeat
after you.


  - Say, “I hear three syllables. Let’s substitute the first syllable, _ham,_ with the
word _cheese._ Now we have the word _cheese•bur•ger._


**Note:** Remember to only use oral instruction for this particular lesson.


~~**TEACHER CHAINING WITH TWO-SYLLABLE WORDS (10 MIN.)**~~


~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iv**~~


  - Tell students they will practice reading two-syllable words in several
chaining exercises.


  - Tell students that the first chain has compound words. Ask, “What is a
compound word?”


  - Write _bath•room_ on the board, inserting a dot divider in between
the syllables.


  - Tell students that you are going to change either the first syllable or the
second syllable to make a new word.


  - Remove _bath_ and add _bed_ to make _bed•room_ . Do not erase the dot divider.


  - As you make this change, say, “If that is _bath•room,_ what is this?”


  - Ask students whether you changed the first or second syllable.


  - Continue this process with the remaining words.


  - When you have come to the end of the first chain, erase the board.


  - Tell students they will now chain words that have a root word and an ending.
Remind students that they have read the following endings with root words:
_–ing, –er, –est_ .


  - Discuss briefly the meanings of – _er_, and – _est_ . As an example, write _fast_ on
the board/chart paper. Explain that _fast_ means quick. Provide an example
of the word used in a sentence: “My rabbit is fast when she runs.”


  - Add _–er_ to the end of _fast_, and explain that adding this ending changes the
meaning. _Faster_ means more quickly or “more fast.” Provide an example of
the word used in a sentence: “My cat is faster than my rabbit.”


**TEKS 1.2.B.iv** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by using knowledge of base words to decode common compound
words and contractions.


Lesson 11 Spelling: Two-Syllable Words
**125**


 - Erase – _er_ and add _–est_ to the end of _fast_, and explain that adding this ending
changes the meaning. _Fastest_ mean the most quickly or “most fast.” Provide an
example of the word used in a sentence: “My dog is the fastest of all my pets.”


 - Complete the second chain using the same steps as the previous chain.


1. bath•room > bed•room > bed•time > noon•time > lunch•time > lunch•box


2. butt•er > bigg•er > rubb•er > ladd•er > dinn•er > hamm•er > buzz•er > buzz•ing >

In Spanish, there is no _–ed_
to indicate past tense. You
may wish to explain that
in English, when we want
to say that someone did
something in the past, we
add _–ed_ to the end of the
verb. The way we say _–ed_
depends on what kind of
sound comes before it.


~~**ELPS 2.C**~~


**128**



~~**IDENTIFY PRESENT- AND PAST-TENSE VERBS (10 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** Please note that this is a listening exercise, so students should not be
asked to read or spell the words.


 - Ask students to listen to the following sentence, calling attention to the verb:
“Today I walk to school.” You may choose to have students mime the action
by walking in place.


 - Ask students what action is described in the sentence. _(walk)_


 - Tell students that _walk_ is a word that describes an action and is, therefore,
a verb. Ask students whether the verb _walk_ describes an action that is
happening right now in the present or whether it describes an action that has
already happened. Repeat the sentence and point out the cue provided by
the word _today_ as one way that you know the action is in the present.


 - Ask students to listen to the following sentence, calling attention to the verb:
“Yesterday I walked to school.”


 - Ask students what action was performed yesterday? _(walked)_


 - Tell students that _walked_ is a word that describes an action and is a verb.
Ask students whether the verb _walked_ describes an action that is happening
right now in the present or whether it describes an action that has already
happened in the past. Repeat the sentence and point out the cues provided
by the extra /t/ sound that is heard at the end of the word _walked,_ as well as
the use of the word _yesterday._


 - Repeat this process with the following sentences, asking students to identify
the verb in each one.


 - Point out that in each sentence pair, the first sentence contains a verb that
describes an action that is taking place today in the present, meaning right
now, and the second sentence contains a verb that describes an action that
has already taken place in the past.


1. Today I slip in the mud. Yesterday I slipped in the mud.


2. Today I zip up a zipper. Yesterday I zipped up a zipper.


3. Today I lift my arm. Yesterday I lifted my arm.

~~**INTRODUCE SPELLING WORDS (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Write the following headers on the board/chart paper: /ar/ > ‘ar’, /er/ > ‘er’,
and /or/ > ‘or’.


 - Read and write each spelling word, underlining and reviewing the vowel team
in each word. Have students repeat each word after you. Make sure students
notice that all of these words are two-syllable words; they may find these
words a greater challenge to practice and write than the one-syllable words
that have been included on earlier spelling assessments.


 - Point out that you are writing these two-syllable words with a dot to assist
students in chunking the word into syllables when they read it. They may find it
helpful to practice writing and remembering the spelling words syllable by syllable.
However, tell students that on the assessment, you will ask them to try to write
the word without including the dot. Students will not be penalized on this spelling
assessment, however, if they inadvertently include the dot when writing the word.


 - Remind students that the last word is a Tricky Word and that Tricky Words do
not follow the rules, so their spellings must be memorized.


 - Ask one or more students to use each word in a sentence, making sure to explain
vocabulary for any words they may not know. The words for the week are:

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


This information is provided for your knowledge. You may choose to share it
with students as questions arise. The focus for students in this unit is to read
words with _–ed_ and spell words from the spelling list. For now, students are
not expected to make _–ed_ spelling generalizations. There will be additional
practice in subsequent units. Today you will teach past-, present-, and
future-tense verbs. In English, the past tense of a verb is frequently marked
by adding the letters ‘ed’ to the end of the root word. The letters ‘ed’ can be
pronounced three different ways: /ed/ as in _started_, /d/ as in _hugged_, or
/t/ as in _asked_ . The pronunciation of the ending is determined by the sound
that precedes it—that is, by the last sound in the root word to which the ‘ed’
ending is added. After voiced consonant sounds (/b/, /g/, /v/, /th/, /z/,
/zh/, /j/, /n/, /m/, /ng/, /l/, /r/) and after vowel sounds (all of which are
voiced), the – _ed_ ending is pronounced as a voiced /d/ as in _hugged_, _called_,
and _sighed_ . After voiceless consonant sounds (/p/, /k/, /f/, /th/, /s/, /sh/,
/ch/), the _–ed_ is pronounced as a voiceless /t/ as in _asked_ or _fished_ . After
the sounds /t/ and /d/, the _–ed_ is pronounced /ed/ as in _started_ and _added_ .
This is the pronunciation that you would expect based on the spelling ‘ed’,
but it is actually a good deal less common than the other pronunciations.


It is the sound that precedes the past-tense marker that determines its
pronunciation, not the spelling. This information may prove most useful to
students for whom English is a second language. Native English speakers
generally have little difficulty in reading and correctly pronouncing the _–ed_
ending. This is partly because students have heard many past-tense verbs
in oral speech. Their mouths will also tend to guide them to the correct
pronunciation. It is much easier to say _rinsed_ with a /t/ at the end than to
say it with a /d/ at the end. The mouth resists the shift from voiceless to
voiced that is required to say /r/ /i/ /n/ /s/ /d/.


When the root form of the verb already ends with an ‘e’, we do not add a
second ‘e’.


_smile_  - _smiled_ (not _smileed_ )


_bake_  - _baked_ (not _bakeed_ )


_skate > skated_ (not _skateed_ )


Lesson 13 Grammar: Past-, Present-, and Future-Tense Verbs
**143**


There is a certain ambiguity in words like _smiled_ and _baked_ . It is not
completely clear what role the ‘e’ is playing in words like these. It could
be any of the following:


the ‘e’ is part of the spelling for the vowel sound ( _sm_ i _l_ e _d_ );


the ‘e’ is part of the _–ed_ ending ( _smil_ ed), or


the ‘e’ is doing two “jobs”; it is part of the spelling for the vowel sound and
part of the past-tense ending _–ed_ ( _sm_ i _l_ **e** d).


The best approach with students is to say that the ‘e’ is doing two jobs. That
is the strategy we recommend in these materials. In the Reader for this unit
the last two letters in words like _smiled_ are bolded to show that the ‘e’ is
part of the _–ed_ ending, but you are encouraged to tell students that the ‘e’
is also part of the spelling for the vowel sound. Note that words that have a
final ‘e’ in the root word behave just like words that end in other letters. The
past-tense ending is pronounced voiced /d/ when it is attached to a root
word that ends in a voiced sound (e.g., _blamed, fined_ ), voiceless /t/ when
it is attached to a root word that ends in a voiceless sound (e.g., _baked,_
_escaped_ ), and /ed/ when it follows /d/ or /t/ (e.g., _skated, noted_ ). This can
be distinguished from those words whose final consonant is doubled before
adding _–ed_, such as _hugged, potted_, etc. The consonant doubling serves as
a pronunciation trigger for the reader, highlighting that the vowel sound in
these words is “short.” Thus, confusion with words that have a final ‘e’ in the
root word is eliminated.


Although these guidelines may sound confusing, most students are able
to master the pronunciation of past-tense endings fairly rapidly, without
learning any pronunciation rules.

~~**PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE (5 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** In the grammar exercises for Unit 3 and in the Warm-Ups for Unit 4, students
have been working with verbs and their tenses. Today you will introduce the word
_tense_ and explain that verb tenses identify the time of an event.


  - In discussing past, present, and future, connect the past to the word
_yesterday_, the present to the word _today_, and the future to the word
_tomorrow_ . On a calendar, point to today’s date, yesterday’s date, and
tomorrow’s date.


  - Ask students to tell you some things that happened to them yesterday at school.


  - Explain that things that have already happened—whether yesterday or a long
time ago—are in the past.


  - Ask students to tell you some things that are happening today, right now.


  - Explain that things that are happening right now are in the present—at least
for a split second, until they slip into the past!


  - Ask students to tell you some things that might happen tomorrow at school.


  - Explain that things that will happen, or may happen—either tomorrow
or later—are in the future. You may wish to point out that it is harder to
accurately say what will happen in the future than it is to say what has
already happened.

~~**VERB TENSE PRACTICE (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that every sentence has a verb. The verb is the action word
part of the sentence that tells us what is happening now, what has already
happened, or what will happen in the future.


 - Explain that when we change the time when what is described in the
sentence happens, we are changing the tense of the verb and of the sentence
as a whole.


 - Show students how you can change a sentence from the present tense to the
past or future tense by changing the verb. Say, “Today we learn about verbs.”
Then change it to the past: “Yesterday we learned about verbs.” Then change
it to the future: “Tomorrow we will learn about verbs.”


 - Explain that “Today we learn about verbs” is in the present tense; “Yesterday
we learned about verbs” is in the past tense; “Tomorrow we will learn about
verbs” is in the future tense.


 - Tell students that you would like them to practice changing sentences into
different tenses.


 - Read the first sentence and ask a student to change it into the past tense.
Ask a second student to change the sentence into the future tense.


 - Work through the remaining sentences, noting that this is an oral exercise.


**Note:** Point out that the words _yesterday, today,_ and _tomorrow_ signal the

~~**PAST-TENSE MARKER –ED (20 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.v; TEKS 1.3.C**~~


  - Tell students that when we want to describe things that happened in the past,
we need to put the verb in the past tense. This is usually done by adding the
letters ‘ed’ to the end of the verb.


  - Explain that these letters are pronounced differently depending on the
sounds that come before them.


  - Distribute Activity Page 13.1.


  - Remind students that letters in slashes stand for sounds. Point out that on
the line beneath the box, “/ed/” stands for /ed/ as in _started_, “/d/” stands for
/d/ as in _grinned_, and “/t/” stands for /t/ as in _helped_ .


  - As a class, read through the verbs in the box, asking students to underline
the past-tense marker _–ed_ in each verb.

 - As students refer to the activity page, explain that sometimes we pronounce
the letters ‘ed’ the way the students would expect—as /ed/. Now, write the
word _started_ in the top left-hand column of the displayed chart. Read the

word _grinned_ in the top middle column of the chart. Read the word and use it
in a sentence.


 - Have students trace the word _grinned_ on their activity pages.


 - Explain that in other cases, we pronounce the letters ‘ed’ as /t/. Write the
word _helped_ on the board/chart paper in the top right-hand column of the
chart. Read the word and use it in a sentence.


**Note:** It is difficult and sounds odd to pronounce /d/ after sounds where /t/
is the regular pronunciation, and vice versa.


 - Have students trace the word _helped_ on their activity pages.


 - Go through the remaining past-tense verbs from Activity Page 13.1; use each
word in a sentence and ask students where it should be added to the chart.


 - Add the verbs to the chart and have students write the words on their
activity pages.


 - When you come to the word _smiled_, write _smile_ on the board/chart paper.
Point out that it ends with an ‘e’. Explain that we do not need to add another
‘e’ to change it to the past tense. (If we did, it might look like the ‘ee’ spelling
for the /ee/ sound—’ileed’.) Add a ‘d’ to make the past tense, _smiled_ . Read
the word, use it in a sentence, and add it to the proper column.


Foundational Skills 4


 - When you come to the word _baked_, write _bake_ on the board/chart paper.
Point out that it also ends with an ‘e’. Explain that we do not need to add
another ‘e’ to change this to the past tense. (If we did, it might look like the
‘ee’ spelling for the /ee/ sound _—’_ akeed.’) Add a ‘d’ to make the past tense,
baked. Read the word, use it in a sentence, and add it to the proper column.


 - Tell students that in words like _smiled_ and _baked_ the letter ‘e’ has two jobs.
It is part of ‘ed’ for the past tense and, at the same time, it works together
with the preceding vowel letter to stand for a separated digraph.


 - Repeat for the words _waved_ and _hiked_ .

For students who are
struggling with hearing the
syllables in two-syllable
words, keep practicing
with compound words.


**158**



**Primary Focus**


Students will identify the number of syllables in oral words and then use
knowledge of base words to decode common compound words and two-syllable
words that include inflected endings _–ing_ and _–er_ . ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iv; TEKS 1.2.B.v**~~


Students will identify the total number of sounds and syllables in written words
with vowel digraphs, including /er/ > ‘er’, /or/ > ‘or’, and /ar/ > ‘ar’. ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iv**~~


Students will read decodable phrases with two-syllable words and spell words with
vowel digraphs, including /er/ > ‘er’, /ar/ > ‘ar’, and /or/ > ‘or’. ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iv; TEKS 1.2.C.i**~~


~~**CLAP AND READ TWO-SYLLABLE WORDS (15 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iv**~~


  - Remind students that they have been learning about two-syllable words.


  - Ask, “What do we call two-syllable words that are made up of two separate
words?” _(compound words)_ Have students provide you with three examples
of compound words, and clap the syllables together as a class. Then write the
words on the board/chart paper, using a dot to indicate where the break in
syllables occurs.


  - Ask, “Who can give me examples of another type of two-syllable word that is
made up of a root word followed by an ending?” Have students provide you
with three examples of root words + ending, and clap the syllables together
as a class. Then write the words on the board/chart paper, using a dot to
indicate where the break in syllables occurs.


  - Remind students that other two-syllable words may not include compound
words or root words with endings; they have two syllables because there
are two vowel sounds (i.e., one in each syllable) and each syllable ends in a
consonant. Write the word _den•tist_ on the board/chart paper. Guide students
in sounding out each part and then reading the complete word. Point out the
spelling for each vowel sound (/e/ > ‘e’ and /i/ > ‘i’). Also point out that each
of these syllables ends in a consonant (‘n’ at the end of the first syllable and
‘t’ at the end of the second syllable).


  - Tell students that they will now read some more two-syllable words. Write
the following words on the board/chart paper, including the dot between
syllables. Remind students that the dot shows us where the syllables are
divided, but they are not to use dots in their own writing.


**TEKS 1.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (iv) using knowledge of base words to decode common compound
words and contractions; (v) decoding words with inflectional endings including -ed, -s, and -es; **TEKS 1.2.C.i** Demonstrate and
apply spelling knowledge by spelling words with closed syllables, open syllables, VCe syllables, vowel teams, and r-controlled
syllables.

Foundational Skills 4


- For each two-syllable word, ask students to identify whether it is a
compound word, a root word + ending, or a two-syllable word where each
syllable ends in a consonant.


- Students can use the three-step method for reading and writing the words.









Check for Understanding


Distribute ten blank index cards to each student. Have students copy/print the words

in the previous box onto index cards. Then ask them to sort the words into three

piles; root word + ending, compound word, and two-syllable word where each syllable

ends in a consonant.


~~**MIXED PRACTICE (20 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.2.B.iv**~~


  - Distribute Activity Pages 14.1 and 14.2. Remind students to write the date
below their names.


  - On Activity Page 14.1, students should circle the sounds in each word, then
write the number of how many sounds there are, then copy the word.


  - Activity Page 14.2 has a list of questions. Students should read the question
and answer with either _yes_ or _no_ .


  - Have students complete the activity page with a partner.


  - After students complete the Activity Pages, explain that you are going to
dictate some new multisyllabic words for them to spell on their own paper.
Provide words with r-controlled vowels and closed syllables, such as _kitten,_
_comet, pencil, dentist, hundred, butter, artist, person, turkey,_ and _morning._

characteristics (e.g., colors, shapes, textures, some that make a sound, etc.).
Place them in a box.

**Primary Focus**


Students will understand that adjectives are words used to describe nouns.


~~**TEKS 1.11.D.iv**~~



35M



Students will identify nouns and verbs in written sentences and will orally produce
adjectives to describe the nouns. ~~**TEKS 1.11.D.ii; TEKS 1.11.D.iii**~~


~~**USE ADJECTIVES (15 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** Feel free to use the term _adjective_ when talking about descriptive
words with students. However, please remember that, in Grade 1, the focus
is having students use adjectives to describe nouns and less on having them
formally identify these words as the part of speech known as adjectives.


  - Tell students that today they will practice describing objects using their five
senses. Review each of the five senses, having students identify the body
part that is responsible for each sense. _(Eyes help you see; ears help you hear;_
_tongue helps you taste; fingers help you touch; nose helps you smell.)_ Refer
students to the Five Senses chart you created in advance.

 - Choose four to six items from the box of objects that you prepared prior
to this lesson and display them. Explain that you will describe one of the
objects, one clue at a time, and that you want students to guess which
object it is.


 - Model how to follow the Five Senses chart to create clues about the object,
using as many adjectives as possible. Stop after each clue and have students
repeat the clue that you gave. Then ask a student to guess the object. Ask
the other students if it could be another object, but do not tell them yet if the
answer is right or wrong.


 - See the example of a possible chart that you might complete if the object
being described were a piece of watermelon-flavored hard candy. In choosing
and writing the descriptive words, consciously attempt to use and write
words that are decodable. If you use words that include sound/spellings
students have not yet learned, point out that they are Tricky Words.


 - Continue until students correctly guess the object.


 - Point out that you described different aspects of the object, using as many of
your senses as possible. Ask students which senses you used.


 - Point out that you used a lot of describing words, or adjectives, to talk about
the object. Remind students that adjectives are words used to describe
nouns. Ask students which describing words, or adjectives, you used in
conjunction with the noun/object described (e.g., round candy, red candy,
candy that has a crunching sound when you bite it).


 - Summarize by telling students that a description tells in detail how
something or someone appears to the senses (i.e., how it looks, smells,
tastes, sounds, or feels). By using adjectives when you talk and/or write,
you can provide a vivid, interesting description for other people.


 - If you have extra time, repeat this procedure one or more times with a
different object from the box each time.


Check for Understanding


Observe students’ oral responses to make sure they understand that adjectives

describe nouns.

that describe when an action is happening, already happened, or will happen:
present, past, and future. Examples of all three verb tenses are included in
the sentences on this activity page.


 - Tell students that on this activity page, they should circle the nouns and
underline the verbs with a squiggly line in each sentence.


 - Complete the first two sentences together as a class. Then have students
complete the activity page with a partner.


 - Circulate around the room as students complete the activity page.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


Note to Teacher


Knowledge of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and verb tense is a necessary
foundational skill for reading and spelling in Grade 1. However, grammar
skills will continue to develop as students progress with the Grade 1 scope
and sequence. Lingering challenges with grammar should be addressed,
but should not hold a student back from advancing to Unit 5 if the student
is otherwise prepared. Therefore, specific performance standards are not
designated; a sample system for collecting progress monitoring data is
provided instead.


Individual records should be kept for students in need of
grammar remediation.


Refer to the Grammar Progress Monitoring Record located in the Teacher
Resources section.


Fill in the “Grammar Skill” column with the grammar targets for assessment:


 - Nouns


 - Contractions (introduction to apostrophe taking the place of letters)


 - Verb tense


 - Adjectives


Record the date of observation (top) and an overall ranking of how the
student performed with the skill that day (bottom):


**NY:** Not Yet


**P:** Progressing


**R:** Ready

A more formal assessment may be completed with students one-on-one.
Often instructional tasks or activity pages can be adjusted from a learning
tool to an assessment tool by simply having the student complete a handful
of items without assistance. Under “Progress Monitoring,” record the date of
assessment and the performance score (e.g., ¾ or 75%) with the skill that day.


 - Collect a few small objects that students can describe to practice adjectives.
Choose interesting objects with colors and/or textures and some that make
a sound. Place them in a box. You will also need a puppet or stuffed animal.

**Primary Focus**


Students will read and spell two-syllable words with the suffixes –er, –ness, and
–less. ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.iv; TEKS 1.2.B.v; TEKS 1.2.C.i**~~


Students will read and write single-syllable words with /er/ > ‘er’, /ar/ > ‘ar’, and
/or/ > ‘or’. ~~**TEKS 1.2.A.iv; TEKS 1.2.A.vi; TEKS 1.2.B.iii; TEKS 1.2.C.i**~~


~~**TEACHER CHAINING (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that they have learned about two-syllable words that are
made up of a root word and an ending. Today they will see two new endings
added to root words, –ness and –less.


  - Remind students that they have already encountered a root word with
the ending –less in the chapter, “The Reptile Room.” Ask students if they
remember the word. (harmless) Write the word harmless on the board/chart
paper. Identify harm as the root word and –less as the ending. Ask if students
remember the meaning of the ending –less. (without) Point out that when
–less is added to a noun, it changes the part of speech of the new word to
an adjective.


  - Now write the word sad on the board, pointing out that sad is an adjective.
Add the ending –ness to sad with a dot between the syllables, and ask
students to read the new word. Point out that the new word sadness is a
noun. Explain that the ending –ness means “full of” (e.g., sadness is to be
full of sad).


  - Now write thick•er on the board, inserting a dot divider in between the
syllables.


  - Ask students to sound out the word using the three-step method.


  - Tell students that you are going to change either the first syllable or the
second syllable to make a new word.


  - Remove –er and add –ness to make thick•ness. Do not erase the dot divider.


  - As you make this change, say, “If that is thick•er, what is this?”


  - Ask students whether you changed the first or second syllable.


**TEKS 1.2.A** Demonstrate phonological awareness by (iv) recognizing the change in spoken word when a specified phoneme
is added, changed, or removed; (vi) manipulating phonemes within base words; **TEKS 1.2.B** Demonstrate and apply phonetic

 - Continue this process with the remaining words.


 - When you have come to the end of the first chain, erase the board and begin
the next chain.


1. thick•er > thick•ness > ill•ness > dark•ness > like•ness


2. count•less > tooth•less > care•less > name•less > name•tag


Check for Understanding


Observe students’ oral responses to make sure they understand chaining root words

with the –er, –ness, and –less endings.


~~**LARGE CARD CHAINING (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Pass out the following Large Letter Cards, reviewing each card’s sound as
you pass it out: ‘m’, ‘n’, ‘t’, ‘d’, ‘c’, ‘k’, ‘s’, ‘p’, ‘b’, ‘l’, ‘h’, ‘ch’, ‘sh’, ‘ar’, ‘or’, and ‘er’.


 - Tell students that if they are holding a card with a picture of a sound that is
in her, they should go to the front of the room and stand in the order that
spells her.


 - If necessary, guide students in getting in the correct order.


 - Once students are standing in place, ask the class if the word looks right.


 - Once the word has been spelled correctly, say, “If that is her, show me herd.”


 - Students should rearrange themselves to make the new word.


 - Continue this process until all of the words in the first chain have been spelled.


 - Have students trade cards and proceed to the next chain.


1. her > herd > hard > harsh > marsh > march > parch > perch > perk > pork


2. harm > harp > sharp > shark > sharks > parks > sparks > larks > dark > stark

~~**IDENTIFY PRESENT-, PAST-, AND FUTURE-TENSE VERBS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask, “What is a verb?” (part of speech or word that shows action)


  - Remind students that they have learned about verbs that show something
is happening at that moment; these are called present-tense verbs. Ask
students to listen to the following sentence, calling attention to the presenttense verb: “Today I shiver in the wind.”


  - Have students pretend to shiver in the wind.


  - Ask students what action they performed. (shiver)


  - They have also learned about verbs that show something has happened in
the past; these are called past-tense verbs and usually have an extra
/ed/, /t/, or /d/ sound at the end of the verb. Ask students to listen to the
following sentence, calling attention to the past-tense verb: “Yesterday, I
shivered in the wind.”


  - Now tell students that verbs can also be used in sentences that tell about
something that is going to happen in the future.


  - Ask students to listen to the following sentence, telling them to listen for the
future-tense verb: “Tomorrow I will shiver in the wind.”


  - Ask students what action will happen tomorrow or in the future. (will shiver)

- Remind students that shiver is an action and the addition of the word will
signals that the action will happen in the future. Also, point out that, like the
words today and yesterday, the word tomorrow provides another cue about
the tense of the verb.


- Repeat this process with the following sentences, asking students to identify
the verb and verb tense in each one.


- Be sure to point out that in each sentence pair, the first sentence contains a
present-tense verb and the second sentence contains a future-tense verb.

 - Explain that the puppet (or stuffed animal) has not had much practice in
giving descriptions. Tell students that they might have to help it come up
with a good description of this object by referring to the Five Senses chart.


 - Have the puppet describe the object, making obvious errors such as using
only one sense to describe the object, not using many adjectives, leaving out
the most important information, etc.


 - Ask students to tell you whether they thought that the puppet’s description
was good and if it might be improved.


 - Guide students so they help the puppet create a better description,
prompting them to use adjectives that describe how the object looks,
feels, or sounds.

You may want to encourage
students to practice reading
the chapter several times
normally to build fluency
before using a silly voice.




  - Ask students to count the sounds and then draw a line on their paper for
each sound that they hear. For example, for the word _cooked_, four lines would
be drawn on the paper: .


  - Once students have drawn one line for each sound, remind them that the ‘ed’
spelling is written on one line.

 - Explain that this chart shows three steps that good writers use when they
write. Remind them that authors of their favorite books use these steps to
help create their stories.


 - Point to the plan step on the chart. Ask students what the person in the
picture is doing. ( _thinking_ )


 - Remind students that before you begin writing, you have to think about the
topic you want to write about and brainstorm, or come up with, ideas. This is
called planning.


 - Point to the draft step on the chart. Ask students what this is a picture of.
( _paper and pencil_ )


 - Remind students that the next part of the writing process is to start
organizing and writing down your ideas on paper in complete sentences.
This is called drafting, or writing a draft.


 - Point to the edit step on the chart. Ask students what this is a picture of.
( _paper and eraser_ )


 - Remind students that the last part of the process is to reread the draft, fix
any mistakes, and/or think of better ways to say and write your ideas. This is
called editing.


**Plan a Descriptive Paragraph**

 - Tell students that they are going to write descriptions and remind them that
the first step in writing a description is to plan the description—to think and
talk about how something or someone appears to the senses (i.e., how it
looks, smells, tastes, sounds, and/or feels).


 - Take out the grapes and give one to each student.


 - Remind students that they have used The Five Senses chart to help them
describe objects in previous lessons, as they were learning about adjectives.
Many of the words used in descriptive writing are adjectives.


 - Display The Five Senses planning template that you prepared in advance.
Explain that now they will plan how to describe the grapes using as many of
their senses as possible.

  - Explain that when working on a description, they should begin by writing
down the name of what they are describing (i.e., the title).


  - Point to the line at the top of the chart, and tell students that this is where to
write the title. Write _Grapes_ on the title line at the top.


  - Remind students that the five pictures on the chart represent the five senses
(sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch). Explain that it helps to use their five
senses when they want to describe something. Using the different senses
to describe a person, place, or thing will make their descriptions clearer and
more interesting to read.


  - Ask students to think about what grapes look like. Ask them to brainstorm
words and/or phrases that describe how grapes look. Remind students to be
as detailed as possible and to use adjectives.


  - Explain that many times good writers take brief notes while they are
planning. They do not write in complete sentences but just write a word or
phrase to help them remember.


  - Write the descriptive words and/or phrases that students call out on the
chart. For examples of decodable words and phrases, see an example of a
completed template above.


  - Repeat the procedure with the remaining senses.


Lesson 20 Assessment and Writing: Spelling Assessment and Plan a Descriptive Paragraph
**221**


**222**




  - You can choose to cross out the icon for smell because this sense is not really
applicable to grapes. Explain that it is not always possible or safe to use every
sense when describing something.


  - After you have talked about and described grapes orally, sum up by telling
students that they just finished the planning step of the writing process for a
description. Good writers plan—think and talk and sometimes take notes—to
help organize their ideas.


  - Tell students that in the next lesson they will draft a description of the grapes
as a class. Drafting is the second step in the writing process.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to partner with a classmate and repeat the previous activity with a different

decodable food (chip, lime, etc.) to make certain they understand descriptive adjectives.

Be sure to recommend foods that students have already eaten, as they will not be

consuming more food in this activity.

**Digital Component 20.2**



**234**




  - Point to the completed Five Senses planning template, and remind students
that in the previous lesson they discussed how to best describe grapes or
whatever you chose to describe. This was the planning step in which they
thought and talked about how grapes look, sound, taste, and feel.


  - Quickly review with students how they described the grapes, using the
completed planning template.


**Draft a Descriptive Paragraph**

  - Explain that you will now work as a class to turn what students planned
yesterday into a draft that describes grapes. They will then write a draft
on their own. Remind students that drafting is the next step in the
writing process.


  - On a new piece of chart paper, write _Grapes_ centered at the top and explain
that this is where the name of the thing you are describing, or the title, goes.
This is also the title on the completed planning template. Point out that the
first letter in the word is capitalized. Tell students that this title is just one
word but some titles are longer.


  - Explain that a good description has a beginning sentence, middle sentences,
and an ending sentence. Tell students that this is similar to the narratives
they retold in Unit 3, in which they retold a story.


  - Explain the parts of a descriptive draft: the name of the thing you are
describing (or title), the starting sentence, the descriptive sentences
(using the five senses), and the ending sentence.


  - After writing a title, students need to write a starting sentence that tells
what they are describing. The starting sentence for a descriptive paragraph
might begin, “I will describe . . .” Discuss the two-syllable word _des•cribe_
with students. ~~**TEKS 1.11.B.ii**~~


  - Tell students to finish the starting sentence with the name of the object they
are describing. For example: ”I will des•cribe grapes.”


  - Explain that the first sentence in a paragraph is always indented.
Demonstrate how to indent relative to the margin. Remind students that a
sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a punctuation mark.


**TEKS 1.11.B.ii** Develop drafts in oral, pictorial, or written form by developing an idea with specific and relevant details.


Foundational Skills 4


- Explain that in a paragraph, rather than writing each sentence on a new line,
all of the sentences follow one another like the sentences in the paragraphs
they see in their Readers.


- Tell students that the next sentences are the descriptive sentences. They
describe in detail what the grapes look, sound, taste, feel, and smell like.
Model how students can describe the grapes, using the completed planning
chart to draft these sentences.



)



**Digital Components 21.3, 21.4**




  - Model for students how to refer to the Tricky Word Wall as needed while
drafting. Explain and model how to refer to the decodable describing words
chart you prepared in advance.


  - Point to the planning template and ask students what grapes look like.
Encourage them to use the sentence starter, “Grapes look . . .” using words
from their planning template and the decodable descriptive word chart. For
example, “Grapes look round and green.” Record their description on the
chart paper.


  - Continue with the remaining senses, using the decodable sentence starters
and descriptive words from the chart. The descriptions should have the
words from the planning charts. For example, “Grapes make a popping
sound when you bite them.” “Grapes taste sweet.” “Grapes feel smooth.”


  - Remind students that it is not always necessary or possible to use all of the
five senses to describe something. In the case of grapes, students may omit
describing their smell.


  - Explain that you now need the last sentence, or ending sentence, of the
description. The ending sentence lets the reader know that you are finished
with the description.


  - Tell students that a good ending sentence mentions the person, thing, or place
that they described, but does not necessarily introduce any new information.
A good ending sentence can also be more personal; it might tell how you feel
about the person, thing, or place you described. For example, “I like grapes!”
Or, “I munch on grapes all of the time.” Or, “Grapes are good snacks for kids.”


  - Summarize by saying that in a descriptive paragraph, the descriptive
sentences and the starting and ending sentences are not written on
individual lines in a list like they are on the draft template. They are written as
a paragraph with the sentences running together and spilling from one line to
the next. Point out that the first sentence in the paragraph is indented.


Lesson 21 Writing: Draft a Descriptive Paragraph
**235**


Distribute paper and tell students that they will write their own draft about
grapes. Encourage them to look at the class draft for help, but not to directly
copy what they see.



**236**




              - Remind students that as they think about writing sentences that describe the
grapes, they may find it helpful to refer to the Tricky Word Wall. Tell them that
they can also refer to the decodable describing words chart.


               - When students have finished, distribute Activity Page 21.2, the editing
checklist. Read and review this checklist with students, reminding them that
this is used to help edit their work. Tell them to take home their draft and
the editing checklist. With a family member, they should revise their draft to
include more details or rearrange ideas and bring it back to class for the next
lesson. ~~**TEKS 1.11.C**~~

**Dictation with Past-Tense Verbs**

               - Tell students to take out a pencil and a piece of paper.


              - Explain that you are going to say a number of past-tense verbs. Each word
ends with the past-tense ending _–ed_ . Remind students that it can stand for
the /t/ sound as in _asked_, for the /d/ sound as in _filled_, or the /ed/ sound as
in _sounded_ .


               - Have students write the spelling ‘ed’ at the top of their paper.


               - Tell students to write each word that you say.


**TEKS 1.11.C** Revise drafts by adding details in pictures or words.


Foundational Skills 4


 - For each word that you say, hold up one finger for each sound.


 - Ask students to count the sounds and then draw a line on their paper for
each sound that they hear. For example, for the word _cooked_, four lines would
be drawn on the paper: .


 - Once students have drawn one line for each sound, remind them that the ‘ed’
spelling is written on one line.


 - Have students write the spellings on their respective lines: c oo k ed.


 - Finally, ask students to read the word back to you.


 - Write the words on the board/chart paper, and have students self-correct.


 - Instruct students to refer to the Individual Code Chart if they are having
difficulty remembering how to write the spellings.

 - Remind students that they have been learning many facts about the animals
at the Green Fern Zoo. _The Green Fern Zoo_ provides information about these
animals, so the Reader chapters are called informational text. Informational
text provides factual, or real, information about a topic. The facts are not
made up, or fiction. Tell students to ask questions about information in the
text that they want to learn about. Display and briefly discuss the Critters
Five Senses chart that the class created to describe several animals from
Green Fern Zoo. Tell students that they will develop and follow a research plan

  - Tell students to turn to the appropriate story using the table of contents.
Students should reread the information about their animal independently
or in small groups (based upon assigned animals).


  - After students have reread information about their animal, they will record
information about their animal on the lines below the photo on the activity

the plan and place it into complete sentences for the first draft.



)



**Digital Component 23.2**




  - On the blank drafting template you prepared prior to the lesson or the digital
version, write the word _Trout_ centered at the top and explain that this is
where the name of the animal you are describing, or the title, goes. Point out
that the first letter in the word is capitalized. Tell students that this title is just
one word, but some titles are longer.


  - Remind students that a good description has a beginning sentence, middle
descriptive sentences, and an ending sentence.


  - Explain that you will start with a sentence that tells what you are describing.
The starting sentence for a descriptive paragraph might begin, “I will
des•cribe . . .” You will finish the starting sentence with the name of the object
you are describing. For example: _I will des•cribe trout_ . Remind students that
the pronoun _I_ is always capitalized, regardless of where it appears.


  - Explain that the first sentence in a paragraph is always indented.
Demonstrate how to indent relative to the margin. Remind students that
a sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a punctuation mark.

 - Explain that the next sentences are the middle sentences. They describe in
detail what the animal is like, using the five senses. Remind students that
not all senses will be usable. Tell students to look at the completed planning
template on the trout to help draft these sentences. For example, under
“Describe what it looks like, sounds like, and feels like,” you might write:
_The trout is a fish with fins and dark marks on it. The scales of a trout feel_
_smooth and wet._


 - The middle sentences continue with where the animal makes its home and
the food it likes. For example: _The home of the trout is in cool creeks and_
_lakes. Trout munch on wee fish, shrimp, and eels for food._


 - Depending on the amount of information, the fun fact can either be the
ending sentence or the last of the middle sentences. For example: _Trout are_
_cool because they have marks that help them hide from bigger fish. I hope I_
_can see a trout soon!_


**Student Draft**

 - Next, have students use their completed planning activity pages from the
previous lesson to fill out their drafting templates in complete sentences on
Activity Page 23.1.




 - Remind students that they can use the information in the Reader in their
paragraphs. Encourage students to use the Individual Code Chart, the
Tricky Word Wall, and the descriptive words chart when writing.


 - Save students’ drafting activity pages for use in the next lesson.

  - Divide the class into two teams, having one team at a time line up in front
of the baseball diamond drawing you prepared in advance. (You may
choose to have students stay seated and divide the class into teams by
the manner in which they are seated.) Each team takes a “turn at bat.”


  - Set a timer for 10 minutes and tell students that whichever team has
the most runs when the timer rings is the winning team. Point out that
accuracy is important, so they have to be careful reading the words. At the
same time, speed is important as well, so they must pay close attention.
The more turns each team member has to read words, the more likely
their team is to score runs.


  - Show a word card and ask the first person on the team to read it aloud.
If the word is read correctly, draw a line from home plate to first base,
signifying a “hit.” This player then goes to the back of the team’s line,
while the next player comes forward to read the next card. If the word is
correctly read, draw a line from first to second base. Play continues this
way. If the fourth player reads the word correctly, draw a line from third
base to home plate and mark “1 run” for the team. Play continues for the
team so long as no words are misread; when a word is misread, the next
team takes its turn at bat.

  - Tell students you will read sentences aloud to them. They should listen carefully
and then tell you whether the action occurred in the past, present, or future.


  - If time permits, ask students to change the tense of each sentence. For
example, if you read the sentence, _I walked_, students can change it to _I will_
_walk_ or _I walk._ Remind students that _I_ should always be capitalized.

Note to Teacher


For the next three days, you will be administering the mid-year assessment.
Students will first read a story and answer comprehension questions, then
work one-on-one with you to read words in order to identify specific lettersound correspondences that require targeted remediation. Instructions are
provided as to how to progress with students based on their scores. When
working one-on-one with students, you will need to have activities prepared
for the rest of your class to work on independently. You may choose to have
students work on the following:


1. Reread stories from _The Green Fern Zoo_ Reader.


2. Read Pausing Point stories from _The Green Fern Zoo_ Reader.


3. Look at web resources/informational video clips on animals found at the
Green Fern Zoo.


4. Write an informational paragraph about another animal from
the Green Fern Zoo.


5. Share their writing with peers.


6. Work on Pausing Point activities/Activity Pages selected to meet
individual needs.

  - Call on one student and ask them to join you in the assessment area.


  - Tell the student that today they will read some words aloud to you.


  - Tell the student that it is important to do their very best reading.


  - Uncover the first row of words by moving the paper down one space.


  - As the student reads the word, mark any incorrect letter-sound
correspondences above the word on the Word Reading in Isolation
Scoring Sheet. Also, note whether the student incorrectly chunks letters
into syllables, leading to mispronunciation. If the student reads the word
correctly, simply place a check mark by the word.


  - If, after ten seconds, the student is unable to read the word at all, simply
tell the student the word and move on. Mark an X above the word on the
recording sheet.


  - When the student has finished reading the word list, look over the chart to
note any patterns that might appear to indicate gaps in phoneme knowledge
or syllabication difficulties.

Foundational Skills 4


  - Refer to the Word Reading in Isolation Remediation Guide for guidance in
how you might group students to provide targeted remediation.


~~**ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FOR MID-YEAR ASSESSMENT**~~


  - If students performed poorly on the Reading Comprehension Assessment,
but did better on Word Reading in Isolation, you may want to ask these
students to read “Amber the Bat” aloud to you, while you make a running
record of specific errors. Also ask the comprehension questions orally and
have the student respond orally. Additional materials for this oral rereading
of “Amber the Bat” are included in Teacher Resources.


  - As was noted in the introduction, it is critical that you take the time not only
to conduct the Unit 4 Mid-Year Assessment, but to thoroughly examine each
student’s performance to decide if a student is ready to proceed to Unit 5;
needs minimal, targeted remediation; or needs significant remediation. It
is strongly recommended that once all students have completed the MidYear Assessment, you meet with all other grade level teachers who are using
this program to examine student performance across the grade level and
whether regrouping between classes may be warranted.

**Digraph Clothesline**


**Note:** This exercise is meant to be purely oral; it is not a spelling exercise.
It is very likely that students will find pictures of items that contain the
target sounds not spelled with the basic code spellings ‘ar’, ‘or’, ‘er’.


 - Write the vowel sounds /ar/, /or/, and /er/ on individual cards.


 - Hang these cards on a clothesline, allowing space on the line between
the digraphs.


 - Provide students with magazines, newspaper ads, etc.


 - Assign groups of students a particular sound and ask them to search for
pictures of things that contain the target sound.


 - Have students cut out and glue their pictures on small cards and write the
sound on the card next to the picture.


 - Hang the picture cards on the clothesline in the right location.


**Sound Sort**

 - Gather a number of objects or pictures of objects that contain either of two
target sounds (e.g., /er/ and /r/, /er/ and /ar/, /ar/ and /or/).


 - Label two boxes with the sounds (e.g., /er/ and /r/).


 - Ask students to say the name of each object or picture and ask them if it
contains the /er/ sound or /r/ sound.


**Note:** For the /r/ sound choose objects or pictures of items that start
with /r/.

**Adding, Deleting, and Substituting Syllables**


Using a routine to help students learn to add, delete, and substitute syllables
will reinforce their oral syllable awareness.


**Adding Syllables**

 - We can read and write compound words. That means it is made up of two
words that have been pushed together. Say, “ If we start with the word melt
and add the word down, we get a new word with two syllables: melt•down.”


 - Have students repeat the word with you.


**Deleting Syllables**

 - Next, practice deleting syllables from a compound word.


 - Say, “Let’s practice deleting a syllable from the word run•down.”


 - Say, “I hear two syllables. Let’s delete the second syllable, down. Now we
have the word run.”


**Substituting Syllables**

 - Say, “Let’s practice substituting a syllable using the word run•down.

Substituting means to replace a piece of the word with another word part.”


 - Say, “I hear two syllables. Let’s substitute the last syllable, down, with the
word off. Now we have the word run•off.”

~~**TRICKY WORD FAMILY LETTER**~~


Dear Family Member,


In this unit, your student will continue to learn new Tricky Words. Tricky Words are words that
do not follow the rules for decoding that your student has learned, so they simply must learn
and remember how to read and spell them. The tricky parts of each word are underlined. Your
student will be taught to read the following new words as Tricky Words: _Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,_
_Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,_ and _Saturday_ (Lesson 1), and _yesterday, today,_ and _tomorrow_ (Lesson
8). You are being provided with flash cards that include the new words learned in this unit. Your
student should already be able to read all of the other Tricky Words on the flash cards successfully
at the beginning of this unit, as they were taught in earlier units.


Please have your student cut apart the flash cards. In order to build increasingly rapid, automatic
recognition of these words, show the cards to your student in random order and have them read
them to you as quickly as possible several times each week.

~~**TRICKY WORD ASSESSMENT RECORD: BEGINNING AND END OF UNIT 4 (OPTIONAL)**~~


This is an optional assessment of previously taught Tricky Words. At the beginning and end of Unit 4,
show the student the Tricky Word list that follows this record.


Ask the student to read each word on the page from left to right, top to bottom. Provide students
with either a blank sheet of paper or card stock to place on the word list page directly under the row
to be read. As students complete a row, they can slide the paper down just enough to read the
next row.


Record each student’s performance in the following chart, using + to indicate that the word was
read correctly and – to indicate the word was read incorrectly; if the student misreads a completely
different word, record the word read by the student. Mark as incorrect any word that the student
does not read within 3–5 seconds.

student did not spell correctly. All of the words this week are Tricky Words. Tricky Words are words
that do not follow the rules for encoding that students have learned thus far. For now, students
should memorize how to spell these Tricky Words. If a student missed two or more words, speak
with the student and ask them to explain their thinking to you.


This explanation may help you to understand the student’s confusion and allow you to clear up the

Write students’ names in the column provided. The words on today’s spelling assessment are
grouped on the analysis chart according to spelling patterns. Place an X in the column of any
word that the student did not spell correctly. Examine errors for patterns using the information
provided. If a pattern is identified, speak with the student and ask them to explain their thinking
to you. This may help you to understand the student’s confusion and allow you to clear up the
misunderstanding. You may also use previous Pausing Points to address errors with today’s
spelling words.


Column 1


**What an error in this column means:** These words contain the ‘ar’ spelling for /ar/, and two of the
words ( _shark_, _sharp_ ) contain the ‘sh’ digraph for /sh/. Students may be having difficulty hearing the
/ar/ sound, or remembering that the ‘sh’ spelling makes the /sh/ sound.


**What you should do:** If a student is writing the ‘er’ spelling instead of ‘ar’, you may wish to do
Minimal Pairs activities to help the student distinguish sounds. There are multiple activities and
targeted lessons for /ar/ > ‘ar’ in the Unit 4 Pausing Point.


Column 2


**What an error in this column means:** Students may be having difficulty with the spelling ‘er’ for
/er/.


**What you should do:** If a student is writing the ‘ar’ spelling instead of ‘er’, you may wish to do
Minimal Pairs activities to help the student distinguish sounds. There are multiple activities and
targeted lessons for /er/ > ‘er’ in the Unit 4 Pausing Point.


Column 3


**What an error in this column means:** The spelling ‘oi’ for the /oi/ sound is a vowel digraph.
Students may be having difficulty remembering the two letters that stand for this one sound.


**What you should do:** Please refer to the Unit 3 Pausing Point for activities and targeted lessons if
the student needs additional practice with this spelling.


Column 4


**What an error in this column means:** The spelling ‘aw’ for the /aw/ sound is a vowel digraph.
Students may be having difficulty remembering the two letters that stand for this one sound.


**What you should do:** Please refer to the Unit 3 Pausing Point for activities and targeted lessons if
the student needs additional practice with this spelling.

Column 5


**What an error in this column means:** The word _because_ is a Tricky Word from Unit 3. Tricky Words
do not follow the rules for encoding that students have learned thus far. For now, students should
memorize how to spell this Tricky Word.


**What you should do:** Additional practice reading and writing Tricky Words can be found in the
Pausing Points.


Column 6


In the last column, specifically note any other confusion evidenced by individual student errors.
For example, students may have had difficulty encoding the consonant clusters in _spoil_ and _crawl_ .
Please also consider the influence of students’ home language on encoding. Analyze any patterns
and provide targeted remediation using previous Pausing Points.

Write students’ names in the column provided. The words on today’s spelling assessment are
grouped on the analysis chart according to spelling patterns. Place an X in the column of any
word that the student did not spell correctly. Examine errors for patterns using the information
provided. If a pattern is identified, speak with the student and ask them to explain their thinking

Decode Multisyllable Words, for more information on assisting students who have difficulty with
multisyllable words.


Column 1


**What an error in this column means:** These words contain the ‘er’ spelling for /er/. Students may
be having difficulty hearing the /er/ sound, or they could be confusing it with the /ar/ sound.


**What you should do:** If a student is writing the ‘ar’ spelling instead of ‘er’, you may wish to do
Minimal Pairs activities to help the student distinguish sounds. There are multiple activities and
targeted lessons for /er/ > ‘er’ in the Unit 4 Pausing Point.


Column 2


**What an error in this column means:** Students may be having difficulty with the spelling ‘ar’ for
the /ar/.


**What you should do:** If a student is writing the ‘er’ spelling instead of ‘ar’, you may wish to do
Minimal Pairs activities to help the student distinguish sounds. There are multiple activities and
targeted lessons for /ar/ > ‘ar’ in the Unit 4 Pausing Point.


Column 3


**What an error in this column means:** These words contain the ‘or’ spelling for /or/. Students may be
having difficulty hearing the /or/ sound or remembering the spelling.


**What you should do:** Please refer to the Unit 4 Pausing Point for activities and targeted lessons if the
student needs additional practice with this spelling.


Foundational Skills 4


Column 4


**What an error in this column means:** The word _today_ is a Tricky Word from Unit 4. Tricky Words
do not follow the rules for encoding that students have learned thus far. For now, students should
memorize how to spell this Tricky Word.


**What you should do:** Additional practice reading and writing Tricky Words can be found in the
Pausing Points.


Column 5


In the last column, specifically note any other confusion evidenced by individual student errors. For
example, students may have had difficulty remembering to include the ‘g’ as part of the ‘ng’ spelling
for the /ng/ sound at the end of root + ending words. Please also consider the influence of students’
home language on encoding. Analyze any patterns and provide targeted remediation using previous
Pausing Points.

~~**LESSON 20: SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


Write students’ names in the column provided. The words on today’s spelling assessment are grouped
on the analysis chart according to spelling patterns. Place an X in the column of any word that the
student did not spell correctly. Examine errors for patterns using the information provided below. If a
pattern is identified, speak with the student and ask them to explain their thinking to you. This may help
you to understand the student’s confusion and allow you to clear up the misunderstanding. You may
also use previous Pausing Points to address errors with today’s spelling words. The words on this week’s
spelling assessment can be analyzed in many different ways. Analyses focusing on errors in encoding
the past-tense marker is provided here. Some of these words are also two-syllable words, and you
should take note of any difficulty students have in encoding both syllables of two-syllable words. Please
refer to the Appendix, Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words, for more information on assisting
students who have difficulty with multisyllable words.


Column 1


**What an error in this column means:** In these words, the past-tense marker is spelled ‘ed’ and
pronounced /t/, because the root word ends in a voiceless consonant. Students may not have recognized
that these words were in the past tense.


**What you should do:** Refer to the Unit 4 Pausing Point for additional exercises and targeted lessons.


Column 2


**What an error in this column means:** In these words, the past-tense marker is spelled ‘ed’
and pronounced /d/, because the root word ends in a voiced consonant. Students may not have
recognized that these words were in the past tense.


**What you should do:** Refer to the Unit 4 Pausing Point for additional exercises and targeted lessons.


Column 3


**What an error in this column means:** In these words, the past-tense marker is spelled ‘ed’ and
pronounced /ed/, as students might expect because the root words end in a /d/ or /t/ sound. An
error in this column might indicate that students have difficulty encoding two-syllable words.


**What you should do:** Refer to the Unit 4 Pausing Point for additional exercises and targeted
lessons. Please refer to the Appendix, Using Chunking to Decode Multisyllable Words, for more
information on assisting students who have difficulty with multisyllable words.


Foundational Skills 4


Column 4


**What an error in this column means:** The word _have_ is a Tricky Word. Tricky Words do not follow
the rules for encoding that students have learned thus far. For now, students should memorize how
to spell these Tricky Words.


**What you should do:** Additional practice reading and writing Tricky Words can be found in the
Pausing Points.


Column 5


In the last column, specifically note any other confusion evidenced by individual student errors. For
example, did students write just ‘d’ at the end of words, showing they forgot to include the ‘e’? If
they wrote ‘t’ at the end of a word, like for _parked_, they may be confused when hearing the /t/ sound
for the spelling ‘ed’. Please also consider the influence of students’ home language on encoding.
Analyze any patterns and provide targeted remediation using previous Pausing Points.

**Grade 1 | Foundational Skills 4**
Appendix: Using
Chunking to Decode
Multisyllable Words


Mastering the various letter-sound correspondences will enable students to read one-syllable
words with ease. However, knowing these individual letter-sound correspondences is no guarantee
that students will be able to apply this knowledge in reading multisyllable words. To this end, most
students will benefit from additional instruction in learning to recognize, chunk and read parts of
words—syllables—as a way to decode longer words.


When students first encounter two-syllable words in Grade 1 materials, a small dot is used as a
visual prompt or cue between the syllables (e.g., _sun·set_ ). This is done in both the Activity Books
and Readers. The dot is intended to visually break the word into two chunks, each of which can then
be sounded out separately. As Grade 1 progresses, the dot is eliminated and students are expected
to begin visually chunking parts of longer words on their own.


Starting in Grade 1, this program introduces the decoding of two-syllable words by having students
work first with two-syllable compound words (e.g., _cat·fish_, _cup·cake_, _pea·nut_, _drive·way_ ). For
compound words, the dot is placed between the two component words. These are among the easiest
two-syllable words to chunk and decode because each syllable of a compound word is already a
familiar spelling pattern students have encountered in reading one-syllable words. In addition,
each syllable or chunk is also frequently recognizable as a word part that has semantic familiarity.


In addition to learning to decode two-syllable compound words, Grade 1 students also tackle twosyllable words that consist of a root word with a simple suffix (e.g., _yawn·ing_, _hunt·er_, _bust·ed_ ). The
dot is typically placed immediately before the suffix. However, for words that contain double-letter
spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed after the double-letter spelling rather than
between the two consonants (e.g. _batt·ed_, _bigg·er_, _bunn·y_ ). Teachers familiar with other ways to
chunk or divide syllables may initially find this odd. This is done, however, because the double-letter
spellings have been taught as single-spelling units since Kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’ > /m/, ‘tt’ >
/t/, etc.). This program strives to be consistent in representing these spellings in the way that
the students have been taught to process them (e.g., as whole entities for a sound). (Ultimately,
as students become more proficient at decoding and chunking syllables through subsequent grade
levels, it really does not matter whether they visually chunk and decode these words as _batt·ed_ or
_bat·ted_ .) Most students find chunking and decoding these two-syllable words consisting of root
words and suffixes relatively easy.


Appendix
**427**


**428**



A greater challenge is encountered when chunking and decoding other types of multisyllable words.
To be successful in decoding these longer words, it is helpful if teachers and students recognize
certain syllable types. Most reading specialists identify six different syllable types:


**Note:** Syllables exemplifying each type are underlined.


 - **Closed Syllables (CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc.)—always associated with a “short” vowel sound**
**(e.g., /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/):** _let,_ _pad,_ _rod,_ _tin,_ _fun,_ _pic·nic,_ _un·til_


 - **Magic ‘E’ Syllables (V-C–E)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/,**
**/ie/, /oe/, /ue/):** _cake,_ _home,_ _like,_ _mule,_ _Pete, mis·take, stam·pede_


 - **Vowel Digraph Syllables:** _joint,_ _speak,_ _proud,_ _play, dis·may, be·low,_ _coun·sel_


 - **R-Controlled Syllables:** _art, curb, girl, fort, clerk, tur·nip, ar·tist, fe·ver_


 - **Open Syllables (V or CV)—always associated with a “long” vowel sound (e.g., /ae/, /ee/, /ie/,**
**/oe/, /ue/):** _go, me, hi, a·pron, fi·nal, com·pre·hend_


 - **Consonant–LE Syllables (C–LE):** _sim·ple, puz·zle, raf·fe, ca·ble, ri·fe_


In addition, it is also helpful to designate one additional syllable type:


 - **Schwa Syllables:** _ben·e·fit, ap·pe·tite, a·bout, hos·pit·al, e·mo·tion_


**Note:** The Consonant–LE Syllable is also a schwa syllable, but it is distinguished separately because
of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


**To be clear, in order to decode words, students do not need to identify syllables by these**
**names. The names of the syllable types are provided here only to establish a common**
**vocabulary for teachers as they use the materials.** What is necessary, however, for students
to become fluent readers of longer words in increasingly complex text is that they be able to
visually parse certain spelling patterns as syllable chunks so they can quickly and easily decode
each syllable.


The first type of two-syllable word pattern to which students are introduced is the closed syllable
pattern in two-syllable words. These two-syllable words are also relatively easy for students to
chunk and recognize as an example of the familiar CVC, VC, CCVCC, etc., spelling pattern they
encountered in one-syllable words in Kindergarten.


Two closed syllables in a word are divided as follows:


 - When two different consonants stand between two vowels, the syllables are divided between the
consonants, creating one or more closed syllables.


_ad · mit_ _nap · kin_ _trum · pet_


Foundational Skills 4


  - For words that contain double-letter spellings for consonants, the divider is typically placed after the
double-letter spelling rather than between the consonants. As noted earlier, this is done because the
double-letter spellings have been taught as single spelling units since Kindergarten (‘nn’ > /n/, ‘mm’

   - /m/, ‘tt’ > /t/, etc.).


_traff · ic_ _muff · in_ _happ · en_


  - When there are three consonants between two vowels, in general, the word is divided so the first
consonant goes with the first vowel and the other two consonants with the second vowel.


_mon · ster_ _con · tract_ _pil · grim_


When students have difficulty reading a two-syllable word, you may find it useful to use your finger
to cover the second syllable, revealing only the first syllable for them to read. Once students read
the first syllable, the second syllable can be uncovered and read. If necessary, you can then model
for students how to blend the two syllables aloud:


In Grade 1, students will encounter other two-syllable words with various combinations of the
magic ‘e’ syllable, the vowel digraph syllable, the r-controlled vowel syllable, and the closed syllable.


  - Chunking these syllable types follows the same patterns for division as noted above for
closed syllables:


_tar · get_ _for · get_ _es · cape_ _ig · loo_ _scoun · drel_ _char · coal_


In Grade 2, students are introduced to more challenging multisyllable words.


Two-syllable words with only one consonant between the vowels are especially difficult to chunk
because they may be divided either before or after the single consonant. Students are taught to use
a flexible approach in chunking syllables with a single consonant between the vowels, trying each
possibility when they encounter an unfamiliar word.


Appendix
**429**


**430**




 - When only one consonant stands between two vowels, first divide the word in front of the consonant
and sound it out as an open syllable:


_pu · pil_ _vi · rus_ _mo · ment_


However, sometimes the word may divide after the consonant, creating a closed syllable. There is
no definitive rule for when to divide before or after the consonant. Students will need to be flexible
and try dividing and sounding the word each way—before and/or after the consonant—to determine
whether they recognize a familiar word as they sound out each possibility. In order to recognize
whether a word is familiar when sounded either way, the word must be one that the student has
heard before (i.e., the word must be in the student’s oral vocabulary). Obviously, this will represent
an additional challenge for students who have a limited vocabulary and/or for whom English is a
second language.


 - If the word divides after the consonant, a closed syllable is created:


_cam · el_ _mel · on_ _pun · ish_


In Grade 2, students are also introduced to Consonant–LE Syllables. Chunking these words into
syllables is fairly straightforward.


Foundational Skills 4


  - When a word ends in Consonant–LE, the word is divided in front of the consonant, creating a first
syllable that may be an open, closed or even r-controlled syllable, depending on the other spellings
in the words:


_ban · gle_ _twin · kle_ _sta · ble_ _cra · dle_ _tur · tle_


In the later part of Grade 2, students are introduced to syllables in which various spellings represent
the schwa sound. English words with more than one syllable usually include a combination of stressed
and unstressed syllables. When a syllable in a spoken word is unstressed or weakly stressed, its
vowel sound is often reduced to a flat, rather nondescript vowel sound that linguists call a schwa.
This happens in many English words. Spellings for the schwa sound include ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘al’, ‘il’, ‘el’ and ‘tion’.
Chunking and decoding words that include the schwa sound can be quite challenging for
many students.


  - Syllables with a schwa sound are divided in different ways, recognizing that the syllable with the
schwa sound has a particular spelling:


_a · bout_ _de · pos · it_ _med · al_ _e · vil_ _nick · el_ _lo · tion_


As noted earlier, the Consonant–LE Syllable is actually a schwa syllable, but it is identified
separately because of the way this spelling is chunked when dividing words into syllables.


  - Finally, while students encountered some simple root words and affixes in Grade 1, they study
prefixes, suffixes, and root words in much greater depth and are taught to chunk syllables accordingly
throughout the entire year of Grade 3 instruction.


_pre·tend_ _non·sense_ _tri·cycle_ _re·peat_ _self·ish_ _sad·ness_ _help·less_


By combining the specific code knowledge of letter-sound spellings taught in Kindergarten—Grade
3, with the ability to chunk multisyllable words into smaller decodable parts, students will have the
tools they need to independently decode just about any word they encounter.
