## **Martez, Martez, Martez**

J **ay** ’s dad checks J **ay** ’s plate .

“J **ay**,” he says, “have some of your
coleslaw! Food is not free!”

J **ay** smiles . “Food is not free” is
something his dad says a lot . He is a man
who likes to save as much cash as he can .
He hates p **ay** ing for food that ends up in
the trash .

J **ay** cuts his pork chop and lifts a bite of
it into the **ai** r .


2


3


“Martez likes pork chops,” J **ay** says . “But
he hates coleslaw .”

J **ay** pops the bite of pork chop in his
mouth . Then he says, “Martez likes to pl **ay**
hopscotch and draw pictures with cr **ay** ons .”

After a bit, he adds, “Martez can run the
fastest on the pl **ay** ground .”

“Martez, Martez, Martez!” says J **ay** ’s dad .
“Who is this Martez?”

“He’s my pal .”


4


5


“Is Martez in your class?” asks J **ay** ’s mom .

J **ay** nods .

“Is he nice?”

“He is the best!”

“So should we invite Martez to visit us for
dinner?”

“Yes!” says J **ay** with a shout . “Can we
invite him tomorrow?”


6


7


## **Dinner with Jay**

The next d **ay**, Martez visits J **ay** ’s house
for dinner . J **ay** ’s mom serves corn on the
cob .

Martez tells J **ay** ’s mom, “I like this corn a
lot! You are a good cook!”

“Thank you!” says J **ay** ’s mom .


8


9


“I picked the corn myself, and it was on
sale!” J **ay** ’s dad brags . He is proud to think
that he got good corn at a farm .

Martez says, “This corn is so sweet . You
picked well .”


10


11


After dinner, J **ay** and Martez run
outside . They splash in the pool and pl **ay**
tag .

While doing the dishes, J **ay** ’s mom
says, “What a nice kid that Martez is!”

“Yes,” says J **ay** ’s dad . “And he ate all of
the food on his plate!”

When pl **ay** time is finished, Martez
runs inside to thank J **ay** ’s mom and dad
for dinner .

Then he asks, “Can J **ay** have dinner at
our house tomorrow?”

J **ay** ’s mom and dad s **ay** he can . They
like Martez .


12


13


## **The Red Dish**

The next day, J **ay** has dinner with Martez
and his mom and dad . Martez’s mom and
dad were born in Mexico, but they are proud
to be Americans now .

They have a Mexican dish with peppers,
corn, and rice all mixed up . There are two
dishes of it sitting side by side . One dish is
red . One is green .

“Are the two dishes the same?” J **ay** asks .

“Nope,” says Martez with a smile . “The
stuff in the red dish has lots of hot peppers .
The stuff in the green dish has just green
peppers, which are not as hot .”


14


15


Martez points at his dad and says, “My
dad likes hot peppers .”

His dad smiles and nods .

Martez asks J **ay**, “Do you like hot
peppers?”

J **ay** shrugs . He has never had hot peppers .

J **ay** has some food from the green dish .
He likes it a lot . He says, “Could I have
some from the red dish?”

“You can, but it’s hot, hot, hot!” says
Martez . “We have a s **ay** ing in our house: _He_
_is a brave man who has food from Dad’s red_
_dish!_ ”

“Brave or perhaps foolish!” says his
mom .


16


17


J **ay** is brave—or perhaps foolish . He
takes a bite of the peppers from the red dish .
Martez looks at him . His mom and dad
look, too .

“Do you like it?” asks Martez .

J **ay** ’s face starts to get red . He yells,
“Hot!”

His face gets redder and redder .

Martez sees that J **ay** is in p **ai** n . He brings
him ice cubes . J **ay** stuffs some in his mouth
and lets them melt . The ice cubes help cool
down his mouth .


18


19


“Ug!” J **ay** says, sitting back from his plate .
“Those peppers in the red dish are too hot
for me! I need to stick to the green dish .”

“Still,” Martez says, “tod **ay** you joined the
club .”

“What club?”

“The I-ate-from-Dad’s-red-dish-andam-still-living-to-tell-the-tale club!” says
Martez .

Martez and his mom and dad all smile .
They like J **ay** .


20


21


## **In the Mail**

In the summer, Martez takes a trip to
Mexico with his mom and dad . He sends
J **ay** a card with a picture of a place in
Mexico on it .

The card says, “J **ay**, I am on a trip with
my mom and dad . It is fun . I can’t w **ai** t to
get back so we can pl **ay** and I can tell you
about my trip .” Then there are some words
that J **ay** can’t make out .

“Mom!” Jay says, “Martez wrote me this
card, but I can’t make out the last part .”

J **ay** ’s mom looks at the card . She smiles .
“That’s Spanish . Lots of Mexicans write in
Spanish .”


22


23


“Why do they write in Spanish?” J **ay** asks .


“Well, you see, w **ay** back in the past, men
from Sp **ai** n came to Mexico . Becau se the
men from Sp **ai** n spoke and wrote Spanish,
the Mexicans began to talk and write in
Spanish, too . And that is why, to this d **ay**,
lots of Mexicans still talk and write in
Spanish .”


“But what do the words s **ay** ?”


“Let me see,” says J **ay** ’s mom . “I took a
Spanish class . Martez says, ‘You are my best
pal . See you soon!’”


J **ay** hugs the card and shouts, “Martez is
the best!”


24


25


## **The Holiday**

When Martez gets back from his trip, he
invites J **ay** to visit him at home .

When J **ay** steps in, he sees lots of singing
and dancing . There is a flag with green, white,
and red stripes pinned up in the living room .

“What’s up?” J **ay** asks .

Martez explains, “My parents are proud
to be Americans now . But they also like this
d **ay** . It is September 16 . It is a big holid **ay**
for Mexicans .”


26


27


“On this d **ay**,” Martez explains, “they
p **ay** tribute to a man who helped set Mexico
free from the Spanish . You see, for a long
time, the Spanish were in charge in Mexico .
All of the land in Mexico was theirs . Then
one man got tired of it and set out to make
things better .”

Martez points at a picture and says, “This
is the man who started it all . His name was
Hidalgo . He made a speech . He said the
Mexicans should be free from the Spanish .”


28


29


“Did they do it?” asks J **ay** .

“Yes . It took a long time, but in the end,
they did .”

“Is it sort of like when the U .S . declared
their independence from Britain?” J **ay** asks .

“Yes, yes!” Martez says . “It is just like
that!”

J **ay** points at the flag . It has three stripes:
one green, one white, and one red . “Is that
the Mexican flag?” he asks .

“Yes,” says Martez .


30


31


## **Better than the Best**

J **ay** has started to spend a lot of time with
Martez .

He has started to use some Spanish
words, too .

When his dad spoons rice onto his
plate one d **ay**, J **ay** says, “Gracias .” Then he
explains that _gracias_ is Spanish for _thank you_ .

J **ay** ’s mom says, “J **ay**, would you like to
have a chance to use those Spanish words of
yours in Mexico?”

“Are you kidding?” J **ay** excl **ai** ms . “That
would be the best!”


32


33


“Well, your dad and I have planned a trip
to Mexico .”

J **ay** shouts, “Yippee!”

J **ay** ’s mom has a big smile on her face . She
says, “How would you like to bring Martez
with you on the trip?”

J **ay** ’s jaw drops . “If Martez is on the trip,
that would be better than the best!” he says .

His mom adds, “Martez just needs to ask
his mom and dad .”

J **ay** jumps up and shouts, “I can’t w **ai** t to
tell Martez!”


34


35


## **The Long Cab Ride**

J **ay** and Martez just got to Mexico with
J **ay** ’s mom and dad . They are at the **ai** rport .
They are looking for a cab that will take
them to the place where they are st **ay** ing .

J **ay** ’s dad waves his hand and gets a cab .


36


37


A man jumps out of a cab and shouts,
“Greetings! I’m Carlos . Where can I drive
you on this fine d **ay** ?”

“To the inn,” says J **ay** ’s dad .

Carlos steps on the gas . The cab picks
up speed .

“I will take you to the inn,” Carlos says,
“and on the w **ay** I will take you to see
some nice sites here in Mexico . There are
lots of nice sites on the w **ay** .”

“Thanks,” says J **ay** ’s dad, “but we are
tired from the trip . So you can just take us
to where we are staying .”


38


39


“Aw,” says J **ay** . He looks sad . J **ay** ’s dad
does not want him to be sad .

“We can do a short trip to see some of
your sites,” he says to Carlos .

“Here in Mexico,” Carlos says, “we have
all sorts of land . There are hills and pl **ai** ns .
There are deserts, r **ai** nforests, and wetlands .
I will take you to see some wetlands on
the w **ay** !”

“Wetlands?” says J **ay** ’s dad . “That
sounds like a long trip .”

“Hush!” J **ay** ’s mom whispers . “Let
Carlos share .”


40


41


Carlos waves his hands and describes
things as he drives .

“On the left, you can see a soccer game .
Soccer is a big sport in Mexico .”

“That is an Aztec farm,” Carlos says .

“Here is a good place for shopping .”

“That is my mom’s house .”

At last, the cab zips up to the inn .

Carlos tells J **ay** ’s dad the price of the cab
ride . J **ay** ’s dad is upset . It was a long ride,
and he must p **ay** a lot .

But J **ay** and Martez are glad . They talk
and talk about the sites they saw .


42


43


## **The Vote**

The next morning, J **ay** ’s dad is still a bit
upset that the cab ride cost s **o** much . But
J **ay** ’s mom is not .

“I liked that cab ride yesterd **ay**,” she
says . “I liked having someone in the car
who could tell us what’s what .”

J **ay** says, “I liked that, too .”

Martez says, “Me too! My dad tells me
stuff when we come . I always like it .”


44


45


J **ay** ’s mom says, “I think we should hire
someone who has a car and can tell us what
there is to see down here in Mexico . The
man at the desk gave me a name . He says
this man—Mister Gomez is his name—has a
car . If we hire him, he will drive us to see all
of the best sites .”

“But that will cost a lot!” says J **ay** ’s dad .
“Why should we p **ay** when we can see all
the same sites by ourselves? Look, I got this
book on Mexico in a bookshop for used
books . It will tell us all of the same stuff that
the man would tell us! And it has lots of
pictures!”


46


47


“It’s not the same!” says J **ay** ’s mom . “And
that book of yours is out of date . Let’s have a
vote . Who votes we hire Mister Gomez?”

J **ay** ’s mom r **ai** ses her hand at once . J **ay** ’s
hand shoots up fast, too . Martez w **ai** ts a bit .
Then he r **ai** ses his hand as well .

“That’s three votes for Mister Gomez and
one vote for your book,” b **oa** sts J **ay** ’s mom .

J **ay** ’s dad gr **oa** ns .


48


49


## **Mister Gomez**

Mister Gomez is at the inn the next
morning . He takes them outside and points
to a stone with his cane .

“This stone has stood here for a long,
long time,” Mister Gomez s **ay** s . “It has stood
here much longer than me . This stone is
from the time of the Aztec Empire .”

“The what?” J **ay** asks .

“The Aztec Empire,” s **ay** s Mister Gomez .
“Back in the past, Aztec men were skilled
workers that used stones and gems to make
things . They used tools to make large
carvings, masks, and homes .”

“Did the Aztecs live here?” Jay says .


50


51


Mister Gomez waves his cane and
s **ay** s, “Lots of the old stones in this
square were cut w **ay** back in Aztec
times . They were used by the Aztecs to
make things . Then they were used by
Cortez and the Spanish . And we still use
them tod **ay** .”


52


53


Martez s **ay** s, “The stones are huge! It
must have been so hard to drag all of them
here and stack them up . It is so cool that we
are standing on the same stones!” The smile
on J **ay** ’s face says that he thinks so too .


54


55


J **ay** ’s mom jabs J **ay** ’s dad in the
side and s **ay** s, “Looks like we are fine
without that book of yours!”


56


57


## **A House in the Clouds**

Mister Gomez drives all of them to the
next place . In the car, Mister Gomez s **ay** s,
“Can I offer you a snack? This is a paleta .”

J **ay** and Martez like the paletas . J **ay** s **ay** s,
“This is good! I like the taste!”

Martez s **ay** s, “This tastes like an ice pop .”


58


59


Mister Gomez explains that a paleta is
a Mexican snack that can be made fresh
with different foods like lime and banana .
It can also have sweet milk in it . He tells
them that paleta means “little stick .”

Mister Gomez s **ay** s that kids in Mexico
have liked the snack for a long time .

In the car, they pass trees, hills, and
streets on their trip . Mister Gomez s **ay** s,
“You will like this next place . The stones
there have stood for much, much longer
than the last stones .”


60


61


When they get to the site, they see
three vast piles of stone, all of which
rise to a point and seem to scrape the
clouds . One of them is so big that J **ay**
and Martez have to tilt their necks
all the w **ay** back to see the top of it .


62


63


“Goodness!” J **ay** ’s mom s **ay** s .

“Cool!” s **ay** s Martez .

“Was this an important place for the
Aztecs?” J **ay** ’s mom asks .

“Yes,” s **ay** s Mister Gomez . “The pyramids
were made w **ay** back in the past . They were
important to the Aztecs . They used the
pyramids for different things .”


64


“Can we go to the top of one of them?” J **ay**
asks .

“No, you can’t go up there anymore,”
Mister Gomez s **ay** s . “They want to keep this
place safe so that it can last for a long time .”

J **ay** and Martez look all the way up to the
top . J **ay** s **ay** s, “The pyramid is so tall it could
touch the clouds .”

Martez says, “Maybe a long time ago they
called it a house in the clouds!”


65


## **The Market**

The next d **ay**, J **ay**, Martez, and J **ay** ’s
mom and dad take a trip to a street market .
Mister Gomez joins them .

At the market, all sorts of things are on
sale . Some men are selling food . Some are
selling arts and crafts . There are p **ai** ntings
and knickknacks and cloth stitched in fun
patterns .


66


67


One man is selling masks made from
wood .

J **ay** ’s mom spots a mask that she likes . It
is a red mask with glitter .

“Good choice,” says Mister Gomez .
“Masks have been in Mexico a long time!
The Aztecs had them too . This one is made
from wood .”

“Why do people here make masks?” J **ay**
says .

“Some are used for a dance on holidays,”
says Martez .

“Yes!” says the man who is selling masks .
“I painted this one by hand for just that .”

He puts the red mask to his face and does
some steps .

J **ay** and Martez cheer .


68


69


“That is fun,” says J **ay** ’s mom . “I have to
get it!”

But J **ay** ’s dad looks at the price tag .

“That price is a lot,” he says . “We need
to stick to our spending limit . See if you can
get it for less .”

Martez and J **ay** both look sad .

“No, I should pay the full price!” says
J **ay** ’s mom . “This man did a lot of work on
this mask .”

She puts the mask on her face . She wants
to make dad smile, but he looks sad . “I
would like to get it for you, but we have
spent so much,” he says .

“That is okay,” says mom . She puts the
mask back .”


70


71


## **A Rainforest Ride**

The next d **ay**, they s **ay** farewell to Mister
Gomez . J **ay** ’s dad rents a car to take them to
see the r **ai** nforest .

In the r **ai** nforest, it is hot and wet . A
thick l **ay** er of trees blocks out part of the
sun .

J **ay** ’s mom drives . J **ay** ’s dad shares facts
from his book .

As they drive, J **ay** spots a zip line that
children can ride .


72


73


“Mom, Dad!” he yells . “Can we stop and
ride the zip line? It looks like so much fun!”

J **ay** ’s mom parks the car . The zip line runs
from a tree house down to the ground .

“Is it safe?” J **ay** ’s mom asks the man in
charge .

“Yes,” says the man . “It’s safe . The
children ride in a harness . And there is a net
down there to catch them, just in case .”


74


J **ay** ’s mom thinks it looks safe . She p **ay** s
the man and gets two tickets, one for J **ay**
and one for Martez .

Martez gets belted into the harness . Then
he rides the zip line . He shouts as he slides
down the line .

J **ay** yells down, “Is it fun, Martez?”

Martez yells back, “It’s the best!”

J **ay** gets belted in . He has a fun ride, too .


75


## **The Dive**

J **ay** ’s dad drives to the c **oa** st of the Gulf of
Mexico . For two d **ay** s, the children s **oa** k up
the sun and swim in the pool .

On d **ay** three, they dive in the Gulf of
Mexico . They rent masks, fins, and tanks of
**ai** r . Then a man brings them out to the dive
site in a b **oa** t . The dive site is a reef where a
Spanish ship sank .

They jump in and swim down . With their
fins on, they can swim fast . With their masks
on, they can see a long way down . They see
fish and crabs . Martez spots a starfish .


76


77


Martez and J **ay** look for the Spanish
ship . They swim down until they see it .
They see fish swimming in and out of it .
Then they swim back up .


78


79


## **At the Airport**

The trip has ended . It is time to get back
to the U .S .

J **ay** ’s dad drives to the **ai** rport . J **ay** ’s mom
st **ay** s with J **ay** and Martez while he drops off
the car .

J **ay** and Martez pl **ay** with an **ai** rplane and
toss it in the **ai** r . It makes a big loop and
glides down .


80


81


J **ay** ’s dad had fun on the trip, but he
spent a lot of cash . He takes what is left of
his Mexican cash and has it turned back into
U .S . cash .

At the ticket counter, J **ay** ’s dad takes
charge . He barks out orders .

“This w **ay**, J **ay** !”

“St **ay** close to me, Martez!”

“Children, get out your passports!”

The children get their passports out .
J **ay** ’s mom gets hers out . But J **ay** ’s dad’s is
nowhere to be found .


82


83


J **ay** ’s dad unzips his bag to look for his
passport . Soon he is digging in the bag,
tossing things this w **ay** and that . At last, he
sees his passport .

“Here it is!” he says, with a sheepish
look .

Martez, J **ay**, and his mom all smile .
J **ay** ’s dad sometimes has a hard time
keeping track of things .

“Dad,” J **ay** says, “maybe you are tired .
Let’s go back home .”

**About this Book**

This book has been created for use by students learning to read with the program.
Readability levels are suitable for early readers. The book has also been carefully leveled
in terms of its “code load,” or the number of spellings used in the stories.

The English writing system is complex. It uses more than 200 spellings to stand for
40-odd sounds. Many sounds can be spelled several different ways, and many spellings
can be pronounced several different ways. This book has been designed to make early
reading experiences simpler and more productive by using a subset of the available
spellings. It uses _only_ spellings students have been taught to sound out as part of their
phonics lessons, plus a handful of Tricky Words, which have also been deliberately
introduced in the lessons. This means the stories will be 100% decodable if they are
assigned at the proper time.

As the students move through the program, they learn new spellings and the “code
load” in the decodable Readers increases gradually. The code load graphic on this page
indicates the number of spellings students are expected to know in order to read the
first story of the book and the number of spellings students are expected to know in
order to read the final stories in the book. The columns on the opposite page list the
specific spellings and Tricky Words students are expected to recognize at the beginning
of this Reader. The bullets at the bottom of the opposite page identify spellings,
Tricky Words, and other topics that are introduced gradually in the unit this Reader
accompanies.
