Consonant Code Flip Book


In Grade 1, the code information is presented to students through two
instructional tools: (1) Code Flip Books (one for consonants and one for vowels)
used for group instruction and classroom display; and (2) Individual Code
Charts for each student. The Code Flip Books are used with a set of Spelling
Cards that are to be affixed to the appropriate Flip Book pages as sounds and
spellings are reviewed in Unit 1. The Code Flip Books show (in grey print) the
spellings for all sounds taught in Grade 1. As you review the sounds in this
unit (and introduce new sounds in the later Grade 1 units), you will be asked to
place the Spelling Card on the appropriate Code Flip Book page.


Each Spelling Card is printed on front and back.







indication of how common this spelling is for the sound
it represents. A long power bar that stretches almost
across the card means that this is the main spelling for
the sound and there are very few words that have this
sound spelled any other way. A very short power bar
means that the spelling is less common and occurs in
fewer English words.
