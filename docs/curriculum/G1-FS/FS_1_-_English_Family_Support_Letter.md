# **Welcome!**
## Grade 1, Unit 1 Foundational Skills

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will become familiar with daily routines and exercises and will review the sounds and spellings

taught in Kindergarten, as well as take placement assessments to determine their knowledge of skills taught already

and be introduced to nouns.


**What** **will** **my** **student** **learn?**


Students will learn how the lessons are set up and will engage in daily reading activities that help them think about

letter-sound relationships and the written English language after the summer break. They will review the spellings

for twenty-five of the different consonant sounds, including two letters that make one sound, such as the letters ‘ch’,

which make the sound /ch/; double-letter spellings, such as the letters ‘ff’, which make the sound /f/; and tricky

spellings, where a spelling can make more than one sound, such as the letter ‘s’, which can make the /s/ sound and

the /z/ sound, as in _is_ or _has_ . Students will also review the five short vowel sounds. As students review the spellings,

they will cover several things at once, including the sound, the letter name, the lowercase letter, and the uppercase

letter.


Students will begin to read stories that follow the spelling ideas they have been taught. These stories, from the

Reader _Snap_ _Shots_, are told from the view of a young girl named Beth who travels from the United States to the

United Kingdom to visit friends. Students will learn the rules of partner reading and silent reading. They will also

answer questions about the stories through spoken and written language.
