**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from the Teacher
Guide for Unit 1. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to the lesson number
and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if there are two activity pages
for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2. The activity pages in this book
do not include written instructions for students because the instructions would have words that
are not decodable. Teachers will explain these activity pages to the students orally, using the
instructions in the Teacher Guide. The Activity Book is a student component, which means each
student should have an Activity Book.

Your child has been taught to read words by saying the sounds and then blending them
together to make a word. Below are some words your child should be able to read with
practice. Ask your child to cut out the word cards. Show the cards to your child and have
him or her read them. Please encourage your child to read the words by saying individual
sounds and then blending them together to make a word. The words marked with a star
are Tricky Words. These are words that are not pronounced as students may expect; we
say that Tricky Words do not play by the rules. As an extension of this activity, ask your
child to copy the words onto a sheet of paper. Please keep the word cards for future
practice.

Encourage your child to read the story to you and talk about it together.

**The Bus**


Dot led us to a bus stop. At the
bus stop there was a thrush.


Kat held up her hand. The thrush
was all set to land on her hand,
but then Dot said, “Kat, stop that!”


Kat let her hand drop.


At the bus stop, Kat said, “Beth,
this is the best bus!”


I said, “Why? Is it fast?”


“No,” Kat said, “it is not that fast.”


“Then why is it the best?”


Just then, Kat said, “There it is!”


It was a big red bus with a top
deck!

**The Flag Shop**


Mom and I went in a lot of
shops in the U.K. One of the
shops was a flag shop.


The shop had the U.S. flag, the
French flag, and the U.K. flag.


That’s Mom in the snap shot,
with the U.S. flag.


The U.K. flag has a big red cross
on it.


Kat and her mom held one up.

**The Man in the Kilt**


Once Kat and I met a man in a kilt.


I said, “Why is that man in a dress?”


Kat said, “That is not a dress. It is a
kilt.”


“A quilt?” I said.


“No,” Kat said. “A kilt.”


“What is a kilt?” I said.


Mom said, “The kilt tells us that the
man is a Scot. The cloth on the kilt
tells us where the man is from.”


“So the kilt tells us his past?” I said.


“Yes,” said Mom. “It is a bit of his past.”


Mom got this snap shot of us with the
man in the kilt!

**The Map**


Once all of us were on a trip when
a dog ran up and bit the map.


Dot said, “Bad dog! Stop that! Drop
that map! Drop it!”


But the dog did not drop the map.
The dog ran up the block with the
map.


Kat ran to get the map, but Dot
said, “It is just a map. Let the dog
have it.”


Just then the dog let the map drop.
Kat got it and held it up.


“Here it is,” Kat said. “But it’s got a
big rip in it.”


“Well,” Dot said, “I am just glad the
dog bit the map and not one of us.”
