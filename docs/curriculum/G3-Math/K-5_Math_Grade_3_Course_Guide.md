**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 3


**Introduction**

Welcome to the Grade 3 Course Guide. This guide is designed to give Grade 3 teachers specific knowledge
about the structure of the instructional materials to help them effectively transition into the program.
Included in this guide is information about standards, assessment tools, the focus of each module, and ways
for families to support students at home. This guide also provides information about how to tailor the culture
of learning to the developmental needs of students, including a background on developmental advances
that affect how students learn in Grade 3 and practical strategies for troubleshooting misconceptions
collaboratively with students.


**Profile of a Grade 3 Math Learner**

Grades 2 through 4 cover a period when students’ math abilities are rapidly changing, growing, and starting to
come together. Their motor skills, estimation abilities, abstract reasoning, self-regulation, and peer interaction
skills need to be coordinated for them to be successful with the instructional materials. Often, this means that
students may become confused or solve problems incorrectly because one or more of the requisite skills are
still developing. For example, students with developing motor skills may have difficulty with manipulating tiles
during activities that teach arrays.

Students at these grade levels are also at the very beginning of developing their abstract reasoning abilities.
For this reason, students can find it challenging to reason about inequalities with different units (e.g., that
10 cm is smaller than 5 m, despite 10 being a larger whole number than 5) or inequalities with different place
values (e.g., that 900 is less than 1,100, even though 9 is greater than 1). Students’ concrete and rule-based
reasoning can also make it more challenging for them to grasp key principles in arithmetic (e.g., that 3 × 6 is
the same as 6 × 3).

In grades 2 through 4, many students are still developing into fluent readers, which might cause them to focus
on certain terms in a word problem and ignore the rest of the context (e.g., they look for the word _total_ and
then add the numbers in the problem). In addition, students’ self-control is still developing. This might cause
students to rush to solve problems and write down the first answer they think of.

These emerging skills need to be coordinated to solve math problems correctly. As a result, teachers of
students in this age range play an important role in helping young math learners learn the math content
and in laying a foundation for number sense, arithmetic, problem solving, and more. This work will prepare
students for more complex and representational math later in the instructional materials. This means
that teachers need to look at the underlying reasons why a student might have gotten a problem
wrong—whether it is an abstract reasoning skill, a literacy skill, or an impulsivity issue—and tailor
instruction appropriately.

The modules in the _Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Math_ instructional materials are designed to effectively help
teachers analyze students’ work and provide the instructional support that best meets students’ needs.
The activities support students’ developmental needs by identifying student misconceptions and providing
guidance to address these misconceptions. This ensures that students can move away from an algorithmic,
rule-based version of math—which can often lead them astray as the concepts become more complex—
toward a more holistic competence with mathematical reasoning. For example, teachers are encouraged to
have students work in small groups on problems and explain their reasoning to one another. This approach
allows teachers and students to identify and correct misconceptions as they arise.

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 3


For students to benefit from the _Bluebonnet Learning_ _K–5 Math_ instructional materials approach, they need
to be provided with opportunities to engage in productive struggle. This means that students boldly and
confidently learn to confront mistakes, reframe them into learning opportunities, and then move forward,
deepening their mathematical reasoning throughout the year. One of the best ways to encourage students
to embrace productive struggle is to promote a classroom culture of learning. A culture of learning is one
in which students embrace the process of productive struggle. It is also a culture free from the common
idea that “fast at math = good at math.” By creating a culture of learning and encouraging students to view
challenges as an expected and even desirable part of the learning process, teachers can help students avoid
a fear of math that could undermine the mathematical future of many students. Instead, students can start
enjoying and feeling confident in math even if their answers do not always come quickly.


**Culture of Learning in Grade 3**

As noted in the Program and Implementation Guide, the way to engage math learners and help them embrace
the productive struggle that’s needed to learn deeply is to create a culture of learning. [1] As shown in the figure
below, a culture of learning rests on a foundation of (1) high-quality instructional materials, (2) a teacher’s
intentions, and (3) the language that communicates the intent of teachers and materials.







1 Yeager. _10 to 25_, 2024.

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 3


A culture of learning can be created beginning on the first day of Module 1. A teacher can use language that
communicates their intent for all students to be supported as they are held to a high standard for learning. [2]
A culture of learning can also be maintained throughout the year since teachers will continue to support
math learners as they embrace challenge. For example, teachers can use language that clarifies their intent of
assigning the rigorous challenges students will face in the instructional materials.

A challenge for teachers is that it can take longer to use language that supports a culture of learning _._ However,
using language that communicates a culture of learning supports students’ developmental needs and learning.
In contrast, language that communicates a culture of compliance can undermine students’ motivation
and engagement because it doesn’t fit with their developmentally appropriate desire for autonomy and
understanding. [3]












|Teacher Behavior|Language that Communicates<br>a Culture of Compliance|Language that Communicates<br>a Culture of Learning|
|---|---|---|
|Introduce the next<br>activity in the lesson<br>plan.|Do this next. You’ll get a bad<br>grade if you don’t.|This next activity will help you understand<br>the material better because ______.|
|Give students a set<br>of problems that they<br>aren’t supposed to finish<br>perfectly in the allotted<br>time (e.g. Sprint).|Just do your best.|Most of you won’t answer all these problems<br>and you might not get them all correct.<br>That’s okay. I’m trying to challenge you<br>so that I can learn what you’re prepared<br>to do and what I need to teach you next.|
|Ask students to explain<br>their thinking on a<br>problem answered<br>incorrectly.|Tell me why you got this wrong.|I’d like you to explain your thinking about<br>this answer. It will help me know how<br>to explain the concept in a way that will<br>be more helpful to you. There is a good<br>chance that somebody else made the same<br>mistake, so your thinking can help the whole<br>class learn.|



The language in the second column promotes a culture of compliance. Students in grades 2 through 5 are
likely to perceive this as disrespecting their need for autonomy and independent thinking.

The language in the third column promotes a culture of learning because it supports students’ autonomy.
It implies that students can own their thinking and that they deserve valid explanations. This approach can
help students feel respected and cause them to be more motivated and engaged.

**Collaboratively Troubleshooting Student Misconceptions**

It is common for students to make mistakes as they build their understanding of new or difficult concepts.
From a student perspective, mistakes can logically occur whenever students try to apply previous learning to
new problems that require a different approach. To help students correct their thinking and develop a better
understanding, teachers can identify the knowledge that students are building on when they make a mistake.


The _Bluebonnet Learning_ _K–5 Math_ instructional materials list common student mistakes for each module.
Teachers can use this information to troubleshoot mistakes collaboratively with students.


As noted in the Program and Implementation Guide, _collaborative troubleshooting_ is a routine to help
teachers address students’ misconceptions. The three steps to collaborative troubleshooting are


(1) surface student thinking;

(2) validate what the student did right; and

(3) bridge to a better understanding.


In Step 1, it’s helpful to ask questions to better understand what the student was thinking when they made a
decision. For example, the teacher can ask, “Can you tell me more about your thinking on this problem?” or
“I noticed you wrote ____. What were some of your reasons for doing that?”


In Step 2, it’s helpful to point out the parts of the problem that the student understood or did correctly. That
way, the student maintains their successful thinking as they retry a problem. For example, teachers can say
“I noticed you did ____ and wrote ____, and that’s great because that means you understood ____.”


Last, in Step 3, the teacher can build on the student’s assets and bridge to a better understanding. It can help
to ask guided questions that invite the student to build a stronger understanding. For example, the teacher
can ask the following questions:


⬛
“If you keep ____ [correct thinking] and changed ____ [misconception] to ____ [alternative], then
what do you think might happen?”


⬛
“What would happen if you did ____ instead of ____?”


⬛
“If ____ [correct thinking] is true, then how does that thinking affect ____ [misconception]?”


In practice, this routine may look and sound like the following teacher–student dialogue, which is based on a
misconception for Grade 3 Module 5 Topic F that is listed in the Module Overview.

_Note: Teachers can adapt this sample dialogue to other misconceptions listed in the Module Overview._

**Scenario:** A student makes an error comparing the fractions [1]
6



and [1]
8



**Scenario:** A student makes an error comparing the fractions [1] and [1] . The student mistakenly believes [1]
6 8 8

is greater than [1] . The teacher has a one-on-one discussion with the student.
6



. The teacher has a one-on-one discussion with the student.



**Step 1: Surface student thinking.**



T: How did you decide that [1]
8



is greater than [1]
6



?



S: I saw that they are both unit fractions, so I looked at the fractional units. I know 8 is more than 6, so
1 1
is greater than .
8 6
**Step 2: Validate what the student did right.**

T: You are right that 8 is greater than 6 when we are working with whole numbers. Are we using whole
numbers when we compare these two numbers? Read these numbers aloud.
S: 1 eighth. 1 sixth.

**Step 3: Bridge to a better understanding.**



T: Let’s draw two rectangles to model these fractions. Make sure the rectangles are the same size.
S: (Draw rectangles.)
T: Partition the first rectangle into eighths and the second rectangle
into sixths.
S: (Partition.)
T: What do you notice about the number of parts and the size of the
parts in the first rectangle?
S: There are more parts, but they are smaller. 1
T: Model 1 eighth and 1 sixth on the rectangles by shading and labeling. 8
S: (Shade in 1 part of each rectangle and label.)
T: Look at the part that represents 1 sixth and compare it to the part 1
that represents 1 eighth. Which is bigger? 6
S: 1 sixth is bigger.
T: Use the sentence frame ______ is greater than ______ to compare.
S: 1 sixth is greater than 1 eighth.
T: Yes! So even though the whole number 8 is greater than the whole number 6, the fractional unit of
eighths means that the whole is partitioned into more parts. The more parts that the whole has, the
smaller the parts are. Do you think 1 tenth is greater than or less than 1 eighth?
S: Greater than.
T: Why?
S: Because the whole has 10 parts and those would be even smaller than the 8 parts we drew when we
modeled eighths.

**Assessment Reflection Tool**

An assessment reflection can be powerful in helping to surface student thinking and in helping students to
monitor and track their own growth. It can also help students anticipate and process any thoughts they may
have about completing an assessment.

The Assessment Reflection Tool can help teachers guide discussions both prior to and after an assessment.
These discussions help the teacher promote a culture of productive struggle as students go into testing. These
discussions also support students’ needs after testing and give students the opportunity to reflect on their
progress and learn from their mistakes after an assessment.

**Sequence of Grade 3 Modules Aligned with the TEKS**

Module 1: Properties of Multiplication and Division and Solving Problems with Units of 2–5 and 10
Module 2: Place Value and Problem Solving with Units of Measure
Module 3: Multiplication and Division with Units of 0, 1, 6–9, and Multiples of 10
Module 4: Multiplication and Area
Module 5: Fractions as Numbers on the Number Line
Module 6: Financial Literacy and Data
Module 7: Geometry and Measurement Word Problems


**Summary of Year**

Grade 3 mathematics is about (1) extending understanding of place value; (2) developing understanding of
strategies for multiplication and division within 100; (3) developing understanding of fractions, especially the
concept that fractions are numbers on the number line; and (4) describing and analyzing two-dimensional
shapes.


**Rationale for Module Sequence in Grade 3**

The first module builds upon the foundation of multiplicative thinking with units that started in Grade 2. First,
students concentrate on the meaning of multiplication and division and begin developing fluency for learning
products involving factors of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10. The restricted set of facts keeps learning manageable and
provides enough examples for students to solve one- and two-step word problems. The limited set of factors in
Module 1 is also used to introduce students to the commutative and distributive properties of multiplication.

Module 2 focuses on measurement and place value. Students explore measurements of time, weight, and liquid
volume. They develop an understanding of time as a continuous measurement and use different strategies
to solve problems involving addition and subtraction of time intervals. Then, students use scales to measure
the weights of objects, and the weights are recorded in the customary units of ounces and pounds. Next,
students measure liquid volume by using the vertical number line and a graduated beaker. Students then
extend their understanding of place value from Grade 2 to name numbers up to 100,000. They apply their
understanding of place value to compose and decompose numbers, compare numbers, round numbers,
and add and subtract numbers within 1,000. Students also draw proportional strip diagrams to solve word
problems and explain their thinking (e.g., “If this strip represents 62 pounds, then a strip representing
35 pounds needs to be slightly longer than half the strip representing 62 pounds.”). Drawing the relative
sizes of the lengths involved in the model prepares students for Module 5 where they learn to locate and
plot points on the number line relative to each other and relative to the whole unit. Module 2 also provides
students with opportunities to practice the 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 facts as part of their fluency activities.

Students learn the remaining multiplication and division facts in Module 3 as they continue to develop their
understanding of multiplication and division strategies within 100, and then use those strategies to solve
two-step word problems. Students build on their understanding of multiplication as they work with multiples
of 10 and then multiply two-digit numbers by one-digit numbers. Modules 1 and 3 gradually build up to the
area model (the fourth model in the following image), using rectangular arrays in the context of learning
multiplication and division. This necessary work prepares students for representing two-digit by one-digit
multiplication with an area model and building an understanding of area in Module 4.

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 3


Progression from Rectangular Array to Area Model


By Module 4, students are ready to use their understanding of multiplication to determine the area of a
rectangle with whole-number side lengths. First, they measure the area of a shape by finding the total number
of same-size units of area (e.g., tiles) required to cover the shape without gaps or overlaps. Then, students
connect their extensive work with rectangular arrays and multiplication to discover that they can determine
the area of a rectangle by multiplying the number of rows by the number of square units in each row. Finally,
students decompose composite figures into rectangles, determine the area of each rectangle, and then apply
the additive property of area to determine the total area of the figure.

One goal of Module 5 is for students to transition from thinking of fractions as area or parts of a figure to
thinking of fractions as points on a number line, and then finally as numbers. Students start by understanding
that unit fractions are the basic building blocks used to compose non-unit fractions and the whole. Students
transition from representing fractions by using objects, area models, and strip diagrams to representing
fractions on the number line, which helps them understand that fractions are numbers. Students also
compare fractions, find equivalent fractions in special cases, and solve problems that involve fractions.

In Module 6, students build on their understanding of Grade 2 concepts about financial literacy, data, and
graphing. Students start the module by expanding upon familiar skills from Kindergarten through Grade 2 to
count collections of bills and coins. Then, they explore the relationship between human capital and income by
examining income data for various professions. Students also explore the relationship between the availability or
scarcity of resources and how supply and demand can impact cost. Next, students identify and discuss decisions
that involve planned and unplanned spending, saving, borrowing, and charitable giving. Data is presented in
tables and bar graphs for students to analyze and relate to different financial literacy concepts. Students continue
their work with data by representing data in a variety of forms, including scaled pictographs and scaled bar
graphs. Students are also introduced to dot plots as another way to represent data. Finally, students determine
the relationship between pairs of numbers in tables.

The year rounds out with students solving word problems involving the four operations, classifying and sorting
two- and three-dimensional figures, and developing an understanding of perimeter as an attribute of twodimensional shapes in Module 7. The intensive problem solving that students engage in during this module
serves as a culmination of the topics studied throughout the year. The work that students do to sort and
classify shapes includes identifying various attributes of shapes, such as number of sides, parallel sides, and
right angles. Another attribute of two-dimensional shapes that students learn about is perimeter. Students
learn how to calculate the perimeter of a variety of shapes and how to determine an unknown side length,
given the shape’s perimeter and the remaining side lengths. Through extensive work, including data collection,
students understand that there is no relationship in general between the area of a shape and its perimeter.
The Grade 3 year concludes with students solving a variety of word problems involving area and perimeter.

**Grade 3 Development of Fluency**
**Overview**

Fluency activities are designed to promote automaticity and flexibility by engaging students in ways that build
fluency from conceptual understanding. The fluency activities in each lesson provide students with strategic
learning opportunities to develop their proficiency with specific TEKS. While all TEKS are included in the
instructional materials, some TEKS may not be practiced in a fluency activity.

**Fluency Year-at-a-Glance**

For specific TEKS descriptions and student expectations, refer to the relevant Fluency Close-Up tables.

Grade 3 Module 1
###### **Tips for Families**

**Key Concepts Overview**

Focus TEKS: **3.4D, 3.4E, 3.4F, 3.4H, 3.4J, 3.4K, 3.5A, 3.5B, 3.5D**

The focus of Module 1 is building conceptual understanding of multiplication and division with units of 2–5
and 10, exploring the relationship between multiplication and division, and solving word problems. Your
student will:

⬜ Identify the **number of groups** and the **size of each group** in an **array** .

⬜ Write **multiplication** equations using an array.

⬜ **Divide** objects into **equal groups** or show how many objects are in a group.

⬜ Solve word problems with **unknown** **factors** and find the **quotient** .

⬜ Show understanding of the **commutative property** and the break apart and **distribute** strategy and
solve word problems involving these two strategies.

⬜ Solve word problems involving the two different types of division problems (determine the size of the
group or determine the number of groups).

⬜ Solve multiplication and division problems that use **units** of 2–5 and 10.

⬜ Break apart arrays and number bonds into smaller multiplication and division problems using the
break apart and distribute strategy.

⬜ Solve two-step word problems using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and/or division.

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages
in the Succeed Student Edition to help you support your student as they work at home.


**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Place various objects into arrays in your daily life, such as crackers on a plate, crayons, or toys that
your student may have. Say to him, “How many rows are there? How many objects are in each row?
Let’s skip-count the rows to find the total.”


⬛
With your student, arrange objects (such as small snack foods like crackers, fruit snacks, grapes, or
pretzels) into arrays. Then ask her to write two multiplication and two division equations that the
array could represent. For example, display 4 rows of 3 grapes. The student could write 4 × 3 = 12,
3 × 4 = 12, 12 ÷ 3 = 4 and 12 ÷ 4 = 3.


⬛
Ask your student to arrange objects into an array with one larger factor, such as 8 × 3. Then have
him break the array into two smaller parts and write a multiplication sentence for each of the parts.
For example, he could separate 8 × 3 into the more manageable parts of (5 × 3) + (3 × 3). 5 × 3 = 15,
3 × 3 = 9, and 15 + 9 = 24. Therefore, 8 × 3 = 24.

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 3



⬛
Continue to practice multiplication and division equations from memory with
factors of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10. Have your student cut several triangles out of paper.
Think of a multiplication or division fact. In each triangle, write two factors and
their product (one number per corner). Ask her to state two multiplication and
two division equations relating the numbers on each triangle. Cover one number
with your thumb and ask her to figure out what number is hidden.

**Formas Adicionales De Ayudar En Casa**


⬛
Coloque varios objetos en matrices en su vida diaria, como galletas en un plato, crayones o juguetes
que su estudiante pueda tener. Diga: “¿Cuántas filas hay? ¿Cuántos objetos hay en cada fila? Vamos a
contar las filas para encontrar el total”.


⬛
Con su estudiante, coloque objetos (snacks pequeños como galletas saladas, bocadillos de frutas,
uvas o pretzels) en matrices. Luego, pídale que escriba dos ecuaciones de multiplicación y dos de
división que la matriz pueda representar. Por ejemplo, muestre 4 filas de 3 uvas. El estudiante podría
escribir 4 × 3 = 12, 3 × 4 = 12, 12 ÷ 3 = 4 y 12 ÷ 4 = 3.


⬛
Pídale a su estudiante que organice los objetos en una matriz con un factor más grande, como 8 × 3.
Luego, pídale que divida la matriz en dos partes más pequeñas y escriba una oración de multiplicación para cada una de las partes. Por ejemplo, podría separar 8 × 3 en las partes más manejables
de (5 × 3) + (3 × 3). 5 × 3 = 15, 3 × 3 = 9 y 15 + 9 = 24. Por lo tanto, 8 × 3 = 24.

**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Continue to practice multiplication and division, including all facts up to 9s, from memory. Focus on
the problems that your student needs more practice with. Use car rides, shopping trips, or other
“in-between” times to have her exercise her math muscles.


⬛
Have your student use cereal, small candies, stickers, or small toys to construct an array that represents multiplying by 6, 7, 8, or 9, such as 9 × 2. Then ask him to separate the array after the fifth
column. Next ask him to write and solve two smaller multiplication problems that would show how
many total objects are in the larger array. So 9 × 2 = (5 × 2) + (4 × 2). 9 × 2 = 10 + 8. 9 × 2 = 18.


⬛
Play a memory match game with multiplication and division. Use note cards or paper to make two
sets of cards. On the cards, write the expression for multiplication and division facts that your student needs more practice with, but do not include the answer. Then make a second set of cards
showing the answers that match the expressions. Lay the expression set of cards on one side and the
answer set on the other side. Players take turns turning over two cards at a time to see whether the


**48**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 3


cards match a multiplication or division fact with its correct answer. If no match is made, the cards
are turned face down. If a match is made, the player keeps the two cards. For example, if your student turns over one card that shows 8 × 7 and another showing 63, a match was not made. She must
turn the cards facedown because 8 × 7 = 56, not 63. However, if she turns over cards showing 9 and
63 ÷ 7, she keeps both cards because 9 is the correct answer for the division expression. Continue
until all the cards in the array have been matched. The player with the most cards at the end of the
game is the winner.

Jueguen a un juego de memoria con multiplicación y división. Use tarjetas o papel para hacer dos
juegos de tarjetas. En las tarjetas, escriba la expresión para las operaciones de multiplicación y
división con las que su estudiante necesita más práctica, pero no incluya la respuesta. Luego, haga
un segundo conjunto de tarjetas que muestren las respuestas que coincidan con las expresiones.
Coloque el conjunto de tarjetas de expresión en un lado y el conjunto de respuestas en el otro lado.
Los jugadores deben turnarse para girar dos cartas a la vez para ver si las cartas coinciden con un
factor de multiplicación o división con su respuesta correcta. Si no se hace ninguna coincidencia, las
cartas se giran boca abajo. Si se hace una coincidencia, el jugador se queda con las dos cartas. Por
ejemplo, si su estudiante gira una tarjeta que muestra 8 × 7 y otra que muestra 63, no se hizo una
coincidencia. Debe poner las cartas boca abajo porque 8 × 7 = 56, no 63. Sin embargo, si da la vuelta
a las cartas que muestran 9 y 63 ÷ 7, se queda con ambas cartas porque 9 es la respuesta correcta
para la expresión de división. Continúe hasta que se hayan relacionado todas las cartas de la matriz.
El jugador con más cartas al final del juego es el ganador.
