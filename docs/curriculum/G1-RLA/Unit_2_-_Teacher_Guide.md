##### Introduction


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching _The Human_
_Body_ unit. The Teacher Guide for _The Human Body_ contains ten daily lessons in addition to six
days for a Pausing Point (two days), Unit Review, Unit Assessment, and Culminating Activities (two
days) in the order presented in this Teacher Guide. You should spend no more than sixteen days
total on this unit.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


At the back of this Teacher Guide, you will find a section titled “Teacher Resources.” In this section
you will find the following:


  - Activity Book Answer Key


  - Measures of Text Complexity


  - Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Correlation Chart


  - English Language Proficiency Standards Correlation Chart


~~**UNIT COMPONENTS**~~


Along with this Teacher Guide, you will need:


  - Flip Book for _The Human Body_


  - Image Cards for _The Human Body_


  - Activity Book for _The Human Body_


  - Digital Components for _The Human Body_


All unit components’ materials can also be found in the digital version provided with the online materials.


~~**WHY THE HUMAN BODY IS IMPORTANT**~~


Using an interactive approach, the first half of this unit will introduce the human body to students.
They will explore and make discoveries about their own bodies. They will be introduced to a network
of body systems, comprised of organs that, together, perform vital jobs. Students will learn the
fundamental parts and functions of five body systems: skeletal, muscular, digestive, circulatory,
and nervous. The narrator of these Read-Alouds, a pediatrician, will share rhymes that reinforce
basic ideas about the human body that students will learn.


The second half of this unit focuses on care and maintenance of the human body. Students will
learn how germs can cause disease, and how to help stop the spread of germs. They will be


Introduction

**2**



introduced to Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur, whose discoveries aided in the cure of diseases.
Students will be taught five keys to good health—eat well, exercise, sleep, keep clean, and have
regular checkups. By using the food pyramid and MyPlate to create their own meals, students
will also learn the importance of a well-balanced diet. This unit will provide students with the
rudimentary lessons they need to develop healthy habits. They will review and extend their learning
in future grades.


This unit also provides opportunities for students to build content knowledge and draw connections
to the science subject area. You may build on class discussions to support students in making
cross-curricular connections to the strands of Organisms and Environments and Recurring Themes
and Concepts from the Science TEKS. For more information about the quantitative and qualitative
measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in
the Teacher Resources.


**Note to Teacher**


The discussion on germs and vaccines in Lesson 7 may be a sensitive topic for some students who have
faced uncertainty or loss due to infectious diseases or viruses. Please be sure to follow your school’s
best practices and update lesson language based on your knowledge of student circumstances. Due
to this unit’s focus on the human body, there are representations of the body and bodily functions that
might raise sensitivity flags.


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED DURING KINDERGARTEN**~~


The following unit, and the specific core content that was targeted in that unit, is particularly
relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _The Human Body_ . This background knowledge will
greatly enhance students’ understanding of the Read-Alouds they are about to enjoy:


**The Five Senses (Kindergarten)**


~~**CORE CONTENT OBJECTIVES ADDRESSED IN THIS UNIT**~~


Students will:


 - Explain that the human body is a network of systems


 - Identify the skeletal, muscular, digestive, circulatory, and nervous systems


 - Recall basic facts about the skeletal, muscular, digestive, circulatory, and nervous systems


 - Explain that the heart is a muscle integral to the circulatory system


 - Identify the brain as the body’s control center


 - Explain that germs can cause disease in the body


 - Explain the importance of vaccination in preventing disease


 - Explain the importance of exercise, cleanliness, a balanced diet, and rest for bodily health


Unit 2 The Human Body


~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR THE HUMAN BODY**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _The Human Body_ in the forms in which
they appear in the Read-Alouds. Bold-faced words in the list have an associated Word Work activity.
The inclusion of the words on this list does not mean that students are immediately expected to be
able to use all of these words on their own. However, through repeated exposure throughout the
lessons, they should understand most of these words and begin to use them in conversation.

~~**WRITING**~~









In this unit, students will explore the genre of informational writing. They will learn to identify
important facts and information before, during, and after informational Read-Alouds. They will
practice collecting and synthesizing information by note-taking as a group with a KWL chart and
a Somebody Wanted But So Then organizer. Students will work independently to draw and write
or dictate one-sentence responses about Read-Alouds in Lessons 2–6. These will be combined
to form a booklet. Finally, as a class, students will review the writing process and draft an
informational paragraph about the five body systems (Lessons 1–5).


The following activities may be added to students’ writing portfolios to showcase student writing
within and across units:


Introduction
**3**


**4**




  - “My Body Systems” Booklets (Lessons 2–6)


  - Germs (Lesson 7)


  - Five Keys to Health (Lesson 8)


  - Body Systems (Lesson 10)


  - Any additional writing completed during Pausing Point, Unit Review, or Culminating Activities


~~**FOUNDATIONAL ORAL LANGUAGE**~~


Across the unit and the grade level, students will have the opportunity to discuss their ideas with
partners, in small groups, and as a class. The Think-Pair-Share and Turn-and-Talk prompts provide
opportunities to teach and reinforce how to communicate by using conventions of language,
speaking when recognized, and making appropriate contributions to discussion.


 - You can also reinforce these ideas by modeling using an appropriate pace, recognizing
students’ individual contributions to group discussions, and pointing out conventions of
language.


 - Explain to students that when working in whole/small groups, group members share
responsibility for the work they do together. To work effectively and respectfully, everyone
should recognize the contributions made by each group member. For example, as group
members discuss a text, each group member can share thoughts and reactions. If preparing
to return to a whole-group discussion, group members can summarize the group’s ideas by
including contributions from everyone in the group.


 - Practice this by choosing a simple topic for discussion, and model sharing responsibility and
recognizing individual and appropriate contributions, including hand-raising when wanting to
speak and using learned conventions for language (articulation, grammar, verb tenses, etc.)
Remind students what these contributions and conventions refer to in terms of speech and
communication and why they are important to master. Consider using a discussion checklist
that tracks student participation, as well as introducing discussion techniques that enhance
~~**TEKS 1.1.C; TEKS 1.1.D**~~ ~~participation.~~


**TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using the conventions of language; **TEKS**
**1.1.D** Work collaboratively with others by following agreed-upon rules for discussion, including listening to others, speaking when recognized, and making appropriate contributions.

**Speaking and Listening:** Students will review what they know about how their
bodies work and be introduced to the concept of a pediatrician.


~~**TEKS 1.1.A; TEKS 1.7.F**~~


~~**UNIT INTRODUCTION (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that for the next few weeks they will learn about their own
bodies and how they work. Explain to them that their bodies are like
complicated machines made up of many different parts. Some parts are
visible, while others are hidden from view, located inside their bodies.


  - Refer to the KWL chart you prepared in advance. Explain to students that
throughout the unit you will use this chart to note what students already
know (K), what they wonder (W), and what they have learned (L) about how
their bodies work.


  - Tell students today they will fill out the ‘K’ column of the chart as a class, and
that throughout the unit they will go back to consider things they would like
to know more about (W) and to recall what they learned in the Read- Alouds
(L).


  - Give students the opportunity to share anything they already know about
how their bodies work. As students respond, repeat and expand upon each
response using richer and more complex language, including, if possible any
Read-Aloud vocabulary. Record students’ responses in the ‘K’ column of the
KWL chart. If a student’s response includes inaccurate information, record
it nonetheless and acknowledge the response by saying something like, “So
you think that your heart is shaped like a Valentine heart? We’ll have to listen
very carefully to our Read-Alouds and find out if that’s true!” ~~**TEKS 1.7.F**~~


**TEKS 1.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and answer questions using multi-word responses;
**TEKS 1.7.F** Respond using newly acquired vocabulary as appropriate.

~~**WHAT DO WE ALREADY KNOW? (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain to students that most of the time their bodies work well, but that
sometimes, just like machines, they stop working correctly. Brainstorm
solutions for repairing broken machines.


 - You might ask one of the following questions:


   - Whom would you call if your car wouldn’t start?


   - Whom would you call if your telephone made funny sounds?


   - Whom would you call if your washing machine overflowed?


 - Then ask:


   - Whom would you call if you had a very high fever or a terrible tummy ache?


 - Explain that there are people with different specialities (dentists for teeth,
ophthalmologist for eyes, dietitian for nutritional health, etc.). Then tell
students that the type of doctor who cares especially for children is called a
pediatrician.


**Show Image 1A-1: Meet Dr. Welbody**

 - Point to the picture of Dr. Welbody. Explain to students that Dr. Welbody is a
pediatrician. Tell them that she takes care of sick children but that she also
knows lots of ways to help children stay well so that they won’t get sick too
often. She is going to help them understand their bodies.


 - Explain to students that asking questions is one way to better understand
the information. Model for students by asking a question about pediatricians.


 - Invite students to ask questions that they may have to better understand the
role and work of a pediatrician.


Check for Understanding


**Think-Share:** Why might you visit a pediatrician? _(Answers may_
_vary, but may include to get help to feel better.)_

  - Tell students to listen carefully to find out what is in their bodies beneath
their skin that keeps them alive and healthy.

  - Remind students to use the information and illustrations in the text to help
them understand word meanings. ~~**TEKS 1.3.B**~~

  - Explain that a doctor named Dr. Welbody will be telling us about the human
body. She will use words like “I” and “me” to show that she is telling about her
own experiences. ~~**TEKS 1.10.E**~~


~~**“EVERYBODY HAS A BODY” (15 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.3.B; TEKS 1.10.E**~~


**Show Image 1A-1: Meet Dr. Welbody**

Pleased to meet you. I’m Dr. Welbody, the

rhyming pediatrician. Being a pediatrician is

my job. That means that I am a medical doctor

who takes care of children. When healthy

children come to me for checkups, I help them





stay healthy. When sick children come to me,

I help them get better. I know how to do these



things because I studied very hard in medical school, the kind of school you

go to if you want to be a doctor. I learned all about how the **human** body

works. ~~Human~~ ~~_means having the characteristics of, or acting like, a person._~~

As for rhyming, that is my hobby. Do you like rhyming, too? I think it is fun

to make up rhymes. ~~_Who is telling us about the human body, and how do you_~~

~~_know?_~~ ~~(Dr. Welbody, a pediatrician. She uses “I” to show that she is the one~~

~~talking.)~~


**TEKS 1.10.E** Listen to and experience first- and third-person texts; **TEKS 1.9.D.i** Recognize characteristics and structures of
informational text including the central idea and supporting evidence with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and
texts the student is able to read or hear to learn or clarify word meanings.


Lesson 1 Everybody Has a Body
**11**


Challenge


Ask students what other
types of bodies they can
think of aside from the
human body.


Support


Organs are also musical
instruments that have
keyboards, similar to a
piano.


**12**



Here’s one I made up about my favorite subject, the human body:


**Show Image 1A-2: Dr. Welbody**


_Everybody has a body_
_And I have one, too._
_It is grand to understand_
_The things our bodies do._





Now you say it with me. ~~_[Ask students to echo_~~

~~_each line after you as you repeat the rhyme.]_~~


**Show Image 1A-3: Diverse people**


~~_What do you see in this picture?_~~

The human body truly is an amazing thing.

Some parts of a human are on the outside

where we can see them. What parts of your

body can you see? What parts of the children

sitting near you can you see? ~~_[Pause for_~~

~~_answers.]_~~ You can probably see skin, hair,



faces, and fingernails. Skin comes in different colors. Hair does, too. Hair

may be curly, wavy, or straight. Eyes may be brown, blue, or green. People are

also different sizes and different ages, too.


~~**TEKS 1.3.B**~~

**Show Image 1A-4: Diagram of the**
**human body**

Although people may look somewhat different from

one another on the outside, on the inside, all humans

are pretty much alike. All humans have **organs**, such

as stomachs and intestines, inside them. ~~_[Point_~~





~~_to the diagram.] This is one meaning of the word_~~

~~organs~~ ~~_._~~ The organs work together in **systems** to



keep each person alive and healthy. ~~_A system is a group of organs working together._~~

For example, the stomach and intestines are part of the digestive system, which

breaks down the food you eat so it can be absorbed and used by the body. During

our time together, I am going to teach you about the skeletal system, the muscular

system, the digestive system, the circulatory system, and the nervous system.

These systems allow you to grow, move, think, hear, see, feel, and speak. They also

enable your body to breathe air, digest food, and even heal itself. And the systems

are all tied together into a **network** that is called the human body.


**TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and texts the student is able to read or hear to learn or clarify word meanings.


Unit 2 The Human Body


~~_[Uncover the diagram you prepared in advance that has three concentric circles._~~

~~_Point to the appropriate parts as you read the next sentence.]_~~ So the human

body is a network of different systems that work together; each system is made

up of certain organs that help it do a special job.


**Show Image 1A-5: Skin**

The outside of your body is covered by skin,

the body’s biggest organ. Your skin keeps your

“insides” inside you. Your skin grows with you.

It stretches when you move and keeps out dirt

and water. It keeps you cool in the heat and













warm in the cold. You can feel things with your

skin. If you cut yourself, your skin will mend

itself. Pretty amazing! ~~_Put your finger on your_~~

~~_body’s biggest organ. (skin)_~~


**Show Image 1A-6: Diagram of the human**
**body**

The organs and systems that keep the body

working are mostly hidden inside the body where

we can’t see them. Almost everything inside a

human has a purpose. Touch your tummy. ~~_[Model_~~

~~_for students, and pause until all students are_~~

~~_engaged.]_~~ Inside your tummy, the stomach and



the small intestine break down and absorb food. Other nearby organs, the large

intestine, liver, and the kidneys, help clean out waste.


Now put your hands on your chest. ~~_[Demonstrate as before.]_~~ The lungs are inside

your chest. They are the organs that take in air when you breathe. Take a deep

breath. When you do this, your lungs are filling up with air like balloons and your

chest rises. ~~_What happens to your chest when you breathe out? (Your chest falls.)_~~

We need **oxygen** from this air to stay alive. The oxygen from the air you breathe

goes into your blood. Then your heart pumps the blood with oxygen to all parts of

your body.


Now, put your hands on your head. Inside your head is your brain. The brain

Lesson 1 Everybody Has a Body
**13**


**Show Image 1A-7: Meet Dr. Welbody**

In our time together we are going to learn

fascinating facts about the body such as:


- how many bones you have;


- which muscle is the biggest in your body;


- why food that you ate two days ago is still in
your body today;




- how long it takes for your blood to circle all around your body;


- what controls your five senses;


- and much, much more. I hope you are as excited as I am.


**Show Image 1A-8: Dr. Welbody**

Now, before I go, let’s say the body rhyme

together again: ~~_[Ask students to echo each line_~~

~~_after you.]_~~





_Everybody has a body,_
_And I have one, too._
_It is grand to understand_
_The things our bodies do._



Okay, then—bye until next time!

Unit 2 The Human Body


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


As students answer the following questions, add relevant information to the
‘L’ column of the KWL chart.


1. **Literal.** Name some of the things that are hidden inside your bodies.
_(stomach, small intestine, liver, kidneys, lungs, skull, brain, muscles, nerves,_
_bones, blood)_


2. **Literal.** The human body is made up of organs. Most of your organs are
inside your body, but the body’s biggest organ is on the outside, covering all
the other organs. What is this organ called? _(skin)_


3. **Inferential.** How are organs different from systems in the body? _(Organs_
_are body parts that perform specific tasks. Systems are groups of organs that_
_work together in the human body.)_ [Help students recall examples of organs
and systems from the Read-Aloud, such as the skin, stomach, or lungs, and
have them explain how one part helps the body work.]


Check for Understanding ~~**TEKS 1.10.E**~~


**Think-Pair-Share:** Remind students that this text is in the words
of a doctor who knows all about the human body. Dr. Welbody
explained that the human body is a network of systems. How do the
parts of this network make your body work? _(Answers may vary.)_


4. After today’s Read-Aloud and questions and answers, do you have any
remaining questions? [As students answer this question, add relevant ideas
and questions to the ‘W’ column of the KWL chart. If time permits, you may
wish to allow for individual, group, or class research of the text and/or other
resources to answer these remaining questions.]


**TEKS 1.10.E** Listen to and experience first- and third-person texts.

~~**WORD WORK: SYSTEMS (5 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.3.B**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “The organs work together in systems to keep
each person alive and healthy.”


2. Say the word _systems_ with me.


3. Systems are groups of organs that work together in the human body.


4. The human body is made up of a network of systems.


5. You now know that the systems in your body allow you to do many things.
Can you think of some things the systems in your body allow you to do? Try
to use the word _system_ ( _s_ ) when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students.
If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses: “The system(s)
in my body allow me to . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Multiple-Meaning activity for follow-up.** The word _system_ can
also refer to groups of things that perform the same job together for our
community. For example, our school is one of many schools. It is part of a
school system. I am going to give you clues and ask you to tell me what kind
of a system I am describing. Be sure to use the word _system_ in your answers

five copies of Activity Page 2.1 between two sheets of construction paper.


  - Display the “My Body Systems” paragraph on chart paper that you began in
Lesson 1.


**Notes to Teacher**


The goal of the “My Body Systems” booklet activity for Lesson 2 is for students
to become more aware of the details of the skeletal system through the activity
of drawing it, so they need not draw a perfect depiction of the skeleton. Later
in the unit, when students’ knowledge of the body’s systems is assessed, they
will be asked to recognize, rather than draw, the various systems.

**Show Image 2A-1: Dr. Welbody showing**

**skeleton**

Did you think a **skeleton** was just a scary thing

you might see in a movie or on Halloween?

Well, I, Dr. Welbody, am here to tell you that

there is a lot more to a skeleton than that. We





are about to explore some facts about your

skeleton and mine. That’s right—we all have



skeletons hidden underneath our skin. A person’s skeleton is made up of

bones—about 206 in all. ~~_Is this number more or less than what you thought?_~~

If you did not have a hard skeleton like this to **support** you, ~~_or hold you up,_~~

your body would be as soft and floppy as a rag doll’s.


Feel your arm. ~~_[Pause, modeling for students until all are engaged.]_~~ That hard

thing inside is a bone. ~~_Does your skeleton support your body or make your_~~

~~_body soft and floppy?_~~


**Show Image 2A-2: Skeleton protecting organs**

Bones give your body shape and protect the

softer parts of you. If you touch the sides of

your chest you can feel the bones called ribs.






~~_[Pause while students feel their ribs. Point to_~~



**TEKS 1.6.B** Generate questions about text before, during, and after reading to deepen understanding and gain information with

Support


Steel is a very strong
kind of metal used to
build buildings. Bones
are so strong they are
stronger than steel even
though they are filled with
marrow, which is light and
spongy.


**26**



~~_the rib cage in the image.]_~~ They look something like bars on a cage. In fact, that

part of your body is called your rib cage. It protects your heart and lungs. Now

tap lightly on your head to feel the bone called your **skull** . It is like a helmet

made of flat bones, and it protects your brain. Bones are amazing! Did you

know that one bone inside your ear is as small as a grain of rice?


**Show Image 2A-3: Spongy bone**

Your bones are not very heavy because they

are filled with a light, spongy material called

marrow. Yet they are stronger than steel. And if

you break a bone, the broken ends will heal by

growing together again. Isn’t that amazing?


**Show Image 2A-4: Joints**

A **joint** is a place where two bones meet or join

together. Bones cannot bend. But at a joint,

the bones connect in ways that let us move

and bend our bodies. Stand up and try bending

your knees. Now stand up straight again. Do





this a few times. Did you notice how your

knees moved forward and back like hinges on



a door? But your knees cannot bend in the other direction. That is how your

knee joint works. ~~_[Once students are seated again, point to and define each_~~

~~_of the joints pictured.]_~~ Your hip joint is at the place where the top of your leg

meets your body. Your hip joint is like a ball on the end of one bone that fits

into a socket (an opening in the shape of a bowl) on another. It lets you move

your leg up and down and turn it so that you can kick, walk, run and jump.


Now, touch your wrist. ~~_[Pause until all students are engaged.]_~~ It contains lots

of tiny bones and different sorts of joints. These joints let you draw, write,

and throw a ball. Can you find other places in your body where there are

joints? ~~_[Pause for suggestions (e.g., elbow, shoulder, ankle, fingers.)]_~~


Unit 2 The Human Body


Poster 2M





**Show Image 2A-5: Spine**

Run your hand down the middle of your back.

Do you feel the line of small bones that runs

up and down it? Those small bones are called

vertebrae. Joints are found in between each

vertebra. Together they let you bend and twist

your body in different directions. Taken all

together, the vertebrae make up your **spine** .



~~_The spine is the column of bones that forms your backbone._~~ Your spine covers

your spinal cord which is part of another system that we will learn about later.


**Show Image 2A-6: Dr. Welbody’s skeleton**

Your amazing skeletal system is made up of

bones that are linked together to support your

body, give you shape, protect your organs, and

help you move. Would you like to hear a rhyme

about my skeleton? Here goes:





_Without my hidden skeleton,_
_I could not stand up tall._
_And so, “Hurray for bones,” I say,_
_Two hundred six in all!_


Let’s say it all together now. ~~_[Ask students to echo each line after you.]_~~


That’s all for now. But before I go, let me see each of you stand up and move

your skeleton! ~~_[Pause until all students are engaged.]_~~ Wow! Tomorrow, we are

going to learn about another system that works with your skeletal system to

help you move. See you next time!

1. **Inferential.** Why do you have a skeleton? _(to support you, give your body_
_shape, help with movement of the body, and protect important organs)_


2. **Literal.** Your skull bones are located in your head. What do they protect?
_(brain)_


3. **Literal.** Joints connect your bones to help you bend. Can you name some
places in your body where joints are located? _(knees, elbows, hips, shoulders,_
_ankles, wrists, fingers, toes)_


4. **Literal.** Your spine is made up of bones called vertebrae. Where is your
spine? _(down your back)_


5. **Evaluative.** The title of this Read-Aloud is “The Body’s Framework.” Now that
you know what the skeleton does, why do you think the skeleton is called a
framework? _(Answers may vary. Help students draw the analogy between_
_beams that hold up a house and bones that hold up their bodies.)_


6. After today’s Read-Aloud and questions and answers, do you have any
remaining questions? [As students answer this question, add relevant ideas

4. The training wheels support my brother’s bike, keeping the bike from falling
over.


5. Think of something that supports people or things. Try to use the word
_support_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses: “The framework of a house
supports it.”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?

~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED? (10 MIN.)**~~



10M




- Remind students that Dr. Welbody, the rhyming pediatrician, is teaching
them about several systems at work within their bodies. Each system is
made up of different organs that do special jobs for the human body. The
systems are all tied together in a network to keep the human body alive and
healthy.


- Ask students to share what they learned from the previous Read-Aloud about
the skeletal system. Remind students to speak clearly when sharing what
they have learned. You may wish to use a model skeleton to point out the
features being discussed.


Check for Understanding


Students will stand up when they hear the correct answer.


**Stand Up/Sit Down:** Are the following body parts in the skeletal system?

    - mouth _(sit down)_

muscular system.


Unit 2 The Human Body


**Lesson 3: Marvelous Moving Muscles**
30M
##### Read-Aloud


**Reading** : Students will describe the connection between the muscular system and
the skeletal system.


~~**TEKS 1.6.A; TEKS 1.6.E; TEKS 1.6.F**~~


**Language** : Students will demonstrate understanding of the Tier 2 word _voluntary_ .


~~**TEKS 1.3.B**~~


~~**PURPOSE FOR LISTENING**~~


  - Tell students to listen carefully to learn how the muscular system works with
the skeletal system to make your body move.


~~**“MARVELOUS MOVING MUSCLES” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 3A-1: Dr. Welbody, flexing her biceps**

Hi everyone! It’s Dr. Welbody, the rhyming

pediatrician, back to talk about the human

body. Did you figure out what we’re going

to talk about this time? ~~_[Pause for student_~~

~~_responses.]_~~ That’s right! **Muscles** ! Your





muscles help your body move, so you can

walk, breathe, swallow, speak, and do many



other things. Together your muscles make up your muscular system.


**Show Image 3A-2: Muscular system**

There are 650 muscles in your body. ~~_Who_~~

~~_remembers how many bones we have in our_~~

~~_skeleton?_~~ ~~_(206) Do we have more bones or_~~

~~_more muscles in our bodies?_~~ ~~_(muscles)_~~ ~~S~~ ome

muscles are big, like the ones in your legs. Some





are small, like the ones in your face. Muscles

crisscross the body so you can move in many



ways. Muscles move by contracting (or getting shorter) and then relaxing (or

getting longer). ~~_[Ask students to feel their biceps muscles contract/shorten as_~~

~~_they flex them and then relax/lengthen as they extend their arms.]_~~

Lesson 3 Marvelous Moving Muscles
**37**


Support


Remind students that
a system is a group of
organs working together.


Challenge


Ask students what other
parts of the body work in
pairs.


**38**





**Show Image 3A-3: Three views of the knee**

**Tendons** are part of your muscular system.

Feel behind your knee. ~~_[Pause until all_~~

~~_students are engaged.]_~~ There are some strong

rope- like bands under the skin. They are

called tendons. ~~_[Have students repeat the word_~~

~~tendons~~ ~~_with you.]_~~ Tendons are cords that

attach your muscles to your bones.


**Show Image 3A-4: Arm muscles at work**

The muscles that move your bones are called

your skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscles are

**voluntary** muscles. That is because you control

them with your brain by thinking. Pretend that

you are throwing a ball. Your brain tells your

arm muscles to move back first and then move

forward. At the same time, your brain is telling

your hand muscles when to grasp the ball and

when to let it go.



Two muscles often work together, in a pair, to move bones. Touch the top of

your upper arm. ~~_[Pause until all students are engaged. Point to the biceps and_~~

~~_triceps muscles in the picture as students find their own.]_~~ That is where your

biceps muscle is found. Now touch the underside of your arm. That is where

the triceps muscle is located. When you threw that pretend ball just now, the

biceps muscles bent your elbows. The triceps straightened your elbows.


**Show Image 3A-5: Muscles in the hand**

The muscles of your hand and arm work

together in many ways. They help you make

tiny, exact movements like picking a crumb

up off the table. And they are there for you,

too, when you need great strength, like doing





a handstand. The most movable part of your

hand is your thumb. Try wiggling yours. It can

move in many different directions, more than

any of your other fingers.


Unit 2 The Human Body


**Show Image 3A-6: Child smiling widely**

~~_What do you see in this picture?_~~


There are many muscles in your face, mostly

attached to your skin. Did you know that you

need muscles to help you laugh, frown, or even

raise your eyebrows? All the muscles we’ve

talked about so far are voluntary, meaning you

have to decide when to move them.



Other muscles in your body are **involuntary** . That means that you don’t

have to think about telling these muscles to move; they do it automatically.

Involuntary muscles keep your blood flowing and your food moving through

your body. Think about these two actions your body does: kicking a ball and

blinking your eyes. Which do you think is voluntary and which is involuntary?

Can you tell me why? ~~_[Pause for student responses.]_~~


**Show Image 3A-7: Heart**

~~_What is an organ? (a body part that performs_~~

~~_a specific function, such as the stomach or_~~

~~_kidneys) What organ do you see in this picture?_~~


Do you have to tell your heart to beat, or does

Ask students to recall
what system they learned
about that works with
the muscular system to
help the body move. _(the_
_skeletal system)_





it work automatically on its own? ~~_[Pause for_~~

~~_student responses.]_~~ Your heart is another

kind of involuntary muscle. It is called cardiac



muscle. This thick, powerful muscle contracts and relaxes over and over

and over again on its own without stopping. It pumps the blood all around

your body, once every minute! Your heart is a very important muscle that is

necessary for your body to live.


Do you want to know which muscle is the largest muscle in your body? Here’s

a hint: You are probably sitting on it right now! It is your gluteus maximus, or

buttock muscle. You have two of them, one on each side.

Now, since our time together is coming to a

close for today, here is a goodbye rhyme from

Dr. Welbody, the rhyming pediatrician (that’s

me):





Support


Tell students that the
saying “we’ll have a lot to
chew on” means we’ll have
a lot to think about.


**40**



_I’m glad that I have muscles._

_They help me to have fun,_

_To jump and kick a soccer ball,_

_To smile and speak and run._


_I’m glad that I have muscles,_

_And glad that you do, too,_

_So you can wave goodbye to me_

_And I can wave to you!_


When we meet next time, we’ll have a lot to chew on. That’s a clue to what

system of the body we’ll be learning about. Can you guess what it is? ~~_[Pause_~~

~~_for suggestions.]_~~ See you again soon!


Unit 2 The Human Body


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


As students answer the following questions, add relevant information to the
‘L’ column of the KWL chart.


1. **Literal.** What do the muscles that make up your muscular system help your
body do? _(move)_


2. **Literal.** Tendons are rope-like bands under the skin. What two things do they
join together? _(muscles and bones)_

   - **Inferential.** Which two systems use tendons to work together to help the
body move? _(muscular and skeletal)_


3. **Inferential.** How do the muscles in your face help you communicate with
others? _(The muscles in your face help you smile, frown, laugh, raise your_
_eyebrows, etc.)_


4. **Inferential.** What is the difference between voluntary and involuntary
muscles? _(A person must decide to move voluntary muscles, but involuntary_
_muscles work on their own.)_


Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** How does the muscular system help the
skeletal system? _(The muscular system helps move your bones;_
_tendons attach muscles to bones; the muscles that move your_
_bones are skeletal muscles; and skeletal muscles are voluntary,_
_meaning you can control them.)_

2. Say the word _voluntary_ with me.


3. _Voluntary_ means done by choice.


4. My decision to wear a coat today was a voluntary decision.


5. Tell about something that you did that was voluntary, or something you
chose to do. Try to use the word _voluntary_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or
three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses:
“My decision to eat my apple at lunch was a voluntary decision.”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use an Antonyms activity for follow-up.** _Involuntary_ is the opposite of
_voluntary_ . _Voluntary_ means you think about doing something and make a
choice to do it. _Involuntary_ means something that is happening without
your thinking about it or something you do not choose to do. If the things
I say sound voluntary, say, “That is voluntary.” If something I say sounds
involuntary, say, “That is involuntary.”


   - swinging a bat to hit a ball _(That is voluntary.)_

~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED? (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that Dr. Welbody, the rhyming pediatrician, has been
teaching them about various systems at work within their body. Each system
is made up of different organs or parts that do special jobs for the human
body. The systems are all tied together in a network to keep the human body
alive and healthy.


  - Ask students to share what they have learned so far about the skeletal system
and muscular system. You may prompt discussion with the following questions:


    - What does the skeletal system do for the human body? _(provides support as_
_a framework; helps with movement of the body; protects important organs)_


    - Name some bones that make up the skeletal system. _(Answers may vary.)_


    - Give an example of a bone that protects an organ. _(skull protects brain; ribs_
_protect heart and lungs, etc.)_


    - What makes it possible for you to bend your body in different places? _(joints)_


    - What system works with the skeletal system to help you move your body?
_(muscular system)_


    - Tendons are cords under the skin. What two things do they join together?
_(muscles and bones)_


    - Remember, you control voluntary muscles with your brain by thinking.
Point to a voluntary muscle, and tell me what you can use it to do.
_(Answers may vary, but may include arm muscles, hand muscles, muscles_
_in your face.)_


    - What is the most important muscle in your body that needs to
keep working for you to live? Hint: It’s involuntary, meaning it works
automatically. _(heart)_

- As students share, expand their responses using richer and more complex
language, including, if possible, any Read-Aloud vocabulary.


Check for Understanding


**Think-Share:** How do the skeletal and muscular systems work
together? _(Answers may vary, but may include that the muscular_
_system helps move the skeleton.)_


- Now, remind students that at the end of yesterday’s Read-Aloud, Dr. Welbody
gave them a clue about the system they will be learning about today. In the
previous Read-Aloud she said, “We’ll have a lot to chew on.” Ask them to
guess what she meant.


- Then, affirm that they are going to talk about food and how food travels
through their bodies. Explain that today they are going to learn about the
digestive system.


- Prior to the Read-Aloud, quickly review _liquids_ and _solids_ if students are
unfamiliar with those terms.


  - Liquids are wet substances that take the shape of the containers they are
in. Examples include water and milk.


  - Solids are foods that are not liquids, such as cheese, broccoli, and bread.

~~_burrito as you read the first sentence.]_~~


Yum! A chicken burrito! I, Dr. Welbody, the





rhyming pediatrician, am feeling hungry! I

think a chicken burrito would taste mighty

good right about now.



Healthy foods like chicken burritos, homemade pizza, apples, and carrots are

extremely important to our bodies. We cannot live without food. Food is the

fuel that gives us the energy we need to stay alive, to walk, talk, think, and

breathe. The energy from food helps us stay warm. We use its energy even

when we are sleeping. Food also provides the material to build our bodies.

Food helps children grow. It helps us heal when we are hurt or sick. So, how

do our bodies process, or digest, the food we eat? Your **digestive system**

makes all this happen. Let’s find out how it works. ~~_The digestive system is the_~~

~~_group of organs that work together to help your body turn the food you eat_~~

~~_into energy._~~

Check for Understanding


**Fill in the Blank:** A is a group of organs that work together
to help the body. _(system)_


**Show Image 4A-2: Child eating a cracker**

Pretend that you just took a bite out of a

cracker. What are you going to do now? That’s

right, chew! And while your teeth are crushing

and chomping on the cracker, a liquid called

saliva is helping to soften the food in your







mouth and make it even mushier. Does anyone

know another name for saliva? ~~_[Pause for_~~

~~_suggestions.]_~~ It’s spit!


**Show Image 4A-3: Esophagus and stomach**

Once your food is good and mushy, it is time

to swallow. When you do, the chewed-up

food goes into a tube that connects your

mouth to your **stomach** . This tube is called

your **esophagus** . ~~_[Point out the esophagus_~~

~~_in the illustration.]_~~ It is about half as long as

your arm and about as wide as your thumb.



Challenge


Ask students to explain
why they think muscles
are needed to squeeze
food down to the stomach.


**50**



The food doesn’t just slide down it. There are muscles in your esophagus

that squeeze the food along, the way you squeeze toothpaste from a tube.

From there, the food goes into your stomach. ~~_How do your muscles help the_~~

~~_digestive system?_~~


Unit 2 The Human Body


**Show Image 4A-4: Stomach**

Do you know where your stomach is? If you

point to a spot a little above your belly button

and then move your hand a little more to the

left, you can feel your rib bones. ~~_[Pause while_~~

~~_students find their stomachs.]_~~ Your stomach

is there, partly behind your ribs. Your stomach

is like a big bag or balloon. It expands, or gets



bigger, as it fills with food. Powerful muscles in your stomach squeeze the

food and churn it around like clothes in a washing machine. ~~_Again, how does_~~

~~_your muscular system help your digestive system?_~~ At the same time, stomach

juices—a watery mixture made by your body—help turn the mushy food into

liquid. Food stays in your stomach for about three or four hours. **Digestion** is

happening while you work, play, and sleep. ~~_Digestion is the process your body_~~

~~_uses to turn your food into the things your body needs. Think about what you_~~

~~_ate last. Your body might be digesting it right now._~~


Every time you eat a meal, you swallow a little air. As your stomach churns

the food, the air makes noises, sometimes called “tummy rumblings.” When

the air passes back out through your mouth, sometimes with a loud noise, it

is called belching or burping. ~~_Is it polite to say “excuse me” when you burp?_~~

~~_Well, now you know that burping happens during digestion._~~


**Show Image 4A-5: Small intestine**

The liquid moves from your stomach a little





bit at a time into a tube called the small

**intestine** . ~~_[Point to the illustration.]_~~ Your small

intestine is narrow, but it is very long—around

fifteen feet in all. Since you are probably only

around four feet tall, how does your intestine,

more than three times longer than you are tall,



fit inside you? ~~_Here’s a hint: Think of a jump rope or water hose that is not_~~

~~_stretched out, but that is folded up._~~ The answer is that your intestine is all

coiled (or folded) up inside you, underneath your stomach. Food stays in the

small intestine about six hours.


In the small intestine, all the good things from the liquid food get absorbed

by, or taken into, your blood. The blood carries these nutrients and vitamins

from the liquid food that’s been digested around your body so they can give

you energy, help you grow, and keep you healthy.

**Show Image 4A-6: Small intestine to large**

**intestine**

But there are still some bits of food that

aren’t used up and are left behind in the

small intestine. These leftover bits are called

waste. The waste gets pushed into your

large intestine. This is a tube like your small

intestine, only shorter and wider. It is curled

refer to the lowest part of

like an upside-down “U” around your small intestine. ~~_[Pause and point to the_~~

bottom when you go to the bathroom. It may take two days for food to travel

through your whole digestive system.


**Show Image 4A-7: Dr. Welbody’s digestive**

And that is how digestion works. Here’s my

little rhyme about the digestive system:


_A healthy body needs good food_

_There really is no question._

_Your body gets the things it needs—_

_Just leave it to digestion!_



The next time we get together, I’ll help you find out all about the most

important muscle in your body, one that works all the time but never gets

tired! ~~_Do you know which muscle Dr. Welbody is talking about?_~~ ~~_(the heart)_~~

1. **Literal.** How long does it take the body to process, or digest, food? _(about_
_two days)_ Were your predictions correct? _(Answers may vary.)_


2. **Inferential.** Why do you need food? _(It provides the energy and material you_
_need to stay alive and to grow.)_

   - **Literal.** How does food get carried to other parts of your body to provide
the energy you need? _(through the blood)_


3. **Evaluative.** How do muscles help with digestion? _(Answers may vary, but_
_may include that they help squeeze the food on its way down the esophagus;_
_they squeeze the food and churn it around in the stomach, they help turn food_
_from solids into liquids in the stomach.)_

   - **Inferential** Are the stomach muscles voluntary or involuntary?
_(involuntary)_

1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Digestion is happening while you work and
play and sleep.”


2. Say the word _digestion_ with me.


3. Digestion is the process of breaking down food into a form that your body
can use.


4. Eating slowly and drinking lots of water helps to make digestion easier.


5. Tell about one of the organs or fluids in your body that helps with the
digestion of your food. Try to use the word _digestion_ when you tell about it.

[Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’
responses: “The saliva in my mouth helps digestion by . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use an Antonyms activity for follow-up.** Directions: Digestion is a natural
process that we hardly notice in our bodies. Sometimes the process gets
interrupted. When this happens we sometimes burp and belch. These are
signs of indigestion, and it can feel very unpleasant to our bodies. I will read
four sentences to you. If the sentence tells about a normal part of digestion,
say, “That’s digestion.” If it is not a normal part of digestion say, “That’s
indigestion.”


   - I chewed my apple into tiny bits before swallowing it. _(That’s digestion.)_


   - I had stomach pains after lunch yesterday. _(That’s indigestion.)_


   - I began to burp at the dinner table. _(That’s indigestion.)_

**Show Image 5A-3: Circulatory system**

~~_What do you see in this picture? What is a_~~

~~_system?_~~ ~~_(a group of organs that work together)_~~


The blood is not just sloshing around inside

of you. It moves around through tubes called

**blood vessels** . Some are big and some are

small. A map of the blood vessels in a human

body looks like a bunch of tangled spaghetti.



But your blood vessels are actually laid out very carefully, like a well-planned

system of highways and roads. They carry blood to every single part of you,

from the top of your head to the tips of your fingers and toes. They are part of

a system called the circulatory system that includes your **heart** and blood. ~~_You_~~

~~_just heard the word_~~ ~~circulatory~~ ~~_. What word do you hear in_~~ ~~circulatory~~ ~~_? (_~~ ~~circle~~ ~~_)_~~ ~~_A_~~

~~_circulatory system is a system that moves things around in a circle._~~


The blood is able to move through your blood vessels because of your heart.

Your heart is a muscle about the size of your fist. Put your right hand on the

middle of your chest. Now move it a little to the left. ~~_[Model this action and_~~

~~_pause until all students are engaged.]_~~ Your heart is underneath there, inside

your chest, protected by your rib bones. Your heart is a hard worker! Its job

is to pump your blood around your body through your blood vessels. This

movement of your blood around your body is called circulation.

Now stop running. Place your hand on your chest. Can you feel your heart

Now, everyone make a fist. ~~_[Model for students and pause until all students_~~

~~_are engaged.]_~~ In order to do this, you made the muscles of your hand tighten.

That is what happens over and over to your heart, without you ever having to

think about it. When the heart muscle contracts, or tightens, blood goes out

of the chambers. When the heart muscle relaxes, blood flows in.


**Show Image 5A-5: Blood vessels around**
**major organs**

Your body needs two things to stay alive:

oxygen and nutrients. Oxygen is taken out

of the air inside your lungs. Nutrients come

from the food you eat as it moves through





your intestines. Your blood carries the oxygen

and nutrients to all parts of your body so that



you can stay alive, move, think, and grow. Your blood also cleanses your

body, taking away waste, or things your body does not need. It takes about

a minute for your blood to travel from your heart, all around your body, and

back to your heart!


**Show Image 5A-6: Types of blood vessels**

Veins, arteries and capillaries are the types

of blood vessels found throughout your body.

~~_The blue lines represent veins; the red lines_~~

~~_are arteries. The very fine, or thin, lines are_~~

~~_capillaries._~~ Veins bring blood to the heart.







Arteries carry blood away from it. Capillaries

are tiny blood vessels that connect your

arteries to your veins. They carry blood to even

the smallest parts of the body.


**Show Image 5A-7: Doctor listening to**
**child’s heart**


~~_Do you know what the doctor has in her ears?_~~

~~_(stethoscope)_~~

It is very important to have a strong, healthy

heart. If you came to me for a checkup, I would

use my stethoscope to listen to your heartbeat.

A healthy heart makes a sound with each beat

that sounds like this: lub-dub. The sound comes

from the heart as it pumps the blood.


Unit 2 The Human Body


Even without a stethoscope, your can feel your heart working. You can feel

your **pulse** in places where there is an artery close to the skin. Try putting

two fingers on the palm side of your wrist, just below your thumb. Press

lightly. ~~_[Demonstrate, and give students a few minutes to try it.]_~~ Can you feel

a small beat under your skin? Each beat is caused by the squeezing of your

heart. Lub-dub, lub-dub.


**Show Image 5A-8: Child exercising**

Remember that your heart is the most

important muscle in your body. How do we

make a muscle strong? By exercising it! That

means moving hard and fast. When you dance,

play basketball, swim, or jump rope, you are





exercising not just your arms and legs, but

your heart as well. Another way to take care



of your heart is to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables that are good for you

instead of soft drinks, chips, and candy. By exercising and eating healthy

foods, you will be helping your heart stay healthy and strong for many years

to come.


**Show Image 5A-9: Dr. Welbody’s circulatory**

**system**

Now, here’s a rhyming cheer for the part of our

circulatory system that keeps it all going:





_My heart is always working_
_It’s busy night and day_
_It’s pumping while I’m sleeping_
_And while I work and play—_
_Let’s give a cheer for hearts now,_
_For hearts: HIP, HIP, HOORAY!_



Next time, we’ll learn about the control center of our bodies. That’s the brain.

Your brain tells your muscles what to do and

how to move. Messages travel back and forth

from your brain to other parts of your body

by moving up and down your spinal cord with

lightning speed. ~~_[Point to the spinal cord in the_~~

Let’s pretend that you are playing soccer. One

of your teammates takes control of the ball

from the other team and kicks the ball toward

you. When you see the ball flying in your

direction, your brain sends a message down

your spinal cord to your nerves. Your nerves

send a message to your muscles in less than a



second to help you move and kick the ball. Goal! ~~_What kind of muscles would_~~

~~_you be using here—voluntary or involuntary? (voluntary)_~~

Your brain is made of as many as 86 billion cells.

~~_A billion is a really, really big number! That means_~~

~~_that your brain has many, many cells._~~ The cells

in your brain send millions of messages every

single second to each other and to the rest of





your body. The cells send messages back and

forth through branches that connect one cell to



another. Different parts of your body receive the messages. Your brain sends

messages even while you are asleep to help you breathe and dream.


**Show Image 6A-8: Sense receptors**

Your brain gets messages about the world

from your five senses, through organs called

sense receptors. Here are the sense receptors

and what they control: ~~_[Point to each one in the_~~

~~_green part in the diagram]_~~, is the biggest part

of your brain. It controls things like seeing,

hearing, thinking, speaking, remembering,

to balance on one foot without holding on to anything. ~~_[Pause, allowing_~~

~~_students time to stand as you model for them.]_~~ Can you do this for a long

time? Your cerebellum is helping you. It helps you move different muscles

together in coordination, to do things like catch a baseball, dance, or write.

Your brain stem ~~_[Point to the blue part in the diagram]_~~ connects your brain

to your spinal cord. It controls things your body does without you having to

think about them, like breathing and the beating of your heart.


**Show Image 6A-10: Dr. Welbody’s nervous**

Now, aren’t you glad to have that very

important organ called a brain? Here’s a

rhyme about it that we can all learn:







_Without a brain_
_Where would I be?_
_I could not move or think or see,_
_Or write my name or count to three,_


_In fact I just would not be me_
_Without my trusty brain!_
_In sun or wind or rain,_
_I’m glad I have a brain!_



The next time we meet, we’re going to talk about some icky things. They are

everywhere around us, and they can make us really sick. They’re called harmful

germs. But we will also learn about some very smart and famous germ-fighters

have finished drawing, instruct students to dictate or write a sentence using
the word(s) _nerves_ and/or _brain_ (e.g., “Nerves carry messages to my brain.”).


  - Have students share their writing and drawings with each other.


  - After students have shared with one another, tell the class they will use their
writing to create the next sentence in the informational paragraph on the
body systems.


  - Review what the class has written so far, and ask students to share with
the class a sentence they made or think would be helpful to add to this
paragraph. Synthesize student responses into a sentence for the class
paragraph (e.g., “My brain, spinal cord, and nerves make up my nervous
system and carry messages around my body.”).

##### Pausing Point


~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


This is the end of the Read-Alouds about the five systems of the human
body. You should pause here to review, reinforce, and/or extend the
material taught thus far.


It is highly recommended you use the Mid-Unit Assessment to assess
students’ knowledge of the human body. You may also have students do any
combination of the following activities in any order, or create other activities
that will help review, reinforce, and/or extend the material taught so far.


~~**CORE CONTENT OBJECTIVES UP TO THIS PAUSING POINT**~~


Students will:


  - Explain that the human body is a network of systems


  - Identify the skeletal, muscular, digestive, circulatory, and nervous systems


  - Recall basic facts about the skeletal, muscular, digestive, circulatory, and
nervous systems


  - Explain that the heart is a muscle integral to the circulatory system


  - Identify the brain as the body’s control center


~~**MID-UNIT ASSESSMENT**~~


**Body Systems**

  - Use Activity Page PP.1 to evaluate students’ knowledge of four of the five
body systems presented in the first six Read-Alouds. Ask students to identify
the missing body system ( _skeletal_ ) and its main component ( _bones_ ).


~~**ACTIVITIES**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.7.D**~~


**Image Review**

  - You may show the Flip Book images from any Read-Aloud again and have
students retell the Read-Aloud using the images.


**TEKS 1.7.D** Retell texts in ways that maintain meaning.

**Image Card Review**


Materials: Image Cards 6–10

 - Hold Image Cards 6–10 in your hand, fanned out like a deck of cards. Ask a
student to choose a card but to not show it to anyone else in the class. The
student must then perform an action or say a clue about the picture they
are holding. For example, for the digestive system, a student may pretend to
be eating or drinking. The rest of the class will guess which body system is
being described. Proceed to another card when the correct answer has been
given.


**Unit-Related Trade Book or Student Choice**

 - Read a trade book to review a particular unit concept. You may also choose
to have the students select a Read-Aloud to be heard again.


**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**

 - Give students a key vocabulary word such as _circulatory system_ . Have them
brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear the word, such as
“The heart pumps blood around and around the inside of our bodies,” etc.
Record their responses on the board/chart paper for reference.


**Riddles for Core Content**

 - To review the core content, ask students riddles such as the following:


   - I push food through my long tube from the mouth to the stomach. What
am I? ( _esophagus_ )


   - I am the body’s special framework, supporting it so that it doesn’t fall over
into a heap. What am I? ( _skeleton_ )


   - I send messages to and from the brain. What am I? ( _nerves_ )


   - I help the body move. What am I? ( _muscles_ )


**Guest Presenter**

 - Invite the school nurse to come to the class and read a book or give a
presentation on a topic related to the first six Read-Alouds in this unit.
Parents who work in the health care profession (doctors, nurses, nurses’
aides) would also be good sources.

**Show Image 7A-1: Dr. Welbody’s heroes**

Did you know that doctors have heroes? I’m

going to tell you about two of my heroes, both

brave germ-fighters. Their names are Edward

Jenner and Louis Pasteur. Jenner was a doctor.

Pasteur was a scientist. Both lived long ago. Their







work made the world a safer place for all of us.


**Show Image 7A-2: Germs**
~~_What do you see in this picture?_~~

**Germs** are all around us. These tiny living

things are so small that you can see them

only by looking through a special type of

instrument called a microscope. But even

though you cannot see them, germs are

everywhere—in the air we breathe, in the



Support


Ask students to recall
what system in the body
includes the intestines.
(the digestive system)


**88**



water we drink, in the food we eat, and on our skin. Most of the time germs

do not hurt us. Some germs even help us, like the ones in our intestines that

kill off harmful germs and help us digest our food.


**TEKS 1.6.E** Make connections to personal experiences, ideas in other texts, and society with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.6.G**
Evaluate details to determine what is most important with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and texts the

Unit 2 The Human Body


But other germs can make us sick. They get into our bodies in different

ways. Some creep in through insect bites or cuts in our skin. Others float in

when someone sneezes nearby. Still others come from food that is poorly

cleaned or undercooked. ~~_Have you ever heard of immunity?_~~ We have natural

**immunities** in our bodies. That means our bodies have ways of fighting off

germs on their own. But sometimes, this is not enough.


**Show Image 7A-3: Child’s doctor visit**

That is why doctors and scientists are always

working to find new ways to fight sicknesses,

also called **diseases** . Doctors treat people

who are sick or injured. They also meet with

patients on a regular basis to help them live

healthily to prevent diseases. One other

important way they fight diseases is by giving

people medicines called **vaccines** .


Vaccines can also give you immunity. That means they keep bad germs from

harming you in the first place, before you get sick. Doctors give vaccines

by vaccinating people. Vaccinations help give us immunity to, or protect us

from harmful diseases. Each person may choose whether to get a vaccine.

Some people may choose not to get vaccines for personal reasons. ~~_What do_~~

~~_doctors give people to protect them from harmful diseases?_~~ ~~_(vaccinations)_~~

There are other ways that people acquire immunity from diseases. For

example, getting an illness such as chicken pox helps prevent someone from

against getting it again in the future. This is a form of natural immunity.

Doctors also use something called antibody treatments for people that

cannot receive some vaccines.


**Show Image 7A-4: Smallpox hospital**

~~_This is the way a hospital looked long ago._~~

Long ago, people did not know about germs.

They did not understand what made people

sick. They did not know how important it is

to wash your hands, to eat clean and healthy





food, and to drink clean water. They did not

know how to protect themselves from getting



bad germs in their bodies. Sometimes thousands of people at a time would

die from a disease as germs spread quickly from one person to another.


Lesson 7 Dr. Welbody’s Heroes
**89**


**Show Image 7A-5: Portrait of Edward Jenner**

About two hundred years ago, an English

doctor discovered something amazing. He

discovered a way to keep people from getting

one of the most terrible diseases in the world,

a disease called smallpox. Edward Jenner, one

of my heroes, invented the first vaccine.


**Show Image 7A-6: Dairy farm**

Dr. Jenner was living in a country village in

England. There were many farms all around

~~_like the one shown in the picture_~~ . He knew

what the farmers in his village knew: people

who milked cows sometimes got a disease

called cowpox. The disease made blisters on

their hands, but it was not a serious disease.



Challenge


Ask students how they
think Dr. Jenner made
this observation about
smallpox.



People got over it quickly. Dr. Jenner also noticed that people who got

cowpox almost never came down with another disease that was smallpox, a

much worse disease. He thought that cowpox might give people protection

from getting smallpox.


**Show Image 7A-7: Early innovation**

After a lot of thinking and studying, Dr. Jenner

decided to test his idea. He decided to give

a healthy boy a small amount of the cowpox

germs. The boy got sick with cowpox, just as

Dr. Jenner thought he would. Then after the





boy got better, Jenner gave the boy a small

amount of the smallpox germs. Just as Jenner



**90**



hoped, the boy did not get smallpox. ~~_While Dr. Jenner’s work is a historic_~~

~~_achievement, vaccination today looks much different, with vaccines being_~~

~~_developed and tested in laboratories._~~


Unit 2 The Human Body


**Show Image 7A-8: Portrait of Edward Jenner**

But Dr. Jenner did not understand exactly how

the vaccination had worked. It was up to other

doctors and scientists to find out. Another

germ fighter, and another one of my heroes, is

Louis Pasteur.


**Show Image 7A-9: Louis Pasteur**

Louis Pasteur was born in France a year after

Dr. Jenner died. As a boy, he worked very

hard in school and was very curious, always

asking a lot of questions. When he grew up,

he became a science professor, teaching at a

university. He was also a medical researcher,

someone who tries to find out what causes

diseases and how they can be cured.



Using a microscope, Pasteur saw that liquids, like milk and fruit juice,

contain tiny living things called germs. Some of these germs caused the milk

or juice to spoil, or go bad. Pasteur discovered that he could kill the harmful

germs by heating the liquid to a high temperature. Heating liquids this way

to get rid of germs became known as **pasteurization** . ~~_Why was the name_~~

~~pasteurization~~ ~~_given to this process?_~~


**Show Image 7A-10: Milk**

Today, because of Pasteur’s discovery, the

milk we drink—as well as some other foods—

are pasteurized to make them safe before we

buy them. Just as important, Pasteur’s work

on pasteurization convinced other doctors





and scientists that germs are real and may

cause disease. People began to realize how

important it is to keep harmful germs out of

our food and water.



Lesson 7 Dr. Welbody’s Heroes
**91**


**Show Image 7A-11: Additional work by**
**Dr. Pasteur**

~~_Dr. Pasteur helped people in other ways. Listen_~~

~~_to find out how he helped a young boy who_~~

~~_became sick with another disease._~~


But Pasteur did not stop there. He continued

Jenner’s work with vaccines, working to

discover how to prevent many more diseases.



One of the vaccines he developed fought a very dangerous disease called

rabies. Pasteur had been working on a vaccine for rabies for quite a

while when a nine-year-old boy was badly bitten by a dog that carried the

disease. Dr. Pasteur thought that his new vaccine would help the boy. He

gave the boy the vaccine, because there was a chance it would cure him.

Dr. Pasteur’s vaccine worked, and he was hailed as a hero! Today, rabies

vaccines are given to pets routinely to prevent this disease. They are also

given to humans after exposure to help fight infection if a human is bitten

by an animal with rabies. Pasteur led the way for other scientists to make

vaccines for many other diseases.


**Show Image 7A-12: Science researchers**

Today, once you are vaccinated against or

have experienced a disease, it decreases your

chances of catching that disease. There are

still diseases for which scientists have not yet





found the right vaccine. But they are working

hard at it. New vaccines will be discovered by

other germ-fighters. If you study medicine or



science and become a researcher, that germ-fighter could even be you!


**Show Image 7A-13: Dr. Welbody’s heroes**


_So if you are a scientist,_
_You’ll discover something new,_
_And you could be a germ fighter_
_Who is a hero, too!_

2. Say the word _diseases_ with me.


3. Diseases are sicknesses or illnesses, things that harm our bodies from the
inside, not as the result of accidents or physical injuries.


4. One of the most common diseases, often present in winter months, is
influenza, or the flu.


5. Tell about some diseases with which you are familiar. Try to use the words
_disease_ or _diseases_ as you talk about them. [Ask two or three students. If
necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses: “My neighbor
has heart disease.”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** The hospital is a place where
doctors treat diseases, but the hospital is also a place that people without
diseases sometimes go. I am going to describe why some people are in the
hospital. If the person is there because of an illness, say, “That is a disease.”
If not, say, “That is not a disease.”


   - Jamar’s grandfather is going through treatment for his cancer. _(That is a_
_disease.)_


   - Min’s mother gave birth to a baby girl. _(That is not a disease.)_


   - Terrence just turned seven years old and is having his regular wellness

~~**“FIVE KEYS TO HEALTH” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 8A-1: Dr. Welbody**

Hi everybody—and I do mean body. It’s

your old friend, Doctor Welbody. We’ve been

learning a lot about the human body. Now

I’m back to talk about how you can take good

care of yours. Remember that there is only





one you. That makes you special. You can take

good care of your body by giving it certain



things it needs to keep it **healthy** . ~~Healthy~~ ~~_means strong and well._~~ So,


_Here are five things to do_
_To take good care of special you:_


**Show Image 8A-2: Collage of healthy foods**

1.) EAT WELL. Your body needs lots of energy to

keep it going. You need energy to work and play.

You need energy to grow. Energy comes from food.

Food is the fuel your body runs on, just like a car

runs on gas. But some foods are much better for





you than others. The best foods to keep you going

and growing are **nutritious** foods. They have lots of



nutrients, such as protein and vitamins that help keep you well. Nutritious foods include

fruits, dried beans, lentils, vegetables, whole grain bread, brown rice, nuts, fish, and

chicken.
**TEKS 1.6.E** Make connections to personal experiences, ideas in other texts, and society with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.6.G**
Evaluate details to determine what is most important with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and texts the
student is able to read or hear to learn or clarify word meanings.


Lesson 8 Five Keys to Health
**101**


**Show Image 8A-3: Junk food**

~~_Look at this picture and tell me how these foods_~~

~~_are different from the ones you saw in the last_~~

~~_picture._~~ ~~_(Answers may vary, but should indicate_~~

~~_these foods are not nutritious or good for you.)_~~


What about sweet, sugary foods like candy or

cookies? They may taste good and give you

some quick energy, but it wears off fast, leaving you feeling weak and hungry

again. These foods are only good to eat once in a long while as a special

treat. Eating these foods regularly can make you gain weight and give you

cavities, or small holes, in your teeth. Fatty foods like bacon, French fries,

and chips are not very nutritious either. They can make you gain weight and

slow you down. By eating nutritious foods, you’ll be able to think better,

jump higher, run faster, and grow stronger.


**Show Image 8A-4: Water for plants**

**and animals**

Part of eating well means knowing what

to drink. Do you have some plants at home

or in your classroom that need to be

watered? Every plant and animal needs

water. You do, too!


**Show Image 8A-5: Child drinking water**

Much of your body is made up of water. You

have water in your muscles and around your

brain. Because water is so important to your

body, be sure to drink plenty of water every

day.


**Show Image 8A-6: Children exercising**

2.) EXERCISE. Your body is made for moving—

for running and jumping, pushing and pulling,

dancing and diving, throwing and catching,

leaping and skipping. Participating in an

activity in which you are moving your body


Unit 2 The Human Body


to keep it healthy and fit is called **exercising** . Exercising helps your bones

stay strong. It makes your muscles bigger. It makes your lungs and heart

stronger. It helps you fight germs, and it can help to put you in a good

mood. You can exercise by hitting a baseball, kicking a soccer ball, jumping

rope, dancing, climbing a tree, rowing a boat, skating, or doing many other

activities. Just choose something that’s fun for you and get moving every

day!


**Show Image 8A-7: Child sleeping**

3.) SLEEP. After you have spent a day at work

and play, you feel tired. That is a sign that

you need to recharge your body. How can you

do this? By going to sleep! Sleep rests your

body and helps clear your mind for the next





day. If you don’t get enough sleep, you may

feel grouchy, and your brain won’t work as



well. Children need between ten and twelve hours of sleep every night. That

means that if you have to get up at seven o’clock in the morning to get ready

for school, you should be in bed sometime between seven and nine o’clock

at night. A well-rested body will stay healthier, too.


**Show Image 8A-8: Child in a bubble bath**

4.) KEEP CLEAN. Washing with soap and

water will get rid of germs that could make

you sick. So jump into that bubble bath or

shower, and scrub. Don’t forget to wash your

hair with shampoo, too. You will look, smell,







and feel good!


**Show Image 8A-9: Child washing hands**

Wash your hands often during the day—

before you eat, after you go to the bathroom,

and whenever they look dirty. When your

fingernails look dirty, you should scrub

underneath them with a brush. Washing your

hands often is a great way to wash germs

down the drain.

The word _brush_ also
refers to the thing you
use to brush your teeth (a
toothbrush) or to paint a
picture (a paintbrush).


Challenge


Ask students to explain
why it is important to visit
a pediatrician even when
they are not sick.


**104**







**Show Image 8A-10: Child brushing teeth**

And don’t forget to brush, brush, brush your

teeth at least twice a day. ~~Brush~~ ~~_here means to_~~

~~_clean your teeth._~~ This washes away the germs

that cause cavities. Use dental floss in between

your teeth. Then you will have a bright, clean

smile that says, “I take good care of my body!”


**Show Image 8A-11: Child at the doctor**

5.) HAVE CHECKUPS. Germs are all around

us. They are on plants and animals, in food

and in water. Most of the time germs don’t

harm us, but what if you wake up one morning

with a headache, a fever, and a sore throat?

Uh-oh! Some germs have made you sick!

Since your body has natural ways to fight



most germs, you will probably feel better in a few days. ~~_What are the body’s_~~

~~_natural ways of fighting germs called? (immunities)_~~ If not, you should go to

see a doctor like me who can give you medicine to help you get well.


Even when you’re feeling terrific, it is important to have regular checkups

with a pediatrician at least once a year. Your doctor will make sure you

are healthy and growing. Your doctor will also help keep you from getting

diseases by giving you vaccinations or other medicines. I always look

forward to seeing how much my patients have grown when they come in for

their wellness checkups after each birthday.


**Show Image 8A-12: Dr. Welbody**

There you have it: Dr. Welbody’s five fun and

easy ways to take care of your body. I hope

you’ll try them all. And now, before I go, let’s

give a healthy body cheer!





_YES, YES, YES to veggies,_
_To fruit and chicken, too!_
_NO to too much candy—_
_‘Cause it’s not good for you!_

~~**“THE PYRAMID PANTRY” (15 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.3.D**~~


**Show Image 9A-1: Chef Steph**

Hi, I’m Chef Steph, a friend of Dr. Welbody’s.

Welcome to my restaurant, the **Pyramid** Pantry!


Dr. Welbody eats lunch here every day. It is a

very cool restaurant, if I do say so myself.



Support


Explain that a pantry is a
place to store food, and is
usually a part of, or next
to, a kitchen.





Do you know what a pyramid is? It is a shape

with triangular sides. My restaurant is shaped like a pyramid. The menu is

like a pyramid, too. The food we serve is delicious. But that’s not all—it’s

nutritious! That means it’s good for you!


Have you ever heard of vitamins and minerals? They are **nutrients** that your

body needs to stay alive. ~~_Nutrients are the parts of food that provide the_~~

~~_things your body needs._~~ Nutritious foods supply your body with the nutrients

you need. They give you the energy you need to play and learn all day.

They keep you healthy and help you grow. But not all foods have the same
amounts of nutrients. So which foods are the best for you?


**TEKS 1.3.D** Identify and use words that name actions, directions, positions, sequences, categories, and locations;
**TEKS 1.6.F** Make inferences and use evidence to support understanding with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.7.C** Use text evidence
to support an appropriate response; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and texts the student is able to read or hear to learn or
clarify word meanings.


Lesson 9 The Pyramid Pantry
**113**


Check for Understanding


**Recall:** How are nutrients carried through the body? _(through the_
_blood)_


**Show Image 9A-2: Food pyramid**

My pyramid menu is one way to help you figure

all this out. The foods are divided into groups.

Each group has a different-colored stripe on the

pyramid: ~~_[Point to each stripe as you describe it._~~

~~_Explain to students that there are other shapes_~~





~~_and pictures that can help them remember which_~~

~~_food groups are healthiest and that they will be_~~

~~_learning about another picture later in the day.]_~~




 - orange: for grains, like bread and cereal


 - green: for vegetables, like carrots and green beans


 - red: for fruits, like apples and oranges


 - blue: for milk and milk products


 - purple: for meat and beans


Some stripes are wider than others. You should choose most of your foods

from the groups with wider stripes because you need more of these foods

to stay healthy. Each stripe gets narrower as it goes up the pyramid. That’s

because every food group has some foods that are better for you than

others.


**Show Image 9A-3: Oils**

There is one skinny yellow stripe on the

pyramid, too. Do you see it? It stands for oils

and for fats like butter and mayonnaise. Why

do you think this stripe is so skinny? ~~_[Pause_~~

~~_for student responses.]_~~ You need to eat a little





oil or fat every day, but not very much. Oils

help you grow, keep you warm, protect your



**114**



bones, help your brain think, and keep your skin and hair healthy. Some oils


Unit 2 The Human Body


are better for you than others. For example, olive oil and canola oil are better

choices than margarine and mayonnaise.


What do I hear? Is all this talk of food making your tummy growl? That’s what

happens when you are hungry. If you were very hungry, your legs might feel

a little weak. You might even feel a bit cranky. These are signs that your body

needs food. Time to look more closely at the pyramid menu!


**Show Image 9A-4: Grains**

Grains are special types of grasses. Wheat,

rice, oats, barley, and rye are all grains. Foods

that belong to this group are either whole

grains or refined grains. For example, bread

is in the grain group. Some breads, like whole





wheat bread, are made from whole grains.

Other breads, like white bread, are made from



refined grains. Refined grains have had most of their healthy parts taken out,

whereas whole grains still have all the nutrients your body needs to grow. ~~_So,_~~

~~_which do you think is better for you: whole wheat bread made from nutrient-_~~

~~_filled whole grains, or white bread?_~~ Whole wheat bread, brown rice, whole

wheat spaghetti, whole wheat crackers, oatmeal, rice cakes, and popcorn

(yum!) are all good choices. Always choose smaller amounts of refined
grain foods like white bread, white bagels, and corn flakes. And remember to

choose only a little bit of sugary, refined-grain foods like cupcakes, donuts,

and sweetened cereals. Too much sugar is not good for your body!


**Show Image 9A-5: Vegetables**

Look at the picture and tell me what foods

you think belong to the next group on the

food pyramid. ~~_[Pause for student responses.]_~~

That’s right—it’s vegetables! Vegetables come

in a rainbow of colors—red, orange, yellow,





green, blue, purple, and white. Did you know

that the color of a vegetable tells what it can



do for your body? For example, dark green veggies like broccoli and spinach

help build strong teeth and bones. Orange vegetables like carrots help you

see well. Fried vegetables like onion rings and French fries are less healthy

for your body because they are cooked in oil and fat. So, just remember to

choose a rainbow of vegetables, raw or cooked (but hardly ever fried), and

your body will get the nutrients it needs.


Lesson 9 The Pyramid Pantry
**115**


**Show Image 9A-6: Fruit**

Raise your hand if you like to eat fruit. Fruits

are delicious and come in beautiful colors.

Does anyone see one of your favorite fruits in

the picture? ~~_[Pause for responses and point_~~

~~_to the fruits named.]_~~ Just like vegetables, it

is important to choose a rainbow of fruits to

get all the nutrients your body needs. The



best fruits to choose are fresh fruits like the ones you see in the picture—

pineapples, oranges, bananas, grapes, pears and blueberries. Dried fruits and

canned fruits, jams and jellies, and fruit pies are all good too; just don’t eat

too many of them. Can anyone guess why? ~~_[Pause for student responses.]_~~

That’s right—because they often contain sugar.


**Show Image 9A-7: Milk**

Look at this picture and tell me what you see.

~~_[Pause for student responses.]_~~ This is the milk

group. But, as you can see, it includes other

things as well—products made from milk, like

cheese and yogurt. These things provide your





body with calcium and protein—things it needs

to make strong teeth and bones and help you



grow. ~~_What system in your body do your bones belong to? (skeletal system)_~~

It’s best to choose low-fat milk and milk foods, like skim milk, low-fat cheese,

and low-fat yogurt. Eat fewer fatty or sweet foods like American cheese,

frozen yogurt, ice cream, and milk shakes.


**Show Image 9A-8: Meat and beans**

The last group is meat and beans. Beef,

pork, chicken, fish, and turkey all belong to

this group. But look at the picture. Do you

see anything that doesn’t seem to belong?

Yes, eggs and beans. So, why are they there?





They contain protein, just like meat. These

different foods all work in the same way to



**116**



help your body grow and move because they all contain protein. It’s best to

eat the meats grilled or roasted instead of fried in fatty cooking oil or butter.

That means you should choose smaller amounts of fried chicken, chicken

nuggets, hamburgers, and fish sticks.


Unit 2 The Human Body


**Show Image 9A-9: Food pyramid**

Now we have looked at foods in all six

categories, or groups, included in the food

pyramid. Can you name the six categories

with me? ~~_[Pause for student responses.]_~~ The

most important thing to remember is to eat a

balanced diet. That means you must choose a

variety of foods from each food group. Eating



Challenge


Have students describe
a meal they ate recently
that included at least
three of the five categories
on the food pyramid.



only grains or only meats will not provide your body with the nutrients it

needs. Your body needs foods from each group on the pyramid to help

it grow. ~~**[TEKS 1.3.D ]**~~


Are you ready to order some healthy meals from Chef Steph’s menu? Don’t

forget: it’s important to eat three—that’s one, two, three—healthy meals a

day, and to eat healthy snacks, too.


**Show Image 9A-10: Breakfast suggestion**

For breakfast, how about oatmeal with some

fresh strawberries? Adding a glass of orange

juice is a healthy choice as well.


**Show Image 9A-11: Lunch suggestion**

For lunch, may I recommend a sandwich

on whole wheat bread? How about some

carrot sticks with yogurt dip, followed by

an apple? A glass of cold milk is not only a

yummy addition, but it is healthy as well.





**Show Image 9A-12: Dinner suggestion**

And for dinner, how about trying some of my

three-bean vegetarian chili with a baked sweet

potato? For dessert, low-fat pudding with

peaches sounds perfect, doesn’t it?





**TEKS 1.3.D** Identify and use words that name actions, directions, positions, sequences, categories, and locations.


Lesson 9 The Pyramid Pantry
**117**


**Show Image 9A-13: Collage of healthy snacks**

Snacking between meals is fine as long as you

make healthy choices. Which would be better

for your body: ~~_[Pause for answers after each_~~

~~_question.]_~~ ice cream or a low-fat yogurt with

fruit? Potato chips or whole wheat crackers

and cheese? A candy bar or an orange?

Remember, healthy snacks will give you

longer-lasting energy and a healthier body.


**Show Image 9A-14: Food pyramid**

That brings me back to my pyramid. Did you

notice the stairs going up the side? Do you

know why they are there? ~~_[Pause for student_~~

~~_responses.]_~~ They are there to remind you to

keep moving. It’s very important to not just eat

healthy foods but to also be physically active

every day.


**Show Image 9A-15: Children exercising**

That means that you should participate in

skateboarding, swimming, riding your bike,

climbing in the playground, or any other sport

that you like to do. Keeping active helps you

stay the right weight for your body. It keeps

your bones and muscles in good shape. It

makes your heart and lungs stronger. If you



**118**



get into the good habit of having fun while you are moving, it will help you

stay healthy for the rest of your life!


Unit 2 The Human Body


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 9A-14: Food pyramid**


1. **Inferential.** What is the skinniest stripe on the food pyramid? _(yellow—fats_
_and oils)_ Why is it so skinny? _(because you should eat the least amount of_
_these foods)_


2. **Literal.** Why are there stairs on the pyramid? _(to remind us to exercise)_


3. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ Consider the types of food in each stripe
on the pyramid, and how much of each you should eat. Would a meal that
consisted of roasted chicken, green bean salad, and whole grain rice with a
dessert of low-fat frozen yogurt with strawberries be healthy enough? Explain
your answer. _(Answers may vary.)_


Check for Understanding


**Three’s Company:** Give each student a card with an image of
a particular food. Have them find other students with food that
belongs in the same category of the food pyramid. Have each
group share with the class what foods they have in their group.


~~**WORD WORK: NUTRIENTS (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “They are nutrients that your body needs to

stay alive.”


2. Say the word _nutrients_ with me.


3. _Nutrients_ are parts of food that provide the things your body needs.


4. Your blood carries nutrients through your body.


5. Can you name some foods that contain lots of nutrients? Try to use the word
_nutrients_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses: “ contain(s) lots of
nutrients.”]


6. What is the word we’ve been talking about?

**Writing:** Students will identify and label parts of an image to show the food groups
in a balanced diet.


~~**TEKS 1.6.E; TEKS 1.7.E**~~


**SAYINGS AND PHRASES: “AN APPLE A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR**
~~**AWAY” (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Write the saying “An apple a day keeps the doctor away” on the board/chart
paper. Read it to students and have students repeat the saying after you.


  - Ask students if they have ever heard anyone say “an apple a day keeps the
doctor away.”


  - Ask students what they think the saying means. _(Answers may vary.)_


  - Explain that this saying is another way of saying that if you eat healthy foods,
like apples, every day, you will not get sick very often. Then, you will mostly
only need to see a doctor like Dr. Welbody for “well visits.”


~~**MYPLATE MAGIC (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students what shape was used in today’s Read-Aloud to show how to eat
a balanced diet. _(pyramid)_


  - Explain that the pyramid is only one of many shapes that can be used to
show how much of each type of food someone should eat each day to stay
healthy.


  - Explain that it is also common to see a balanced diet shown in the form of a
dinner plate.


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 9.1.


  - Ask students how this plate looks different from the plate they may use for
dinner each night. _(Answers may vary, but may include the fact that there is_
_no food on the plate, and it is divided into four segments.)_

- Point out that the plate is divided into different segments, but that the
segments are not all the same size. Ask if students remember why the
pyramid in today’s Read-Aloud contained different-sized stripes.


- Explain that the stripes on the pyramid were different sizes based on how
much of that type of food you should eat each day, just as the segments on
this plate are different sizes. Both versions show how much of each type of
food you should eat each day.


Check for Understanding


**One-Word Answer:** Which type of food should you eat the most
of? _(vegetables)_


- Tell students they will be coloring in the segments of the plate as a class.
Have them take out their crayons to do this.


- Have students color the segment on the bottom-left portion of the plate,
labeled “vegetables,” green.


- Ask what they notice about the size of that segment compared to the other
parts of the plate. _(It is larger.)_ Ask why the vegetables segment is the
largest. _(You should eat more vegetables than anything else.)_


- Proceed, as a class, with coloring in the remaining three segments and the
circle labeled “dairy,” as follows: It is important to have students use those
colors for those segments, as this is consistent with the MyPlate symbol
created by the United States Department of Agriculture. As students color
in each segment, review information from today’s Read-Aloud about that
food group.


  - red: fruit


  - orange: grains


  - purple: protein


  - blue: dairy


Unit 2 The Human Body


  - When students complete their MyPlates, explain that if they follow the
directions on the plate for a balanced diet, they will be on their way to living a
healthy life!


  - After completing Activity Page 9.1, have students circle the segment on the
plate indicating which type of food they should eat the most of as part of a
balanced diet.


  - Collect Activity Page 9.1 to check that students are correctly identifying the
parts of the food plate and indicating that they should eat vegetables more
than other types of food as part of a balanced diet.

This is the last time that I, Dr. Welbody, the

rhyming pediatrician, will be meeting with you.

I’ve had a great time getting to know you, and I

hope you’ve learned a lot. Here is a poem that

talks about some of the things we’ve discovered:





**Show Image 10A-2: Child’s body systems**


_I have a special body, and it just belongs_
_to me._
_There are some parts on my outside and_
_others I can’t see._
_I know about my body, from my heels up_
_to my head,_
_‘Cause I’ve listened well to all that Dr._
_Welbody has said._


_The parts that make my body keep me healthy and alive._
_They are joined in groups called systems; I’ve learned about all five:_
_There are skeletal and muscular, which help me stand and move,_
_And the system called digestive that makes fuel out of food._

Unit 2 The Human Body


_My heart and vessels move my blood. (That’s known as circulation.)_
_My nerves work with my brain to get and process information._
_My systems form a network—it’s amazing as can be_


_That this_ **complicated** _network makes the person that is me._


**Show Image 10A-3: Dr. Welbody at her desk**

After all we’ve learned about our amazing

bodies, I’ll bet that now you will be able to

answer the questions I asked you in our very

first meeting. Let’s go through them and see

what you know!



Support


_Complicated_ means
difficult to understand.





Check for Understanding


**Thumbs-Up:** As you review the body systems, have students
signal with a thumbs-up when they have the answer.


**Show Image 10A-4: The skeletal system**

How many bones do you have? ~~_[Here and_~~

~~_after each of Dr. Welbody’s questions, pause to_~~

~~_check for understanding, then elicit answers_~~

~~_from students. Confirm and correct their_~~

~~_responses by rereading the text.]_~~ There are





over two hundred, joined together to form

your skeleton. Your skeleton keeps you



standing tall. Your bones are joined together by joints wherever you can

bend or move, like your knees, arms, and shoulders. Some of your bones

protect the softer parts of your body. Remember what protects your brain?

That’s right—your skull. And what bones protect your heart? Your ribs!


Lesson 10 What a Complicated Network!
**129**


**Show Image 10A-5: The muscular system**

Which muscle is the biggest in your body?

It’s your gluteus maximus or buttock muscle.

Did you know that you use muscles every

time you move? Often you decide when you

want to move your muscles. For example,

you have control over when you raise your

arm or lift your leg. But some muscles work



by themselves without your having to think about them. Does anyone

remember what we call the muscle that works like a pump all day and all

night to keep you alive? Yes! It’s your heart!


**Show Image 10A-6: The digestive system**

Why does your body still have food in it today





that you ate two days ago? Food moves slowly

through your body. It takes time for your body

to digest food, taking all the nutrients from

it that your body needs before getting rid of

the waste. Food goes from your mouth, down

your esophagus, and into your stomach before



reaching your intestines. The saliva in your mouth and the juices in your

stomach help break it down. Nutrients are absorbed into your bloodstream

from your small intestine. The waste passes into your large intestine, and

you get rid of it when you go to the bathroom.


**Show Image 10A-7: The circulatory system**

How long does it take for your blood to

circulate all around your body? It only takes

about one minute. Your heart muscle works

hard to pump your blood all around.





The blood moves through your blood vessels.

Does anyone remember what the blood

carries with it on its superhighway? The blood



**130**



carries oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body. It carries nutrients

from your food, too. Your heart works night and day to keep your blood

circulating.


Unit 2 The Human Body


**Show Image 10A-8: The nervous system**

What controls your five senses? Your brain!

You find out about the world through your

senses: by seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling,

and feeling. Nerves that connect to your spinal

cord carry this information to your brain. Your

brain is not only in charge of your senses; it

also controls your thinking, learning, speech,



and memory. It controls the movements you make and many other things

your body does. Your brain is the control center of the body.


**Show Image 10A-9: Dr. Welbody, pointing to**
**the food plate**

Remember that none of the systems of your

body can work properly unless you take care

of them. That means eating nutritious foods

and drinking plenty of water, exercising,







keeping clean, and getting plenty of sleep. Oh,

and don’t forget to visit a doctor like me for

checkups.


**Show Image 10A-10: Dr. Welbody, surrounded**
**by happy children**

Now before we say goodbye, here’s one final

rhyme for you to learn and take away with you.


_I’ve got a complicated body,_
_But I understand it well._
_Its systems form a network_
_To keep me feeling swell!_


_I’ll take good care of my body._
_I’ll exercise and rest._
_I promise to eat healthy foods_
_And to stay clean . . . I’ll do my best!_

**132**



~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 10A-2: Child’s body systems**


1. **Literal.** I’m going to name several body parts. Can you tell me to which
system each of these belongs?

   - skull _(skeletal system)_


   - brain _(nervous system)_


   - intestines _(digestive system)_


   - blood _(circulatory system)_


   - biceps _(muscular system)_


2. **Inferential.** Why is your heart so important? _(It pumps blood, which carries_
_nutrients your body needs, around your body.)_


3. **Literal.** Why is it important to exercise, stay clean, eat a balanced diet, get
enough rest, and have checkups? _(All those things help keep us free from_
_diseases or help us recover when we do get sick.)_


4. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ A network is a group of parts or systems that
work together. Why does Dr. Welbody describe the body as a complicated
network? _(Answers may vary, but should include that the body includes many_
_parts, or organs, that work together to form different systems. Those systems,_
_in turn, work together to form the network, or human body.)_


Unit 2 The Human Body


~~**WORD WORK: COMPLICATED (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “My systems form a network—it’s amazing as
can be, that this complicated network makes the person that is me.”


2. Say the word _complicated_ with me.


3. If something is complicated, it has many parts, making it hard to understand
or difficult to do.


4. I found the directions to your house very complicated because I had to make
so many turns.


5. Think of something that seems complicated to you. Try to use the word
_complicated_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses: “Learning to ride a bike was
complicated for me because . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I am going to read the names
of several activities. If the activity seems complicated, with lots of parts
and things to remember, say, “That’s complicated.” If not, say, “That’s not
complicated.” _(Answers may vary for all.)_


    - sailing a boat


    - jumping rope


    - eating breakfast


    - driving a car


    - listening to music


    - tying shoelaces

##### Application


**Speaking and Listening:** Students will discuss rhyme in a poem.


~~**TEKS 1.9.B**~~


Students will perform a poem about the human body.


~~**TEKS 1.1.C; TEKS 1.7.E**~~


**Writing:** Students will write a word or phrase about why it is important to
understand their complicated bodies.


~~**TEKS 1.7.E**~~


~~**POETRY ON STAGE (20 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.9.B**~~


  - Tell students they will perform a poem about the human body. Ask students
how rhyme can help them remember information.


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 10.1 and cut the cards apart along the
dotted lines.

**Part I**

  - Remind students that in the Read-Aloud, Dr. Welbody asked them to learn
one final rhyme to help them remember what they learned in this unit.


  - Tell students they are going to repeat this poem and add movements to it.


  - Read the poem aloud to them once or twice so they are familiar with the
words.


_I’ve got a complicated body,_
_But I understand it well._
_Its systems form a network_
_To keep me feeling swell!_


_I’ll take good care of my body._
_I’ll exercise and rest._
_I promise to eat healthy foods_
_And to stay clean . . . I’ll do my best!_


  - Once you feel that students have an initial grasp of the words, break the
poem down into sections, having them repeat the words with you.

**Part II**

  - Using the cards cut from Activity Page 10.1, assign each student one card


**TEKS 1.9.B** Discuss rhyme, rhythm, repetition, and alliteration in a variety of poems; **TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas
about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using the conventions of language; **TEKS 1.7.E**
Interact with sources in meaningful ways such as illustrating or writing.


Unit 2 The Human Body


and have them tape it to the front of their shirt.


 - Sort students into groups of five, making sure that every student in each
group has a different card. In other words, the newly formed groups will
represent each of the five body systems (skeletal, digestive, muscular,
circulatory, and nervous). These five body systems will work together in a
network as they act out the poem.


 - Proceed with instructions, coordinating words and movements:


[Stand with arms outspread like the pictures of Dr. Welbody’s various
systems.]


_I’ve got a complicated body,_
_But I understand it well._


[Join hands, walking in a circle, all five systems thus working together in a
network.]


_Its systems form a network_
_To keep me feeling swell!_


[Drop hands.]


_I’ll take good care of my body._
_I’ll exercise_ [Do a jumping jack.] _and rest._ [Put heads on folded hands.]
_I promise to eat healthy foods_ [Mime eating.]
_And to stay clean_ [Mime scrubbing the body.] _. . . I’ll do my best!_ [Put
hands out to side of shoulders.]


Check for Understanding


**Recall:** In the poem, Dr. Welbody mentions exercising, resting,
eating healthy foods, and staying clean. These are four of her five
keys to health. What is the fifth key? _(having checkups)_


Exit Pass


      - Give each student a piece of lined paper.


      - Ask students to write a word or phrase about why it is important
to understand their complicated bodies.

##### Unit Review


~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


You should spend one day reviewing and reinforcing the material in this unit.
You may have students do any combination of the activities provided, in
either whole-group or small-group settings.


~~**CORE CONTENT OBJECTIVES ADDRESSED IN THIS UNIT**~~


Students will:


  - Explain that the human body is a network of systems


  - Identify the skeletal, muscular, digestive, circulatory, and nervous systems


  - Recall basic facts about the skeletal, muscular, digestive, circulatory, and
nervous systems


  - Explain that the heart is a muscle integral to the circulatory system


  - Identify the brain as the body’s control center


  - Explain that germs can cause disease in the body


  - Explain the importance of vaccination in preventing some diseases


  - Explain the importance of exercise, cleanliness, a balanced diet, and rest for
bodily health


~~**REVIEW ACTIVITIES**~~


**Image Review**

  - You may show the Flip Book images from any Read-Aloud again and have
students retell the Read-Aloud using the images.


**Image Card Review**

  - Display Image Cards 6–10, representing each of the five body systems, in
the front of the room.


  - Hold Image Cards 1–5 and 11–14 in your hand, fanned out like a deck of cards


  - Ask a student to choose a card but to not show it to anyone else in the class.
The student must then give a clue about the picture they are holding.


Unit 2 The Human Body



**136**


 - For example, if the student draws the picture of the heart, the student
might say, “It pumps blood throughout the body.” The rest of the class will
guess what body part or organ is being described. The student who guesses
correctly will then be given the Image Card. The student must identify the
system to which the card belongs (e.g., the heart belongs to the circulatory
system) and place the card under the correct Image Card displayed in the
front of the room. Proceed to another card.


 - Hold Image Cards 15–19 in your hand, fanned out like a deck of cards.


 - Ask a student to choose a card and identify which of the five keys to health
they are holding.


 - Then have the student call on a classmate to tell why the “key” is important
to health.


**Unit-Related Trade Book or Student Choice**

 - Read a trade book to review a particular event; refer to the books listed in
the unit Introduction.


 - You may also choose to have the students select a Read-Aloud to be
heard again.


**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**

 - Give students a key vocabulary word such as _nutrients_ . Have them
brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear the word, such
as, “things the body needs to live,” “healthy parts of food,” or “carried by
the blood.”


 - Write these on the board/chart paper for reference.


**Riddles for Core Content**

 - To review the core content, ask students riddles such as the following:


   - You cannot see me but I live everywhere, on everything, and I can make
you very sick. What am I? _(germs)_


   - I am a process milk undergoes to make it safe to drink. What am I?
_(pasteurization)_


   - I am a diagram that helps people create meals for a balanced diet. What
am I? _(food pyramid or plate)_



Image Cards 15–19



Unit Review
**137**


**138**



**Write About It: A Healthy Day**

 - Review the five keys to health with students and the key components of a
fiction story _(characters, plot, setting, etc.)_ . Have them write a story about a
boy or girl who practiced all five keys to health in one day. Have them detail
how they practiced each of the five keys.


**Class Book: The Human Body**


Materials: paper, drawing tools

 - Tell students that they are going to make a class book to help them
remember what they have learned thus far in this unit.


 - Have students brainstorm important information about the body systems,
the food pyramid, and five keys to healthy living. Have each student choose
one thing to draw a picture of and then write a caption for the picture.


**Note:** You may wish to encourage students to choose/draw different things
from their peers, so all of the different topics are represented in the class
book.


 - Bind the pages to make a book to put in the class library for students to read
again and again.


Unit 2 The Human Body


**Grade 1 Unit 2|**
##### Unit Assessment


This Unit Assessment evaluates each student’s retention of unit and
academic vocabulary words and the core content targeted in _The Human_
_Body_ . The results should guide review and remediation the following day.


There are three parts to this assessment. You may choose to do the
parts in more than one sitting if you feel this is more appropriate for your
students. Part I (Vocabulary Assessment) is divided into two sections: the
first assesses unit-related vocabulary, and the second assesses academic
vocabulary. Parts II and III of the assessment address the core content
targeted in _The Human Body._


~~**PART I**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.7.F; TEKS 1.9.D.i**~~


**Directions:** I am going to ask a question using a word you have heard in the
Read-Alouds. If the answer to the question is “yes,” circle the thumbs-up on
your paper. If the answer to the question is “no,” circle the thumbs-down on
your paper. I will read each question two times. Let’s do the first question
together.


1. **Organs** : Are most of the organs of your body on the outside where we can
see them? _(thumbs-down)_


2. **Skeleton** : Is the skeleton the frame that supports the body and is made up
of the bones? _(thumbs-up)_

~~**PART II**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.7.F; TEKS 1.9.D.i; TEKS 1.9.D.ii**~~


**Directions:** In each row of pictures, you will look out for specific things.
Let’s do the first one together. More than one response option may be
correct.


1. Look at each of the pictures in the first row. The first picture is a picture of
a spine. The middle picture is a picture of a stomach. The final picture in the
row is a picture of a skull. Circle the pictures that show parts of the skeletal
system. The first one has been done for you. Which picture is circled?
( _spine_ ) The picture of the spine is circled because it is an important part of
the skeletal system. What other picture(s) in the first row show(s) parts of
the skeletal system? ( _skull_ ) Draw a circle around the skull.


2. In Row 2, the first picture is a picture of blood vessels. The middle picture is
a picture of hand muscles. The final picture in the row is a picture of biceps.

##### Culminating Activities


~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


Please use the final two days to address class results of the Unit Assessment.
Based on the results of the Unit Assessment and students’ formative assessments,
you may wish to use this class time to provide remediation opportunities that target
specific areas of weakness for individual students, small groups, or the whole class.


Alternatively, you may also choose to use this class time to extend or enrich
students’ experience with unit knowledge. A number of enrichment activities are
provided below in order to provide students with opportunities to enliven their
experiences with unit concepts.


~~**REMEDIATION**~~


Remediation opportunities include:


  - targeting Review Activities


  - revisiting lesson Applications


  - rereading and discussing select Read-Alouds


~~**ENRICHMENT**~~


**Making a Well-Balanced Meal**


Materials: drawing tools

  - Tell students to create a healthy meal to fill the empty plate pictured on
Activity Page CA.1.


  - Explain that their drawing should include all food groups: grains, fruits,
vegetables, protein (meat and beans), and dairy.


Unit 2 The Human Body



**142**


**Questions for Families**

  - Model for students what a list looks like.


  - Have students write a list of questions of things they still want to know about
the human body or healthy living. Students can share their list of questions
with their families.


**Chef Steph’s Assistants**


Check school policy regarding food

  - If you have access to a kitchen, you may want to have students bring in
vegetables and stock to make a healthy soup one day.


  - Alternatively, you could make simple pizzas using English muffins, tortilla
shells, or another prepared dough. This would also be a good opportunity to
involve parents in a fun activity with their children.


**Guest Presenter**

  - Invite the physical education teacher or a local sports person to present a
lesson on exercise and its benefits for a healthy body.


**A Soapy Solution to Germs**


Materials: Petroleum jelly, soap, water, glitter

  - To show the importance of washing hands with soap and water, invite
students to put a very thin coat of petroleum jelly on their hands.


  - Explain that in this activity, the petroleum jelly is used to represent oils that
are naturally in students’ skin.


  - Now invite students to sprinkle a little glitter on their hands and to rub their
hands together.


  - Explain that the glitter in this activity represents germs, or substances that
cause disease.


  - Invite students to wash their hands using only water. They will notice that
when washing their hands with water only, the “germs” do not wash away
but instead stay firmly attached to the “oils” in their skin.


  - Now invite them to wash their hands with soap and water. Students will
notice that by using soap, the “germs” are washed away.
