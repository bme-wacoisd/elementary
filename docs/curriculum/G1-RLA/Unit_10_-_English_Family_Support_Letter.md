# **Welcome!**
### **Grade 1, Unit 10**
## **Adventure Stories: Tales** **from the Edges of the World**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will be introduced to adventure stories set around the world and will
be challenged to dig into the adventures through research.

### **What's the story?**

Students will study the careers of **real-world explorers** like Admiral Robert Peary and
Matthew Henson, and will marvel at the **inventions** of Jacques Cousteau. They will also
research some of the ways humans have **confronted challenges** at the edge of the world,
from the oceans below to space above.

### **What will my student learn?**

Students will learn about the **science and technology** that enable adventures. They will
learn to **think critically** and learn valuable lessons on how **teamwork, perseverance,** and
**collaboration** can make greater adventures possible. By listening to the Read-Alouds and
trade books, students will **increase** their **vocabulary** and **reading comprehension** skills.


Students will explore the genre of **research writing.** Each lesson will build students'
understanding of the **research process,** including **brainstorming,** **asking questions,**
**gathering information** from texts, and **writing** about what they have learned. Students
will write a paragraph about their chosen adventure topic and will share what they have
learned about adventures in an **Adventure Gallery Walk.**

### **Conversation starters**

Ask your student questions about the unit to promote discussion and continued learning:

characters of the story? What was the setting and the plot of the story?

2. Can you tell what Eugenie Clark discovered about sharks?

3. Can you tell me about Matthew Henson's journey to the North Pole and the team he
relied upon to get there?
**Follow up:** What do you think makes a team valuable?


4. Who is Sophia Danenberg? Tell me about her adventure.
**Follow up:** Do you know the meaning of the phrase "If at first you don't succeed, try, try
again"? Tell me about a time you had to try something many times before you could
master it.
