**Edition 1**

# Teacher Unit Internalization Protocol


**Purpose**


The Unit Internalization Protocol is the process by which teachers understand what
students will be learning, how students will be assessed, and the high-level arc of
learning over the course of the unit. This understanding of how the unit progresses is
critical to the lesson internalization process so that teachers understand
how each lesson fits into the big picture to move students’ progress forward.


Step 1: **Understand the big picture.**






**•** **Use the Unit Introduction:** Write or discuss 3-5 key takeaways students should have by the end of the unit. You
will refer to this when using the lesson internalization protocol; identify background knowledge from previous
grade levels.

**•** **Use the Scope and Sequence/Pacing Guide provided by your district:** Note which days you will be teaching
the lessons and administering the assessments.

**•** **Reflect:** Why is this domain important? How does it connect to the prior domain (if applicable)?

Step 2: **Know your destination.**

**•** **Use the Table of Contents to locate the unit assessment.** If applicable, read and complete the end of unit
assessment as the students would, identifying the key sections of the assessment. Create an examplar of
what mastery should look like on the unit assessment. Identify the literacy skills students need to be
successful on the assessment. Highlight the embedded supports you will use to ensure students with
disabilities, gifted and talented learners, and emergent bilinguals can all access grade-level content.

**•** **Use the TEKS Correlation Chart in Teacher Resources:** review the TEKS and ELPS being taught; highlight the
TEKS and ELPS that are being assessed. Read and understand what students should be able to do.

**•** **Use the Unit Introduction:** Identify the formal writing piece students will complete during this unit.

**•** **Reflect:** How will identifying the skills that students will need to be successful on the unit assessment impact your
daily instruction throughout the unit?

Step 3: **Examine the arc of learning.**

**•** **Use the Table of Contents:** Review how the lessons build on one another. Refer back to the Unit Introduction
as needed to see how each skill area is developed across lessons; identify how the lessons connect to the unit
assessment; identify length of the unit and number of pausing point days.

**•** **Reflect:** How will you support students who do not have the prior knowledge for the unit?

Step 4: **Organize your resources.**

**•** **Use the Unit Introduction:** Review the instructional materials and additional resources recommended
throughout the domain.

**•** **Reflect:** What would you like the Special Education and ESL teacher to do based on what you know about the
unit? How will those actions contribute to improved student outcomes?
