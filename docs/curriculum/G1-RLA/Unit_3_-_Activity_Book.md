Dear Family Member,


### 1.1 Take-Home



During the next several days, your student will be learning about the Maya as part
of a unit on early American civilizations. Your student will learn about the importance of
farming and the cities that grew where people settled. Your student will also learn about
the existence of leaders called kings as well as the importance of the stars and planets in
Mayan traditions. Below are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to
reinforce what your student is learning about the Maya.


1. Where Are We?


Have your student locate the region where the Maya lived (Yucatán Peninsula and
Mexico) on a world map or globe. If you do not have a world map at home, you may be
able to obtain one at your local library. Talk about the geography and climate of this area.
(tropical rainforest, hot)


2. Draw and Write


Have your student draw and/or write about what they have learned about the
Maya and then share the drawing with you. Ask questions to help your student use the
vocabulary learned at school.


3. Sayings and Phrases: “The More the Merrier”


Your student has learned the saying “the more the merrier.” Talk with your student
about the meaning of this saying. (The more people who are involved in something, the
more fun it will be.) Point out times when the saying applies in your daily life.


4. Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read to your student each day. The local library has many
books about early American civilizations, including books about the Maya and Mayan
civilizations.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they have
been learning at school.
