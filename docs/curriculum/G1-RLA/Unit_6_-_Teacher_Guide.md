Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


**Grade 1 | Unit 6**
##### Introduction


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching the _Animals_
_and Habitats: The World We Share_ unit. The Teacher Guide for _Animals and Habitats: The World We Share_
contains nine daily lessons, each of which is composed of two distinct parts, so that the lesson may be
divided into smaller chunks of time and presented at different intervals during the day. The entire lesson
will require a total of sixty minutes.


This unit includes a Pausing Point following Lesson 4. At the end of the unit, a Unit Review, a Unit
Assessment, and Culminating Activities are included to allow time to review, reinforce, assess, and
remediate content knowledge. You should spend no more than fifteen days total on this unit.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


At the back of this Teacher Guide, you will find a section titled “Teacher Resources.” In this section
you will find the following:


  - Animal Cards


  - “Eletelephony” by Laura Elizabeth Richards


  - Activity Book Answer Key


  - Measures of Text Complexity


  - Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Correlation Chart


  - English Language Proficiency Standards Correlation Chart


~~**UNIT COMPONENTS**~~


Along with this Teacher Guide, you will need:


  - Flip Book for _Animals and Habitats: The World We Share_


  - Image Cards for _Animals and Habitats: The World We Share_


  - Activity Book for _Animals and Habitats: The World We Share_


  - Digital Components for _Animals and Habitats: The World We Share_


All unit components’ materials can also be found in the digital version provided with the online
materials.


Introduction
**1**


~~**WHY ANIMALS AND HABITATS ARE IMPORTANT**~~


This unit will introduce students to the wonder of the natural world, focusing on the
interconnectedness of all living things with their physical environment and with one another.
Students will learn what a habitat is and will also learn to identify specific types of habitats and
their related characteristics. They will learn to recognize different plants and animals as being
indigenous to specific habitats and will begin to develop an understanding of several fundamental
principles of nature. They will learn, for example, that animals and plants typically live in those
habitats to which they are best suited, often possessing unique characteristics or features that
resulted from adaptation to the climate and conditions of a given environment. They will also be
introduced to simple classifications of animals according to the types of food they eat and will begin
to understand the notion of a food chain.


In later grades, students will build upon the knowledge of habitats and animals that they will
have gained from listening to and discussing the Read-Alouds in this unit. The concepts and
factual information that they learn now will serve as the basis for later, in-depth understanding of
increasingly detailed and sophisticated biological taxonomies, the interdependence of all of nature
and its fragile balance, and an appreciation of the role that human beings must assume to protect
the world in which they live.


This unit also provides opportunities for students to build content knowledge and draw connections
to the science and social studies subject areas. At times throughout the unit, you may wish to build
on class discussions to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands
of Organisms and Environments, Scientific and Engineering Practices, and Recurring Themes and
Concepts from the Science TEKS, as well as to the strand of Geography from the Social Studies
TEKS. This content is not a replacement for grade level science and social studies instruction. For
more information about the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity
of the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED**~~


The following units, and the specific core content that was targeted in those units, are particularly
relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _Animals and Habitats: The World We Share_ . This
background knowledge will greatly enhance students’ understanding of the Read-Alouds they are
about to enjoy:


**Plants: How Do They Grow? (Kindergarten)**


**Farms: From the Ground Up (Kindergarten)**


**Seasons and Weather: As the Earth Turns (Kindergarten)**


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share
**2**


~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR ANIMALS AND HABITATS: THE WORLD WE SHARE**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _Animals and Habitats: The World We_
_Share_ in the forms in which they appear in the Read-Alouds. Boldfaced words in the list have an
associated Word Work activity. The inclusion of the words on this list does not mean that students
are immediately expected to be able to use all of these words on their own. However, through
repeated exposure throughout all of the lessons, they should acquire a good understanding of
most of these words and begin to use some of them in conversation.

~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit, students will explore informational writing. Students will keep a habitat journal
throughout the unit. They will add a journal entry for every habitat they learn about, which includes
writing sentences and drawing pictures. In addition, students will create an idea web graphic
organizer about endangered species.


The following activities may be added to students’ writing portfolios to showcase student writing
within and across units:


  - Habitat Journal (Lessons 2–8)


  - Endangered Species Idea Web (Lesson 9)


  - any additional writing completed during the Pausing Point, Unit Review, or Culminating Activities


~~**FOUNDATIONAL ORAL LANGUAGE**~~


The Think-Pair-Share and Turn-and-Talk prompts throughout the unit provide opportunities to teach
and reinforce how to communicate by using conventions of language, speaking when recognized,
and making appropriate contributions to discussion.


  - You can also reinforce these ideas by modeling using an appropriate pace, recognizing students’
individual contributions to group discussions, and pointing out conventions of language.


  - Explain to students that when working in whole/small groups, group members share responsibility
for the work they do together. To work effectively and respectfully, everyone should recognize the
contributions made by each group member. For example, as group members discuss a text, each
group member can share thoughts and reactions. If preparing to return to a whole-group discussion,
group members can summarize the group’s ideas by including contributions from everyone in the
group.


  - Consider using a discussion checklist that tracks student participation, as well as introducing
discussion techniques that enhance participation. ~~**TEKS 1.1.C; TEKS 1.1.D**~~


**TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using the conventions of language;
**TEKS 1.1.D** Work collaboratively with others by following agreed-upon rules for discussion, including listening to others, speaking when recognized, and making
appropriate contributions.

**Speaking and Listening:** Students will distinguish between living and nonliving things.


~~**TEKS 1.1.A; TEKS 1.1.C**~~


~~**CORE CONNECTIONS**~~


  - Ask students to explain how they know if something is living or nonliving.
_(Answers may vary.)_


  - Explain that all living things need food and water. People, plants, and animals
are all living things because they all need food and water to stay alive.


  - Explain that most living things also grow and change during their lives and do
not always look exactly the same. Living things can also reproduce, or make
new living things that look like them.


  - Explain that nonliving things do not need food or water because they are
not alive.


Check for Understanding


**Vocabulary:** What does it mean if something is living? _(It needs_
_food and water to stay alive.)_ What does it mean if something is
nonliving? _(It does not need food and water to stay alive.)_


  - Direct students’ attention to the Living/Nonliving T-chart you prepared in
advance. Read the column headers and explain that together you will sort
items into the categories.


  - Pair students and pass out the images of living and nonliving things you
prepared in advance.


**TEKS 1.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and answer questions using multi-word responses;
**TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using

 - Ask student pairs to discuss their image. Explain that students should be
prepared to describe their image, identify it as living or nonliving, and explain
why they would place it in that category.


 - Have student pairs present their images to the class and discuss them.
Have them place the images in the appropriate column on the T-chart.


 - When all images have been sorted, review the images in each category.


~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION OR TERMS**~~


 - Explain that living things generally live in a place that is just right for them.
Explain that “just right” means perfect or a good fit.

**Show Image 1A-1: Rattenborough**
**the explorer**

Greetings, fellow adventurers. You are here

to learn something new and, believe it or not,

I’m here to teach it to you. I know you may

be wondering what you could possibly learn





from a rat climbing out of a dumpster, but I am

Rattenborough, the famous rat adventurer.



I travel the world looking at plants and animals and all the different places they

call home. I’m going to take you on a special adventure all around the world.

You’re going to learn about some amazing and incredible places and animals.

And we’re going to start our exciting journey right here! I know, I know—it

doesn’t look like much, but it’s special to me, and it has everything I need.


**Show Image 1A-2: Alleyway**

Welcome to my home. This is the alleyway

where I live. Take a look around. What do you

see? ~~_[Ask students to name what they see in_~~

~~_the picture.]_~~ There are trash cans; litter; boxes;

drains and dripping pipes; old buildings and





gutters. It’s a perfect home for a rat. It has

everything I need to live.

**TEKS 1.6.G** Evaluate details to determine what is most important with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.9.D.ii** Recognize
characteristics of informational text including features and simple graphics to locate or gain information; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use

Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


All living things need food and water to **survive** . ~~Survive~~ ~~_means to stay alive._~~

Animals, like me, also need **shelter** . ~~_A shelter is something that protects from_~~

~~_weather or danger. A house or an apartment can be a shelter; a tree can also_~~

~~_be a shelter._~~ So, animals need food, water, and shelter to stay alive. My food

comes from these trash cans and the litter on the street; my water comes

from the gutters, drains, and pipes; and my family and I have a shelter down

under some steps nearby. All of these things make up my **habitat** . A habitat is

a place where an animal or plant lives that has everything needed for survival.

It’s true that my home the alleyway is not considered a natural habitat, like

a forest or a pond; but some types of animals can survive in human-made

habitats if they provide the right kinds of food, water, and shelter.


What are the three things animals need to survive? ~~_[Pause for students to_~~

~~_reply, naming food, water, and shelter.]_~~ If a place lacks any of these three

things, then it’s not a good habitat.


Animals and plants usually live in habitats that are just right for them.

Just as people can’t live underwater or in the air, plants and animals can’t

all live in the same sorts of places. You don’t hear about elephants living

near the North Pole on all that ice, and you definitely don’t hear about polar

bears living in the desert! Pumpkins don’t grow in the sea, and fish don’t

live in trees.


**Show Image 1A-3: Friendly climate for rats**

I can tell you firsthand that rats can’t live just

anywhere in the world. I don’t like the weather

to be too cold, and I need to live in a place

where food is easy to find! That’s why I like my

cozy little shelter under the steps: it is warm



Challenge


Explain that _firsthand_
means based on
personal experience.
Rattenborough explains
that he knows firsthand
that rats can’t live
just anywhere. Ask
students to explain what
Rattenborough means.


Support


The word _park_ can
also mean to leave a
car, truck, or other
vehicle in a certain place.
Refer to Poster 1M in the
Flip Book for additional
support on the multiple
meanings of _park_ .







enough for my family and me, there is always

plenty of water, and there is always a good

supply of food in the trash.


**Show Image 1A-4: Park**

Let’s look around. You might have a park like

this somewhere near your neighborhood. ~~_Here_~~

~~_the word_~~ ~~park~~ ~~_means a public area of land that_~~

~~_is used for recreation and exercise._~~ People like

to spend time playing and relaxing in this park.

But it’s a habitat for many other things, too!



Lesson 1 What Is a Habitat?
**13**


The grass, trees, flowers, and bushes in this park have what they need to live.

~~_Have you ever seen a park? What kinds of plants live in the park habitat in_~~

~~_your neighborhood?_~~


**Show Image 1A-5: Park animals**

The animals that live in the park share it as a

habitat. That includes the birds that fly around

looking for crumbs to eat; the squirrels, owls,

and chipmunks that live in those trees; the

bees, fireflies, and mosquitoes buzzing about;





the raccoons and opossums that come out at

night; and even the frogs and fish in the

pond nearby.



Check for Understanding


**Evaluate an Idea:** Where do you think these animals might find
food, water, and shelter in the park habitat? _(Answers may vary,_
_but may include: food—food left behind by people, plants, tree;_
_water—puddles, a pond, a stream or creek; shelter—trees, in_
_the ground.)_


**Show Image 1A-6: Arctic landscape**
~~_What do you see in this picture?_~~

This is a picture of a place called the Arctic.

Do you think you could live easily in the Arctic,

with its very cold temperatures and snow
covered ground? Not many things can live





there, but later I’m going to show you some

incredible plants and animals that do live in

the Arctic.


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share

**Show Image 1A-7: Several places where**
**people have made habitats**
~~_What do you see in this picture?_~~

Most animals have to live in habitats that

are specific to them. But you human beings

are very clever: you can build habitats for

yourselves! If you want to live in the desert,

where there isn’t much water with which to



grow food or to drink, you can build a pipeline to bring you water for watering

crops or for drinking. You can have food transported to the desert by road or

rail because it would be difficult to grow food in the desert, and you can build

houses for shelter so you don’t have to sleep in the sand. In fact, people like

you have been able to live in extremely hot, cold, and dry places.


**Show Image 1A-8: Earth**

We’re going on an adventure that will take us

all over our amazing planet Earth. Over the

next several weeks, I’m going to show you

some fascinating animal and plant habitats

that might be quite different from yours. You’ll







see some wonderful and unusual places where

things can live.


**Show Image 1A-9: Rattenborough packing**
**his gear**

I can’t wait to show you all these interesting

places, but first I have a lot to pack. Because

we’re going all over the world, I’m going to

need a backpack full of gear. So hold on to

your whiskers—I mean hats—and get ready

for a marvelous adventure!

**Vocabulary:** What is a habitat? [Ask students to think about the
text and the pictures to help them answer.] _(a place where an_
_animal or plant lives that has everything needed for survival)_


1. **Literal.** Describe Rattenborough’s habitat. _(lives under steps in an alley;_
_gets food from the trash cans; gets water from the drains and pipes)_


2. **Inferential.** Would Rattenborough be able to live in his habitat without food,
water, or shelter? Why or why not? _(No, he needs food, water, and shelter to_
_survive because he is a living creature.)_


3. **Inferential.** Why can’t all plants and animals live in every place on Earth?
_(They have to live in a place that provides everything needed for them to stay_
_alive. Animals and plants live in a place that is just right for them.)_


4. **Evaluative.** Describe your habitat. Where do you find food, water, and
shelter in your habitat? _(Answers may vary.)_

**Think-Pair-Share:** How is your habitat the same and/or different
from Rattenborough’s habitat? _(Answers may vary, but should_
_include discussion of food, water, and shelter.)_


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


~~**WORD WORK: SHELTER (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard that “animals need food, water, and shelter to
stay alive.”


2. Say the word _shelter_ with me.


3. A shelter is something that protects from weather or danger.


4. The two friends looked for shelter when it began to rain.


5. What other kinds of things could you use as a shelter? Try to use the word
_shelter_ when you talk about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide
and/or rephrase students’ responses: “A could be used as a shelter.”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity as a follow-up.** I am going to name a few
items and you should decide if it could be a shelter or not. If you think it
could be a shelter, say, “That’s a shelter.” If you don’t think it could be a
shelter, say, “That’s not a shelter.”


    - a house _(That’s a shelter.)_


    - a pencil _(That’s not a shelter.)_


    - school _(That’s a shelter.)_


    - a cave _(That’s a shelter.)_

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Application**

 - Display Habitat Poster 1.


 - Create a Habitat Journal for each student. Gather eight pieces of paper for
writing and drawing and then two additional pieces of paper to create a front
and a back cover. Staple all of the pages together. Write “Habitat Journal”
on the front cover of each one, or have students write it at a later time with
your guidance.


 - Write each of the following words on large cards or pieces of chart paper for
display: _Climate_, _Water_, _Ground_, _Plants_, _Animals_, _Adaptations_ . You may wish
to add an image to each card to help students identify the characteristic. You
will use these cards throughout the unit as you review characteristics of each
habitat so you may wish to create them in order to take notes next to, but not
on, them.


**Note to Teacher**


The Habitat Poster you display for this lesson, and for future lessons, can
be cut out of the Flip Book. You will see a faint dotted line at the top of each
Poster, indicating where to cut.


The characteristic cards you create will serve as the basis for discussion
each time you and your students discuss characteristics of a habitat. The
cards are intended to call out important categories but to also allow you to
flexibly use and place them as needed.


Beginning in this lesson, students will add information to a Habitat Journal.
Students will write and draw about each habitat they learn about in the unit.


**Universal Access**

 - You may wish to gather additional images of the Arctic tundra, Arctic Ocean,
and animals that live in these habitats to share with students.


 - You may also wish to gather images of animal hooves, earmuffs, and
snowshoes to help students understand characteristics of various Arctic
animals’ bodies as described in the Read-Aloud.

**Show Image 2A-2: Rattenborough in Arctic**

~~_What do you see in this image?_~~

Hello again, Rattenborough the adventurer

here to take you on a tour of one of the coldest

habitats on earth: the Arctic **tundra** . In the

tundra, there aren’t very many plants. In fact,





there are no trees at all, and a rat like me has

to wear long johns ~~_or a warm layer of clothing_~~

~~_under regular clothes_~~ and mittens.



The wind here is incredibly strong, which makes the air feel even colder. The

ground is frozen and nearly everything is covered in ice. In the winter, daylight

lasts only a few hours, and at times the sun does not come out at all. Some ice

will still be here in the summer, but in the summer, the top layer of ice melts

so that the ground gets wet and muddy. The temperatures here are so low

that most people and animals would freeze. All of these things make the Arctic

tundra one of the least friendly habitats on Earth for plants and animals.


**Show Image 2A-3: Arctic plants**

Some plants and animals can only live in the

Arctic tundra in the summer months when the

temperature is warmer, but some are able to

live there all year long. Arctic plants grow very

close together and do not grow very tall, which





keeps them from being blown away by the

Arctic winds. The kinds of plants that can live in the Arctic tundra are mosses

and different types of grasses. For once, I’m one of the tallest things around!


**Show Image 2A-4: Muskox**

The animals that call the Arctic tundra habitat

home all year round have **adapted** to the

harsh conditions. When a species has adapted

to a habitat, that means it has changed over

time and now has special traits that help it





live in that habitat. For example, the heavy fur

coats grown by many animals in the Arctic

are an adaptation to survive in the cold temperatures. This creature is

called a muskox. The muskox’s long, shaggy coat has an extra layer of hair

underneath that keeps him warm when the temperature is cold enough to

turn a rat into a popsicle, and it sheds its extra coat of hair in the warmer,

summer months. ~~_What do you do when the weather outside is cold?_~~


Muskoxen travel in herds so they can huddle together for added warmth.

~~Muskoxen~~ ~~_is the plural for_~~ ~~muskox~~ ~~_—one muskox, but many muskoxen._~~ Their

hooves ~~_which are hard coverings on some animals’ feet_~~ are very wide to keep

them from slipping on the snow and ice. In the winter, muskoxen use their

sharp hooves to dig under the snow to find plants to eat.


**Show Image 2A-5: Wolverine**

Here comes an animal I want to stay hidden

from. This is a wolverine. ~~_Do you have any idea_~~

~~_why Rattenborough wants to stay hidden from_~~

~~_the wolverine?_~~ ~~(Wolverines eat small animals,~~

~~including rats.)~~ The wolverine uses its fur





coat to keep nice and warm. Like the muskox,

the wolverine has large paws to help it move

across the snow and that come in handy when

it’s trying to catch food.


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


**Show Image 2A-6: Caribou**

These animals are called caribou

[/ kaer* ə *boo/] and are part of the deer

family. They are sometimes called reindeer.

These caribou are traveling in a huge herd,

which helps to protect them against attack by

other animals.


Caribou hair traps air, which helps keep these



animals warm. Their hooves change depending on the time of year, so they

can walk and run on mushy, wet terrain, or on hard, icy terrain. Caribou also

have antlers to help them dig for grass in the snow.


**Show Image 2A-7: Arctic fox**
~~_What do you see in this picture?_~~

This Arctic fox also has a coat that changes

during the winter from a brown summer coat

into this very thick, white fur to help the fox

blend into its surroundings. The fur also covers

Arctic.







its feet so it can walk on snow and ice. Thanks

to the fox’s fur, it can hide and sneak up on

birds, hares, and rodents like me!


**Show Image 2A-8: Arctic hare**

The Arctic hare’s white coat becomes much

heavier in the winter. Its ears are smaller than

those of other hares, meaning less of its body

is **exposed** to the cold. ~~_When something is_~~

~~_exposed, it is not protected and is out in the_~~

~~_open with nothing covering it. In the Arctic,_~~

~~_any part of your body that is exposed would be_~~



~~_cold._~~ In other words, this is no place for critters with long dangly ears, unless

they have long dangly earmuffs to keep those ears from freezing! The hare’s

white coloring also helps it hide in the snow, and its back feet are wide and

large, like small snowshoes, so it can run fast in the snow.



Lesson 2 Animals of the Arctic Habitat
**27**


**Show Image 2A-9: Rattenborough in**
**the seascape**

There are other kinds of habitats in the Arctic

besides the tundra, and different kinds of

plants and animals live in these other habitats.

The Arctic Ocean is a habitat rich in sea life

and animals that rely on the sea for their food.

The water is so cold in the Arctic Ocean that

most living creatures would be able to stay

alive only a few minutes in it.


**Show Image 2A-10: Walruses**

Animals such as the walrus call the Arctic

Ocean home. These huge creatures just love

the icy water and can swim around for a long

period of time!


Walruses have adapted to life in the Arctic

Ocean by storing **blubber** under their

skin. ~~_Blubber is a layer of fat that some_~~



~~_animals have under their skin that keeps them warm._~~ Blubber prevents heat

from escaping from their bodies. Walruses also have long teeth, called tusks,

which they use almost like arms to pull themselves up out of the water and

onto the ice.


**Show Image 2A-11: Seals**

Look at these cute animals. They are seals.

Seals have blubber under their skin, just

like walruses. Some types of seals are born

covered with a layer of white fur to keep them

warm until they develop blubber.





**28**



Seals are incredible swimmers! Like fish and

walruses, seals don’t have arms and legs.

Instead, seals have flippers, and they swim by wiggling their bodies from side

to side, using their flippers to steer. They swim very fast, so they catch plenty

of tasty fish. Thankfully, they don’t eat rats!


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


**Show Image 2A-12: Polar bear**

Here comes a polar bear! Look out! Let’s hide

behind this rock, and I’ll tell you all about this

amazing creature.


The polar bear is perhaps the best known of

all the animals living around the Arctic Ocean.

These astonishing animals have adapted

incredibly well to the harsh, Arctic habitat.



Polar bears are the largest bears in the world. Male polar bears weigh up

to 1,700 pounds—that’s probably heavier than everyone in your class put

together, including your teacher. And polar bears grow up to ten feet from

head to toe. Yikes!


Polar bears are covered with a heavy coat made up of two layers of fur,

and they have a layer of blubber under their skin. Their ears and tails are

very small so that not too much of their bodies are exposed to the cold

weather. ~~_What does_~~ ~~exposed~~ ~~_mean?_~~ It’s a good thing they have all that fur

and blubber and sharp claws, because polar bears spend most of their life

living on sea ice, or chunks of ice that float in the Arctic Ocean. Sometimes

polar bears take a dip in the icy Arctic water to swim from one chunk of ice to

another, and they have webbed paws, sort of like a duck’s feet, to help them

swim. They use those mighty paws to hunt their favorite food—seals. Like all

living things, polar bears need water to survive, and they get that water from

melted snow and ice.


**Show Image 2A-13: Polar bear with cub**

Even though adult polar bears spend most of

their time living on sea ice, polar bear babies,

or cubs, are born on land. Their mothers,

female polar bears, **burrow** in the snow to

make a den. ~~_That means they dig a hole in the_~~



Support


Explain that if polar bears
had big ears and big tails,
more of their bodies would
get cold and their bodies
would have to work harder
to stay warm.





~~_snow to make a shelter._~~ ~~T~~ hey will then hide in

the den while they have their babies. They stay



in the dens with their young all winter, and in the spring they finally come

out. The cubs stay with their mothers for almost two years to learn hunting

and survival skills before leaving home.


Now, speaking of home, I really must go. It’s absolutely frigid ~~_or very, very_~~

~~_cold_~~ here, and my whisker warmers just aren’t doing the job! We’ve learned a

**30**



lot about the Arctic habitat and the animals that are adapted to survive here.

I think our next stop should be somewhere warmer, don’t you? Remember

that even habitats as extremely cold as the Arctic tundra and Arctic Ocean

can be full of life. Now, it’s not easy for me to stay hidden in all this snow, and

I can barely move with all these clothes on, so I’m getting out of here before

I’m spotted by that Arctic fox. See you next time!


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** Describe the Arctic tundra habitat. _(The Arctic tundra is very cold_
_and windy. The ground is frozen and covered with ice during the winter, when_
_there is very little sunlight. In the summer, the top layer of ice melts, and the_
_ground gets wet and muddy. It has no trees, or is treeless.)_

   - **Literal.** Describe the Arctic Ocean habitat. _(very cold water; too cold for_
_many living creatures to live in for very long; covered with a lot of ice)_


2. **Literal.** What kind of plants grow in the Arctic tundra? _(mosses and grasses)_
How have these plants adapted to the Arctic tundra? _(grow close together,_
_grow low to the ground)_


3. **Inferential.** How have walruses, seals, and polar bears adapted to keep
warm? _(They have fur coats and a layer of blubber beneath their skin.)_

   - **Inferential.** How have walruses adapted so that they can move from the
water of the Arctic Ocean onto ice in and near the Arctic Ocean? _(They_
_have long tusks that they use to pull themselves out of the water and onto_
_the ice.)_


   - **Inferential.** Describe how polar bears have adapted to live near the Arctic
Ocean. _(layer of blubber, two layers of fur, small ears and tail, sharp claws,_
_webbed paw_ s)


4. **Evaluative.** Why is it important for living creatures to adapt to the
environment in which they live? _(Answers may vary, but should include the_
_fact that they need to adapt to be able to survive in the climate and find_
_sufficient food, water, and shelter.)_


Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** Is the Arctic a good habitat for a polar bear?
Why or why not? _(Yes, because the polar bear can find food_

_[seals], water [melted snow and ice], and shelter [dens].)_


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


~~**WORD WORK: ADAPTED (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In today’s Read-Aloud you heard, “The animals that call the Arctic tundra
habitat home all year round have adapted to the harsh conditions.


2. Say the word _adapted_ with me.


3. _Adapted_ has two meanings. One meaning is how a population changes over
time that allows a greater chance of survival in a particular environment.
Another meaning is how an individual can make a change to be better
prepared for or better able to do something.


4. The animals in the harsh Arctic habitat have adapted to very cold weather.


5. You heard about some types of animals that have adapted to their Arctic
habitat. Remember, the other meaning for the word adapted is how
individuals can change to be able to do something better. What people have
you learned about that needed to adapt in order to survive?


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use an Image Review activity for follow-up.** I will show you images of
certain animals you heard about today. Tell me some of the ways each
animal has adapted to the Arctic habitat. Be sure to use the word _adapted_
in your answer.


**Show Image Card 1 (Arctic Hare)**

 - How are Arctic hares adapted to the Arctic? _(It has white fur so it blends in_
_with the snow; its fur gets thicker in the winter; its ears are smaller; its back_
_feet are wide and large, enabling it to run fast in the snow.)_


**Show Image Card 2 (Caribou)**

 - How are caribou adapted to the Arctic? _(They travel in a large herd; have thick_
_hair that traps air allowing them to stay warm; have hooves that change along_
_with changing land; and have antlers that help them dig for grass in the snow.)_


**Show Image Card 3 (Arctic Fox)**

 - How are Arctic foxes adapted to the Arctic? ( _It has a coat that changes to_
_white during the winter so it blends in with the snow, and it has fur on its feet_
_so it can walk on the snow and ice.)_

    - Adaptations: characteristics of plants or animals that allow them to live in
a habitat


  - Explain that together you will use these categories to discuss each habitat in
the unit.


  - Engage students in a discussion of the Arctic habitats they learned about,
the Arctic tundra and Arctic Ocean, using the characteristic cards and the
following as a guide:


    - Climate: both are cold and windy

    - Water: some water in spring and summer from melted ice for drinking;
lots of salt water in the ocean that animals can’t drink

    - Ground: in the winter—ice and frozen ground; in the summer—wet and
muddy ground with some ice; ocean—chunks of ice floating in salt water

    - Plants: moss and grasses on the tundra

    - Animals: muskoxen, wolverines, caribou, Arctic foxes, Arctic hares,
walruses, seals, polar bears

    - Adaptations: heavy fur; fur color; unique feet characteristics (hooves,
large paws); blubber; webbed paws; sharp claws and teeth (tusks)

see in the illustration. _(Answers may vary.)_


 - Ask them to explain how it looks different from the pictures they have seen of
the Arctic. _(Answers may vary.)_


 - Explain that the temperature found in a desert is almost exactly the opposite
of that found in the Arctic: the Arctic is very cold, whereas deserts are usually
very hot; the Arctic is wet and muddy in the summer, whereas the desert is
very dry and sandy.


 - Ask students if they think the same animals that live in the Arctic live in the

~~**“ANIMALS OF THE SONORAN DESERT HABITAT” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 3A-3: Rattenborough in desert**

After nearly freezing and almost becoming

a polar bear snack in the Arctic, I thought

we should go someplace where my whiskers

and tail could thaw out and warm up, so I’ve

brought you to the desert. There are many





deserts all over the world. You know you’re in

a desert when it doesn’t rain very much. Many



deserts can also be very hot. Because it’s so hot and dry, only certain types

of plants and animals can live there.


**Show Image 3A-4: The Sonoran Desert**

Welcome to the Sonoran Desert in the

southwestern part of the United States

and the northwestern part of Mexico. The

temperature is quite hot during the day, and it

doesn’t rain very much. The heat and lack of





rain make it hard for some plants and animals

to live in the desert. They must all be specially



**40**



adapted to live in the hot weather and survive with very little rain.


How do they do it? Some plants can save and store water inside their plant parts

when it does rain. Other plants grow only in shady areas near mountains or rocks.


**TEKS 1.6.E** Make connections to personal experiences, ideas in other texts, and society with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.6.G**

Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


Because there are very few plants that can be used as shelter, the animals

that have adapted to living in the desert often seek shelter underground and

make their homes under the sand. Living underground helps them stay cool

when it gets hot, and it keeps them hidden from other animals that may want

to eat them for lunch!


**Show Image 3A-5: Saguaro cactus**

~~_What do you see in this image?_~~

Ouch! What did I walk into? Aha! Here is one

plant that lives in the Sonoran Desert. The

saguaro [/s ə *war*oe/] cactus is the world’s

largest cactus. Cacti don’t have leaves; they





have prickly spines instead, which is exactly

why it hurt so much to touch this one! ~~_The_~~



~~_word_~~ ~~cacti~~ ~~_is the plural for_~~ ~~cactus~~ ~~_—one cactus, but many cacti._~~ The incredible

saguaro lives for up to two hundred years, and in that time can grow as high

as a house and can weigh as much as several cars!


The most amazing thing about the saguaro is that it is a habitat in itself.

That’s right. Not only does it manage to live and thrive in the desert habitat,

but just by being there, it provides food, water, and shelter to many different

animals. Let me get my climbing gear out—and some gloves to protect me

from these sharp spines—and I’ll meet you at the top.


**Show Image 3A-6: Cacti**

You already know that it hardly ever rains

in the desert, but when it does, the saguaro

cactus saves and stores huge quantities of

water in its roots and stems. ~~_[Point to the stem_~~

~~_of the cactus as you talk about it.]_~~ The cactus







saves the extra water and uses it to survive

during those times when it is very dry and

does not rain.


**Show Image 3A-7: Cactus bloom**

In the spring, white flowers grow on the

saguaro. At night, when the desert cools

down, these flowers open to show sweet

nectar, which butterflies, bats, and birds

feed on before the flowers close the next day

when it once again becomes very hot. In the



Lesson 3 Animals of the Sonoran Desert Habitat
**41**


summer, red fruit begins to grow on the saguaro. Many animals eat the fruit

of the cactus.


**Show Image 3A-8: Gila woodpecker**

Here is an interesting bird called a Gila

[/ hee*l ə /] woodpecker. The Gila pecks holes

into the soft cactus with its beak to make a

nest for its eggs.





The Gila woodpecker is an **omnivore** . An

omnivore is an animal that eats plants as well

as other animals. Gilas feed on cactus fruit



Support


The word _fan_ also means
a person who likes or
admires someone or
something, such as
a sports team, in an
enthusiastic way. Refer

Book for additional
support on the multiple
meanings of _fan_ .


**42**



and berries as well as insects that have invaded the saguaro. Thankfully, I

brought a sandwich, so I won’t have to join these Gilas for a buggy lunch!


It really is way too hot for a regular rat like me to live here. I’m glad I brought

my fan with me. ~~_Here the word_~~ ~~fan~~ ~~_means an object that is used to move air_~~

~~_to make people or things cooler._~~ Interestingly enough, birds like this Gila

woodpecker can live in the desert habitat because their feathers help protect

them from the hot desert sun by trapping cool air next to their skin. Still,

most birds only go out to feed in the early morning or evening when it’s

cooler outside. From noon to late afternoon, many of these birds seek

shelter in the holes that they have dug in a cactus or in other shady places.


**Show Image 3A-9: Elf owl**

Here’s another bird that makes its home in the

saguaro cactus: the elf owl. The elf owl, the

world’s smallest owl, is only five inches long—

that’s just a bit bigger than one of your hands.

It moves into nests that have been abandoned





by Gila woodpeckers. ~~_When something is_~~

~~_abandoned, that means that it has been left_~~



~~_for good._~~ The elf owl, like most owls, is nocturnal, which means that it rests

during the day and wakes at night to hunt for food.


The elf owl is also a **carnivore** . A carnivore is an animal that eats only other

animals—no plants. It uses its large eyes to hunt in the dark night for bugs

that live in the desert. Most owls eat mice and, I’m sad to say, rats. But I think

I’m safe from the elf owl because I’m bigger than it is!


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


**Show Image 3A-10: Desert cottontail**

Oh look, here comes a desert cottontail rabbit,

another animal that lives in the Sonoran

Desert. The desert cottontail looks a little like

the Arctic hare we saw in the tundra, but it

has larger ears and longer back legs. ~~_What are_~~

~~_some ways the Arctic hare has adapted to the_~~

~~_Arctic tundra?_~~ ~~(has smaller ears so less of its~~



~~body is exposed to the cold; has white fur to blend in; has larger, wider back~~

~~feet so it can run fast in the snow)~~


Desert cottontail rabbits are **herbivores** . Herbivores are animals that eat

only plants—no animals. The desert cottontail eats grass and even cacti.


Smaller animals like the desert cottontail always need to watch out for larger

animals in the desert that might eat them. Many animals and plants are part

of a cycle called the food chain. You will learn more about the food chain in

the next Read-Aloud. Coyotes, for instance, like to eat rabbits. In fact, there’s

a coyote coming this way, so let’s stay up here and watch it.


**Show Image 3A-11: Coyote**

Coyotes are found all over the United States,

including the Sonoran Desert. As you can see,

the coyote has a light, tan-colored coat to

help reflect the sun’s rays and to **camouflage**

it. ~~_To camouflage something means to make_~~



Challenge


Ask students if they have
predictions about what
a food chain is and what
role the desert cottontail
might play in it.





~~_it blend in with its surroundings. The color of_~~

~~_the coyote’s fur blends in with the color of the_~~



~~_desert sand so it is difficult for other animals to see the coyote in the desert_~~

~~_background._~~ Coyotes are carnivores like the elf owls. Coyotes have very

good senses of smell, hearing, and vision, and they can run very fast, which

means they are excellent hunters. They are also **scavengers** . ~~_Scavengers are_~~

~~_animals that eat meat and waste left by other animals._~~ Coyotes live in dens,

which they make by burrowing into the ground. I think this one has smelled

something, because he’s just run off.


Now, I’m getting down from this cactus before another coyote comes along

to make me its dinner! It seems like rats are on the menu everywhere I go!

   - Do many plants and animals live in the desert? _(no)_ Why not? _(It is hot and_
_very dry.)_


3. **Evaluative.** How are the Arctic and the Sonoran Desert different? _(The_
_weather and temperature are very different—the Arctic is very cold; the_
_Sonoran Desert is very hot. Also, the ground in the Arctic is covered with lots_
_of ice, and the desert is covered with sand.)_ How are they the same? _(One way_

Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


~~**WORD WORK: CAMOUFLAGE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “[T]he coyote has a light, tan-colored coat to . . .
camouflage it.”


2. Say the word _camouflage_ with me.


3. _Camouflage_ means to blend in with surroundings. Often the color of the
object or animal is similar to the background, which makes it hard for other
animals to see it.


4. The Arctic hare’s white coat serves to camouflage it in the snowy
Arctic tundra.


5. What types of things could be camouflaged in green grass? [Ask two or three
students. If necessary guide and/or rephrase their answers “A could
be camouflaged in the grass.” It may help to point out that because grass is
green, objects that might be camouflaged by grass would probably be small,
green objects.]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I will describe something
to you. You should decide how you could camouflage it. For example, if I say
“a green leaf,” you could say, “I could camouflage that by placing it on green
grass.” _(Answers may vary for all.)_


    - a white piece of paper _(I could camouflage that by placing it on a_
_white floor.)_


    - a black cat _(I could camouflage that by placing it outside at night.)_


    - an Arctic hare _(I could camouflage that by placing it on a snowy surface.)_

~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED?**~~


  - Direct students’ attention to the Venn diagram you prepared in advance.
Review what a Venn diagram is and how to use it. _(A Venn diagram helps_
_identify how things are similar and different. The place where the circles_
_overlap is how the two things are similar. The places where the circles do_
_not overlap is how the two things are different.)_


  - Tell students you will use the Venn diagram to identify similarities and
differences between Arctic habitats and the desert habitat.


  - Ask students to explain how Arctic habitats and the desert habitat are
similar. _(Plants and animals in each habitat have adaptations to help them_
_survive the very difficult conditions.)_


  - Record students’ responses in the place on the Venn diagram where the
circles overlap. Tell students that you are writing down what they say, but
that they are not expected to be able to read what you write because they
are still learning all the rules for decoding. Emphasize that you are writing
what they say so that you don’t forget. Tell them that you will read the
words to them.


  - Ask students to explain how Arctic habitats and desert habitats are different.
_(The weather and temperature are very different—the Arctic is very cold and_
_a desert is very hot; the ground in the Arctic is covered with lots of ice, and the_
_desert is covered with sand; generally, there isn’t much water in the desert at_
_any given time, but in warmer months melting snow and ice provide water in_
_Arctic habitats; animals have adapted to stay warm in Arctic habitats, whereas_
_animals in desert habitats have adapted to stay cool; etc.)_


  - Record students’ responses on the Venn diagram in the appropriate
places in each circle.


  - Read the completed Venn diagram aloud to students.


**TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using

**Show Image 4A-2: Rattenborough in savanna**

Rattenborough, your intrepid ~~_or fearless_~~

adventurer here, to show you something a little

different. We’ve been talking about habitats—

the places where plants and animals live—and

we’ve spent time in three of the most extreme





habitats in the world: the freezing Arctic

tundra, the Arctic Ocean, and the scorching



Sonoran Desert. Now, I’ve come to a habitat that should be of great interest

to you. Some of the most famous animals in the world live here.


**Show Image 4A-3: African savanna**
~~_What do you see in this image?_~~

Welcome to the East African Savanna. _Savanna_

is another name for grassland, a wide-open,

vast stretch of grass-covered land. You know

you’re in a grassland when there is a lot of grass





around you, but not many trees or bushes.


The East African Savanna has very warm



**54**



weather all year round. However, it only has two seasons: the rainy summer

and the dry winter. The plants and animals that live here have had to adapt to

these two very different kinds of weather in the summer and winter. Luckily, I

brought my umbrella in case it starts to pour!

Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


**Show Image 4A-4: African savanna grasses**

Boy, I can barely see a thing in all this grass—

there’s so much of it. As the name _grassland_

suggests, grass is the most important plant

growing in the savannas. The grasses are

very **hardy**, which means they can survive

the tough conditions of their habitat—long

spells of dry, hot weather as well as heavy



rainfall and flooding. The grass has adapted to these conditions by growing

very deep roots. Even if the grass above ground is destroyed, the roots

underground survive and the grass can grow back. This grass grows very

quickly—as much as an inch per day! ~~_[Using a ruler, show students how big an_~~

~~_inch is.]_~~ The grass in your backyard might take a whole week to grow an inch.


**Show Image 4A-5: Zebras**

Yikes, I’m surrounded by hooves! That’s

because grass is food for many of the larger

animals, like elephants, zebras, gazelles, and

antelope. They chew on grass all day long.





I don’t think grass is all that tasty, to tell

the truth, but these animals depend on the

nutrients in the grass to survive. It’s all they



need to eat. ~~_[Review the words_~~ ~~omnivore~~ ~~_,_~~ ~~carnivore~~ ~~_, and_~~ ~~herbivore~~ ~~_, and tell_~~

~~_students to use one of these words to answer the following question.] What_~~

~~_do we call all of these animals that eat only grass?_~~ ~~(herbivores)~~ It would seem

that because so many animals eat the grass in the savanna every day, there

wouldn’t be very much grass left after a while. But, remember that this grass

grows back very quickly, so there’s usually plenty for the different herbivores,

like zebras and antelopes, to eat!


Check for Understanding


**Making Choices:** What is a savanna? _(a grassland, or wide-open_
_stretch of grass-covered land without many trees or bushes)_
What is one thing you might see in a savanna? _(Answers may vary,_
_but may include: grass, zebras, elephants, gazelles, antelope.)_


Lesson 4 Animals of the East African Savanna Habitat
**55**


**Show Image 4A-6: Giraffe eating from**
**acacia tree**

Grass is not the only important source of

food in the savanna. Many animals get their

meals from the acacia [/ ə *kae*sh ə /] tree.

Giraffes, with their long necks and tongues,

are able to eat twigs and leaves from the top

of the acacia. Not only are giraffes’ tongues



long, they are also very tough. It is a good thing, too, because the twigs of the

acacia tree are covered with sharp thorns that the giraffes eat along with the

twigs and leaves! ~~_Which word best describes giraffes—_~~ ~~omnivores~~ ~~_,_~~ ~~carnivores~~ ~~_,_~~

~~_or_~~ ~~herbivores~~ ~~_?_~~ ~~(herbivores)~~


**Show Image 4A-7: Elephants**

Elephants eat grass, and they like acacias,

too. They rest in the acacia’s shade and eat

the acacia leaves, branches, and seeds. They

even like to strip off the bark and chew on

it. ~~_Elephants eat grass and parts of the acacia_~~







~~_tree. Are elephants carnivores, herbivores, or_~~

~~_omnivores?_~~ ~~(herbivores)~~


**Show Image 4A-8: Acacia tree**
~~_What do you see in this picture?_~~

I think this acacia tree might be great to climb

and get a better look at the savanna, but don’t

forget that it’s covered in prickly thorns—

ouch! ~~_The thorns on the acacia tree are small_~~

~~_and very sharp._~~ Acacias have adapted well to

their habitat. Acacias have small leaves that



**56**



don’t dry out as quickly as larger leaves would in the dry, hot months. The

roots of an acacia grow very deep into the ground, which allows them to

collect water from far underground when there is not much rainfall. And their

sharp thorns help keep some animals from eating too many of the branches.

These trees are right at home in this habitat.


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


**Show Image 4A-9 Giraffe near a tree**

Animals living in the savanna have adapted to

their habitat in many ways. Some animals, like

the giraffe, have long, powerful legs so that

they can quickly run away from **predators**,

animals that hunt and kill other animals. Their

long legs also help them travel long distances

searching for food. Can you imagine a rat like



me keeping up with a giraffe or zebra? Not a chance!


**Show Image 4A-10: Oxpecker on giraffe**

Now, there’s a little bird that’s been sitting on

this giraffe the whole time I’ve been watching.

This is the oxpecker. Oxpeckers perch on the

backs of large animals. This oxpecker will use

its sharp claws to hold on to the giraffe, who





will hardly even know it’s there. The giraffe

and the oxpecker **coexist** . ~~_When two animals_~~



~~_coexist, it means that they live together peacefully._~~ The oxpecker feeds on

the fleas and ticks living on the giraffe’s body and warns the giraffe of any

predators that might be trying to sneak up on it. In turn, the giraffe will let

the oxpecker live on its back and provide the oxpecker food (fleas and ticks),

shelter, and protection from predators. The oxpecker will spend most of its

life on the giraffe’s back. What a partnership!


**Show Image 4A-11: Zebra**

So, here I am, back in all this tall grass, and I

bet you recognize the black and white stripes

of the zebra I’ve just run into. Zebras are

specially adapted to living in the savanna.

They have strong, long legs that make them





very good at outrunning lions and other

predators, and the stripes on the zebra’s legs



and body don’t just make it look pretty—they camouflage the zebra against

the grass so that predators can’t see it. Zebras eat the grass on the savanna,

so they are herbivores. ~~_What does_~~ ~~camouflage~~ ~~_mean?_~~



Support


Explain that the
relationship between the
giraffe and oxpecker is
one example of animals
coexisting. Each animal
helps the other in some
way. Some animals in
other habitats coexist
as well.


Challenge


Ask students to explain
why zebras would need
to outrun lions and
other predators and be
camouflaged in the grass.



Lesson 4 Animals of the East African Savanna Habitat
**57**


**Show Image 4A-12: Elephant**

Over there I can see the largest land animal

in the world. Can you guess what it is? This

African elephant is very big and eats up to four

hundred pounds of trees and grasses every

day! That’s about the same amount as the

weight of nine first-graders!



African elephants are adapted to the hot weather in the savanna. They have

huge ears that flap like fans to stay cool and keep away bugs. They also have

thick skin, which protects them from branches and thorns.


Do you see the trunk on that elephant? An elephant uses its trunk for all

sorts of things. The trunk is, of course, the elephant’s nose for breathing and

smelling, but the trunk is also used like a hand for lifting things, gathering

food, and even holding onto other elephants’ tails. Baby elephants, or calves,

use their trunks to grasp other elephants’ tails to keep them from wandering

away from the rest of the herd and getting lost. Elephants also use their

trunks to drink water. They suck up the water with their trunks and then put

the water from the trunk into their mouths. They also use their trunks like a

hose for showers and playtime!


**Show Image 4A-13: Lions**

These animals are lions. Lions live in groups

called prides. The females, or lionesses, do

most of the hunting. They are carnivores

that hunt zebras, elephants, and all kinds of

other savanna animals. Most groups of lions





have just one or two male lions. The male lion

is huge and incredibly strong. It has a furry



**58**



mane, powerful jaws, and fearsome claws. Unless this lion meets a stronger

lion, no other animal in the savanna habitat can match the lion’s strength

and power.


Animals that are hunted by predators are called **prey** . One of lions’ favorite

prey to hunt and eat are zebras. Zebras try to use the camouflage of their

stripes to hide in the grasses of the savanna so the lions will not see them.


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


**Show Image 4A-14: Vultures**

Up at the top of this tree I can see and hear

birds that are waiting for the lions to finish

eating so they can have dinner. These birds are

called vultures. A vulture is a scavenger, which,

as you have learned, is an animal that eats

leftovers.


**Show Image 4A-15: Food chain**

All of the animals and plants you’ve learned

about so far are part of something we call the

food chain, which is illustrated in this image.

What do you see at the bottom of the picture?

It is the savanna grass. The arrow points from

the savanna grass to the zebra because the

zebra eats the grass. The next arrow points



from the zebra to the lion because . . . you guessed it: the lion eats the zebra.

The next picture after the lion is a picture of the soil, because eventually the

lion dies and its body becomes a part of the soil. Then more grass grows

out of that soil, and that starts the chain all over again. ~~_So, a food chain is the_~~

~~_relationship of living things as food sources for other living things._~~


Next, I think we should head to a habitat that’s a bit closer to home and

explore some plants and animals that might look quite familiar to us.

But for now, I’m going to go check out more wildlife. I’ll see you later.

1. **Inferential.** Describe the East African Savanna. [Prompt students as
necessary using the characteristic cards.] _(two seasons—a dry season_
_and a rainy season; lots of grass; not many trees)_


2. **Evaluative.** How is the savanna similar to the Arctic tundra? _(Animals have_
_adapted to live in both places.)_ How is the savanna different from Arctic
habitats? _(The savanna has two seasons, dry and rainy; it is cold all the time_
_in the Arctic and there isn’t much water for drinking unless snow and ice melt;_
_the savanna is filled with tall grass that grows quickly; there is not much_
_plant life in the Arctic; grass covers the savanna; some animals coexist in_
_the savanna.)_

   - **Evaluative.** How is the savanna similar to the desert? _(Animals have_
_adapted to live in both places; some plants have roots that grow deep in the_
_ground to collect water; some plants have sharp parts to keep animals from_
_eating too much; some animals look a particular way to camouflage them_
_with their surroundings.)_ How is the savanna different from the desert?
_(The savanna has a rainy season that brings lots of water; the desert has_
_very little rain at all; some animals have long, strong legs to help them get_
_away from predators; some animals coexist in the savanna.)_


3. **Inferential.** What are some of the plants that live in the savanna? _(grass,_
_acacia tree)_ Both the grasses of the savanna and acacia trees have deep root
systems. How do these deep roots helps these plants survive in the savanna?
_(During the hot and dry summer season, when there is very little rain, the_
_roots of these plants can reach far underground where the soil is wetter and_
_dries out less quickly.)_


Check for Understanding


**Use Evidence:** Are giraffes, elephants, and zebras herbivores,
carnivores, or omnivores? How do you know? _(herbivores: giraffes_
_eat acacias; elephants eat grass and acacias; zebras eat grass)_


4. **Literal.** How do the oxpecker and the giraffe coexist? _(The oxpecker eats_
_the bugs that irritate the giraffe. The giraffe provides food and protection_
_for the oxpecker.)_


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


~~**WORD WORK: HARDY (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “The grasses are very hardy, which means
they can survive the tough conditions of their habitat—long spells of dry,
hot weather as well as heavy rainfall and flooding.”


2. Say the word _hardy_ with me.


3. Something that is hardy is able to survive in tough conditions.


4. Many plants that live in extreme climates have hardy exteriors in order to
survive there.


5. You learned that grasses in the savanna are hardy. What else might be
considered hardy? [Ask two or three students. If necessary guide and/or
rephrase students’ answers, “A might be considered hardy
because . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use an Antonyms activity for follow-up.** The opposite, or antonym, of
_hardy_ is _weak_ . Listen to the following examples. If I describe something
that is hardy, say “That is hardy.” If I describe something that is weak,
say “That is weak.”


    - Acacias have deep roots that collect water when there is not much
rainfall. _(That is hardy.)_


    - Don’t sit on the patio furniture because it is old and might fall apart.
_(That is weak.)_


    - The soldiers stayed strong despite the unbearable heat and dry conditions
of the desert battlefield. _(That is hardy.)_


    - The saguaro cactus has prickly spines and deep roots for living in the
desert. _(That is hardy.)_


    - After several very hot, sunny days, the new paint on the front porch started
to peel. _(That is weak.)_

~~**FOOD CHAIN (5 MIN.)**~~




  - Review that a food chain is the relationship of living things as food sources
for other living things.


  - Using Image Card 8 (Acacia Tree and Savanna Grass), Image Card 10 (Lion),
and Image Card 11 (Zebra), help students create a food chain of the East
African Savanna habitat. _(Zebra eats savanna grass; lion eats zebra; when_
_lion dies, it becomes part of the soil, where more grass grows; and on and on_
_like that.)_


  - Once students have created the food chain, remove one of the cards and
discuss what they think will happen to the other plant(s) and animal(s) in the
food chain. _(Answers may vary, but should include that all living things will_
_be impacted because if one living thing loses a food source, it can’t survive,_
_meaning it can’t serve as a food source for another living thing.)_


  - You may wish to use the following to promote a discussion:


    - Will all of them die, or could they find another source of food?


    - What else could those animals eat? For example, if the zebra is removed,
what else do they think the lion could eat?


    - What happens if there are no replacements? Can the animals survive
without anything to eat?


  - Explain that this is just one possible food chain in the East African Savanna.
Other food chains exist on the savanna and in other habitats.


**TEKS 1.12.B** Dictate or compose informational texts, including procedural texts.


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


~~**HABITAT JOURNAL (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Direct students’ attention to Habitat Poster 3 that you displayed and note
that it is a picture of the East African Savanna habitat.


 - Engage students in a discussion of the grassland habitat using the
characteristic cards and the following as a guide:


   - Climate: two seasons—rainy summer, dry winter


   - Water: not much during the winter but a lot during the summer


   - Ground: covered with grasses


   - Plants: grasses, acacia trees


   - Animals: zebras, giraffes, elephants, oxpeckers, lions, vultures


   - Adaptations: acacia tree has thorns to protect it from being overeaten
and deep roots for collecting water in dry weather; giraffes have long
necks and long, tough tongues to reach leaves at the top of acacia trees
and eat the thorns along with the twigs and leaves; zebras have stripes to
camouflage with grasses and strong legs to escape predators


 - Have students turn to the next blank page in their Habitat Journal and write
“Savanna” at the top. You may wish to write “Savanna” on the board or chart
paper for them to copy.


 - Ask students to write 1 to 2 sentences about what they learned about
the savanna habitat. Then ask students to draw pictures to go with
their sentences.


 - Circulate around the room, offering guidance and support as needed.


 - As students finish their savanna habitat journal entry, have them share their
writing with a partner.



Support


Have students draw
first, then describe their
drawings as a basis for
dictating a sentence.

sheet of paper, have them draw the desert habitat; and on the third sheet
of paper, have them draw the savanna or grassland habitat. Ask students to
include plants that might live in each habitat.


 - Next, hand out Activity Page PP.1.


 - Have students cut out the animals and glue them in the correct habitat.
Have each student write or talk about their work and why they placed certain
animals in certain habitats.


~~**ACTIVITIES**~~


**Image Review**

 - Show the Flip Book images from any Read-Aloud again, and have students
discuss the Read-Aloud using the images.


**Image Card Review**


Materials: Image Cards 1–11

 - In your hand, hold Image Cards 1–11 fanned out like a deck of cards.


 - Ask a student to choose a card but not show it to anyone else in the class.
The student must then perform an action or give a clue about the picture
they are holding. For example:


   - For the Arctic fox, the student may describe the habitat in which the fox
lives, what it eats, and what it looks like. The rest of the class will guess
what animal or plant is being described.


 - Proceed to another card when the correct answer has been given.


**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**


Materials: board/chart paper

 - Give students a key unit concept or vocabulary word such as _shelter_ or
_camouflage_ . Have them brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they
hear the word.


 - Record their responses on chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard
for reference.


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share



**66**


**Riddles for Core Content**

  - Ask students riddles such as the following to review core content:


    - I live in the Sonoran Desert, and I love to eat cactus fruit as well as insects.
I make my home by pecking holes in cacti. What am I? _(Gila woodpecker)_


    - I live in the Arctic and have a long, shaggy coat to keep me warm in
freezing temperatures. I have wide hooves so I don’t slip on the snow and
ice. What am I? _(muskox)_


    - I live in the Sonoran Desert. I look a little like the Arctic hare, but I have
longer ears and longer back legs. I love to eat grass and even cacti. What
am I? _(desert cottontail)_


  - You may also wish to make some of your own riddles, depending on your
students’ needs.


**Venn Diagram: Cacti and Acacia Trees**


Materials: board/chart paper

  - Create a Venn diagram with two overlapping circles on the board or chart
paper. Label the circles with simple drawings of a cactus and an acacia tree.


  - Ask students to think about how cacti and acacia trees are alike. _(Both_
_provide shelter and food for many animals; both may grow to be very tall and_
_old; both are covered with sharp parts; both have deep roots for collecting_
_water; etc.)_ Record students’ responses in the overlapping part of the circles.


  - Next, ask students to think about how cacti and acacia trees are different.
_(Cacti grow in the desert, whereas acacia trees grow in the savanna; cacti_
_do not have leaves, whereas acacia trees do; etc.)_ Record differences in the
respective parts of the circles that do not overlap.


  - Have students create sentences using information from the Venn diagram to
compare and contrast cacti and acacia trees.


**Class Book: Habitats**


Materials: paper, drawing tools

  - Tell the class or a group of students that they are going to make a class book
to help them remember what they have learned thus far in this unit.


  - Have students brainstorm important information about the animals that live
in particular habitats.


  - Have each student choose one idea to draw a picture of and have them also
write a caption for the picture.


  - Bind the pages to make a book to put in the class library for students to read
again and again. You may choose to add more pages upon completion of the
entire unit before binding the book.

**Locate Habitats**


Materials: World map or globe

 - Help students locate and identify the Arctic, the Sonoran Desert, and the
East African Savanna.


 - Discuss with students the habitat of each area.


**You Are There**

 - Have students pretend that they have been transported to the Arctic, the
Sonoran Desert, or the East African savanna.


 - Ask students to describe what they see and hear. You may wish to prompt
students with the following questions:


   - What is the weather like?


   - What kinds of plants and animals are there?


 - Consider extending this activity by adding group or independent writing
opportunities associated with the “You Are There” concept. For example:


   - Ask students to pretend they are Rattenborough describing one of the
habitats to their classmates and to write a group article about the habitat.


   - As Rattenborough they might use as writing anchors the question words
_who_, _what_, _when_, _where_, and _why_ .


**Idea Webs**


Materials: chart paper, markers, tape

 - Draw a large circle in the middle of four large pieces of chart paper.


 - Write the following habitat names in the center of the circles, one name per
circle: _Arctic tundra_, _Arctic Ocean_, _desert_, _savanna_ .


 - Divide students into four groups. Give each group an idea web.


 - Have students brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they think of
the habitat on their idea web.


 - Have them record their responses on the web, using the sound/spelling
correspondences they know so far.


 - When all groups are finished, have each group present their web, explaining
the topic and the information they added.


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


Flip Book 2M

**Multiple-Meaning Word Activity: Fan**


Materials: Poster 2M

  - Show Poster 2M (Fan).


  - Explain that in the Read-Aloud about the Sonoran Desert, students heard,
“It really is way too hot for a regular rat like me to live here. I’m glad I brought
my fan with me.”


  - Explain that in this sentence, _fan_ means an object that is used to move air to
make people cooler.


  - Have students hold up one or two fingers to indicate which image on the
poster shows this meaning of fan. _(two fingers)_


  - Explain that _fan_ also means a person who likes or admires someone or
something, such as a sport or sports team, in an enthusiastic way.


  - Have students hold up one or two fingers to indicate which image on the
poster shows this meaning. _(one finger)_


  - Point to the image of a fan cheering at a sporting event. Have students talk
with a partner about what they think of when they see this kind of fan. Tell
them you will call on a few partners to share what they came up with. Remind
them to answer in complete sentences. _(When I see this kind of fan, I think of_
_cheering, football, teams, etc.)_


  - Point to the image of the fan that is an object used to move air to make

Image Cards 1–11



**Food Chain**


Materials: Image Cards 1–11, paper, drawing tools

 - Divide students into three groups, one for each of the following habitats:
Arctic tundra, desert, savanna.


 - Give students the Image Cards associated with their assigned habitat.


 - Have students use the Image Cards to create a food chain (or more than
one, if it exists) within that habitat. Students may find some food sources
are missing from Image Cards. Students should create cards for those food
sources to complete the food chain.


 - Have each group present their food chain(s) to the class. Have students
explain the pieces they added, as needed.


 - After each group presents, remove one of the cards and discuss what they
think will happen to the other plant(s) and animal(s) in the food chain.
_(Answers may vary, but should include that living things will all be impacted_
_because if one living thing loses a food source, it can’t survive, meaning it_
_can’t serve as a food source for another living thing.)_


 - You may wish to use the following to promote a discussion:


   - Will all of them die, or could they find another source of food?


   - What else could those animals eat? For example, if the zebra is removed,
what else do they think the lion could eat?


   - What happens if there are no replacements? Can the animals survive
without anything to eat?


**Habitat Journal**


Materials: Habitat Journal, drawing and writing tools

 - Review the journal entries up to this point by having students read their
sentences about each habitat and describe their drawings.


 - Have students add additional sentences about each habitat and add more
details to their drawings.


 - With a partner or in small groups, have students create sentences describing
why each habitat is unique.

**Show Image 5A-3: Rattenborough in an oak tree**

Rattenborough here with the next thrilling

chapter in our habitat Read-Alouds. After

looking at some very exotic, ~~_or strange and_~~

~~_fascinating_~~ faraway places, I thought we could

visit a habitat that is quite common in many





parts of the United States. This is a forest

habitat. You know you’re in a forest habitat



when everywhere you look there are trees all around you!


You may be wondering why I’m up in a tree. Well, I’m enjoying the wonderful view

of a forest in North America! There are over five hundred thousand acres of forest

in this national park. ~~_One acre is about as big as an American football field._~~ Many

of you may have seen forests like this before, either in real life or in books. You

may be familiar with some of the plants and animals that live here in the Smoky

Mountains. A lot of them live in many other places all over the United States.


**Show Image 5A-4: View through the trees**

There are many different kinds of forests in

the world. The forests of the Smoky Mountains

are called **temperate** forests. A temperate

forest grows in an area that has four seasons,

including a warm summer and a cold winter,





and receives steady rainfall throughout the

year. ~~_Even though these forests have a warm summer and a cold winter,_~~

~~temperate~~ ~~_means it’s not extremely hot or extremely cold like in other areas._~~


This forest is also called a deciduous forest because it is full of deciduous

plants—trees, bushes, and shrubs that lose their leaves every fall, then grow

leaves again when the temperatures start to rise in the spring. The temperate

deciduous forest has a much friendlier **climate** than the other habitats we’ve

learned about, and it can support many different kinds of plant and animal

life. ~~_The climate of a habitat is the type of weather a place has over a long_~~

~~_period of time._~~


Check for Understanding


**Vocabulary:** What does temperate mean? _(not extremely hot or_
_cold)_ What does deciduous mean? _(loses leaves every fall, then_
_grows leaves again when temperatures start to rise in the spring)_
What is a temperate deciduous forest? _(a forest in an area that_
_experiences four seasons and that has trees that lose their leaves_
_in the fall and grow them back in the spring)_


**Show Image 5A-5: Forest**

A temperate deciduous forest is made up of

broadleaf trees like oak, maple, beech, and

elm. ~~_Broadleaf trees have broad, or wide,_~~

~~_leaves._~~ These trees grow very tall and are

thickly covered with wide leaves that are





better at collecting sunlight than trees like

pine trees that have needles instead of leaves.



Challenge


Ask students to explain
why the fruit from these
bushes and plants might
be important in a forest.



Under these taller trees, there are saplings (young trees), as well as shrubs,

bushes, and plants that bear ~~_or produce_~~ fruit. Closer to the ground grow

shorter plants like grasses and wildflowers.


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share



**76**


**Show Image 5A-6: Oak tree**

I’m going to start at the top and work my way

down so I can show you this wonderful habitat.

The tree I am standing in now is an oak tree.

This oak is very tall and is covered with leaves

and acorns. An acorn is a seed, and if it gets

planted in the forest soil, it can grow roots

and a shoot, which will eventually turn into an

oak sapling.



Like the saguaro cactus in the desert and the acacia tree in the savanna, oak

trees provide shelter and food for many animals. Owls, woodpeckers, mice,

and foxes make their homes in the branches or around the roots of the oak

tree, and acorns are food for squirrels, birds, deer, and other animals.


**Show Image 5A-7: Insect**

Look at that tasty insect! Well, the oak tree

is home for hundreds of different kinds of

insects, like the stink bug and the weevil,

which eat its leaves and acorns. Moths and

butterflies lay their eggs in the tree. Other





insects, like ants and timber beetles, live under

the bark of the oak or in dead and fallen trees.



Just as insects are drawn to the oak as a source of food, so are animals that

feed on insects. Spiders and all kinds of birds hunt for tasty bugs among

the branches of the oak tree. Bears and other animals find food here, too.

The oak tree is an amazing habitat in itself!


**Show Image 5A-8: Berry bushes**

Down on the forest floor there are all kinds of

shrubs, the fruits of which are food to many

different **species** of animals.

~~_A_~~ ~~species~~ ~~_is a group of similar organisms,_~~

~~_or living things, that can produce offspring._~~





~~_There are many different species of rabbits,_~~

~~_chipmunks, deer, bear, and other groups of_~~



~~_animals that eat the fruits of the shrubs on the forest floor. The whitetail_~~

~~_deer is an example of a species of deer._~~

Mmm, some of these blueberries are perfectly ripe, and they taste delicious.


Lesson 5 Animals of the Temperate Deciduous Forest Habitat
**77**


What a tasty treat!


Down here on the ground I can see wildflowers, grasses, and clover.

These plants, which cover the forest floor, are home to many types

of insects and are food to grazing animals such as deer and mice.


One interesting thing about the plants in a forest is that often they grow

leaning in the same direction. Isn’t that strange? ~~_Why do you think the plants_~~

~~_might be leaning in one direction?_~~ Well, they have to do that because they

are growing toward sunlight. The leaves of the big trees get all the sun; only

a small amount of sunlight gets through to the forest floor—that’s why it’s so

shady in here. The plants down here have to grow toward the sun so they can

get enough light to make the food they need to survive.


**Show Image 5A-9: Moss**

You may have seen this fuzzy green stuff

growing on rocks, trees, and the ground in the

forest or countryside. ~~_[Point to the moss in the_~~

~~_picture.]_~~ Mosses are small green plants that

grow in clumps in damp and shaded places.





They cover parts of the forest floor like a carpet

and are home to many small animals and



**78**



insects. It feels really soft to walk on—thick and spongy—and it tickles a bit!


Now we’re going to take a look at some of the animals that live here. Great

Smoky Mountains National Park is home to almost four hundred different

kinds of animals. Animals that live in the temperate deciduous forest are

adapted to living in a habitat with four seasons.


Check for Understanding


**Turn and Talk:** Name the four seasons, and describe what the
weather is like in each one. [Have a few student pairs share their
ideas.] _(fall: temperatures get cooler, some rain possible; winter:_
_cold, snow and ice possible; spring: temperatures get warmer,_
_some rain possible; summer: hot, thunderstorms with_
_rain possible)_


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


**Show Image 5A-10: Squirrel and squirrel’s**
**nest**

Let’s start with the mighty oak tree again. This

amazing tree is home to many animals, and I’m

standing at the nest of one of them—the brown

squirrel. This little animal is covered in warm,

brown fur and a long, bushy tail. Squirrels live

in holes in the trunks of trees or in nests high



up in trees like this one. Their nests are built from twigs, leaves, moss, and

grass. Squirrels use their strong back legs and sharp claws to help them leap

from tree to tree and to run up and down tree trunks, and they use their tails

to help them balance. Squirrels are omnivores and spend most of their time

looking for food. ~~_What are omnivores?_~~ ~~(animals that eat both plants and other~~

~~animals)~~ The squirrel eats mostly acorns from the oak tree, but it also eats

nuts, mushrooms, berries, seeds, and even bird eggs and insects. This squirrel

might nibble on an acorn or two now, but it will also bury and **store** ~~_or save_~~

many acorns underground so it will have them in the winter when other food is

hard to find. ~~_The word_~~ ~~store~~ ~~_also means a place to purchase things._~~


**Show Image 5A-11: Barred owl**

A barred owl lives in a hole in this oak tree.

I have to be careful, because owls are

carnivores. ~~_What are carnivores?_~~ ~~(animals that~~

~~eat other animals)~~ Unlike the elf owl in the

desert, this owl happens to enjoy eating rats!





This owl also eats other small animals like

mice, insects, and even other birds. Owls have



very good hearing and excellent eyesight, which allows them to find their prey

easily in the thick forest. Owls are nocturnal, which means they only come out

at night, so I have some time before this one is ready for a late-night snack.


**Show Image 5A-12: Black bear**

Hold on, what’s that scratching sound coming

from below? It’s a black bear! Black bears

are common in North American temperate

deciduous forests, and there are more than a

thousand in this national park. They are large





animals—they weigh as much as fourteen first

graders would weigh all together—and when



they stand on their hind legs, they can be taller than a person.


Lesson 5 Animals of the Temperate Deciduous Forest Habitat
**79**


Support


The word _bark_ can also
refer to the sound a dog
makes.



Bears are omnivores and hibernate, or sleep, during the winter in hollowed
out trees or caves. When they are hibernating, bears use less energy and do

not need to eat any food for many, many days. This is a good thing, because

during the winter the foods that bears eat are scarce and hard to find.


Bears are covered in thick, black or brown fur, and they have sharp claws to

strip the bark off trees to uncover the insects that live there. ~~_The word_~~ ~~bark~~

~~_in this sentence means the outer covering of a tree._~~ This bear will use its long,

sticky tongue to get into every crack to hunt out the insects, and they’ll make

a delicious meal for him, I’m sure.


**Show Image 5A-13: Buck**

I just saw a deer through the trees. Deer often

live in the temperate deciduous forest because

it is such a good place to stay hidden, but they

often hunt for food in neighboring meadows.

This is a buck. A buck is a male deer, and we





can tell because male deer have antlers.


Did you know that a buck’s antlers fall



off every year and will grow back again? Bucks mark their **territory** by

stripping the bark off trees with their antlers. ~~_A territory is an area in which_~~

~~_an animal or group of animals lives. Animals often protect their territory and_~~

~~_try to keep other animals out._~~ Bucks also use their antlers for fighting with

other male deer. This deer is a white-tailed deer. Its coat is tan right now,

but in the winter it will change to gray-brown, and it has patches of white

on its underside. This helps the deer to be camouflaged or hidden in the

environment. How do you think the change in color from tan to gray-brown

with patches of white in winter helps to camouflage the deer?

~~_[Pause for student responses.]_~~


**Show Image 5A-14: Doe running away**

Deer graze on grasses and eat tree leaves,

berries, and acorns, among other things.

They mostly come out to feed at night when

the light is low, and they rest during the day.

This white-tailed deer has strong, long legs





which are good for running and jumping and

for escaping from predators like wolves,

coyotes, and people.

The temperate deciduous forest’s climate can support many different plants

and animals because it has four seasons. It is called temperate because it

never gets too cold, like the Arctic, or too hot, like the Sonoran Desert. There

is a steady rate of rainfall throughout the year, so plants can grow and animals

can have food and water to keep them alive. This is just one of the many kinds

of forests in the world. Next we’re going to take a look at another kind. It’s

going to be very different in a lot of ways. I’ll see you on our next adventure.

~~**WORD WORK: STORE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “This squirrel might nibble on an acorn or two
now, but it will also bury and store many acorns underground so it will have
them in the winter when other food is hard to find.”


2. Say the word _store_ with me.


3. _Store_ means to save for future use.


4. When warm weather arrives, I store my winter hat and gloves in a box in
the closet.


5. Do you sometimes store food? What other things do you store? Try to use the
word _store_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase students’ responses: “I store . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** [Write _store, stockpile,_ and
_save_ on the board,] Some words mean almost the same thing but are still
different. The words might express more or less action. For example, _store,_
_stockpile,_ and _save_ mean to keep for future use but they are still different.
“ _Save_ ” is used when you are talking about keeping a small amount of things
for the future. “I want to save the candy bar for dessert.” “ _Store_ ” is used when
you are talking about saving a medium amount of things for the future.
“The squirrel stores nuts for the winter.” “ _Stockpile_ ” is used when you are
talking about saving a large amount of things for the future. “The town will
stockpile bottled water for everyone to have in case of an emergency.”


I am going to read a sentence that has a word missing. With a partner I want
you to decide if the word _save, store,_ or _stockpile_ fits best and explain why.


 - your lunch for later. _(save)_


 - The school will all of the books from the school for the summer.

**through rainforest**

Hello there. Rattenborough reporting from

a fascinating habitat—a habitat that has the

greatest variety of plants and animals of any

habitat on Earth. Welcome to the tropical





rainforest. Tropical places are warm and wet.

A rainforest is a thick forest of plants that



stay green year-round. So, a tropical rainforest is a warm, wet, thick forest of

plants that stay green year-round. There are tropical rainforests in many places

around the world close to the equator, but the one we are visiting is called the

Amazon rainforest. It is in South America and is the largest tropical rainforest

on Earth. The Amazon rainforest is so dense ~~_or thick_~~ that a rat like me could

easily get lost. ~~_The plants in the tropical rainforest are thick because there are so_~~

~~_many growing closely together._~~ It’s hot and very **humid** here. The temperature

is always very warm, and it rains heavily all year long. ~~_Because of the warm_~~

~~_temperature and rain, the air feels wet, or humid._~~ My fur is feeling very wet and

sticky, and it’s a good thing that I brought my umbrella. There are between

eighty and two hundred forty inches of rainfall here every year. That makes this

one of the wettest places you can find on land. ~~_[Provide students with an idea of_~~

~~_the number of inches of rainfall yearly where you live—demonstrate the amount_~~

~~_with your hands—to put the amount of rainfall in the Amazon in context.]_~~


**TEKS 1.6.G** Evaluate details to determine what is most important with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and
texts the student is able to read or hear to learn or clarify word meanings.


Lesson 6 Animals of the Tropical Rainforest Habitat
**91**


**Show Image 6A-3: Dense jungle**

Temperate deciduous forests, which you

learned about last time, have broadleaf

trees that lose all of their leaves in the fall.

The Amazon rainforest also has broadleaf

trees, but the main difference is that most of

the trees here stay green all year long. The

evergreen trees in this tropical rainforest



replace their leaves gradually throughout the year as the leaves age and fall,

so that the trees always look green and never have bare branches like the

trees in a temperate deciduous forest. Because the climate here is the same

all year round, plants do not need to slow down for cold winter weather, and

the animals that live here always have a good supply of food all year, too.


**Show Image 6A-4: Rainforest canopy**

Take a look around. The trees in the rainforest

are so tall that they grow as tall as thirteen
story buildings, ~~_or as tall as very, very tall_~~

~~_buildings in large cities_~~ and some grow much

taller than that! I’m standing in a tree right





now, and as you can see, the trees grow so

thickly and so close together here that, from

above, you can see only a **canopy** of thick, green leaves. You can’t see the

forest floor at all. ~~_In a tropical rainforest, the canopy is the top layer of the_~~

~~_forest formed by the branches and leaves at the tops of the trees._~~


Because the sun’s light can’t get through this canopy of leaves, everything

under them is really dark. I’ve brought a flashlight to help me see down there.


**Show Image 6A-5: Rain drop**

The plants in the Amazon rainforest have

adapted to this climate in many ways. Because

it’s so dark in the rainforest underneath the

canopy, most plants have large leaves so they

can catch as much light as possible. Many of





the plants have waxy leaves with ends that

are tapered ~~_or that get smaller near the ends_~~

to help the water drip off them, like the water

running off my umbrella.


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


**Show Image 6A-6: Vines in the rainforest**

Many types of vines grow in the rainforest.

Vines are climbing plants that grow on trees

or wind themselves around tree trunks. Many

animals use the vines growing among the trees

almost like sidewalks and ladders to cross

from one tree to another.



The rainforest floor is a very shady place, which means it is a good habitat

for mosses and fungi that don’t need much sunlight. If you can believe it,

there are even some plants that don’t need any light at all to grow!

They grow on the forest floor and get their energy from the rotting leaves

instead of sunlight.


**Show Image 6A-7: Kapok tree**

I’m way up in a particular type of tree found

in the Amazon rainforest called a kapok

[/ kae*pok/] tree, so high that you won’t be

able to see me! The kapok tree is one of the

tallest trees around. The kapok has a very

long trunk, and its branches and leaves form

a canopy over the plants and animals below,



making it a good shelter for animals like birds, snakes, and monkeys.


**Show Image 6A-8: Toucan, macaw, poison**
**arrow frog**

There are also many different kinds of animals

that call the Amazon rainforest home. Many

types of interesting and colorful birds, frogs,

insects, reptiles, and other animals live in





the trees and other plants of the tropical

rainforest. These huge toucans use their



large beaks to cut fruit from branches and to eat lizards, as well as other

birds. ~~_[Point to the toucan on the right side in the image.]_~~ Macaws, which

are a kind of parrot, travel in groups and use their hooked beaks to break

into hard nuts and fruits. ~~_[Point to the macaws.]_~~ And you don’t want to get

too close to the poison arrow frog, which has poisonous skin to protect it

from its predators.


Lesson 6 Animals of the Tropical Rainforest Habitat
**93**


**Show Image 6A-9: Squirrel monkey**

I’m back in the kapok tree, one of the very

tallest trees in the forest, to see what kinds

of animals call this habitat home.





Check for Understanding


**Vocabulary:** What is a habitat? _(a place where plants and animals_
_live that has everything needed for survival)_


Over there I can see a squirrel monkey. The squirrel monkey is a very friendly

little animal, and it shares a lot of things in common with the squirrels that

live in the temperate deciduous forests. The squirrel monkey is very small

and has a very long, thin tail that it uses to help balance. It has strong legs

that it uses to jump and run, and claws that help it climb up and down trees

and vines. In fact, squirrel monkeys are so good at traveling by leaping and

running along branches that they hardly ever touch the forest floor.


**Show Image 6A-10: Squirrel monkey eating**

The squirrel monkey is an omnivore. ~~_What is_~~

~~_an omnivore?_~~ ~~(an animal that eats both plants~~

~~and other animals)~~ ~~I~~ t eats insects, fruits, and

flowers, and spends most of its time during

the day moving around the forest to find food.





The squirrel monkey has excellent eyesight,

which is useful for finding small insects, fruit,



**94**



and berries growing among the green leaves of the tropical rainforest trees.

Squirrel monkeys live in large groups, making it harder for their predators—

eagles and snakes—to get them. Now, this monkey is acting a little strange,

and experience has told me that this kind of behavior usually means there’s

trouble on the way. Aha, yes, look who’s coming—some kind of snake. Snakes

also tend to eat rats, so I’m going to climb a bit higher and take a look from a

distance.


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


**Show Image 6A-11: Boa constrictor**

Wow, look at the size of this snake! It’s a boa

constrictor, one of many kinds of snakes

that live in the Amazon rainforest. It’s a

pretty big snake; this one is about thirteen

feet long! ~~_[Provide students an example of_~~

~~_something that is thirteen feet long.]_~~ Boas can

have slightly different coloring and patterns



~~_or repeated shapes or designs_~~ ~~o~~ n their skin, but they are well camouflaged

in the trees, plants, and vines of the forest.


**Show Image 6A-12: Boa constrictor**
**showing jawline**

This boa constrictor, like all snakes, is a

carnivore. It eats other animals such as bats,

which are its favorite food, rodents (yes,

rats included!), lizards, birds, and even the





small squirrel monkeys. The boa constrictor

is mostly nocturnal, so it comes out to hunt

when it’s getting dark, like now.



Snakes can eat animals that are much bigger than they are. This boa’s jaws

open very, very wide, so that when it finds an animal to eat, even animals

such as birds and squirrel monkeys, it will be able to swallow it whole.


**Show Image 6A-13: Jaguar**

The boa constrictor is not the only carnivore

in the rainforest. In fact, it will have to watch

out that it doesn’t become dinner for a

hungry jaguar, like this one. Jaguars look a

lot like leopards—they have tan fur with dark





spots—but they are bigger than leopards,

with shorter tails and legs, and bigger heads



and paws. This jaguar is about seven feet long and probably weighs around

two hundred pounds.


Lesson 6 Animals of the Tropical Rainforest Habitat
**95**


**Show Image 6A-14: Jaguar hunting**

Jaguars are very well adapted to living in the

rainforest. They have very sensitive hearing

and an excellent sense of smell. A jaguar can

see very well during the day and at night. All

these things make it easier for it to find, **stalk**,

and catch its prey. ~~Stalk~~ ~~_means to follow in a_~~

~~_slow, quiet way in order to hunt and catch._~~



Support


The word _stalk_ can also
mean the stem of a plant,
or the part of the plant
that supports it and
carries nutrients to the
rest of the plant.


**96**



I can barely hear the jaguar moving through the forest. That’s because its

paws are covered with very thick fur with pads on the bottom. Because they

can travel so quietly, jaguars don’t have to run far to catch their prey. So,

instead of having long legs for running, they have short, strong legs that are

good for pouncing on ~~_or suddenly attacking_~~ ~~o~~ ther animals from the ground,

from trees, or in the water.


A jaguar spends most of the day resting and goes out to hunt at night. It’s

also very good at climbing trees, which means I should get out of here before

it’s able to sniff me out!


I’ve moved to forest floor, near the bottom of the kapok tree, because there’s

one last, very interesting animal I want to show you. We’d better hurry—it’s

getting dark, and I may have to use my flashlight to show you.


**Show Image 6A-15: Leafcutter ants**

These are leafcutter ants. These ants burrow

underground and make nests in groups called

**colonies** . Different ants in the colony have

different responsibilities. There are worker

ants, soldier ants, and their queen. The worker





ants are traveling to the kapok tree nearby

where they will use their sharp jaws to bite off

pieces of the leaves to bring back to the nest.



Did you know that ants can carry up to ten times their own body weight?

That’s pretty amazing, isn’t it? The soldier ants are there to protect the

worker ants on their way to and from the nest. These ants spend most of

their lives working for food! Nature is amazing, isn’t it?


Well, it’s really quite dark now, and my fur has been sticking to me since we got

here, so I think it’s time to leave the hot and humid Amazon rainforest. We’ve

learned a lot about this exotic habitat, its climate, and the plants and animals

that have their homes here. Now we will go somewhere really different.

Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** You are going to identify similarities and
differences between the Read-Alouds “Animals of the Tropical
Rainforest Habitat” and “Animals of the Temperate Deciduous
Forest Habitat.”


How is the Read-Aloud about the tropical rainforest different
from the Read-Aloud about the temperate deciduous forest?
Make sure to answer using a complete sentence starting with
“They are different because .” _(Answers may vary.)_

1. In the Read-Aloud you heard that “the trees grow so thickly and so close
together here that, from above, you can only see a canopy of thick,
green leaves.”


2. Say the word _canopy_ with me.


3. A canopy is the top layer of the forest formed by the branches and leaves
at the tops of the trees. A canopy is also something that hangs or spreads
over something.


4. There is a canopy over the front doors of the store.


5. Have you ever seen a canopy? If so, where? What did the canopy cover?
Can you think of times that it might be helpful to have a canopy? Try to
use the word _canopy_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students.
If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses: “I saw a canopy
at . . .”]

**Speaking and Listening:** Students will identify different habitats.


~~**TEKS 1.1.C**~~


~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED? (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Show students the globe, and remind them that the globe shows both the
land and water that make up our planet, Earth.


Check for Understanding


**Point and Say It:** Identify what the blue parts are on
a globe. _(water)_ Identify what the parts that aren’t blue
are on a globe. _(land)_


  - Direct students’ attention to the Habitat Posters on display.


  - Ask students to try to name all of the different habitats they have learned
about so far. Record their responses on the board or chart paper. [Use a
black marker if using chart paper and white or yellow chalk if using the
board.] _(Arctic tundra, Arctic Ocean, desert, savanna, temperate deciduous_
_forest, tropical rainforest)_


  - Remind students that they may not be able to read all of these words by
themselves, but you are writing them down so you don’t forget.


  - Tell students that you are going to read the name of each habitat, and as you
do so, ask them to tell you whether the habitat is primarily a land habitat
or a water habitat. If it is a land habitat, use a green marker/chalk to circle
the name of the habitat; if it is a water habitat, use the blue marker/chalk to
circle the name of the habitat.


  - After going through the list of habitats, ask students to identify how many
land habitats and how many water habitats have been discussed so far.
_(land–5; water–1)_


**TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using

Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


 - Ask students what they notice about the difference in number between land
and water habitats learned about so far. _(They have learned about more land_
_habitats than water habitats.)_


 - Ask students to identify the one water habitat they have learned about so far.
_(Arctic Ocean)_


~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION OR TERMS (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that today they are going to learn about another water habitat:
a freshwater habitat.


 - Explain that fresh water is water that does not have very much salt in it; it is
often water that people can drink.


 - Explain that a freshwater habitat is different from the water habitat found in
the Arctic Ocean, which is called a saltwater habitat.


 - Explain that the water found in oceans is salty and therefore not for drinking.

**Show Image 7A-2: Rattenborough fishing off**
**a dock**

Hello again! Glad you could join me. I thought

that we needed a real change, so I’ve come

off dry land to a place where it’s wet all the

time—a lake. A lake is an area of water that





is surrounded by land ~~_or has land all around_~~

~~_it_~~ ~~.~~ There is a lot of water in the world; in fact,



water covers most of the earth’s surface. But, only a tiny part of the world’s

water is fresh water, the kind of water you and I can drink because it has very

little salt in it.


**Show Image 7A-3: Examples of**
**freshwater habitats**

Fresh water is found in streams, rivers, lakes,

and ponds. The water in these streams, rivers,

lakes, and ponds comes from rain and from

melting ice and snow. Isn’t it amazing to think





that the water from the drinking fountain at

school or from the faucets in your house all

comes from rain?

Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


**Show Image 7A-4: Water lilies and turtle**

I’m here at the water’s edge ~~_or where the water_~~

~~_and land meet_~~ to explore this lake and the

plants and animals that call this **freshwater**

habitat home. Freshwater habitats have many

kinds of fish, birds, insects, and other animals.

Standing here, I can see an enormous ~~_or very_~~

~~_big_~~ leaf in the water. Let me climb onto it so

we can get a closer look.



This is a water lily leaf. ~~_[Point to the water lilies in the picture.]_~~ A water lily

is a plant that lives in water near the edges of ponds and lakes. Plants are

important in freshwater habitats because they make oxygen for animals to

breathe; plants are also food for the animals to eat, and they can provide

shelter to protect animals from their predators. ~~_Remember, a predator is an_~~

~~_animal that hunts other animals._~~ The leaves of the water lily are very large,

round, and green, and they **float** on the surface of the water. ~~_If the leaves_~~

~~_float on the surface of the water, that means they stay on top of the water;_~~

~~_they don’t sink._~~


**Show Image 7A-5: Water lilies, deer,**
**porcupine, beaver, turtles, and ducks**

The water lily is well adapted for living in this

habitat. Like the kapok tree in the rainforest,

the lily’s large leaves let it get as much

sunlight as it needs for food and energy.





Lilies are also food for many animals, believe

it or not. Animals—like deer, porcupines,

beavers, and turtles—all eat the leaves, whereas ducks and geese like to

eat the roots. Some animals, like fish and frogs, use the lily leaves as hiding

places, and the flowers bring bees and other insects. I am going to float

around the edge of the lake on this water lily leaf, but I’m going to have to

leave soon because this pesky turtle will not leave my leaf alone!



Challenge


Ask students to explain
why the turtle won’t
leave Rattenborough’s
lily leaf alone.



Lesson 7 Animals of the Freshwater Habitat
**107**


**Show Image 7A-6: Cattails, muskrat, geese,**
**moose, elk**

I’ve pushed out from the edge of the lake a

little, and already I can see another kind of

plant that lives here. It’s called a cattail, and it

gets its name from the unusual way it looks.

Thankfully for me, it doesn’t have much to do

with real cats! Cattails have long, thin stems



with foot-long, furry flower spikes at the top that turn from green in the early

summer to brown in the fall. The flower spike feels soft and furry and looks

a little like a cat’s tail, but I think it looks more like a hot dog! ~~_Does it look like_~~

~~_a cat’s tail to you?_~~ The plants can reach up to nine feet in height, which lets

them get as much sunlight as they need.


As with water lilies, some animals use cattails for food and shelter. ~~_[Point to_~~

~~_each animal as you talk about it.]_~~ Muskrats and geese like to eat the roots of

the cattail, and the juicy green shoots are a favorite of moose and elk. ~~_Moose_~~

~~_and elk, like caribou, are part of the deer family._~~ Many kinds of birds make

their homes among the cattails. It’s very hard to see anything in there

because cattails grow so thickly, so it’s a good place for birds to build their

nests and to lay and hatch their eggs. Predators like snakes and frogs also

live among the cattails and search for animals like birds and insects for food.

I think I’m going to move on now. As you know, I’m not very good with snakes.


**Show Image 7A-7: Rainbow trout**

Come with me beneath the water, and let’s

take a look at what’s under there. Here are

some nice-looking rainbow trout. Fish can only

live in water, and they breathe underwater

using **gills** on the sides of their bodies.





Gills take in oxygen from the water around

them. Fish have strong tails that they use for



**108**



swimming and fins that they use for steering and balance.


The rainbow trout is a carnivore. ~~_Remember, a carnivore is an animal that_~~

~~_eats other animals._~~ It eats other water animals like insects, other fish, and

sometimes shellfish. It even eats some small land animals like mice if it gets

the chance, so I’m sure it wouldn’t mind a nibble of rat! Rainbow trout like to

live in rivers, but some prefer the deeper water of big lakes.


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


**Show Image 7A-8: Bullfrog**
~~_What do you see in this image?_~~

I enjoyed exploring beneath the surface of

the water, and now I’m going to rest on a lily

pad again. While I’m drying off a bit, let me

show you a kind of frog called a bullfrog that I

can see sitting at the water’s edge. Frogs are

**amphibious**, which means they live both in



the water and on land. Bullfrogs are the largest kind of frog found in North

America, and they can grow more than half a foot long and weigh more than

a pound. That’s a really big frog!


The bullfrog gets its name from the loud, cow-like noise it makes. ~~_A male cow_~~

~~_is called a bull. What sound does a cow make?_~~ I bet birds and turtles would

be pretty surprised to know that a frog can make such a loud sound! Pretty

neat, huh? This bullfrog is resting now, but it will come out to hunt when it

gets dark. Bullfrogs eat a lot of different kinds of food. They are carnivores,

so they eat small fish, snakes, birds, and insects like this dragonfly that’s

buzzing about my head.


**Show Image 7A-9: Adult dragonfly**
~~_This is an adult dragonfly._~~ ~~Adult~~ ~~_means grown up._~~

Adult dragonflies are flying insects with long

bodies and wings. Dragonflies live around

lakes, streams, and other freshwater habitats

because they lay their eggs in water. Adult





dragonflies eat other insects like mosquitoes,

flies, and bees.



The dragonfly uses its long wings to hover around in the air ~~_or stay in one_~~

~~_place while flying_~~ where it catches its food. It has to be careful because the

bullfrog isn’t the only one that likes to eat dragonflies. Birds and turtles like

to eat them, too.


Lesson 7 Animals of the Freshwater Habitat
**109**


**Show Image 7A-10: Ducks**

The water is getting a little rough out here.

Ah, that’s why. Here come some birds that

like to eat insects. These are a kind of duck

called mallards. Ducks are birds and can live

both in and out of water, but it’s the water

where they spend most of their time. Like all

birds, ducks—like these mallards—are covered

in feathers.



Did you know that ducks’ feathers are **waterproof** ? ~~_If something is_~~

~~_waterproof, it keeps water out._~~ Ducks rub special oil from their tails all over

their feathers. Because oil and water don’t mix, water drips right off the

ducks without getting their feathers wet.


**Show Image 7A-11: Duck looking for food**

Ducks float on the surface of the water and

have large, webbed feet to help them paddle.

They dip their heads under the water and use

their beaks, which are called bills, to search

for food at the bottom of the lake. ~~_Here the_~~





~~_word_~~ ~~bills~~ ~~_refers to ducks’ beaks._~~ Mallards eat

grasses and seeds from plants, and small

animals like insects, worms, snails, frogs,

and small fish.



Support


The word _bills_ can also
refer to pieces of paper
money or documents
listing money owed to
a business, such as the
electric company. Refer
to Poster 4M in the Flip
Book for additional
support of the multiple
meanings of _bills_ .



Well, we’ve had a good look around this freshwater habitat, but I have to get

off this lily leaf before these ducks knock me off! There’s another kind of

water habitat, and we’re going to have a look at it next time. I hope you’ll

join me. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to start my long trip back to shore!

~~**SAYINGS AND PHRASES: A FISH OUT OF WATER (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students if they have ever heard the saying “a fish out of water.”


  - Have students repeat the saying after you.


  - Ask what would happen to a fish that was out of water. _(The fish would not be_
_in its usual environment or place. It would be very uncomfortable, and it would_
_be difficult for the fish to survive very long out of water. Fish can only breathe_
_underwater, using gills, so being out of the water would be bad for a fish.)_


  - Explain that the saying “a fish out of water” is used to talk about people who
aren’t in their usual place, or who are in an uncomfortable situation. People
would survive if they weren’t in their usual place or in familiar circumstances,
but they might feel a little uncomfortable or strange.


  - With a partner, have students discuss how they would feel in the
following situations:


    - You are the only person who forgot to wear shoes to school.


    - You started attending a new school and didn’t know anyone else
in your class.


  - Explain that students might feel like “a fish out of water” in these situations
because they weren’t experiencing things they were used to.


  - Ask students to think of other examples of when people might feel
uncomfortable in a new or different environment. _(Answers may vary.)_

**Show Image 8A-1: Rattenborough in a boat**

Welcome to the last habitat that we are going

to explore. In the last Read-Aloud, we explored

freshwater habitats. Now, we’re going to

learn about another kind of water habitat—a

saltwater habitat. Saltwater habitats, as you





could guess from their name, contain lots of

salt. This means that we can’t use salt water

for drinking. Would you like to drink a cup of

salty water? No thanks!



**120**

_help melt snow and ice in the winter to make roads safe.)_

Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


**Show Image 8A-2: Planet Earth**

It’s hard to imagine, but more of the earth is

covered in water than is covered with land.

Most of that water is salt water in oceans and

seas. Oceans are huge areas of salt water that

stretch all around our planet, and they are home

to almost half of the world’s species of animals

and millions of different plants. The water in



the ocean comes from rain as well as from rivers and streams that flow into

the ocean. Seas are smaller areas of salt water that have land around them or

around part of them.


**Show Image 8A-3: Coastline**

I’ve come to the largest ocean, the Pacific, to

show you a bit more about ocean habitats and

the plants and animals that live in them. ~~_[Point_~~

~~_to the Pacific Ocean on a world map or globe.]_~~

I’m standing on a beach looking out at the





water. You can see that the waves are crashing

onto the beach. This beach, and any land that



runs alongside the ocean, is called the coastline, or shoreline. Now, you may

think that when you are standing on the land looking at the water, that the

land stops where the water starts. It certainly looks that way. But let me get

my trusty scuba gear out and walk into the water.


Now that I’m in here, I’m still standing on land; it’s just that the land is under

the water. The land **slopes** downward the farther I go out into the water,

which means the water is getting deeper and deeper. ~~_[Visually demonstrate_~~

~~_with an object, such as a wooden incline block or wedge, or illustrate on the_~~

~~_board, what the word_~~ ~~slopes~~ ~~_means.]_~~


**Show Image 8A-4: Ocean floor**

The interesting thing about the ocean floor,

which is the land under the ocean water, is

that it isn’t flat. As on land, the earth beneath

the ocean waters has both mountains and

**valleys** . ~~_Mountains are areas of land that are_~~





~~_very high where the land comes to its highest_~~

~~_point. Valleys are areas of low land between two_~~

~~_areas of high land._~~ This makes some areas of

water in the ocean deeper than others.



Lesson 8 Animals of the Saltwater Habitat
**121**


The Pacific Ocean is full of both plant and animal life, but not all of them

share the same space. The conditions under the water are very different in

various places. Some parts are deep, and some are **shallow** . ~~Shallow~~ ~~_is the_~~

~~_antonym, or opposite, of_~~ ~~deep~~ ~~_—in other words, not deep._~~ There are cool parts,

and there are warm parts; some are dark, and some are full of light.


**Show Image 8A-5: Sealife**

There are plants and animals in nearly every

part of the ocean—some in the deep, open

waters far from the land, and some in the

shallow waters closer to the shore. Some

animals, like turtles, jellyfish, and crabs,





live closer to the shore where it’s shallower

and warmer.



Some animals like it better near the surface of the water, and others prefer

to live down at the very bottom of the ocean on the deep ocean floor. They

are all adapted to survive the conditions of their habitats. For instance, the

animals that live in the deeper parts of the ocean have adapted to total

darkness, because the sun’s light just can’t reach that deep.


Some fish, like the devilfish, have very large mouths and sharp teeth so that

they can catch their prey as easily as possible. Other sea creatures have

feelers on their bodies that help them feel where their food is. And some

animals make their own light with special chemicals in their bodies, like

when you carry a flashlight in the dark!


**Show Image 8A-6: Coral reef**

I have now arrived at a special part of a

saltwater habitat called a coral reef, which is

made up of many tiny animals called corals.

Corals stay in one place all their adult lives.

They have stomachs and mouths and even





skeletons! These skeletons can be on the

inside or outside of the coral animals and



**122**



are also called coral. When the coral animal dies, its skeleton remains in

place and other coral animals will come and live on top of the old skeletons.

The colony in which the coral lives is called a coral reef. ~~_So a coral reef has_~~

~~_both coral animals and the skeletons of those animals._~~


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


**Show Image 8A-7: Rattenborough**
**scuba diving**

I’m here in the Pacific Ocean at a coral reef.

In addition to the coral, there are many other

kinds of animals around a reef! I have found

everything from fish and shellfish, to octopi

and sharks, to snails and turtles. ~~Octopi~~ ~~_is_~~

~~_the plural of_~~ ~~octopus~~ ~~_—one octopus, but_~~

~~_many octopi._~~


**Show Image 8A-8: Starfish**

Here is an animal that lies in and around

this coral reef and whose name most of you

can probably guess based on its shape. It’s

a starfish! This starfish, also known as a sea

star, has five arms, which make it look like a

star. Although it is called a starfish, it’s not

actually a fish. It belongs to a group of animals



that have a spiny skin all over their bodies. If I touch the starfish, I can feel

that its body is covered with tiny, hard bumps that help protect it from

predators, such as sharks, manta rays, and other fish. ~~_What is a predator?_~~ ~~(an~~

~~animal that eats other animals)~~ Starfish are also able to protect themselves

in another amazing way: if another animal actually catches and bites off

one of the starfish’s arms, the starfish will not die, and it can still escape! In

time, a new arm will grow back to replace the missing arm! When an animal

regrows a missing body part, it’s called **regeneration** .


**Show Image 8A-9: Starfish on ocean floor**

The starfish doesn’t swim. It crawls very slowly

along the ocean floor using hundreds of tiny

tube feet. These feet attach to whatever the

starfish is crawling over. As it crawls along the

floor, the starfish is always on the lookout for





food. This starfish’s prey includes fish, snails,

clams, oysters, and crabs.



Lesson 8 Animals of the Saltwater Habitat
**123**


Challenge


Ask students to explain
why lobsters’ hard shell
stops most other animals
from trying to eat them.


**124**





**Show Image 8A-10: Lobster**

Here is another animal that lives in salt water.

This shellfish is called a lobster. Lobsters live

on the ocean floor in openings between rocks.

Their hard shell stops most other animals from

trying to eat them. Lobsters have many legs

that they use for crawling about, and they use

antennae on their head to feel their way along



the murky ocean floor. I have to watch out for that lobster’s claws! They are

called pincers, and they are very strong! The lobster uses them to defend

itself against its prey, and to catch and crush its own food.


Lobsters are carnivores; they eat fish, worms, and other shellfish. I’m going

to move out of the way of this lobster before I get squeezed!


**Show Image 8A-11: Hammerhead shark**

Looks like I moved right into the path of

another predator. This is a hammerhead

shark. If you take a look, you can see how the

hammerhead got its name. Its head is very

thick, and it looks like a hammer from above,





with an eye and a nostril on each end.

The hammerhead shark is a large fish, growing



up to twenty feet long and weighing over five hundred pounds. That’s about

the same weight as ten first graders! Hammerheads like to live in warm

waters, so they are mostly found near the coast where the waters are

shallow and warmer.


**Show Image 8A-12: Shark swimming**
**near reef**

Sharks are carnivores. The hammerhead’s

favorite food is a fish called a ray, but it also

likes to eat octopus, lobster, crab, and fish,

including other sharks. Most sharks have





smooth and slender bodies, which help them

to swim fast. Their mouths are full of sharp

teeth to help them catch their prey.


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


Support


Remind students of the
other animals they have
learned about that have
blubber: walruses, seals,
and polar bears.





**Show Image 8A-13: Blue whale**

Let’s go back up to the surface. There’s a sea

animal I’m sure you’ll want to see, but we

have to travel farther out to sea away from the

coral reef and into deeper water to see it. This

amazing creature is the biggest animal in the

world. It’s a blue whale! Blue whales have blue
gray skin and are covered in a layer of blubber



that helps keep them warm in the frigid ocean depths. ~~_What is blubber?_~~

~~(Blubber is a layer of fat that some animals have under their skin that keeps~~

~~them warm.)~~ Blue whales are so big that they can weigh as much as twenty
five elephants! In fact, blue whales are the biggest animals known to have

lived on earth—even bigger than dinosaurs!


**Show Image 8A-14: Blue whale blowhole**

The blue whale spends all its time living in

deep water, but unlike fish, it can’t breathe

underwater because it does not have gills.

It needs to breathe air just like we do.

The blue whale can hold its breath and stay





under the water for as long as thirty minutes

before eventually coming up for air. It breathes



using blowholes on the top of its head. Sometimes, when it does come up for

air, it breathes out a huge fountain of water from the blowholes.


Blue whales are carnivores. They eat lots of food to build up their blubber

during the summer months when food is easy to find. Blue whales eat teeny,

tiny sea creatures called **plankton** . The plankton that blue whales eat are

small shrimp-like shellfish that are about the size of your little finger. It’s

incredible to think that the biggest animal on Earth eats one of the smallest

animals on Earth.


The ocean is so huge and deep that we could spend all year looking at the

plants and animals that live there and still not see them all. In fact, there are

still many living things in the ocean that people—and adventurous rats—have

not even discovered yet. I hope you’ve enjoyed learning about the animals

in this saltwater habitat in the Pacific Ocean. We still have one more stop to

make on our worldwide tour of habitats. I’ll see you next time!

~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


Check for Understanding


**Compare/Contrast:** How is a saltwater habitat different from
a freshwater habitat? _(The water in a saltwater habitat contains_
_salt, which is not suitable for people or animals to drink; saltwater_
_habitats are in oceans, which are very large bodies of water,_
_whereas freshwater habitats are in much smaller bodies of_
_water like ponds, lakes, and rivers.)_


1. **Inferential.** How would you describe the ocean floor? Is it flat and level, or
does it go up and down? _(It goes up and down, or slopes, just like land outside_
_of the oceans; it has mountains and valleys._ )


2. **Inferential.** Describe the types of animals that live in this saltwater habitat
called the Pacific Ocean. _(starfish: shaped like a star; hammerhead shark:_
_head shaped like a hammer; lobster: lives on the ocean floor; etc.)_ Do the
animals that you learned about that live in the Arctic Ocean—walruses and
polar bears—also live in the Pacific Ocean? _(no)_ Why not? _(The climate and_
_other conditions are different.)_


3. **Inferential.** What are some of the ways that animals have adapted to
the Pacific Ocean saltwater habitat? _(large mouths and sharp teeth to catch_
_prey; feelers to find food in the dark; special chemicals in their bodies to make_
_light; etc.)_


**Show Image 8A-9: Starfish on ocean floor**


4. **Literal.** What animal is this? _(starfish)_ Starfish eat fish, snails, clams,
oysters, and crabs. Is the starfish a carnivore, omnivore, or herbivore?
_(carnivore)_ You heard about starfish and regeneration. What does
regeneration mean? _(It can regrow parts of its body.)_


5. **Evaluative.** How is the Pacific Ocean saltwater habitat similar to the
Arctic Ocean saltwater habitat? _(They are both saltwater habitats.)_ How
are the two saltwater habitats different? _(The Arctic Ocean is too cold_
_for many creatures to live in for very long and is covered with a lot of ice_
_whereas the Pacific Ocean has many animals; the floor of the Pacific Ocean_
_is in total darkness so animals have adapted to living there.)_


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


~~**WORD WORK: SHALLOW (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud today you heard, “The conditions under the water are
very different in various places. Some parts are deep, and some are shallow;
there are cool parts, and there are warm parts; some are dark, and some are
full of light.”


2. Say the word _shallow_ with me.


3. If something is shallow, it is not deep.


4. The water in the mud puddle is shallow.


5. Can you think of places where you have seen shallow water? Try to use the
word shallow when you talk about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary
guide and/or rephrase students’ answers, “The water in the is
shallow.”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use an Antonyms activity for follow-up.** The opposite, or antonym, of
_shallow_ is _deep_ . Listen to the following examples. If I describe something
that is shallow, say “That is shallow.” If I describe something that is deep,
say “That is deep.”


    - a cup of water _(That is shallow.)_


    - measuring down to the bottom of the ocean _(That is deep.)_


    - a baby pool _(That is shallow.)_


    - a bathtub _(That is shallow.)_


    - digging down to the inner core of the earth _(That is deep.)_

Rattenborough here, delivering the final

installment of our exciting habitats adventure.

We have traveled all around the world, looking at

some of the different habitats where plants and





animals live. A lot of those habitats, such as the

Arctic and the Sonoran Desert, have climates in



which you and I would have a tough time living because we are not adapted to them.

~~_Remember that_~~ ~~climate~~ ~~_means the type of weather a place has over a long period of_~~

~~_time. How would you have a tough time living in the Arctic? In the desert? As we’ve_~~

~~_seen, however, there are different living things in each habitat we have visited._~~


Because some living things are so well adapted to the specific conditions of their

specific habitats, any large change in their surroundings could make it hard for them

to survive. Just think what would happen if it got even a little colder in the desert: some

of those animals who are so good at keeping cool wouldn’t know how to stay warm. Or

what if it stopped raining in the rainforest? What would happen to all of those plants

that need lots of water? Or what if something happened to disrupt the food chain of a

certain animal? If that animal relied on a certain type of plant or animal to eat, and that

food source was taken out of the habitat, that animal would no longer have food it needs

to survive. However, the strongest living things have a better chance of survival if there

is a change in their surroundings. This is a normal part of life that allows the strongest

species to carry on. Species that are not as strong may become extinct, or die out.


Sometimes habitats change because the temperature or the weather changes,

but unfortunately, people often affect habitats as well. Whether they realize it or

not, people can make it very difficult for plants and animals to survive.


**Show Image 9A-2: Hurt habitats**

While most people are aware of the need to respect

the earth and treat it with care, there are still some

people whose actions are harmful. From cutting down

trees or starting forest fires, to dumping dangerous

waste and chemicals into our rivers—some people’s

actions can **endanger** lots of species of plants and

animals ~~.~~ ~~_To endanger plants and animals means to put_~~

~~_them in a dangerous situation. So, people’s actions can harm lots of plants and animals._~~


Unfortunately, some people behave carelessly. Sometimes, these people’s actions

**destroy** entire habitats. ~~_To_~~ ~~destroy~~ ~~_something means to injure or cause damage so_~~

~~_that it is no longer the same._~~ For example, someone walking in a forest might light

a match and drop it, and then the whole forest might burn. ~~_Here the word_~~ ~~match~~

~~_means a thin piece of wood with a special tip that produces a fire._~~ Even if they

were not harmed by the fire itself, many animals that used to live in trees would

no longer have a place to live. When they lose their homes, animals find it much

harder to continue to live in a particular habitat. Sometimes animals struggle to

find new places to live. After a while, there will be fewer and fewer of these kinds

of animals alive in the wild. When that happens, we say they have become an

**endangered species** ~~.~~ ~~_A_~~ ~~species~~ ~~_is a group of similar organisms, or living things,_~~

~~_that can produce offspring. So an endangered species is a group of living things_~~

~~_that could die out completely._~~ We say these species are endangered for a very

good reason: they are in danger of **extinction** . ~~Extinction~~ ~~_means the end of a_~~

~~_species because all its members have died._~~ An animal or plant that is extinct has

died out and does not exist anywhere in the world anymore.


Check for Understanding


**Recall:** What did you learn about in _The History of the Earth_ that
are extinct? _(dinosaurs)_


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


**Show Image 9A-3: Bald eagle in tree**

I’m on a mission to tell you about one animal

that can teach us a lot about endangered

species and how to save them. I have come

here to Washington State, in the northwestern

part of the United States, to show you an

amazing bird called a bald eagle. ~~_[Point to_~~

~~_Washington state on a U.S. map.]_~~ Look up



at that tree there, and you will see one of these eagles perched on the

very top branch. You may recognize the bald eagle because it is one of the

national symbols of our country. Drawings of the eagle appear as a symbol

on American money and in many other places. Believe it or not, the bald

eagle was almost extinct in the United States several years ago! If that had

happened, there would be no bald eagles still living. So, we’re grateful to be

able to spot this bald eagle today.


**Show Image 9A-4: Bald eagle in flight**

Bald eagles are scavengers, but they also eat

rats and other small animals, so I’d better stay

out of the way. ~~_What is a scavenger?_~~ ~~(an animal~~

~~that eats dead plants or dead animals)~~ I think

that the bald eagle looks very grand, don’t





you? ~~_This statement means the bald eagle_~~

~~_looks impressive or is admired because of its_~~



~~_size and importance._~~ It is covered with dark brown feathers, and its head and

tail are both white. Bald eagles are some of the largest birds living in this

country. They can grow up to three feet tall, which is almost as tall as a first

grader! Wow—this one has just taken off into the air, and you can see that it

has huge wings. In fact, their wings can spread to about eight feet in length.

While this eagle is flying around, let me tell you more about these special

birds.


**Show Image 9A-5: Housing development**

There used to be thousands of bald eagles in

the United States. But farmers started to hunt

them because they thought the eagles were

killing their farm animals. Eventually, people

started to cut down the trees in which the





eagles built their nests to make way for roads,

houses, and shopping malls.



Lesson 9 Habitat Destruction and Endangered Species
**137**


~~_Do you think it caused problems when people cut down trees that the eagles_~~

~~_used to build their nests in? Why or why not?_~~ With fewer places for them to

make their homes, eagles found it harder and harder to survive, and they

started to die out. Soon, there weren’t very many bald eagles left in the whole

United States. People started to notice that there were fewer and fewer bald

eagles, and they decided to find out why.


Check for Understanding


**Offering Opinions:** Why do you think the eagles were dying
out? _(Answers may vary, but should include the idea that there_
_weren’t many places for bald eagles to make their homes so_
_they couldn’t survive.)_


Scientists began to study the eagles, and they discovered two things.

~~_When scientists discover things, they learn new information._~~ The first was

that a lot of eagles didn’t have enough room to build their nests. Eagles do

not like to live in the same area as other eagles, so they build their nests far

away from each other. They like places that are very peaceful, and they need

huge, strong trees that can hold nests big enough for the adults and their

babies to live.


The scientists discovered that the eagles didn’t have enough room in the

areas where they had been living because people were chopping down trees

in order to build more roads and buildings. People were destroying the bald

eagles’ habitat.


**Show Image 9A-6: Farmers spraying pesticide**

The other thing that scientists found out was

that something bad was getting into the bald

eagles’ food supply. Farmers sometimes use

chemicals to keep bugs from eating their

crops. One chemical, though, made the eggs





that the eagles laid much thinner and easier to

break. Because of this, many eagle eggs were



**138**



breaking before they could hatch. No one knew before then, not even the

farmers, that the chemical was hurting the eagles, but it was.


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


**Show Image 9A-7: Bald eagle eggs**

Luckily, the scientists found out which

chemical was harming the eagles’ eggs.

Using the scientists’ information, the

United States government made laws to

protect the bald eagle and its habitat so

that the eagles’ food no longer contained

the harmful chemical. Thanks to these laws,



more eagles were born, and the numbers of eagles started to rise again. But,

banning these chemicals can have effects on farmers, who use the chemicals

to keep their crops safe from pests. The farmers then have to find other ways

to reduce pests in their crops. Some of these ways may not work as well and

can sometimes be more expensive.


~~_What two things were hurting bald eagles?_~~ Now, bald eagles have made an

amazing comeback ~~_or are once again a thriving species_~~, but people must

always be careful to protect their habitat. However, protecting a species’

habitat can come at a cost. Making laws to protect habitats can be expensive

and have consequences. These consequences may include people being

unable to build in certain locations and having to change plans and laws to

build in other places.


**Show Image 9A-8: Bald eagle nest**

This bald eagle has returned to its nest up in

that tree. Maybe it has some chicks up there

that it needs to feed, or maybe it’s just trying

to keep warm. It is pretty chilly!





And speaking of returning to the nest, I’m

afraid it’s time for me to go home now. I’ve



really enjoyed our trip around the world’s habitats, and I hope that you have,

too! Mrs. Rattenborough and my kids miss me, and to tell the truth, it’s been

a dangerous expedition for me. I’ll be glad to get out of danger and into the

safety of my lovely home under the steps. Home, sweet home—or maybe I

should say, “Habitat, sweet habitat!”

**Grade 1 | Unit 6**
##### Unit Assessment


This unit assessment evaluates each student’s retention of unit and
academic vocabulary words and the core content targeted in _Animals_
_and Habitats: The World We Share_ . The results should guide review and
remediation the following day.


There are two parts to this assessment. You may choose to do the parts
in more than one sitting if you feel this is more appropriate for your
students. Part I (vocabulary assessment) is divided into two sections: the
first assesses unit-related vocabulary, and the second assesses academic
vocabulary. Part II of the assessment address the core content targeted in
_Animals and Habitats: The World We Share_ .


~~**PART I**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.7.F**~~


**Directions:** I am going to ask a question using a word you have heard in the
Read-Alouds and the unit. First I will say the word and then ask a question
about it. If the answer to the question is _yes_, circle the thumbs-up. If the
answer to the question is _no_, circle the thumbs-down. I will ask each question
two times.

##### Culminating Activities


~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


Please use these final two days to address class results of the Unit
Assessment. We suggest you begin with the whole-class Read-Aloud activity
to reinforce unit content. Based on the results of the Unit Assessment and
students’ formative assessments, you may wish to use the remaining time to
provide remediation opportunities that target specific areas of weakness for
individual students, small groups, or the whole class.


Alternatively, you may also choose to use this class time to extend or enrich
students’ experience with unit knowledge. A number of enrichment activities
are provided in order to provide students with opportunities to enliven their
experiences with unit concepts.


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share


~~**REMEDIATION**~~


You may choose to regroup students according to particular area of
weakness, as indicated from Unit Assessment results.


Remediation opportunities include:


  - targeting Review Activities


  - revisiting lesson Applications


  - rereading and discussing select Read-Alouds


  - using the corresponding activities in the Language Studio


~~**ENRICHMENT**~~


**Fresh Water vs. Salt Water**


Materials: Clear container; water from a pond or other freshwater
environment; salt; drinking water; two small drinking cups per student


**Note** : Do not allow students to drink the water from a pond or other
freshwater environment you have brought in. Instead, have them drink the
drinking water.


  - Bring to class a clear container of water scooped from a pond, or other water
that has been sitting outdoors in the open for at least two weeks.


  - Use magnifying glasses, microscopes, or an overhead projector to allow
students to observe some aquatic organisms.


  - Then, mix a half-teaspoon of salt with one cup of water to simulate the
salinity of ocean water.


  - Pour a small amount of salt water into a drinking cup for a few students.


  - Pour drinking water into the other drinking cup for each student.


  - Consistent with your school’s policies, have students dip a finger in the salt
water and taste the water on their finger. Also have them take a small sip of
the drinking water.


  - Have them describe the difference in taste between salt water and
fresh water.


Culminating Activities
**151**


Image Cards 1–26




 - Explain that drinking large amounts of salt water is dangerous to the
human body.


**Oceans: Both Fun and Useful**


Materials: World map

 - Have students identify the oceans on a world map.


 - Have them brainstorm ways that we use the ocean for fun and how we use it
to help us get work done.


**Ocean Habitat Mural**


Materials: Long piece of blue paper; ocean pictures; scissors; drawing
materials; glue or tape

 - Have students make an ocean habitat mural using resources available in
the classroom, such as ocean pictures from magazines, paints, and other
art supplies.


 - Using a long piece of blue paper, students may draw, paint, or color their part
of the ocean to create a class mural. Instruct students to write or dictate a
sentence under their section describing their part of the ocean.


 - After it is finished, post the mural on the wall and have students act as
docents to explain the ocean picture.


 - Share this picture with other Grade 1 classrooms or with other classes in
the school.


 - Extend this activity by drawing other habitats and placing pictures of animals
in the correct habitat.


**Habitat Destruction**


Materials: paper, writing tools

 - As a writing activity, ask students to think about what happens when a
habitat is destroyed.


 - Also, have students think about what they can do to help protect the
environment and the habitat of animals. You may wish to review the idea
webs students created in Lesson 9 to give students a concrete example.


**Idea Webs**


Materials: Habitat Posters 1–7, Image Cards 1–26, paper, writing tools

 - Review the habitats studied using the Habitat Posters and Image Cards.


 - Have students work in pairs, small groups, or independently to create idea
webs for individual habitats.


Unit 6 Animals and Habitats: The World We Share



**152**


 - Additionally, you may wish to have students work together as a whole class
to create a large idea web for habitats in general.


**Venn Diagrams**


Materials: Habitat Posters 1–7, Image Cards 1–26, Venn diagrams,
writing tools

 - Have students select two habitats to identify similarities and differences
between using a 2-circle Venn diagram.


 - You may wish to have students review their Habitat Journals,
the Habitat Posters, and Image Cards to help them gather information.


 - You may wish to have students work in pairs or small groups to complete
the Venn diagram.


**Food Chain**


Materials: Image Cards 12–26, paper, drawing tools

 - Divide students into four groups, one for each of the following habitats:
forest, rainforest, freshwater habitat, saltwater habitat.


 - Give students the Image Cards associated with their assigned habitat.


 - Have students use the Image Cards to create a food chain (or more than
one, if it exists) within that habitat. Students may find some food sources
are missing from Image Cards. Students should create cards for those food
sources to complete the food chain.


 - Have each group present their food chain(s) to the class. Have students
explain the pieces they added, as needed.


 - After each group presents, remove one of the cards and discuss what they
think will happen to the other plant(s) and animal(s) in the food chain.
_(Answers will vary, and may include that living things will all be impacted_
_because if one living thing loses a food source it can’t survive, meaning it can’t_
_serve as a food source for another living thing.)_


 - You may wish to use the follow to promote a discussion:


   - Will all of them die, or could they find another source of food?


   - What else do could those animals could eat? For example, if the zebra is
removed, what else do they think the lion could eat?


   - What happens if there are no replacements? Can the animals survive
without anything to eat?



Image Cards 1–26


Image Cards 12–26



Culminating Activities
**153**

**Habitat Journal**


Materials: Habitat Journal, drawing and writing tools

 - Review all journal entries by having students read their sentences about each
habitat and describe their drawings.


 - Have students add additional sentences about the last four habitats and add
more details to their drawings.


 - With a partner or in small groups, have students create sentences describing
why each habitat is unique.

**Eletelephony**
Laura Elizabeth Richards


Once there was an elephant,


Who tried to use the telephant—


No! No! I mean an elephone


Who tried to use the telephone—


(Dear me! I am not certain quite


That even now I’ve got it right.)


Howe’er it was, he got his trunk


Entangled in the telephunk;


The more he tried to get it free,


The louder buzzed the telephee—


(I fear I’d better drop the song


Of elephop and telephong!)
