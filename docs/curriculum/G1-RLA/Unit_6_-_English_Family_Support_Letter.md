# **Welcome!**
#### **Grade 1, Unit 6**
## **Animals and Habitats:** **The World We Share**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will explore how connected living things are to the environment they
live in.

### **What’s the story?**

Students will learn about the concept of **habitats**, the different **plants** and **animals** that
are a part of specific habitats, and what makes each habitat **unique** .

### **What will my student learn?**

Students will learn about **habitats** and how plants and animals develop characteristics
that help them **adapt** and **survive** in particular climates. Students will also learn about
the **types of foods** animals eat and will be introduced to the notion of a **food** **chain** .


Students will **identify and describe** different habitats based on their **unique**
**characteristics** . They will learn to **classify** animals according to the types of food they
eat. Students will also explore **informational writing** . They will keep a habitat journal,
creating a new entry for every habitat they learn about.

### **Conversation starters**


Ask your student questions about the unit to promote discussion and continued learning:

1. What is a habitat?

**Follow up:** Describe the habitat that surrounds where we live. Is it a good habitat
for plants and animals? Why?

2. Tell me about the Arctic tundra.

**Follow up:** What animals live there? What kinds of plants grow there? How have
the animals that live there adapted to keep themselves warm?

3. What are some animals that you have been learning about?

**Follow up:** What habitat do those animals live in? How have they adapted to
their environment? Why is it important for living creatures to adapt to their
environment?

4. Let’s compare some of the habitats you have been learning about. (Choose from
tundra, savanna, desert, forest, rainforest, etc.)
**Follow up:** How are they similar to one another? How are they different? Which
habitat would you want to live in? Why?
