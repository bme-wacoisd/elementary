## **American Independence**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will begin to understand and recall the story behind the birth of the United
States.

### **What’s the story?**

Students will be introduced to important **historical figures and events** instrumental in the
thirteen colonies gaining their **independence from Britain** to become the **United States of**
**America** .

### **What will my student learn?**

Students will learn about the **Boston Tea Party**, the **Declaration of Independence**, and the
founding of a **new nation** . They will also explore important historical figures, such as **Betsy Ross**,
**George Washington**, **Benjamin Franklin**, and **Thomas Jefferson**, and they will explore the
motivation of the colonists, including ideas of “no taxation without representation” and religious
liberty. They will study the chronology of events, the roles these figures played, and how they all fit
together.


Students will explore the genre of **informational writing** by learning to **identify** important **facts**
**and information** before, during, and after the daily Read-Alouds. They will **plan and write** their
own informational paragraphs about the founding of the United States. They will also work as a

you think the colonists felt when they heard the Declaration of Independence?

If you could design a flag for our family, what would you include? Why?

him? What questions would you ask him?
