##### **Unit 10** Adventure Stories:

Tales from the Edges of the World

**Activity Book**


This Activity Book contains activity pages that accompany many of the lessons from
the Teacher Guide for Unit 10. The activity pages are organized and numbered according to
the lesson number and the order in which they are used within the lesson. For example, if
there are two activity pages for Lesson 4, the first will be numbered 4.1 and the second 4.2.
The activity pages in this book do not always include written instructions for students because
the instructions would have words that are not decodable. Teachers will explain these activity
pages to the students orally, using the instructions in the Teacher Guide. The Activity Book is a
student component, which means each student should have an Activity Book.

**DATE:**


Dear Family Member,


Today, your student was introduced to a new unit of study: _Adventure Stories: Tales_
_from the Edges of the World!_ In this unit, students will listen to Read-Alouds and trade
books that will increase their vocabulary and reading comprehension skills, learn valuable
lessons about perseverance and teamwork, and become familiar with gathering research
information and writing about what they have learned. On the last day of the unit, students
will host an Adventure Gallery Walk, where they will take on the persona of an adventurer
they admired from the unit and share what they have learned. Below are some suggestions
for activities you may do at home to continue your student’s enjoyment of the adventure
stories.


1. Character, Setting, Plot, and Conflict


Encourage your student to tell you about the story _Mae Among the Stars_ by Roda
Ahmed. Ask your student to include such details as the characters, setting, and plot,
including the barriers Mae Jemison faced and how she persevered. Talk with your student
about barriers you, or someone you know, have overcome and how you did so.


2. Comparing and Contrasting


Students used a Venn diagram to compare and contrast _Tomas and the Galápagos_
_Adventure_ by Carolyn Lunn and _Mae Among the Stars_ by Roda Ahmed. Ask them to recall
the comparisons and contrasts between the two stories. To further their understanding
of the skill, choose two objects in your home and ask your student how they are similar or
different, or compare and contrast two stories that you might have read together.


3. Read Aloud Each Day


Set aside time to read to your student every day. Be sure to talk about the characters,
setting, and plot of stories. You may also want to reread a story that has been read at
school. Check your local library for the books read in class.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they have
been learning at school.

Dear Family Member,


#### 6.1 Activity Page



Students are working hard on their research as they reach the midpoint of the
_Adventure Stories: Tales from the Edges of the World_ unit. As the day of the Adventure
Gallery Walk draws closer, students may ask you to listen to their presentations and
maybe even borrow a tie or hat if they choose to dress up as their favorite adventurer from
the unit! Students will hear stories about adventures under the ocean and in cold and
snowy places, such as the North Pole and Mount Everest, in the second half of the unit.
Below are some suggestions for activities you may do at home to continue your student’s
enjoyment of the adventure stories.


1. _Keep On! The Story of Matthew Henson, Co-Discoverer of the North Pole_ by
Deborah Hopkinson


Ask your student to tell you about Matthew Henson’s journey to the North Pole and the
team he relied upon to get there. Talk to your student about what you feel makes a team
valuable and ask them their thoughts. Tell your student about a time you were on a team or
about a team you follow, and what that team accomplished.


2. Saying and Phrases: “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.”


Your student will talk about this saying and its meaning at school in relation to Sophia
Danenberg, the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest without a guide. Talk
with your student about the meaning of the phrase and situations where you can use this
saying. Tell them about a time you had to try something many times before you could
master it. Ask them about a time they had to do the same.


3. Giving a Presentation


The day of the Adventure Gallery Walk is just a few days away, and your student will
soon be sharing what they have learned during their research. They will be discussing good
presentation habits in class. Ask your student what those habits are and encourage them
to practice their presentation at home, so they are confident on the big day.


4. Read Aloud Each Day


Set aside time to read to your student every day. Be sure to talk about the characters,
setting, and plot of stories. You may also want to reread a story that has been read at
school. Check your local library for the books read in class.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they have
been learning at school.
