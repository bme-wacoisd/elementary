Dear Family Member,


## 1.2 Take-Home



During the next several days, your student will be learning about the events that led
to the birth of the United States of America. Your student will learn about the thirteen
original colonies, the Boston Tea Party, the “shot heard round the world,” the Declaration
of Independence, and the legend of Betsy Ross. Following are some suggestions for
activities that you may do at home to reinforce what your student is learning about this
period of American history.


1. Where Are We?


On a U.S. map, have your student locate the thirteen original colonies in America.
Share with each other any knowledge that you have of this area. (If you do not have
a map, you may check one out from the library.)


2. Draw and Write


Have your student draw and/or write about what they have learned about these events
and then share their drawing and/or writing with you. Ask questions to keep your student
using the vocabulary learned at school.


3. If You Had Been There


With your student, imagine what it would have been like to have been at one of the
following events: Paul Revere’s ride, signing of the Declaration of Independence, or sewing
of the flag. Talk about what you would have seen and heard and how you would have felt.


4. Sayings and Phrases: “Let the Cat Out of the Bag”


Your student will be learning the saying “let the cat out of the bag.” Talk with your
student about the meaning of this saying and when it may or may not be appropriate to
reveal a secret.


5. Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read to your student each day. The local library has many
books on the history of the United States as a new nation.

Dear Family Member,


## 7.1 Take-Home



I hope your student has enjoyed learning about some of the important events that led
to the birth of the United States. Over the next several days, your student will learn more
about some of the key people who played significant roles during those events. Following
are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to reinforce what your
student is learning about George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson.


1. Money Detective: Search for the Founding Fathers


Look on coins and paper bills with your student to find images of the people they
have been learning about. George Washington’s face is on the one-dollar bill and on some
quarters. Thomas Jefferson is on some nickels, with his home, Monticello, appearing on
the reverse. Jefferson is also pictured on the two-dollar bill, with a picture of the signing of
the Declaration of Independence on the opposite side. Benjamin Franklin appears on the
one-hundred dollar bill!


2. Draw and Write


Have your student draw and/or write about what has been learned about the people
and events leading up to the birth of our nation and then share the drawing with you.
Ask questions to keep your student using the vocabulary learned at school.


3. Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read to your student each day.


4. Sayings and Phrases: “There’s No Place Like Home” and “Never Leave Until
Tomorrow What You Can Do Today”


Your student will learn two common sayings, “there’s no place like home” and
“never leave until tomorrow what you can do today.” Talk to your student about the
meaning of these sayings and try to use them in everyday speech.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they
have learned at school.
