Dear Family Member,


## 1.1 Take-Home



During the next several days, your student will be learning about the the different
types of rocks on earth. Your student will learn about the earth’s surface and the layers
of the earth (crust, mantle, and core), as well as volcanoes and geysers. Following are
some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to reinforce what your student is
learning about this science topic.


1. The Earth’s Surface


Use a globe or map to help your student locate and identify the earth’s continents and
oceans. Also locate the North Pole, the South Pole, and the equator. Share with each other
any knowledge that you have of these.


2. Make a Model


Make a model of the earth’s layers or a volcano.


3. Draw and Write


Have your student draw and/or write about what has been learned about the layers of
the earth, volcanoes, or geysers, and then share the drawing with you. Ask questions to
keep your student using the vocabulary learned at school.


4. If You Were There


With your student, imagine what it would be like to witness a volcanic eruption. Talk
about what you would see and hear and how you would feel.


5. Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read to your student each day. The local library has many
books on geology.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they have
been learning about at school.

Dear Family Member,


## 5.2 Take-Home



I hope you and your student have been enjoying talking about different type of rocks
on planet Earth. Today, your student learned about minerals and how they are useful to
people. Soon, your student will learn that all rocks can be sorted into three groups: igneous,
sedimentary, and metamorphic. Your student will also learn about fossils and what they tell us
about life on the earth many years ago. Below are some suggestions for activities you may do
at home to reinforce what your student is learning about this science topic.


1. Rock Descriptions


If possible, have your student view some rocks from nature and talk about their
characteristics. If you do not have access to real rocks, look for pictures of rocks that can
be described.


2. Draw and Write


Have your student draw and/or write about what has been learned about minerals,
layers of the earth, a volcano, or a geyser and then share the drawing with you. Ask
questions to keep your student using the vocabulary learned at school.


3. If You Were There


With your student, imagine what it would be like to discover a fossil. Talk about what
you would see and hear and how you would feel.


4. Minerals


Talk about the ways that minerals such as coal or salt are important to you or other
people.


5. Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read to your student each day. You can find books related
to this unit at your local library.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they have
been learning about at school.
