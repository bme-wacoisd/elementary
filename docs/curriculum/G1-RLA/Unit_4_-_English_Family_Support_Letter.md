Dear Family Member,

Students will learn about the planet they live on, **Earth**, and how the **sun, stars, moon**, and **other**
**planets** relate to it.
### **What will my student learn?**

Students will explore the **sun** and learn about the basics of **astronomy** . They will also have the
opportunity to learn about the history of **space exploration** as they read about **NASA** and the
**missions to the moon** .

Students will have many chances to **write** . They will focus on **informational** **writing** by collecting

Ask your student questions about the unit to promote discussion and continued learning:
