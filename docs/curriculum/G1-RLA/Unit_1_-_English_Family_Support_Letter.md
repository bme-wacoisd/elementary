# **Welcome!**
#### **Grade 1, Unit 1**
## **Sharing Stories**

Dear Family Member,
In this unit, students will be introduced to stories that have been loved for generations, and that

all feature a moral.

### **What’s the story?**

Students will be introduced to classic Aesop's **fables**, such as "The Boy Who Cried Wolf," and
"The Goose and the Golden Eggs." They will hear two classic **folktales**, including "Peter Rabbit."
And they will also listen to classic **parables**, including "The Prodigal Son." These stories provide
an opportunity for students to develop a strong foundation in common cultural references that
they will find in literature as they advance through school.

### **What will my student learn?**

Students will continue to **increase their vocabulary** and **reading comprehension skills** . They
will become familiar with **key elements** and **parts** of a story as they **explore valuable lessons**
that are taught through the morals of the stories.


Throughout the unit, students will **explore narrative writing** by identifying elements in the
stories they hear and by working with their peers to **plan** and **draft some narrative**
**writing** of their own.

### **Conversation starters**

Ask your student questions about the unit to promote discussion and continued learning:

1. What has been your favorite fable so far?

**Follow up:** I know that fables are meant to teach a moral, or a lesson. What was the
moral of that fable?

2. Where did the story you read today take place?

**Follow up:** How would you describe that setting?

3. What is the term used to describe when animals act like people in a story? ( _personification_ )

**Follow up:** Tell me about one of the stories you read where an animal acted like a person.

4. I know you have been learning about the word _disguise_ in this unit. Can you use that word
in a sentence for me? I will try to use it in a sentence too!
**Follow up:** Why was the wolf disguised as a sheep in “The Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing”?
