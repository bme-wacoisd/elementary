Dear Family Member,

**Take Home**



Today, your student has started learning about Daniel Boone, one of the first persons
to explore the land west of the Appalachian Mountains. Daniel Boone helped make the
Wilderness Road, which allowed other settlers to move west. During the next several days,
your student will continue to learn about the westward expansion of the United States
and specifically about the travels of Lewis and Clark. Below are some suggestions for
activities you may do at home to reinforce what your student is learning about this period
of American history.


1. Where Are We?


Have your student locate the Appalachian Mountains on a map. Share with each other
any knowledge that you have of this area. (If you do not have a map, check one out from
the library.)


2. Draw and Write


Have your student draw and/or write about what has been learned about Daniel
Boone and then share the drawing with you. Ask questions to keep your student using the
vocabulary learned at school, such as _barrier, claimed, settlements, woodsmen, passes,_
_pioneers, trailblazer,_ and _wilderness_ .


3. If You Were There


With your student, imagine what it would have been like to have been with Daniel
Boone when he crossed the Appalachian Mountains through the Cumberland Gap or
made the Wilderness Road. Talk about what you would have seen and heard and how you
would have felt.


4. Borrow a Book


Set aside time to read to your student each day. The local library has a variety of books
about this period of American history.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they have
been learning about at school.

Dear Family Member,


### 7.2



**Take Home**



Over the next several days, your student will learn more about the westward expansion
of the United States. Your student already learned about the Louisiana Purchase and will
continue learning about Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery. Your student will also
learn about Sacagawea, who helped the Corps as a guide.


1. If You Were There


With your student, imagine what it would have been like to have journeyed with the
Corps of Discovery as they traveled through new lands and discovered new plants and
animals. Talk about what you would have seen and heard and how you might have felt.


2. Draw and Write


Have your student draw and/or write about what has been learned about Lewis and
Clark and the Corps of Discovery, and then ask them to share the drawing with you. Ask
questions to keep your student using the vocabulary learned at school. You may wish to
have your student list the three tasks President Thomas Jefferson wanted the Lewis and
Clark expedition to accomplish (1. making friends with Native Americans; 2. collecting
samples of different plants and animals; 3. finding a water route all the way to the
Pacific Ocean).


3. Sacagawea and the Sacagawea Golden Dollar Coin


If possible, show your student a Sacagawea Golden Dollar Coin and point out
Sacagawea.


4. Borrow a Book


Set aside time to read to your student each day.
