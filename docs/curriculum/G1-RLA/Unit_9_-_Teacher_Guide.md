#### Introduction


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching the
_Heading West: Exploring the Frontier_ unit. The Teacher Guide for _Heading West: Exploring the Frontier_
contains eleven daily lessons, each of which is composed of two distinct parts, so that the lesson
may be divided into smaller chunks of time and presented at different intervals during the day. The
entire lesson will require a total of sixty minutes.


This unit includes a Pausing Point following Lesson 4. At the end of the unit, a Unit Review, a Unit
Assessment, and Culminating Activities are included to allow time to review, reinforce, assess, and
remediate content knowledge. You should spend no more than seventeen days total on this unit.

~~**WHY HEADING WEST IS IMPORTANT**~~


In this unit, students will learn about the American frontier, explorers, and events that played an
important role in the westward expansion of the United States.


The overriding focus of this unit is to emphasize the story of the westward expansion of the United
States. While students will hear about many people, events, and dates, it is important to recognize
that Grade 1 students are not expected to master or recall all of these details and facts. Some
specifics are, of course, necessary so that students can understand and retell the story of the
westward expansion of the United States. The details that Grade 1 students should be able to recall
are explicitly identified in the Core Content Objectives that follow. Other factual information is
incorporated to accurately tell and expose students to the complete “story.”


Students will first review the development of the thirteen colonies and the Revolutionary War. They
will hear how the first English colonists settled along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. As more people
migrated to the colonies, and by the time of the Revolutionary War, the line of the frontier moved
all the way to the Appalachian Mountains. Students will learn that the Appalachian Mountains were
difficult to traverse and acted as a barrier to colonists who wanted to settle farther west. Students
will be introduced to Daniel Boone and the role he played in westward expansion, specifically his role
in widening a network of Native American trails that became known as the Wilderness Road.


After hearing about Daniel Boone and the Wilderness Road, students will then hear about the
presidency of Thomas Jefferson. Students will learn about how Jefferson enabled the purchase
of the Louisiana Territory from France, moving the line of the frontier all the way to the Rocky
Mountains. Students will hear about Lewis and Clark’s explorations of the Louisiana Territory and
about the three reasons why President Jefferson commissioned the exploration of the new land—to
find an all-water route from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean; to make contact with various
Native American tribes; and to record the geography and the wildlife of the Louisiana Territory.
Students will also be introduced to Sacagawea and her role in the expedition. By the end of the unit,
students should have a good understanding of the concept of westward expansion, as well as the
key people involved, and how it contributed to the growth of the United States.


Understanding the chronology of events and people in the westward expansion of the United States
will lay the foundation for other historical topics, including coverage of 19th-century westward
expansion in later grades.


The text that students will be listening to provides opportunities for students to build content
knowledge and draw connections to social studies. You may build on class discussions to support
students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of History, Geography, and Culture
from the Social Studies TEKS. This content is not a replacement for grade-level science and social
studies instruction. For more information about the quantitative and qualitative measures used to
determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED DURING KINDERGARTEN**~~


The following units, and the specific core content that was targeted in those units, are particularly
relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _Heading West: Exploring the Frontier_ . This
background knowledge will greatly enhance your students’ understanding of the Read-Alouds they
are about to enjoy:


**Colonial and Native Americans (Kindergarten)**


**Kings and Queens (Kindergarten)**


**America: Our Great Country (Kindergarten)**


~~**CORE CONTENT OBJECTIVES ADDRESSED IN THIS UNIT**~~


Students will:


  - Locate the Appalachian Mountains on a map


  - Describe Daniel Boone and his experiences


  - Identify what the Wilderness Road refers to


  - Locate the Mississippi River on a map


  - Locate the Rocky Mountains on a map


  - Explain why Thomas Jefferson wanted to buy the city of New Orleans


  - Identify and locate the Louisiana Territory on a map


  - Explain the significance of the Louisiana Territory and the Louisiana Purchase

 - Explain why and how Sacagawea helped Lewis and Clark


~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR HEADING WEST: EXPLORING THE FRONTIER**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _Heading West: Exploring the Frontier_ in
the forms in which they appear in the Read-Alouds. Boldfaced words on the list have an associated
Word Work activity. The inclusion of the words on this list does not mean that students are
immediately expected to be able to use all of these words on their own. However, through repeated
exposure throughout the lessons, they should acquire a good understanding of most of these words
and begin to use some of them in conversation.

~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit, students will explore informational writing. Students will use a graphic organizer to
analyze the actions of the trailblazer Daniel Boone. Students will also write sentences about such
topics as: the Appalachian Mountains as a natural barrier to moving west; the Louisiana Purchase;
and the route they take to school. Students will also work together to write a short informational
paragraph summarizing Lewis and Clark’s expedition using information from a graphic organizer
they completed in various lessons.


The following activities may be added to students’ writing portfolios to showcase student writing
within and across units:


  - Appalachian Mountains (Lesson 1)


  - Somebody Wanted But So Then Chart (Lesson 2)


  - The Louisiana Purchase Puzzle (Lesson 4)


  - Map with Route (Lesson 5)


  - Three Tasks Chart (Lessons 7–10)


  - Summary of Lewis and Clark’s Expedition (Lesson 11)


  - any additional writing completed during the Pausing Point, Unit Review, or Culminating Activities


~~**FOUNDATIONAL ORAL LANGUAGE**~~


The Think-Pair-Share and Turn-and-Talk prompts throughout the unit provide opportunities to teach
and reinforce how to communicate by using conventions of language, speaking when recognized,
and making appropriate contributions to discussion.


  - You can also reinforce these ideas by modeling using an appropriate pace, recognizing students’
individual contributions to group discussions, and pointing out conventions of language.


  - Explain to students that when working in whole/small groups, group members share responsibility
for the work they do together. To work effectively and respectfully, everyone should recognize the
contributions made by each group member. For example, as group members discuss a text, each group
member can share thoughts and reactions. If preparing to return to a whole-group discussion, group
members can summarize the group’s ideas by including contributions from everyone in the group.


  - Consider using a discussion checklist that tracks student participation, as well as introducing
discussion techniques that enhance participation.


~~**TEKS 1.1.C; TEKS 1.1.D**~~


**TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using the conventions of language;
**TEKS 1.1.D** Work collaboratively with others by following agreed-upon rules for discussion, including listening to others, speaking when recognized, and making
appropriate contributions.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Introducing the Read-Aloud**

 - Prepare to divide students into four small groups.


 - Draw a line on the board or chart paper to serve as a timeline. You will add
Image Cards to the timeline in this and future lessons.


**Note to Teacher**


The intent of this first lesson is to review information that students have
previously learned in the program. This knowledge provides the foundation
for subsequent lessons in this unit. In the timeline activity, students are
asked to recall what they may have learned about Native Americans,
Columbus, and the Pilgrims. In this activity, it is not necessary to provide an
exhaustive review of each of these topics. Rather, the purpose is to orient
students to the topics that will be addressed in the Read-Aloud.


You will not use the timeline again until Lesson 3.


**Universal Access**

 - You may wish to gather images of tools used by Daniel Boone and animals he
hunted to share with students.

~~**TEKS 1.1.D**~~


~~**TIMELINE (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that for the next several days they will be learning about
how the United States grew in size and how this growth affected Native
Americans, settlers, and the landscape.


  - Identify the following Image Cards for students:


    - Image Card 1 (Native Americans)


    - Image Card 2 (Columbus)


    - Image Card 3 (Pilgrims)


    - Image Card 4 (Declaration of Independence)


  - Tell students they will work in small groups to discuss a particular Image
Card. Explain that each group will share information about the topic on
their Image Card with the whole class. Also explain that together, you will
determine how to arrange the Image Cards in sequential order to show the
order in which the topics occurred.


  - Divide students into four groups and give each group one Image Card and
have them discuss it.


  - When groups have finished discussing the Image Cards, have them present
their information to the class. Reference the following information to support
group presentations as needed:


    - Image Card 1 (Native Americans): In Kindergarten students learned about
Native Americans. Native Americans were the first people known to live in
North America.


    - Image Card 2 (Columbus): A European explorer named Columbus traveled
by ship to the continent of North America.

  - Image Card 3 (Pilgrims): After Columbus’s voyages, more and more
groups of people from various countries in Europe decided to make the
trip across the Atlantic Ocean to explore North America. One of these
groups was the Pilgrims who came from England and landed at Plymouth
Rock, along the east coast of North America.


  - Image Card 4 (Declaration of Independence): More and more people
came over from Europe after Columbus and formed colonies. Before the
United States became a country, there were thirteen colonies that were
ruled by the English king and government. These colonies displaced Native
Americans already living there and forced them to leave their homes
and move west. The thirteen colonies decided they wanted to declare
themselves a free and independent nation, and Thomas Jefferson was
asked to write the Declaration of Independence.


- When each group has presented, direct students’ attention to the timeline
you prepared in advance.


- Working together, support students in placing the Image Cards on the
timeline in sequential order. Use the following information as a guide:


  - Image Card 1 (Native Americans): place at the left end of the timeline
to help students remember that Native Americans were the first people
known to live in North America


  - Image Card 2 (Columbus): place to the right of the Native Americans
Image Card to show that Columbus came to North America after Native
Americans had been living there for many, many years


  - Image Card 3 (Pilgrims): place to the right of the Columbus Image Card to
show that the Pilgrims came to North America after Columbus


  - Image Card 4 (Declaration of Independence): leave a blank space after
Image Card 3 and place this Image Card to the right of the blank space to
show that the colonists declared independence from Great Britain, which
resulted in the Revolutionary War


- Review the Image Cards in order on the timeline.


- Explain that in today’s Read-Aloud, students will briefly review what they
have already learned about the early history of the United States and the
people who lived there.


- Tell them they will also hear about one of the first explorers of the American
West, Daniel Boone.

Today, people from all over the world live together in

communities from one end of the North American

continent to the other—from the Atlantic Ocean

in the east, to the Pacific Ocean in the west, and





everywhere in between. ~~_[Point to North America_~~

~~_as you talk about it, emphasizing that the Atlantic_~~



~~_Ocean is to the east and the Pacific Ocean is to the west.]_~~ This map of North America

shows the United States in green. You can see lots of thin white lines outlining the

states that make up our country, the United States of America. However, hundreds of

years ago the map of the United States was much smaller than it is today.


**Show Image 1A-2: Native Americans**

Long, long ago, the only people who lived on the

continent of North America were people now

known as Native Americans. Native Americans

have lived in North America for thousands of

years. Native Americans lived in both seasonal





and permanent villages. They used great

knowledge of the land and its resources to

create many villages and cultures.

**Show Image 1A-3: World map**

At the same time, far away on the other side

of the ocean, many other people had their

own towns and villages. These people lived on

the continent of Europe and were known as

Europeans. ~~_[Point to Europe as you talk about it.]_~~

About six hundred years ago, Europeans began

to leave their lands and sail to other parts of the



world, seeking spices, gold, and other riches. Some of these explorers arrived in

North America. ~~_[Point to North America again, and ask students if they can name_~~

~~_one of the first European explorers to visit North America.]_~~


**Show Image 1A-4: Europeans and**

**Native Americans**

Imagine how surprised Native Americans and

Europeans must have been to see each other:

people who looked, dressed, and spoke very

differently from themselves. ~~_Here, the word_~~





~~spoke~~ ~~_means talked._~~


The early explorers who came to North



America were mostly interested in finding goods and riches that they could

take back to Europe to sell. Many of these explorers learned vital skills from

Native Americans, who knew the land very well. ~~_Vital skills are skills that_~~

~~_are extremely important to someone’s survival._~~ Native Americans helped

Europeans with many tasks, including hunting, fishing, gathering, and

farming. In exchange for their help, Europeans brought things to trade with

Native Americans, such as cloth. For many years Europeans traveled back

and forth across the Atlantic Ocean. ~~_[Have students trace the paths of trading_~~

~~_ships across the Atlantic Ocean on the map or in the air with their fingers.]_~~


**Show Image 1A-5: Native Americans helping**

**settlers survive**

Some Europeans were content ~~_or satisfied_~~ to

just trade with Native Americans, but others

became interested in starting **settlements**

because they wanted to live on the continent

The word _spoke_ also
means one of the bars or
wires that connects the
center of a wheel to its
rim, like on a bicycle wheel
or wagon wheel. Please

Flip Book for additional
support on the multiple
meanings of _spoke_ .





as well. ~~_Settlements are places where people_~~

~~_make their homes in a new area._~~ The English



started two early settlements in North America in the 1600s—Plymouth, in

what is now Massachusetts, and Jamestown, in what is now Virginia. ~~_[Show_~~

~~_students the approximate locations of Plymouth and Jamestown on a U.S._~~

~~_map.]_~~ At Plymouth, Native Americans helped the settlers survive. Do you

remember how at Plymouth they celebrated their harvest together, the first

Thanksgiving in America? The Europeans would not have been able to grow

the corn and squash for that meal without help from Native Americans.


**Show Image 1A-6: English settlements and**

**Native American communities**

As time passed, more and more Europeans

came to live in North America. Fights between

Europeans and Native Americans over the land

arose. Eventually, settlers **claimed** most of





the land on the east coast of North America.

~~_The word_~~ ~~claimed~~ ~~_means that the settlers_~~



~~_said the land belonged to them._~~ The English formed colonies, or settlements

controlled by far-away England, from Massachusetts all the way to Georgia.

~~_[Help students locate the East Coast, from Massachusetts to Georgia, on a_~~

Eventually, some of the more adventuresome settlers wanted to explore land

to the west of them. One of these people was a young man by the name of

Daniel Boone.

sisters all helped their parents plow the fields

on the farm. But Daniel was never content in



**14**



the open fields. He was curious about life in the woods around their farm and

spent as much time as possible creating paths through the forest. He made

friends with young Native American boys who lived in the wooded areas.

They taught Daniel how to move silently through the forest and how to trap

wild animals and catch fish in the streams. Daniel learned how to use a knife

and tomahawk at an early age. His father, seeing how interested Daniel was

in hunting, taught Daniel how to use a special type of gun called a rifle. ~~_It_~~

~~_was common for people to learn hunting and survival skills during this time in_~~


Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


~~_history, which is very different from today. Today, most people have the option_~~

~~_to buy food and other things rather than hunt for these resources themselves._~~


One day, while helping his father plow the fields, Daniel asked if he could be

allowed to help out the family in another way. “Father,” he said, “since you

taught me to shoot a rifle, I have practiced and practiced until I am the best

shot for miles around. Let me hunt for food for our family.” Daniel’s father

agreed, and soon the Boones were feasting on wild turkey and deer.


In 1750, just before Daniel turned sixteen, the Boone family moved from

Pennsylvania to the Yadkin River Valley of North Carolina, settling at the

edge of the **frontier** . ~~_A frontier is an area of land that has not yet been_~~

~~_settled. [Point to the state of North Carolina on a map, and emphasize_~~

~~_that it is on the East Coast.]_~~ It did not take long for the other settlers in

his new home to discover that Daniel was one of the best **woodsmen** for

miles around. ~~_Woodsmen are people who live or work in the forest. Daniel_~~

~~_Boone lived and worked in the forest._~~ Daniel began to explore his new

surroundings. His explorations took him deep into the forests. He heard

tales of buffalo to the west and wanted to try hunting other animals than

the plentiful deer and bear that lived in the woods nearby. But Daniel was

unable to go as far west as he wanted to go. Something was stopping him

and other settlers from travelling farther west. Can you guess what it was?

~~_[Pause for students to respond. Ask students to explain their answer.]_~~


**Show Image 1A-8: U.S. map with Appalachian**

**Mountains highlighted**

There were enormous mountains standing

in his way! These mountains are called the

Appalachian Mountains, and they stretch for

miles, from the present-day state of Maine





all the way to Georgia. The mountains were

heavily wooded, making them difficult to



cross. They formed a natural **barrier** and blocked movement from one side

of the mountains to the other. For this reason, few European settlers had

left their colonies along the eastern coast of North America to travel west.

But Daniel knew that Native Americans had crisscrossed these mountains

for years. As he roamed through the densely forested hillsides, his curiosity

about lands to the west grew stronger. Daniel began to ask everyone he met

if they knew of a way to cross the mountains.

Daniel Boone continued to explore the

Appalachian Mountains, always on the lookout

for a path that might lead him to the other

side. One day he was visited by an old friend,

John Finley. As the two men talked, Daniel told





John of his desire to find a way to cross the

mountains. To his great surprise, Finley replied,

_Passes_ also means gives
something to someone

“Why, I know a way! I’ve crossed the Appalachians myself.” He told Daniel that

he knew of several big gaps in the mountains. ~~_A gap is a space between two_~~

~~_things. [Ask students to make a face that shows how Daniel Boone might have_~~

~~_felt when he heard that John knew a way to cross the Appalachian Mountains.]_~~


**Show Image 2A-2: Cumberland Gap**

Formed by rushing water years ago, the natural

gaps, or **passes**, through the mountains had

been trampled down by buffalo. Later Native

Americans had walked on them. ~~_Passes make_~~

~~_it easier to cross mountains than climbing_~~





~~_straight up to get to the other side._~~ One pass

was not too far from where Daniel Boone and



his family lived. “It’s in Virginia, and it’s called the Cumberland Gap,” Finley

told him. “It is an old Native American footpath.” ~~_You can only walk or ride a_~~

~~_horse on a footpath._~~ Boone was delighted! He asked John Finley to show him

how to find it.

Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


**Show Image 2A-3: Daniel Boone on the trail**

Not long after that, the two men set off with

four other men on a big adventure to find

the Cumberland Gap. ~~_[Point to the state_~~

~~_of Virginia on a U.S. map. The Cumberland_~~

~~_Gap is near Virginia’s borders with Kentucky_~~

~~_and Tennessee.]_~~ They walked and rode on

horseback for many miles before reaching



the beaten path that led up a steep side of the mountain. They spent long

days climbing up and up and up. Daniel’s skills as a woodsman helped him

identify animal tracks and follow the Native American footpath. ~~_Remember, a_~~

~~_woodsman is someone who lives or works in the forest._~~ They were overjoyed

to reach the top of the mountains where they could see a magnificent river

stretching out beneath them. Following a narrow footpath, the men finally

made it to the other side of the Appalachian Mountains, to the land that is

now known as Kentucky. ~~_Kentucky is located to the west of the Appalachian_~~

~~_Mountains, so Daniel Boone made it to the other side!_~~


**Show Image 2A-4: Daniel and friends hunting**

Daniel and his friends were pleased with what

they found on the other side of the mountains.

The land was rich and fertile, and there were

great herds of buffalo grazing on grasses. For

the next two years, Daniel Boone stayed in



Image Card 6





eastern Kentucky, hunting and trapping wild

animals. ~~_[Show Image Card 6 (Buffalo).] Daniel_~~



~~_Boone also used traps to catch animals. Boone used these animals for food_~~

~~_and for their fur._~~


**Show Image 2A-5: Daniel Boone and pioneers**

When he finally returned to North Carolina,

he was met by other settlers who expressed

an interest in leaving their homes in the east

and moving westward. These **pioneers** asked

Daniel if he could show them the way across





the Appalachian Mountains. ~~_A pioneer is one of_~~

~~_the first people to live in a new place._~~ “It’s not



an easy trip,” Boone told them. “The forests are dense, and there are many

dangers along the trail.”


Lesson 2 Crossing the Appalachian Mountains
**27**


**Show Image 2A-6: Appalachian Mountains**

But the pioneering spirit of these settlers

remained strong. Two years later, they

convinced Daniel that they were serious about

making the hard and dangerous trip to lands

in the **wilderness** . ~~_The wilderness refers to an_~~

~~_area of land with many wild plants and animals_~~

~~_and few people living there. Often, there are_~~



Support


A wagon is a vehicle with
four wheels that is pulled
by animals and can carry
heavy loads and people.


**28**



~~_few roads that go through the wilderness._~~ And so, Daniel led his own family,

along with several other families, back through the Cumberland Gap into

Kentucky. However, the trip proved even harder for families than it had been

for the woodsmen. The families were not used to living in the wild outdoors

like the woodsmen. Setting up a settlement in Kentucky was more difficult

than the pioneers expected, and they were forced to go back home over the

Appalachian Mountains.


Later, a businessman offered Daniel Boone a job to help widen some Native

American trails that crossed the Appalachian Mountains. He wanted Daniel

to make the trails wider and clearly marked so that pioneers would not lose

their way as they crossed the mountains. Daniel Boone became known as a

**trailblazer** . He helped to open up the way for pioneers to move west. ~~_Boone_~~

~~_helped to widen the Native American trails, making it easier for people to_~~

~~_make the journey to the other side of the Appalachians._~~


**Show Image 2A-7: Blazing the**

**Wilderness Road**

Daniel Boone gathered together a group of

men to help him clear the forest through the

wilderness. Together they worked through

rain, snow, and mud. They used axes to chop





down trees and bushes to widen the old Native

American footpath so that the pioneers’



wagons would fit. ~~_Remember, a footpath is only wide enough for walking_~~

~~_or riding a horse. A footpath is not wide enough for wagons._~~ They built log

bridges across streams. Daniel Boone and the men successfully cleared a

trail from eastern Virginia, through the Cumberland Gap, and into Kentucky.

The trail was originally Native American footpaths called The Great Warrior’s

Path. Later, it became known as the Wilderness Road. Pioneers from Virginia,

North Carolina, and Pennsylvania began to move along the Wilderness Road

in great numbers. By the time that Kentucky was declared a state, less than


Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


twenty years after the trail was widened, more than one hundred thousand

people had used the Wilderness Road. Daniel Boone’s hard work was

responsible for opening up the area known as “the West” to many pioneers.

As more and more settlers streamed into the west, relationships with Native

Americans who were already living there became even more strained. ~~_Native_~~

~~_Americans and settlers wanted to live on the same land, and sometimes_~~

~~_fought about it._~~


Check for Understanding


**Evaluate an Idea:** Why did the trail get the name Wilderness
Road? _(Answers may vary, but should include that it was a road_
_through what was the wilderness. Daniel Boone and others_
_widened and cleared Native American trails in the wilderness to_
_create a path across the Appalachian Mountains.)_


**Show Image 2A-8: Boonesborough**

Daniel Boone’s own family was the first

pioneer family to settle in Kentucky. Daniel

chose a spot near the Kentucky River to build

a fort. It took several years to complete the

fort. About as large as one city block, the fort







sheltered log cabins and the people that lived

in them. The fort was named Boonesborough

after Daniel Boone, the man who built it.


**Show Image 2A-9: Portrait of Daniel Boone**

Life was difficult for the pioneers in the

beginning, but people kept streaming across the

mountains. It was no longer a wilderness land.

He never gave up his love for the wilderness

and continued to explore lands to the west of

Kentucky until his death at the age of eighty-six.

~~**TEKS 1.1.C**~~


~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED? (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Using the timeline, remind students that the Read-Alouds they heard about
Daniel Boone took place prior to the United States becoming a country, when
the thirteen colonies had just started talking about declaring independence
from Great Britain.


**Show Image Card 5 (Daniel Boone), Image Card 7 (Eastern United**
**States)**

  - Ask students to explain what they learned about Daniel Boone and other
settlers’ desire to move west of the Appalachian Mountains. _(Answers may_
_vary, but may include: Daniel Boone was a woodsman who wanted to go west._
_The Wilderness Road that Daniel Boone helped create made it easier for_
_pioneer families to move west over the Appalachian Mountains, which in time_
_expanded the area of the United States. As these families moved west, fights_
_sometimes arose with Native American groups who were already living in the_
_area.)_


  - Tell students that the Read-Aloud they will hear today takes place about
thirty years after Daniel Boone made the Wilderness Road.


  - Explain that by this time, the colonies had already declared independence
from Great Britain, and Thomas Jefferson was the third president of the
country called the United States.

settled in lands on the other side of these mountains, pushing the borders of
the United States farther and farther west.


 - Point to the green area on the map, and then identify the city of New Orleans
and the Mississippi River.


 - Explain to students that, in the time period of today’s Read-Aloud, this area
of land, or territory, was not part of the United States. This part of North
America had been explored and settled by people from another European
country far across the Atlantic—the country of France.

Entering his office in Washington, D.C.,

Thomas Jefferson, president of the United

States, was pleased ~~_or glad_~~ to find his friend,

James Monroe, waiting for him. Monroe

politely rose to his feet, but President





Jefferson said, “Sit down, James. This is not

a formal meeting, as you can see.” In fact,



**40**



Thomas Jefferson was dressed in his robe and slippers! ~~_[Point to Monroe_~~

~~_and then Jefferson in the picture.]_~~


As the two men sat down, James Monroe thought to himself, “Thomas

Jefferson doesn’t try to make himself look fancy or important. But he is the

smartest, most interesting person I have ever known. How lucky I am to be

his friend!”


At the same time, President Jefferson was thinking, “James Monroe is

honest and intelligent, ~~_or smart_~~ and he is willing to work hard to do a good

job.” ~~_Monroe and Jefferson are describing each other’s characteristics. Do_~~

~~_you think Monroe and Jefferson sound like they would be good leaders for_~~

Speaking out loud now, the president said,

“James, I have an important job I want you to

do, one that I think you are especially well
suited to carry out: I want you to buy a city for

us.” ~~_Have you ever heard of someone buying a_~~

~~_whole city?_~~


“I beg your pardon!” James Monroe exclaimed

in surprise. “Buy a city?”



“Yes, I want to send you to France to see the Emperor Napoleon, who

rules France and half of Europe as well. ~~_An emperor is a ruler, like a king._~~

~~_[Remind students about the emperors they learned about in_~~ ~~Early American~~

~~Civilizations~~ ~~_.]_~~ When you reach France, I want you to buy the city of New

Orleans from Napoleon.”


**Show Image 3A-4: Map of the early**

**United States**

James Monroe knew that the city of New

Orleans sat near the **mouth** of the Mississippi

River. ~~_The mouth of the Mississippi River is_~~

~~_where the river empties into the ocean._~~ French

settlers started settling in New Orleans many

years ago because they knew that ships and

boats could travel up and down the Mississippi River, allowing people to

buy and sell things all along the length of the great Mississippi River. ~~_[Trace_~~

~~_ships’ journeys up and down the Mississippi River on the map.] It was easier_~~

~~_than walking or using a horse and wagon._~~ James Monroe knew that France

still owned New Orleans, plus a great deal of land west of the Mississippi

River stretching all the way to the Rocky Mountains. ~~_[Point to the Rocky_~~

~~_Mountains on the map. Explain to students that France owned the land from_~~

~~_the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains.]_~~


Jefferson stopped and stared into the flames of the fire by which they sat, for

it was a chilly morning. Then he continued, “As you know, James, our nation,

the United States, is on the eastern side of the Mississippi, while the area

that France has claimed is on the western side. ~~_[Point to the orange area on_~~

~~_the map, which represents the size of the United States at that time.]_~~

**41**


Challenge


Ask students what they
think President Jefferson
was worried might happen
if Napoleon got angry.


**42**





**Show Image 3A-5: A frontier village along**

**the Mississippi**

“More and more Americans are moving near

the Mississippi and building towns and cities

along the river. We must make sure Americans

can do business up and down the river if we

are going to build up that part of the United

States. Right now, France and the United



States are friends, and Napoleon lets American ships pass by New Orleans

on their way from the ocean up and down the river; but if Napoleon ever grew

angry with us . . .” ~~_Americans were able to sail past New Orleans on their way_~~

~~_from the ocean up and down the river._~~


“I understand,” said James Monroe. “Napoleon could stop our ships and

boats from bringing us the things we need. He could stop our farmers in

that part of the country from sending food they grow to the rest of us back

east, or stop people in the east from shipping farm tools to the farmers. I

understand why New Orleans is important. But why would Napoleon want to

sell the city?”


**Show Image 3A-6: Napoleon Bonaparte in**
**battle** ~~_[Have students describe the man in_~~

~~_the image.]_~~

Jefferson answered, “Napoleon needs as much

money as he can get his hands on so that he

can pay for supplies, uniforms, food, and ships





for his soldiers and sailors because France is

fighting in a war in Europe. We will offer to pay



him the money he wants, which will make _him_ happy, and we will get control

of the river, which will make _us_ happy.”


“Napoleon certainly seems to have a reason to sell New Orleans to us,”

said Monroe.


Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


**Show Image 3A-7: Napoleon Bonaparte**

~~_[Tell students that this is a picture of the_~~

~~_emperor Napoleon.]_~~

Jefferson replied, “He may have a reason, but

we must get Napoleon to agree to the sale. He

can be very difficult to work with, James. He

thinks he is the most important person alive. If

he believes you think so, too, he can be a **loyal**,



powerful friend. ~~_Loyal friends show their support for you no matter what_~~

~~_happens._~~ On the other hand, if he thinks you do not see him as important,

or do not agree with his ideas, he will have his servants throw you out of his

palace and slam the door. James, you are so likeable, he’ll want to work with

you. If you succeed, you will help us to open up the whole western part of our

country that is near the Mississippi River. Will you try?” ~~_If James Monroe is_~~

~~_successful, Americans would be able to settle even farther west._~~


**Show Image 3A-8: Jefferson and Monroe**

**shaking hands**

James Monroe stood up. “It will be my honor

to do so,” he said. Thomas Jefferson arose and

the two friends shook hands. As he turned to

go, James Monroe thought, “When I came here





this morning, I had no idea I would be going to

France for the president of the United States!

And just think—I am going there to buy a city!”

_Jefferson’s friend._ )


**Show Image 3A-4: Map of the early United States**


2. **Inferential.** [Point to the Mississippi River and New Orleans, and remind
students that at the time period of this Read-Aloud, this part of North

Americans were settling nearby and using the Mississippi River.] At the time
period of this Read-Aloud, how did people use the Mississippi River? ( _Ships_
_and boats traveled up and down it, carrying people and supplies._ ) Why did
people use the river? ( _It was easier than walking or using horses._ )


3. **Inferential.** Why did Thomas Jefferson want to buy New Orleans? ( _He_

_Orleans on their way to or from the Mississippi River and the ocean._ )


4. **Literal.** Who was Napoleon? ( _Napoleon was the emperor or leader of France._ )

   - **Inferential.** Why was Thomas Jefferson worried that Napoleon might
suddenly stop American ships from passing through New Orleans? _(In_
_order to get to the Mississippi River from the ocean, people had to go_
_through New Orleans. If Napoleon suddenly stopped American ships from_
_passing through New Orleans, Americans wouldn’t be able to use the_

Jefferson.

Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


James Monroe, “I want you to go to France and offer to **purchase** ~~_or buy_~~ the

city of New Orleans from Napoleon. Napoleon needs money to buy supplies

for his soldiers and sailors, who are fighting in a series of wars. If he will

sell New Orleans to us, he will receive the money he needs, and we will gain

control of the Mississippi River.”


**Show Image 4A-3: James Monroe and**

**Napoleon Bonaparte**

James Monroe met with Napoleon in the

French emperor’s palace in Paris, France. This

palace was very different from the house in

which President Thomas Jefferson lived in





Washington, D.C.


Now as James Monroe looked back on his



meetings with both President Jefferson and the French Emperor, Napoleon,

Monroe thought, “President Jefferson’s home certainly is different from

Napoleon’s home. Napoleon lives in a grand palace with fine wooden floors

half-covered in thick carpets. The walls are bright with expensive wallpapers,

and the furniture probably cost a lot of money. When Napoleon dresses

in the fanciest clothes and sits on that throne, he talks and everyone else

listens because they are afraid of his power, and they hope he will do favors

for them. ~~_[Remind students that Napoleon was an emperor and had powers_~~

~~_like a king.]_~~


**Show Image 4A-4: Thomas Jefferson**

“But there are no thrones for Thomas

Jefferson and no royal uniforms to make

him look special. Sometimes visitors to the

presidential mansion ~~_or large house_~~ don’t even

recognize President Jefferson. They think he is





one of the servants until they are introduced

to him. When he starts to speak, however,



everyone listens, but not because they are afraid of him. They listen because

he is a brilliant man with wonderful ideas. ~~_Monroe thinks that President_~~

~~_Jefferson is very smart._~~ He doesn’t need thrones or royal robes in order for

people to realize that he is a great man.”


Lesson 4 The Louisiana Purchase

Challenge


Have students compare
and contrast Image 4A-5

the two men look similar
and different.


Support


Remind students that in
_Animals and Habitats_, they
learned another definition
of _territory_ : an area in
which an animal or group
of animals lives.


**56**







**Show Image 4A-5: Napoleon Bonaparte**

“Well,” James Monroe thought, “I suppose I

should be fair. Napoleon may not be my sort

of person, but he is very clever once you are

talking seriously with him; and he is about to

do a great favor for the United States.” ~~Clever~~

~~_means smart and able to think and figure_~~

~~_things out quickly._~~


**Show Image 4A-6: Monroe and Napoleon**

~~_[Point out Napoleon and Monroe in the picture.]_~~

Monroe remembered his last meeting with

Napoleon, during which Napoleon had told

Monroe, “I have thought over your president’s

offer to buy the city of New Orleans. I have

decided that selling New Orleans to the United

States of America will not bring me as much

money as I need.


**Show Image 4A-7: Map of the early United**

**States**

“Instead, I will sell you New Orleans _and_

all the lands owned by France between the

Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains,

which is called the Louisiana **Territory** . ~~_[Point_~~

~~_to the green area on the map that represents_~~

~~_the Louisiana Territory, and explain that the_~~



~~_word_~~ ~~territory~~ ~~_means an area of land controlled by a specific country or_~~

~~_government.]_~~ We will sell this land to you at a fair price.” ~~_Did Napoleon want_~~

~~_to sell just New Orleans? What did he want to sell?_~~


Hearing this, Monroe realized with a shock, “That is as much land as there

is already in the _entire_ United States of America! Overnight, we could have a

nation twice as big as it is right now!” ~~_Twice as big means two times as big._~~


Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


Check for Understanding


**Evaluate an Idea:** Do you think Monroe was excited or
disappointed by Napoleon’s suggestion? How do you know?
_(excited; Monroe realized Napoleon’s suggestion would make the_
_United States twice as big as it is now, which would be great for the_
_United States_ )


**Show Image 4A-8: James Monroe and**

**Napoleon Bonaparte**

Somehow Monroe had kept himself calm

enough to answer Napoleon. “Your Majesty,

this is indeed a marvelous opportunity. I

cannot accept your offer, however, until I





present it to President Jefferson and receive

his answer. I will write to him at once.”



In Monroe’s time, there was no phone or email, so Monroe had to write

a letter to Jefferson. ~~_Here, the word_~~ ~~letter~~ ~~_means a written message to_~~

~~_someone._~~ The letter would have to travel over the ocean in the same kind of

ship that Monroe had traveled on when he first came to France. It would take

a few weeks for Jefferson to get Monroe’s letter and even longer for Monroe

to get Jefferson’s answer.


**Show Image 4A-9: Monroe writing to**

**Jefferson**

Now, sitting in his hotel room and

remembering all this, James Monroe picked up

his pen. “I need to finish my letter to President

Jefferson,” he thought, “and then I can send

ocean to the United States. When he reads



it, the president is going to be very surprised.” ~~_Why did Monroe think that_~~

~~_Jefferson would be surprised?_~~


Lesson 4 The Louisiana Purchase
**57**


**Show Image 4A-10: Jefferson reading**

**Monroe’s letter**

Just as Monroe had expected, Thomas

Jefferson was amazed when he read the

letter. Jefferson thought, “This is even better

than I could have imagined! Not only will we

be buying the city of New Orleans, but also

the entire Louisiana Territory. The United



**58**



States will double in size, or grow two times as big! I will write back to James

Monroe at once, telling him to purchase the Louisiana Territory for the United

States.” He smiled. “The timing could not be better.” Then President Jefferson

picked up his pen and began the letter instructing Monroe to seal the bargain

with France, a bargain that would double the size of the United States of

America. ~~Seal the bargain~~ ~~_means that Jefferson wanted Monroe to accept_~~

~~_Napoleon’s offer and buy the Louisiana Territory. A bargain is a great deal._~~

~~_[Tell students that when the United States bought the Louisiana Territory from_~~

~~_France, it was called the Louisiana Purchase.]_~~

1. **Literal.** Who did James Monroe meet in France in order to discuss the
purchase of the city of New Orleans? _(Napoleon)_


2. **Literal.** Was James Monroe able to buy the city of New Orleans from
Napoleon? _(yes)_ What else did Napoleon sell to the United States? _(Napoleon_
_also sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States.)_

3. **Literal.** Point to the area of land called the Louisiana Territory, which the
United States bought from France. _(Students should point to the area_
_between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains.)_


4. **Inferential.** What was the Louisiana Purchase? ( _The Louisiana Purchase_
_was the land called the Louisiana Territory that the United States bought from_
_France._ )

   - **Inferential.** Was the Louisiana Territory a lot of land or a little land? ( _The_
_Louisiana Territory was a lot of land._ ) How do you know? ( _We know that it was_
_a lot of land because it doubled the size of the United States at that time._ )


5. **Evaluative.** Why was the Louisiana Purchase significant for the United
States? _(It doubled the size of the country at the time; it provided more land_
_for settlers to move to and explore; it gave the United States control of the_
_land to the west of the Mississippi River in addition to the land to the east of it)_

describe how America grew in size from the original thirteen colonies to a
much larger country.


  - Ask students the following questions to review what they have learned:


    - Who was Daniel Boone and why was he important? _(Daniel Boone was_
_a woodsman who wanted to go west. With help from others, he widened_
_Native American trails to create the Wilderness Road, which people could_
_use to cross the Appalachian Mountains to go west and settle. He is known_
_as a trailblazer.)_


    - How were Native Americans affected by settlers moving west? _(As more_
_pioneer families moved west over the Appalachian Mountains, the United_
_States expanded. As these families moved west, fights sometimes arose_
_with Native American groups who were already living in the area.)_


    - [Point to the image of Thomas Jefferson on the timeline.] Who is this

We learned last time about the Louisiana
Purchase, when the United States government
purchased the Louisiana Territory from France.
Once the purchase of the Louisiana Territory
was complete, President Thomas Jefferson
wanted to send explorers to make maps of this
new land and learn more about it.


**Show Image 5A-2: Jefferson musing on the**
**possibilities**



Thinking about the Louisiana Territory,
Jefferson wondered, “Is it possible that there
are tigers or elephants living out there in
those unexplored western lands? No one

there are plants whose leaves could be used
as medicines to help sick people, or which would be delicious to eat. My
Native American friends who live there have brought me a few plants to
study, but I am sure there must be more plants and animals which even
they have not seen.”





**TEKS 1.6.G** Evaluate details to determine what is most important with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and

Lesson 5 Lewis and Clark
**71**


Jefferson prepared to send explorers into the Louisiana Territory.


“I need the leader of these explorers to be someone I can trust, someone
very **brave** and very smart.” ~~_A brave person is someone who shows courage_~~
~~_and is not afraid to do something, even if it may be dangerous or frightening._~~


**Show Image 5A-3: Meriwether Lewis**


President Jefferson suddenly smiled. “Why, I
know just the person for the job.”





He sat down and wrote a letter to his former
assistant, ~~_or helper_~~ a man named Meriwether
Lewis. Jefferson asked Meriwether Lewis if he
would lead the team of explorers.


**Show Image 5A-4: Lewis and Clark’s**
**projected path** ~~_[Share that the path they_~~
~~_planned to take is in red.]_~~


Jefferson had three reasons for wanting Lewis
to explore the Louisiana Territory. ~~_[Point out_~~
~~_the different landmarks on the map as you talk_~~
~~_about them.]_~~



Challenge


Ask students to explain
why it was important that
Lewis and Clark make sure
Native Americans knew
they came to offer peace.


**72**



Jefferson wrote to Lewis, “First, I want you to find out if there is an all-water
route to the Pacific Ocean. Travel the Missouri River, which branches out to the
west from the Mississippi River. The two big rivers meet at St. Louis, so you
could start the trip along the Missouri from there. Perhaps the Missouri River
flows all the way to the Pacific Ocean, or if it does not, maybe it connects to
other rivers that do reach the Pacific Ocean. You can find out for us. Second,
you can collect samples of plants and animals so that we will know what
grows well in the lands we have just added to our nation. Third, you must also
become friends with the Native Americans you meet. You will want to bring
along presents for them so they will know you come to offer peace.”


Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


Check for Understanding


**Use Evidence:** What were the three reasons Jefferson wanted
Lewis and Clark to explore the Louisiana Territory. [You may wish
to make a list on the board or chart paper.] _(find out if there is an_
_all-water route to the Pacific Ocean; collect samples of plants and_
_animals; become friends with Native Americans)_


**Show Image 5A-5: Lewis writing to Jefferson**





When Meriwether Lewis received the
president’s letter, he was very excited.
However, he was a thoughtful man. He wrote
back, “I am very honored that you have asked
me to do this, Mr. President, and I will do my
very best for you and for our nation. With your
permission, however, I will ask a friend of mine,
William Clark, to help me with these tasks.


**Show Image 5A-6: William Clark** ~~_This is_~~
~~_William Clark, Meriwether Lewis’s friend._~~



“William Clark and I became great friends
when we served together in the army. He and
I work well together. Clark is very good at
drawing maps, identifying plants and animals,

Americans. I would feel much more certain
that we could do the things you ask if William Clark could accompany me as
co-captain.” ~~_A co-captain is someone who shares responsibility as captain or_~~
~~_leader with someone else. Lewis wanted to share the job of captain with Clark._~~
President Jefferson agreed.





Support


The prefix _co–_ means
together or with. The
word _co-captain_ means
captains together or
captain with someone else
at the same time.





**Show Image 5A-7: Lewis and Clark preparing**
**for the journey**


As Lewis and Clark prepared to start on their
journey, they did not know that the dangers
and wonders they were about to face together
would make their friendship even stronger.

~~_and Clark may find?_~~

~~**“LEWIS AND CLARK: THE JOURNEY BEGINS” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 6A-1: Lewis and Clark preparing**
**for their journey**

Before they began their exploration of the

Louisiana Territory, Meriwether Lewis traveled

to Indiana to join William Clark and gather

their team of explorers. Lewis explained,





“As I wrote in my letters, Will, because the

United States government is paying for this



exploration, we will travel as members of the U.S. Army. I asked that we be

made co-captains so we would have equal command over our men.”


**Show Image 6A-2: Frontier town**

Soon they traveled to the city of St. Louis,

where the wide Missouri River flows into the

even mightier Mississippi River. ~~_[Point to_~~

~~_these locations on a U.S. map.]_~~ St. Louis was

a frontier town. Its streets and stores bustled





with hunters and trappers who had chosen

to live far beyond the more settled cities of



**82**



the east. ~~_Trappers are people who hunt and catch animals to use their fur for_~~

~~_clothing and blankets._~~

Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


**Show Image 6A-3: Part of Lewis and Clark’s**

**team**

The two captains knew that it would take

courage, intelligence, and skill to reach the

Pacific, so they looked for people who knew

how to survive ~~_or stay alive_~~ in forests and on

rivers and mountains. These people would

need to know how to hunt and fish for food



and build shelters in which they could stay warm, dry, and safe. ~~_There were_~~

~~_no houses or hotels in the Louisiana Territory, so people had to be able to_~~

~~_make their own shelters to sleep in._~~ Some were Americans who had grown

up in Virginia or Pennsylvania, and who had later moved farther west to live

in Kentucky. Others were Canadians, from the country north of the United

States, who spoke French as well as English. ~~_[Show students each location_~~

~~_on a map.]_~~ The two captains finally put together a team of trusty men who

were daring and brave enough for the **expedition** . ~~_An expedition is a group of_~~

~~_people traveling together for some special reason, such as exploring._~~


**Show Image 6A-4: George Drouillard**

Among the men who joined Lewis and Clark’s

group, one man stood out. He appeared before

them one day dressed half in manufactured

clothing and half in the animal skins favored by

woodsmen. “I am George Drouillard

_Manufactured clothing_
means clothing made
using fabric, like cotton
or wool. Woodsmen often
liked wearing animal skins
for clothing, which came
directly from the animals
they hunted.






[/droo*yar/],” he told them. “I hear you are

going all the way to the Pacific. Ask the others



you have already hired about me. They all know me. I speak French, English,

and some Native American languages, so I can help you **communicate** with

your men and with many native people you meet. ~~To communicate~~ ~~_means_~~

~~_to share your thoughts with others. Speaking is one way of communicating._~~

I also know the hand sign languages used by Native Americans who live out

on the great western plains. When different tribes meet, they use this sign

language, since their spoken languages are not all the same. ~~_Sign language_~~

~~_is another way of communicating, by using your hands._~~ I can ask them about

the country ahead, and help them understand that you have come in peace.”

Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** Do you think George Drouillard would be
helpful during the expedition? Why or why not? [Call on student
pairs to share their answers.] _(Answers may vary, but may include:_
_yes, he will be helpful because he knows many spoken languages_
_and some Native American sign languages and can help the group_
_communicate with others; his clothing of animal skins implies he is_
_a woodsman and likely knows how to survive in the wilderness; he_
_says the men already hired can vouch for him as a good person to_
_have along.)_


**Show Image 6A-5: Pirogue and keelboat**

Lewis and Clark had to gather supplies as well

as people. They were going to need to take a

lot of things with them on their trip.


They purchased some long, narrow canoes





called “pirogues” [/pee*roegz/], and one

larger, wider boat called a keelboat. ~~_[Point to_~~

~~_the pirogue and the keelboat in the picture.]_~~ On



**84**



the deck of the keelboat stood a little cabin that held supplies.


Riders in the pirogues moved their narrow boats forward using canoe

paddles, but the keelboat had a sail. Moving the keelboat was slower and

more difficult than moving a pirogue. When a strong enough wind was behind

the riders, it pushed the keelboat along, but if there was no wind, the men

had to take turns pushing and pulling it with poles and ropes.


Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


**Show Image 6A-6: Setting out**

On Monday, May 14, 1804, the explorers were

ready. They called themselves the **Corps**

[/ kor/] _of Discovery_ . ~~_A corps is a group of_~~

~~_people working together._~~ Now they would leave

St. Louis and travel west along the Missouri,

as President Jefferson had requested. As one

of them, Private John Whitehouse, wrote in his



**diary** that day, “We . . . hoisted [our] sail, and set out in high spirits for the

western expedition.” ~~_A diary is a book or journal for writing down personal_~~

~~_thoughts and experiences._~~ At last they were on their way.


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Evaluative.** Imagine you were going with Lewis and Clark as part of the
Corps of Discovery and you wouldn’t be home for many months. What kinds
of things do you think you would need to take with you? _(Answers may_
_vary, but may include: food; water; clothes; tools, for such things as building_
_shelters, hunting, and cutting down bushes and trees; supplies, for such things_
_as gathering samples of plants and animals, staying protected from the_
_weather; etc._ )


2. **Inferential.** The people that Lewis and Clark chose to take with them on
their trip had many different skills. Name a few of their skills. _(Some of the_
_skills were survival skills, such as knowing how to hunt, fish, and build shelters,_
_as well as language skills, such as the ability to speak many languages.)_ Why
were these skills important? _(The people on the expedition would have to find_
_their own food, build their own shelters, and talk with Native Americans._ )


**Show Image 5A-4: Lewis and Clark’s projected path**


3. **Literal.** Where did Lewis and Clark begin their journey? ( _Lewis and Clark_
_began their journey in the city of St. Louis on the Missouri River._ )


4. **Inferential.** Why did the Corps of Discovery travel up the river instead of on
foot? ( _It was easier to travel and transport things on the river. There were no_
_roads yet, so in order to travel you had to travel on foot or on a horse and cut_
_down plants in your path. In addition, one of their tasks was to find an all-_
_water route to the Pacific Ocean._ )

~~**“DISCOVERY AND DANGER ON THE PRAIRIE” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 7A-1: Clark and the Great Plains**

On July 19, 1804, William Clark found himself

at the edge of an ocean. It was not the Pacific

Ocean, the vast sea to the west that Clark and

his friends hoped to reach. In fact, it was not

an ocean of water at all. It was a large, flat





area of land covered in grass called a **prairie** .

~~_A prairie is also called a grassland. [Talk with_~~



~~_students about the grassland habitat they learned about in the_~~ ~~Animals and~~

~~Habitats~~ ~~_unit, the savanna.]_~~ A prairie goes on as far as the eye can see, just

like the ocean. ~~_So the prairie looked like an ocean because it went on as far as_~~

~~_the eye could see, just like an ocean seems to do when you look at it._~~


Clark was out hunting for the expedition and spotted some elk tracks, which

he followed up a hill. He later described what he found at the top. “I came

suddenly into an open and boundless prairie. I could not see [the edges] in

any direction. This . . . was so sudden and entertaining that I forgot the [elk

I had been following].” Clark had reached the eastern edge of what today

we call “The Great Plains.” Wild grass as high as Clark’s knees stretched out

and blew gently in the wind, interrupted every so often by a hill or a grove of

trees. That sea of grass stretched all the way to the distant Rocky Mountains,

pronghorns for short. He tried to get close





enough to draw pictures of them, but the

pronghorns always ran away. Pronghorns

have incredibly sharp eyesight and a strong sense of smell to warn them

of approaching danger. When Lewis finally came close to a pronghorn and

got a good look at the long, curved horns that give the animal its name, he

wrote, “The speed of this animal is equal, if not superior, to that of the finest

[racing horse.] [The pronghorn] is my favorite of all the animals we have

encountered so far.”


**Show Image 7A-3: Prairie dog**

The explorers were also astonished by

the prairie dog, a tiny rodent. These little

creatures, related to squirrels, lived together

by the thousands in what the men came

to call “prairie dog towns.” The prairie dog





towns consisted of underground tunnels that

sometimes stretched out for miles across



the flat plains. “We have to catch one of these to send back to President

Jefferson,” William Clark declared. But catching a prairie dog was not so

easy. One prairie dog, standing guard above its hole in the ground, saw the

men coming and chirped a high pitched warning. Instantly, all the creatures

dived down into the ground. The men dug down after them but found that

the tunnels went down more than six feet below the surface, spreading out in

all directions with emergency exits to escape their many predators—hawks,

coyotes, and snakes—all of whom considered prairie dogs to be delicious

snacks. Clark wrote down their findings about the prairie dog and pronghorn

antelope in his journal.

Still following the Missouri River across the

One September afternoon, John Colter, one of

the expedition’s best hunters, was following

the tracks of an animal. Colter dismounted

from ~~_or got off_~~ his horse to look more closely.

Some Teton Sioux, hiding among the nearby

trees on their own horses, shouted and rushed

forward, riding off with Colter’s horse. Colter



walked back to the river and reported to Lewis and Clark what had happened.

Minutes later, five Teton Sioux appeared on the shore calling out to talk to

Lewis and Clark. Captain Clark answered, “We will not speak with you until

our horse is returned.”


**Show Image 7A-7: Confrontation**

Minutes later, more than two hundred Teton

warriors, all armed with bows and arrows, rode

out from the trees and spread out along the

riverbank. ~~_Warriors are people who fight in a_~~

~~_battle. The Teton Sioux were prepared to fight_~~





~~_to protect their land._~~



Lesson 7 Discovery and Danger on the Prairie
**9587**


Captain Lewis remembered that President Jefferson wanted them to be

friends with the Teton Sioux. He quietly ordered, “Stop the boats and hold

them steady here in the middle of the river.” Clark, smiling, called, “We come

as friends from our great chief.” The chief that Clark was talking about was

President Jefferson. “We invite your chiefs to come and see our great boat.”


**Show Image 7A-8: Giving gifts**

Clark ordered a few sailors to row him to shore

in a pirogue, and after greeting the three main

chiefs, Clark brought two of them aboard the

keelboat. There he and Lewis were friendly

to the Teton Sioux and gave them gifts. Then







Clark and the oarsmen took the chiefs back

to the shore. ~~_[Point to the oarsman in the_~~

~~_picture.]_~~


**Show Image 7A-9: Taking the leaders back to**

**shore** ~~_[Point to the boat in the picture.]_~~

Meanwhile, Captain Lewis stood ready on the

keelboat’s bow, and his soldiers kept rifles in

their hands or right by their sides in case of

trouble. Everything seemed to be going well

until suddenly one chief shouted, “Your gifts

are not good enough. You may not return



to your big boat until you give us better gifts.” Sioux warriors grabbed the

pirogue’s rope and held it securely.


**Show Image 7A-10: Clark’s bluff**

Clark knew that the Teton Sioux **honored**

courage. ~~_The Teton Sioux admired and_~~

~~_respected people who acted bravely._~~ If he

showed any sign of weakness at this moment,





the Tetons might attack. Even if there were no

fight, any chance of a strong friendship with

the Tetons could disappear. Clark whipped his



**96**



sword out, and holding it high, firmly demanded, “Release our boat _at once_ !”


Back on the keelboat, Lewis ordered his men, “Prepare arms! Only on my

order may you fire, and _not a second_ before.” Instantly, the soldiers raised


Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


their rifles. In answer, the Tetons raised their bows and set arrows, ready to

shoot at the Corps of Discovery.


No one moved. The silence stretched out for a long, tense moment. Then a

Sioux chief told the warriors holding the rope, “Let go.” They obeyed. Clark

told his oarsmen, “Return to the keelboat.”


One of his men asked quietly, “Without you, sir?”


“I gave you an order,” Clark said in a voice that sounded much calmer than he

actually felt.


**Show Image 7A-11: Clark surrounded**

As the pirogue pushed off from the riverbank,

Teton warriors surrounded Clark. Lewis could

see only his friend’s hat over the shoulders

of the Sioux. Lewis gave orders, and as the

pirogue reached the keelboat, a number







of armed soldiers got into the pirogue and

started back for Clark. But then, suddenly, the

Tetons moved away from Clark.


**Show Image 7A-12: Truce at last**

Clark’s bravery had impressed the Tetons. The

Tetons thought that Clark was brave because

he stood up to them. They smiled in friendship

and invited the members of the expedition

to their village. The explorers accepted the

invitation. The Corps of Discovery had survived

a dangerous situation. What they did not know



was that even greater dangers, and even greater victories, still lay ahead.

~~**ELPS 2.G; ELPS 2.I**~~


**98**



~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What is the area called where today’s Read-Aloud took place? ( _the_
_Great Plains._ )

   - **Literal.** What animals did Lewis and Clark encounter? ( _prairie dogs and_
_pronghorn antelope_ )


   - **Literal.** Before Lewis and Clark’s explorations, pioneer families living
in the United States had not explored or settled the Louisiana Territory.
Who had been living on that land for thousands of years? ( _Many Native_
_American tribes had lived there for a long time._ )


**Show Image Card 17 (Yankton Sioux) and Image Card 18 (Teton**
**Sioux)**


2. **Evaluative.** In the Read-Aloud, Lewis and Clark met two different Native
American tribes, the Yankton Sioux and the Teton Sioux. How were their
meetings with the two tribes different? How were they the same? ( _The_
_Yankton Sioux were friendly and guided the corps for several days, but the_
_Teton Sioux were not friendly. The Teton Sioux were prepared to fight the_
_corps. Eventually, both became friends with Lewis and Clark._ )


3. **Literal.** Which of President Jefferson’s tasks did Lewis and Clark accomplish
in the Read-Aloud? ( _Lewis and Clark accomplished two tasks: making friends_
_with Native Americans and encountering, but only making notes about rather_
_than collecting, new animals and plants._ )


Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** The title of this Read-Aloud is “Discovery and
Danger on the Prairie.” What do you think was discovered that was
new to Lewis and Clark and what was dangerous in this ReadAloud? ( _Answers may vary, but should include Lewis and Clark_
_encountered a new landscape, the prairie; they encountered new_
_animals, prairie dogs and pronghorn antelopes; and they were in a_
_dangerous situation with the Teton Sioux who were ready to fight_
_them._ )


Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


~~**WORD WORK: HONORED (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Clark knew that the Teton Sioux honored courage.”


2. Say the word _honored_ with me.


3. What is the root word of _honored_ ? _(honor)_ When you honor something,
you respect or admire it. The Native Americans in the Read-Aloud honored
courage, meaning they respected and admired people with courage.


4. I honor people who are kind.


5. What kind of people do you honor? [Ask two or three students. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase students’ responses: “I honor people who are .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Discussion activity for follow-up.** With a partner, talk about what
actions or characteristics of a person would make you honor that person. Do
you honor kindness or determination? Do you honor different characteristics
or actions? Be sure to use the word _honor_ and answer in complete sentences.

~~**“SACAGAWEA” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 8A-1: Approaching winter**

As autumn approached, Lewis and Clark were

in a hurry. They knew the Rocky Mountains

lay ahead, and they hoped to spend the

winter there among the Mandan and Hidatsa

[/ hi*dot*s ə /]. ~~_The Mandan and Hidatsa are_~~





~~_two Native American tribes who had been_~~

~~_friendly to Lewis and Clark._~~ However, it was



already so cold that the river was freezing into ice, and when the river froze, it

was impossible to travel up the river in their boats.


**Show Image 8A-2: Mandan village**

Where the Knife River flows into the Missouri,

Lewis and Clark found five villages of Hidatsa

and Mandan Native Americans. ~~_[Point out_~~

~~_where the Knife River flows into the Missouri_~~

~~_River on a U.S. map.]_~~ Like other Native





Americans living on the plains, these people

hunted bison—also known as buffalo—from

horseback. They also lived in **permanent** earth lodges and farmed the land


**TEKS 1.6.G** Evaluate details to determine what is most important with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and

Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


around their homes. ~~_This means they had shelters that they did not move,_~~

~~_unlike nomads who moved their shelters with them._~~ Four or five families

shared each lodge, and even the horses spent bad weather days inside, in a

roped-off space just inside the entrance.


The Mandans especially welcomed the travelers from the east, because they were

used to visitors. Other Native American tribes and trappers came to the Mandan

area to share news and to buy and sell furs from beavers, bear, elk, or bison.


**Show Image 8A-3: Fort walls**

Across the river from one of the Mandan

villages, the explorers built a wooden house

and surrounded it with log walls eighteen feet

high for **protection** . ~~_They made the high log_~~

~~_walls to keep them safe._~~ The men of the Corps







of Discovery called their winter home “Fort

Mandan,” named after the Mandan Native

Americans.


**Show Image 8A-4: Wintertime troubles**

They dragged the pirogues onto the riverbank,

but before they could move the keelboat, the

river froze around it. It took three weeks to

chop the keelboat out of the ice. ~~_When the_~~

~~_river froze, it froze around the boat, and the_~~

~~_keelboat became stuck in the ice._~~


They had other worries, too. Lewis told Clark,



“We are eating so much food that we will run out before the winter is over,

and in this terrible weather, it is getting harder to hunt.”


**Show Image 8A-5: Mandan interactions**

Thankfully, the Mandans appeared one day

to tell them, “We have found a herd of bison

nearby. Come hunting with us. We have

brought horses for you to ride.” The result

~~_dropped quickly_~~ to thirty, even forty, degrees below zero, the explorers also

traded with the Mandan for food. In return for the food the Mandan gave

them, Lewis and Clark acted as doctors for members of the tribes who were

sick or injured, and several of the explorers who were skilled ~~_or talented_~~ as

blacksmiths made iron tools, axes, and arrowheads for the Mandans.


The party spent many cold nights asking the Hidatsas and Mandans about the

country that lay ahead. Lewis and Clark kept all the information they learned in

a journal. ~~_Why do you think Lewis and Clark kept information in a journal?_~~


**Show Image 8A-6: Charbonneau and**
**Sacagawea**

Then one day, a French-Canadian trader

appeared at the gates of Fort Mandan. He

announced, “I am Toussaint Charbonneau

[/ too*son/ /shar*bon*noe/]. I heard about





you from the Hidatsas. I am an excellent cook,

and I speak English, French, and several Native



American languages. I could cook for you and **translate** what is said in other

languages into English.” ~~_Lewis and Clark couldn’t speak any Native American_~~

~~_languages, so they needed people who could talk to them and also to Native_~~

~~_Americans they would meet. Also, one of their three tasks was to befriend_~~

~~_Native Americans._~~


Charbonneau had not come alone. With him was his pregnant wife, a young

Native American woman named Sacagawea [/sak* ə *j ə *wee* ə /]. Sacagawea

was a member of the Shoshone [/sh ə *shoe*nee/] tribe who lived farther

along the Missouri River. The Shoshone were the next tribe that Lewis and

Clark expected to meet. Lewis and Clark discussed Charbonneau’s offer.

“Sacagawea could be helpful when we reach the lands of the Shoshone.

She could show the Shoshone that we come as friends, and she knows a lot

about the countryside there. ~~_Lewis and Clark thought that Sacagawea could_~~

~~_be a guide and a translator for the expedition._~~ As for Charbonneau, if he is the

cook he claims to be, he will be a welcome addition to our party.”


Lewis told Charbonneau, “We want you and your wife to join us, and of course

we will pay you, Charbonneau, for your work.”


Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


**Show Image 8A-7: Charbonneau, Clark,**

**Sacagawea with her son**

This turned out to be one of the best decisions

the co-captains ever made, and while they

had agreed to hire two new members of the

expedition, they soon had three. One cold

night, Sacagawea gave birth to a little boy.

Charbonneau, the new father, looked proudly



at his newborn son and said, “We shall call you Jean Baptiste [/zshon/

/ bap*teest/] Charbonneau.” William Clark laughed. “That’s an awfully big

name for such a little fellow to carry. I’ll call him ‘Pompey.’” Pompey proved

to be a good little traveler, too. ~~_Sacagawea’s baby was nicknamed Pomp_~~

~~_or Pompey._~~


Lewis and Clark organized their notes and drawings and labeled samples of

plants and animals they had gathered. ~~_Remember, this was one of their three_~~

~~_tasks requested by President Jefferson._~~ When spring came, Clark announced,

“We have decided to split the party into two groups. We will send some

of you back east to take President Jefferson the things we have collected

and written. The rest of us will continue west.” Remember, there were no

telephones and no e-mail yet, and there was no way to send mail in the

Louisiana Territory. Lewis and Clark sent some of the Corps of Discovery to

tell Jefferson of their progress and what they had found so far.


**Show Image 8A-8: Parting ways**

On April 7, 1805, some of the party returned

back east as planned. They carried with them

four boxes and a trunk filled with plant and

rock samples, as well as the captains’ journals

and drawings. ~~_Here, the word_~~ ~~trunk~~ ~~_means a_~~





~~_large, strong box used for holding things._~~ They

also took with them some living animals, such



as a magpie and a prairie dog. ~~_A magpie is a black and white bird that makes_~~

~~_a lot of noise._~~ Lewis told Clark, “I wish I could see President Jefferson’s

face when that magpie starts chattering away. The president will be mighty

pleased; and he will be delighted with all the information in our journals

and drawings.”


Clark replied, “He will be even happier when you and I report to him in person

that we have reached the Pacific.” ~~_What was the last task they still had to_~~

The word _trunk_ also
means an elephant’s nose

**Show Image 9A-1: Parting ways**

After Lewis and Clark sent some of the team

back east with reports and scientific samples

for President Jefferson, the captains and the

rest of their crew continued west. They rode

in two of their original pirogues plus six new





canoes made from hollowed-out trees. These

canoes, about thirty feet long and three feet



wide, were hard to balance. More than once, as the men were getting used

to them, the canoes **overturned** in mid-river, forcing the men to fish out wet

supplies before going on. ~~_The men had to get the supplies out of the water_~~

~~_because the boats flipped over in the water and the supplies fell out._~~ Despite

this, Lewis wrote in his journal that the men were happy and healthy.


**Show Image 9A-2: Missouri River lined with**

Soon they left behind the flat plains and

entered hilly land. Now, the Missouri River

became more difficult to travel. Forests of

Native Americans of the area that some Native Americans called themselves

“the people of the red cedar,” performing special ceremonies before

chopping down the huge evergreens. ~~_Evergreen trees stay green all year long._~~


**Show Image 9A-3: Men gathered around a**

**red cedar to show size**

Lewis and Clark knew it would be impossible

to take an entire tree back with them because

of its gigantic size, almost 200 feet above the

ground. That’s as tall as a twenty-story building!





Nevertheless, the tree was so important to the

lives of Native Americans that they knew they



must gather samples and **record** its many uses. ~~_They knew they had to write_~~

~~_down information about the tree’s many uses in order to remember and share it._~~

They drew pictures and collected branches, cones, and seeds.


As they learned more about the western red cedar from the Native Americans

in the area, both Lewis and Clark wrote about the importance of the western

red cedar in their journals. The people and animals of the northwest relied

upon the tree for their existence ~~_or in order to survive_~~ . Native Americans used

the bark of the tree to weave mats, baskets, and clothing, and used the wood

to build canoes. Elk ate the leaves and shoots of the enormous tree. Bears

hibernated, or slept through the winter, in hollow cedar logs.


**Show Image 9A-4: Grizzly bear and eastern**

**black bear**

The men heard often of the bears called grizzly

bears that made their homes in the hollowed
out logs of the cedars, so as they made their

way up the Missouri, William Clark warned,





“Keep a sharp eye out for grizzly bears.” ~~_[Point_~~

~~_to the grizzly bear in the picture.] What do you_~~



~~_think Clark means when he says, “Keep a sharp eye out for grizzly bears?”_~~ ~~(Be~~

~~very aware and alert in case a grizzly bear is near.)~~


One of the hunters said, “Don’t worry, Captain, we’ve seen plenty of bears

before, back in Kentucky.”


“Black bears, yes; grizzly bears, no. From what I hear, it’s like the difference

between a house cat and a lion.” ~~_Does Captain Clark think that grizzly bears_~~

~~_are like black bears?_~~


Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


**Show Image 9A-5: Meeting grizzlies**

One day, Lewis and another man were out

hunting along the riverbank. Suddenly they

saw two giant grizzly bears up ahead. The

bears rose up on their hind legs—up and up—

until they stood _eight feet tall_ ! Then, roaring,

the bears charged. Raising their rifles and

taking careful aim, Lewis and his companion



~~_or friend_~~ shot one bear, but the other one kept coming right at them with

frightening speed. “Run!” shouted Lewis, and the two men turned and ran for

their lives!


Lewis and the other man stopped running to take another shot, turned, took

aim, and fired at the same instant. The loud “bang” was followed by a tense

moment as the bear suddenly stopped running. It held still for a moment,

and then it toppled over ~~_or fell forward_~~ .


**Show Image 9A-6: Writing about the grizzly**

**bear encounter**

Only when they were sure that the grizzly

bear was dead did Lewis and his companion

carefully approach the animal. Lewis later

wrote in his journal that the bear weighed





between five hundred and six hundred pounds,

and was eight and a half feet tall. That’s taller

After this frightening chase, Lewis told the whole party, “From now on, we

must always move about, and do even the simplest actions, in parties ~~_or_~~

stand a chance.”

_is an evergreen tree.)_


   - **Inferential.** Could Lewis and Clark bring a red cedar back with them? ( _no_ )
Why not? _(It was too big.)_ What did they decide to do instead? ( _Instead,_
_they decided to draw pictures and collect cones and branches._ )


**Show Image 9A-4: Grizzly bear and eastern black bear**


2. **Evaluative.** What was the animal that Lewis and Clark discovered?

[Students should point to the grizzly bear.] How are the grizzly bear and the
black bear the same? _(They are both bears that live in the wild.)_ How are they
different? _(The black bear is smaller and black. The grizzly bear is brown and_
_much bigger. Also, Clark explained that he thought the grizzly bear was much_
_more dangerous and wild than the black bear.)_


3. **Inferential.** Why did Lewis tell the group they must do things in parties of
two or more? _(They should do things in parties of two or more because of the_
_danger of grizzly bears.)_

The Corps of Discovery had now been on

their journey for over a year. ~~_Can you imagine_~~

~~_traveling and being away from home for a_~~

~~_year?_~~ The explorers were very good friends





with one another and had learned to depend

on one another. One day, John Shields and



**134**



George Shannon went ahead of the others in a pirogue. John Shields was

the blacksmith, and he knew his way around outdoors. George Shannon was

smart and friendly.


Shields and Shannon paddled up the river, talking over the exciting events

they had gone through so far. ~~_Which events do you think they were talking_~~

~~_about?_~~ “Well,” Private Shannon said, “no one can complain that it has been

**dull** .” ~~Dull~~ ~~_means boring. No one can say that this expedition has been boring,_~~

Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


**Show Image 10A-2: A fork in the river**

No sooner were those words out of his

mouth than the tip of their pirogue came

around a bend in the river, and they saw a

sight that caused them to stop paddling for

a moment. Up ahead, the Missouri River split

into two wide rivers. One of the two rivers

was the Missouri, and the other was not. It



was impossible to tell which one was the Missouri River. “Which river is the

Missouri?” Shannon asked. “The Missouri River is the one the captains think

can carry us farther west.”


“I don’t know,” Shields replied, “and I don’t think the captains will know either.


“We’ve passed the part of the river our Native American friends told us

about, and none of us has seen this part of the country before.”


Soon the other boats arrived. Going ashore, Lewis and Clark walked ahead and

inspected the two rivers. Clark said, “If we take the wrong river, it may turn too

cold for us to travel by the time we are ready to start from here again.”


**Show Image 10A-3: Map of Lewis and Clark’s**
**journey so far** ~~_[Point out that Lewis and Clark’s_~~

~~_path so far is shown in red.]_~~

Native Americans told them that the Missouri

River ended in the Rocky Mountains. Lewis

and Clark knew that they would have to

travel by land instead of by water to cross the

mountains. Because they wouldn’t be able to

cross the mountains on a river, that meant there was no all-water route to

the Pacific Ocean.


Check for Understanding


**Use Evidence:** Which one of the three tasks will Lewis and Clark
not be able to accomplish? _(find an all-water route to the Pacific_
_Ocean)_ Why? _(There isn’t one; an all-water route to the Pacific_
_Ocean doesn’t exist.)_



Support


Explain that the problem
the group faced was
that they were not sure
which river was the
Missouri River.

Be sure students
understand that Lewis
found out there was no
all-water route to the
Pacific Ocean.

“We need to find the Shoshone people up ahead, so we can buy horses

from them,” they agreed. ~~_[Remind students that Sacagawea was Shoshone.]_~~

But first they would have to continue along the Missouri River to the Rocky

Mountains.


**Show Image 10A-4: Going exploring**

Lewis suggested, “The last Native Americans

we talked to said that there was a huge

**waterfall** up ahead on the Missouri River.

~~_[Explain to students that a waterfall is a place_~~

~~_where a river falls down from a high point.]_~~ We





need to find that waterfall. Take some men

north. ~~_The fork is where the river split into two rivers._~~ If one of us finds it, that

person will know he is on the correct river. We’ll meet back here in a few days

to see which group has found the waterfall.” ~~_Who do you think will find the_~~

~~_waterfall: Lewis or Clark?_~~


Unfortunately when they met back up after a few days, neither group had

found the waterfall. Lewis had another idea. He decided to try looking for the

waterfall by land, rather than following one of the two rivers.


**Show Image 10A-5: Waterfall** ~~_[Point to the_~~

~~_waterfall.]_~~

Lewis and his men walked for two days before

they heard what Lewis later described as “the

agreeable sound of falling water.” Following

the sound, they came to not just one waterfall,





but a whole series of great waterfalls. This

was it! They could now figure out which of the



two rivers was the Missouri River. Lewis sent a man back for the rest of the

party. When Clark and the rest arrived at the great waterfalls, however, they

found Lewis and his men burying the keelboat and some of their supplies for

the trip back. “It’s too heavy,” Lewis explained. “We need to carry the boats

around the waterfalls in order to continue up the Missouri River.”


Finally, after eleven days of hard work, they left the great waterfalls behind.

It was a difficult journey. The river was becoming harder to follow as it

narrowed and filled with rocks.


Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


**Show Image 10A-6: Sacagawea guiding the**

**party**

On the other hand, Sacagawea was closer

to the area where she had lived with the

Shoshone. She was now able to guide the

Corps of Discovery better, because she started

to recognize the land where she had lived as

a child. The more places she recognized, the



more **confidently** she guided them. ~~_Sacagawea became more certain of which_~~

~~_way to go as she got closer to the Shoshone lands where she used to live._~~


In August of 1805, Lewis told Clark, “I will take three men ahead on foot,

instead of following this winding river. If we find the Shoshone, we’ll return

with horses. We can use the horses to cross the mountains. Then we can look

for the other river we think flows down from the mountains all the way to the

Pacific Ocean.”


**Show Image 10A-7: Meeting a Shoshone**

A few days later, Lewis and his men were

crossing a meadow when they spied ~~_or saw_~~ a

Shoshone horseman up ahead. Unfortunately,

horseman turned and rode away.


**Show Image 10A-8: Map of Lewis and Clark’s**

**journey so far**

The four men kept looking for the Shoshone.

A few days later, they reached the Rocky

Mountains, which, since the Louisiana

Purchase, formed the western edge of the

United States.



Lesson 10 Rivers and Mountains
**137**


**Show Image 10A-9: Meeting the Shoshone**

**chief**

The next afternoon, they came upon an old

Shoshone woman gathering wood for a fire.

Smiling, Lewis said in English, “We are friends.”

She did not know English, but she understood

when Lewis smiled that he was friendly. She led

the four travelers to her village and introduced



Lewis to the chief. The Shoshone had plenty of horses, but the Shoshone chief

explained with sign language that the Shoshone did not have much food to

share. ~~_Sign language is a way of communicating by using your hands._~~


Two days later, Clark and the rest of the expedition arrived with Sacagawea.


**Show Image 10A-10: Talking with the chief by**

**the fire**

Now Sacagawea could translate the chief’s

words. ~~_When Sacagawea translated, she turned_~~

~~_the chief’s words in the Shoshone language_~~

~~_into English so that Lewis and Clark could_~~





~~_understand what the chief said._~~ Sacagawea

joined Lewis, Clark, and the chief in his cabin.



It was dark; the only light was from the fire. With her help, the chief told the

captains that his people did not know the way to the ocean, but that a river

did run down to it, and that another tribe, the Nez Perce, could lead the party

to the river. As she translated this, Sacagawea suddenly cried out. In the

shadows of the chief’s home, she had not seen his face clearly. Now, as he

turned more toward the light, she recognized him.


The chief was Sacagawea’s brother!


**Show Image 10A-11: Reunion of Sacagawea**

**and her brother**

She threw her arms around him and in a rush

of words explained who she was. What a joyful

surprise this was for everyone! ~~_Sacagawea_~~

~~_and her brother had not seen each other in_~~





~~_many years._~~ In all the Shoshone lands, Lewis

had stumbled into the village of Sacagawea’s

horses, supplies, and guides you will need in order to complete your journey.”

Mountains. _(There is no all-water route to the Pacific Ocean.)_


- Ask students to explain Sacagawea’s role on the expedition and how it
contributes to the success of the expedition thus far. _(Answers may vary,_
_but may include: She served as a translator, helping Lewis and Clark talk_
_with Native American tribes. When she was speaking with the Shoshone_
_on behalf of Lewis and Clark, she realized the chief was her brother. Her_
_brother, the chief, promised to help the Corps of Discovery complete their_
_journey. Without her and the help from her brother, perhaps the Corps of_
_Discovery would not be able to continue on their expedition.)_


- Ask students how they think the expedition would have been different
if they had not had Sacagawea as a guide and translator. _(Answers may_
_vary, but may include: They may have gotten lost. They may not have been_

~~**“TO THE PACIFIC AND BACK” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 11A-1: Advice from the Nez Perce**



The closer Meriwether Lewis, William Clark,
Sacagawea, and their friends came to the
Pacific, the more Native American people
they met. This land was home to many
Native Americans who had lived there in

~~_Communities are groups of people who live_~~
~~_together in the same place._~~





**150**



With the help of the Shoshones and the Nez Perce, the Corps of Discovery
crossed the Rocky Mountains which stood between them and the Pacific
Ocean. A new, powerful river began in these mountains. The captains hoped
to ride it downhill to the ocean. But the Nez Perce warned, “In some places,
this river rushes through narrow rock **canyons**, moving so quickly and
powerfully that it is difficult to control a boat there. ~~_Canyons are steep, rocky_~~
~~_valleys._~~ You could be hurt if your boat hits the canyon walls or the sharp
rocks sticking out of the water.”


**TEKS 1.6.C** Make and correct or confirm predictions using text features, characteristics of genre, and structures with adult
assistance; **TEKS 1.6.G** Evaluate details to determine what is most important with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and texts the student is able to read or hear to learn or clarify word meanings; **TEKS 1.7.F** Respond using newly acquired
vocabulary as appropriate.


Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


**Show Image 11A-2: The assessment**


William Clark and the group’s best canoeist
climbed the rocks to look down at this part of
the river. ~~_A canoeist is someone who paddles_~~
~~_a canoe._~~ They heard the roar of the water
charging through the narrow canyon even
before they saw it. Walking atop the rock rim
high above, Clark asked the canoeist, “What do
you think?”



“Captain,” the canoeist answered, “I expect to play my violin at our next
campsite downriver, after we all get safely through this canyon.” ~~_This means_~~
~~_the canoeist thinks they can make it through the canyon._~~


Clark grinned. “That’s what I wanted to hear. Let us find the others.”


**Show Image 11A-3: Braving the rapids**



The men pushed off from the shore, and the
pirogues and canoes plunged into the rapids.
The mighty **current** ~~_or strong flow of water_~~
pushed and pulled the boats, but working
together, the men steered ~~_or guided the boats_~~

keeping their balance whenever the river
threatened to tip over the boats. Finally they shot out the other end of the
rocky canyon and into calm water. John Shields turned to his young friend,
George Shannon. “What do you think, George?”





Shannon answered, “I was just starting to enjoy myself. Do you think they
have any more of those around here?” Then both men laughed.


Soon afterward, the men landed on an island in the middle of the river just
short of the place where the river emptied into the ocean. There, with the
help of neighboring Native Americans, they survived another long, cold, rainy
winter. At last the weather cleared, and they were able to travel the rest of
the way to the Pacific Ocean.



Support


Explain that the phrase
_just short of_ means right
before or not quite to
something. The men
landed on an island in the
middle of the river right
before the river empties
into the ocean.


Challenge


Ask students to say the
word for the place where
a river empties into
the ocean.



Lesson 11 To the Pacific and Back
**151**


**Show Image 11A-4: Seeing the Pacific Ocean**


There before them was the sight they had
dreamed of seeing: the Pacific Ocean. Some
of the men cheered. Others stood in silent
**contentment** . ~~_This means that they stood_~~
~~_happily and quietly, looking at the Pacific_~~
~~_Ocean._~~



Sacagawea was amazed. She had never seen an ocean, or even a picture of
one. Clark heard that a whale had washed up on a nearby beach and he took
Sacagawea to see it. She told him, “I have traveled a long way with you to see
the great waters, and now I have seen this monstrous whale as well. I am so
happy to see the ocean!” Then she walked along the sand, happily letting the
waves wash over her feet.


**Show Image 11A-5: Returning home**


On March 23, 1806, nearly two years after first
leaving St. Louis, the Corps of Discovery turned
to head for home. They had mapped a great
deal of the Louisiana Territory and beyond,
from the Mississippi River to the Pacific. ~~_This_~~

~~_the areas across which they had traveled._~~ They
now knew how to get to the Pacific: they could take the Missouri River to the
Rockies, cross the Rockies on foot, and then take other rivers to the Pacific
Ocean. They had made friends with many Native Americans. They found out
that no single river ran all the way from the Mississippi to the Pacific. They had
learned about many animals, birds, fish, and insects.





They had more adventures on the journey home, of course, but in the end,
everyone got back safely except for a few who chose not to go back.


**Show Image 11A-6: John Colter in the**
**Mandan village**





John Colter, the man from whom the Teton
Sioux had taken a horse, told Meriwether
Lewis, “Captain, I have had enough of cities
and crowds. I will stay in the west, if you will let
me.” So Colter went to live among the Mandan
people, promising, “I’ll be here when you come
back,” and more than one of his friends did go
back later to visit him.


Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier

**Show Image 11A-7: Saying goodbye to**
**Charbonneau and Sacagawea**



Sacagawea and her husband, Toussaint
Charbonneau, with their little son that
everyone called “Pompey,” went home to the
Shoshone. Lewis and Clark told Sacagawea,

succeeded.” Sacagawea replied, “You showed
me the great waters. We are friends. We helped each other.” Setting off again,
Lewis and Clark watched Sacagawea, with her son in her arms, waving from
the shore until a bend in the river blocked them from sight.





Check for Understanding


**Evaluate an Idea:** Was Lewis and Clark’s expedition a success?
Why or why not? _(Answers may vary, but may include: Yes, even_
_though they didn’t accomplish all the tasks. They tried hard to but_
_one task could not be done by anyone. They learned about plants,_
_animals, landscapes, and Native Americans along the way and_
_shared that information with others.)_


**Show Image 11A-8: Welcome home**





Months later, the travelers reached home.
There they said their goodbyes and went their
various ways, some to more adventures and
some to quieter lives. Perhaps you would like
to know what happened to the four people who
had been most responsible for the journey.



Meriwether Lewis became governor of the entire Louisiana Territory. William
Clark became the governor of Missouri, then spent much of the rest of his life
working with Native Americans on behalf of the government’s newly created
Bureau of Indian Affairs.

_(Answers may vary.)_


1. **Literal.** Did Lewis and Clark reach the Pacific Ocean? _(yes)_

   - **Literal.** Did everyone in the Read-Aloud make it back home safely? _(Yes,_
_everyone who decided to go back home made it back safely; some people_

   - **Inferential.** Which of the tasks were they able to accomplish? _(Lewis and_
_Clark made friends with Native Americans and recorded information about_
_and collected samples of plants and animals.)_ Which of the tasks were they
not able to accomplish? _(Lewis and Clark did not find an all-water route to_
_the Pacific Ocean. They had to go on foot through the Rockies and then sail_
_other rivers to get to the Pacific Ocean.)_

Have students who
are ready write the
informational paragraph
independently.


**156**



**Writing:** With assistance, students will summarize Lewis and Clark’s expedition.


~~**TEKS 1.1.D; TEKS 1.11.E; TEKS 1.12.B**~~


~~**LEWIS AND CLARK’S EXPEDITION**~~


  - Tell students you will review the sequence of events leading up to Lewis and
Clark’s expedition before writing about their journey.


  - Divide students into three groups and give each group an Image Card.


  - Tell students to discuss the Image Card as a group. Then, each group will
describe their Image Card and explain the significance of it leading up to
Lewis and Clark’s expedition.


  - Have groups present information about each Image Card. Use the following
as a reference and support for groups as needed:


    - Image Card 8 (Thomas Jefferson): Jefferson wanted to buy New Orleans
to maintain control of the Mississippi River. He asked James Monroe to
ask Napoleon to sell New Orleans to the United States. Napoleon sold New
Orleans _and_ the Louisiana Territory to the United States. He also chose
Lewis (who then chose Clark as co-captain) to lead an expedition into the
Louisiana Territory.


    - Image Card 9 (The Louisiana Territory): This is the area of land the
United States bought from France, doubling the size of the United States.
Americans had not been to this part of North America. Lewis and Clark led
an expedition through it.


    - Image Card 10 (Lewis and Clark): Lewis was chosen by Jefferson to explore
the Louisiana Territory. Lewis chose Clark as his co-captain. Together with
the Corps of Discovery, they explored the territory. They accomplished two
of the three tasks Jefferson asked them to do.


  - Tell students you will work together to start an informational paragraph
about Lewis and Clark’s expedition. Explain that students will finish the
paragraph with a partner, and do so using digital tools.


**TEKS 1.1.D** Work collaboratively with others by following agreed-upon rules for discussion, including listening to others,
speaking when recognized, and making appropriate contribution; **TEKS 1.11.E** Publish and share writing; **TEKS 1.12.B** Dictate
or compose informational texts, including procedural texts.


Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


- Explain that the paragraph should give a summary of Lewis and Clark’s
expedition. Explain that a summary is a way to use fewer words to share the
most important information about something rather than telling every detail.


- Explain that the paragraph should begin with a sentence that gives an idea
about the topic. Engage students in a brief discussion about how to start the
paragraph.


- Write the first sentence on the board or chart paper. For example, you may
wish to start the paragraph with the following:


  - Lewis and Clark explored the Louisiana Territory.


- Next, direct students’ attention to the Three Tasks Chart and hand back
Activity Page 7.1.


- Read the information on the chart aloud as students follow along on their
own charts.


- Tell students to use the information on the chart and on Activity Page 7.1 to
finish writing the paragraph with their partner, using available digital tools.


- Also, tell students to think about how to describe the tasks Lewis and Clark
accomplished, or didn’t, and whether or not the expedition was successful.


- Pair students to write/type. Circulate around the room, offering guidance
and support as needed.


- Have student pairs share their paragraphs with other pairs or with the
entire class.

#### Unit Assessment


This unit assessment evaluates each student’s retention of the unit and
academic vocabulary words and the core content targeted in _Heading West:_
_Exploring the Frontier_ . The results should guide review and remediation the
following days.


There are three parts to this assessment. You may choose to do the
parts in more than one sitting if you feel this is more appropriate for your
students. Part I (vocabulary assessment) is divided into two sections: the
first assesses unit-related vocabulary and the second assesses academic
vocabulary. Parts II and III of the assessment address the core content
targeted in _Heading West: Exploring the Frontier_ .

those people.


 - Then, have them write letters to that person or those people using their lists
of questions as starting points.


**Sign Language**

 - Remind students that often the Native American tribes and Lewis and Clark
used sign language to communicate since they didn’t know the same spoken
language.


 - In pairs, have students try to communicate with each other without talking,
using only signs they can make with their hands, arms, facial expressions,
etc.


 - Discuss with students the difficulties this may have presented.


**Class Book: Heading West: Exploring the Frontier**


Materials: paper, drawing tools

 - Tell the class or a group of students that they are going to make a class book

Unit 9 Heading West: Exploring the Frontier


**Using a Map**


Materials: U.S. map

  - Use a map of the United States to review various locations from the ReadAlouds. Ask questions such as the following:


    - Daniel Boone was one of the settlers who wanted to move west. Which
mountain range was a barrier to moving west?


    - Which city did President Jefferson want to buy from France?


    - Which river was important for trade and access to the ocean?

  - Have them brainstorm new ways that Lewis and Clark could have reached
the Pacific Ocean.


**Sayings and Phrases: “If at First You Don’t Succeed, Try, Try Again”**


**Note:** Proverbs are short, traditional sayings that have been passed along
orally from generation to generation. These sayings usually express general
truths based on experiences and observations of everyday life. While some
proverbs do have literal meanings—that is, they mean exactly what they
say—many proverbs have a richer meaning beyond the literal level. It is
important to help your students understand the difference between the
literal meanings of the words and their implied, or figurative, meanings.


  - Ask students if they have ever heard the saying “if at first you don’t succeed,
try, try again.”


  - Explain to students that the saying means that you shouldn’t stop trying even
if you fail at something the first time.


  - Have students repeat the saying after you.


  - Explain to students that in one of the Read-Alouds, they heard about the
problems Lewis and Clark encountered when the river divided into two parts
and they had to figure out which river to continue following. They knew that
the correct river would have a waterfall, so they decided to try and find
the waterfall.

 - Explain that first, they tried splitting up and going down each of the two rivers
to find the waterfall, but they did not succeed in finding it.


 - Explain that Lewis and Clark did not give up, though. Share that Lewis and
Clark may have said, “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” They
tried walking over land to find the waterfall, and this time they did find the
waterfall! If Lewis and Clark had given up after their first try, they would never
have found the waterfall.


 - Explain that just because their first try was unsuccessful, Lewis and Clark
did not give up; they tried a second time—and were successful!


 - Have students share experiences in which they failed at something at
first, but then kept trying until they were successful.


**Timeline**


Materials: timeline, Image Cards 1–5, 7–10

 - Remove all the Image Cards from the timeline.


 - Give each Image Card to student pairs or small groups of students.


 - Have each pair/small group discuss their Image Card and be ready to explain
it to the class.


 - Have each pair/small group describe their Image Card to the class and place
it on the timeline in the appropriate place.


 - When all Image Cards have been placed, review the sequence of events and
people on the Image Cards.


 - You may also choose to have students create and/or add additional Image
Cards to add more details to the timeline (e.g., Monroe meeting Napoleon,
Lewis and Clark seeing the Pacific Ocean for the first time)
