#### Introduction


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching the _Fairy_
_Tales_ unit. The Teacher Guide for _Fairy Tales_ contains eleven daily lessons in addition to nine days
for Pausing Points (five days), Unit Review, Unit Assessment, and Culminating Activities (four days)
in the order presented in this Teacher Guide. You should spend no more than twenty days total on
this unit.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


At the back of this Teacher Guide, you will find a section titled “Teacher Resources.” In this section
you will find the following:


  - Sample Completed Charts Elements of Fairy Tales for “Sleeping Beauty”


  - Elements of Fairy Tales for “Rumpelstiltskin”


  - Venn Diagram


  - Elements of Fairy Tales for “Rapunzel”


  - Elements of Fairy Tales for “The Frog Prince”

Introduction
**1**


~~**UNIT COMPONENTS**~~


Along with this Teacher Guide, you will need:


     - Flip Book for _Fairy Tales_, which can also be found on the program’s online materials


     - Image Cards for _Fairy Tales_


     - Activity Book for _Fairy Tales_


     - Digital Components for _Fairy Tales_


All unit components’ materials can also be found in the digital version provided with the online
materials.


~~**WHY FAIRY TALES ARE IMPORTANT**~~


This unit will introduce students to fairy tales that have been favorites with children for generations.
Students will learn about the elements of fairy tales that distinguish them as a unique type of
fiction that still has the elements of character, plot, and setting that are found in other types of
fiction. Reading these fairy tales will help first-grade students develop a strong foundation for the
understanding of other fictional stories in later grades.


This unit also provides opportunities for students to build content knowledge and draw connections
to the social studies subject area. At times throughout the unit, you may wish to build on class
discussions to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of Culture
and Geography from the Social Studies TEKS. This content is not a replacement for grade level
social studies instruction. For more information about the quantitative and qualitative measures
used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher
Resources.


**Note:** These fictional stories have been adapted from the originals and were written more than 200
years ago. Remind students of this context periodically.


Unit 7 Fairy Tales
**2**


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED**~~


The following units, and the specific core content that was targeted in those units, are particularly
relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _Fairy Tales_ . This background knowledge will greatly
enhance your students’ understanding of the Read-Alouds they are about to enjoy:


Nursery Rhymes and Fables (Kindergarten)


Fairy Tales and Folktales (Kindergarten)


Kings and Queens (Kindergarten)


Sharing Stories (Grade 1)


~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR FAIRY TALES**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _Fairy Tales_ in the forms in which they
appear in the Read-Alouds. Boldfaced words in the list have an associated Word Work activity. The
inclusion of the words on this list does not mean that students are immediately expected to be able
to use all of these words on their own. However, through repeated exposure throughout the lessons,
they should acquire a good understanding of most of these words and begin to use some of them in
conversation.

Unit 7 Fairy Tales

~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit, students will explore the genre of narrative writing. They will learn to identify important
elements of fairy tales before, during, and after Read-Alouds. They will practice planning for
narrative writing by note-taking as a group with Elements of Fairy Tales charts, a Venn diagram, and
other organizers. After you model narrative writing, students will independently plan, write, and edit
a narrative retelling of their favorite fairy tale. The following activities may be added to students’
writing portfolios to showcase student writing within and across units:


  - Elements of Fairy Tales charts (all lessons)


  - Venn diagram (Lesson 3)


  - narrative retelling of their favorite fairy tale (Lessons 8–9)


  - Character Maps (Lesson 10)


  - Friendly Letter (Lesson 11)


  - any additional writing completed during the Pausing Point, Unit Review, or Culminating Activities


~~**FOUNDATIONAL ORAL LANGUAGE**~~


The Think-Pair-Share and Turn-and-Talk prompts throughout the unit provide opportunities to teach
and reinforce how to communicate by using conventions of language, speaking when recognized,
and making appropriate contributions to discussion.


  - You can also reinforce these ideas by modeling using an appropriate pace, recognizing students’
individual contributions to group discussions, and pointing out conventions of language.


  - Explain to students that when working in whole/small groups, group members share responsibility
for the work they do together. To work effectively and respectfully, everyone should recognize the
contributions made by each group member. For example, as group members discuss a text, each
group member can share thoughts and reactions. If preparing to return to a whole-group discussion,
group members can summarize the group’s ideas by including contributions from everyone in the
group.


  - Consider using a discussion checklist that tracks student participation, as well as introducing
discussion techniques that enhance participation. ~~**TEKS 1.1.C; TEKS 1.1.D**~~


**TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using the conventions of language;
**TEKS 1.1.D** Work collaboratively with others by following agreed-upon rules for discussion, including listening to others, speaking when recognized, and making
appropriate contributions.

Note to Teacher


You may want to remind students periodically that, more than two hundred
years ago, the Brothers Grimm thought these stories would be interesting
for people to hear because they are about things that make people happy,
sad, and sometimes afraid. It is also important to remind students that the
stories themselves are fiction.


Lesson 1 Sleeping Beauty
**9**


**10**



Please preview all Read-Alouds and lessons in this unit before presenting
them to students.


In this lesson, students will learn the saying “the land of Nod.” This is a short,
traditional saying that has been passed along orally from generation to
generation. Although some sayings and proverbs do have literal meanings—
that is, they mean exactly what they say—many have a richer meaning
beyond the literal level. It is important to help your students understand the
difference between the literal meanings of the words and their implied or
figurative meanings.


**Universal Access**

 - Gather a sketch of the Brothers Grimm and a complete anthology of the
Brothers Grimm.


 - Gather Story Maps and other organizers, including the Somebody Wanted
But So Then chart for “Cinderella” that was created in Unit 3, to remind
students of the elements of stories they have heard already this year.


 - Students who participated in the program in Kindergarten may be familiar
with the process of spinning from their studies of _Colonial Towns and_
_Townspeople_ . You may wish to use the Kindergarten Unit 10 Teacher Guide,
Image Cards, and/or Flip Book review information with students.

Support


If students have trouble
answering these questions
about stories, you may
encourage them to look
back at the story maps
and other organizers you
created in Units 1 and 3.


Support


Peruse the Flip Book
images with students to
look for common fairy tale
characters: princesses,
princes, giants, witches,
and animals that can talk.


**12**




  - Remind students that during previous units they have heard fiction and
nonfiction Read-Alouds.


  - Ask students what the differences are between fiction and nonfiction.
_(Answers may vary.)_


Check for Understanding


**Think and Talk:** What is a story? In other words, what was the
same across all the different tales you’ve heard this year? _(fiction;_
_has characters, a setting, plot, and sometimes a moral or lesson)_


  - Tell students that in this unit they will learn more about a special kind of fiction
story called a fairy tale. Ask students if they have heard of fairy tales before. If they
have, encourage them to share any characteristics they may know of.


  - Show students the blank Elements of Fairy Tales chart you prepared in advance.
Tell students that each of the things they see on the chart is a characteristic of
fairy tales. Explain each of the characteristics. ~~**TEKS 1.8.C; TEKS 1.8.D; TEKS 1.9.A**~~

    - **Setting:** The setting of the story is the place and time in which the story
takes place.

    - **Characters:** In fairy tales, the characters—or people and animals who
are featured in the story—can be both real and magical. Tell students that


**TEKS 1.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and answer questions using multi-word responses;
**TEKS 1.8.C** Describe plot elements including the main events, the problem, and the resolution, for texts read aloud and
independently; **TEKS 1.8.D** Describe the setting; **TEKS 1.9.A** Demonstrate knowledge of distinguishing characteristics of
well-known children’s literature such as folktales, fables, fairy tales, and nursery rhymes.


Unit 7 Fairy Tales


in this unit, they will hear tales about characters including princesses,
princes, giants, witches, and even animals that can talk. Explain that
although some of the things that happen in fairy tales could happen in
their own lives, many of the things that happen in these stories are fantasy,
or a kind of make-believe that can’t really happen.

   - **Fantasy:** All tales have a plot, but fairy tales often have imaginary or
magical events, also known as elements of fantasy—things that couldn’t
happen in real life.


   - **Problems and Solutions:** In fairy tales, the characters often face some
sort of problem, which is solved by the end of the story. Tell students they
will learn how characters’ problems are often solved in fairy tales and that
they will have a chance to compare fairy tales to see how they are alike
and different.


   - **Ending:** Fairy tales always end happily.


 - Ask students if they have any questions about the elements of fairy tales.


 - Tell students that they have already heard a fairy tale this year: “Cinderella.”


 - Ask students to recall this story from Unit 3. You may use the Somebody
Wanted But So Then chart the class created about that story to help
students recall important parts.


 - Using the Elements of Fairy Tales chart, show students how each of the
elements of fairy tales was fulfilled in “Cinderella.”


~~**UNIT INTRODUCTION (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students they will hear more fairy tales in this unit.


 - Explain that many fairy tales, including the one they’ll hear today, were
collected long ago by two brothers named Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm. They
are often called the Brothers Grimm.


 - Point to Germany on a world map, and tell students that the brothers lived
in a place now called Germany, and many of the stories that we now know as
fairy tales had been told orally for many years in their country and in other
countries, too. The brothers decided to write the stories down and make a
book out of them.


 - Tell students they may have heard some of these fairy tales before, but some
may be completely new to them.

~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION OR TERMS (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that in today’s fairy tale, and in another fairy tale they will hear
later, they will hear about spinning wheels.


 - Show students Image Card 1 (Spinning Wheel), and tell them that spinning
wheels are tools used to spin thread and yarn. Point out the spindle, the
stick-like tool on the spinning wheel where the thread or yarn goes after it
is spun.


 - Explain that people use parts of certain plants, such as cotton and flax, wool
from animals like sheep and alpacas, and even hair from certain goats and
rabbits to make thread or yarn.


 - Show students pieces of thread and yarn, and explain that these are made
by spinning—or tightly twisting—the plant fibers, wool, or hair around and
around until they form a long piece. You may wish to unravel the piece of
yarn to show that there are thinner pieces twisted together. Explain that
many even smaller pieces are spun together to make each of these sections
of yarn.


 - Tell students that most thread and yarn is made by machines in factories
today, but some people still use spinning wheels to make their own thread
or yarn.

~~**“SLEEPING BEAUTY” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show image 1A-1: King with list**

Once upon a time there lived a king and queen

who for many years were very sad because

they had no child. At last a little daughter was

born to them, and the king was so happy that

he planned a great feast in the palace, to which





he would invite all of his friends and relatives.

~~_A feast is a big, fancy meal. People sometimes_~~

~~_do you think is on the list the king is carrying in this image?_~~


Now in his country there were thirteen fairies. Of course the king wished to

invite all of the fairies to the feast too, so that each might look kindly upon

his child, and perhaps give the baby a special fairy gift. But as the king had

only twelve gold plates for the fairies to eat from, it was decided that one

fairy had to be left out. ~~_How do you think the thirteenth fairy will feel about_~~

~~_not being invited to the feast?_~~

**Show image 1A-2: Feast** ~~_Let’s count the_~~

~~_number of fairies we see at the feast._~~ ~~(12)~~

The feast was held, and what a wonderful

celebration it was. As it drew to an end, the

fairies came forward to give the child their

special gifts. One said to the child, “I give you

the gift of **virtue**, so that you may be good.”

Another said, “I give you the gift of **wisdom**, so



that you may be wise.” ~~Virtue~~ ~~_is another word for goodness, and_~~ ~~wisdom~~ ~~_is the_~~

~~_ability to know what is right and to make good choices._~~


A third fairy gave the child the gift of beauty. A fourth gave her riches. And on

it went, with each fairy giving everything in the world that one could wish for.


**Show image 1A-3: Evil fairy**

Eleven of the fairies had given their gifts, and

the twelfth was just about to speak when

suddenly, in came the thirteenth fairy—the

one who had been left out. She was very angry,

and she cried out in a loud voice, “When the





princess is fifteen years of age, she shall **prick**

herself with a spindle and die!” ~~Prick~~ ~~_means to_~~

**Show image 1A-4: Good fairy softening curse**

Without another word, the angry fairy left the

hall. Everyone was terrified at what she had

said. Then the twelfth fairy came forward and

said, “I cannot undo the evil **spell**, but I can

soften it. Here, then, is my gift to the child.





The princess shall not die, but she will fall into

a deep sleep for a hundred years.” ~~_So how did_~~

~~_the twelfth fairy soften the spell?_~~



The king was determined to protect his child. “Surely,” he said, “my daughter

cannot prick herself with a spindle if she never sees one.” So he gave an order

that every spindle in the kingdom should be burned. ~~_Why does the king want_~~

~~_all of the spindles in the kingdom burned?_~~


Unit 7 Fairy Tales


**Show image 1A-5: Princess explores castle**

The princess grew up, and all the fairies’ gifts

to the child were plain to see: she was good,

wise, kind, and beautiful. Everyone who saw

her loved her.


On the day that she turned fifteen, the

king and queen were away from the palace.

The princess was left on her own, and she



wandered about the palace, looking into all sorts of places, and peeking into

rooms that she had never explored before. She climbed a narrow winding

stair that led to a little door with a rusty key sticking out of the lock. She

turned the key, and the door opened, and there in a little room sat an old

woman with a spinning wheel, busily spinning away. ~~_What do you think is_~~

~~_going to happen?_~~


**Show image 1A-6: Princess meets an old**
**woman spinning**

“Good day,” said the princess, entering the

room. “What are you doing?” she asked, for

she had never seen a spinning wheel before.





Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** Why has the princess never seen a spinning
wheel before? _(The spell warned she would be pricked by one, so_
_her father had them all burned in an attempt to protect her.)_


“I am spinning,” said the old woman.


The princess stretched forth her hand and asked, “What is this thing that

spins around so merrily?” But hardly had she spoken when she pricked her

finger on the spinning wheel’s spindle, and in that very moment she fell into a

deep sleep. ~~_Why has the princess fallen asleep?_~~

**Show image 1A-7: Thorns growing up around**

**the sleeping castle**

At the same time, sleep fell upon everyone

in the palace. ~~_[Point to the milkmaid in_~~

~~_the picture.] There is a milkmaid. Do you_~~

~~_remember (from_~~ ~~Fables and Stories~~ ~~_) what a_~~

~~_milkmaid does?_~~ The king and queen, who had

just come home and were in the great hall, fell



fast asleep. The horses in their stalls, the dogs in the yard, the pigeons on

the roof, and the flies on the wall—all fell asleep. Even the fire on the hearth

went out, the wind stopped, and not a leaf fell from the trees. ~~_A hearth is the_~~

~~_bottom of fireplace, where the wood is put._~~


In time, a hedge of thorns began to grow around the castle, which grew

thicker and higher every year, until at last nothing could be seen of the castle,

not even the flags on the highest towers.


**Show image 1A-8: Sleeping Beauty sleeping**

As the years passed, stories spread

throughout the land of a beautiful princess

sleeping behind a wall of thorns. Many a young

prince came, but none could break through

the thorns. But at long last, after many, many





years, there came into the country a king’s

son who heard an old man tell that there was



a castle standing behind the hedge of thorns, and that there a beautiful

**enchanted** princess lay sleeping. ~~_When something is enchanted, it is under_~~

~~_a magic spell. When is the princess’s enchantment supposed to end?_~~ The

prince said, “I shall make my way through and see the lovely princess.” The

old man warned him that many had tried and failed, but the prince would not

listen.


**Show image 1A-9: Prince approaches**

**the castle**

Now the hundred years were at an end, and

the day had come for the sleeping princess to

be awakened. When the prince drew near the

hedge of thorns, it changed into a hedge of





beautiful flowers, which bent aside to let him

pass. When he reached the castle yard, he saw

**18**


the horses and dogs lying asleep, and on the roof the pigeons were sitting

with their heads under their wings. As he entered the castle and climbed the

steps, the prince saw everyone still asleep—the king, the queen, the cook,

the maids, everyone. All was so quiet that he could hear his own breathing.


**Show image 1A-10: Prince awakens**

**the princess**

At last the prince went up the narrow winding

stair and came to the room where the princess

was sleeping. When he saw her looking so

lovely in her sleep, he could not turn his eyes





away. He bent down and kissed her, and she

opened her eyes and smiled at him. Together



they went down the stairs, and they saw the king and queen waking up, and

all the people in the castle waking up and looking at each other in great

surprise. The horses in the yard got up and shook themselves. The dogs

sprang up and wagged their tails. The pigeons on the roof flew into the fields.

The flies on the wall buzzed and crept a little farther. Even the kitchen fire

leapt up and blazed.


At last the wedding of the prince and princess was held with great feasting

and rejoicing, and they lived happily together for the rest of their days.

~~_Rejoicing is a time of happiness and celebration._~~

  - Ask students if they’ve ever gotten so tired that they start to fall asleep while
sitting up, and their head bends or dips down for a moment. Explain that
when your head dips down while falling asleep, it is called a nod. You may
wish to demonstrate what it looks like when someone nods off to sleep or
have students pretend to nod off to sleep at their desks.


  - Ask students how long the princess in “Sleeping Beauty” was in “the land of
Nod” and what they think she might have been most excited to see when she
finally woke up and returned from “the land of Nod.”


  - Tell students they might say that they are entering “the land of Nod” just as
they are falling asleep at night. Ask students if they can think of other times
they might use this saying.

~~**ELEMENTS OF FAIRY TALES CHART (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Display the blank Elements of Fairy Tales chart for “Sleeping Beauty.” Tell
students that just as they worked together to fill out a chart like this for
“Cinderella,” they will fill one out for “Sleeping Beauty” to see why it is
considered a fairy tale. ~~**TEKS 1.8.C; TEKS 1.8.D; TEKS 1.9.A**~~


**Setting**

  - Remind students that the setting of a story is the time and place a story
takes place. Ask students where the story takes place _(king’s castle)_, and
record that information on the chart.


  - Tell students that many fairy tales begin in a special way that gives us a clue
about when the story takes place. Ask students to listen carefully while you
reread the first sentence of “Sleeping Beauty.” Ask students if any of the
words in the sentence give them a clue about when the story takes place. Tell
students that the phrase _once upon a time_ often begins fairy tales, and ask
them when they think a tale takes place if it starts with “once upon a time.” _(a_
_long time ago)_ Write the phrase on the chart as well.


**Characters**

  - Next, explain that fairy tales are often about princesses, princes, queens, or
kings. Tell students that people with these titles are called royalty, and remind
them of kings and queens they may have studied in other units. Remind
students that although all characters in fictional stories, such as fairy tales,
are make-believe, most of the characters in “Sleeping Beauty” are based on
real kinds of people. For example, there really are kings, queens, princesses
and princes in our world.


  - Tell students that some characters in fairy tales, such as the fairies in
“Sleeping Beauty,” are magical characters who could not be real people.
Explain that fairy tales usually have one or more magical characters. Tell
students that they will learn about additional fairy tale characters in other
tales they’ll hear.


**Fantasy (Events)**

  - Tell students that many fairy tales also have some things happen that are
magic or fantasy, and ask students to describe the magical events _(the_
_fairies’ gifts to the young princess; the evil and good spells; and the sleeping_
_enchantment)_ that occur in this tale. Record this information on the
“Fantasy” row of the chart. Explain that magical events are one of the things
that make fairy tales different from other kinds of stories.


**TEKS 1.8.C** Describe plot elements including the main events, the problem, and the resolution, for texts read aloud and
independently; **TEKS 1.8.D** Describe the setting; **TEKS 1.9.A** Demonstrate knowledge of distinguishing characteristics of
well-known children’s literature such as folktales, fables, fairy tales, and nursery rhymes.


Unit 7 Fairy Tales


**Problems and Solutions**

  - Ask students to describe the problem the royal family faces in “Sleeping
Beauty” _(the thirteenth fairy’s evil spell)_ and how the problem is solved.
_(the twelfth fairy softens the curse; the king orders that all spindles should_
_be burned; the prince kisses the princess and she awakens)_ Record this
information on the “Problems” and “Solutions” rows of the chart. Tell
students that characters in fairy tales always have a problem that must
be solved.


**Ending**

  - Finally, remind students of their discussion of the ending of “Sleeping
Beauty.” Reread the last sentence of the fairy tale: “At last the wedding of
the prince and princess was held with great feasting and rejoicing, and
they lived happily together for the rest of their days.” Explain to students
that characters in fairy tales almost always live “happily ever after,” and tell
students that the fact that most fairy tales have happy endings is another
thing that makes fairy tales unique.


  - Tell students that they will get a chance to read many more fairy tales and
that they will look at similarities and differences among fairy tales.

On a piece of paper, have students write a sentence about the
setting of “Sleeping Beauty.”

**Language:** Students will demonstrate understanding of the Tier 2 word _succeed_ .


~~**TEKS 1.3.B**~~


~~**PURPOSE FOR LISTENING**~~


  - Ask students what object Sleeping Beauty pricked her finger on in the last
Read-Aloud. _(spinning wheel’s spindle)_


**Show Image Card 1 (Spinning Wheel)**

  - Remind students that spinning wheels are tools used to spin thread and yarn.


  - Tell students that in today’s Read-Aloud a spinning wheel is again part of a
problem for the main character, but in a different way. Tell students to listen
carefully for what a spinning wheel has to do with a character’s problem, and
what the solution is. (If some students are already familiar with this fairy tale,
tell them to listen to see how this version might be different from the one
they know.)


~~**“RUMPELSTILTSKIN” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 2A-1: Miller before the king**

Once upon a time, there was a poor miller who

had a beautiful daughter. She was so beautiful

and **clever** that he could not help **boasting**

about her. ~~_A miller is a person who grinds grain_~~

~~_to make flour. This miller boasts, or speaks_~~



Image Card 1





~~_very proudly, about his daughter, saying she’s_~~

~~_clever. This means she is smart and able to_~~

~~_figure things out quickly._~~



One day, the miller happened to come before the king, and to impress the

king, he began boasting about his daughter. And before he knew it, he found

himself saying that his daughter was so amazing and so wonderful, why, she

could even spin gold out of straw!


**TEKS 1.6.G** Evaluate details to determine what is most important with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.8.B** Describe the main
character(s) and the reason(s) for their actions; **TEKS 1.8.C** Describe plot elements including the main events, the problem,
and the resolution, for texts read aloud and independently; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and texts the student is able to read
or hear to learn or clarify word meanings.


Lesson 2 Rumpelstiltskin
**31**


“That,” said the king, “is a talent worth having. Bring your daughter to me,

and let us see what she can do.” ~~_Remember, thread and yarn are made by_~~

~~_spinning plant parts or animals’ wool. Do you think the daughter can really_~~

~~_spin gold out of straw?_~~


**Show Image 2A-2: Girl being shown to a**

**straw-filled room**

When the girl was brought to the palace, the

king led her to a room that was almost full of

straw. He pointed to a spinning wheel and said,

“Get to work. You must spin this straw into





gold by early morning . . . or else!”



The poor miller’s daughter. Of course she could not spin straw into gold!

What could she do? She could think of nothing, and in the end she sat down

and began to cry. ~~_What do you think she should do?_~~


**Show Image 2A-3: Rumpelstiltskin appears**

And that’s when, all of a sudden, _ka-lick_, the

door opened, and in walked a little man. “Good

evening, miller’s daughter,” he said. “Why are

you crying?”





“Because,” she answered, “I must spin all this

straw into gold before morning, and I don’t know

how.” ~~_Do you think she found it strange to see this_~~

~~_little man in the castle? Where did he come from?_~~



**32**



Then the little man came close to her and whispered, “What will you give me

if I spin it for you?”


“Why, I, I’ll give you my necklace,” she stammered.


Unit 7 Fairy Tales


**Show Image 2A-4: Rumpelstiltskin spinning**

The little man took the necklace, stood at the

spinning wheel, and _whirr, whirr, whirr_, he spun

and he spun, and by sunup all the straw had

been spun into gold. When the king arrived

at sunrise, he was amazed. But the sight of

all that gold made the greed for more grow in

him. ~~_What does it mean for someone to feel_~~

~~_greed?_~~



So the king took the miller’s daughter to a larger room, filled with yet more

straw, and told her that she must spin all this into gold in one night. Again

the girl did not know what to do and sat down to cry, when, _ka-lick_, the door

opened and in walked the little man.


**Show Image 2A-5: Girl giving up her ring**

“Crying again, I see,” he said. “So, I suppose

you have to spin all this into gold, too. What

will you give me if I do it for you?”


“The ring from my finger,” answered the girl.





So the little man took the ring, stood at the

spinning wheel, and _whirr, whirr, whirr_, he spun

and he spun, and by sunup all the straw had been spun into gold. When the

king arrived, he was overjoyed at the sight, but hungry for still more gold.

So he took the miller’s daughter to an even larger room filled with straw and

said, “Spin all this in one night, and if you **succeed** —well then, you shall be

my wife.” ~~_To succeed is to do well or reach a goal. Do you think the daughter_~~

~~_will succeed in meeting the king’s demand?_~~


**Show Image 2A-6: Rumpelstiltskin demands**

**the girl’s first-born child**

The king had hardly left the room when,

_ka-lick_, the door opened and in came the little

man asking, “What will you give me if I spin all

this straw for you one more time?”

“I have nothing left to give,” the girl answered sadly.


“Then promise me this,” said the little man. “Promise me that when you are

queen, you will give me your first child.”


The miller’s daughter thought there was really very little chance that she

would ever be queen, and so she promised, and the little man set to work at

once. ~~_Do you think the daughter’s promise will cause any problems for her_~~

~~_later?_~~ By morning the gold was piled so high that it reached the ceiling. When

the king arrived, he was pleased to see all the gold he wanted. He married the

miller’s daughter and made her queen.


**Show Image 2A-7: Rumpelstiltskin comes to**

**claim the queen’s baby**

In a year’s time the king and queen had a fine

little baby. She thought no more about the

little man or her promise to him. Then one day,

as she sat alone in her room rocking her baby,





_ka-lick_, the door opened, and in walked the

little man who said, “Now it is time for you to

give me what you promised me.”



The queen, filled with fear, held her baby tightly. “Please,” she said, “I will give

you all the riches of the kingdom, only leave me my child.” But the little man

said, “No, I would rather have a living being than all the treasures in the world.”

Then the queen began to weep and wail, and the little man felt **pity** for her. ~~_Pity_~~

~~_is a feeling of sadness for someone who is unhappy._~~ “Okay, okay, I will give you

this one chance,” he said. “In three days, if you can guess my name, then you

may keep your child.” And then he was gone as quickly as he had come.


**Show Image 2A-8: Queen thinking and**

**sending out messengers**

The queen lay awake all night thinking of all

the names she had ever heard. She sent a

messenger to ride through the land and collect

all the names that could be found. And when





the little man came the next day, she tried all

that she had been able to think of: Alexander,



Balthazar, Casper, Doolittle, Eggleston, Ferdinand, and many more. But after

each, the little man only said, “That is not my name.”


Unit 7 Fairy Tales


**Show Image 2A-9: Queen guessing**

The next day the queen sent servants all

around the kingdom to find the most unusual

names, and when the little man came, she

tried them. “Are you called Sheepshanks?

Roast-Ribs? Snickerdoodle? Groucho?

Winklehopper?” But after each, the little man

only said, “That is not my name.” ~~_What do you_~~

~~_think the man’s name might be?_~~


**Show Image 2A-10: Rumpelstiltskin by**

**the fire**

On the third and last day, the queen was worried

sick. She held her child tight and wondered

what to do, when _ka-lick_, the door opened

and in walked—no, not the little man, but the

messenger the queen had sent in search of

names. He bowed to the queen and said, “My



lady, as I passed through the woods last night, I came to a high hill, and near it

was a little house, and outside the house a fire was burning, and around the fire

danced a funny little man, and as he hopped up and down he sang:


_“Today I brew, tomorrow I bake,_
_And then the fair queen’s child I’ll take._
_And no one can deny my_ **claim** _,_
_For Rumpelstiltskin is my name.”_ ~~_A claim is a statement that something_~~
~~_is yours. What is the man’s claim?_~~


**Show Image 2A-11: Queen guessing**

**successfully**

The messenger left, and almost as soon as

he had gone the little man arrived. The queen

greeted him by asking, “Is your name Jack?”





“That is not my name.”


“Then are you called Harry?”



Lesson 2 Rumpelstiltskin
**35**


**36**



“That is not my name.”


“Then perhaps,” said the queen, “your name is—Rumpelstiltskin!”


“No! No! Who told you that?” cried the little man. And in his anger, he

stamped with his right foot so hard that it went into the ground right up to

his waist. Then he stamped his other foot, and he went deep into the ground

way over his head. And the queen and her child never feared him again.


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. Literal. What talent does the father boast that his clever daughter has at the
beginning of this fairy tale? ( _the ability to spin gold from straw_ )

   - Literal. What problem does the miller’s boasting make for his daughter?
( _The king says she has to spin gold for him “or else.”_ )


   - Literal. What does the daughter promise the little man each night he
spins gold for her? ( _her necklace, her ring, and her first child_ )


   - Evaluative. Do you think the daughter made a good decision to promise
her first child to the little man? ( _Answers may vary._ )


2. Literal. When the little man goes to see the queen to make his claim for the
child, the queen starts to cry and he feels pity for her. He then gives her a
chance to get out of her promise. What does the queen have to do in order to
keep her child? ( _guess the little man’s name in three days_ )

   - Evaluative. How does this fairy tale end? ( _The queen guesses_
_Rumpelstiltskin’s name, and he is so angry that he stomps himself into the_
_ground._ ) Is it a happy ending for the queen? ( _yes_ )


3. Evaluative. _Think-Pair-Share:_ What lessons or morals can we learn from
this fairy tale? ( _Answers may vary. Students may say that it isn’t a good idea_
_to boast about a talent that someone doesn’t have; a person should be very_
_careful about the promises they make._ )


4. Evaluative. _Think-Pair-Share:_ [Show students Flip Book images of the
characters in this Read-Aloud.] Think about the characters you heard
about in the Read-Aloud today. Pick one character to focus on. Your partner
will pick a different character. Describe your character to your partner. [If
students have trouble describing their character, use the following questions
to prompt them: How is the character dressed? Is the character royalty? Is
this a magical character? Would you expect to find this character in a story
other than a fairy tale? In what setting might you find this character? ]

of fairy tales.


~~**TEKS 1.8.B; TEKS 1.8.C; TEKS 1.8.D**~~


~~**ON STAGE (10 MIN.)**~~


Check for Understanding


**Brainstorm:** Think about the characters in “Rumpelstiltskin” and
brainstorm what each of the characters does in the fairy tale.
_(The miller boasts to the king about his daughter; the king asks_
_the miller’s daughter to spin straw into gold; the miller’s daughter_
_seeks help from Rumpelstiltskin; Rumpelstiltskin demands the_
_(now) queen’s baby unless she solves a riddle; the messenger_
_discovers Rumpelstiltskin’s name_ . _)_


  - Place students in groups of five as you prepared in advance. Give each group
a set of cards with the characters on them. You may have students blindly
choose a card from the deck or you may choose to give each student in the
group a specific card.


  - Tell students that they will each pretend to be one of the characters.
Students should think of an action that they can do and what they can say
to give the rest of the students in their group a clue as to which character is
being portrayed. For example, as Rumpelstiltskin, a student may pretend to
be spinning and say, “What is my name?” As the king, a student may wave a
finger, or put their hands on their hips, and say, “Get to work . . . or else!” As
the miller’s daughter/queen, a student may pretend to cry and say, “I must
learn his name!”


**TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using
the conventions of language; **TEKS 1.9.C** Discuss elements of drama such as characters and setting; **TEKS 1.8.B** Describe

~~**ELEMENTS OF FAIRY TALES CHART (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Display the Elements of Fairy Tales chart for “Rumpelstiltskin” you prepared
in advance. As students discuss each fairy tale element, record a brief
description in each section of the chart.


**Setting**

 - Remind students that the setting of a story is the time and place a story
takes place, and that many fairy tales begin in a special way that gives us a
clue about when the story takes place. Ask students to listen carefully while
you reread the first sentence of “Rumpelstiltskin”: “Once upon a time, there
was a poor miller who had a beautiful daughter.”


 - Ask students to identify the phrase that begins many fairy tales. _(Once_
_upon a time . . .)_ Ask students to recall what this phrase tells them about
when the story takes place. _(long ago)_ Ask students to identify where the
story takes place. _(king’s castle)_ Record this information on the chart in the
row marked “Setting(s).”


**Characters**

 - Remind students of the royal characters in “Sleeping Beauty,” and ask them
to identify the royal characters in “Rumpelstiltskin.” You may wish to use the
Flip Book to point out each character as they are identified. Remind students
that fairy tales usually have magical characters, too, like the fairies in
“Sleeping Beauty.” Ask students to identify the magical character in this fairy
tale. _(Rumpelstiltskin)_


**Fantasy (Events)**

 - Remind students of the elements of fantasy in “Sleeping Beauty,” and ask
students to identify magical events in this fairy tale. _(Rumpelstiltskin spinning_
_gold from straw and stomping himself into the ground at the end)_


**Problems and Solutions**

 - Ask students to describe the problems faced by the daughter/queen. _(The_
_king said she had to spin gold from straw, and later she needed to find out_
_Rumpelstiltskin’s name so he wouldn’t take her child.)_


 - Ask students how the problems were solved. _(Rumpelstiltskin spun gold for_
_her, and one of her messengers discovered his name.)_

There once lived a man and his wife who, more

than anything in the world, wished to have a

baby. Finally, one day they learned that their

wish would come true.





Now, at the top of their house, in the very

back, there was a little window. And from this

window you could see a garden full of beautiful flowers and fresh vegetables.

But around the garden was a high wall. And no one dared to enter the garden,

because it belonged to a mean witch.

Unit 7 Fairy Tales


One day the wife stood at the little window and looked down into the witch’s

garden. There she saw fine-looking leaves of rapunzel, which is a kind of

lettuce. And it looked so fresh and green that she felt that she simply must

have some. Day after day she **longed** for it. ~~_Ask students what the root word_~~

~~_of_~~ ~~longed~~ ~~_is._~~ ~~(long)~~ ~~_To long for something_~~ ~~_means to want it very badly. [Point_~~

~~_out the rapunzel growing in the garden, and explain that the woman longs to_~~

~~_eat some of it.]_~~ The more she wanted it, the more she became pale and sad

when she could not have some.


Her husband saw her looking so sad and became worried. “Dear wife, what is

the matter?” he asked.


“Oh,” she answered, “I feel that I must eat some of that rapunzel from the

garden behind our house.” Her husband loved her very much, and he thought,

“I must get my wife what she desires. I will get some of that rapunzel, no

matter what.” ~~_What questions do you have so far?_~~


**Show Image 3A-3: Man stealing rapunzel**

That night he climbed over the wall into the

witch’s garden. He quickly filled a sack with

rapunzel and brought it back to his wife. At

once she ate it with **delight** . ~~Delight~~ ~~_means joy_~~

~~_or great pleasure_~~ . But she liked it so much and





it tasted so good that the next day she longed

for it twice as much as she had before. So,



that night, the husband climbed the wall again and picked more rapunzel. He

turned around to go back, when he saw before him the angry eyes of the witch.


**Show Image 3A-4: Man and witch**

“How dare you climb into my garden, you

thief,” she hissed. “How dare you steal my

rapunzel! You will pay dearly for this!”


“Oh please,” said the terrified man, “be





**merciful** . ~~_The man is asking the witch to_~~

~~_forgive him and be kind even though he stole_~~

~~_the rapunzel._~~ I only did this because I had to.



My wife, you see, is having a baby, and she was looking out the window and saw

your rapunzel, and she needed some more than anything else in the world.”


Lesson 3 Rapunzel
**49**


“Well then,” the witch said, “you may have as much rapunzel as you want—on

one condition. When your wife has the child, you must give it to me. I will take

care of the child, like it’s my very own.” ~~_Do you think the man should agree to_~~

~~_give his child to the witch?_~~


The man was so flustered that he said “yes,” and then tried not to think any

more of it. But later, at the very moment when his wife gave birth to a lovely

baby girl, the witch appeared and reminded him of his promise. She brought

the child to live with her.


**Show Image 3A-5: Rapunzel is taken**
**to a tower**

The witch named the baby Rapunzel, ~~_Why_~~

~~_do you think the witch named her Rapunzel?_~~

and she grew up to be a beautiful girl. When

Rapunzel was twelve years old, the witch took





her deep into the forest. There she locked her

in a tower with no steps and no door, only a



small window near the top. ~~_Why do you think the witch locked Rapunzel in a_~~

~~_tower?_~~ Whenever the witch wanted to be let into the tower, she would cry

from the ground below, “Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair!”


**Show Image 3A-6: Rapunzel’s long hair**

Rapunzel had beautiful, long hair that shone

like gold. When she heard the voice of the

witch, she would open the window and let her

hair fall down, down, down to the ground far

below. Then the witch would hold onto the hair







and climb up to the tower window.


**Show Image 3A-7: Prince spies tower**

A few years passed like this when, one day, the

king’s son ~~_The king’s son is the_~~ ~~_._~~ ~~(prince)~~

was riding through the forest, and he came

upon the tower. As he came near, he heard

a voice singing so sweetly that he stood still

and listened. It was Rapunzel in her loneliness

trying to pass away the time with sweet songs.



**50**



The prince wanted to go inside to see her, so he looked for a door in the

tower, but there was none. He rode home, but the song had entered into his


Unit 7 Fairy Tales


heart, and every day he went into the forest and listened to it. ~~_“The song had_~~

~~_entered into his heart” means the prince fell in love with Rapunzel’s song._~~


**Show Image 3A-8: Prince sees witch climbing**
**Rapunzel’s hair**

Once, as he was standing nearby behind some

trees, who should come up to the tower but

the witch. The prince watched, amazed, as

the witch called out, “Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let





down your hair!” Then he saw how Rapunzel let

down her long hair, and how the witch climbed



up it and went into the tower. He thought, “So that is the ladder. Well, then,

I too will climb it.” The next day, as dusk fell, ~~_Dusk is the time of day when it_~~

~~_starts to get dark._~~ he came to the tower and cried, “Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let

down your hair!” And she let down her hair, and the prince climbed up.


**Show Image 3A-9: Rapunzel and prince**

Rapunzel was greatly frightened when she

saw the prince, for she had never seen a man

before. But he spoke kindly to her, and told

how her singing had entered his heart, and

how he felt he could have no peace until he





had seen her. Then Rapunzel forgot her fear,

and when he asked her to be his wife, she



put her hand in his hand and said, “I would gladly go with you, but I have no

way to get out. Do this for me: the next time you come, bring a bundle of

silk. Then bring some more each time you come, and I will make a ladder of

it. When it is finished, I will use it to climb down from this tower, and then

you will carry me away from here on your horse.” They agreed that he would

come to her every evening since the witch only came in the daytime.


**Show Image 3A-10: Witch cutting**
**Rapunzel’s hair**

So things went on this way until one day

Rapunzel, without thinking, said to the witch,

“Why do you climb up so slowly, while it takes

the king’s son only a moment?”





“Oh, you wicked child!” screamed the witch.

“I thought I had you hidden here from all


Lesson 3 Rapunzel
**51**


the world. But you have betrayed me!” In a **rage**, the witch grabbed a pair

of sharp scissors and cut off poor Rapunzel’s hair. ~~_Rage is another word_~~

~~_for anger. Why is the witch in a rage, or acting angry?_~~ Then the witch took

Rapunzel from the tower and brought her to live even deeper in the forest.


**Show Image 3A-11: Witch and prince**

Later that day, when evening fell, the prince

came and called out, “Rapunzel! Rapunzel!

Let down your hair!” ~~_Now what questions do_~~

~~_you have?_~~ The witch lowered the cut-off hair,

and the prince climbed up. But instead of





seeing his dear Rapunzel at the top, he saw

the gleaming eyes of the witch. “Aha!” she



cried, and laughed at him. “You came for your darling, but the sweet bird is

no longer in its nest and sings no more. You will see her no more!” Filled with

horror and sadness, ~~_Horror is a strong feeling of fear or shock._~~ the prince fell

from the tower. The fall did not hurt him badly, but the thorns on which he fell

cut his eyes and blinded him. ~~_Blinded means he can’t see anymore._~~


**Show Image 3A-12: Blind prince wandering in**
**forest**

So, blind and alone, he wandered in the

forest for several years, eating only roots and

berries, and weeping over the loss of his dear

Rapunzel. At last he came to a place in the





forest where Rapunzel herself was wandering.

He heard a sweet voice that he thought he



had heard somewhere before. When he went toward the sound, Rapunzel

saw him, wrapped her arms around his neck and wept. When Rapunzel’s

tears touched the prince’s eyes, he could see again. He was both happy and

amazed because he’d thought he’d never see her again.


**Show Image 3A-13: Prince takes Rapunzel to**
**his kingdom**

And so the prince took Rapunzel to his

kingdom to be his bride, where she was

welcomed with great joy. They were soon

married, and they lived happily ever after.

Once upon a time, a mighty king lived in a

palace in the shadow of a dark, mysterious

forest. He had only one child, a beautiful little

girl with long, flowing hair, and her favorite

plaything was a bright golden ball that looked

just like the sun in the sky. Day after day, she would run and skip under the

shadow of the huge forest trees, tossing and bouncing her ball to amuse

herself. She liked to pretend that her ball was indeed the sun and that the

whole wide world was hers to play with.


One day, however, as she spun the ball in her little hands, it slipped from her

fingers, rolled over the leafy ground, and fell—splash!—into a deep **well** . She

ran quickly to the edge of the well and peered in, but her beautiful golden toy

had vanished into darkness. ~~_How do you think the princess feels? Have you_~~

**Show Image 4A-3: Princess talking to frog**
**about her lost ball**

She began to cry loudly, because she was not

used to disappointment, when she suddenly

heard a timid, scratchy voice behind her say,

“What is the matter, princess?”


Spinning around, she realized that the speaker

was the ickiest frog she had ever seen. “I have

dropped my ball into the well, and it is lost forever!” she **wailed** . ~~_Wailed is_~~

~~_another way of saying “cried loudly.”_~~


The frog looked at her and blinked. “I could get it for you, if . . .”


“Oh, froggy! I’d give you anything you want if you could get my lovely ball

back! You could have my crown!”


“I do not want a crown,” the frog said.


“Or all my jewels!” she offered.


“What would a frog do with jewels?” he wondered.


“I do not care!” the princess snapped. “Just get my ball!”


“Well,” the frog said, “I do not want jewels, but I do want a friend. It is a lonely

life being an icky frog. If I fetch your ball from the dark, chilly well for you,

will you agree to be my friend forever afterward, and love me, and share

everything that you have with me?” ~~_Do you think the princess will agree?_~~


“Of course!” the princess promised. But in her heart, she thought, “Who

cares what that old frog wants? He’ll never leave this well anyway.”


**Show Image 4A-4: Frog retrieving ball**

The frog did not know her thoughts, however,

and he dived eagerly down into the well. A few

seconds later, he emerged from the water

holding the precious golden ball between two

slimy webbed hands. “It was very cold down





there,” the frog remarked, but the princess was

not listening. ~~_Why do you think the princess_~~

~~_wasn’t listening?_~~


Unit 7 Fairy Tales


**Show Image 4A-5: Princess running away**

“Hurray!” she cried, and seizing the ball,

she immediately ran back to the palace. The

frog croaked after her, “Wait! I cannot run as

fast as you!” She ignored him, however, and

considered the matter settled. ~~_Do you think the_~~

~~_matter is settled? Why or why not?_~~


**Show Image 4A-6: Princess at dinner**

That night, however, while the **court** feasted,

a loud knock sounded on the door. ~~_Who do_~~

~~_you think is at the door?_~~ The princess loved

visitors, so she ran to open the door, but who

should stand on the palace stairs but the

icky, warty frog! She slammed the door in his

face and ran back to her delicious dinner on

her golden plate. Behind the heavy wood door, though, she could hear him

croaking: “O careful, careful, princess fair! Promises are more than air!” ~~Fair~~

~~_means to be charming or otherwise pleasing._~~


“Who was at the door, my daughter?” asked the king.


“Nobody! Just an old frog,” she said, and she told him how the frog had

**retrieved** her ball from the well ~~_or how the frog had gotten her ball from the_~~

~~_well_~~ on the condition that she would be its friend and share everything she

had with it forever afterward. She thought her father would be pleased with

how she had escaped the frog’s demands, but, to her surprise, he frowned.


“Daughter, we must keep the promises we make. What kind of kingdom

would we have if we all treated each other the way you have treated this poor

frog? The frog kept his promise to you, and he helped you; now, you must

keep your promise to him. Go and let him in.”


The princess was shocked and wanted to refuse, but she could see from her

father’s stern look that she had to obey. Unwillingly, she got up and opened

the door. The frog was still sitting patiently on the steps of the palace. When

he saw the princess, he smiled happily—a smiling frog is quite a sight to

behold—and bounced up and down with froggy **glee** . ~~_The frog bounced_~~

~~_up and down with joy, or happiness. What do you think is going to happen?_~~

with this fairy tale, tell them to listen to see how this version might be
different from the one they know.)


~~**“THE FROG PRINCE, PART II” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 5A-1: Frog and princess going to**
**the table**

Unwillingly, the princess allowed the frog into

the magnificent palace. He bounced up and

down, as frogs will when they are very happy,

but she only **glared** at him dreadfully. ~~_The_~~

~~_princess gave the frog an angry look. Why do_~~

~~_you think she glared at the frog?_~~ ~~S~~ he thought

to herself, “Why should I have to keep my promise to this old croaker just

because he fetched my ball from the well?” Her father insisted, however, that

she should be his friend just as she said she would.


The frog hopped after her into the great dining hall— _boing! boing!_ —and

immediately jumped onto the table.

**Show Image 5A-2: Frog on table**

“So, princess,” he said, “we shall be the best of

friends now.” With a **contented** croak, ~~_or with a_~~

~~_happy and satisfied croak_~~ he began to eat from

her shining gold plate and sparkling silver bowl.

Frogs do not eat very neatly, I’m afraid, and the

princess, noticing how he smeared the food

all over his face, turned away in disgust. She

refused to look at the frog or speak to him, but she still felt sick just thinking of

such an ugly creature eating with her. ~~_How would you feel about a frog eating_~~

~~_with you?_~~


“What a lovely golden plate,” the frog remarked. “It reminds me of your ball.

You have such beautiful possessions, princess. ~~_What does_~~ ~~possessions~~ ~~_mean_~~

~~_again?_~~ It must be nice to be a princess and have everything you want.”


“If I had everything I wanted,” the princess retorted, “you would not be eating

with me.” ~~Retorted~~ ~~_means to give a sharp response. So the princess snapped_~~

~~_at him. Is she being very nice?_~~


The frog ignored her rudeness. “May I have a drink from your cup?” he asked

politely. The princess was about to refuse, but her father caught her eye, and

so she nodded. ~~_Show me how the princess nodded._~~ The frog drank thirstily.

Perhaps it was because of that long hop from the well to the palace doors!

“Would you like to drink now, princess?” he asked, nudging the cup back in

her direction.


“You must be joking!” she snapped. “Princesses do not drink after yucky frogs.”


The frog sighed and continued eating, but soon he began to look sleepy.

“I’m tired, princess,” he said. “Will you take me up to bed?” ~~_Do you think the_~~

~~_princess will agree to take the frog to her bedroom? Why or why not?_~~


“I could never have such a slimy frog in my bed!” the princess burst out.


Her father was about to **scold** her, but the frog beat him to it: “O careful,

careful, princess fair! Promises are more than air.” ~~_What do you think the frog_~~

~~_means when he says, “Promises are more than air”?_~~


What could the princess do? She had promised. So she ran up the stairs

to her bedroom, and all the way up she could hear the frog hopping behind

her— _boing! boing!_ —and leaving little muddy footprints— _splish! splash!_ —on

the castle floor.

**Show Image 5A-3: Princess opening door to**
**bedroom**

She opened the door to her bedroom. The

beautiful princess and the ugly frog stood in the

doorway looking at the princess’s lovely room,

hung with silk curtains, beautiful paintings, and

jeweled lamps. A thick, soft goose feather quilt

lay across her cozy bed, and a full, plump pillow

waited to support the princess’s pretty head.


**Show Image 5A-4: Princess in bed**

The princess left the frog at the door and

climbed into her beautiful bed. She wished

the frog would go away, but he sat on the floor

looking up at her.


“I want to sleep on your pillow,” the frog said

decidedly. ~~_Do you think the princess will let the_~~

~~_frog sleep on her pillow? Why or why not?_~~


The princess shook her head. “No! Please! You can sleep anywhere you want,

just not on my bed. Please! You are just too **disgusting**, and you will leave

slime on the pillow.” ~~Disgusting~~ ~~_means awful or gross._~~


“I want the pillow,” the frog insisted. “You promised you would share

everything with me!”


The princess pleaded and cried, but nothing could change the frog’s mind.


“You promised,” he said, “and promises are more than air.”


Finally, she had to give in. Frustrated, she climbed down and tossed the frog

roughly onto the pillow, and then climbed back into bed herself.


Unit 7 Fairy Tales


**Show Image 5A-5: Frog on pillow next to the**
**unhappy princess**

She tried to keep as far away from her new

friend as possible. “I wish you’d just go away,”

she hissed into the darkness.


The frog was silent for a long minute, and

then he whispered, “Princess? There’s one

more thing.”


The princess groaned.


“Could I have a good-night kiss? I have been a very lonely frog. And you did

promise you would love me.” ~~_Do you think the princess will agree to kiss the_~~

~~_frog? Why or why not?_~~


The princess was so exhausted that she did not even bother to argue. In the

dark, she rolled over and planted one kiss on the top of the frog’s cold, wet

head. “Now, please go to sleep,” she begged.


“Good night,” croaked the frog.


The next morning, the princess woke to find the frog still snoring on the

pillow. The princess watched him sleeping for some time. She began to feel

impatient for him to wake up, ~~Impatient~~ ~~_means not wanting to wait._~~ for she

found that, gross as he was, she preferred arguing with the frog to playing

by herself. It was so quiet without him croaking away. Finally, she poked him

hard with her finger. “Get up, you lazy toad!” she said. ~~_Is she changing how_~~

~~_she feels about the frog?_~~


The frog did not stir, so with the palm of her hand, she gave him a rough

shove that sent him sliding off the pillow and onto the cold, stone floor of her

bedroom. The moment his little webbed feet touched the ground, however,

the warty frog disappeared, and in his place sat a little prince, rubbing his

eyes sleepily and smiling up at the princess. ~~_How do you think the princess_~~

~~_felt when she saw the prince?_~~

**cheerful little boy**

“Hello, princess! Thank you so much for

keeping your promise.”


“Who are you?” she asked, very much surprised.


“Why, I’m the frog,” he responded. “A wicked

witch living in the forest turned me into an ugly

frog, and only you could save me. I knew that your heart was just as golden

as your plate and your ball—and I was right! ~~_What do you think the prince_~~

~~_meant when he said that the princess’s heart was as golden as her plate?_~~ Now

I am free of her spell!” He looked at her. “Thank you, princess. Now I will leave

you alone and go back to my home on the other side of the forest.”


“Wait!” said the princess. “I thought we were supposed to be friends forever

after. And promises are more than air, you know.”


The prince laughed. “So they are. Shall we go play with your ball?”


**Show Image 5A-7: Prince and princess are**
**married**

And together they ran down the stairs and out

into the bright golden sunshine. They were

friends forever afterward, and when they were

quite grown up, they were married with great

celebration and joy. They invited the entire

kingdom to their wedding, not to mention a

number of frogs that the prince had met during his long enchantment. ~~_We_~~

~~_already learned the word_~~ ~~enchanted~~ ~~_. So_~~ ~~enchantment~~ ~~_would be his time_~~

They lived happily ever after, of course, and the princess was always glad

#### Pausing Point


~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


You should pause here and spend two days reviewing, reinforcing, and/or
extending the material taught thus far.


It is highly recommended you use the Mid-Unit Assessment to assess
students’ knowledge of fairy tales. You may also choose to do any
combination of the following activities in any order, or create other activities
that will help review, reinforce, and/or extend the material taught thus far.


~~**MID-UNIT ASSESSMENT**~~


**Elements of Fairy Tales**

  - Use an Elements of Fairy Tales chart (optional) to review what students have
learned about fairy tales. Explain that the stories they heard are considered
fairy tales because they have certain common elements.


**Directions:** I will read a question about the elements of fairy tales. If the
answer is yes, you will circle the thumbs-up. If the answer is no, or not true,
you will circle the thumbs-down.


**Note:** For students who will be using the Editable PDF Activity Page, please
have them answer by typing “yes” if the sentence is correct, and “no” if the
sentence is incorrect.


1. Do fairy tales usually begin with the words, “Let me tell you a story”?
_(thumbs-down)_


2. Do some fairy tales have a castle as a setting? _(thumbs-up)_


3. Did all of the fairy tales we heard take place a long time ago? _(thumbs-up)_

~~**ACTIVITIES**~~


**Image Review**

  - Show the Flip Book images from any Read-Aloud again, and have students
retell the fairy tale using the images.


**Image Card Review**


Materials: Image Cards 1–8

  - In your hand, hold Image Cards 1–8 fanned out like a deck of cards.


  - Ask a student to choose a card but not show it to anyone else in the class.
The student must then perform an action or give a clue about the picture
s/ he is holding. For example, for Rapunzel’s tower, a student may say, “This is
the tall home of a lonely princess.”


  - Have the rest of the class guess what is being described.


  - Proceed to another card when the correct answer has been given.


**Riddles for Core Content**

  - Ask students riddles such as the following to review core content:


    - I was put under a spell that caused me to sleep for one hundred years.
Who am I? _(Sleeping Beauty)_


    - I am a little man who was able to spin straw into gold. Who am I?
_(Rumpelstiltskin)_


    - I have long, beautiful hair that people climbed to get into the tower. Who
am I? _(Rapunzel)_


    - I retrieved the princess’s golden ball, ate from her plate, and slept on her
pillow. What am I? _(the frog who was also a prince)_


**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**


Materials: Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard

  - Give students a key unit concept or vocabulary word such as _royalty_ . Have
them brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear the word,
such as _king_, _queen_, _prince_, _princess_, etc.


  - Record student responses on chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard for
reference.


**Retelling a Fairy Tale with Puppets**

  - Have students make simple puppets of the characters from a particular fairy
tale and then use them to retell the fairy tale.

**87**



Image Cards 1–8


Support


You may use images
from the Read-Alouds as
visual reminders.


**88**



**Venn Diagram**

 - Use a Venn diagram to compare two characters from different fairy tales,
such as the princesses in “The Frog Prince” and “Sleeping Beauty.”


**On Stage** ~~**TEKS 1.9.C**~~

 - Have students think about the various characters in a fairy tale and
brainstorm what each of the characters did in the fairy tale.


 - Tell students that they will pretend to be one of the characters. Students
should think of an action that they can do and what they can say to give the
rest of the class a clue as to which character is being portrayed. For example,
as the princess in “The Frog Prince,” a student may pretend to be wailing and
say, “I’ve lost my golden ball.” As the king, a student may wave a finger, or put
their hands on their hips, and say, “Daughter, we must keep the promises we
make.” As the frog, a student may hop across the floor and say, “If I retrieve
your ball, will you agree to be my friend?”


 - Have the rest of the class guess which character is being portrayed and the
fairy tale to which that character belongs.


 - Invite volunteers to discuss what clues or details helped them guess the
character and the fairy tale.



**Letters to Fairy Tale Characters**



~~**TEKS 1.12.C**~~




  - Have students choose a favorite character from the fairy tales they have
heard in this unit.


  - Have students brainstorm what they might like to say to the character. For
example, a student may want to tell Rapunzel that her long hair is beautiful.
Students may also have questions to ask the character. For example, a student
may ask Sleeping Beauty if she will ever go near a spinning wheel again.


  - Have students write letters to the fairy tale characters. You may ask a class
of older students in the school to pretend to be the fairy tale characters and
write letters in response that you will then read to the class. Be sure to let
students know that the return letters they receive are not from the actual
characters in the fairy tales.

**Fairy Tales and Music** ~~**TEKS 1.9.F**~~


Materials: Musical recordings of Tchaikovsky’s _The Sleeping Beauty_

  - Tell students that one way to listen to a fairy tale is to hear the story read
aloud. Music can also tell stories, and many fairy tales have been told in
musical performances, such as dance and opera.


**TEKS 1.9.C** Discuss elements of drama such as characters and setting; **TEKS 1.12.C** Dictate or compose correspondence
such as thank you notes or letters; **TEKS 1.9.F** Recognize characteristics of multimodal and digital texts.


Unit 7 Fairy Tales


  - Explain to students that dancing, along with costumes, gestures, and
sometimes sets, can be used to tell stories without using words. Tell students
that there are many dance performances that are based on fairy tales,
including a famous ballet dance of Sleeping Beauty with music written by
Peter Tchaikovsky.


  - Ask students to listen carefully to the music and imagine what might be
happening in the story. Does the music sound fast, slow, scary, happy,
peaceful, etc.?


  - Ask students to draw a picture of what they imagine might be happening in
the fairy tale at that point in the music. Students may also write sentences
describing their illustration.


  - You may also wish to find a video or DVD recording of a fairy tale, dance,
or opera to share with the class. As you play the recordings, point out the
costumes, scenery, and other details of the performances.


  - Ask students to compare and contrast the different methods of storytelling.


  - Before reading, ask students to recall who wrote down the original versions
of the fairy tales more than two hundred years ago. _(the Brothers Grimm)_
Explain that modern authors sometimes take old fairy tales from the
Brothers Grimm (or other authors, such as Hans Christian Andersen) and
change the way the story is told or add new details. Tell students that these
new ways of telling old stories are called “retellings” or “adaptations.”


**Student Choice**

  - Ask students which Read-Aloud they have heard recently that they would like
to hear again. If necessary, reread the titles of recent Read-Alouds to refresh
students’ memories. You may also want to choose one yourself.


  - Reread the text that is selected. Feel free to pause at different places in the
Read-Aloud this time and talk about vocabulary and information that you did
not discuss previously during the Read-Aloud.


  - After the Read-Aloud, ask students if they noticed anything new or different
during the second reading that they did not notice during the first reading.
Also, ask them to try to express why they like this Read-Aloud. Remember
to repeat and expand upon each response using richer and more complex
language, including, if possible, any Read-Aloud vocabulary.


**Proper Nouns and Common Nouns Activity**


Materials: Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard

  - Remind students that in the fairy tale, “Rapunzel,” they heard the word
_R/ rapunzel_ used two different ways. Ask students if they can remember the

two different R/rapunzels from the fairy tale. Pause for student responses. If
students do not remember, prompt them. _(Rapunzel is the princess with the_
_long, long hair in the fairy tale; rapunzel is the lettuce-like vegetable the man_
_stole for his wife from the witch’s garden in the fairy tale “Rapunzel.”)_


 - Ask students whether people’s names are capitalized or not. _(capitalized)_
Tell students that when _Rapunzel_ is used as the name of a specific person,
like the princess, it is called a proper noun. Tell students proper nouns start
with a capital letter. When _rapunzel_ is used to refer to a type of plant, because
it refers to many, many rapunzel plants everywhere, the word _rapunzel_ is
considered a common noun. Explain that common nouns are not capitalized,
unless they begin a sentence.


 - Have students brainstorm examples of nouns that can be used as either
proper or common nouns. Write students’ ideas on chart paper, a chalkboard,
or a whiteboard under the headings of Proper Noun or Common Noun. Write
nouns with a capital letter under the Proper Noun heading, and again under
the Common Noun heading with lowercase letters. Continue to reinforce the
idea that proper nouns are capitalized, and common nouns are not, unless
the word is the first word in a sentence.


**Fairy Tale Character Illustration**

 - Use the Flip Book to show images of characters from two different fairy tales.
As you show each image, ask students to share what they remember about
each character. You may wish to ask the following questions:


   - How is the character dressed?


   - Is the character royalty?


   - Is this a magical character?


Unit 7 Fairy Tales


    - Would you expect to find this character in a story other than a fairy tale?


    - In what setting might you find this character?


  - As students share, remember to repeat and expand upon each response
using richer and more complex language, including, if possible, any ReadAloud vocabulary.


  - Ask students to choose their favorite fairy tale character to illustrate.
The picture should include an appropriate setting for the character. Have
students write a few sentences describing the character and explaining why
it is their favorite.


  - Have students share their illustrations and descriptions with a partner or
with the class.


**Vocabulary Instructional Activity**


**Word Work: Deny or Admit**


  - Remind students that in “Rumpelstiltskin,” they heard:


_“Today I brew, tomorrow I bake,_
_And then the fair queen’s child I’ll take._
_And no one can deny my claim,_
_For Rumpelstiltskin is my name.”_


  - Ask students to repeat the word _deny_ .


  - Tell students _deny_ means to refuse to accept or admit something. For
example, I would deny that I ate the last cookie if I did not eat it.


  - Ask students to tell about something that you would deny (or maybe
something they would not deny!), using the word _deny_ when they tell about
it. Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’
responses: “I would deny that . . . ”


  - Tell students the opposite of _deny_ is _admit_, which means you accept or agree
with something. Tell students you will describe a few situations. If what you
say is something that they would deny, have them say, “I would deny that.” If
what you say is something that they would admit, or not deny, have them say,
“I would admit that.” _(Answers may vary for all.)_

~~**“HANSEL AND GRETEL, PART I” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 6A-1: Woodsman and wife**
**talking** ~~_[Point to the characters as you read.]_~~



Once upon a time, near a deep, dark forest,
there lived a poor woodcutter with his wife and
two children. The boy was named Hansel, and
the girl was named Gretel. The family never had

hard, people around the land were starving, and
the poor woodcutter could not get enough food to feed his family. As he lay in
bed one night, tossing and turning with worry, he turned to his wife and said,
“What is going to happen to us? How can we feed our poor children when we
haven’t got enough for ourselves?” ~~_How do you think the woodsman and his_~~
~~_wife will solve the problem of not having enough food to eat?_~~





Challenge


If _coldhearted_ means
unkind, what do you think
_warmhearted_ means?
_(kind, welcoming, loving)_


**102**



“Listen to me,” said his wife. “Early tomorrow morning,” the coldhearted ~~_or_~~
~~_unkind_~~ woman said, “we’ll take the children deep into the woods. We’ll give
each of them a piece of bread, and make a fire. Then we’ll leave them and go
about our work. They won’t find the way home in time for dinner, and we will
eat their share.”


**TEKS 1.6.C** Make and correct or confirm predictions using text features, characteristics of genre, and structures with
adult assistance; **TEKS 1.6.G** Evaluate details to determine what is most important with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use

Unit 7 Fairy Tales


“No!” said the man. “I cannot do that. I cannot leave my children alone in the
woods, where there are wild animals. It will get dark and cold as the sun sets.”


“Then you are a fool,” snapped the woman. “You might as well accept it that
we will all starve.” Then she kept at the poor man until at last, he agreed. “But
I feel sorry for my poor children,” he said quietly.


**Show Image 6A-2: Hansel gathering pebbles**



The two children were so hungry that they
had not been able to sleep, and so they heard
everything their stepmother said to their
father. Gretel cried, but Hansel whispered,
“Don’t worry, I will think of something.” And

got up, put on his little coat, and sneaked
outside. The moon was shining brightly, and
the white pebbles that lay in front of the house **glittered** like silver coins.
~~_The pebbles sparkled._~~ Hansel stooped and filled the pocket of his coat with
as many pebbles as it would hold. Then he tiptoed back to bed and said to
Gretel, “Go to sleep, little sister.” ~~_Why do you think Hansel gathered pebbles?_~~





**Show Image 6A-3: Hansel dropping pebbles**



At daybreak the woman came and woke the
two children. ~~_Daybreak is when it first becomes_~~
~~_light in the morning._~~ “Get up, you lazybones!
We’re going to the forest to get some wood.”
She gave them each a piece of bread and said,

at once, because it is all you are going to get.
We will have supper after we return from the
woods. That is, if you are home in time.” ~~_Do you think they will be home for_~~
~~_supper, or dinner?_~~





Gretel carried both pieces of bread in her apron, for Hansel’s pockets were
full of pebbles. They all started out on their way to the forest. As they walked,
Hansel kept turning and looking back at the house, again and again. His father
said, “Hansel, what are you looking at? You must watch where you’re going.”


“Oh,” said Hansel, “I’m just looking at my little white kitten, sitting on the roof
of the house to say good-bye.” ~~_Do you think Hansel was really looking at his_~~
~~_kitten? Why did he say this?_~~

The wife said, “You little fool, that’s not your kitten. That’s just the sun
shining on the chimney. Now, come along!”


But Hansel stayed a few steps behind, and kept turning, and each time he
turned he dropped a pebble from his pocket to mark the way.


**Show Image 6A-4: Hansel and Gretel by**
**the fire**



When they were deep in the forest, the father
said, “Gather some firewood, children. I’ll start
a fire, so you won’t get cold while we work.”
Hansel and Gretel gathered a little mountain

burning, the wife said, “Stay by the fire, you
two. We have to go and cut wood. When we’re finished, we’ll come back to get
you.” ~~_Are they coming back?_~~





So Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire. After a time, they ate their bread. And
after a longer time, they got so tired that they closed their eyes and fell
asleep. When they woke, it was dark, and they were all alone. Gretel began to
cry, but Hansel **comforted** her. ~~_Hansel tried to make her feel better._~~ “Wait a
little until the moon rises,” he said.


**Show Image 6A-5: Hansel and Gretel**
**following the pebbles home**


When the full moon had risen, Hansel took his
little sister by the hand and followed the pebbles,
which glittered like silver coins and showed them
the way. ~~_What does a full moon look like? The_~~

~~_glitter._~~ They walked on through the night, and at
last, at the break of day, they came to their father’s house. They knocked on the
door, and when the woman opened it she was **shocked** . ~~_She was very surprised_~~
~~_to see Hansel and Gretel._~~ But all she said was, “Why, there you are! Why did you
stay so long in the forest? We thought you were never coming home again.” ~~_Why_~~
~~_do you think she would say this?_~~ Of course their father was glad to see them, for
it had broken his heart to leave them alone.





Unit 7 Fairy Tales


**Show Image 6A-6: Woodcutter and wife**
**arguing**



Not very long afterward, times were hard
again, and there was little food to eat. Again
the children heard their stepmother say to
their father one night, “There’s nothing left but

don’t have enough food for ourselves and the
children. This time we’ll take them so deep in the forest that they won’t find
their way back for a week!”





“But, wife,” said the man, with a heavy heart, “it would be better to share our
last bite of food with the children.” But the wife would not listen to him. And,
she knew if she kept at him, she could get him to give in and agree with her
plan as he did before.


**Show Image 6A-7: Hansel locked in house**







Much later, when their parents were asleep,
Hansel got up to collect pebbles just as
he did before. But he couldn’t get out—his
stepmother had figured out how they found
their way home last time and had locked the
door! So Hansel got back in bed and tried to
think of a different plan. ~~_What do you think_~~
~~_Hansel’s plan will be?_~~


**Show Image 6A-8: Hansel dropping bread**
**crumbs**


Early the next morning the woman roused the
children out of bed. She gave them a piece
of bread, even smaller than before. As they
walked into the woods, Hansel broke up the
bread in his pocket, and every once in a while
he stopped to throw a crumb on the ground.



“Hansel,” said his father, “what do you keep stopping and looking back for?”


“I’m looking at a little pigeon that’s sitting on the roof and wants to say
goodbye to me,” answered Hansel. ~~_Do you think Hansel is really looking at the_~~
~~_pigeon? Why is he saying this?_~~

independently.


**106**



“Little fool,” said the wife, “that’s not a pigeon. It’s only the sun shining on the
chimney.” So they walked on, and Hansel dropped bread crumbs all along the way.


The woman led the children deeper into the forest than they had ever been in
all their lives. Again, they gathered sticks for a fire, and the woman said, “Sit
there, children, and when you are tired, go to sleep. We’re going to cut wood,
and when we’re finished we’ll come get you.”


**Show Image 6A-9: Hansel and Gretel can’t**
**find bread crumbs**


Later, when it was lunchtime, Gretel shared
her small piece of bread with Hansel, because
he had left his in crumbs along the path. Then
they fell asleep. As evening came, no one came

they were alone. When the moon rose, they
started for home, but they could not find the bread crumbs. The birds had
eaten them up. “Come, Gretel,” said Hansel, “I know we can find our way.” But
they couldn’t find it. They went on all night, and the next day from morning
until evening, but they could not find their way out of the forest. They were
terribly hungry, for they had nothing to eat but a few berries. When they were
so tired that they could drag themselves no farther, they lay down under

a tree and fell asleep. ~~_What do you think is going to happen next? [Record_~~

~~_student predictions on the board/chart paper. Tell students they will hear the_~~

~~_rest of the fairy tale later.]_~~


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~

already. Ask students what they have written that might be helpful as they
retell a fairy tale. _(Elements of Fairy Tales charts, Venn Diagram)_


  - Explain to students that you will show them an example of a written
retelling of a fairy tale first. They will be able to use this later to help them
as they write their own fairy tale retellings.


  - Show students the Model Narrative you prepared in advance for
“Cinderella.” Remind students that they read “Cinderella” during the
_Different Lands, Similar Stories_ unit.


  - Read the Model Narrative aloud. Tell students that, just like all paragraphs,
this one has an introductory statement, a body, and a concluding
statement. Reread the paragraph, pointing out each of these parts and
asking students to explain how they are unique in a fairy tale:

    - Introductory statement: How do many fairy tales begin? _(“once upon_
_a time”)_

    - Body: What do we call the sequence of events in a story? (plot) What
is special about the events in a fairy tale? _(There is often fantasy, or_
_something magical that happens; there is a problem and solution)._

    - Concluding statement: How do most fairy tales end? _(“happily ever after”)_


  - Ask students what other elements of fairy tales they should include in
their retelling. _(magical characters, royalty)_ Ask students to point these

**Beginning**
As a class, collaborate to
contrast characters by
answering simple yes/no
questions (e.g., “Did the
prince in ‘Sleeping Beauty’
do anything heroic?”).


**Intermediate**
Provide students
sentence frames using an
expanded set of learned
phrases (e.g., “I think

is heroic/evil
because . . .”).


**Advanced/Advanced High**

Provide minimal support

 - Remind students that in the following lessons, they will plan, draft, and
edit their own retelling. Ask students to think about their favorite fairy
tale thus far (“Sleeping Beauty,” “Rumpelstiltskin,” “Rapunzel,” or “The Frog
Prince”). Have students share with a partner the story they will rewrite in
the coming lessons.


~~**HEROIC AND EVIL CHARACTER COMPARISON (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask students if they know what it means to be a hero.


 - Explain that a hero is a brave and good man or boy, and a heroine is a brave
and good woman or girl. Tell students that someone who is heroic is very
brave, or daring, and good.


 - Write the words _hero_, _heroine_, and _heroic_ on chart paper, a chalkboard, or a
whiteboard. Ask students to look at the words and to see if they can tell what
all three words have in common. _(All three words contain the base word_ hero _,_
_and all three words refer to people or actions that are brave, daring, and good.)_


 - Explain that someone who is evil is very bad or wicked. Evil is the opposite
of heroic.


 - Tell students that you are going to compare heroic and evil characters in the
fairy tales you’ve read thus far.


Check for Understanding


**Brainstorm:** Think about the fairy tales you’ve heard. Were there
any characters who did something brave, daring, and good?
_(Answers will vary, but may include the prince in “Sleeping Beauty”_
_and Rapunzel and the prince in “Rapunzel”.)_ What category would
we place these characters in: heroic or evil? _(heroic)_


 - Record students’ list of characters on the Heroic and Evil Characters chart.
Be sure to have students explain how the character was heroic. Record these
descriptions on the chart as well.


 - Have students identify evil characters from the various fairy tales and explain why
they might be considered evil characters. Record their descriptions on the chart.


 - Tell students that in the next Read-Aloud, Hansel and Gretel will encounter an
evil character.

It was now the third morning since they had left
their father’s house. They started along again,
always looking for the way home, but instead
only going deeper into the forest. Unless help
came soon, they would surely starve.


At about noon they saw a pretty snow-white bird sitting on a branch and
singing so beautifully that they stopped to listen. Then the bird spread
its wings and flew before them, as though to say, “Follow me!” And so the
children followed the bird until they came to a little house. The bird flew up
and **perched** on the roof. ~~_Ask students what the root word of_~~ ~~perched~~ ~~_is._~~
~~_(_~~ ~~perch~~ ~~_) To perch is to sit or stand on a high spot._~~ And then the children saw
that the walls of the house were made of gingerbread, and the roof was made
of cake, and the windows were made of clear sugar candy. ~~_What do you think_~~
~~_Hansel and Gretel will do next?_~~

Unit 7 Fairy Tales


**Show Image 7A-2: Hansel and Gretel eating**
**house**


“Let’s eat!” cried Hansel. Hansel reached up
and broke off a piece of candy, while Gretel
chewed on a piece of a wall.


Suddenly they heard a thin, screechy woman’s
voice call out from inside the house:


_“Nibble, nibble, like a mouse,_


_Who is nibbling at my house?”_


The children answered:


_“It’s only the air_ **heaving** _a sigh._


_It’s only the wind passing by.”_ ~~_Hansel and Gretel are trying to convince_~~
~~_the woman she only hears the wind making a sound._~~


**Show Image 7A-3: Old woman**


The children were so hungry, they went on
eating. But then the door opened, and a very
old woman came out, leaning on a cane.
Hansel and Gretel were so frightened that
they dropped the food from their hands. But
the old woman just nodded her head and said,
“My dear little children, what has brought you
here? Come inside and stay with me. I’ll take good care of you.” ~~_Do you think_~~
~~_Hansel and Gretel should go inside?_~~


**Show Image 7A-4: Inside the woman’s house**


So she took them by the hand and led them
into her little house. There they found a
wonderful meal of hot pancakes, with honey,
nuts, apples, and cold milk. After that the old
woman showed them two little white beds,
and Hansel and Gretel lay down and wondered
if they were just dreaming. ~~_Do you think that_~~
~~_maybe they are dreaming?_~~



Support


A thin voice is weak, or not
very loud.



Lesson 7 Hansel and Gretel, Part II
**119**


Challenge


In a previous unit, you
learned a saying that is
used to refer to someone
who is not as they first
appear. How might the
saying, “a wolf in sheep’s
clothing” apply to this
situation? _(The old woman_
_turns out to be wicked,_
_despite how nice she_
_seemed at first)._


Support


Here, rich foods are heavy
and full of fat to fill up
Hansel. _Rich_ also means to
have a lot of money. Refer
students to Poster 4M.


**120**



Now, the old woman seemed kind, but in fact she was a **wicked** witch. ~~Wicked~~
~~_means very bad or mean._~~ The story goes that she built her house just to trap
little children, and once she had them, she would cook them and eat them!
~~_Do you think this is an example of fantasy? Yes, there aren’t really witches who_~~
~~_eat children._~~ She could not see well, but she had an excellent sense of smell.
Earlier in the day, she had sniffed Hansel and Gretel coming near.


**Show Image 7A-5: Witch locks Hansel in cage**


The next morning, before the children were
awake, the witch got up and looked at their
rosy cheeks. “Mmm, what a fine meal I will
have,” she **cackled** . ~~_Ask students what the_~~
~~_root word of_~~ ~~cackled~~ ~~_is._~~ ~~(cackle)~~ ~~_To cackle_~~

~~_demonstrate what a cackle sounds like.]_~~ She
got Hansel out of bed and put him in a cage. Then she went back and woke
up Gretel and shouted, “Get up, you lazybones! ~~_Who else called the children_~~
~~_“lazybones”?_~~ Fetch water, and cook something nice for your brother. Feed
him well, for once he’s nice and fat, I will eat him!”





**Show Image 7A-6: Gretel cooking and Hansel**
**offering bone**



Gretel screamed and cried, but it was no use.
She had to do what the wicked witch said.
Day after day, she cooked pots full of rich
food for Hansel, while she herself ate nothing

would **creep** to the cage and say, “Hansel,
stick out your finger so I can tell if you are plump enough to cook.” ~~_Creep_~~
~~_means to move forward silently and slowly. [You may wish to ask a student_~~
~~_to demonstrate what it looks like to creep.]_~~ But clever Hansel held out a little
bone that Gretel had given him, and the old woman, who could not see very
well, couldn’t tell that it wasn’t Hansel’s finger. She wondered why he wasn’t
getting any plumper. ~~_How did clever Hansel trick the witch?_~~ When four weeks
passed, and Hansel seemed as thin as ever, the witch grew impatient. ~~_What_~~
~~_does_~~ ~~impatient~~ ~~_mean again? The witch got tired of waiting._~~ “Hurry up and get
a pot of water,” she snarled. “Be he fat or thin, I’m going to cook him and eat
him.” ~~_Oh no! What do you think will happen?_~~





Unit 7 Fairy Tales


**Show Image 7A-7: Gretel and witch in front of**
**the oven**



As she filled the kettle with water and lit the
fire, tears ran down Gretel’s cheeks. “First we
will bake,” said the old woman. “I’ve heated
the oven, and the dough is ready.” Then she

flames were burning brightly. “Stick your head
in,” the witch said to Gretel, “and tell me if it’s hot enough for us to bake the
bread.” But Gretel knew what the witch had in mind; ~~_What do you think the_~~
~~_witch had in mind?_~~ she knew that the witch meant to shut her in the oven,
bake her, and eat her! So Gretel said, “I don’t know how to do it. Where do I
look? Could you show me how?”





“You silly child!” cried the old woman. “There’s a big opening, don’t you see?
Why, I could fit in myself!” And she stuck her head in the oven. Then Gretel
rushed up and, with all her might, pushed the witch into the oven. She shut
the iron door and locked it tight. Gretel ran right to Hansel and let him out of
the cage.


**Show Image 7A-8: Gretel frees Hansel**


“Come, Hansel, we are free!” she cried. “The
old witch is gone!” Hansel sprang out and
hugged Gretel, and the children danced for joy
and then ran out of the house. Then, because
they had nothing to fear, they went back into

full of pearls and precious jewels. “These are
better than pebbles!” laughed Hansel as he filled his pockets, while Gretel
filled her apron.





“Now, away we go,” said Hansel. Then he said quietly, “If only we can find our
way out of the forest.” ~~_Where do you think Hansel and Gretel are going?_~~


**Show Image 7A-9: Hansel and Gretel at edge**
**of lake**


When they had walked a few hours they came
to a wide lake. “There’s no bridge, and no
stepping stones,” said Hansel. “We can’t get
across.”


Lesson 7 Hansel and Gretel, Part II
**121**


**122**



“And there’s no boat, either,” said Gretel. “But look,” she said. “Here comes a
duck. I will ask her for help.” So she called out,


_“Duck, duck, here we stand,_


_Hansel and Gretel on the land._


_Stepping stones and a bridge we lack,_


_Carry us over on your nice, soft back.”_


And, lo and behold, the duck came over. Hansel got on her back and told
Gretel to sit behind him. ~~_Do you think a duck could really take a child (or two!)_~~
~~_across a lake?_~~


**Show Image 7A-10: Hansel and Gretel emerge**
**from the woods**


When they were on the other side of the lake,
they walked on for a little while and soon found
a path. The forest began to look more and
more familiar. At last, in the distance, they saw
their father’s house. They began to run as fast
as they could. They burst through the door and
cried out, “Father! We’re home!” Then threw themselves into his arms. ~~_Do_~~
~~_you think their father will be happy to see them?_~~


**Show Image 7A-11: Reunion with father**


Ever since he had left the children in the
forest, the man had been worried sick. As for
his mean wife—he told the children she was
gone. Now, he hugged his children as though
he would never let them go. As he squeezed
Gretel to him, the pearls and jewels fell from
Gretel’s apron. Then Hansel reached into his
pockets and pulled out handful after handful of treasure.


They were together again, their troubles were over, and they lived in perfect
happiness for a long, long time.

**Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down:** In the previous Read-Aloud, you
predicted what would happen in the second half of this story.

[Read each of the items you recorded in Lesson 6.] Give me
a thumbs-up if your predictions were correct, and a thumbsdown if not. How was your prediction different from what really
happened? _(Answers will vary.)_


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


As students answer the following questions, record relevant information in the
Elements of Fairy Tales chart for “Hansel and Gretel” you prepared in advance.


1. Literal. In the beginning of Part II, Hansel and Gretel are lost in the woods.
How do they end up finding the old woman’s house? ( _They follow a white_
_bird they had stopped to hear singing. The bird has perched on top of the old_
_woman’s roof._ )

   - Literal. Describe the outside of the old woman’s house. _(The walls of the_
_house are made of gingerbread, the roof is made of cake, and the windows_
_are made of clear sugar candy._ ) Why is her house made of these things?
( _The woman is a wicked witch who tries to trick children into coming to her_
_house so she can eat them._ )


2. Literal. What new problem do Hansel and Gretel have after arriving at the
woman’s house? ( _She tells them she plans to eat them._ )

   - Inferential. Hansel holds out a bone to trick the witch into thinking he is
too skinny to eat. Does his plan work? Why or why not? ( _His plan works at_
_first, but then the witch wants to eat him anyway._ )


   - Literal. What does Gretel do to trick the wicked witch once she realizes
the witch is planning to cook her? ( _Gretel tricks the witch into putting her_
_own head in the oven, and then Gretel pushes the witch into the oven._ )


   - Literal. What do the children do once the wicked witch is gone? ( _They take_
_pearls and precious jewels they find in the witch’s house. With the help of a_
_duck, they cross a lake, and then they find their way home._ )


   - Inferential. Does this tale end happily? Justify your answer. _(Yes; the_
_children escape the witch and find their way home, the woodcutter’s_
_mean wife is gone, and the jewels from the witch’s house keep them from_
_going hungry.)_

2. Say the word _creep_ with me.


3. _Creep_ means to move slowly and quietly.


4. When my cat comes in late at night, she will creep into a corner so we don’t
notice her.


5. Usually when someone creeps, they are moving close to the ground with the
idea of not being noticed. Can you give me an example when you or someone
you know (such as an animal) might creep and why? Try to use the word
_creep_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide
and/or rephrase students’ responses: “The cat had to creep inside . . . ”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Movement activity for follow-up.** _Creep_ means to move slowly or
quietly (usually close to the ground and often with the intent of not being
noticed). Some other words that mean the same thing, or almost the same
thing, as _creep_ are _crawl_, _sneak_, _slither_, _scramble_, and _tiptoe_ . [Have students
stand up and spread out or ask for volunteers to demonstrate what it might
look like to creep, crawl, sneak, slither, scramble, and tiptoe.]

and Gretel.” Help students recall what is happening in each image.


  - Have students number the six pictures (1–6) to show the proper sequence of
events.


  - Check to see if students are able to correctly sequence the pictures.


  - As students complete this activity, have them work with a partner to retell
the fairy tale referring to their sequenced pictures. You may also wish to have
students write or dictate words or sentences that describe the pictures and
retell the fairy tale.

Writing


**Beginning**
Using the graphic

plan a paragraph by
writing a word or phrase
in each section.


**Intermediate**
Using the graphic

students with short
sentence starters in
each section.


**Advanced/Advanced High**

~~**ELPS 5.F**~~




- Remind students that they have already completed graphic organizers
detailing important information from each of the fairy tales they have heard
thus far. They have also used story maps like this one in previous units.


- Ask students to recall in the previous lesson which fairy tale they decided
to retell. Have students write down the name of this fairy tale at the top of
Activity Page 7.2.


- Help students synthesize the information from these graphic organizers to
plan their narrative paragraphs using their activity pages.


  - Begin by asking students to recall the most important character(s) and
setting(s) in their fairy tales.


  - Ask students how fairy tales often begin. _(“once upon a time”)_ Tell
students this is a good way to begin their retelling.


  - Then, ask students what problems, solutions, and magical events
happened in their story. Guide students to synthesize these into the
big parts of the story sequence. For example, in “Cinderella,” Cinderella
wanted to go to the ball but wasn’t able to. Her fairy godmother solved
that problem. Likewise, Cinderella had to leave the ball at midnight, but the
prince used a shoe she left behind to find her.


  - Finally, ask students how fairy tales often end. _(“happily ever after”)_
Encourage students to end their fairy tales this way.


- As students complete Activity Page 7.2, circulate and check in with them to
make sure they are able to sequence the main events in their chosen fairy
tale properly.


- Collect students’ work to check their understanding and provide feedback for
their drafts in Lesson 8.

~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED? (5 MIN.)**~~



10M




  - Using the Elements of Fairy Tales charts from the previous Read-Alouds,
review the characteristics of fairy tales with students. Ask students the
following questions:


    - When were these stories set? _(“once upon a time”)_


    - What magical characters have appeared in the fairy tales we have heard?
_(fairies; enchanted people, Rumpelstiltskin and Rapunzel; witches;_
_talking frogs)_


    - Do royal characters always appear in fairy tales? _(they appear often but not_
_always)_ What fairy tale did you hear that didn’t have any royal characters?
_(“Hansel and Gretel”)_


    - How do these stories end? _(“happily ever after”)_


Check for Understanding


**Stand Up/Sit Down:** [Have students stand in a circle.] We will
go around the circle, and you will each say one thing that is a
characteristic of a fairy tale, followed by one thing that is not.
For example, I will start by saying “magical characters,” which
is a characteristic of fairy tales. Then I will say “loyal puppies,”
which is not a characteristic of fairy tales. [Have each student
share, allowing students to repeat characteristics when they have
all been said, or encouraging them to use examples instead of
general characteristics.]


**TEKS 1.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and answer questions using multi-word responses;
**TEKS 1.9.A** Demonstrate knowledge of distinguishing characteristics of well-known children’s literature such as folktales,
fables, fairy tales, and nursery rhymes.

Once upon a time there was a poor widow ~~_or_~~
~~_a woman whose husband had died_~~ who had an
only son named Jack and a cow named Milky
White. All they had to live on was the milk the
cow gave every morning, which they carried to
the market and sold. But one morning, Milky
White gave no milk.



“Oh, Jack,” said the poor widow, **wringing** her hands, “we have nothing to eat
and no money. We must sell poor Milky White.” ~~_[Demonstrate wringing your_~~
~~_hands, and explain that someone might do this when they are nervous or upset.]_~~

So Jack took the cow and started down the
road. He had not gone far when he met an

“Well, Jack, where are you off to?” said the man.


“I’m going to the market to sell our cow there.”


“Oh, yes, you look like just the sort of fellow to sell a cow,” said the man.
“Now, I wonder,” he asked Jack. “do you know how many beans make five?”


Jack thought this was a strange question, but he answered anyway. “Two
beans in each hand, and one bean in your mouth—that makes five.”


“Right you are!” said the old man. And then, pulling something out of his
pocket, he said, “And here they are.” He held out five very unusual beans.
“Now, because you’re such a smart fellow,” he said to Jack, “I will trade you
these beans for your cow.”


“Well, now,” said Jack, “that would be a nice trade for you!”


“Ah, but you don’t know what kind of beans these are,” said the man. “If you
plant them tonight, then by morning they will grow right up to the sky.”


“Really?” said Jack, who was beginning to get interested.


“Yes,” said the man, “and if it doesn’t turn out to be true, then you can have
your cow back.”


“All right, then,” said Jack. He gave the man the cow, took the beans, and
went home. ~~_Do you think Jack should have made this trade? What do you_~~
~~_think Jack’s mother is going to think about his trade?_~~


Unit 7 Fairy Tales


**Show Image 8A-3: Jack is sent to bed**


“Jack, are you back already?” said his mother.
“I see you’ve sold Milky White. How much did
you get for her?”


“Mother, you’ll never guess,” said Jack.





“Oh, you good boy!” said his mother. “Did you
get five? Or ten? Maybe even—no, it can’t be—twenty?” ~~_What do you think his_~~
~~_mom is referring to?_~~ ~~(money)~~


“I told you that you couldn’t guess!” said Jack. Then, reaching into his
pocket, he said, “See here, Mother. I got five . . . beans. You plant them, and
then overnight they . . .”


“What!” cried his mother. “Beans! You gave away my Milky White for beans?
How could you be such a fool? Off to bed with you, and no supper. And as
for your **precious** beans, here they go, out the window!” ~~Precious~~ ~~_means_~~
~~_valuable or very special. Do you think Jack’s mother believes that the beans_~~
~~_are precious? Why does she say this?_~~


So Jack went to his little **attic** room, without dinner, where he flopped down
and finally fell asleep. ~~_An attic is a room at the top of a house in the space_~~
~~_under the roof._~~

When he woke up, the room looked funny. The
sun was shining into part of it, but all the rest
was dark and shady. He jumped up and went
to the window. And what do you think he saw?

his mother had thrown out the window had
landed in the garden, and overnight they had sprung up into an enormous
beanstalk, which went up and up and up till it reached the sky. So the old
man had been telling the truth!





Lesson 8 Jack and the Beanstalk, Part I
**135**


**Show Image 8A-5: Jack climbing beanstalk**


The beanstalk grew right up to Jack’s window.
All he had to do was step out onto it and then
start climbing it, like a ladder. So Jack climbed,
and he climbed, and he climbed, until at last he
reached the sky. And when he got there, he saw
a long, straight road. He followed the road until
he came to a great, big, tall house, and on the
doorstep there was a great, big, tall woman.


**Show Image 8A-6: Jack meets giant’s wife**
~~_What do you notice about the woman in the_~~
~~_picture? [Explain that giants are very strong and_~~
~~_large characters sometimes found in fairy tales.]_~~


“Good morning, ma’am,” said Jack, quite
politely. “Could you be so kind as to give me
some breakfast?”



“Oh, so you want breakfast?” said the great, big, tall woman. “Well, you’ll
be breakfast if you don’t get out of here. My husband is a **fierce** giant, and
there’s nothing he likes better than a nice cooked boy on buttered toast. ~~_If_~~
~~_someone is fierce, they are very strong and dangerous. Does this sound like_~~
~~_something that could really happen or is it fantasy?_~~ You’d better get going, for
he’ll be coming soon.”


“Oh, please, ma’am,” said Jack, “I haven’t eaten since yesterday, really and
truly.”


**Show Image 8A-7: Jack eating breakfast**


Well, the giant’s wife wasn’t so bad after all.
She took Jack into the kitchen and gave him a
chunk of bread and cheese and a jug of milk.
But Jack hadn’t half finished these when—
_thump! thump! thump!_ —the whole house

coming—someone big! ~~To tremble~~ ~~_means to_~~

what would happen next. Tell students to listen carefully to find out whether
or not their predictions are correct. (If some students are already familiar
with this fairy tale, tell them to listen to see how this version might be
different from the one they know.)


~~**“JACK AND THE BEANSTALK, PART II” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 9A-1: Jack hides from giant**


“Goodness gracious, it’s my husband!” said
the giant’s wife. “What on earth shall I do?
Quick, jump in here!” And Jack jumped into the
oven just as the giant came in.





tied to his belt. He threw them down on the
table and said **rudely** to his wife, ~~_or he said without politeness or respect_~~ “Here,
wife, cook me a couple of these for breakfast. But wait—what’s this I smell?



_“Fee-fi-fo-fum,_
_I smell the blood of an Englishman.”_


“Now, dear,” said his wife, “it’s nothing but the leftover smell of that little boy
you had for dinner yesterday. Go along and wash up, and by the time you
come back, I’ll have breakfast ready.”


**TEKS 1.6.C** Make and correct or confirm predictions using text features, characteristics of genre, and structures with adult
assistance; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and texts the student is able to read or hear to learn or clarify word meanings.


Unit 7 Fairy Tales


So the giant went off, and Jack was about to jump out of the oven when the
woman whispered, “Wait till he’s asleep. He always has a nap after breakfast.”


**Show Image 9A-2: Giant counting gold**



Support


Demonstrate and allow
students to pretend
to gulp.





The giant **gulped** down his breakfast. ~~_He_~~
~~_swallowed his breakfast quickly, in big bites._~~
Then he went to a giant chest and took out two
big bags. He sat down, and from the bags he
took out piles of gold coins. He began counting
them, very slowly: “One . . . two . . . uh, three . . .
um, ah, four . . . ” then his head began to nod,
and soon he began to snore, so that the whole
house shook.


**Show Image 9A-3: Jack climbs down with**
**the gold**



Jack crept out of the oven, tiptoed past the
giant, grabbed one of the bags of gold (which
he could barely lift), and ran lickety-split back
to the beanstalk. ~~_Do you think_~~ ~~lickety-split~~

down the bag of gold, which fell— _kerplunk!_                into his mother’s garden, then climbed down until at last he reached
the ground.





**Show Image 9A-4: Jack back home**


“Well, Mother?” he said. “Wasn’t I right about
the beans? They really are magic!” ~~_How do you_~~
~~_think Jack’s mother responded to Jack?_~~



For a while Jack and his mother bought what

gold. But at last the bag was empty, so Jack
made up his mind to try his luck again at the top of the beanstalk. He climbed
and he climbed and he climbed, and once again, sure enough, there was the
great, tall woman standing on the doorstep of her house. And once again he
asked for something to eat.





Lesson 9 Jack and the Beanstalk, Part II
**147**


**Show Image 9A-5: Jack with giant’s wife**


“Go away, boy,” said the woman, “or else my
husband will eat you up for breakfast. But,
say—aren’t you the youngster who came here
once before? Do you know, on that very day
my husband lost one of his bags of gold?”





“Did he, now?” said Jack. “How very strange!
Maybe I could help you find it, but I’m so hungry that first I must have
something to eat.”


So the great, tall woman gave him something to eat. But he had hardly taken
a bite when— _thump! thump! thump!_ —they heard the giant’s footsteps. Once
again the wife hid Jack in the oven.


It all happened as it had before. In came the giant, **bellowing** ~~_or shouting in a_~~
~~_loud, powerful voice_~~ “Fee-fi-fo-fum!” Then, after gulping down three broiled
oxen for breakfast, the giant said, “Wife, bring me my hen and my golden
harp!”


**Show Image 9A-6: Giant with hen and harp**





The wife brought them. The giant looked at
the hen and **barked**, ~~_or said loudly_~~ “Lay!” And
the hen laid an egg, all of gold. Then the giant
looked at the golden harp and said, “Sing!”
And the golden harp sang beautifully. And it
went on singing until the giant fell asleep and
started snoring like thunder.


**Show Image 9A-7: Jack running away with**
**hen and harp**



Support


Have students practice
sneaking, creeping,
and crawling as you
read this part.



Jack sneaked out of the oven and crept like
a mouse on his hands and knees. Then he
crawled up the table, grabbed the hen and
golden harp, and dashed toward the door. ~~_He_~~

~~_words from Lesson 7?_~~ But the hen began to
cluck, and the harp called out, “Master! Master!” The giant woke up just in
time to see Jack running away with his treasures.





**148**



Unit 7 Fairy Tales


Jack ran as fast as he could, and the giant came **bounding** after him ~~_or_~~
~~_leaping forward_~~ and would have caught him, only Jack had a head start. When
Jack got to the beanstalk, he climbed down as fast as he could. The gia nt
reached the beanstalk and stopped short—he didn’t like the idea of climbing
down such a ladder. But, like it or not, the giant swung himself down onto the
beanstalk, which shook with his weight.


**Show Image 9A-8: Jack calling to his mother**





By this time, Jack had climbed down and
reached home. “Mother!” he cried. “Give me
an axe, and hurry!” His mother came rushing
out with an axe in her hand. She ran with Jack
to the beanstalk, and then she screamed with
fright as she saw the giant making his way
down.


**Show Image 9A-9: Jack chopping down**
**beanstalk**



Jack swung the axe and gave a chop at the
beanstalk. The giant felt the beanstalk shake,
and he stopped to see what was the matter.
Jack gave another chop, and another, and

over. Then the giant fell down and broke his
crown, and the beanstalk came tumbling after. ~~_Does this line remind you of_~~
~~_a nursery rhyme where someone fell down and broke his crown and someone_~~
~~_else came tumbling after?_~~





**Show Image 9A-10: Happily ever after**


From then on, Jack and his mother had all the
money and music they wanted, for the hen
gave them golden eggs, and the harp sang
for them all day long. And they lived happily
ever after.

~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


As students answer the following questions, record relevant information in
the Elements of Fairy Tales chart for “Jack and the Beanstalk” you prepared
in advance.


1. Literal. What does the giant’s wife tell Jack to do in the beginning of this
part of the fairy tale when the rude giant comes into the house to gulp
down his breakfast? ( _She says he should hide in the oven._ ) Why? ( _The_
_giant likes to eat boys._ )

   - Literal. What is the first treasure Jack takes from the giant? ( _a bag of_
_gold coins_ )


   - Inferential. Why does Jack go back up the beanstalk a second time even
after hearing the giant’s bellowing voice? ( _He and his mother had spent all_
_of the gold coins._ )


   - Literal. How does the giant’s wife treat Jack the second time? ( _She gives_
_Jack breakfast and helps him hide again when the giant comes home._ )
Does she recognize Jack from before? _(yes_ )


   - Literal. What treasures does Jack take from the giant this time? ( _a hen_
_that lays golden eggs and a harp that sings_ )


   - Literal. What happens when Jack tries to escape with the hen and the
harp? ( _The giant wakes up and comes bounding down the beanstalk after_
_Jack; Jack chops down the beanstalk with an axe; and the giant falls down_
_and breaks his crown._ )


Unit 7 Fairy Tales


2. Inferential. In the first half of the fairy tale, Jack and his mother have a
problem when their cow stops giving milk and they have no other way to
eat. How is this problem solved? _(Jack steals a bag of gold from the giant.)_
What new problems does Jack encounter in this second half of the fairy tale?
_(Jack and his mother run out of gold coins; Jack is chased by the giant after_
_he steals the hen and harp.)_ How are these problems solved? _(Jack steals the_
_giant’s hen and harp; Jack chops down the beanstalk, and the giant falls to the_
_ground.)_


3. Evaluative. What parts of this fairy tale are fantasy? ( _climbing a beanstalk, a_
_hen laying golden eggs, a singing harp, the giant, etc._ )


4. Evaluative. _Think-Pair-Share:_ Do you think it is right for Jack to take the
coins, hen, and harp from the giant? Why or why not? ( _Answers may vary._ )


~~**WORD WORK: RUDELY AND POLITELY (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “He threw them down on the table and said
rudely to his wife, “Here, wife, cook me a couple of these for breakfast.”


2. Say the word _rudely_ with me.


3. To act rudely means you are doing something in a way that hurts others or is
not polite.


4. The boys rudely cut to the front of the lunch line.


5. What else does the giant do rudely in this fairy tale? Try to use the word
_rudely_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide
and/or rephrase students’ responses: “The giant rudely . . . ”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use an Antonyms activity for follow up.** The opposite of _rudely_ is _politely_,
which means with good manners and respect. In the previous Read-Aloud
you heard, “‘Good morning, ma’am,’ said Jack, quite politely.” I am going
to describe a few situations. If what I say is an example of someone acting
rudely, say “They are (or s/he is) acting rudely.” If I give an example of
someone acting politely, say “They are (or s/he is) acting politely.”


    - The boys are helping pick up apples that fell out of the bag. ( _They are_
_acting politely._ )


    - The girl was yelling at her brother for spilling his milk. ( _She is_
_acting rudely._ )


    - The boy slammed his door shut before his little sister could come into his
room. ( _He is acting rudely._ )

You may have students do any combination of the activities listed below and
they may be done in any order. You may also choose to do an activity with
the whole class or with a small group of students who would benefit from the
particular activity.


~~**ACTIVITIES**~~


**Image Review**


Materials: Flip Book Images for Lessons 7-9

  - Show the Flip Book illustrations from any Read-Aloud and have students
retell the fairy tale using the illustrations.


**On Stage**


  - Have students think about the various characters in a fairy tale and
brainstorm what each of the characters did in the fairy tale.


  - Tell students that they will pretend to be one of the characters. Students
should think of an action that they can do and what they can say to give the
rest of the class a clue as to which character is being portrayed. For example,
as the princess in _The Frog Prince, Part 1_, a student may pretend to drop her
golden ball down the well and cry out loudly. Next, as the frog, a student may
say in a timid, scratchy voice, “What is the matter, princess?”. The student
pretending to be the princess can spin around with an icky look on their face
and say in a wail, “I have dropped my ball into the well, and it is lost forever!”.
The student pretending to be the frog would look at the princess, blink,
and say “I could get it for you, if . . .”. Then, the student pretending to be the
princess would sweetly say, “Oh, froggy! I’d give you anything you want if you
could get my lovely ball back! You could have my crown!”.


  - Have the rest of the class guess which character is being portrayed and the
fairy tale to which that character belongs.


  - Invite volunteers to discuss what clues or details helped them guess the
character and the fairy tale.

in Lessons 1-9.


 - Have students draw their favorite character including details such as; what
they wear, any relevant props they hold during the story, and the setting
where they would find the character in the fairy tale.


 - Give students the sentence starter, _My favorite character is...because...._,
students will finish the sentence and add it to the page with their drawing.


 - Staple or bind the pages together to make a class book and add it to your
class library.


**Write a New Ending**


Materials: Elements of a Fairy Tale Activity Pages

 - Choose a fairy tale from Lessons 1-9, model using the Elements of a Fairy Tale
chart and rewrite the ending. For example in _Rapunzel_, change the ending so
that the prince takes Rapunzel back to his castle for a delicious lunch and to
receive an award because she helped the prince regain his sight. Rapunzel
then becomes a well-known healer in the kingdom.


 - Have students, individually or in a small group, choose a fairy tale to write a
new ending for. They can use previous Elements of a Fairy Tale Activity Pages
to rewrite the ending of the fairy tale.


 - Invite students to share their writing with the class.


**Character Forehead Game**


Materials: Note cards

 - Write the names of the fairy tale characters from Lessons 1-9 on note cards.


 - Have a student choose a note card and without looking at the character
name, they place the note card with the character name facing the other
students.


 - Ask students to take turns giving one clue about the character (what they
wear, their actions, what they might say, where they live) to the student with
the note card on their forehead. If necessary, guide students to formulate
clues that would help the student to guess the character.


 - Tell the student with the character note card on their forehead to try and
guess the name of the character.


 - Have students take turns choosing character note cards and guessing
the character.

Materials: Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard, Flip Book images

  - Create a chart on chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard with the five
senses; see, feel, smell, taste, hear.


  - Show students Flip Book images from various fairy tales and have them
identify the five senses in the image. For example, in Flip Book image 7A-4
from Hansel and Gretel; **see**   - Gretel, Hansel, old woman, dinner table, food,
etc.; **feel**    - fork, table, heat from the oven, cold glass of milk; **smell**    - fire in
oven, pie, pancakes; **taste**   - milk, pie, pancakes; **hear**   - fire crackling, old
woman talking, dishes clanking.


  - Continue to choose images to review with students.


  - Ask students to help identify the five senses in each image. Please note that
some images will not elicit all five senses.

**Show Image 10A-1: Fisherman in canoe**
**checking fishing baskets in the river**


Once, long ago in a great city in West Africa,
in the land of the Yoruba people, there lived
a **fisherman** whose luck had been bad for a
very long time. This fisherman liked to catch
fish by placing a line of baskets on **stakes**, or
tall sharp poles, which he put in the middle of
the river. The fish would move along under the river and become caught in
the baskets. ~~_This fisherman uses fish baskets to catch fish. What else might_~~
~~_people use to catch fish?_~~


Every morning he went out in his **canoe** to set his baskets on the stakes. And
every afternoon he went out again in his canoe to see what he had caught.
When the fisherman’s luck was good, the baskets would be heavy with fish.
But when the fisherman’s luck was bad, he would find his baskets just as

empty as they had been in the morning. ~~_How do you think the fisherman felt_~~
~~_when the fishing baskets were empty? (frustrated, hungry) How do you think_~~
~~_he would feel when they were full? (relieved, excited)_~~


“Bad luck again,” he always thought. Then he landed his canoe on the river
bank and prepared his dinner of cold yam **fufu**, which was all the food he
had. Many people love it. In fact, at one time it had been the fisherman’s
favorite food. But it’s hard to love a food you eat every single day, breakfast,
lunch, dinner, and snack. ~~_Are there any foods that you eat every single day? Is_~~
~~_any one of those foods your favorite?_~~ He still thought fufu was delicious when
you ate it with a fresh fish stew, cooked with onions and peppers. But there
had been no fish stew for a long time. ~~_A stew is like a soup that is made with_~~
~~_meat and vegetables and is cooked slowly._~~


**Show Image 10A-2: The fisherman dines with**
**the stranger**


One day, after he had again pulled up his
empty baskets, he noticed something unusual.
A stranger was sleeping beside the riverbank.
The stranger was dressed in beautiful clothes
that seemed to sparkle in the sun, blue and
gold, just like the scales of a fish. ~~_Who do you_~~
~~_predict the stranger is? Why do you think a stranger is sleeping on a riverbank?_~~


“I’ve never seen that man before,” the fisherman said to himself. “Is he a
traveler?” Just at that moment, his stomach rumbled. After landing his canoe
on the riverbank, he went to the stranger and woke him up.


“You fell asleep,” he said. “I wanted to make sure you were safe.”


The stranger smiled, but said nothing at all. Just then, the stranger rubbed
his stomach. He looked at the fisherman, as if asking a question. The
fisherman’s own stomach rumbled yet again. But he made himself smile.
~~_Why do you think the fisherman made himself smile? (he was hungry too, but_~~
~~_wanted to be kind to the stranger)_~~


“Would you like to share my supper with me,” he said. ~~_Supper is another word_~~
~~_for dinner._~~ “I don’t have much, only fufu. But half of it is yours.” He took his
supper from his bag, and the stranger smiled and nodded. So the two ate
fufu together by the riverbank as the sun went down. Not a word passed
between them the whole time, but having company made the yams taste
a little better, he thought. ~~_Think about a time you shared something with_~~
~~_someone. How did it make you feel?_~~

Lesson 10 The Secret of the Fishing Baskets
**165**


**166**



Night fell, and the fisherman was sleepy. He closed his eyes and yawned.
There was a powerful splash. When he opened his eyes, the stranger
was gone! Jumping to his feet, the fisherman searched up and down the
riverbank and even looked into the water. There was no sign of his dinner
guest. Had the stranger gone for a swim? Had the whole thing been a dream?
But here was the stranger’s empty dinner plate, as real as the fisherman’s
own. **Puzzled**, the fisherman finally returned home and fell asleep. ~~_Where do_~~
~~_you predict the stranger went? Why?_~~


The next morning, when he went out in his canoe to set his fishing baskets,
he looked in the water to see any sign of the stranger, but there was nothing.
He had almost forgotten the whole strange story by the afternoon, when he
went to check his baskets. Usually, the empty baskets were so light that he
had no trouble pulling them up. But now the basket took all his strength!
When he hauled up the basket, it was full of fish! Salmon, perch, carp,
snapper—the fisherman’s mouth watered just to look at them all. Already he
could smell the onions and peppers **stewing** . ~~_Why do you think his fish basket_~~
~~_was so full of fish this time?_~~


**Show Image 10A-3: The fisherman and the**
**King of the Fishes meet**


Each basket was just as full, and he hauled
them all in one by one, until he reached the
final basket in the line. The last basket had
only one fish in it, but what a fish! As big as a
person, and brilliantly colored, his scales
blue and gold in the sun. The fish turned his
face to the fisherman, his gills opening and closing against the afternoon air.
He blinked a single giant eye.


Then the fisherman nearly fell out of his canoe, because the fish spoke.


“Do you know who I am,” the fish asked, in a voice that sounded rich and jolly.
“I…I do not, Mister Fish,” said the fisherman, deciding it was better to be polite.


“We dined together last night,” said the fish. “You did not know it, but you
shared your food with the King of the Fishes. ~~_Discuss students’ predictions_~~
~~_about the stranger and if their predictions were correct._~~ That was a kind thing
to do, for I know you didn’t have very much. I intend to reward you for that
kindness.” With that, the gigantic fish leapt out of the basket and into the
water, making a splash.


Unit 7 Fairy Tales


The fisherman never saw the King of the Fishes again. But every day from
then on, his fishing baskets were overflowing with fish. He sold the fish, and
soon he had become a very rich man. He was generous, too, and he held
many banquets for the people of his city. ~~_A banquet is a special meal for_~~
~~_many people_~~ . There was one strange thing about his banquets, though, that
the people who came to eat with him always noticed. Yam fufu was never on
the menu—not even once.

6. Evaluative. _Think-Pair-Share:_ Do you think it was kind that the fisherman
shared his supper of fufu with the hungry stranger? Why or why not?
_(Answers may vary but should include evidence from the text.)_


7. Evaluative. How do both characters feel in the end? How do you know?
_(Both characters feel happy at the end of the story. The King of Fishes_
_was happy to help the fisherman and the fisherman became a successful_
_fisherman.)_

**Show Image 11A-1: The woodcutter meets the**
**apsaras**


Once, long ago in India, there lived a
woodcutter and his family. The forest the
**woodcutter** lived near was so wide and deep
that the woodcutter had never been to the
heart of it, or the part most at the center. No
one ever had.


He told his family he was going on a trip and wouldn’t return for a few days.
Then he walked far into the forest. After many hours, he came to a huge
almond tree. Excited, he took out his axe and began to chop at its trunk.


Then he began to notice a sound like bare feet on leaves, and a sound like
laughter. Confused, he turned to see four young women dancing in a circle.
The women seemed to glow, and he knew they must be apsaras, or spirits
who love to dance. He was afraid, but before he could run back to his family,
the four apsaras noticed him. ~~_Do apsaras remind you of any other magical_~~
~~_characters that we read about earlier in a fairy tale? Which one? (The fairies_~~
~~_in “Sleeping Beauty”.)_~~

Unit 7 Fairy Tales


“A human,” they said. “But you’ve come so far into the forest! Why?”


“I’m a woodcutter,” he said. “I’ve come looking for trees to cut down, so I can
sell the wood.”


The apsaras frowned. “You shouldn’t cut down trees,” they said. ~~_Why do the_~~
~~_apsaras not want the woodcutter to cut down trees? (the apsaras live in the_~~
~~_forest)_~~ “We can give you a better job. In return, you’ll have to do whatever
we say, for as long as we say. But at the end, we’ll give you any payment you
want. Do you accept our deal?”


Any payment he wanted! Excited, the woodcutter nodded his head.


“Excellent,” the apsaras said. “Start by sweeping the floor for our dinner, and
then serve us food from our pitcher!”


The woodcutter swept the forest floor clean of leaves, hoping he hadn’t made
a bad decision. ~~_Why would the woodcutter think he had made a bad decision?_~~


After sweeping the floor, the apsaras showed the woodcutter their pitcher. It
was a huge jar made of clay with a wide opening.


“Let’s order supper,” one of the apsaras said. “I’d like fresh tomato chutney.”


“I’d like sweet rice pudding,” said another.


“And my friend and I will have stewed fish,” said a third. “Please serve it all
from the pitcher.”


The woodcutter was confused. ~~_Why was the woodcutter confused?_~~ He stared
into the opening of the pitcher, but couldn’t see to the bottom. But when
he reached into the pitcher, he found plates of fresh tomato chutney, rice
pudding, and stewed fish, just as the apsaras had asked for.


He realized that the pitcher must be magical. All you had to do was ask it for
a type of food, and the pitcher would create it.


He remembered that his family was waiting for him to come home. If he
stayed and worked for the apsaras, they would give him a fantastic reward. In
the end, his family would forgive him for the worry he caused them by staying
away. And in the meantime, the pitcher would give him many delicious
meals to eat. ~~_[Pause here and ask the following question to check student_~~

**Show Image 11A-2: The woodcutter feasts**


For many days the woodcutter worked. He
cleaned the grove while the apsaras danced
and served them delicious meals from the
pitcher. He ate well, too, every delicacy he
could think of and much, much more.


Finally, one day, he could no longer stand it. It
had been weeks since he’d seen his family. They must be worrying so much,
while every day he ate delicious magic food from the pitcher. He felt terrible
and selfish. Ashamed, he began to cry so loudly that it woke up the apsaras.
~~_Ashamed means to feel bad about your actions._~~


“Stop crying,” they said. “We can’t dance when you cry.”


“I’m sad because I miss my family,” the woodcutter said.


“We don’t want sad people working for us,” said the apsaras. “Go home. Our
deal is complete, and you may have any payment you want.”


The woodcutter didn’t even have to think about it. “I want the pitcher,” he said.


The apsaras were upset. “Please choose something else,” they said. “We love
our magic pitcher. Please don’t take it from us.” ~~_Why do the apsaras not want_~~
~~_to give up their magic pitcher?_~~


The woodcutter felt bad for them for a moment. But then he imagined
himself and his family eating all the delicious food the pitcher could give
them. “We had a deal,” he said. “The pitcher is the only payment I want.”


Furious, the apsaras handed him the pitcher. “Here’s your payment,” they
said. “Our deal is done. Now go away, and never come back!” ~~_Why do you_~~
~~_think the apsaras are so upset?_~~


Happily, the woodcutter took the pitcher and walked out of the forest. His
family was excited to see him when he returned home, and they were even
more excited to learn about the magic pitcher. Every day, his wife and all his
children asked for wonderful food, and the pitcher gave them everything they
asked for. Soon, they realized they could ask the pitcher for things other than
food—treasures, gems, and gold. ~~_[Pause here and ask the following question_~~
~~_to check student comprehension.] Why did the woodcutter decide to leave the_~~
~~_apsaras?_~~


Unit 7 Fairy Tales


The woodcutter warned his family never to tell anyone about the pitcher. “If
people in this village knew about the pitcher, they would steal it. So if anyone
asks you where our good fortune comes from, just tell them we find all the
food we sell in the forest.” ~~_Why does the woodcutter think people in the village_~~
~~_would want the pitcher? What evidence helps you to know?_~~


**Show Image 11A-3: The woodcutter breaks**
**the magic pitcher**


Over time, the people of the village grew
**suspicious**, believing that there was
something wrong with the woodcutter’s story.
Slowly, **rumors** began to spread about the
woodcutter. And in the end, a group of angry
villagers came to his door.


“We don’t believe you can find all the wonderful things you’ve found in the
forest,” they said. “We think you must have stolen it all. None of us want a
thief living in our village!”


The woodcutter flushed red with shame and anger. Immediately, he ran into
the house and returned with the magic pitcher. ~~_Was your prediction about the_~~
~~_people in the village wanting the pitcher correct?_~~


“Call me a thief, will you?” he asked. He reached into the pitcher and pulled
out ten **mangoes** . “Look, look at my magic pitcher! I’m no thief! I worked
hard for my reward!” ~~_Was this the truth? Did the woodcutter work hard for his_~~
~~_reward?_~~


In triumph, he held up the pitcher. But his hands were still shaking with
anger, and the pitcher slipped from his fingers. The magic pitcher smashed
on the floor of his house. ~~_How do you think the woodcutter feels after the_~~
~~_magic pitcher smashed on the floor? How do you know? Should he have been_~~
~~_that angry?_~~


Immediately, the four apsaras appeared, dancing and laughing around the
broken pieces of clay.


“It’s ours again,” they cried.


And soon the apsaras had vanished, taking the broken pitcher with them.


Lesson 11 The Magic Pitcher
**181**


**182**



So life returned to normal for the woodcutter and his family. Every day
the woodcutter went to the woods to cut down trees to sell. He kept his
ears open for the sound of laughter, but he never saw the apsaras or their
magic pitcher again. All he had left was his **pride** . It would have to be
enough, he thought.

Students should think of an action that they can do and something they
can say to give the rest of the class a clue as to which character is being
portrayed. For example, as the witch in “Hansel and Gretel,” a student may
pretend to creep toward a cage and say, “Hansel, stick out your finger so I
can tell if you are fat enough to cook.” As Gretel, a student may say, “Come
Hansel! Now we are free!” and pretend to unlock the cage. As Hansel, a

**Grade 1 | Unit 7**
#### Culminating Activities


~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


Please use these final two days to address class results of the Unit
Assessment. Based on the results of the Unit Assessment, you may wish to
use this class time to provide remediation opportunities that target specific
areas of weakness for individual students, small groups, or the whole class.


Alternatively, you may also choose to use this class time to extend or enrich
students’ experience with unit knowledge. A number of enrichment activities
are provided below in order to provide students with opportunities to enliven
their experiences with unit concepts.


~~**REMEDIATION**~~


Remediation opportunities include:


  - targeting Review Activities


  - revisiting lesson Applications


  - rereading and discussing select Read-Alouds


  - reading the corresponding lesson in the Language Studio


~~**ENRICHMENT**~~


**Student Choice**

  - Ask students which Read-Aloud they have heard recently that they would like
to hear again. If necessary, reread the titles of recent Read-Alouds to refresh
students’ memories. You may also want to choose one yourself.


  - Reread the text that is selected. Feel free to pause at different places in the
Read-Aloud this time and talk about vocabulary and information that you did
not discuss previously during the Read-Aloud.


  - After the Read-Aloud, ask students if they noticed anything new or different
during the second reading that they did not notice during the first reading.
Also, ask them to try to express why they like this Read-Aloud. Remember
to repeat and expand upon each response using richer and more complex
language, including, if possible, any Read-Aloud vocabulary.


Culminating Activities
**193**


Image Cards 1-18



**Retelling a Fairy Tale with Puppets**

 - Have students make simple puppets of the characters from a particular fairy
tale and then use these puppets to retell the fairy tale.


**Favorite Fairy Tale**

 - Have students ask family members what their favorite fairy tale is and why.
Have students report to the class on their findings.


**Note:** The Family Letter (Activity Page 6.2) sent home after Lesson 6 asks
family members to tell students what their favorite fairy tale is and why.


**Mixed-Up Fairy Tales**


Materials: Image Cards 1–18

 - Divide the class into three groups. Mix up the Image Cards, and give each
group five or six cards. Tell students that they will make up a new fairy tale
using the images on the cards as prompts. Ask students in each group to sit
in a circle and then explain that they will take turns adding to the story as
they draw a card from the pile.


 - Start each group off with the words, “Once upon a time . . . ” Then have
students take turns choosing a card and adding to the story to create a
continuous narrative, using the picture as a prompt. You may want students to
lay the cards out in order so that they can retell their mixed-up fairy tale again.
After the last card is played, say together, “and they lived happily ever after.”


 - After the groups have made up their stories, have the groups come back
together and share with the class. You may also do this in a large group with
all seventeen cards for a really mixed-up fairy tale!


**Letters to Fairy Tale Characters**


Materials: Writing materials, writing tools

 - Have students choose a favorite character from the fairy tales they have
heard in this unit.


 - Have students brainstorm what they might like to say to the character. For
example, a student may want to tell Hansel how brave he was. Students may
also have questions to ask the character. For example, a student may ask
Rapunzel how she spends her days now that she lives in the castle.


 - Have students write letters to the fairy tale characters. You may ask a class
of older students in the school to pretend to be the fairy tale characters and
write letters in response that you will then read to the class. Be sure to let
students know that the return letters they receive are not from the actual
characters in the fairy tales. This may also be a good opportunity to review
the differences between fiction and a true story.


Unit 7 Fairy Tales



**194**


**Fairy Tales and Music**


Materials: Musical recordings of Tchaikovsky’s _The Sleeping Beauty_ and/
or Humperdinck’s _Hansel and Gretel_

  - Tell students that one way to listen to a fairy tale is to hear the story read
aloud. Music can also tell stories, and many fairy tales have been told in
musical performances, such as dance and opera.


  - Explain to students that dancing, along with costumes, gestures, and
sometimes sets, can be used to tell stories without using words. Tell students
that there are many dance performances that are based on fairy tales,
including a famous ballet dance of _Sleeping Beauty_ with music written by
Peter Tchaikovsky.


  - Tell students fairy tales can also be told through another type of musical
performance called opera. Explain that opera is a way of telling stories with
music, singing, and acting. Performers sing the words of the story to music,
wear costumes, and act out the movements of the characters. (Engelbert
Humperdinck’s opera _Hansel and Gretel_ is one example.)


  - Ask students to listen carefully to the music and imagine what might be
happening in the story. Does the music sound fast, slow, scary, happy,
peaceful, etc.?


  - Ask students to draw a picture of what they imagine might be happening in
the fairy tale at that point in the music. Students may also write or dictate
sentences describing their illustration.


  - You may also wish to find a video or DVD recording of a fairy tale, dance,
or opera to share with the class. As you play the recordings, point out the
costumes, scenery, and other details of the performances. Ask students to
compare and contrast the different methods of storytelling.


**Home Sweet Home**


Materials: School lunch-sized milk cartons; graham crackers and white
frosting (canned is fine); plastic knives and paper plates; assorted
snacks and candy for decoration

  - Show Image Card 11 (Candy House), and ask students to describe what they
see in the picture. Tell students that where the story takes place is called the
setting. Tell students that they are going to make their own witch’s house
(the setting of the fairy tale).


  - Rinse milk cartons and allow them to dry. Tape the top of each carton so that
it forms a peak. Place a milk carton on a paper plate for each student. Break
the graham crackers in half.


Culminating Activities
**195**


**196**




 - Have students frost one side of each graham cracker, then place each
graham cracker on each side of the milk carton and press firmly to attach. Do
the same for the roof.


 - Using the frosting as glue to attach, decorate the gingerbread house with
assorted gumdrops, peppermints, candy canes, red hots, sprinkles, bitesize cookies, pretzels, mini-marshmallows, and other candies. If you use
homemade icing, be sure to keep it covered.


**Note:** Be sure to follow your school’s policy regarding food distribution
and allergies.


**Grow Your Own Beanstalk**


Materials: Paper towel; bean seeds; paper cups; soil; water

 - Show Image Card 15 (Beanstalk), and ask students to describe what they see
in the picture.


 - Tell students that they are going to grow their own real beanstalk. (The giant
beanstalk is a fantasy element of the fairy tale.)


 - Germinate seeds in a wet paper towel. Fill paper cups with dirt, and plant
the seeds about one inch deep. Water until moist (not wet). Keep plants by a
sunny window in the classroom and water as needed to keep the soil moist.


 - You may want to have students observe, measure, and record growth on a
regular basis.

She wore her yellow sun-bonnet,
She wore her greenest gown;

And curtsied up and down.
She turned to the sunlight
And shook her yellow head,
And whispered to her neighbour:
“Winter is dead.”
