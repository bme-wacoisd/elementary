Introduction
**1**


**2**



~~**WHY ASTRONOMY IS IMPORTANT**~~


In this unit, students will be introduced to the solar system—our home in space. They will learn that
Earth, the planet on which we live, is just one of many different celestial bodies within the solar
system. They will learn how the sun, stars, moon, and other planets relate to the earth (given its
position in space). In the early Read-Alouds, students will learn that the sun is a star and a source of
energy, including light and heat, for the earth. They will also learn about the earth’s orbit around the
sun, and how the earth’s own rotation on its axis leads to the phenomenon of day and night.


In the second half of this unit, students will learn about the history of space exploration and the
missions to the moon. Students will learn about NASA, the Space Race, the Apollo missions, and
what it takes to be an astronaut. Students will get a good introduction to the basics of astronomy
in this unit, and this foundation will be built upon when students study the solar system in much
greater depth in the third grade.


This unit also provides opportunities for students to build content knowledge and draw connections to
social studies and science subject areas. At times throughout the unit, you may wish to build on class
discussions to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of History and
Science, Technology, Recurring Themes and Concepts, and Society from the Social Studies TEKS,
as well as the strands of Earth and Space, and Scientific and Engineering Practices from the Science
TEKS. For more information about the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the
complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED**~~


The following units, and the specific core content that was targeted in those units, are particularly
relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _Astronomy: Space Exploration_ . This background
knowledge will greatly enhance your students’ understanding of the Read-Alouds they are about to
enjoy:


Seasons and Weather: As the Earth Turns (Kindergarten)


Early American Civilizations: Aztecs, Maya, Incas (Grade 1)


~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR ASTRONOMY: SPACE EXPLORATION**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _Astronomy: Space Exploration_ in the
forms in which they appear in the Read-Alouds. Boldfaced words in the list have an associated Word
Work activity. The inclusion of the words on this list does not mean that students are immediately
expected to be able to use all of these words on their own. However, through repeated exposure
throughout the lessons, they should acquire a good understanding of most of these words and begin
to use some of them in conversation.

~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit, students will explore the genres of informational and opinion writing. They will learn to
identify important facts and information before, during, and after informational Read-Alouds. They
will practice collecting and synthesizing information by note-taking as a group with a Planets Chart
and other graphic organizers. Students will independently journal one- to three-sentence responses
to Read-Alouds and activities throughout the unit. In Lesson 6, you will model opinion paragraph
writing. Then in their subsequent journal entries, students will write opinion statements in which
they state an opinion and supply reasons for it. The following activities may be added to students’
writing portfolios to showcase student writing within and across units:


  - Astronomy Journals (Lessons 1, 3, 4, 6–9.)


  - any additional writing completed during the Pausing Point, Unit Review, or Culminating Activities


~~**FOUNDATIONAL ORAL LANGUAGE**~~


The Think-Pair-Share and Turn-and-Talk prompts throughout the unit provide opportunities to teach
and reinforce how to communicate by using conventions of language, speaking when recognized,
and making appropriate contributions to discussion.


  - You can also reinforce these ideas by modeling using an appropriate pace, recognizing students’
individual contributions to group discussions, and pointing out conventions of language.


  - Explain to students that when working in whole/small groups, group members share responsibility
for the work they do together. To work effectively and respectfully, everyone should recognize the
contributions made by each group member. For example, as group members discuss a text, each
group member can share thoughts and reactions. If preparing to return to a whole-group discussion,
group members can summarize the group’s ideas by including contributions from everyone in the
group.


  - Consider using a discussion checklist that tracks student participation, as well as introducing
discussion techniques that enhance participation.

~~**TEKS 1.1.C; TEKS 1.1.D**~~


**TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using the conventions of language;
**TEKS 1.1.D** Work collaboratively with others by following agreed-upon rules for discussion, including listening to others, speaking when recognized, and making
appropriate contributions.

~~**CORE CONNECTIONS (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that over the next few weeks they will be learning about
astronomy, the study of outer space.


  - Ask students if they have ever heard of outer space. If so, guide students in
a discussion about what can be found in outer space (beyond the earth).
As students volunteer what they know, remind the class of the importance
of speaking clearly and at an appropriate pace when participating in a
discussion. ~~**[TEKS 1.1.C ]**~~


  - Tell students that they might be surprised to know that they see objects from
outer space in the sky every day. Ask the following questions:


    - What is the big, hot, bright object we can see in the sky during the day?
( _the sun_ )


    - What is the big object that we can see in the sky, mainly at night, that
appears to be glowing? ( _the moon_ )


    - What are the smaller lights that appear to be twinkling that we can see in
the sky at night? ( _the stars_ )


  - Point out that all of these objects—the sun, moon, and stars—are actually in
outer space. Invite students to ask questions to clarify their understanding of
outer space.


  - Tell students that over the next few weeks, they will learn more about the sun,
the moon, the stars, and other objects in outer space.

The earth is located in
space. When we use the
term “outer” space, we are
referring to areas beyond
the earth’s immediate
atmosphere. If students
name objects that they
can see in the sky—such
as airplanes, birds, or
clouds—keep in mind that
these objects are in the
first level of sky called the
atmosphere, so they are
not considered to be in
outer space.

Support


Show students a rendering
of Earth in space to help
them visualize this idea.


Challenge


If _astro–_ means stars,
what do you think
an astronomer’s job
might be? _(Answers_
_may vary, but should_
_include something to_
_do with stars.)_

~~**WHERE ARE WE? (5 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.6.D**~~


  - Show students a globe, and tell them that the globe is a model of the earth,
where we live. Point to the appropriate location on the globe as you say the
following:


    - You live in [your town].

    - [Your town] is in the state of Texas.

    - You live in [your county].

    - [Your county] is in the state of Texas.

    - Texas is in the country of the United States of America.

    - The United States of America is on the continent of North America.

    - North America is on Earth.

    - Earth is in space.


  - Explain that like the globe, Earth is a huge sphere, and it is always moving
in space. Tell students to imagine they have traveled in a rocket far, far up in
the sky and are looking back down. Explain that they would see something
like this globe, moving in a huge, black, seemingly endless space. Point out
that the mental image of this globe from above can help them understand an
important fact about Earth. Even though the ground we stand on seems still,
it isn’t. Emphasize the following points:


    - The earth, sun, moon, and stars are all in space.

    - The sun, moon, and stars are beyond the earth, where we live. To us on
Earth, the sun, moon, and stars are in outer space.


~~**UNIT INTRODUCTION (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that the name for the study of objects in outer space—the area
beyond the earth—is astronomy.


  - Ask students to repeat the word _astronomy_ .


  - Explain that _astro–_ means stars, and that astronomy is a science that
includes the study of the stars.


  - Ask students to say the word _astronomer_ .


  - Explain that astronomers are scientists who study outer space. Tell students
that astronomers look at the stars through telescopes and try to learn about
our universe. A person must study for many years before becoming an
astronomer.


  - Tell students that over the next few weeks, they will pretend to be
astronomers as they learn about outer space.


**TEKS 1.6.D** Create mental images to deepen understanding with adult assistance.

**Language:** Students will demonstrate an understanding of the Tier 3 word _gas_ .

~~**TEKS 1.3.B**~~


~~**PURPOSE FOR LISTENING**~~


  - Explain to students that the sky they see during the day or night actually has
two parts: the part with air and clouds that looks blue during the day and is
close to Earth, called the atmosphere; and a huge, black part even farther
away called outer space.


  - Tell students to listen carefully to hear about some objects they can see in
the sky, and to hear which of these objects are located in the atmosphere and
which are located in outer space.


~~**“INTRODUCTION TO THE SUN AND SPACE” (10 MIN.)**~~

clear, blue sky, or maybe there were a few puffy,







white clouds floating around. Or maybe the sky

was streaked with gray clouds.


**Show Image 1A-2: Plane, bird, red balloon, clouds**

Occasionally when you look up in the sky you

puffy, white clouds overhead. Perhaps you or someone you know has even

flown in an airplane, up among the clouds high above the earth’s **surface** . ~~_The_~~

~~_ground we walk on is the top layer of the earth called the earth’s surface._~~


**Show Image 1A-3: Bubble of air**

You can think of the sky in two layers. There is

a big blanket or bubble of air that surrounds

Earth. This bubble covers the whole earth—all

the ground and oceans and everything else

on the earth’s surface, including you! This





bubble of air is called the **atmosphere** . But

the atmosphere does not tell the whole story.



Support


Here the word _space_
means the region beyond
Earth’s atmosphere in
which there are stars
and planets. The word
_space_ can also mean a
blank area separating
written or printed words.
Refer to Poster 1M in
the Flip Book to help
students understand the
different meanings.


Support


Do you recall what the
word _enormous_ means?
_(very large)_


**12**



The second layer of the sky is all of outer space, which lies beyond the

atmosphere, an endless expanse of stars and moons and other objects.


Of course, during the day here on Earth, it is easy to forget that outer space

is there, but it always is. The earth—your home—is just one little object

moving around in the middle of it all, like a speck of sand amidst all the sands

in the ocean.


**Show Image 1A-4: Sun over a field**

During the day, the sun shines over the earth,

shedding light on all the animals and plants

that live on the earth’s surface. The sun’s **rays**

~~_or beams of light_~~ spread across the skies, which

appear blue to your eyes.





The sun itself is a star. It is not part of Earth or

Earth’s sky. In fact, the sun is far, far away from

Earth—so far away that it would take more than three months to reach it in

the fastest rocket ship. But even if you could reach the sun in a rocket ship,

you would never be able to get close to it. That is because the sun, like other

stars, is an enormous ball of very hot **gas** . ~~_That means the sun is not a solid_~~

~~_object or a liquid. It is made of superheated gas, a thin substance that objects_~~

~~_can pass right through—if they didn’t burn up first!_~~ Everything that gets too

close to it burns up instantly.


Just how enormous is the sun? Think about this: if the sun were a huge bowl

and the earth were a little marble, you could stuff about one million marbles

into that bowl. In other words, it would take a million Earths to fill the sun!


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


~~_[Show the globe.] The real Earth is much, much bigger than this. The sun is_~~

~~_gigantic if it’s the same size as a million Earths!_~~


**Show Image 1A-5: The sun**

The sun is just one out of billions of stars in

space. However, the sun is our star; it is the

earth’s star. Without the sun, Earth would be a

cold, lifeless hunk of rock. All living things on

Earth that you can see every day—from the trees





to the bees to the flowers and the fleas—rely on

the sun in one way or another. The heat, light,



and energy of the sun allow life to flourish here on Earth. ~~_Most living things_~~

~~_wouldn’t be able to live without the heat, light, and energy of the sun. What_~~

~~_questions do you have about what we have learned so far?_~~


**Show Image 1A-6: Sunrise**

The rising sun signals the start of a new day. In

the morning, the sun rises in the east, and its rays

shed light across the land. ~~_The sun warms up the_~~

~~_land, too. It’s usually colder at night than during_~~

~~_the day._~~ People wake up and get ready for a new





day, getting dressed and eating breakfast, and

then traveling outside to wherever it is they go—



to school, to work, to a store, or simply out for a walk.


**Show Image 1A-7: Shadows**

Have you ever noticed your **shadow** on the

ground? If the sun is behind you while you are

walking down the sidewalk, then your body

blocks the sun’s rays and creates a shadow

~~_or shaded spot_~~ on the ground. Your shadow is





not the only shadow in the world. ~~_[Point to the_~~

~~_shadows in the image.]_~~ Clouds cast shadows



as well. So do buildings and trees. Have you ever rested under the shade of a

tree on a hot summer day? If so, you were resting in the shadow cast by the

tree’s leaves and branches.

**Show Image 1A-8: Applying sunscreen**

On a hot summer day you can feel the warmth

of the sun on your skin, and if you do not use

sunscreen ~~_[Point to the sunscreen.]_~~ then you

may get a sunburn. Ouch! The sun’s energy can

burn your skin, and that’s bad. Sunburns hurt,

and if you get sunburned too often, it can cause

serious damage to your skin.



On the other hand, the sun’s light is also good for you. When your bare skin is

exposed to sunlight, your body creates Vitamin D, which is one of the many

vitamins your body needs in order to stay healthy and strong. So playing

outside in the sunshine isn’t just fun; it’s good for you, too!


**Show Image 1A-9: Moon**

At the end of each day, when the sun goes

down in the west, the sky changes. It isn’t blue

anymore. The sky becomes black, and new

sights appear. Instead of clouds and birds and

blue sky, you may see an array of shining stars.





You may see something else, as well—not the

sun, but another object hovering in the skies



above: the moon. ~~_[Point to the moon in the image.] Sometimes you can also_~~

~~_see the moon during the day._~~


**Show Image 1A-10: Outer space**

Over the next several days you will learn about

the sun, the moon, the stars, and you will hear

all sorts of amazing and interesting facts about

outer space—the place beyond the earth’s sky

or atmosphere. This study of the stars and





other things in outer space is called astronomy.

~~_Do you remember what_~~ ~~astro–~~ ~~_means?_~~ ~~(star)~~



**14**



The Read-Alouds you will hear in the coming days will provide a basic

introduction to astronomy, but it’s only a beginning. There is so much to

learn about the stars and other objects in space, that you can spend the rest

of your life studying it and never run out of new things to learn and discover.

That is because astronomy is the study of everything beyond our little

home that we call Earth. ~~_Do you remember what an astronomer is?_~~ And if

astronomers have learned anything through the years, they know that there


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


is no end to the amount of new knowledge and surprises to be discovered in

the study of the stars and outer space.


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** You just heard that the sky can be described as having two layers.
One layer of sky is made up of a blanket or bubble of air that surrounds the
earth. What do we call this bubble of air? ( _the atmosphere_ )

**Show Image 2A-1: Sunrise**

All plants, animals, and people rely on the sun for

life. The sun’s energy gives life to plants, which in

turn provides food for animals and people. The

sun’s heat keeps the surface of the earth warm

enough for plants and animals to survive.





For people on Earth, it makes sense to say that

the sun rises in the morning. Each morning at dawn, the sun appears on

the **horizon** in the eastern sky. ~~_The horizon is the line in the distance where_~~

~~_it appears that the land meets the sky._~~ At dawn, some people say, “Look!

The sun is coming up!” This first appearance of the sun above the eastern

horizon is called sunrise.


**Show Image 2A-2: Sunset**

Over the course of the day, the sun appears

to move across the sky, gradually following its

path from east to west. In the evening, the sun

sets in the west.

Ever so slowly, it gets lower in the sky and





disappears below the horizon.

Lesson 2 The Earth and the Sun
**25**


That’s when people say, “The sun is going down.” This disappearance of the

sun below the western horizon is called sunset.


So, based on what we can see from where we live on Earth, it seems sensible

to say that the sun moves across the sky each day—rising, or moving up, in

the east; and setting, or sinking down, in the west. ~~_In fact, that’s exactly what_~~

~~_people thousands of years ago thought was happening._~~ But that’s not actually

true. It is the daily rotation, or spin, of the earth that makes the sun appear to

rise and set each day.


**Show Image 2A-3: Earth’s rotation**

Earth **rotates**, or spins, on its axis. ~~_[Show the_~~

~~_globe.] Remember how we made the globe_~~

~~_rotate earlier?_~~ Imagine the earth’s axis as an

imaginary pole sticking through the center of

the **planet** from north to south. It takes twenty




four hours, or one day, for the earth to spin, or

rotate, all the way around one time.

**Think of a Word:** With your body, mimic the movement of the
earth as it is described here. [Encourage students to stand and
spin in place.] Think of one word that describes this movement.

[Ask several students to share.] _(Answers may vary, but may_
_include_ spins _,_ rotates _,_ turns _, etc.)_


This daily rotation explains why there is always night and day on Earth. As

it spins, certain parts of Earth’s surface face the sun, receiving its heat and

light. When it is light on one side of the earth, it is dark on the other side. So,

if it is daytime where you are right now, then on the other side of the earth it

is nighttime, and the children there are sound asleep. ~~_[Using the globe from_~~

~~_earlier in the lesson, point out to students a country that is on the opposite_~~

~~_side of the world from them.]_~~ And, when you are nestled in your bed tonight,

children on the other side of the planet will be waking up to a bright new day.


**TEKS 1.9.F** Recognize characteristics of multi-modal and digital texts.


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


**Show Image 2A-4: Orbit diagram**

This spinning or rotation of the earth, however,

is not the only way Earth moves in space.


Because Earth is a planet, it also moves, or

revolves, around the sun. The word planet means

a large object in space that revolves around a

star for light. ~~_Remember that the sun is a star and_~~



~~_provides the earth with light._~~ Earth moves, or revolves, around the sun, following

a constant path. The path that Earth follows around the sun is called the earth’s

**orbit** . ~~_Remember when I carried the globe around the plastic hoop sun? I was_~~

~~_imitating the earth’s orbit._~~


Earth follows the same path as it revolves around, or orbits, the sun. It

takes about 365 days, or one year, for Earth to make one complete orbit, or

revolution, around the sun. But how and why does Earth orbit the sun? The

answer to this question involves one of the most important lessons you can

learn in the study of astronomy.


In space there are large objects, like the sun, and there are smaller objects,

like the earth and moon. All objects in space actually pull on all other objects,

but larger objects pull harder than smaller objects. The force that causes

objects to pull on each other is called **gravity** . As this pulling action happens,

the force of the sun’s gravity holds Earth in its place. Although Earth

continues to follow its orbit around the sun, the earth does not wander off

into space. ~~_So the sun’s gravity holds the earth in place._~~


**Show Image 2A-5: Person jumping**

Just as the sun pulls on the earth and other

objects out in space, the earth pulls on objects

on or near its surface. Because of this, your feet

stay planted firmly on the ground. And if you

jump up, you come back down. If you throw a





ball in the air, it falls back down, too. This force

of gravity holds things on the ground and holds

the planet Earth in orbit around the sun.



Lesson 2 The Earth and the Sun
**27**


**Show Image 2A-6: Student at desk**

You cannot tell that the earth is always moving as

you sit in your classroom or wherever you happen

to be. It rotates, or spins, all day and every day as

it travels in its year-long course around the sun.

These two types of movement—the rotation and

the orbit of the earth—create the days and years

that we keep track of on the calendar.

   - **Inferential.** What else did you learn about the sun in today’s Read-Aloud?
_(Answers may vary, but may include that it is very big, far away, a source of_
_heat and light, a star, etc.)_


5. **Inferential.** The earth moves in two different ways. One way the earth moves is by
orbiting the sun. What is the other way it moves? ( _It spins or rotates on its axis._ )

   - **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ How is an orbit different from a rotation?
_(Answers may vary, but should include that an orbit is the path one object_
_takes around another, like the earth around the sun, whereas a rotation is_
_when something spins, like the earth around its axis.)_


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


~~**WORD WORK: ROTATES (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Earth rotates, or spins, on its axis.”


2. Say the word _rotates_ with me.


3. If something rotates, it spins.


4. A top rotates many times until it comes to a complete stop.


5. Can you think of an example of anything else that rotates? Try to use the
word _rotates_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses: “A rotates when . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** [Write _rotate, turn,_ and
_twirl_ on the board.] Some words mean almost the same thing but are still
different. The words might express more or less action. For example, rotate,
turn, and twirl mean almost the same thing but they are different. Watch as I
act out the words [Say the word _rotate_ and slowly spin around a few times or
walk from one corner of the room to another corner, rotating back and forth
a few times. Say the word _turn_ and stand in one place and turn your body
around 360 degrees. Say the word _twirl_ and quickly spin around a few times
moving your arms.] Talk with a partner about what you noticed was different
about the three words.


I am going to read a sentence that has a word missing. With your partner I
want you to decide if the word _rotate, turn,_ or _twirl_ fits best and explain why.


 - She likes to her hair. _(twirl)_


 - We to each activity around the class. _(rotate)_

~~**TEKS 1.7.F; TEKS 1.12.B**~~


~~**SAYINGS AND PHRASES (5 MIN.)**~~


**AM and PM**

  - Remind students that each time the earth makes one complete rotation, one
full day passes. There are twenty-four hours in one full day.


  - Tell students that half of twenty-four hours is twelve hours, so there are
approximately twelve hours in the day and twelve hours in the night.


  - Point to the numbers on a clock dial as you count one o’clock through twelve
o’clock.


  - Explain to students that, in the United States, we don’t say thirteen o’clock
through twenty-four o’clock for the last twelve hours of the day. Instead, after
we count to twelve o’clock for the morning hours, we start at one o’clock and
begin counting to twelve all over again for the afternoon and evening hours.


  - Tell students that there are two twelve o’clocks: one at noon and one at
midnight; two one o’clocks, one in the afternoon and one at night; two two
o’clocks, and so on. Explain to students that since there are two twelve
o’clocks, etc., people need to know at what time of day (morning, afternoon,
or evening) we are referring to.


  - Tell students that this is the reason why, if we are talking about the hours
between midnight and one minute before twelve o’clock noon, we say “a.m.”
Have students repeat “a.m.”


  - Tell students that “a.m.” stands for two Latin words ( _ante meridian_ ) that
mean “before noon.”


  - Explain that if we are talking about noon or the hours between twelve o’clock
noon and one minute to midnight, we say “p.m.” Have students repeat “p.m.”


**TEKS 1.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and answer questions using multi-word responses;
**TEKS 1.7.F** Respond using newly acquired vocabulary as appropriate; **TEKS 1.12.B** Dictate or compose informational texts,
including procedural texts.


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


 - Tell students that “p.m.” stands for two other Latin words ( _post meridian_ ) that
mean “after noon.”


 - As you read the following example, point to the corresponding numbers on a
clock dial: “If the time is one hour before twelve noon, we say that it is eleven
o’clock a.m. If the time is one hour after twelve noon, we say that it is one
o’clock p.m.”


 - Tell students which activity you are usually engaged in at noon so that they
can judge if they have reached noon yet today. Then point to the clock, and
tell students what time it is.


Check for Understanding


**One-Word Answer:** Based on what you now know, would you add
“a.m.” or “p.m.” to the current time? _(Answers will vary.)_


 - Find opportunities each day to talk about _a.m._ and _p.m_ .


~~**DAY AND NIGHT DEMONSTRATION (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students that earlier in the day they saw a demonstration of how the
earth rotates on its axis and revolves around the sun.


 - Explain that now you will repeat that demonstration, but that this time you
will use a flashlight to demonstrate day and night. This demonstration will
help students understand what’s happening in the sky at sunrise and sunset.


 - Show students the globe with Texas marked by a flag or pin. Darken the
room.


 - Ask a volunteer to point the flashlight at the globe while you hold it steady.
Tell students that the flashlight represents the sun. Tell students that when
the marked area is directly in the path of the sun, it is day in your town.


 - Explain that when it is day in your town, it is night on the opposite side of the
globe. Identify the country directly opposite your town (i.e., on the other side
of the globe). Have students observe that when it is day in your town, the
country on the opposite side of the globe is not illuminated and is in shadow.
Then slowly spin the globe counterclockwise until that country is hit directly
by the flashlight’s beam. Ask a volunteer to point to the flag or pin for your
town without spinning the globe. Ask students whether it is day or night in
your town when the sun is hitting the opposite side of the globe. ( _night_ )


 - Now continue slowly spinning the globe counterclockwise, until the flag or
pin representing your town is once again directly in the beam of light.



Support


You may wish to have
students come up with
motions and/or sounds
to represent daytime and
nighttime, and sunrise

Lesson 2 The Earth and the Sun
**31**


**32**




- Explain that when the globe makes a full rotation, one whole day, or twentyfour hours, has passed on the earth. Remind students, however, that when it
is day in one place on the globe, it is night on the opposite side. The side of
the globe not facing the sun is in shadow, which makes the sky dark.


- Now, tell students that by using the globe, you are going to show them how
sunrise and sunset happen. Ask another volunteer to point the flashlight
at the globe and hold it steady, reminding students that the flashlight
represents the sun, the globe is the earth, and the flag or marked area on the
globe is the town in which they live.


- Start with the marked side of the globe turned away from the flashlight. Say,
“It’s night in our town now.” Then spin the globe very slowly counterclockwise
(or to the left). Stop spinning the globe as soon as the light of the flashlight is
near the mark that represents your town. Compare this to sunrise, when you
just begin to see light in the sky in your town.


- Rotate the globe so the pin/flag representing your town is directly facing the
flashlight. Compare this to twelve o’clock noon, when the sun shines directly
on your town, and is directly overhead in the sky. Then rotate the globe
counterclockwise again, until the light from the flashlight is just past the
mark of your town. Compare this to sunset in your town, when there is only a
little sun left in your view.


- Explain that at sunrise, you were turning the pin/flag representing your town
toward the sun, so the sun started to come into the view of your town. Explain
that at sunset, you were turning the pin/flag representing your town away
from the sun, so the sun was starting to leave the view of your town.


- Then ask students to turn to a neighbor and discuss the following question:
Why does the sun look like it’s moving across the sky from sunrise to sunset?
( _because the earth is moving, spinning or rotating_ )


- Encourage students to share and elaborate upon their responses with unitrelated vocabulary.


Exit Pass


On a piece of paper, have students draw a picture and write a
phrase or sentence describing what causes day and night. For
example, a student might draw a picture of the sun in the sky and
write, “The earth rotating causes day and night.”

specific things that they heard in the read aloud they had heard before.
_(the earth’s rotation)_


  - Model for the students how to use the Read-Aloud to support your answer.
Turn to Image 2A-3 Earth’s Rotation and explain how this part of the ReadAloud supports the answer.


  - Review the previous Read-Aloud, highlighting two ways the earth moves:
rotating on its axis and orbiting around the sun.


  - Place the hoop sun on the floor. Ask students to stand, rotate, spin, and then
orbit the “sun.”


  - Remind students that the earth rotates when it spins on its own axis and that
this spin creates day and night.


  - Encourage students to ask questions that they may have to better
understand the earth’s rotation.

disappear during the day and then reappear at



night. You can see those stars at night because the sun’s light is no longer

shining on your part of the earth, but the stars are always there.


At **dusk**, just after the sun has set in the west but before all of its light has

faded, the first stars of night appear. ~~_It is dusk in this image._~~ The darker it is,

the more stars you can see. If you live in the city, then you can’t see as many

stars as people who live in the country can see. Lights in the cities brighten

the night sky and make it difficult to see the stars. Out in the country—and

especially out in the wilderness far away from buildings, street lights, and

cars—the night sky seems to explode with glittery, twinkling stars.

They may look small, but many of those stars

that you see ~~_[Point to a few stars.]_~~ are actually

incredibly large. Many stars are larger than

our own sun, which, as you may remember, is

big enough to fit a million Earths inside. The

stars look small because they are so far away.

~~_Everything looks smaller when it is far away._~~



Support


Show students Poster 2M.
In the Read-Aloud, the

spacecraft. The word _ship_
can also mean a large boat
or it can mean to send a
package through the mail.


**40**



~~_Think of how small an airplane looks when it is high up in the sky._~~ And the

stars look like they’re blinking, but they’re actually shining steadily. The

gases in our atmosphere cause their light to look like it is twinkling.


Just how far away are the stars? Here’s one way to think about it: if someone

put you on the fastest rocket ship today and launched you out into space,

it would take you thousands of years—about seventy-three thousand to be

exact—to reach the nearest star beyond our sun! That’s pretty far away.

However, you can still see the light from that massive, hot star, even though it

looks more like a tiny, twinkling diamond from here on the earth.


**Show Image 3A-3: Observatory**

At night, astronomers study the stars.

Astronomers work in observatories, which are

buildings where large **telescopes** are housed.

~~_Telescopes are tube-like tools with lenses and_~~

~~_mirrors used for magnifying objects in space_~~





~~_in order to observe them._~~ Observatories are

built high up on hills or mountaintops, where



there are no buildings or trees blocking the telescope. ~~_What smaller word do_~~

But you don’t need a massive telescope and

wonders of stargazing, or looking at the stars.

If you want to get a better look at the stars or

a closer look at the moon, a pair of binoculars

will do the trick. ~~_[Hold your hands to your eyes_~~

~~_because it would only take a few months to get there, we wouldn’t want to_~~

~~_do that because the sun is far too hot._~~ Astronomers have learned that some

stars are older than other stars. Some stars are hotter than others. Some

appear red through the telescope ~~_[Point to the red star on the left.]_~~ and

others appear blue. ~~_[Point to the blue star on the right.]_~~ Stars change color

depending on how hot they are, and how hot a star is depends on its age,

size, and other factors.

A meteor is a rock that flies through space and

enters Earth’s atmosphere, creating a bright

light as it does so. The light appears as a streak



in the sky before it disappears in the blink of an eye. At first glance, a meteor

may look like a star is literally falling through the sky. However, stars do not

move like that. Meteors—although they are sometimes called “shooting

stars”—are not stars at all. ~~_So if you see a shooting star, what are you really_~~

~~_seeing?_~~ ~~(the light of a rock burning up in earth’s atmosphere)~~


**Show Image 3A-8: Close-up of rock hitting**

**Earth’s atmosphere**

There are billions of rocks and other **debris** in

outer space. Some are quite large, but most

are tiny, between the size of a grain of sand

and a baseball. ~~_When rocks break in space, all_~~





~~_the broken pieces, or debris, just move around_~~

~~_together because there isn’t enough gravity for_~~



~~_them to fall anywhere._~~


These rocks and debris are whizzing around all over the place in outer space.

Occasionally, one crashes toward Earth. Before it can hit Earth’s surface,

however, it crashes into Earth’s atmosphere. For a space rock, hitting the

earth’s atmosphere is like a person running into a brick wall, except the

atmosphere doesn’t stop it. The rock or debris hits the atmosphere at

an incredible speed and keeps moving through. As it does so, it creates

intense heat. The rock burns up as it enters the uppermost parts of Earth’s

atmosphere, creating a streak of light—a meteor, or a “shooting star” as

some people call it. ~~_If meteors occur all the time, why do we only see them_~~

~~_at night?_~~


**Show Image 3A-9: Recovered meteorite**

Occasionally, bits and pieces of rock survive

their trip through the atmosphere and fall to

Earth. This is rare, but it does happen from time

to time, and it is possible to find pieces of them

on the ground. When part of a rock or debris





survives the trip through the atmosphere and

lands on Earth, it is called a meteorite. ~~_[Point to_~~



**42**



~~_the meteorite in the image.]_~~


The meteorite in this picture is probably not the most exciting rock you

have ever seen, but it is pretty amazing to think that it came from outer

space. Sometimes, by studying meteorites, scientists discover new types

of rock that do not exist on Earth! ~~_You will learn more about rocks in the_~~

~~_next unit._~~


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


**Show Image 3A-10: Star cluster**

Outer space is a strange and wonderful place.

By studying the stars, planets, and other

objects in space, astronomers have learned

many things about this incredible **universe**,

of which we and our planet Earth are but a

teeny, tiny part. ~~_The universe is everything in_~~

~~_space taken together, including planets, stars,_~~



~~_and space itself._~~ Feast your eyes on this massive star cluster ~~_or group_~~ for

a moment and imagine, if you can, the incredible number of stars and the

incredible distances between us and them, and how much there is for us to

learn about our universe. For instance, look at the very center of this photo.

There in the middle is a little cluster of fourteen bluish stars. Added together,

astronomers estimate that these fourteen stars combined are over 20,000

times larger than our sun! ~~_And remember, our sun is a million times bigger_~~

~~_than the whole planet Earth._~~ That’s so huge, it’s hard to think about, and

that’s just fourteen stars out of all the stars in this photo!


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


As students answer the following questions, add relevant information to the
Idea Web for stars.


1. **Inferential.** When we look up at the stars at night, they look like they are
blinking and they look tiny. Are stars actually tiny and blinking? ( _no_ ) Why do
they look like they’re blinking? ( _Gases in our atmosphere cause stars to look_
_like they are twinkling._ ) Why do they look tiny? ( _They are really far away._ )


2. **Literal.** Stargazers stand outside and look up at the stars, sometimes using
binoculars. Astronomers have special buildings they go to in order to study
the stars. What are these buildings called? ( _observatories_ ) What tools do
astronomers use to see the stars more clearly? ( _telescopes_ )


**Show Image 3A-6: Magnified stars**


3. **Literal.** We learned that not all stars are the same. Why are some stars blue
and some stars red? ( _Some are hotter than others because of their age, size,_
_and other factors._ )

Challenge


What makes a meteorite
different from a meteor? _(A_
_meteorite has entered the_
_atmosphere and landed on_
_Earth; a meteor burns up in_
_Earth’s atmosphere before_
_it has a chance to land.)_


**44**



Check for Understanding


**Idea Web:** What can we add to the Idea Web to describe stars?
_(Answers may vary, but may include that they are very large, far_
_away, different colors, made of superheated gas, appear to us at_
_dusk/night, can be seen close up with telescopes, etc.)_


4. **Literal.** If you look up in the sky at night, you might see a streak of light,
sometimes called a “shooting star.” Is it actually a star? ( _no_ ) Do any stars fall
through the sky? ( _no_ ) What are you probably really seeing? ( _a meteor_ )

   - **Literal.** What is a meteor? ( _a rock that flies through space_ ) What happens
to meteors when they hit the earth’s atmosphere? ( _They usually burn up_
_completely._ )


5. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ People who lived thousands of years ago
didn’t have telescopes or books about stars, so all they knew about stars
was what they could see outside at night. Imagine that you could travel back
in time thousands of years and tell these people that the sun is actually a
star. Do you think they would believe you? ( _probably not_ ) Why or why not?
( _Answers may vary, but may include that the stars look so small compared to_
_the sun, and the stars come out at night, whereas the sun comes out during_
_the day._ )


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


~~**WORD WORK: DUSK (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “At dusk, just after the sun has set in the west
but before all of its light has faded, the first stars of night appear.”


2. Say the word _dusk_ with me.


3. Dusk is the time of day just after sunset, when the sky is not yet as dark as it
will be.


4. The sky glows with the colors of sunset at dusk, when the day ends and the
night begins.


5. What do you usually do at dusk? Try to use the word _dusk_ when you tell
about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the
students’ responses: “At dusk I usually . . . ”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use an Antonyms activity for follow-up.** We know that dusk is the time
when the sun is going down and day turns into night. The opposite of dusk,
or its antonym, is dawn, the time when the sun is coming up and night turns
into day. Listen to the following examples. If I am describing something that
would be going on in the sky at dusk, say, “That happens at dusk.” If I am
describing something that would be going on in the sky at dawn, say, “That
happens at dawn.”


   - The sun sets. ( _That happens at dusk._ )


   - The sun rises. ( _That happens at dawn._ )


   - The stars fade. ( _That happens at dawn._ )


   - The stars appear brighter. ( _That happens at dusk._ )


   - The moon rises. ( _That happens at dusk._ )

  - Tell students that for thousands of years, people have been stargazing, looking
up and wondering about the same stars that you can also see every night.
Explain that, perhaps because the stars are so far away and there are so many
of them, or perhaps because they make the night so beautiful, the stars have
inspired people to imagine and dream as they gaze at the night sky.


  - Explain that students have listened to a nonfiction, or true, Read-Aloud to
learn facts about stars. Tell them that now they will listen to imaginative
poems about stars.


  - Discuss how a poem is different from a story. Explain that in addition to
colorful descriptive language, a poem has rhythm, and sometimes it contains
words that rhyme, repeat, or begin with the same sound or letter.


  - Show students the “Star Light, Star Bright” nursery rhyme you prepared.


  - Ask students if they have heard this poem before.


  - Tell students you will read the whole nursery rhyme while they listen and
watch as you point to each word. Then you will repeat the first line and point
to each word as you read it. You will stop and give students a chance to echo
the words while you point to them again. Tell students you will continue doing
this for each line of the rhyme.

_Star light, star bright_
_First star I see tonight_
_I wish I may, I wish I might_
_Have the wish I wish tonight._

Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


  - Explain to students that like many poems, this poem contains words that
rhyme, or begin with the same sound. Repeat the word _light_, emphasizing the
long /i/ sound. Ask students to raise their hands every time they hear a word
that contains the same /i/ sound as light. Reread the poem slowly, giving
students an opportunity to listen, think, and respond. Then review the words
that rhyme with light. _(light, bright, tonight, might)_


  - Next point out the repetition of the words _star_ and _wish_ in the poem. Explain
that like rhyming words, repeating words in a poem helps give the poem a
rhythm, and this is called repetition. Demonstrate by rereading the poem,
this time clapping your hands in rhythm, every time either the word _star_ or
_wish_ appears.


  - Then ask students if they know any songs about stars. Take a few responses,
and if “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” does not get mentioned, bring it up.


  - Explain that the words from “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” actually come from
a poem written over two hundred years ago (in 1806) by a woman who liked
to gaze at the stars. The name of the poem was “The Star,” and the woman’s
name was Jane Taylor.


  - Explain that the poem is a lot longer than the song they know.


  - Read the poem aloud, encouraging students to listen carefully for words that
rhyme, repeat, and sound the same.


_Twinkle, twinkle, little star,_
_How I wonder what you are!_
_Up above the world so high,_
_Like a diamond in the sky._


_When the blazing sun is gone,_
_When he nothing shines upon,_
_Then you show your little light,_
_Twinkle, twinkle, all the night._


_Then the traveler in the dark,_
_Thanks you for your tiny spark,_
_He could not see which way to go,_
_If you did not twinkle so._


_In the dark blue sky you keep,_
_And often through my curtains peep,_
_For you never shut your eye,_
_Till the sun is in the sky._


_’Tis your bright and tiny spark,_
_Lights the traveler in the dark:_

Support


Some students may
benefit from using the
modified Astronomy
Journal prompts on
Activity Page 3.1. If
students have difficulty
thinking of comparisons,
refer to the Idea Web for
stars and the poems, and
ask students: What can
you see when you look in
the sky at dusk or dark?
What did you learn from
the Read-Aloud “Stars”?
What have people learned
about stars recently?
What did the poems have
to say about stars?



_Though I know not what you are,_
_Twinkle, twinkle, little star._


 - Explain that in addition to using words that rhyme and repeat to create a
poem’s rhythm, poets often put two or more words together that start with
the same letter, and that this is called alliteration. Reread the first stanza of the
poem, emphasizing the words _wonder_ and _what_ . Point out that both of these
words start with the same sound. ~~**TEKS 1.9.B**~~


 - Repeat the line “How I wonder what you are.” Explain that over two hundred
years ago, most people, with the exception of astronomers, really didn’t know
much about what stars were. Stargazers from long ago only knew what they
could see with their own eyes: that stars were tiny, that they covered the
night sky, and that they twinkled. Everything else they had to imagine.


 - Ask students what words and phrases are used to describe stars in these
poems. _(Answers may vary, but may include bright, twinkle, in the sky, comes_
_out when the sun is gone, etc.)_


 - Ask students to consider these descriptions and what they have learned
about stars in the Read-Aloud, referencing the Idea Web for stars. How does
this compare to what the poets wrote about stars? What is similar? What is
different? _(Answers will vary, but may include that stars are bright; they don’t_
_actually twinkle; they are part of outer space, not Earth’s atmosphere; they are_
_always there but we can only see them at night; etc.)_

~~_or objects found in space_~~ The **ancient** Greeks,



Arabs, Romans, Chinese, Egyptians, Turks, Mayans, Babylonians, and

thousands of years have passed on Earth, the stars have basically remained

the same. In other words, when you look up at the stars at night, you are

seeing very nearly the same stars the ancient Greeks, Arabs, and countless

others saw, as well! ~~_Outer space has changed very little in all those years!_~~


**Show Image 4A-3: Constellation in the**

**night sky**

The **ancient** Greeks believed that the stars had

been placed in the sky by mythical gods in order

to tell stories and teach lessons. The Greeks

identified certain groups of stars in the night





sky that seem to form specific shapes. These

shapes are called **constellations** . ~~_That’s the_~~



~~_name for the pictures they saw in the stars._~~ In the United States, Europe, and

many other parts of the world, we still call the stars by the names that the

ancient Greeks or Arabs used so long ago.


**Show Image 4A-4: Big Dipper**

~~_[The Big Dipper is not actually a constellation in_~~
~~_itself but part of a larger constellation called Big_~~
~~_Bear. That is why it is referred to as a “group of_~~
~~_stars” in this Read-Aloud.]_~~





One of the first groups of stars that young

stargazers in the United States learn about is

also the easiest one to spot. The Big Dipper



looks like a giant soup ladle up in the sky. ~~_You might also think it looks like a_~~

~~_pot with a handle. What does it look like to you?_~~ The Big Dipper is made up of

seven stars. The Big Dipper looks different in the sky depending on the time

of year. ~~_[Rotate the Flip Book as you read the following sentence.]_~~ Sometimes

the Big Dipper looks right side up, sometimes it looks upside down, and

sometimes it appears to be standing on its handle! That is not because the


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


Big Dipper moves, but because the earth is rotating on its axis and orbiting

around the sun.


**Show Image 4A-5: Little Dipper**

The Big Dipper has a friend called the Little

Dipper. The Little Dipper also contains seven

stars. The bright star at the end of the handle

is special. It is called Polaris, or the North Star.

Unlike other celestial bodies, the North Star

basically stays in the same place in the sky as

we observe it from Earth—always in the north.


**Show Image 4A-6: Columbus navigating sailing**

**ship**

Since ancient times, people have relied on this

star to find their way in the world. Knowing

which way is north is the first step to figuring

out in which direction you are heading.





Christopher Columbus and other sailors used to

look for the North Star on starry nights out on



the wide ocean. ~~_Because Polaris is always in the north sky, Columbus could_~~

~~_use it like a compass to navigate his ships north, south, east, or west._~~


**Show Image 4A-7: Orion**

This picture shows one of the most famous

constellations of all: Orion. Ancient Greeks

told stories, or **myths**, about Orion, a famous

hunter. ~~_Myths are stories from ancient times_~~

~~_that explain events or things in nature. What_~~





~~_other myths have you heard this year?_~~ The

constellation Orion is known all over the world.



The constellation itself contains eight main stars. Orion’s Belt, made up of

the three stars in a row across his body, is the easiest to spot. As you can

see, it takes a little imagination to look at these stars and see a hunter. The

single star in the upper left is imagined to be the beginning of a raised arm,

which is holding a club or a sword. With his other arm, imagined to extend

from another single star, he holds a shield. ~~_[Point to the three stars on the_~~

fighting the bull Taurus. So, according to the

myths, Orion has a tough time up there: he is

being chased by a giant scorpion at the same



time he is fighting a giant bull!


Fortunately, Orion has a couple of friends: his two loyal hunting dogs, Canis

Major and Canis Minor. ~~_These are Latin words._~~ ~~Canis~~ ~~_means dog,_~~ ~~major~~

~~_means big, and_~~ ~~minor~~ ~~_means small. So what does Canis Major mean?_~~ ~~(big~~

**Show Image 4A-10: Constellation chart**

There are eighty-eight major constellations,

and most people around the world use the

same basic list. When these constellations were

first named, most ancient people could only

guess what stars actually were. Ancient people





told stories and myths based on what they

could see with their own eyes when they looked



up at the sky. But we have learned that there is much more to space than

meets the eye. In fact, sometimes when we look into outer space, our eyes

can play tricks on us.


The first astronomers began using mathematics and science to provide

different kinds of explanations than the myths that ancient people told to


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


describe what they saw in the sky. Rather than make up stories, astronomers

developed hypotheses, or scientific explanations, based on facts they

discovered about outer space. ~~_A hypothesis is different from a story because_~~

~~_a hypothesis can be tested._~~


**Show Image 4A-11: Copernicus with model of**
**Earth, showing it revolving around sun**

For example, ancient people saw that the sun

rose on one side of the sky in the morning

and set on the other side of the sky in the

evening. Seeing the sun’s “movement” across





the sky caused ancient people to believe that

the sun moved while the earth stood still.



Ancient Greeks and Arabs and, in fact, most people in the world, believed

that everything in the universe—including the sun and all the stars—revolved

around the earth. It took thousands of years before anyone believed that

the opposite was true, that the earth in fact revolved around the sun. ~~_Do you_~~

~~_remember how we orbited the plastic hoop sun?_~~ This discovery was made by

an early astronomer named Nicolaus Copernicus.


Copernicus was the first to use science to explain that Earth actually

revolves around the sun. Unfortunately, hardly anyone believed him at the

time. That was about 500 years ago.


**Show Image 4A-12: Galileo with telescope**

Another astronomer named Galileo came

after Copernicus, and he believed what

Copernicus said about the earth revolving

around the sun. He invented telescopes that

helped astronomers prove that Copernicus’s

to be the father of modern astronomy.


Lesson 4 Stargazing and Constellations

**Show Image 4A-13: Modern telescope**

Since the time of these early astronomers,

people have gained an incredible amount of

knowledge about the stars and the universe

and now use tools like telescopes to expand

that knowledge each day. Copernicus and

Galileo would be amazed by the **advances** ~~_or_~~

~~_progress_~~ people have made in astronomy over



the past century. Compare this incredibly large modern telescope to the

one Galileo was holding in the last picture. ~~_[Point to the telescope, and flip_~~

~~_about these two telescopes?_~~ ~~(one is much larger) A~~ stronomers today use

telescopes like this one to study the stars and other distant parts of outer

space that Galileo may have never imagined.


**Show Image 4A-14: Constellation chart**

Yet even as we have gained new knowledge

about outer space, our understanding of

the stars is still built upon the stories and

knowledge passed on by people for thousands

of years. Next time you find a constellation in





the sky, you will know that other stargazers

have been studying and telling stories about

that same group of stars for thousands and

thousands of years.

**Hit the Nail on the Head**

  - Ask students if they have ever heard the saying “hit the nail on the head.”
Have students repeat the saying.


  - Write the saying on a chalkboard, a piece of chart paper, or a whiteboard.


  - Repeat the saying and ask students what tool you usually use to hit a nail.
_(hammer)_ Then explain that the flat top of the nail is called the head. Draw
a quick sketch of a nail on chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard, and
point out the head.


  - Explain that the words of the saying mean that when you are hammering,
you’re supposed to hit the nail on the head. Hitting the nail in another spot
won’t work; the only way to get it right and drive the nail into a piece of wood
is to hit the nail on the head.


  - Explain to students that people have used this saying for years, not just to
describe hammering, but to describe people who have said something that is
right or who have made the right conclusion and didn’t miss the point.


  - Remind students that Copernicus was the first astronomer to prove that the
sun does not revolve around the earth; rather, the earth revolves around the
sun. Explain that he got it right, even though no one believed him at the time and
even though it would be years before other astronomers would agree with him.

 - Then tell the students that instead of saying that Copernicus got it right, we
can say that Copernicus “hit the nail on the head.” Copernicus hit the nail on
the head when he said that the earth orbits the sun, because he got it right.

**One-Word Answer:** Listen as I tell you a short little story about
two people. When I am done, tell me which person gets it right
when he or she talks, hitting the nail on the head.


_Joe and Mary stand in their backyard one night and both look up at_
_the stars. Joe says, “The stars are so tiny!” Mary says, “Actually,_
_the stars are huge; they’re just really far away.”_


One of these children got it right when describing the stars. Who hit
the nail on the head: Joe or Mary? _(Mary)_

_(Big Dipper, Little Dipper, Orion, Scorpio, Taurus, Canis Major, and Canis Minor)_


 - Remind students that these constellations were identified by ancient people
who could only look at the stars without anything else to help them see the
stars more clearly. Then ask them the name of the tool astronomers look
through to magnify stars, or make them appear larger. _(telescope)_


**Show Image 3A-6**

 - Explain that sometimes it is hard to believe that the tiny, twinkling stars we
see at night are actually huge balls of superheated gas, like our sun.


 - Tell students that today they will work as a class to draw a model of the Big
Dipper, a famous group of stars. However, instead of drawing little dots for
the stars, they will draw each of the seven stars in the Big Dipper as if they
saw it through a telescope, like a real astronomer might see it, just like what
they see in this image.

- Divide students into the groups you prepared in advance, and give each
group a large piece of chart paper.


- Encouraging the use of image 3A-6 as a model, have each group work
together to draw and cut out one large star from their piece of chart paper.
Remind students that stars can be red or blue and are not solid, but gaseous.


- Before they begin, tell students that asking questions is one way to make
sure that everyone knows what to do. Have students repeat the directions
and then think of a question to ask their neighbor about the directions. For
example, a student could ask, “What should we do first?” Tell students to
turn to their neighbor, and ask their question now. Call on several students to
share their questions with the class.


- As students work, circulate around the room. Ask groups to describe their
stars and encourage the use of unit-related vocabulary.


- When all the stars have been cut out, tell students that you will use the image
of the Big Dipper from the Flip Book to create a huge model of the Big Dipper,
using the magnified stars they drew and cut out.


- Use as large a floor space as you have available to replicate the shape of the
Big Dipper as shown in image 4A-4.


- Encourage students to look for the Big Dipper in the night sky the next time
they are able to stargaze. Remind students to think about just how large
those stars are the next time they see tiny little lights in the night sky.


Exit Pass


      - In their journals, have students record, in one to three sentences,

**Show Image 5A-1: View of Earth and moon**

Earth’s closest celestial neighbor is featured in

this photograph. What is this famous celestial

body called? It’s the moon. ~~_Describe what you_~~

~~_see in the picture. How does the moon look?_~~





People have been looking at the moon and

wondering about it for thousands and thousands

of years, and they have invented all kinds of



stories about it. Some ancient myths explain that the moon was the sun’s

sister. Other people said the moon was a giant face looking down on Earth.

Some children’s stories even said that the moon was made of cheese! ~~_Why_~~

~~_do you think people had these ideas about the moon?_~~


In fact, the moon is basically just a big, cold, dark rock. You heard it right:

although the moon sometimes appears to be shiny and bright in the night

sky, the moon does not produce any light of its own. It is not a star, like the

sun, but just a rock. ~~_So even though it looks like light is shining brightly from_~~


**TEKS 1.6.G** Evaluate details to determine what is important with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.7.C** Use text evidence to support

Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


~~_the moon, it is not; our eyes are playing tricks on us!_~~ The light you see when

you look at the moon is actually light from the sun **reflecting** ~~_or bouncing_~~ off

it. ~~_[Point to the moon in the illustration.] So where is this light coming from?_~~


**Show Image 5A-2: Diagram of moon orbiting**

**Earth**

While the earth orbits or revolves around the

sun, the moon orbits or revolves around the

earth. Do you remember how long it takes for

earth to orbit, or go all the way around, the





sun? ~~_[Pause for responses.]_~~ It takes about 365

days, or one year. Can you guess how long it



takes for the moon to orbit Earth? ~~_[Pause for responses.]_~~


It takes a little more than twenty-seven days, or about a month, for the moon

to make a complete trip around the earth. But the moon also rotates on its

axis as it orbits Earth. ~~_So the moon rotates on its axis and orbits the earth_~~

~~_just like the earth rotates on its axis and orbits the sun._~~ In fact, the moon

rotates exactly once as it orbits Earth exactly once. This remarkable feature

keeps the same side of the moon always facing Earth. That means we never

see the back of the moon when we look up in the sky.


The **appearance** of the moon ~~_or the way it looks to us on Earth_~~ changes

depending on where it is in its orbit. Follow the arrows in this diagram and

you can see that the moon orbits Earth in a **counterclockwise** motion.

~~_Counterclockwise is this direction. [Trace your finger along the orbit.]_~~ The sun

is over on the right-hand side of this diagram.


**Show Image 5A-3: Lunar phases**

This image gives you a better idea of what the

moon really looks like during each of its phases.







During the first half of its orbit, the moon is said

to be waxing, meaning that, over the course of

several nights, more and more of it becomes

visible from Earth. Then, halfway through its

cycle, the full moon appears, meaning that the







side facing the earth is also facing the light of the sun.


As the moon completes the last half of its orbit, less and less of it is visible

each night. During this time we say that the moon is waning; less of the moon


Lesson 5 The Moon

is seen. By the time it completes its cycle, it appears as little more than a

shiny sliver of light in the sky.


On other nights, it looks like there is no moon at all! Remember how the

moon does not make any light of its own? Well, sometimes the moon is

between the sun and the earth, and the side of the moon facing the earth

does not reflect any sunlight. When this happens, the side of the moon facing

the earth is dark, and it looks like there is no moon in the sky.


**Show Image 5A-4: New moon**

This is called a new moon. ~~_So when there’s a_~~

~~_new moon, we can’t actually see it, because no_~~

~~_light is reflecting off the moon toward us._~~ The

moon never looks exactly the same from one

night to the next. The moon does not change its





shape. It is always a big, round rock. Instead,

it only appears to change shape depending on



how sunlight hits the moon during its orbit.


**Show Image 5A-5: Crescent moon**

On certain nights, you can only see a sliver

or small piece of the moon. This is called a

**crescent** moon. ~~_[Trace your finger down the_~~

~~_curve.] See how the crescent shape is curved_~~

~~_like a banana and comes to a point at the ends?_~~







~~_What do we call the moon when it looks like a_~~

~~_thin, curved sliver?_~~


**Show Image 5A-6: Half moon**

On other nights, it looks like someone sliced the

moon in half. ~~_[Drag your finger down the center_~~

~~_line.]_~~ This is called a half moon. ~~_Does the moon_~~

~~_really change shape in the night sky or does_~~

~~_it just look like it changes shape?_~~ Remember,

the moon only looks like it is changing shape.

It is always a big, round rock, but it can look



**74**



different during its orbit depending on how the light reflects off it.


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


**Show Image 5A-7: Full moon**

Halfway through its cycle, the moon looks like

this. This is called a full moon because the full,

round moon is shining brightly in the night sky.

Because it takes only twenty-seven days for

the moon to complete its orbit around Earth,

and most months in the calendar have about

thirty days, it is possible for a full moon to



appear twice in the course of one calendar month every once in a while. ~~_The_~~

~~_few extra days each month add up over time._~~ When this happens, it is called a

“blue moon.” But this is rare; it only happens every few years. So, if you hear

someone say that something only happens “once in a blue moon,” they mean

that it does not happen very often.


Some people say they see what looks like a man’s face when they look at the

full moon. That is why people sometimes talk about the “man in the moon”

as though there really were a face on the moon. Can you see what appears

to be two eyes, a nose, and a mouth on this moon? Of course, in reality, there

is no face on the moon; it’s just a big, round rock. ~~_What do we call the moon_~~

~~_when it looks like a big circle?_~~


**Show Image 5A-8: Moon close-up**

~~_Let’s take a closer look at the moon._~~

People sometimes see what looks like a

man’s face in the moon because of dark areas

on the moon’s surface. ~~_[Point to the dark areas_~~

where, a long time ago, lava from inside of the

moon poured out onto the moon’s surface.



These areas no longer have lava in them, but the holes left behind reflect

sunlight differently than the rest of the moon’s surface. So when you look

up at a full moon, you can see some of the deep and dark holes across the

moon’s surface.


When you take a close-up look, you can see that the moon’s surface is also

covered with hundreds and thousands of **craters** ~~_or big holes_~~ . To understand

why these craters are there, you need to know a few more facts about the

moon. Unlike Earth, the moon has no atmosphere. There is not a protective

bubble of air around the moon, nor does the moon have any water, soil,

plants, or any other signs of life whatsoever.


Lesson 5 The Moon

**Show Image 5A-9: Close-up of large craters**

Without an atmosphere, the moon has nothing

to protect it from all the rocks and debris that

zoom through outer space. These strike Earth

all the time, but when they hit the atmosphere,

most of them burn up in a streak of light

known as a meteor. ~~_What do some people call_~~

however, do not burn up when they hit the moon. They just crash right into

the moon’s surface and leave what are known as impact craters. ~~_An impact is_~~

~~_a crash._~~


In a later Read-Aloud, you will learn the amazing, true story about real men

on the moon—not just lava lakes that look like a man’s face, but actual men

who traveled to the moon and walked around on it. ~~_Do you know what we call_~~

about the moon? Turn to a partner and tell one. Then respond to
your partner by explaining why the moon appears this way. Make
sure to cite specifics from the Read-Aloud to support your answer.

~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


As students answer the following questions, add relevant information to the
Idea Web for the moon.


1. **Literal.** When we look at the moon at night, it looks like it is glowing. Is it
really glowing? ( _no_ ) Why does the moon look lit up? ( _It reflects the light from_
_the sun._ )


2. **Literal.** The earth orbits the sun. What does the moon orbit? ( _the earth_ )

   - **Literal.** The earth takes a year to complete its orbit around the sun. About
how long does the moon take to orbit around the earth? ( _a month_ )


**Show Image Cards 3–6**


3. **Literal.** You heard that the appearance of the moon changes throughout its
orbit because more or less of the sun’s light reflects off it. These changes in
the moon’s appearance are called phases. Name each of the phases of the
moon pictured here. [Show students each card and ask them to name the
phase of the moon.]


4. **Literal.** Many people have said that the moon looks like it has a face, and
there are many stories about the “man in the moon.” What are those dark
spots? ( _lava lakes, or dark areas caused when lava from inside the moon_
_poured onto its surface_ )


5. **Literal.** What happens when meteors hit the moon? ( _They make big holes._ )
What are these holes called? ( _craters_ ) Why isn’t the earth covered with
craters? ( _The earth’s atmosphere burns up most meteors before they hit_
_land._ )


6. **Inferential.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ You heard about some ways that the moon is
not like the earth. The earth’s atmosphere supports the plants and animals
that live on Earth. Is there life (any plants or animals) on the moon? ( _no_ ) Why
not? ( _The moon doesn’t have an atmosphere._ )

~~**WORD WORK: COUNTERCLOCKWISE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In today’s Read-Aloud you heard, “Follow the arrows in this diagram and you
can see that the moon orbits Earth in a counterclockwise motion.”


2. [Motion with your finger in a counterclockwise direction.] Say the word
_counterclockwise_ with me.


3. Counterclockwise is moving in a circle to the left, which is the opposite
direction of the way the hands of a clock move.


4. The moon orbits the earth in a counterclockwise direction. Earth orbits the
sun in a counterclockwise direction.


5. [Show students a learning clock.] Using this clock, who can make the minute
hand of this clock move counterclockwise? What are the two things we
learned about that have a counterclockwise orbit? ( _the moon, Earth_ )


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Movement activity for follow-up.** [Have students form a circle.] We
will now play a game called “Clockwise/Counterclockwise.” Remember that
clockwise means moving in the same direction as the hands on a clock would
move. [Have students move, staying in a circle, in a clockwise direction.]
Counterclockwise means moving in the opposite direction as the hands on
a clock. [Have students move in a counterclockwise direction around the
circle.] I am going to say “clockwise” or “counterclockwise,” and then you
move in that direction.

**Language:** Students will practice using the conjunction _because_ .

~~**TEKS 1.1.A**~~


**Reading:** Students will identify the four phases of the moon.

~~**TEKS 1.7.E**~~


~~**SYNTACTIC AWARENESS ACTIVITY (5 MIN.)**~~


**Conjunction Because**

  - Tell students conjunctions, or linking words, are used to connect words and
phrases. We use the word _because_ to join two parts of a sentence. One part
tells us what happened and the other part tells us why something happened,
or the cause.


  - Tell students to listen carefully as you reread a part of the Read-Aloud and
emphasize the word _because_ as you read:


_This is called a full moon because the full, round moon is shining_
_brightly in the night sky._


  - Tell students that in this sentence the word _because_ tells us why this is
called a full moon. _(This is called a full moon because the full, round moon is_
_shining.)_


  - Tell students the word _because_ tells us the cause, or the reason for
something. Give students another example.


_Pedro’s mom had to drive him to school because he missed the bus._


  - Ask students why Pedro’s mother had to drive him to school. _(Pedro’s mom_
_had to drive him to school because he missed the bus.)_


  - Ask students which word tells why something happened. _(because)_ Give
students another example _:_


_We had no school today because it snowed._


  - Ask students why there was no school today. _(because it snowed)_


**TEKS 1.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and answer questions using multi-word responses;
**TEKS 1.7.E** Interact with sources in meaningful ways such as illustrating or writing.

~~**PHASES OF THE MOON (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image Cards 3–6**

 - Review the following phases of the moon with students: new moon, crescent
moon, half moon, and full moon. Point out that as the moon is waxing, more
of it becomes visible. As the moon is waning, less of it becomes visible.


 - Tell students that from our view on Earth, the moon goes through these
phases in a cycle.


 - Ask students if they know what a cycle is. Tell students a cycle is when
something repeats, or happens over and over again in the same order. So the
moon goes through each phase in the same order over and over.


 - Ask students what shape the moon is during each of its phases. ( _sliver/_
_crescent moon, half circle/half moon, circle/full moon)_


 - Tell students they will create their own moon dial. Explain that a dial is
something that is moveable and shows information on its front side. Their
moon dial will show the different phases of the moon.


 - Have students cut out the two circles for their dial on Activity Page 5.1.
If necessary, help them paste the circles on card stock. Be sure that a
triangular shape is cut out from the top circle.


 - Have students write their name on the dial. You may also have them decorate
the top circle.


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration

- Have students cut out the six images showing the phases of the moon and
place them in order. Tell students they will first show the moon waxing, so
the first half will have the right side of the moon showing. Then after the full
moon they will show the moon waning, so the second half will have the left
side of the moon showing.


- Once students have the images in the correct order, have them paste the
images onto the bottom circle of the dial.


- Finally, help students poke a hole through the circles and insert the brad.


- Have students use their moon dial by moving their dial in a counterclockwise
direction to walk through the phases of the moon with their partner.

sun looks like it rises and sets each day because the earth is rotating.


 - Sometimes I look like a circle, and other times I look like half a circle or even
just a sliver in the sky. _(moon)_


**Sequencing the Moon’s Phases**

 - Remind students that they learned that we can see different amounts of the
moon depending on where it is in orbit and how much sunlight is reflecting
off it.


 - Remind students that the moon has four phases: new, crescent, half, and full.
Then have four volunteers act out the phases of the moon.


 - For a new moon, have a student hold their arms close to their body. For a
crescent moon, have a second student put their arms overhead with elbows
close together. For a half moon, have another student put one arm straight
up and meet it with the other curved arm, reducing the space between the
two arms to half. For a full moon, have a fourth student make a large circle
with their arms overhead.


 - Encourage students in the “audience” to use their moon dials to identify what
phases the volunteers are acting out.


**Day and Year Game**

 - On the playground or in a large indoor space, tell students you will play a game
to practice the two ways Earth moves relative to the sun: rotating and orbiting.


 - Remind students that Earth’s rotation on its axis creates day and night, and
Earth’s orbit around the sun creates our year.


 - Stand in the center of the space. Tell students that you are pretending to be
the sun and they are each going to pretend to be Earth.


 - When you say “day,” they are to spin around in place, counterclockwise,
pretending to rotate like Earth does every twenty-four hours.

**Relative Sizes of Sun and Earth**


Materials: Large sheet of yellow paper (bulletin board or butcher paper);
chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard

 - Remind students that the sun is much, much bigger than Earth.


 - Draw a circle on chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard, and draw a
diameter across its center. Explain that this line is called a diameter.


 - Tell students that a diameter is the width of a circle measured by a straight
line. Explain that the diameter, or width, of the sun is 110 times bigger than
the diameter of the earth. Tell students that you will make a picture of the
earth and of the sun in order to appreciate how much larger the sun is
compared to Earth.


 - Make a circle one-half inch in diameter. Tell students that this represents
Earth.


 - Then using a large sheet of yellow paper, make a circle that is four and a half
feet in diameter. Tell students that this represents the sun.


**More Constellations**


Materials: Star stickers

 - Using a constellation chart as a guide, affix star stickers in the shapes of
various constellations on the ceiling or on the underside of a large table in
your classroom.


 - Go “stargazing” with students, and see how many constellations they can
recognize.


**On Stage: Stargazers and Astronomers**

 - Divide students into two groups: a group of astronomers, and a group of
stargazers. Tell each group that you will give them a time of day. First, the
stargazers will pretend to look up in the sky and describe exactly what they
would see at that time of day. Then the astronomers will look through their
pretend telescopes and explain to the stargazers what is really happening in
space.


1. **noon**

Stargazers: The sun is right over our heads.
Astronomers: Our side of Earth is facing the sun.


2. **night**

Stargazers: The sun is gone and the moon is out.
Astronomers: Our side of Earth is facing away from the sun.


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


3. **sunrise**

Stargazers: The sun is coming up; there are colors in the sky.
Astronomers: We are rotating toward the sun.


4. **sunset**

Stargazers: The sun is setting; there are colors in the sky.
Astronomers: We are rotating away from the sun.


**Vocabulary Instructional Activity**
**Horizontal Word Wall: Major/Minor**


Materials: long horizontal chart paper; words written on index cards: _major,_
_minor, big, important, giant, small, unimportant, tiny_

  - In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Fortunately, Orion has a couple of friends: his
two loyal hunting dogs, Canis Major and Canis Minor.”


  - Say the word _major_ with me. Say the word _minor_ with me.


  - _Major_ refers to something that is large or that means a lot. _Minor_ refers to
something that is little or something people don’t really care about as much.


  - Tell students they will make a Horizontal Word Wall for the words _major_
and _minor_ . Emphasize to students that you will be placing words on the
Horizontal Word Wall, but they are not expected to be able to read the words
because they are still learning all the rules for decoding. Emphasize that you
are writing the words so that you don’t forget them and that you will read the
words to students.


  - Place _minor_ on the far left side of the chart and _major_ on the far right of the
chart. Now hold up, individually, each of the other word cards ( _big_, _important_,
_giant_, _small_, _unimportant_, _tiny_ ) in random order, read the word to students,
and then have student volunteers place each of the cards on the line near
_major_ or _minor_, depending on which word has a more similar meaning to the
new word. Provide real-world examples of the words, such as “I have a major
pain in my leg.” “I have a minor pain in my leg.” or “Students spend a major
part of their day in a classroom.” “Students spend a minor part of their day in
the cafeteria.”


  - Have students talk with their neighbor, using the different words on the
Horizontal Word Wall. Remind students to use complete sentences.

**Earth-Moon Relay**

 - This activity is best completed outdoors or in a large indoor space, such as a
gym. If neither option is feasible, be sure to create a space in your classroom
large enough for students to walk around in a circle. Make five signs that will
be taped to the floor: “sun,” and four blank cards. Put the sun sign down in
the center of the space, and put the four blank cards on the floor in a circle,
or if space permits, an ellipse. The floor should look like this:


 - Tell students that they have learned a lot about how the earth and the moon
move in space. Announce that they will get to act out these movements,
playing the roles of the sun, Earth, or moon.


 - First, ask for two volunteers to stand back to back in the center of the circle,
holding a hula hoop over both of them to act as the sun. Remind students
that the sun is huge, which is why you want to use a hula hoop and more than
one student. Also remind students that the sun doesn’t orbit and that they
need to stand stationary on the sign.


**Step 1: Earth orbits sun**


 - Remind students that the earth orbits, or revolves, around the sun. Hold
up the globe and tell students that it represents the earth. Ask for four
volunteers to carry the globe around the sun. Explain that, because you want
to give everyone a turn, you will do this activity as a relay. Define _relay_ for
them by saying, “In a relay, one person goes part of the distance and tags or
passes something to the next person to continue for them. In this relay, we
will pass the earth.”


 - Have each volunteer stand on one of the blank cards. Give the globe to the
student standing on the card nearest to you, and have the student slowly
walk counterclockwise, handing the globe over to the person standing on the


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


next blank sign before stepping out of the circle. Have them continue until
the globe makes one full orbit.


**Step 2: Earth spins and orbits sun**


 - Then remind students that the earth moves in two ways: it orbits, but it also
rotates or spins on its axis. Ask if anyone wants to try orbiting the sun again,
spinning the globe at the same time. Take four new volunteers. You may also
want to choose new volunteers for the sun.


 - Have each volunteer stand on one of the blank cards. Give the globe to the
student standing on the nearest blank card and have the student slowly walk
counterclockwise, spinning the globe at the same time. When the student
reaches the person standing on the next blank card, the student should
carefully hand the globe over and step out of the circle. Have students
continue until the globe makes one full orbit.


**Step 3: Moon orbits Earth**


 - Remind students that, in the Read-Aloud, they heard that the moon orbits
the earth. Remind students that the same side of the moon always faces
the earth. Demonstrate this motion by walking around one student, sidestepping so that your body remains facing them in the center.


 - Then direct students to find a partner to practice the moon’s orbit. Allow
students playing the “sun” to participate in this activity as well. One partner
will play the earth, standing still while the moon walks around the earth.
Remind students that the “moon” will have to step sideways in its orbit so it
can remain facing the earth the whole time.


**Step 4: Moon orbits the earth while the earth orbits the sun**


 - Now remind students that they just practiced the moon’s orbit while the
earth was standing still. However, the earth never stands still. Tell them that
they will now put together all of the movements they’ve practiced.


 - Have some new volunteers stand in the center to play the role of the sun.
Ask four new volunteers to play the role of the earth again as you did in Step
2, walking in an orbit while spinning the globe in relay style. Tell students
that you will play the part of the moon, orbiting the earth while the earth is
orbiting the sun. Making a wide berth around the student holding the globe,
continue orbiting the “earth” as the globe changes hands. Remember to face
the globe at all times.


 - If time permits and students want to try it, have four students play the role of
the moon, orbiting the person who is holding the globe, from one blank card
to the next.



Challenge


Ask how many times the
earth spins as it goes
around the sun once.
Remember, each spin is a
day, and the whole orbit
takes a year.

~~**“HISTORY OF SPACE EXPLORATION AND ASTRONAUTS” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 6A-1: Ladder to the moon**

Ever since they first gazed up at the stars,

people have wondered if it was possible—and

what it would be like—to travel into outer space.

For most of human history, the idea of traveling

into space was considered to be impossible.





Space, most people thought, was out of reach,

and there was no way humans would ever be



able to go there. Still, this did not keep people from using their imaginations

and coming up with creative ideas for space travel.


The Chinese invented the first **rockets** ~~_engines that push things into the_~~

~~_air_~~ hundreds of years ago using the same type of explosive powder used

to fire cannons. Lighting the explosive powder would **launch** the rocket

~~_lifting or pushing it forcefully_~~ into the air. Eventually people thought about

using rockets to go all the way to outer space. It was not until about one

hundred years ago that scientists started to make serious advances in rocket

**technology** ~~_or started to apply the discoveries they made in rocket science._~~

Lesson 6 History of Space Exploration and Astronauts
**95**


**Show Image 6A-2: Rockets** ~~_The rockets you see_~~
~~_here are some of those early rockets incorporating_~~

~~_new technology._~~

By the 1950s, rocket technology had improved

to the point that people began to think

seriously about space travel and exploration.


**Show Image 6A-3: Newspaper about early**

**space travel**

Back then, there was a nation called the Soviet

Union, which no longer exists today, but which

consisted of Russia and other countries near

Russia. ~~_[Point to Russia on a world map or_~~

~~_globe.]_~~ At the time, the United States was the

only other nation in the world as large or as



strong as the Soviet Union. ~~_[Point to the United States on the world map or_~~

~~_globe.]_~~ The leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States each wanted

to show the world that their country was the more powerful country by being

the first to launch a rocket into outer space.


**Show Image 6A-4: Rocket launch**

This photo shows scientists in the United

States launching the first rocket from Cape

Canaveral, Florida, in 1950. This was just a

test to see whether this type of rocket engine

worked. This was the first of hundreds of

rockets to be launched from Cape Canaveral.


**Show Image 6A-5: Sputnik 1**

The Soviet Union succeeded in putting the

first man-made object in orbit on October 4,

1957, by launching a satellite called Sputnik 1. A

satellite is any object that moves in a constant

orbit around another object in space. ~~_Some_~~

~~_satellites teach us about space by taking_~~

~~_photographs._~~


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


Sputnik 1 was carried into space aboard a rocket and then released. ~~_It didn’t_~~

~~_have an engine like a rocket, so it couldn’t get into space by itself._~~ It orbited

Earth for several months before reentering the atmosphere and burning up.

~~_That’s what happens to meteors that hit the earth’s atmosphere, too._~~


After the success of Sputnik 1, the “Space Race” between the United States

and the Soviet Union had begun. ~~_It wasn’t a real race with a start and finish_~~

~~_line, but both countries wanted to be the first to go to space._~~ Each country

wanted to prove that it had a better space program than the other country.

For several years, the Soviet Union continued to lead in the Space Race. The

leaders and people of each country took the Space Race very seriously; it

was not a game, but a true matter of national pride.


**Show Image 6A-6: Explorer launch**

The United States developed a space program

called the National Aeronautics and Space

Administration, or NASA for short. The United

States put NASA’s new spaceflight center in

facility would later be known as the Johnson

Space Center. The scientists at NASA hurried



to try to catch up to the progress the Soviets had made. A few months after

the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, NASA scientists in the United States

launched a satellite of their own, Explorer 1, pictured here. ~~_[Point to the_~~

~~_rocket containing the satellite in image.]_~~


**Show Image 6A-7: Yuri Gagarin**

The Space Race continued at a heated pace

into 1961, ~~_So both countries were trying hard to_~~

~~_win for eleven years._~~ when Soviet Yuri Gagarin

[/yoo*ree/ * /gug* ə r*in/] became the first

person to go into space and return safely. This





picture of Gagarin was taken on the way to the

launch pad for his historic journey. You can bet



that he was feeling very nervous at that point. ~~_Why might he be nervous?_~~


Lesson 6 History of Space Exploration and Astronauts
**97**


**Show Image 6A-8: Alan Shepard**

The Americans were close behind. A couple of

months after Gagarin made his famous flight,

a man named Alan Shepard became the first

American to travel into space. This picture

was taken shortly before Shepard boarded the

Freedom 7 **spacecraft** . ~~_A spacecraft is a vehicle_~~

~~_used for traveling beyond Earth’s atmosphere._~~



Notice that, like Gagarin, Shepard was wearing a helmet and a special suit.

Space travelers need special gear like this in order to survive the extreme

conditions of outer space, where there is no air, and where the temperatures

can be both incredibly hot and incredibly cold. ~~_There’s also air inside the suit_~~

~~_so astronauts can breathe._~~


**Show Image 6A-9: Rescuing Shepard**

Returning from outer space is just as

dangerous as launching into outer space

~~_because you crash into the atmosphere on the_~~

~~_way back, like meteors do_~~ ~~.~~ This photo shows the

Freedom 7, Alan Shepard’s ship, after his flight.





Shepard is inside that little capsule ~~_a small,_~~

~~_closed space that keeps a pilot or astronaut safe_~~



~~_when traveling or landing_~~ ~~!~~ When his flight was finished, the capsule reentered

the atmosphere and a parachute opened to lower it gently to Earth. Shepard

landed in the ocean, as planned, and the capsule floated there until a

helicopter came to recover him.


**Show Image 6A-10: Astronauts training**

Space travelers like Alan Shepard are called

**astronauts** . The word _astronaut_ comes from

two Greek words: _astro_, meaning “star”; and

_naut_, meaning “sail.” So, an astronaut is a “star

sailor” ~~_or a person who is trained to travel_~~





~~_into space_~~ . Although being an astronaut can

certainly be one of the most interesting jobs in

the world, it is by no means an easy job.



**98**



Astronauts spend years in training to prepare for journeys into outer space.

Astronauts must be healthy and strong because space travel can be very

difficult. Astronauts are stuffed into tiny spaces and launched into space in a


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


rocket powered by thousands of gallons of powerful fuel. It is scary and it is

uncomfortable, but astronauts put up with it.


This picture shows astronauts undergoing training. These Apollo 17

astronauts are learning to use equipment for their mission.


Early NASA astronauts also spent hours and hours running in place on

treadmills, soaking their feet in ice water, and undergoing a number of other

difficult, painful tests intended to make them tough. They had to be tough to

be astronauts.

to see who could go to space first. What did we call this competition? ( _the_
_Space Race_ )


2. **Literal.** The Soviet Union was the first country to launch an object into
space: the satellite, Sputnik 1. How did they get it into space? ( _They launched_
_a rocket carrying it._ )


3. **Literal.** The United States wanted to catch up to the Soviet Union, so they
started the NASA program and launched a satellite into space, too. Then both
countries launched something else, even more important, into space. What
did they send next? ( _people; astronauts_ )

~~**UNDERSTANDING PERSUASIVE TEXT (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Explain that a writer may try to convince, or _persuade_, readers to agree with
their opinion. To do this, the writer gives reasons for the opinion. This is called
a persuasive text.


  - For example, a writer might follow up her opinion, “I think dogs are the best
pets.” with more information. For example, she might say, “I think dogs are
the best pets because they are loyal and love to play.”


  - Refer to the statement you prepared in advance. Point out the opinion _(dogs_
_are the best pets)_, the two reasons _(dogs are loyal; dogs love to play)_, and the
conjunction _because_ . Ask students why the author writes that the dogs are
loyal and love to play. ( _Because the writer wants to tell why dogs are the best_
_pets._ ) Explain that this writer is trying to persuade us to think that dogs make
the best pets. ~~**TEKS 1.9.E**~~


  - Next, point to the conjunction _because_ . Ask students to recall what the
conjunction _because_ tells us in a sentence. _(the cause, or the reason for_
_something)_ Explain to students that they will use the word _because_ to explain
the reason for their opinion.


  - Have students take turns sharing their favorite kind of pet and giving two
reasons why. Remind students to use the conjunction _because_ to introduce
the reasons why they like this kind of pet.


  - State the following to students: I would follow my opinion statement “Dogs
are the best pets because they are loyal and love to play” with two pictures—
one of a dog playing and one of a dog fetching a stick. These pictures would
help convince readers that dogs are the best pets. How can pictures help a
writer make a convincing argument? ~~**TEKS 1.10.C**~~


  - Tell students they will write an opinion statement about the Read-Aloud they
heard today. They will include reasons to try to persuade readers to agree
with their opinion.


~~**OPINION WRITING - ASTRONOMY JOURNALS (10 MIN.)**~~

##### Introducing the Read-Aloud


**Speaking and Listening:** Students will describe the experiences of the first
astronauts.


~~**TEKS 1.1.C; TEKS 1.7.A**~~


~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED? (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Review the previous Read-Aloud about space exploration and the first
astronauts by asking students the following questions:



10M




    - Which two countries were in a space race? _(United States, Soviet Union)_


    - The Soviet Union launched the first object into space. What did they send?
_(a satellite, Sputnik 1)_


    - Did the first astronauts land anywhere in space. _(No, they were launched_
_into space, orbited the earth, and landed back on Earth.)_


Check for Understanding


**Think-Share:** How would you describe the experiences of the first
astronauts? _(Answers will vary.)_


  - Remind students that in other Read-Alouds, they learned that the sun and
other stars are too far away and too hot to visit. Ask students what celestial
body is close enough to Earth to visit and is made of rock instead of gas. _(the_
_moon)_


  - Explain that today’s Read-Aloud will teach students about the first astronauts
to visit the moon. Tell students that these first astronauts to visit the moon
were from the United States. Explain that since the first visit to the moon
many astronauts, including women, have made other achievements in space
exploration.


**TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using
conventions of language; **TEKS 1.7.A** Describe personal connections to a variety of sources.

The Apollo program involved many **missions** . ~~_or_~~

was a **disaster** . ~~_A disaster is a sudden, terrible_~~

the Apollo scientists had many successes. First,



there were unmanned missions to test various rockets and systems. ~~_These_~~

~~_handle the trip._~~ This picture shows Apollo 4, an unmanned mission to test a

rocket engine. This is the type of engine that would eventually carry men to

the moon.


**Show Image 7A-4: Apollo 7 crew**

Next came manned missions, ~~_or missions with_~~

~~_people_~~ but these astronauts did not get to go

to the moon. Instead, they were practicing and

testing equipment to make sure everything

would work properly. This photo shows the crew







of the Apollo 7 mission.


**Show Image 7A-5: Apollo 11 crew**

Finally, on July 16, 1969, Apollo 11 was launched

from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. There

were three astronauts aboard: ~~_[Point to the_~~

~~_three astronauts in the center of this image.]_~~ Neil

Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin. This

picture was taken shortly before they went on

their **historic** mission. ~~_It was historic because it_~~



**110**



~~_was important and many people would remember it for many years._~~


It took four days for Apollo 11 to travel the 239,000 miles from Earth to

the moon. ~~_Does that sound like a long time? You heard in an earlier Read-_~~

~~_Aloud that it would take thousands of years to travel to some stars._~~ During

the launch, the astronauts were sitting in the very top of the rocket. Once

it reached outer space, the part they were in broke off from the rocket


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


and continued on toward the moon. The rocket was not needed once the

ship reached outer space. ~~_The rocket’s job was done after it launched the_~~

~~_spacecraft beyond the earth’s atmosphere._~~


**Show Image 7A-6: Eagle in orbit**

Michael Collins was the pilot for the command

module, which drove the lunar module close to

the moon but did not actually land there. The

lunar module, called the Eagle, was attached to

the command module during the journey from





Earth to the moon. ~~_In fact, the word_~~ ~~lunar~~ ~~_is used_~~

~~_to describe anything that is related to the moon._~~



Once they got close enough to the moon, however, the Eagle broke off from

the command module and landed on the surface. ~~_So the spacecraft had three_~~

~~_parts at launch, but only the lunar module [point to the picture] actually landed_~~

~~_on the moon._~~ The command module orbited the moon as Buzz Aldrin and Neil

Armstrong descended ~~_or went down_~~ towards the surface of the moon.


**Show Image 7A-7: Mission control**
~~_This is mission control, where NASA scientists on_~~

~~_The United States was the first country in the world to send people to the moon._~~


Lesson 7 Exploration of the Moon
**111**


**Show Image 7A-9: The Eagle has landed**

It took longer than expected, but finally Neil

Armstrong announced the famous words, “The

Eagle has landed.” Great sighs of relief and

cheers went up from mission control and in

living rooms across America.


**Show Image 7A-10: Armstrong stepping onto**

**the moon**

Next, Neil Armstrong prepared to leave the

Eagle and step out onto the moon. This

picture shows what Americans back home

saw on their television sets. As you can see,

the picture was not very clear, but if you look

closely you can see Armstrong about to set

foot on the moon’s surface.



Armstrong stepped down and landed on the fine, soft dust of the moon’s

surface. With his first step he said, “That’s one small step for a man,

one giant leap for mankind.” What did Neil Armstrong mean? ~~_[Pause for_~~

~~_responses.]_~~ He meant that he himself had taken a small step—from the

Eagle’s ladder onto the moon—but that step represented a huge leap in

terms of the advances humans had made by landing on the moon.


**Show Image 7A-11: Buzz Aldrin**

Buzz Aldrin followed Armstrong down the

ladder. Both astronauts wore special spacesuits

designed to endure the harsh temperatures on

the moon’s surface.





The astronauts conducted experiments to help

future astronauts and scientists. The first thing

they noticed was their mobility, or how different it felt to walk and move

around. The moon has very little gravity compared to Earth. Here on Earth,

when you jump up you come straight back down—not so on the moon. When

you hop on the moon, you stay up for a few seconds and come down rather

slowly. ~~_Can you imagine hopping up in the air and staying up there for a bit?_~~

~~_Imagine how far you could jump!_~~


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


**Show Image 7A-12: The flag**

The astronauts collected samples of the moon’s

dust and rocks. Then they planted an American

flag in the moon’s soil. ~~_Explorers often plant_~~

~~_flags, bury special objects, or take photographs_~~

~~_of themselves to mark the special moment of_~~

~~_achieving their goal._~~ They had prepared the flag

beforehand by inserting wires in it so that it



would be firm but appear to be waving, even though there is no wind on the

moon.


Five more Apollo missions landed successfully on the moon after that first

mission. In the end, the Apollo astronauts brought back a total of 842 pounds

of moon rocks. Many of these rocks are on display in museums around

the world.


Apollo 17, launched in 1972, was the last mission to reach the moon. Nobody

has returned to the moon since. That is bound to change as humans continue

to explore outer space. ~~_[If additional manned lunar missions have occurred_~~

~~_since 1972, mention them here.]_~~


**Show Image 7A-13: Exploration Achievements**





Since the Apollo mission, astronauts have

continued to make remarkable achievements

in space exploration. Women have played a

significant role in these accomplishments,

including Eileen Collins, Peggy Whitson, and

Christina Koch. Eileen was the first female

space shuttle pilot and Peggy Whitson set

the record for the most time spent in space.



Christina Koch completed the longest space flight by a woman, spending a

total of 328 days in space! Other significant contributors to space exploration

include Guion Bluford, the first Black American astronaut to travel to space,

and Ellison Onizuka, a Hawaiian astronaut who flew on the Space Shuttle

Discovery. He was the first Asian American to make it to space. Another

notable astronaut is Mexican American engineer José Hernández, who was

the first person to use Spanish in space. Hernández worked with his family

on farms as a child and moved often, attending several schools. As an adult,

Hernández persevered throughout college and his career, finally becoming

an astronaut in 2004. He had been turned down several times prior to finally

being selected, but he remained determined to become an astronaut. These

achievements showcase the diversity and talent of the astronaut corps and

highlight the incredible strides that have been made since the Apollo missions.

~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Inferential.** An unmanned mission is a task to be completed on a spacecraft
with no people on it. Why did NASA send unmanned missions to the moon
before manned ones? ( _to first make sure that it was safe for people_ ) What
were the purposes of these unmanned missions? ( _to study the temperature_
_and surface of the moon; test the rockets and equipment_ ) Before the
unmanned missions, how did astronomers get most of their information
about the moon? ( _telescopes_ )

the command module, and the lunar module (or Eagle). Which part launched
it into space? ( _rocket_ ) Which part held the pilot who orbited the moon
without landing? ( _command module_ ) Which part landed on the moon? ( _the_
_lunar module, also called the Eagle_ )


3. **Inferential.** You learned that scientists at mission control and people at

4. **Inferential.** You learned that astronauts brought back over 842 pounds of
moon rocks. Why do you think they brought back so many rocks from the
moon? ( _to study them, and to find out what they’re made of_ )


Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** Neil Armstrong stepped off the ladder
and said, “That’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for

~~**LESSON AT A GLANCE**~~


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Introducing the Read-Aloud**

          - Be prepared to record what students know and wish to know about planets
on the board/chart paper. If a student’s response includes inaccurate factual
information, record it nonetheless and acknowledge the response by saying
something like, “So you think that Pluto is a planet? We’ll have to listen very
carefully to our Read-Alouds and find out if that’s true!” Refer to this list in
the following lesson as well.


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


**Application**

  - Prepare and display a Planets Chart to record what students have learned
about planets. You will place an image card in the second column of the chart,
so it must be large enough to accommodate those eight 8 1/2 x 11 cards.
Alternatively, a digital version of this chart may be accessed in the online
materials for this unit.

**Note to Teacher**


During Lessons 8 and 9, students will learn about the planets that make up
our solar system. Before the Read-Aloud in this lesson, students will be asked
to share what they already know about planets. Record this information on
the board/chart paper, along with what students hope to learn, akin to the
K (know) and W (wonder) of a KWL chart. Students will record what they
learned (L) in a separate chart, however—the Planets Chart.

**Show Image 8A-1: People stargazing**

For thousands of years, stargazers have known

that the sun, moon, and stars are not the only

celestial bodies in the night skies above Earth.

Ancient stargazers recognized that there are

other planets up there as well. ~~_Remember that_~~





~~_a planet is a large celestial body that revolves_~~

~~_around a star for light and heat._~~ What they did



not know is that these planets, like Earth, revolve around the sun. Astronomers

now know of eight major planets, including Earth, that revolve around the sun.

~~_The other day, you heard the word_~~ ~~major~~ ~~_and its antonym, or opposite,_~~ ~~minor~~ ~~_._~~

~~_What does the word_~~ ~~major~~ ~~_mean?_~~ ~~(big or important)~~ In addition, there are a

**128**





**Show Image 8A-2: Diagram of the solar system**

The word **solar** is used to describe something that

is related to the sun. For example, solar energy

refers to the heat and light that come from the sun.

Planets and other celestial bodies that orbit the

sun make up what is known as the solar system. ~~_So_~~

~~_what do we call the sun and the planets that orbit it?_~~

~~_What does the word_~~ ~~lunar~~ ~~_refer to?_~~ ~~(the moon)~~



This diagram shows the eight major planets in our solar system. About the

only thing these eight planets have in common is the fact that they all orbit

the same sun on their own special path. Beyond that, each planet is **unique**

~~_one of a kind and different from any other_~~ . The first four planets you will learn

about are called the **inner** planets ~~_or the ones near the center of the solar_~~

~~_system_~~ : Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.


**Show Image 8A-3: Mercury**

Mercury is the closest planet to the sun and the

smallest of the eight major planets in the solar

system. ~~_Being the smallest and closest to the_~~

~~_sun makes Mercury unique._~~ Mercury can be seen

from Earth, but it is hard to spot. You can only see





it in the early morning or early evening.



Most of the planets in the solar system are named after mythological Roman

gods and goddesses. ~~_Remember that the names of constellations also came_~~

~~_from Greek and Roman myths._~~ The planet Mercury is named after the Roman

god Mercury. In mythology, the god Mercury was very fast, so it makes sense

that this planet is named after him. It takes just eighty-eight Earth days for

Mercury to complete a revolution around the sun, so it is a quick little planet.

~~_Remember that Earth takes 365 days to orbit the sun. So if Mercury only takes_~~

~~_eighty-eight days, which planet is faster?_~~ Unlike Earth, Mercury does not rotate

much. It spins on its axis just one and a half times during its revolution around

the sun.


**Show Image 8A-4: Close-up of Mercury**
~~_Describe what you see in this close-up picture of_~~

~~_Mercury._~~

At first glance, you might notice that Mercury

looks a lot like our moon with its rocky, heavily

cratered surface. Mercury has some of the





Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


largest known crater impacts in the solar system, meaning that it has been

hit by some very large rocks. In fact, some craters are about fifty miles wide.


Mercury has no atmosphere to protect it like Earth does. ~~_Like they do to our_~~

~~_moon, rocks and debris just crash right into Mercury’s surface, making the_~~

~~_craters._~~ And because it is so close to the sun, the surface of Mercury is very,

very hot or very, very cold. Temperatures on the surface facing the sun can

range anywhere from 300 degrees to nearly 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit ~~_On_~~

~~_Earth, we consider ninety degrees Fahrenheit to be hot._~~ while the surface

facing away from the sun can be as low as 350 degrees below zero. ~~_Thirty-_~~

~~_two degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature at which water freezes on Earth._~~


**Show Image 8A-5: Venus**

Venus is the second planet from the sun. It

is named after the Roman goddess of love.

Aside from the sun and the moon, Venus is the

brightest celestial object that you can see from

Earth. ~~_Being the brightest object in our night sky_~~





~~_makes Venus unique._~~


It takes Venus roughly 225 Earth days to revolve



around the sun. However, like Mercury, Venus does not rotate on its axis very

fast. In fact, Venus actually rotates in the opposite direction that Earth does.


**Show Image 8A-6: Venus viewed from Earth**

~~_[Point to Venus in the image.] What else do you see_~~

~~_in this image?_~~ ~~(the moon)~~

Venus is sometimes referred to as the “morning

star” or the “evening star” because it often

appears as a bright object in the evening sky or





as a bright object in the morning sky. Venus is

also known as Earth’s sister planet because it



is the closest planet to Earth, and the two planets are roughly the same size.

~~_Being a sister planet to Earth is another fact unique to Venus._~~


Beyond that, however, Earth and Venus have very little in common. Venus’s

atmosphere consists of a very thick layer of clouds, so it is difficult for

astronomers to study its surface. We do know, however, that the surface is

very hot and dry. Venus’s thick, cloudy atmosphere traps much of the sun’s

energy, meaning temperatures on the planet can soar to above 800 degrees



Support


Recall from _Early American_
_Civilizations: Aztecs, Maya,_
_Incas_ that the Mayans, who
did not have a telescope or
other modern technologies,
thought that Venus was
a star.

You should recognize the planet in this photo.





It’s your home planet, Earth, the third planet

from the sun. Earth is the only planet that does

not take its name from a Roman or Greek god.



The word _earth_ is an ancient word that originally meant “ground.” When the

word earth was invented, the people living here did not even know that it was

a planet. This photo was taken by the astronauts of the Apollo 8 mission.

They did not get to land on the moon, but they flew around it.


**Show Image 8A-8: Earth’s surface**

One of the most important factors that sets

Earth apart from other planets is the **abundant**

supply of water. ~~_That means there is more than_~~

~~_enough or plenty of water._~~ Water is essential for

life; without water, there could not be any living





things like people, plants, or animals. Although

some other celestial bodies in our solar system



have some water, Earth is the only planet whose surface is mostly liquid

water. Earth is also the only planet with an abundance of oxygen in the air,

and oxygen is also essential for life. ~~_Its supply of water and oxygen makes_~~

~~_Earth unique. So after Mercury and Venus comes planet Earth, where we live._~~


**Show Image 8A-9: Mars**

Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. Mars

is named after the Roman god of war. Mars is

often referred to as the Red Planet because of

its color. ~~_Its red color makes Mars unique. Here_~~

~~_the word_~~ ~~color~~ ~~_means the tone you see when_~~





~~_you look at something, such as red, blue, or_~~

~~_green._~~ You can see Mars from Earth, and even



**130**



without a telescope you can identify it by its reddish tint.


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


The farther you get from the sun, the colder it is and the longer it takes to

complete a revolution, or make one trip around the sun. It takes Mars 687

Earth days to revolve around the sun. It is interesting, though, that Mars

rotates on its axis at about the same speed as Earth.


**Show Image 8A-10: Phobos**

Mars has two moons, but they are small and

oddly shaped. Phobos, the larger moon, is

pictured here. Astronomers believe that these

moons are actually large asteroids, or space

rocks, that became trapped in orbit as they







passed by Mars billions of years ago.


**Show Image 8A-11: Mars surface**

Because Mars is relatively close to Earth,

astronomers from NASA have been able to

send several spacecraft to explore that planet.

NASA has sent several unmanned spacecraft

to orbit Mars. NASA has also managed to send

several small robotic vehicles, called rovers,

to explore Mars’s surface. The photo you see



here is the first color photo ever taken on another planet! It was snapped by

the Spirit Exploration Rover. Most of the rocky surface of Mars is covered in

a layer of rust, which is a reddish-brown color. The rust explains why Mars

appears to be red.


NASA scientists hope to be able to send astronauts to Mars, but it may

be many, many years before technology exists that might allow them

to **accomplish** this ~~_or achieve this goal_~~ . Perhaps, if you decide to be an

astronaut when you grow up, you will be the first person to set foot on Mars.

It will not be easy to put a person on Mars, but people used to think it was

impossible to go to the moon, too. ~~_Mars is also unique because it is a celestial_~~

~~_body we might be able to visit one day._~~


Lesson 8 The Solar System, Part I
**131**


**132**



~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** You heard that the word _solar_ means something related to the sun.
What is the solar system? ( _group of planets and other celestial bodies that_
_orbit the sun_ )


2. **Inferential.** How many planets are in our solar system? ( _eight_ ) What do all
the planets have in common? ( _They orbit the sun._ ) You heard that orbiting
the sun is about the only thing all eight planets have in common. What does
this mean and what could be possible differences? ( _Orbiting the sun is about_
_the only way in which they are the same; in other ways they are all unique or_
_very different from one another._ )


**Show Image 8A-2: Diagram of the solar system**


Check for Understanding


**Point to It:** [Have students come up and point to each of the
inner planets as you name them: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars.]


   - **Literal.** You learned that all eight planets orbit the sun. Why don’t they
bump into each other? ( _They all have their own paths, or orbits.)_ You
learned that the first four planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
Why are they called the inner planets? ( _They are closest to the sun._ ) A
planet’s year is how long it takes the planet to orbit the sun. Which planet
has the shortest year, meaning it takes the shortest time to go around the
sun? ( _Mercury_ )


3. Ask the following questions about the planets learned about today:


**Show Image 8A-3: Mercury**

   - **Literal.** This is the first planet in the solar system, known for being the
smallest and the closest to the sun. What is the name of this planet?
( _Mercury_ )


**Show Image 8A-5: Venus**

   - **Literal.** This is the second planet in the solar system, known for being
the brightest planet as seen from Earth. What is the name of this planet?
( _Venus_ )


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


**Show Image 8A-7: Earth from moon**

    - **Inferential.** This is the third planet in the solar system, known for having
lots of water, oxygen, and life. The third planet is the most important one
to us. What is the name of this planet? ( _Earth_ ) Why is it most important to
us? ( _We live on it._ )


**Show Image 8A-9: Mars**

    - **Literal.** This is the fourth planet in the solar system, known as the Red
Planet. What is the name of this planet? ( _Mars_ )


4. **Evaluative.** Which planet do you think has the longest year, meaning it
takes the longest time to go around the sun? [Point to the outer planets in
succession until students identify the outermost one.]


~~**WORD WORK: ABUNDANT (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In today’s Read-Aloud you heard, “One of the most important factors that
sets Earth apart from other planets is the abundant supply of water.”


2. Say the word _abundant_ with me.


3. When you say something is abundant, you mean you have a lot or more than
enough of it.


4. When there is a lot of rain and good soil, farmers expect an abundant crop.


5. Do you have an abundant supply of anything? Try to use the word _abundant_
when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or
rephrase the students’ responses: “I have an abundant supply of .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use an Antonyms activity for follow-up.** You know that _abundant_ means
having more than enough of something, or having plenty of it. The opposite
of _abundant_ is _scarce_, which means not having enough of something, or
having very little. Listen to the following examples. If I describe an amount
that is plentiful, say, “That is abundant.” If I describe an amount that is very
little, say, “That is scarce.”


    - the number of stars in the sky ( _That is abundant._ )


    - the amount of rain in the desert ( _That is scarce._ )


    - the amount of light from the sun ( _That is abundant._ )


    - the number of grains of sand on the beach ( _That is abundant._ )


    - the amount of the moon you can see when it is a crescent moon
( _That is scarce._ )

10M



**One-Word Answer:** Ask students to recall the name of one of
the four inner planets they learned about in the last Read-Aloud.
( _Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars_ )


  - Sing the planets song with students to review the first four major planets
discussed in the previous Read-Aloud. The song is sung to the tune of “Oh My
Darling, Clementine”:


_Do you know the solar system?_
_It’s our home in outer space._
_Planets orbit round the sun, while_
_It shines brightly in one place._


_First is Mercury, small and speedy,_
_Second, Venus, shining bright._
_Third is Earth, a home for people._
_Fourth is Mars, a rusty sight._


  - Read the Planets Chart you developed in the previous lesson. Ask students
why these planets are called the inner planets. ( _They are closest to the_
_sun._ ) Remind students to speak clearly and at an appropriate pace when
addressing the class.


**TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using

30M
##### Read-Aloud


**Reading:** Students will identify the outer planets of our solar system.

~~**TEKS 1.1.A; TEKS 1.7.C**~~


**Language:** Students will demonstrate an understanding of the Tier 2 words
_categorize,_ _inner,_ and _outer_ .

~~**TEKS 1.3.D**~~


~~**PURPOSE FOR LISTENING**~~


  - Tell students to listen carefully to learn the name of each planet and what
makes it unique, so they can add these facts to the Planets Chart.


~~**“THE SOLAR SYSTEM, PART II” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 9A-1: Solar system diagram**

In the last Read-Aloud you learned about the four

inner planets of our solar system: Mercury, Venus,

Earth, and Mars. Now you will learn about the **outer**

planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus [/y ə r*aen*us/],

and Neptune, as well as the famous dwarf planet,





Pluto. ~~_These planets are farthest from the sun, on_~~

~~_the outside part of the solar system._~~



The first important difference between the inner planets and the outer planets

is that the inner planets are all made up of rocks and metals, whereas the

outer planets are made of different types of gases. ~~_You learned about gases_~~

~~_when we began our study of astronomy. What are gases? A gas is something_~~

~~_that is neither liquid nor solid._~~


**Show Image 9A-2: Jupiter**

The planet Jupiter is the fifth planet from the

sun. In Roman mythology, Jupiter was the king

of the mythical gods—the strongest and most

powerful of all. The largest planet in our solar

system is named after him. ~~_Being the largest_~~





**TEKS 1.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and answer questions using multi-word responses;
**TEKS 1.7.C** Use text evidence to support an appropriate response; **TEKS 1.3.D** Identify and use words that name actions,
directions, positions, sequences, categories, and locations.


Lesson 9 The Solar System Part II
**141**


~~_planet makes Jupiter unique._~~ Jupiter is so big that you could stuff about 1,300

planet Earths inside of it.


It takes Jupiter nearly twelve Earth years to make one revolution around

the sun. However, Jupiter rotates on its axis faster than any other planet

in the solar system. This massive planet rotates all the way around on its

axis in less than ten hours. Jupiter is made mostly of hydrogen and other

gases. Because of its fast rotation and the mixing of its gases, Jupiter is an

extremely **violent** ~~_or dangerously rough_~~, stormy place.


**Show Image 9A-3: Red spot**

The best-known feature on Jupiter is its large,

red spot. This spot is actually a massive

storm. ~~_This stormy, red spot makes Jupiter_~~

~~_unique, and it helps us remember what the_~~

~~_planet looks like._~~ The storm is so big that you





could fit three planet Earths inside of it! Jupiter

can be seen without a telescope from Earth,



and sometimes you can see its red spot with an ordinary telescope.


**Show Image 9A-4: Jupiter’s moons**

There are at least sixty-three moons in

orbit around Jupiter. ~~_How many moons does_~~

~~_Earth have? Jupiter has sixty-three moons_~~

~~_going around it!_~~ Most of them are very small.

However, four of these moons are well-known.





They were all discovered first by the famous

astronomer Galileo. These are easily visible



**142**



with a pair of binoculars. Each is interesting in its own way, particularly

Europa, the small one in the upper right. ~~_[Point to Europa.]_~~


Europa is slightly smaller than our own moon, and yet—for many

astronomers—it is one of the most fascinating celestial bodies in the solar

system. Europa’s surface is covered in ice, and its atmosphere contains a

lot of oxygen. Many astronomers believe that beneath Europa’s ice there

is an ocean of liquid water. This means that maybe—just maybe—there is

some form of life on this distant little moon. ~~_So far, the only place in the solar_~~

~~_system that we know has life is our own planet Earth._~~


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


**Show Image 9A-5: Saturn**

The next planet in the solar system is Saturn,

the sixth planet from the sun. It is the second
largest planet in the solar system, although it is

much smaller than Jupiter. Saturn is famous for

its rings. It is not the only planet with rings, but

no other planet has rings like Saturn’s. ~~_Its rings_~~

~~_make Saturn unique and easy to recognize._~~ This



incredible photo was taken by an unmanned orbiter in 2004.


Saturn has several layers with different types of clouds, and it is quite

stormy, though not as stormy as its neighbor Jupiter. ~~_These layers and clouds_~~

~~_are part of the planet. Remember, outer planets are made of gases. What_~~

~~_are inner planets made of?_~~ Because it is so far from the sun, it takes Saturn

nearly thirty Earth years to make one complete orbit. Different parts of

Saturn rotate at different speeds, but for the most part Saturn rotates on its

axis very quickly, taking a little over ten hours to complete one rotation.


**Show Image 9A-6: The rings, close-up**

The rings of Saturn are always moving around the

planet. They are made up mainly of ice and a few

other types of materials. The rings are basically

huge collections of dust with some larger chunks

here and there. Nobody is sure how the rings





got there. Some astronomers believe the rings

formed when one of Saturn’s moons exploded



and the debris ~~_or broken pieces_~~ became trapped in orbit. Others say the

material in the rings is left over from the time when Saturn was formed billions

of years ago. You can see Saturn from Earth during certain times of our year,

and with an ordinary telescope you can see the rings.


**Show Image 9A-7: Uranus**

The seventh planet, Uranus, has the coldest

atmosphere of any planet in the solar system. ~~_Its_~~

~~_cold atmosphere makes Uranus unique._~~ Because

it is so far from the sun, it takes Uranus eighty
four Earth years to make one complete orbit.



Challenge


Why might you only be
able to see Saturn at
certain times of our year?
_(The orbits and rotations_
_of Earth and Saturn put_
_them at different places at_
_different times.)_





Uranus is mostly made of hydrogen, but its

atmosphere also contains a lot of ice and other

substances not found on Jupiter or Saturn.



Lesson 9 The Solar System Part II
**143**


Support


Show a picture of Uranus’s
axis, or draw a diagram on
the board/chart paper.


**144**



Uranus is named after a Greek god of the sky, making it the only planet other

than Earth that is not named after a Roman god. Although it is possible to

see Uranus from Earth without a telescope, you really have to know where

and when to look for it because it appears very dim, or not very bright, from

here on Earth.


Uranus has one very special characteristic: it rotates on its side! You can’t

see it in this image, but in comparison to Earth and the other planets,

Uranus’s axis is sideways, as though someone turned the planet on its

side. ~~_Lying on its side makes Uranus unique._~~


**Show Image 9A-8: Neptune**

The planet Neptune is the eighth and final major

planet in the solar system. In Roman mythology,

Neptune was the god of the sea, so this is a

fitting name, given the planet’s beautiful, blue

color. ~~_Its blue color and its distance from the sun_~~





~~_make Neptune unique. What was the red planet_~~

~~_you heard about yesterday?_~~ ~~(Mars)~~ Astronomers



still do not know exactly why Neptune is blue, and it will probably be a while

before they figure it out. That is because Neptune is nearly three billion

miles from the sun, making it very difficult and expensive to send unmanned

**probes** to explore it. ~~_Probes are tools designed to collect information in outer_~~

~~_space and send it back to Earth._~~


It takes Neptune nearly 165 Earth years to orbit the sun. The planet is never

visible without a telescope from Earth, and you will need a fairly powerful

telescope to get a good view of its beautiful color.


**Show Image 9A-9: Pluto**

Not so very long ago, students in school were

taught that there were nine planets in the solar

system, including Pluto. In fact, ever since Pluto

was discovered in 1930, it has been considered a

planet. However, in 2006, astronomers decided





to **categorize** Pluto as a dwarf planet, one of

several such bodies in our solar system. ~~_They_~~



~~_decided to sort planets into two groups: dwarf, meaning “little”; and regular._~~

~~_Categorizing Pluto as a dwarf planet means they put Pluto in the dwarf_~~

~~_planet group._~~


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


In Roman mythology, Pluto was the god of the underworld, a dark and dreary

place. This is a good name for such a cold and distant dwarf planet. Pluto

is about four billion miles from the sun, so it is extremely cold and dark out

there. The planet is made almost entirely of frozen nitrogen. Most nitrogen

found on Earth is a gas but out in the depths of space it is frozen. It takes

Pluto about 243 Earth years to orbit the sun.


We have a lot to learn about Pluto and other celestial bodies in the outer

reaches of the solar system, but it is not easy to explore this area. For now,

this is about the best photo we have of Pluto, and it was taken from three

billion miles away by a special spacecraft called the Hubble Space Telescope.

A special probe was launched toward Pluto in the year 2003, and it reached

Pluto in 2015. Scientists learned new things about Pluto from the data

collected by the probe. ~~_What do probes do?_~~


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


Check for Understanding


**Recall:** You learned that the inner planets are all made of metal
and rock. What are all the outer planets made of? ( _gases_ )


1. Ask students the following questions about the outer planets:


**Show Image 9A-2: Jupiter**

    - **Literal.** This is the fifth planet in the solar system, known for being the
largest planet, and having a red spot and sixty-three moons. What is the
name of this planet? ( _Jupiter_ )


**Show Image 9A-5: Saturn**

    - **Literal.** This is the sixth planet in the solar system, known for the rings
around it. What is the name of this planet? ( _Saturn_ )


**Show Image 9A-7: Uranus**

    - **Literal.** This is the seventh planet in the solar system, known for being the
coldest planet and for rotating on its side. What is the name of this planet?
( _Uranus_ )


**Show Image 9A-8: Neptune**

    - **Literal.** This is the eighth or last planet in the solar system, known as the
blue planet. What is the name of this planet? ( _Neptune_ )

2. **Inferential.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ Astronomers believed for seventy-six years
that Pluto was the ninth planet in our solar system. Astronomers found other
celestial bodies in deep space that were like Pluto, and they came up with a
new category that they called dwarf, or small, planet. Why do you think they
took so long to make this change? ( _Pluto is so far away; we haven’t learned_
_much about deep space.)_


~~**WORD WORK: CATEGORIZE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud we heard, “Astronomers decided to categorize Pluto as a
dwarf planet.”


2. Say the word _categorize_ with me.


3. When you categorize something, you sort it or put it in a group with other
things like it.


4. You might categorize your clothes by putting shirts in one drawer of your
dresser and pants in another.


5. Pretend you had a collection of colorful buttons in different shapes and sizes.
What is one way you could categorize them? Try to use the word _categorize_
when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or
rephrase the students’ responses: “I could categorize the buttons by . . . ”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Show Image Cards 1 and 7–13**


**Use an Image Card activity for follow-up.** [Take Image Cards 1 and 7–13
and show them to students. Then show Flip Book image 8A-2, the diagram
of the solar system, and show students that the images on the Image
Cards are of the same planets that are on the diagram. Write two category
names on chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard: “Inner” and “Outer.”]
We know that to categorize means to sort or put objects in groups based
on what they have in common. Let’s take these eight planet Image Cards
and categorize them by inner planets (the ones you learned about in the
previous lesson that are closer to the sun) and outer planets (the ones you
learned about today that are farther from the sun). We can use this diagram
of the solar system if you forget where each planet goes. The groups we
make will be called categories. Who would like to come up and categorize
one of these planets, putting it in the right category? [Call on volunteers
to sort the planets. During the activity, use the word _categorize_ frequently
and encourage each volunteer to use it in a sentence, such as “I categorized
Mercury as an inner planet.”]

There are three parts to this assessment. You may choose to do the
parts in more than one sitting if you feel this is more appropriate for your
students. Part I, “vocabulary assessment,” is divided into two sections, the
first assesses unit-related vocabulary, and the second assesses academic
vocabulary. Parts II and III of the assessment address the core content
targeted in _Astronomy: Space Exploration_ .


~~**PART I**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.7.F**~~


**Directions:** I am going to ask a question using a word you have heard in the
Read-Alouds. If the answer to the question is “yes,” circle the thumbs-up. If
the answer to the question is “no,” circle the thumbs-down. I will ask each
question two times. Let’s do the first question together.


**Note:** For students who will be using the Activity Page from the Editable PDF
Activity Book, please have them answer by typing “yes” if the sentence is
correct and “no” if the sentence is incorrect.


1. **Atmosphere:** Is the earth’s atmosphere the part that is far, far away from
Earth and contains the moon? _(thumbs-down)_


2. **Orbit:** Does the earth travel in an orbit around the sun? _(thumbs-up)_


3. **Planet:** Is a planet a small object that provides its own light and heat?
_(thumbs-down)_


4. **Telescopes:** Do scientists use telescopes to look at objects in the same room
as them? _(thumbs-down)_


5. **Constellations:** If you look up in the sky on a clear night, could you see
constellations, or groups of stars, that look like pictures? _(thumbs-up)_


6. **Astronaut:** Is an astronaut someone who travels in outer space? _(thumbs-up)_


7. **Launch:** Has the United States launched a rocket into space? _(thumbs-up)_


**TEKS 1.7.F** Respond using newly acquired vocabulary as appropriate.

8. **Solar:** Are things associated with the moon called solar? _(thumbs-down)_


**Directions:** I am going to ask more questions using other words you have
heard and practiced. If the answer to the question is “yes,” circle the thumbsup. If the answer to the question is “no,” circle the thumbs down. I will read
each question two times.


9. **Ancient:** Is a new bicycle considered ancient? _(thumbs-down)_


10. **Counterclockwise:** [Draw a counterclockwise circle.] Is this
counterclockwise? _(thumbs-up)_


11. **Determined:** Would a student who is determined to get good grades do all
his homework and do his best in class? _(thumbs-up)_


12. **Inner:** Is an inner planet closer to the sun than an outer planet? _(thumbs-up)_


13. **Major:** Does _major_ mean small or unimportant? _(thumbs-down)_


~~**PART II**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.6.G**~~


**Directions:** Listen to the following sentences about planets in our solar system.
On your page you will see each of these planets labeled in their location from the
sun. I will read each sentence, then read each of the planet names going outward
from the sun. Place the number of the sentence I read below the planet to which
it belongs. Each planet will have one sentence, and only one sentence, which
belongs with it. I will read all the sentences twice. Let’s do the first one together.


1. I am the planet on which we live. _(Earth)_


2. I am known as the “Red Planet,” and astronauts may be able to visit me one
day. _(Mars)_


3. I am the largest planet and have a big red spot, which is actually a storm.
_(Jupiter)_


4. I am the smallest planet and closest to the sun. _(Mercury)_


5. I am the planet with big, beautiful rings. _(Saturn)_


6. People call me Earth’s sister planet and the brightest planet, and I can be
seen in Earth’s sky. _(Venus)_


7. I lie on my side and I’m the only planet other than Earth not named after a
Roman god. _(Uranus)_


8. I am a blue planet and the farthest from the sun. _(Neptune)_


**TEKS 1.6.G** Evaluate details to determine what is important with adult assistance.


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration



**154**


~~**PART III**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.6.G**~~


**Directions:** I am going to read statements that refer to either the earth, the
sun, or the moon. If what I read to you describes something about Earth,
circle the first picture in the row. If what I read to you describes something
about the sun, circle the second picture in the row. If what I read to you
describes something about the moon, circle the last picture in the row.


1. This celestial body is your home—the planet on which you live. _(Earth)_


2. This celestial body has phases named after how much is seen of it: new,
crescent, half, and full. _(moon)_


3. This celestial body is the only planet known to have enough water and oxygen
to support life. _(Earth)_


4. This celestial body is the star that allows life to survive on Earth. _(sun)_


5. This celestial body was visited by astronauts from Earth. _(moon)_

##### Culminating Activities


~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


Please use these final two days to address class results of the Unit
Assessment. Based on the results of the Unit Assessment, you may wish to
use this class time to provide remediation opportunities that target specific
areas of weakness for individual students, small groups, or the whole class.


Alternatively, you may also choose to use this class time to extend or
enrich students’ experience with unit knowledge. A number of enrichment
activities are provided to provide students with opportunities to enliven their
experiences with unit concepts.


~~**REMEDIATION**~~


Remediation opportunities include:


  - targeting Review Activities


  - revisiting lesson Applications


  - rereading and discussing select Read-Alouds


~~**ENRICHMENT**~~


**Unit-Related Trade Book or Student Choice**


Materials: Trade book

  - Read an additional trade book to review a particular event or concept.


  - You may also choose to have students select a Read-Aloud to be heard again.


**Relative Distances in the Solar System**


Materials: Masking tape; measuring tape

  - Take the students outside or to a large indoor space, such as a hallway.


  - Write the word _sun_ on a piece of masking tape or paper, and place it on the floor.


Unit 4 Astronomy: Space Exploration


  - Using the information in the chart below, mark out to scale the distances the
eight planets are from the sun. This activity will reinforce the vast distances
in space and will help students see why the inner and outer planets are
broken into two groups.


  - Depending upon how much space you have, you may want your unit of
measure to be feet, so that Mercury is five inches from the sun, Venus is eight
inches from the sun, Earth is one foot from the sun, etc.


  - If your students are familiar with the metric system, a simpler unit of
measure would be one meter.

|Planet|Distance from the Sun,<br>Using Bode’s Law|
|---|---|
|Mercury|0.4|
|Venus|0.7|
|Earth|1.0|
|Mars|1.6|
|asteroid belt|2.8|
|Jupiter|5.2|
|Saturn|10.0|
|Uranus|19.6|
|Neptune|38.8|



**Mnemonic for Planets**


Materials: Writing paper, writing tools

  - Explain that one way people remember the names of the planets in order is
to memorize a sentence with words that start with the same letters as the
planets do.


  - As a group or individually, have students develop a new sentence for
remembering the sequence of the eight planets. You may want to provide
students with the first initials in sequence: M, V, E, M, J, S, U, and N.


Culminating Activities
**157**


**158**



**You Were There: In Outer Space**

 - Have students pretend that they were one of the first astronauts who
traveled to space or to the moon, or that they were one of the hundreds of
scientists at mission control.


 - Ask students to describe what they saw and heard. For example, for the first
walk on the moon, students may talk about the four days it took to travel
there; landing on the fine, soft dust of the moon’s surface; what they might
say once there; etc.


 - Consider also extending this activity by adding group or independent writing
opportunities associated with the “You Were There” concept. For example,
ask students to pretend they are newspaper reporters describing the moon
landing and write a group news article describing the event.
