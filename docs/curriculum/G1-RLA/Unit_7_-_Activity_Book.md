Dear Family Member,


#### 1.2 Take-Home



During the next several days, your student will be learning about fairy tales. They will
hear classic versions of “Sleeping Beauty,” “Rumpelstiltskin,” “Rapunzel,” and “The Frog
Prince.” They will also learn about things that fairy tales have in common, such as “once
upon a time” beginnings, typical characters and settings, fantasy events, unique solutions
to problems, and happy endings. Below are some suggestions for activities that you may
do at home to reinforce what your student is learning about fairy tales.


1. Favorite Fairy Tales


Have your student tell you about the fairy tales they have heard. Share with your
student any memories you have of reading fairy tales, and discuss some of your favorite
characters or tales.


2. Draw and Write


Have your student draw and/or write about the fairy tales heard and then share the
drawing with you. Ask questions to keep your student using the vocabulary learned at school.


3. If You Were a Character


With your student, imagine what it would be like to be a character in one of these
stories. Despite the happy endings, fairy tales often touch on themes of sadness, fear, and
hardship. Talk about what the characters are experiencing, and encourage your student to
share any thoughts or feelings they may have while listening to these stories.


4. Sayings and Phrases: The Land of Nod


Your student has learned the saying “the land of Nod.” Talk with your student about
the meaning of this saying. (It is a way of saying that someone is asleep.) Point out times
when the saying applies in your daily life, perhaps at bedtime, or when they begin to nod
off before bed!


5. What’s In a Name?


Your student will hear two fairy tales (“Rapunzel” and “Rumpelstiltskin”) about
characters with interesting names. Over the next week, you may wish to talk with your
student about how their name was chosen. Write their name on a note card; on the other
side of the card, write a brief story about how your student’s name was chosen.

6. Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read to your student every day. The local library has many
classic and modern fairy tales and other stories that you can share with your student.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they have
learned at school.

Dear Family Member,


#### 6.2 Take-Home



I hope your student has enjoyed hearing some classic fairy tales. Over the next
several days, your student will hear two more fairy tales: “Hansel and Gretel” and “Jack
and the Beanstalk.” Your student will also have an opportunity to write their own fairy
tale using the knowledge they have gained from studying classic tales. Below are some
suggestions for activities that you may do at home to reinforce what your student is
learning about fairy tales.


1. Character Illustration


Have your student draw a picture of their favorite fairy tale character. Then have your
student explain why this character is their favorite character.


2. Fairy Tales Around the World


Many countries have their own unique fairy tales or versions of fairy tales that are
similar to ones your student has heard. If possible, visit the library and find a collection of
fairy tales from other countries. As you are reading these tales, encourage your student
to explore the similarities and differences between the tales of various countries. Ask
questions to keep your student using the vocabulary learned at school.


3. Theater at Home


Your student has learned about many different types of fairy tale characters, including
royalty, witches, and talking animals. Help your student act out one of the fairy tales they
have read and encourage them to act differently when playing the role of the various
characters. Use simple props or costumes, such as a crown made out of paper.


4. What’s Your Favorite Fairy Tale?


Over the next few days, tell your student what your favorite fairy tale was as a student.
You might even want to read your favorite fairy tale to your student.


5. Read Aloud Each Day


Remember to read to your student every day. The local library has many classic and
modern fairy tales and other stories that you can share with your student.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they have
learned at school.

Dear Family Member,


#### 10.2 Take-Home



I hope your student has enjoyed hearing some classic fairy tales. Over the next several
days, your student will hear two more fairy tales that are from around the world: “The
Secret of the Fishing Baskets” from West Africa and “The Magic Pitcher” from India. Your
student will also learn how to describe the fairy tale characters, their feelings, and actions.
Below are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to reinforce what your
student is learning about fairy tales.


1. What’s Your Favorite Character?


Talk to your student about their favorite character from a fairy tale they listened to.
Ask your student why it was their favorite character and to describe to you in words or a
drawing what their favorite character looks like.


2. Map It!


Look at a world map or globe with your student and find the locations of the fairy tales
they are listening to. Use the locations listed above.


3. Globe Trotting


Have your student choose a location that they would want to visit from a fairy tale they
have listened to. Have your student plan an itinerary for the trip by writing a list of things
they would want to do or places they want to visit while in that location.


4. From the Heart


In the fairy tales we have read, we are discussing how characters feel throughout the story.
Discuss with your student what feelings they had today and why they felt the way they did.


5. Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read to your student every day. The local library has many
classic and modern fairy tales and other stories that you can share with your student.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they have
learned at school.
