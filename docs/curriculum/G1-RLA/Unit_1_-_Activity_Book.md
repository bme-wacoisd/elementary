Dear Family Member,


### 1.2 Take-Home



Today your student listened to the well-known Aesop’s fable “The Boy Who Cried Wolf,”
and learned that fables are short stories that teach a lesson that is called the moral of the
story. Over the next several days, your student will also become familiar with the Aesop’s
fables “The Maid and the Milk Pail,” “The Goose and the Golden Eggs,” “The Dog in the
Manger,” “The Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing,” and “The Fox and the Grapes.” Some of these
fables have animal characters that act like people (personification), which is another
characteristic of fables.


Below are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to continue
enjoying the fables heard at school.


1. Character, Setting, and Plot


Talk with your student about the characters, setting, and plot of the fables. Ask
questions about the fables such as, “Why did the shepherd boy play a prank and cry, _‘Wolf!_
_Wolf!’_ ?” Also, make personal connections to the fables with questions such as, “If you
often don’t tell the truth, will people believe you when you are telling the truth?”


2. Illustrating Fables


Have your student draw or paint a picture of one of the fables and then tell you about
it. Again, ask questions to keep your student talking about the fable. Another option is to
create a three-part picture that shows the beginning, middle, and end of the fable.


3. Different Versions of Fables


Tell or read to your student different versions of a fable, then talk about how the
different versions are the same and how they are different.


4. Sayings and Phrases: “A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing” and “Sour Grapes”


Your student will learn about these phrases and their meanings. Once your student has
heard the fable “The Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing,” reinforce that the saying “a wolf in sheep’s
clothing” means that people are not always who they appear to be on the outside. On the

outside, the wolf looked like a sheep—but he was not. Explain that, in the same way, a
person can seem very nice on the outside but may not actually be very nice on the inside.
Once your student has heard the fable “The Fox and the Grapes,” reinforce that when he
couldn’t reach the grapes, the fox said, “I didn’t want those old grapes anyway. I’m sure
they are sour.” Explain that the phrase “sour grapes” describes when someone cannot get
what they want, so they end up saying untrue things. Talk with your student about how
these phrases apply to everyday situations.


5. Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read to your student every day. The local library has fables
and collections of fables that you can share with your student. Be sure to talk about the
characteristics of each fable—they are short, they have a moral, they use personification—
and how the moral applies to you and your student.


Let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they have learned
at school.

Dear Family Member,


### 7.2 Take-Home



We have finished the Aesop’s fables section of the _Sharing Stories_ unit. In the next
section of the unit, we will be listening to folktales and a parable. Today your student
heard “The Tale of Peter Rabbit,” a folktale from Great Britain. Tomorrow, your student
will hear “The Little Half-Chick (Medio Pollito),” a Spanish folktale. Students will finish
the unit reading a parable, or a simple, short fiction story that includes symbols used to
teach children lessons about character. Students will read “The Prodigal Son,” which is a
parable found in the Bible that includes vocabulary and references they will see in later
studies of literature and history.


Following are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to continue
enjoying the stories heard at school.


1. Storytelling Time


Have your student orally retell the story that they heard at school each day.


2. Character, Setting, and Plot


Talk with your student about the characters, setting, and plot of the stories.
Ask questions about the stories such as, “How did Peter Rabbit get into mischief?” Also,
make personal connections to the stories with questions such as, “Have you ever gotten
into mischief?”


3. Illustrating Stories


Have your student draw or paint a picture of one of the stories and then tell you about
it. Again, ask questions to keep your student talking about the story. Another option is to
create a three-part picture that shows the beginning, middle, and end of the story.


4. Sayings and Phrases: “Do Unto Others as You Would Have Done Unto You”


Your student has talked about this saying, known as the Golden Rule, and its meaning at
school. Talk with your student again about its meaning. To help reinforce good behavior at
school, find opportunities to compliment your student when they follow the Golden Rule.

5. Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read to your student every day. The local library has
folktales and collections of folktales that you can share with your student. You might
choose a different version of a fable or folktale your child has read at school and talk with
your student about how the different versions are the same and different.


Be sure to talk about the characters, setting, and plot of these stories. You may also
want to reread one that has been read at school.


Remember to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they
have learned at school.
