~~**WHY ADVENTURE STORIES ARE IMPORTANT**~~


This unit will introduce students to adventure stories set around the world and challenge students
to dig into the adventures through research. By listening to the Read-Alouds and trade books,
students will increase their vocabulary and reading comprehension skills, learn valuable lessons
about perseverance and teamwork, and become familiar with gathering information for research.
Students will study the careers of real-world explorers like Dr. Eugenie Clark, marvel at the
inventions of Jacques Cousteau, think critically about how teamwork and collaboration can make
greater adventures possible, learn about the science and technology that enable adventures, and
research some of the ways humans have confronted challenges at the edges of the world, from the
oceans below to space above.


Each lesson in the unit builds students’ research skills as they ask questions, gather information,
and write a paragraph about their findings. Students will share what they have learned about
adventures in an Adventure Gallery Walk. By taking on the persona of one of the adventurers they
meet in the Read-Alouds and trade books, students will deliver their final paragraphs as if they are a
“speaking portrait” of that person. Students are invited to dress up as that adventurer if they desire.


Teachers can set aside time outside of the instructional block to create the picture frames students
will hold as they present to the Adventure Gallery Walk guests. Frames can be made from shirt
boxes, cardboard, construction paper, or any art supplies that are on hand. This might be an
opportunity to collaborate with the school’s art department if resources are available. Another
option is to ask students to make their frames at home with their caregivers.


On the day of the Adventure Gallery Walk, students will be the hosts and take on specific jobs, such
as welcoming the guests, describing their work throughout the unit, and pointing out the areas of
study on the unit bulletin board. You can find a complete list of student jobs in Lesson 13.


The adventure stories that students will be reading and discussing in this unit also provide
opportunities for students to build content knowledge and draw connections to the social studies
and science subject areas. At times throughout the unit, you may wish to build on class discussions
to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of Geography, History,
and Science, Technology, and Society from the Social Studies TEKS, as well as Scientific and
Engineering Practices and Recurring Themes and Concepts from the Science TEKS. This content is
not a replacement for grade level social studies or science instruction. For more information about
the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the
Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


Unit 10 Adventure Stories: Tales from the Edges of the World


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED**~~


The following units, and the specific core content that was targeted in those units, are particularly
relevant to the Read-Alouds and trade books students will hear in _Adventure Stories: Tales from the_
_Edges of the World_ . This background knowledge will greatly enhance your students’ understanding
of the Read-Alouds and trade books they are about to enjoy:


 - **Nursery Rhymes and Fables (Kindergarten)**


 - **Fairy Tales and Folktales (Kindergarten)**


~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR ADVENTURE STORIES:**~~

~~**TALES FROM THE EDGES OF THE WORLD**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _Adventure Stories: Tales from the_
_Edges of the World_ in the forms in which they appear in the Read-Alouds and trade books or, in
some instances, in the “Introducing the Read-Aloud” and “Application” sections of the lesson. Boldfaced words in the list have an associated Word Work activity. The inclusion of the words on this
list does not mean that students are immediately expected to be able to use all of these words on
their own. However, through repeated exposure throughout the lessons, they should acquire a good
understanding of most of these words and begin to use some of them in conversation.

~~**FOUNDATIONAL ORAL LANGUAGE**~~


The Think-Pair-Share and Turn and Talk prompts throughout the unit provide opportunities to teach
and reinforce how to communicate by using conventions of language, speaking when recognized,
and making appropriate contributions to discussion.


  - You can also reinforce these ideas by modeling using an appropriate pace, recognizing students’

individual contributions to group discussions, and pointing out conventions of language.


  - Explain to students that when working in whole/small groups, group members share responsibility

for the work they do together. To work effectively and respectfully, everyone should recognize the
contributions made by each group member. For example, as group members discuss a text, each
group member can share thoughts and reactions. If preparing to return to a whole-group discussion,
group members can summarize the group’s ideas by including contributions from everyone in the
group.


  - Consider using a discussion checklist that tracks student participation, as well as introducing

discussion techniques that enhance participation.

~~**TEKS 1.1.C; TEKS 1.1.D**~~


~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit, students will explore the genre of research writing. Through graphic organizers, each
lesson will build students’ understanding of the research process, including brainstorming, asking
questions, gathering information from texts, and writing about what they have learned.


To show what they have learned, students will write a paragraph about their chosen adventure
topic. On the next page, you will find the rubric to assess student mastery of writing an informative/
explanatory paragraph.


It is recommended that students keep all materials relating to the research element in a folder for
easy access. Additionally, you may choose to have students utilize computers as they go through
the inquiry process and complete their research projects. Please refer to Technology Applications
TEKS 1.9.A–E to support and guide instruction if you choose to incorporate computer usage into
this project.


**TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using the conventions of language;
**TEKS 1.1.D** Work collaboratively with others by following agreed-upon rules for discussion, including listening to others, speaking when recognized, and making
appropriate contributions.

But at some point in your life, you have to go to each of them for the first
time. And that first time you step from someplace you know to someplace
you don’t is an adventure. ~~_What are some places you’ve been to that you_~~
~~_consider adventuresome?_~~


**Show Image 1A-3: People exploring a cave**


Life is all about adventures! Imagine a life
without them. Sometimes adventures can be
exciting or even mysterious! But if no one took
on that adventure, we’d know so much less
about the world. ~~_Can you think of an adventure_~~
~~_that might be exciting or mysterious?_~~


**Show Image 1A-4: Robert Peary and Matthew**
**Henson**


Sometimes adventures take us to fantastic
places. Robert Peary and Matthew Henson
were explorers who were the first to see a
completely frozen world. An explorer is a type
of adventurer who travels to places few people
have visited before. They were the first team of
explorers to set foot on the North Pole. Peary and Henson were determined
and worked hard as a team as they experienced many adventures in the
Arctic. It took several years and eight attempts before they made it to the
North Pole, but they did not give up.


**Show Image 1A-5: Sophia Danenberg**


Another adventurer, Sophia Danenberg,
explored a different cold and snowy place. And
the place she explored was one of the most
amazing on Earth—Mount Everest!


Everest is a mountain in the Himalayas, right
between China and Nepal. ~~_[Point to Mount_~~
~~_Everest on the world map or globe.]_~~ It’s over
29,000 feet tall! ~~_How high is the ceiling in your room? So how much higher_~~
~~_than that is nine thousand feet?_~~ There are often strong winds, over one
hundred miles per hour, that blow climbers right off the side. And it’s high
above the clouds, so there isn’t much air to breathe. ~~_Does Mount Everest_~~
~~_sound like a place you would like to visit?_~~ It’s a very beautiful, faraway


Unit 10 Adventure Stories: Tales from the Edges of the World


place, and for many years people couldn’t reach the top, or summit. In
1953, explorers named Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were part of a
team that climbed Everest for two months, and finally the two men reached
the summit on May 29. About 50 years later, brave Sophia Danenberg
followed in their footsteps, reaching the top in 2006. This was an impressive
accomplishment because climbing Mount Everest is very difficult and many
who try fail to make it to the summit, even today.


**Show Image 1A-6: Jacques Cousteau**


Sophia Danenberg explored by climbing
above the clouds. But other explorers make
discoveries by diving under the water! Here’s
one of those explorers, Jacques Cousteau.
Ever since he was a boy, Cousteau loved the
ocean. He was always curious about what was
beneath its surface. He challenged himself
to find ways to spend more and more time safely under water. ~~_A challenge_~~
~~_is a difficult task or something that is hard to do._~~ He even invented a device
that allowed divers to breathe underwater, which later became the basis for
today’s scuba gear. ~~_Do you think you would ever go scuba diving? Why or why_~~
~~_not?_~~ Cousteau and his invention have helped us learn many facts about the
ocean and the creatures living in it. He also filmed many movies of what he
saw. We can still see them today and marvel at the same things he saw!


Like Cousteau, scientist Eugenia Clark was also very interested in the ocean
and its creatures. Clark was known as the Shark Lady because she spent
many years researching sharks and other fish in the same family as sharks.
She shared what she learned with the world and much of what people
understand today about sharks is because of her work.


**Show Image 1A-7: Astronaut Dr. Mae Jemison**


Sometimes adventures take people places
that aren’t even on earth. Here’s an explorer
named Dr. Mae Jemison, who explored the
most exciting place of all: space! It’s very hard
to get all the way up to space, and space is
incredibly large. That’s why most of it is still
unexplored to this day. Dr. Jemison wanted to
be one of the people who does the work of exploring it. That type of person is
called an astronaut.


Lesson 1 We’re Going on an Adventure!
**15**


**16**



Dr. Mae Jemison achieved a great deal before becoming an astronaut. She
was an excellent student in school, enjoyed studying nature and science,
and went on to become a doctor. She was also active in community service,
fluent in several languages, and enjoyed dance. After doing well in school,
particularly in science, Dr. Mae Jemison was accepted into the astronaut
program and traveled to space in 1992.


**Show Image 1A-8: Two astronauts in space**


Dr. Jemison was persistent, she worked hard
and did not give up on her goal! She was able
to become the first Black woman to explore
space. She helped many more people to
follow her up into the sky, to find the stars.
~~_Have you ever helped someone else follow_~~
~~_you on an adventure you had? Has someone_~~
~~_ever helped you?_~~


**Show Image 1A-9: A group of adventurers**


Remember what we said about adventure?
It’s going from somewhere you know to
somewhere you don’t know. All of these
adventurers did that, and they taught others
what they learned on their adventures. In
this unit, we’ll learn a little bit more about
all of them. We’ll also learn about some of
the fantastic places adventurers have explored and studied over the years,
including the Galápagos Islands and the depths of the ocean floor.


So get ready: You’re about to learn something you didn’t know before! And
that’s always an adventure.

**Language:** Students will demonstrate an understanding of the Tier 2 word _plunge_ .

~~**TEKS 1.3.B**~~


~~**PURPOSE FOR LISTENING**~~


  - Tell students that you want them to listen for reasons that Dr. Eugenie Clark

was motivated to become a zoologist.


~~**SHARK LADY (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Page 2: Tell students that gills are the part of a fish’s or shark’s body that is

used for breathing.


  - Page 3: Tell students that Atlantic City is a city on the coast of the state

of New Jersey.


  - Page 5: The phrase “through her eyes” means Dr. Clark wants people to think

of sharks the way she does—as amazing animals instead of always thinking
they are scary.


  - Page 8: The Queens County Aquarium Society is an organization that

supports aquariums.


    - We learned what a daydreamer is when we read _Mae Among the Stars_ .

What is a daydreamer? (someone who imagines things as if they are
dreaming, but they are really awake)


**TEKS 1.8.B** Describe the main character(s) and the reason(s) for their actions; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and texts the
student is able to read or hear to learn or clarify word meanings.

  - Dr. Eugenie Clark sees sharks in her daydreams.


- Page 10: A laboratory is a place where scientists study and work.


  - A sanctuary is a place where a person feels safe and peaceful.


  - Do you have a place you think of as a sanctuary where you feel safe and

peaceful? (Answers may vary but may include my room, school, a friend’s
house, etc.)


- Page 11: Define the word _zoology_ for students: the study of animals.


  - Define the word _mindless_ for students: not having thoughts or feelings.


  - Do you think Dr. Clark believed sharks did not have any thoughts or

feelings? How do you know?


- Page 13: The word _plunge_ means to do something with excitement.


- Page 16: What does the phrase “research mission” mean? You already know

what research is. What is it? _(to collect new information about a topic you_
_don’t know much about)_


  - A mission is a project with a specific purpose, so Dr. Eugenie Clark’s

research mission was a project to learn more about sharks.


- Page 17: The word _dispelled_ means to prove a belief that many people have

to be wrong.


- Page 18: Shark Lady! What a great nickname! Do you know someone who

has a nickname?


- Page 22: Have you ever trained a dog or another pet? Ask students to give

a thumbs-up or thumbs-down in response to this sentence: “It was easy to
train my pet.”


  - Can you imagine how hard it was for Dr. Eugenie Clark to train a shark?


Unit 10 Adventure Stories: Tales from the Edges of the World


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What is a zoologist? _(a person who studies animals and_

_their behavior)_


2. **Inferential.** Why did Eugenie Clark think sharks were worthy of study? _(As_

_she started learning more about sharks, she realized they could understand_
_things, her love and understanding of sharks, wanting others to love and_
_understand sharks as well, etc.)_


3. **Literal.** How does Dr. Eugenie Clark prepare to be a zoologist? _(studies,_

_works hard, swims with fish in the ocean, keeps an aquarium)_


4. **Literal.** What does it mean to be persistent? _(to work hard and never give_

_up on a goal)_


5. **Inferential.** How is Dr. Eugenie Clark persistent? _(She went diving, joined_

_the Queens County Aquarium Society, studied and took courses, set up_
_laboratories, trained sharks, etc.)_


6. **Evaluative.** Is there another character we have read about who was

persistent? _(Mae Jemison)_


Check for Understanding


**Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down:** Dr. Eugenie Clark was motivated to be a
zoologist by her love of sharks. _(thumbs-up)_


~~**WORD WORK: PLUNGE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud, you heard the sentence, “She plunged into every course

she could.”


2. Say the word _plunge_ with me.


3. In this Read-Aloud, _plunge_ means to start doing something with excitement.


4. The children plunged into learning about adventures!


5. Tell me about a time you plunged into something.


6. What is the word we have been talking about?


Use a Kinesthetic activity for follow-up. Model plunging into learning by
quickly sitting at a desk and picking up a book to read. Tell students to stand
up. Ask them to tell you something they can plunge into, and when they do

**Speaking and Listening:** Students will discuss a time they were a part of, or
observed, a team and what it was able to accomplish. ~~**[ TEKS 1.1.A ]**~~


~~**WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED? (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Today we start looking at what it is like to go on an adventure in a cold and snowy

area, and we are going to start in one of the coldest places of all: the Arctic!


**• Show Image Card 1A-4** Tell students that

in the middle of the Arctic is the North Pole.
The person who led the first expedition that
discovered the north pole was American
Admiral Robert Peary. Like Lewis & Clark
before them, Americans have made many
brave discoveries in our country’s history.
The journey to the arctic was a very difficult
journey with a small team. A key member of
his team was Matthew Henson.


  - Tell students they are going to read _Keep On! The Story of Matthew Henson,_

_Co-Discoverer of the North Pole_ by Deborah Hopkinson.


  - Ask students to give a thumbs-up for yes or thumbs-down for no in response

to this question: “Do you think Matthew Henson faced challenges on his
adventure to the North Pole?” _(thumbs-up)_


  - Tell students they will read about many challenges, but Matthew Henson had

something special that helped him on his adventure: a team.


  - Ask, “Can you tell me what a team is?” _(Answers may vary but may include a_

_group of people that work together, people who play a game together, etc.)_


  - A team is a group of people who work or compete together.


  - Think-Pair-Share: Talk to your partner about a time you, or someone you

know, were part of a team and what you did together. Ensure each student
has had an opportunity to ask and answer using the following sentence
starter, “When I was part of a team . . .”


**TEKS 1.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and answer questions using multi-word responses.


Unit 10 Adventure Stories: Tales from the Edges of the World


 - Some teams work well together, and others don’t. Ask, “What are some

qualities that make a team valuable, or important and helpful?” _(Answers may_
_vary but may include they communicate well, they help each other, they support_
_each other, they are committed to the game or job, they have fun, etc.)_

###### Introducing the Read-Aloud



5m



**Speaking and Listening:** Students will discuss the items they think are needed
for an adventure to the summit of Mount Everest. ~~**[ TEKS 1.1.A ]**~~


~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE AND TERMS (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Today we are going to look at a different cold and snowy place: Mount Everest.

Mount Everest is located in the Himalayan mountains in Nepal and is
considered to be the highest point on Earth.


  - Mount Everest is the tallest mountain on Earth. Can you imagine how difficult

it is to climb such a huge mountain?


  - Tell students the Read-Aloud is entitled _The Top of the World: Climbing Mount_

_Everest_ and it tells all about Mount Everest, including information about the
early explorers who first discovered a route to the summit.


  - Explain that the Read-Aloud tells about the first people who successfully

climbed Mt. Everest–Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Explain that
Hillary was a mountain climber from New Zealand and that Norgay was a
Sherpa and climber from Nepal. Tell students that many people attempted to
reach the summit before Hillary and Norgay were the first in 1953.


  - Tell students that they will also hear learn about climbing the mountain,

including what supplies are needed, how to get to the mountain, what
challenges climbers will face, and the dangers of climbing.


  - Think-Pair-Share: What supplies do you think a mountaineer needs to reach

the top of Mount Everest? _(Answers may vary but may include food, rope,_
_boots, a parka, etc.)_


  - Invite students to ask questions that they may have to better understand

how important it is to have the correct supplies when climbing a mountain.


~~**WHERE ARE WE?**~~


  - Review the locations already marked on the map.


  - Remind students that the Read-Aloud takes place on Mount Everest. Ask a

student to label the mountain on the map with the corresponding label.


**TEKS 1.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and answer questions using multi-word responses.


Unit 10 Adventure Stories: Tales from the Edges of the World

**Reading:** Students will describe the setting of the Read-Aloud. ~~**[ TEKS 1.8.D ]**~~


**Language:** Students will demonstrate an understanding of the Tier 2
word _adapt_ . ~~**[ TEKS 1.3.B ]**~~


~~**PURPOSE FOR LISTENING**~~


  - As you listen to the Read-Aloud, pay attention to the setting of the story.

What is a setting? _(the place and time a story takes place)_


~~**THE TOP OF THE WORLD (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Page 2: What do you think a summit is? _(the top of a mountain)_


  - Page 4: Sherpas are a group of people from Tibet and Nepal that provide

support and guide adventurers up Mount Everest. Sherpa’s primarily practice
a religion known as Buddhism, one of the world’s largest religions. They will
often worship in places they think are holy, like Mt Everest.


  - Page 6: Can you imagine climbing as high as planes fly?


    - In this picture, what kind of animal does the yak look like? _(steer, buffalo)_


  - Page 7: There are many Buddhist temples in South Asia. In Texas, there are

Buddhist temples in Dallas, Austin, Houston, and other cities.


  - Page 9: What are the names of the two men who first succeeded in reaching

the summit of Mount Everest on May 29, 1953? _(Edmund Hillary and_
_Tenzing Norgay)_


                       - **Show Image Card 9A-1** Explain to students
that this is Hillary and Norgay after their
successful climb to the summit. Why
was being the first to make it to the top
of Mount Everest such an impressive
accomplishment? _(Answers may vary but_
_may include that many had tried before them,_
_Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the_
_world, it was a very difficult task, etc.)_


**TEKS 1.8.D** Describe the setting; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and texts the student is able to read or hear to learn or clarify
word meanings.



Image Card 9A-1



Lesson 9 What Should We Bring?

**108**




  - The text says “Both men became international heroes.” What does the

author mean by that? _(It means they became famous for what they_
_accomplished and that people admired them.)_


  - Tenzig Norgay was a Sherpa. What does Sherpa mean?


- Page 9: Since 1953, thousands of people have tried to climb Mount Everest.

Hundreds have died because it is still incredibly dangerous. In fact, the
mountain is so tall that there isn’t enough air at the top for people to survive,
and most climbers bring oxygen tanks. Climbers also need to bring ladders
and ropes to make it across huge breaks in the ice and up steep cliffs.
Because it is so difficult, most people form large teams, with many people
carrying different supplies for the team. Also, most climbers rely on the local
Sherpa people to help guide them through the easiest routes.


- Page 10: George Mallory and Andrew Irvine were two British climbers who

tried to climb Mount. Everest almost thirty years before Hillary and Norgay
were successful. The mountain is so large and difficult, that Mallory and
Irvine’s expedition was lost and no one knows if they ever reached the top
before they disappeared.


- Page 10: Reinhold Messner is thought to be the greatest mountaineer of all

time. What would you be like to be known as the greatest at doing?


- Page 12: Down-filled means something that is stuffed with small, soft

feathers, like a parka.


  - Think-Pair-Share: Look at all these supplies! Which one of these supplies

do you think is the most important to have on a hike up Mount Everest?


- Page 14: That’s a long hike just to get to the mountain, and then you have to

climb up! What is the longest hike you have ever been on?


- Page 16: _Discard_ means to throw away.


  - Why would people leave trash on the mountain? _(They are too tired to_

_carry the extra weight back down, it gets lost in snowstorms, etc.)_


- Page 17: A glacier is a mass of frozen snow and ice that moves over land or

down a slope.


  - Can you stand up and show me how it might look if you were to cross the

icefall?


- Page 18: Look at the picture. What is the man in the orange coat doing?

_(crossing a ladder that sits over a chasm)_


- Page 22: Have you ever seen a video of an avalanche? What would you do if


Unit 10 Adventure Stories: Tales from the Edges of the World


you saw an avalanche coming toward you?


 - Page 24: A plume is when smoke or snow rises in the air in a puffy shape.


 - Page 26: What do you think you can do to prevent frostbite? _(Answers may_

_vary but may include wear gloves or mittens, put hand-warmers in your gloves,_
_stay out of the cold, etc.)_


 - Page 27: This page mentions the Death Zone. That sounds bad! This is the

area of the mountain where there is very little oxygen. If a climber stays in
that area too long, they could die from not getting enough oxygen.


   - _Adapt_ means to be able to adjust to a situation.


 - Page 30: The descent is the climb down a mountain.


   - How do you think you would feel on the descent? _(Answers may vary but_

_may include happy, tired, scared, etc.)_


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** Tell me again, what is a setting? _(the place and time a story takes place)_


2. **Literal.** How would you describe the setting of this Read-Aloud? _(Answers_

_may vary but may include snowy, cold, icy, windy, dangerous, steep, etc.)_


3. **Inferential.** Why do you think many expeditions failed to reach the summit

before Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were successful in 1953?
_(Answers many vary but may include bad weather, difficulty finding the way,_
_illness, injuries, the size of the mountain, etc.)_


4. **Evaluative.** Which part of the climb do you think would be the most

challenging? _(Answers may vary but may include the hike to the base of the_
_mountain, crossing the icefall, the Death Zone, the descent, etc.)_


5. **Evaluative.** If you climb Mount Everest, your body has to adapt or change

so it can function better. That is why climbers take their time. Do you think
you would be able to adapt to the conditions on Mount Everest? How
do you know?


6. **Evaluative.** Think-Pair-Share: Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay climbed

Mount Everest with a team and reached the summit together. Do you need a
team to climb Mount Everest? Why?

Before any of us could walk, we had to crawl.
Before we could crawl, we rolled around on
our bellies until we discovered that our legs
and arms could move us forward in the world.
Babies don’t know they can walk until they try
it. Even when they fall down, they get back up
and try again. Adventurers do this, too. Even
when their journeys seem impossible, adventurers keep moving toward their
goals. We are all adventurers in the making, learning to push ourselves past
limitations, ~~_or obstacles that keep you from doing something,_~~ in our minds,
into new uncharted territory ~~_, or a place that has not yet been explored or_~~
~~_mapped. Have you ever achieved a goal you thought was impossible? Have_~~
~~_you ever had to be really brave to do something?_~~

Unit 10 Adventure Stories: Tales from the Edges of the World


**Show Image 10A-3: Map of geographic**
**location of Mount Everest**


On May 19, 2006, Sophia Danenberg set out on
a challenging journey to climb Mount Everest.
Mount Everest is the top of the Himalayan
mountains in Nepal and is considered to be
the highest point on Earth.


**Show Image 10A-4: Edmund Hillary and**
**Tenzing Norgay**


It was first attempted in the 1920s by several
British explorers, including George Mallory.
The mountain is so big and was so difficult,
those expeditions never made it to the
top, and Mallory was lost on the mountain.
But finally, in 1953, with much hard work,
two explorers did reach the summit. New Zealander Edmund Hillary and
Nepalese Sherpa Tenzing Norgay made it all the way to the top.


Since 1953, thousands of people have tried to climb Everest. Hundreds have
died—it is still incredibly dangerous. In fact, the mountain is so tall that
there isn’t enough air at the top for people to survive, and most climbers
bring oxygen tanks. Climbers also need to bring ladders and ropes to make
it across huge breaks in the ice and up steep cliffs. Because it is so difficult,
most people form large teams, with many people carrying different supplies
for the team. And most climbers rely on the local Sherpa people of Nepal to
help guide them to the easiest routes.


But Sophia and two other climbers formed a small team and decided to
attempt the climb without a guide. ~~_Would you be nervous to climb Mount_~~
~~_Everest? How do you know?_~~


**Show Image 10A-5: The Eiffel Tower and**
**Statue of Liberty comparison**


In order to get to the peak, or top, of Mount
Everest, you have to climb over twenty nine
thousand feet toward the sky. Do you know
how tall that is? Have you ever seen the Eiffel
Tower in Paris, France? Climbing to the top of
Mount Everest is like climbing almost thirty


Lesson 10 She Made It!
**123**


**124**



Eiffel Towers stacked on top of each other. Have you ever seen the Statue
of Liberty in New York City? Well, if you were to stand on the summit, ~~_or the_~~
~~_highest part of a mountain,_~~ of Mount Everest, it would be like standing on top
of almost one hundred Statues of Liberty. That is pretty tall, isn’t it? ~~_What is_~~
~~_the highest place you have ever been? (Answers may vary but may include the_~~
~~_top of a roller coaster, in a plane in the sky, the top of a tall city building, etc.)_~~


Sophia had to be courageous and well prepared before attempting to reach
the summit of Mount Everest. She knew it would be a daunting task. ~~_Daunting_~~
~~_means causing doubt or worry and making you lose confidence._~~ ~~S~~ - before
Sophia ventured ~~_, which means to start on an adventure,_~~ out to climb Mount
Everest, she practiced with smaller tasks, sort of like riding a bicycle with
training wheels before you learn to ride one with no help at all. ~~_Tell me about_~~
~~_a time you had to practice something over and over until you got it right._~~


Sophia walked across ladders suspended over daring heights. She climbed
mountains in the Himalaya twice, and she even had to tackle snow, ice, and frozen
rain, ~~_or hail,_~~ while climbing. There were times when she had to turn around for
safety reasons, even when she was only a few hundred feet away from reaching
the summit. Some people might have given up after that, but Sophia never gave
up on her dream. She understood that if at first you don’t succeed, try, try again!


**Show Image 10A-6: Sophia Danenberg and**
**friends climbing Mount Everest**


And on that day, May 19, 2006, Sophia and
two other climbers decided they were ready.
There were about a dozen other climbers with
their teams on the mountain that day. Some of
the climbers were porters, ~~_or guides who knew_~~
~~_the mountains really well and helped others_~~
~~_map out the best routes for climbing._~~ Some of the climbers on the mountain
that day had other important jobs such as carrying oxygen. It can be hard to
breathe normally at high altitudes, ~~_which means the height of the land,_~~ when
you are up so high in the sky, so sometimes climbers need oxygen masks to
breathe properly. Sophia and her two friends did not have a team with them
that day. They decided to climb as their own team, with only one another to
lean upon at the most challenging heights of the mountain.


Unit 10 Adventure Stories: Tales from the Edges of the World


**Show Image 10A-7: Sophia Danenberg**
**imagining success**


Sophia and the other two climbers were so
high up that they saw the clouds and lightning
beneath their feet. The weather had taken
a turn for the worse. Still, the climbers kept
going up Mount Everest toward the stars.


**Show Image 10A-8: Sophia Danenberg at the**
**summit of Mount Everest**


Sophia started her push to the summit of
Mount Everest at 11 a.m. and finally reached
the wondrous view from the top of the tallest
place on Earth at 7 a.m. the next morning.
She made it!


Imagine what that must have been like! No, really—imagine it! Adventurers
need imagination and dreams. ~~_What do you imagine that moment would be like?_~~
When Sophia was a child, she dreamed of being a princess! As she got older, she
allowed her imagination to give life to bigger dreams. Sophia Danenberg’s hard
work and vision, ~~_or an idea of what you will do or be in the future,_~~ helped her and
her small team reach the top of Mount Everest without a guide! She did not let
anyone limit this dream she had for herself, because long before it happened,
she saw it in her mind. ~~_What do you imagine yourself doing someday?_~~


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What did Sophia Danenberg do to prepare for her climb up Mount

Everest? _(practiced crossing ladders that were really high up, climbed other_
_mountains, practiced climbing in bad weather)_


2. **Inferential.** If you were going to climb Mount Everest, what else would you

do to prepare? _(Answers may vary but may include taking climbing lessons,_
_getting the right gear, learning what climbers did to succeed, etc.)_

~~**WORD WORK: DAUNTING (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud, you heard the sentence, “She knew it would be a daunting

task.”


2. Say the word _daunting_ with me.


3. _Daunting_ means causing doubt or worry and making you lose confidence.


4. The task was daunting because it had so many parts that needed to be

completed.


5. Tell me about a time you thought something was daunting.


6. What is the word we have been talking about?

adventurers, both real and fictional. Students will study the careers of
real-world explorers Eugenie Clark and Sophia Danenberg, marvel at the
inventions of Jacques Cousteau, think critically about how teamwork
and collaboration can make greater adventures possible, learn about the
science and technology that enable adventures, and research some of the
ways humans have confronted challenges at the edges of the world, from
the oceans below to space above. This unit will be off the charts!”

  - Tell students that they will do some work with the two stories _Manfish_ and

_Keep On! The Story of Matthew Henson, Co-Discoverer of the North Pole._


  - Who are the main characters in each story? _(Jacques Cousteau and_

_Matthew Henson)_


  - What adventure did the characters go on? _(Jacques explored the oceans and_

_invented the Aqua-Lung, and Matthew Henson discovered the North Pole with_
_a team of people.)_


  - Encourage students to ask questions that they may have about Jacques

Cousteau and Matthew Henson.


  - What are your favorite events from the stories? _(Answers may vary but may_

_include Jacques Cousteau making movies, inventing the Aqua-Lung, exploring_
_with his team, and working to save the oceans; Matthew Henson working as a_
_cabin boy, meeting the Inuit, learning the skills for survival in the Arctic, falling_
_through the ice, and reaching the North Pole.)_


  - What challenges did they face? _(Answers may vary but may include Jacques_

_Cousteau finding a way to breathe underwater, learning how movie cameras_
_worked, being able to see underwater, finding a way to sail around the world to_
_explore the oceans, staying safe around the fish in the oceans, finding a way_
_to keep the oceans healthy, and telling people about the damage they were_
_doing; Matthew Henson finding a job, learning the skills to survive in the Arctic,_
_falling through the ice, and surviving the trip to the North Pole.)_

_similar, or alike between two things, and describe what is different, or not alike_
_between two things)_


  - Explain that the overlapping portion of the circles represents details that are

similar, or alike between the two stories. Explain that the parts of the circles
that do not overlap represent details about a story that are different or not
like the other story.


  - Ask student volunteers to read the clue words to identify items in a story that

are similar, or alike.


  - Ask student volunteers to read the clue words to identify items in a story that

are different, or not alike.


  - Point out that the clue words may not be written in the stories but can be

used in a sentence about the stories. (e.g., “Both Jacques Cousteau and
Matthew Henson faced challenges on their adventures.”)

in a whisper, then ask students how they think it should be done and
have a volunteer demonstrate speaking at an appropriate volume for a
presentation.


    - Look at the audience while you are speaking. Look at the ceiling and

the floor, then ask students how they think it should be done and have a
volunteer demonstrate looking other students directly in the eye.

presentation and walk away, then ask students how they think it should be
done. Have a volunteer demonstrate pretending to end their presentation
and ask, “Does anyone have any questions?”


    - Wait quietly and patiently while waiting for other guests to come to

you to hear your presentation. Pretend to try and get another student’s
attention to talk, or glance repeatedly at the clock. Then ask students how
they think it should be done and have a volunteer demonstrate how to
stand or sit while they wait.
