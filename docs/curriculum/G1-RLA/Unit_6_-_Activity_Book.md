**Dear Family Member,**


### 1.2 Take Home



Over the next several days, your student will be learning about many different types of habitats,
including the desert habitat, the rainforest habitat, and several others. Your student will learn that an
animal’s habitat provides food, water, and shelter for that specific animal. Your student will also learn
about the adaptations that plants and animals have made in order to survive in specific environments.


Below are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to continue to enjoy learning
about animals and their habitats.


**1. Safari**


In class, your student will go on a safari to look for plant and animal life around the school. Go on
a safari with your student around your neighborhood. Point out the different types of plant and animal
life. Discuss with your student how the plants and animals meet their basic needs in your neighborhood.
Point out examples of food and shelter for different animals.


**2. Habitat Terrarium**


Simulate a small habitat at home by making a small terrarium. Use a small fish tank
or some other clear container. (Plastic containers used for food would work well also.)
Add one or two inches of soil, sprinkle some grass seed on the surface, and water it as needed. Cover the
container with something that will allow the air to flow. (Cheesecloth works well.)


Once the grass has started growing, add small animals like grasshoppers. Observe the habitat for a few
days, and talk with your student about how the animals’ needs are being met or are not being met in the
mini-habitat.


**3. Words to Use**


Below are several of the words that your student has been learning about and using. Try to use these
words as they come up in everyday speech with your student.

      - _habitat_ —What kind of habitat do we live in?

      - _shelter_ —We need to find some shelter so we can get out of the rain!

      - _herbivore_ —A rabbit is a herbivore, because it only eats plants.

      - _carnivore_ —A lion is a carnivore, because it hunts and eats other animals.

      - _omnivore_ —A person is an omnivore if they eat both plants and animals.

**4. Read Aloud Each Day**


It is very important that you read to your student each day. The local library has many books on
animals and habitats.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they have learned at
school.

**Dear Family Member,**


### 4.1 Take Home



Over the past several days, your student has learned about the Arctic tundra and Arctic Ocean, the
desert habitat, and the savanna habitat. In the next few days, your student will learn about the temperate
deciduous forest habitat, the rainforest habitat, the freshwater habitat, and the saltwater habitat. Your
student will continue to learn about adaptations that plants and animals have made in order to survive
in the specific habitats mentioned above. Your student will also learn about endangered species and the
causes of extinction.


Below are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to continue to enjoy learning
about animals and habitats.


**1. Habitats**


Ask your student which of the habitats they like best and why. Discuss with your student what types
of plants and animals live there and how those plants and animals are adapted to that habitat.


**2. Animals and Habitats Drawing**


Have your student draw a picture of one or several of the habitats they have learned about thus far.
Talk with your student about the weather and climate of the habitat. Be sure your student includes the
plants and animals that live in that habitat. Have your student think about what they would have to do to
adapt to the climate, and then draw themselves in the picture with their adaptations.


**3. Where in the World?**


Use a world map or globe to locate each of the habitats your student has learned about thus far (Arctic

[tundra and ocean], Sonoran Desert, East African Savanna). Show your student where Texas is in relation
to each of these habitats.


**4. Salt Water**


In a few days, your student will be learning about the saltwater habitat. As preparation, you may want
to help your student differentiate between salt water and fresh water. Mix a half-teaspoon of salt with one
cup of water. Have your student dip their finger in the salt water and place it on their tongue. Then have
them sip some drinking water. Discuss the difference in taste between the two.

Be sure to explain that people should not drink a lot of salt water because it is not good for their
health.


**5. Ocean or Saltwater Habitat Collage**


Have your student make an ocean or saltwater collage. Have your student paint or color a piece of
paper blue. Next, have them look through magazines or journals to find pictures of animals that live in
the ocean. If no magazines or journals are available, have your student draw and cut out the animals from
construction paper and glue them onto the blue paper.


**6. Pollution and Habitat Destruction**


Your student will be learning about how pollution can cause animals’ habitats to be destroyed. The
next time you are out with your student, point out examples of pollution. Have your student also look for
examples of pollution.


**7. Read Aloud Each Day**


It is very important that you read to your student each day.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they have learned at
school.
