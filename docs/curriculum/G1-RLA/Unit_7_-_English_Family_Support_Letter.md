# **Welcome!**


#### **Grade 1, Unit**
## **Fairy Tales**


#### **Grade 1, Unit**



Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will be introduced to fairy tales that have been favorites with children
for generations.

### **What's the story?**

Students will learn about favorite **fairy tales** and the elements that distinguish them as a
**unique** type of **[fiction](https://4FWLRQ.bb)** .

### **What will my student learn?**

Through daily Read-Alouds, students will explore fairy tales that exemplify **bravery**
**and** **heroism**, teach literacy concepts such as **good versus evil**, and provide **valuable**
**life** **lessons** . They will develop a **strong foundation** for understanding other types of
fictiona l stories in later grades .

**Note:** Teachers will be reminding students that long ago, the Brothers Grimm thought that these
stories would be interesting for people to hear because they are about things that make people
happy, sad, and sometimes afraid. Parts of some of these traditional fairy tales may be considered
somewhat scary for young students. It is important to remind students that the stories are fic tion
and be prepared to discuss any potentially scary parts with them, if necessary. Additionally,
these are traditional fairy tales and an important literary genre as de fi ned by the TEKS.


Students will explore the genre of narrative writing in this unit by **planning**, **writing**, and
**editing** a retelling of their favorite fairy tale.

Later in the unit, students will explore characters in fairy tales from around the world. They
will also write friendly letters to characters to better understand their actions.

### **Conversation starters**

1. What is "the land of Nod"?

**Follow up:** Can you give me an example of when you might be in "the land of Nod"?

2. Tell me about the fairy tale "Sleeping Beauty."

**Follow up:** What was the setting of that story? Who were the characters? What were
some of the magical events (fantasy) that happened? How did this fairy tale end?

3. How would you describe the character Rumplestiltskin?

character? How do you know?

4. Who are some of the heroic characters in the fairy tales you have been reading?

the character's action? Why or why not?
