Ask your student questions about the unit to promote discussion and continued learning:


1. What are some of the features of the earth you have been learning about?

**Follow up:​** What is the equator? Can you show me where the equator is on the
globe? (If you do not have a globe, have your student point to where the equator
would be on something that is shaped like a globe, such as an orange, a ball, etc.)

2. Tell me about the layers of the earth.

**Follow up: ​** Which layer is the one we live on? Describe the crust of the earth to me.
What things are found in the crust of the earth?
