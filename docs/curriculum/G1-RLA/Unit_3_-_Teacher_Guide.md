Introduction

~~**WHY EARLY AMERICAN CIVILIZATIONS ARE IMPORTANT**~~


This unit includes a study of the Maya, Aztec, and Inca civilizations. Students will examine the
fundamental features of the Maya, Aztec, and Inca, including farming and the establishment of cities
and government. Students will be encouraged to compare and contrast each of these societies and
their elements. Specifically, students will learn about the ancient Mayan city of Baakal and about the
Mayan king, Pakal II. Students will also learn about Moctezuma, the Aztec ruler, and the Aztec city
of Tenochtitlan. For the Inca, students will hear about the city of Machu Picchu. Last, students will
learn that much of what we know about the Maya, the Aztec, and the Inca today is due to the work of
archaeologists.


In later grades, students will build upon the knowledge of civilizations that they gain by listening to
and discussing the Read-Alouds in this unit; the concepts and factual information that they learn
now will also serve as building blocks for later, more in-depth, learning.


The text that students will be reading and discussing provides opportunities for students to build
content knowledge and draw connections to social studies. You may build on class discussions to
support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of Geography, Government,
History, and Culture from the Social Studies TEKS. This content is not a replacement for grade level
social studies instruction. For more information about the quantitative and qualitative measures
used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher
Resources.


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED**~~


The following units, and the specific core content that was targeted in those units, are particularly
relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _Early American Civilizations_ . This background
knowledge will greatly enhance your students’ understanding of the Read-Alouds they are about to
enjoy:


**Colonial and Native Americans (Kindergarten)**


**Kings and Queens (Kindergarten)**


Unit 3 Early American Civilizations : Aztecs, Maya, Incas


~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR EARLY AMERICAN CIVILIZATIONS**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _Early American Civilizations_ in the
forms in which they appear in the Read-Alouds or, in some instances, in the “Introducing the ReadAloud” section at the beginning of the lesson. Boldfaced words in the list have an associated Word
Work activity. The inclusion of the words on this list does not mean that students are immediately
expected to be able to use all of these words on their own. However, through repeated exposure
throughout the lessons, they should acquire a good understanding of most of these words and begin
to use some of them in conversation.

Unit 3 Early American Civilizations : Aztecs, Maya, Incas


~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit, students will explore the genre of informational writing. They will learn to identify
important facts and information before, during, and after informational Read-Alouds. They will
practice collecting and synthesizing information by note-taking as a group with Civilization Charts
and other graphic organizers. Students will work independently to write one-phrase or onesentence responses to Read-Alouds and activities throughout the unit. In Lesson 2, you will model
informational paragraph writing. Then in small groups, students will synthesize their response
statements into a paragraph.


The following activities may be added to students’ writing portfolios to showcase student writing
within and across units:


  - Civilization Chart responses (Lessons 1–3, 5–7, 9, 10)


  - Write About It informational paragraphs (Lessons 4, 8, 10)


  - Any additional writing completed during Pausing Point, Unit Review, or Culminating Activities

Unit 3 Early American Civilizations : Aztecs, Maya, Incas


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Introducing the Read-Aloud**

  - Display a world map to locate the Maya in Mexico and the Yucatán Peninsula
of Central America. Alternatively, you may access a digital version of a map
showing the early American civilizations in the online materials for this unit.


  - Prepare and display a timeline, and be prepared to add Image Card 3 on
the range of 1000 BC–1542 AD. Explain to students that scholars today use
BC and AD to date historic events, but students may sometimes see BCE/
CE. Alternatively, you may access a digital version of a timeline in the online
materials for this unit. You may also choose to create and maintain a class
timeline throughout the entire year, showing 3000 BC–present.


**Application**

  - Prepare and display a Civilization Chart like the one below for the Maya on
a wall or board in your classroom. Each section should be large enough to
contain an Image Card. You will add at least one card to this chart at the end of
each of the first four lessons. Leave the chart displayed throughout the unit.

**Note to Teacher**


The first four lessons of this unit focus on the Maya. It is important to
understand that the Maya were a unique civilization in that they did not have
a single ruler or economy. City-states, rather, acted independently with their
own power structures, laws, traditions, customs, and economies. The Maya
were united, however, through political bonds between those city-states. In
the Read-Alouds that follow, we present information on a large and important
city-state, Baakal.

**Universal Access**

 - Gather images of a tropical rainforest, a satellite image of a hurricane, and an
image of a sapodilla tree, and images/samples of various items that are and
are not things that are harvested (maize, a kitten, a mailbox, wheat, green
beans, etc.) to share with students.


Be sure to follow your school’s policy regarding food distribution and
allergies.


 - Prepare and display a characters chart with the following characters on chart
paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard. Alternatively, a digital version may be
accessed in the online materials for this unit.

**Note:** If students share misunderstandings, it is not necessary to correct
them at this point. However, make sure that misunderstandings are
addressed and corrected during appropriate Read-Alouds.


 - Tell students that the first of the civilizations they will learn about is the
Mayan civilization. Explain that the Maya were unique because they did
not have a single government. Each city-state that made up the Mayan
civilization had its own government, traditions, and economy. Still, as they
will learn in the next several lessons, some things were similar across these
different city-states.

**Show Image 1A-1: Pik is worried**

~~_Tell me what you notice about this image. You_~~

~~_are going to hear about the boy in this image in_~~

~~_the Read-Aloud._~~


Once there was a Mayan boy named Kanal

[/ ko*nol/]. Kanal lived with his family about

1,300 years ago in an area that is now called the

Yucatán Peninsula. ~~_A peninsula is a piece of land nearly surrounded by water._~~


One day Kanal was working in a field near the village where his family lived,

when he saw another Mayan boy coming his way. ~~_[Point to the image of Kanal_~~

~~_and the point to the image of his cousin, Pik.]_~~ It was his cousin, Pik. Kanal

smiled and said, “Hello. How are you?”


Pik had been lost in thought. He answered, “Fine, thanks.”


But he looked unhappy, so Kanal asked, “What’s wrong?”


Pik said, “My father told me that he is certain there is a **hurricane** headed

this way. He says that he knows a hurricane is coming because the wind has

been whistling more loudly through the holes and conch shells in the walls

of the buildings. He is worried about being able to **harvest** the **maize** in our

~~_father is worried about being able to harvest, or gather, all the maize in time._~~


**Show Image 1A-2: Maize**

Maize, or corn, was the main crop the Maya

grew for food a thousand years ago, as it still is

today. Like most plants we grow for food, maize

should be picked when the time is right, to get

it at its best. Kanal knew this, so he understood

why Pik was upset. ~~_Why is Pik upset?_~~ ~~(Pik is~~

~~afraid that the hurricane will destroy their crop~~

~~of maize, and then his family will not have enough food to eat.)~~


“That’s terrible!” Kanal said. “Let us go find my father. He will know what to

do. He is one of the wisest men in the village.” So the two boys started down

the dirt path toward their village.


**Show Image 1A-3: Mayan village**

As they drew nearer, they saw the houses

ahead, each one made of mud, stone, and

When she saw the boys, she smiled. Kanal asked her, “Has Father returned

from fishing?”


“Not yet,” said Ikal. “If you are looking for him, he said he would probably try

the place where he caught the big fish last week.”


So the two boys continued on through the village. An old woman smiled

and waved them over. “Here is a little something for you boys,” she said.

She handed them some chicle [/chee*klae/]. “Fresh from the sapodilla

[/ sap* ə *dil* ə /] tree,” she smiled. Chicle is like chewing gum, and the boys

popped some into their mouths, said “thank you,” and continued on their way.

**Show Image 1A-4: At the riverbank**

Ten minutes later, they reached the riverbank.

A little upstream, Kanal’s father, Tun [/toon/],

stood knee-deep in water while the other

village men were getting out of a canoe. ~~_[Point_~~

~~_to the canoe in the picture.] What is a canoe?_~~

~~_A canoe is a narrow, open boat that is moved_~~

~~_through the water with paddles._~~ Tun was strong



and very smart, and everyone liked him. Kanal and Pik watched as Tun and

the other men dragged a fishing net from the canoe to the **shore** . ~~_The shore_~~

~~_is the land at the edge of the river._~~ As the boys hurried forward, Tun and the

other men drew the fish in the net onto the riverbank and looked up.


“Hello, Pik,” he said. “Kanal, what are you doing here?”


“Father,” Kanal replied, “Uncle believes that a hurricane is headed this way.

He is worried about the maize. It could be destroyed if it is not completely

harvested before the hurricane hits.”


Tun listened, and then turned to Pik. “My brother can normally tell about

these types of things,” he said. “We are family. We will all help you pick your

The boys grinned with excitement. “Thank you,

Uncle,” said Pik. “I will tell my father.” He ran

off to tell him the news.







Kanal looked down and saw that his father

had caught many fish. He picked some up,

and Tun took the rest. Then they headed back

to the village.

As they came to their village, Tun stopped each

time he saw other relatives to ask if they would

help harvest the maize for Zuk. Everyone

agreed to help. Families all depended on each

other in their efforts to grow plants, hunt and

fish, and even build or repair one another’s homes. Each person knew that

when it was his or her turn to ask for help, the extended family would be

there. ~~_An extended family includes people like aunts, uncles, grandparents,_~~

~~_and cousins._~~


By the time Kanal and Tun reached home, everything was arranged.


Tun said, “This afternoon, your Uncle Zuk will find that he and Pik have all the

help they need harvesting the maize. Then we need to prepare our house for

the hurricane.”


**Show Image 1A-7: Helping Zuk**

That afternoon, Kanal, Tun, and all their

**The More the Merrier**

  - Ask students if they have ever heard the saying “the more the merrier.”


  - Tell students that “the more the merrier” is a shorter way of saying the more
people there are, the merrier, or happier, we will be. Have students repeat the
saying after you.


  - Explain to students that in the Read-Aloud, they heard how Pik and his father,
Zuk, were able to harvest their maize before the hurricane arrived, because
their extended family of aunts, uncles, and cousins (i.e., more people) came
to help.


  - Ask students if they think that the saying “the more the merrier” applies to
that part of the story, and ask why or why not. _(Yes, because having more_
_people allowed Pik and Zuk to harvest their maize in time.)_

**Show Image 2A-1: The hurricane passes**

Luckily, although the winds of the hurricane

were very noisy, the storm did not damage

Kanal’s home very much at all. A week after the

hurricane, Tun announced to his family, “This

was the largest crop of maize our field has ever





given to us. The rain from the hurricane was

good for our crops. Your mother and I have



decided that all of us should go to Baakal [/bak*al/] for the Festival of the

First Star to trade our maize for other goods and services. ~~_Baakal is a city that_~~

**Show Image 2A-2: Kanal’s family excited**
**about the journey**

Well, you can imagine the excitement. Kanal’s

sister, Ikal, couldn’t stay still. She kept rushing

back and forth between her father and mother,

hugging each of them. Their mother, Chanil [/

chon*eel/], was the most delighted of all. She

told them, “Wait until you see Baakal. There



is no other place like it, they say, except of course for Puh, the greatest city

in the world. But I have seen Baakal, and I cannot imagine any place more

wonderful.”


The children knew that their mother had seen Baakal twice before—once

with her parents, and once with Tun. Going there was a special occasion

because Baakal was so far away.


**Show Image 2A-3: Leaving for Baakal**

It did not take them long to prepare, because

their extended family members would make

sure that everything at home would be all right

while they were away. Early the next morning,

they all set out. Pik’s brothers and sisters,

who were too young to make such a long trip,

stayed behind with their mother. But Pik and

his father, Zuk, joined Kanal’s family, and they all entered canoes at the

riverside. These canoes had been made by cutting down and hollowing out

great trees from the forest. ~~_How are they going to Baakal?_~~ ~~(by canoe)~~ ~~_Have_~~

~~_you ever been in a canoe or seen one before?_~~


The paddles noiselessly slid through the water. They were all used to

traveling this way to other nearby villages. “But this time,” thought Kanal as

they moved away from the shore, “we are going all the way to Baakal.”


**Show Image 2A-4: The travelers put ashore**
**at night**

It took them three days to reach Baakal. ~~_When_~~

~~_it takes three days to get someplace, is that_~~

~~_a long time or a short time?_~~ At night, they

stopped at other small villages, dragging their

canoes ashore, or onto the shore, so they

would not drift away. Overnight, the six of

them stayed with other extended family, who would also provide them with

food for the night and the next day.

**Show Image 2A-5: The wide plain**

At about noon on the third day, the river

brought them out from among the trees onto

an enormous, flat **plain** . ~~_[Here,_~~ ~~plain~~ ~~_means a_~~
~~_large, flat area of land._~~ ~~Plain~~ ~~_can also be used to_~~

~~_describe something as simple or clear.]_~~ Kanal,

Pik, and Ikal had never seen such a giant space

without forest covering it. The two fathers,



knowing this, stopped paddling, so the young people could just stare.


~~_Why do you think that the children had never seen a plain before?_~~ ~~(They live in~~

~~the tropical rainforest where there are lots of trees and other plants growing~~

~~close together.)~~ Tun told them, “Many rivers flow into this plain and right

through it. On the far side, some of them join into a mighty river that flows all

the way to the Great Water!” By this he meant the ocean, which none of them

had ever seen.


They resumed their paddling, and a few hours later, Zuk called out in

excitement, “Look! Baakal!” He pointed off in the distance, and the others

strained to see what he saw.


They could just make out high, bright red towers. They were all **thrilled**, ~~_or_~~

~~_very excited,_~~ but to Tun, the best part of the moment was hearing the

excitement in his brother’s voice, for Zuk rarely let himself get excited.


**Show Image 2A-6: Arriving in Baakal**

A few more hours brought them to the very

edge of the great city. As they came closer,

more and more canoes and other boats

crowded onto the river from other streams

and tributaries—that is, smaller rivers that





joined into the big one. Everyone was there

to celebrate the maize harvest. By the time



they reached Baakal, the water was covered with people in boats, and there

were just as many people approaching on nearby roads. ~~_Why do you think_~~

~~_there were other people in boats everywhere? (Answers may vary but should_~~

~~_include that there is a festival or that this is a big city.)_~~


Baakal was everything their parents had said it was. Pik called back over his

shoulder to Kanal, “I can hardly wait to see it all.” Chanil, Kanal’s mother,

laughed. “We will be lucky to see even a part of it; there is so much to see.”


Unit 3 Early American Civilizations : Aztecs, Maya, Incas


Tun, grabbing the end of the canoe as he waded through the water toward

the shore, said, “Tomorrow we will see the greatest towers for ourselves.

Then you will truly know the wonder of Baakal!”

**Recall:** Why did Kanal and his family travel to the Mayan city of
Baakal? _(to celebrate the good harvest of maize this year, and to_
_trade the maize for other goods and services; to attend the Festival_
_of the First Star)_


1. **Literal.** How did Kanal and his family travel to the Mayan city of Baakal? _(in_
_canoes, along the river)_

   - **Literal.** How long did it take for them to reach Baakal? _(a long time,_
_three days)_


   - **Inferential.** Where did they stay as they were traveling? _(with relatives_
_in villages along the way)_ How did they find food along the way? _(Their_
_relatives shared food with them.)_


2. **Inferential.** Was extended family an important part of Mayan culture? _(yes)_
How do you know? ( _Answers may vary, but should include examples of how_
_families depended on each other when they needed help.)_

this passage? _(they enjoy celebrating harvest, they value their extended_
_families, and they attend festivals)_

Here, _wonder_ means
the thing(s) that cause
admiration. So “the
wonder of Baakal” means
the things that make
Baakal a great city.
_Wonder_ can also mean to
want to know something.

Ikal, and his cousin Pik—stood looking up at the most amazing building any

of them had ever seen. It was nine stories high, each story smaller than the

one below it. ~~_[Have students count the stories in this image.]_~~ Wide stone steps

ran up two of the four sides, reaching to the top level on which there stood a

small building. It was made of stone, like the nine-stepped **pyramid** on which it

“Can we see it ourselves, Father?” Ikal asked.


“No. It is a special place. Only King Pakal’s son, our great king Chan Bahlum

[/kon/] [/bo*lom/], is allowed inside the pyramid.”


The children looked up with even greater interest, knowing that this was a

place so special that only a king might enter it. Tun glanced around to see

that no one else was listening, then added in a mysterious tone, “They say

King Pakal wanted treasure to be put inside when he died. Some say the

pyramid is full of treasure from top to bottom.”


**Show Image 3A-3: Treasure found in Pakal's**
**pyramid**

The three children turned to look at him with

wide eyes, unsure if he was teasing or serious.

He went on, “Some say there is green jade

carved to make all sorts of fabulous jewelry,





bowls, tools, perhaps even furniture. ~~_Jade is_~~

~~_a type of stone._~~ No one knows exactly.” ~~_This_~~



~~_picture shows part of the king’s pyramid, a sculpture of King Pakal, and a_~~

~~_tablet located on an interior wall._~~


Chanil added, “Except for our king, Chan Bahlum. It was he who put it there.

That is, if the tale is true.” ~~_A tale is a story. What is the other meaning of story?_~~


Pik looked at his father, Zuk. “Do you think it is true, Father? Is there really

treasure?” ~~_Do you think there really was treasure? What do you think these_~~

~~_three images show?_~~


Unit 3 Early American Civilizations : Aztecs, Maya, Incas


**Show Image 3A-4: King Pakal**

Zuk was still staring up at the building. He

answered thoughtfully, “I saw King Pakal once,

long ago. He was dressed in robes woven of

the finest cotton in many colors, and he wore

a headdress of magnificent feathers from

the rarest birds. He wore magnificent jade

necklaces, and carried a scepter carved into



wonderful shapes.” ~~_A scepter is a wand or rod that can symbolize royal power._~~


“He did not walk on the earth, as we do, but was carried through the streets

on a great chair that sat atop two long poles laid flat. Important noblemen,

for whom carrying the king through the streets was a great honor, carried the

king anywhere he wanted to go.” He turned to look at his son. “I think that if

King Pakal wanted a treasure of jade inside his pyramid, then yes, there must

be jade.”


The children looked at one another in wonder, then back at the pyramid. But

Tun and Chanil looked at one another, silently sharing a different thought.

They were both thinking, “I have not heard Zuk speak so many words at once

in many years.” Finally Tun said to the others, “Let us go see what is on the

other side of King Pakal’s pyramid. I heard from a man in the **market** this

morning that King Chan Bahlum is **constructing** more great buildings over

there.” ~~_To construct means to build something._~~


So they hurried off to see what other sights there might be.


**Show Image 3A-5: Other sights in Baakal**

Sure enough, Pakal’s son, King Chan Bahlum,

had ordered a whole series of buildings to be

built. These new buildings were wonderful in

their own way, for the roof lines on top were

carved in wonderful designs.

**Show Image 3A-6: Resting under a tree**

After a while, Kanal asked, “Father, why did

King Pakal make such a wonderful pyramid? It

is much greater than the places you showed us

this morning.”


Tun answered quietly. “I will tell you, but you

must not repeat it.” The three children grew



quiet, sensing that he was about to trust them with some special, grown-up

sort of secret. Then Tun began to tell them about King Pakal. ~~_What do you_~~

~~_think the secret about King Pakal could be? Why do you think King Pakal built_~~

~~_such a great pyramid? [Pause to record students’ predictions for review and_~~

1. **Literal.** What kind of leader ruled the Maya? _(a king)_


2. **Evaluative.** When telling the children about King Pakal, why do you think Zuk
spoke more words than he had in years? _(Answers will vary, but may include_

2. Say the word _constructing_ with me.


3. _Constructing_ means building something or putting something together.


4. The workers spent eight months constructing the new house.


5. What other kinds of things do you think would be worth constructing?
Try to use the word _constructing_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three
students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses: “I think
constructing a would be good because . . ."]

think that is why he built such a great pyramid in Bakaal. ~~_So why did people_~~

~~_think King Pakal built such a magnificent pyramid?_~~ ~~(to show what a great~~

~~ruler he was)~~


“I do not know if that is why he built such a great pyramid, but I know that to

this day, King Pakal was the greatest king who ever ruled Baakal. And now his

son, King Chan Bahlum, is a great ruler like his father.


**Show Image 4A-3: Resting under a tree**

“But all this is something we do not talk about

openly, for King Chan Bahlum might not like

it. He does not want anyone to remember that

there was a question about his father being

king, for then they might say the same thing





about him. Do you all understand why I say

these things softly?” ~~_Do you understand why_~~



~~_Tun told the story quietly? Chan Bahlum is afraid someone will say he cannot_~~

~~_be king because his father, King Pakal, was the son of the queen._~~


The children whispered, “Yes,” all at the same time. They felt very grown-up

to have been told this story, and for a while they were quiet as they and the

grown-ups rose to their feet and went on exploring the great city.


**Show Image 4A-4: The market**

Swiveling his head side to side, determined not

to miss anything, Pik told Kanal, “I never knew

there could be buildings so big.”


“Yes,” Kanal agreed, “or such a big market,





with so many things for sale and so many

people buying and selling.”



“Or so much noise!” Ikal said, and her brother laughed. “Well, it’s true!” she

protested. “Our village is never this noisy.” ~~_[Point out how Ikal is covering her_~~

Challenge


Why might the Maya think
Venus was a star? How
is a star different from a
planet?


**54**



The Maya believed the stars and **planets** were in the sky to act as a calendar

that would help with growing crops, so for hundreds of years, the Maya

studied the sky very carefully. ~~_Planets are large bodies in outer space along_~~

~~_with the sun, moon, and stars._~~ The Maya believed that the stars and planets

controlled different things, like when crops could grow and how the tide in the

ocean moves. They had no **telescopes** to make distant things look closer and

clearer; no one had **invented** a telescope yet. ~~_No one had made a telescope, an_~~

~~_instrument for looking at things as far away as the stars, yet._~~


But the Maya built what we call **observatories** for studying the sky. To

observe means to look carefully at something. So an observatory is a place

to observe the sky. The ancient Maya built observatories atop buildings and

high places, and the Maya leaders studied the sky from them. The ancient

Maya built observatories atop temples and high places, and the Maya

priests studied the sky from them. ~~_Why do you think the Maya built their_~~

~~_observatories on top of pyramids?_~~


The Maya scheduled their holidays and many other events to match the

movements of stars and planets. Over many years, the Maya figured out

exactly when planets and stars would appear in certain places in the sky.

They used this knowledge to create the most **accurate** calendar in the

world. ~~_The word_~~ ~~accurate~~ ~~_means correct or without error._~~ The Mayans kept

track of their calendar by making inscriptions, or carved writings into stone.

They also used their **calendar** to plan festivals, like the Festival of the First

Star. ~~_Who can tell me what festivals are?_~~ ~~(big celebrations)~~


**Show Image 4A-6: Two views of Venus**

Today, we know that the Festival of the First

Star was not really about a star at all. What

Chanil called “the first star” is really a planet

that looks like a star. We call this planet

“Venus,” and like our own planet Earth, Venus





travels in a wide circle around the sun. It is


Unit 3 Early American Civilizations : Aztecs, Maya, Incas


often the first star-like light we see in the evening sky when it is beginning to

get dark. Of course, without a telescope, the Maya could not see Venus

clearly enough to know it was a planet, so they called it a star. To them it was

the “first star,” and very important.


**Show Image 4A-7: Festival of Venus**

So the festival celebrated the time each year

when the “first star” (which was actually

Venus) appeared at a certain place in the

sky. People came from far away to take part.





During the festival, there would be singing

and dancing, and the Mayan people would



celebrate all of the good things that had happened! ~~_[Explain to students that_~~

~~_now you will return to the story.]_~~


While Kanal, Pik, and their families were visiting the city of Baakal, thousands

of other Mayan families were visiting, too.


**Show Image 4A-8: King Chan Bahlum**

They watched the appearance of King Chan

Bahlum with special excitement, as he was

carried to the foot of a pyramid, walked slowly

up the wide steps to the top, and disappeared

into the pyramid. They waited the whole time





he was inside, and when he reappeared, they

cheered mightily, showing their excitement for



the start of the festivities.


As the celebration stretched into the night, Kanal’s family looked around in

wonder. But the greatest wonder was what was happening to Zuk. For as he

watched the excitement and joy in his son’s face, Zuk’s face began to show those

emotions, too. ~~_Why was Zuk’s excitement such a great wonder to his family?_~~


**Show Image 4A-9: Sleeping children**

Well into the night, Pik fell asleep, and Zuk

gently lifted his son into his own powerful

arms and carried him, smiling down at his

son’s face. Kanal was awake long enough to

see all this before he, too, fell asleep and was





picked up by his own father. Ikal had already

night’s sleep, before beginning the long canoe journey home.


**Show Image 4A-10: Journeying home**

The morning fog cleared in the first hour of

their journey home. Pik, turning to call to his

cousin Kanal in the other canoe, nearly lost

his balance and fell into the river. His father

grabbed him by the shoulder and steadied him





in the canoe. And then Zuk laughed and joked,

“My son, you are not a turtle. Do not leap into

smiled to himself and dipped his paddle once more into the water, glad to be

~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


Check for Understanding


**Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down:** In the previous Read-Aloud, you
predicted why you thought King Pakal built such a great pyramid
in Baakal. [Read each of the predictions you recorded in Lesson
3.] Give me a thumbs up if your predictions were correct, and a
thumbs down if not. How was your prediction different from what
really happened? _(Answers will vary, but should include that King_
_Pakal built the pyramid to prove he was a great ruler and didn’t_
_want people to question his right to be king.)_


1. **Literal.** How did the Maya study the stars and planets? _(They built_
_observatories at the tops of buildings and high places.)_

   - **Literal.** Why did the Maya study the stars and planets? _(They believed the_
_stars and planets gave them information about their land, such as when to_
_plant and harvest their crops and when they should have their festivals.)_


2. **Inferential.** Why was the Read-Aloud called “The Maya: The Festival of the
First Star”? _(The Read-Aloud was about how Kanal and his family attended_
_the Festival of the First Star, which was a special Mayan celebration.)_


Unit 3 Early American Civilizations : Aztecs, Maya, Incas


3. **Literal.** The Read-Aloud said the Maya created a very accurate calendar.
We have calendars today, too, but long, long ago someone had to invent
calendars to keep track of the days, weeks, and months. How did the Maya
make their calendar? What did they observe? _(They looked at the stars and_
_planets. They watched the movement of the stars and planets in the sky each_
_night and used this knowledge to create an accurate calendar.)_


4. **Evaluative.** _What? Pair Share:_ Asking questions after a Read-Aloud is one
way to see how much everyone has learned. In a moment you are going to
ask your neighbor a question about the Read-Aloud that starts with the word
_what_ . For example, you could ask, “What did the Maya build to study the stars
and planets?” Turn to your neighbor and ask your what question. Listen to
your neighbor’s response. Then your neighbor will ask a new _what_ question,
and you will get a chance to respond. I will call on several of you to share your
questions with the class.


~~**WORD WORK: ACCURATE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “[The Maya] used their knowledge of the stars
and planets to create the most accurate calendar in the world.”


2. Say the word _accurate_ with me.


3. When something is accurate, it is correct, or right.


4. Students hoped that their answers on the test would be accurate.


5. Tell about something or some time when it is important that you be accurate.
Try to use the word _accurate_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three
students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses: “I try to
make sure is/are accurate by . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use an Antonyms activity for follow-up.** When something is the opposite
of accurate, it is inaccurate. Say the word inaccurate with me. I will read
some phrases and sentences. If what I say is an example of something that is
accurate, say, “That is accurate.” If you hear something that is the opposite
of accurate say, “That is not accurate”


    - The sun comes up in the morning. _(That is accurate.)_


    - You use your feet when you read. _(That is not accurate.)_


    - When it rains, clouds fall from the sky. _(That is not accurate.)_

**Speaking and Listening:** Students will identify the characteristics of a folktale.


~~**TEKS 1.9.A**~~


~~**WHERE ARE WE? (5 MIN.)**~~


  - On a world map, have students locate the area where the Maya lived. _(the_
_tropical rainforests in Mexico and Central America, in and around what we now_
_call the Yucatán Peninsula)_


  - Next, point to central Mexico (around Mexico City), and explain to students
that the next civilization they will be hearing about, the Aztec civilization, was
also located in what is now Mexico, north of the Maya.


  - Tell students one place they will hear about in today’s Read-Aloud is Lake
Texcoco [/tex*koe*koe/], a natural lake in the valley of central Mexico.


  - Point to Lake Texcoco on the map.


**TEKS 1.9.A** Demonstrate knowledge of distinguishing characteristics of well-known children’s literature such as folktales,

~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION OR TERMS (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Explain to students that the type of story they will hear today is called a legend.


  - Tell students that legends are kind of like folktales; they often tell a story
about why things are the way they are.


Check for Understanding


**Recall:** What were some of the folktales you heard during the
_Sharing Stories_ unit? _(“The Little Half-Chick [Medio Pollito],” “The_
_Crowded, Noisy House,” “The Tale of Peter Rabbit,” “The Boy Who_
_Cried Wolf”)_ What are some of the important characteristics of
folktales? _(fiction stories made up long ago that were told again_
_and again from one generation to the next, usually explain why an_
_event or a place is important, etc.)_


  - You may wish to draw parallels between legends and the folktales students
have heard.


  - Explain to students that legends may or may not be true, but there is no way
to prove that they are true. Often, however, many people know and repeat a
legend as an explanation for something.

**Show Image 5A-1: Journeying Aztec**
~~_Describe the people in this picture. Who do you_~~
~~_think these people are? Where do you think they_~~

The Aztec people had been walking every day

complete the long journey. Some new Aztec had been born on the way, and

were passing their first days of life in the constant motion of travel. They took

short breaks to eat, stopping only at night to sleep.


**Show Image 5A-2: The Aztec leader**

Now the Aztec were in the center of a great

**valley** . ~~_A valley is an area of low land between_~~

~~_hills or mountains._~~ The men at the front of the

long line strode once more to the old leader.

~~_[Point to the leader in the illustration.]_~~ “Is this





the right place for us to stop?” the men asked.

“Is this our new home?”

The leader was very old. His long hair was gray and wrinkles furrowed his

brow, but he stood as straight as the mightiest warrior. When he spoke, it

was always with a voice that was strong and sure. Once again he told them,

“No, not yet. Our stories tell us to look for certain **elements** in nature. ~~_[An_~~

~~_element is an important and necessary part of something.]_~~ These elements

are important to us. All of our people know these elements. When we see one,

we will know it is time to stop.” So their journey continued.

Finally, one day their forward **scouts** came

back to report, ~~_Scouts are people who travel_~~

“There is a great lake ahead, in the center is

an **island** . ~~_What is an island?_~~ ~~(An island is land~~

~~that is completely surrounded by water.)~~ There



are no signs of enemies anywhere. There are not even any people to be seen.”


“Then we will camp on the shore,” said the Aztec leaders. “We can all use a

rest, and we can wash the dust off ourselves.” So, they all moved forward.


After several hours, they reached the lakeshore.


**Show Image 5A-4: On the island**

Suddenly, the leader’s eyes opened wide.

He raised his hand and pointed. “Look!” he

exclaimed. “On the island.”


The people all turned to see what the old





leader had seen. On the island stood a tall,

green cactus. ~~_[Point to the cactus in the_~~



~~_image.]_~~ Sitting atop it, unharmed by the cactus’ sharp thorns, was a great

bird, an eagle. One of its powerful hooked talons, or claws, held the eagle

steady on the cactus branch. In its other talon was a long, wriggling snake. As

the Aztec people looked on in wonder, the eagle began to eat the snake.


The older Aztec people knew they were seeing something important. They

had all been told the story of the eagle and the snake when they were

children. “This is our new home!” the people all muttered as they gathered

along the green lakeshore.


Lesson 5 The Aztec: The Legend of the Eagle and the Serpent
**71**


A small boy knelt on the ground beside his mother, tugging at her robe

and asking, “What does this mean?” The mother gathered her son close to

her and promised that he would hear the story of the Aztec people before

the end of the day. For now, they sat in **awe** of the sight that was before

them. ~~_They sat in wonder of the sight they saw._~~


**Show Image 5A-5: Storytelling**

Other children were also curious about what

they were seeing on the island. Why were their

parents and grandparents so amazed by the

sight of the eagle eating the snake? ~~_Why do_~~

~~_you think everyone was amazed at the eagle_~~

~~_and the snake?_~~ That afternoon, they sat in

wonderment at the foot of the ancient leader,

as he retold the legend that had been passed down among the Aztec for

generations.


**Show Image 5A-6: Dying crops**

“Many, many years ago,” he began, “our people

lived in the far north. One year no rain came to

their lands. Their crops dried out and died in

the sun-baked fields. ~~_[Like the Maya, the Aztec_~~

~~_also had many traditions.]_~~ So, the Aztec leaders





turned to the older, wise leaders among them

and asked them, ‘What shall we do?’



**72**



“The wise leaders answered, ‘We must leave our home. Our stories have told

of a time when all our people would have to move on. That time has come.’


“‘We will go south,’ the Aztec leaders said to the hungry people. ~~_[The leader_~~

~~_is telling the children the story of what was said to the people before they_~~

~~_began their journey.]._~~ ‘Some of our brothers have gone there already and are

serving as soldiers for the rulers of other tribes. These brothers have sent

back word that there is a huge valley there with plenty of water. It will be a

difficult journey with many dangers, but we are Aztec! We are not afraid!’


Unit 3 Early American Civilizations : Aztecs, Maya, Incas


**Show Image 5A-7: Journeying Aztec**

“And so, a few days later, they put all that

they could carry onto their backs and set out

for the promise of green valleys with plenty

of water for drinking and growing crops. Day

after day, month after month, they traveled,

resting only at night.



“That was many years ago, but our people have never settled for long. Every

time we settled in the green valley around us, we were forced to move. Our

crops have dried out again and again, or the rain has stopped, or another

ruler has said we cannot stay on their land. We have not yet found our home.”


**Show Image 5A-8: Close-up of the sign**

“Our stories say that when the Aztec people

see an eagle on a cactus eating a serpent, ~~_or_~~

~~_snake,_~~ we would know that we had found our

true home. For nearly one hundred years now,

our people have wandered in search of the





eagle and snake atop a cactus. ~~_[So the Aztec_~~

~~_were traveling in search of a new home. They_~~



~~_waited until they saw an eagle sitting on a cactus, eating a snake, to tell them_~~

~~_where they should stop to make their home]._~~


**Show Image 5A-9: Storytelling Aztec leader**

“And so,” the old leader continued, “you can

see why this is such an important day for our

people. At last, we have found our home.”


The children smiled at one another. They

began to understand the importance of seeing

the wondrous sight of the eagle eating the

snake. “We are home,” they said to one another. “Yes,” their parents said to

them. “You are home. We are all home.”


Lesson 5 The Aztec: The Legend of the Eagle and the Serpent
**73**


**Show Image 5A-10: Tenochtitlan**

That is the **legend** of how the Aztec came to

live on and around Lake Texcoco in what is now

Mexico. ~~_A legend is a story that has been told_~~

~~_over the years that may or may not be true._~~

The legend explains why they built their city on

islands in the lake, beginning with the island

on which they had seen the eagle.

Over many years, the Aztec’s city grew in size, with many more buildings. Since

the Aztec people had finally settled, they would go on to build some of the

largest and grandest buildings of the ancient world. Their city included roads,

streets for boats (which are called canals), pyramids, and palaces. In this spot

on the lake, the Aztecs would go on to build their people’s capital, or main city,

called Tenochtitlan [/te*nok*tit*lan/] or [/tee*noch*teet*lan/]. You will learn

more about Tenochtitlan in future lessons.


Check for Understanding


**Think-Share:** In the middle of the story, you heard that everyone

was amazed at the sight of the eagle and the snake. Why was this?

_(The Aztec knew from their legends that the sight of the eagle and_

_the snake was important. It meant they should stay in that place_

_and make it their home.)_


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** Did the Aztec move around a lot or a little at the beginning of the
story? _(a lot)_

   - **Literal.** Why did the Aztec leave where they had been living and begin
traveling to try to find a new home? _(The fields dried up, and they didn’t_
_have enough food.)_


2. **Literal.** What did the Aztec see that made them decide to stay and live in
this area around Lake Texcoco? _(They saw the sight of the eagle and the_
_serpent, which was an important sight, according to their legends. It meant_
_they should stay in that place.)_

   - **Literal.** What did the leader tell the children about the Aztec’s history?
_(Answers may vary, but may include that the Aztecs had been wandering in_
_search of a home for a long time, and that their legends said they would see_
_an eagle and serpent on a cactus when they had found their home.)_


Unit 3 Early American Civilizations : Aztecs, Maya, Incas


3. **Inferential.** Was the ending of the story happy or sad? _(happy)_ Why? _(because_
_the Aztec found a place for their home and didn’t have to travel around anymore)_


4. **Inferential.** What do we know about Aztec traditions and contributions to
architecture based on today’s Read-Aloud? _(Answers may vary, but should_
_include that the Aztec had many legends that told them about the world, they_
_believed natural sights would tell them important information, they built a city_
_on islands in a lake, they built some of the largest and grandest buildings of_
_the ancient world, etc.)_


5. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ The Aztec used the story about the eagle and
the serpent to explain where they should make their new home. What makes
this story a legend? _(Answers may vary, but should reflect that a legend is_
_a story told over the years; it may or may not be true, but there is no way to_
_prove it either way; and that it was used as an explanation for why the Aztec_
_had settled where they did.)_


~~**WORD WORK: AWE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “. . . they sat in awe of the sight that was

before them.”


2. Say the word _awe_ with me.


3. Awe means wonder or surprise.


4. We were in awe of the beautiful sunset over the Grand Canyon.


5. Tell something you have been or could be in awe of. Use the word _awe_ when
you talk about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or
rephrase students’ responses: “I was in awe of _____ when . . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I am going to name some
imaginary scenes or moments. If you think you would be able in awe of that
scene or moment, say “I would be in awe of that.” If not, say “I would not be in
awe of that.” _(Answers may vary for all.)_ Ask students to explain their reasoning.

As Torn Wing maneuvered his narrow, flat-bottomed canoe among the

canals, or waterways, separating them, he recalled his uncle’s story about

how the chinampas were formed.


**Show Image 6A-2: Making the chinampas**

The Aztec had dug ditches out of the swampy

land for water to flow through, then covered

rafts made of reeds and branches with mud

**dredged** ~~_or scooped_~~ up from the bottom of the

lake. ~~_[Point to the raft in the picture.]_~~ Over the





years, layers upon layers of mud were added

until finally, with the help of roots from the



willow trees, the islands became **stationary** . ~~_The islands no longer moved_~~

~~_because roots from the trees on the raft anchored the rafts to the bottom of_~~

~~_the lake._~~ Hundreds of narrow rectangular islands, separated by a network

of the water ditches called canals, covered the swamplands. For the people

who had long sought a way to grow plants even in times when there was no

rainfall, these island gardens provided a wonderful solution.


**Show Image 6A-3: Torn Wing arriving in**
**Xochimilco**

The surrounding water kept the earth moist

all year long, irrigating and fertilizing the

fields. Maize, beans, squash, tomatoes, and

chili peppers grew in **abundance**, supplying





the large city of Tenochtitlan and beyond.

~~Abundance~~ ~~_means in great supply. So there_~~



~~_was a lot of maize, beans, squash, tomatoes, and chili peppers growing on the_~~

~~_chinampas._~~ The gardens of Xochimilco were truly an agricultural wonderland!


Torn Wing’s uncle, Wing Feather, had described Xochimilco to Torn Wing after

the young man’s father, who was Wing Feather’s brother, had died.


**Show Image 6A-4: Torn Wing and Wing Feather**

His uncle had said, “My brother was a good

man and a good farmer. Did he teach you

everything that he knew?”


“Yes, Uncle,” Torn Wing had answered. “I

worked at his side in the fields. We always had

the best crop of any near our village.”


“Good,” his uncle had said. “I want you to know that even though your

parents are gone now, you are not alone. Your aunt and I want you to come

and live with us as our son. I can use your help in my business, and since

we have no son of our own, when I grow too old to work, it will become

yours. But Nephew, I do not want to make you leave your familiar home.

If you prefer to stay in your own village, I will help you by giving you cacao

beans. ~~_Cacao beans were very valuable. The Aztec used cacao beans as a kind_~~

~~_of money._~~ But if you choose to live with us, you should know that the city of

Tenochtitlan and its nearby floating gardens are a wonderful place to be.”


Torn Wing answered, “Then I will come, Uncle.”


**Show Image 6A-5: Torn Wing arriving in**
**Xochimilco**

Torn Wing had easily followed his uncle’s

directions to Lake Xochimilco, but now that

he was at last among the watery roads of the

place, he had forgotten his uncle’s warning:





“There are so many sights to see that it is easy

to become overwhelmed and lose your way.”



Sure enough, Torn Wing was lost. He decided to retrace his route to the edge

of the floating gardens and start again.


Just then, however, he heard an old woman’s voice asking, “Are you lost?

Perhaps I can help.”


**Show Image 6A-6: Torn Wing talking to Moon**
**Wish**

Turning, he saw a short, gray-haired woman

smiling warmly at him. She was sitting in a

boat tied by a rope to the nearest chinampa.

“If you are lost,” she said energetically, “you

are not the first. When I was a girl and came

here for the first time, it took weeks before I

learned my way around.”


Torn Wing smiled back and said, “You are very kind. As a matter of fact, I am

lost. I was trying to find my uncle. His name is Wing Feather.”


Lesson 6 The Aztec: The Floating Gardens of Xochimilco
**87**


Her smile grew even wider. “I know him! He and my sons are friends. They

can take you to him.” She squinted closely at the young man. “So you are

Wing Feather’s nephew. He told us you were coming. My name is Moon Wish.”

She turned and called over her shoulder, “Star Web! Loud Song! Come here!”


**Show Image 6A-7: Moon Wish and her sons**

From around the far side of a high, thick

cluster of plants came two of the biggest

men Torn Wing had ever seen. He thought

to himself, “These two certainly do not look

anything like their tiny mother.”





The two young brothers grinned. “It is good to

meet you,” the first one said. “I am Star Web. I

am the tall brother,” he joked. “This is my little brother, Loud Song.” Actually,

Loud Song was even bigger than Star Web, but he didn’t seem to mind this

introduction. He laughed and gave his older brother a friendly pat. Then

Star Web added, “Loud Song is especially glad to become friends of Wing

Feather’s relatives.” ~~_Who would you be talking about if you were talking about_~~

~~_your relatives?_~~ ~~(Relatives are family members.)~~


**Show Image 6A-8: Loud Song showing Torn**
**Wing the way**

Then the younger brother, Loud Song, said,

“I will lead you to your uncle.” Sliding into

a canoe so smoothly that it hardly rocked

beneath him, he said, “Follow me,” and

paddling off quickly in order to keep his guide in sight. “What a wonderful

place!” he thought. “This is my new home!” All the tiredness of his journey

was forgotten in his excitement as he rode further into the heart of the

floating gardens of Xochimilco.

~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 6A-2: Making the chinampas**


1. **Literal.** How did the Aztec make their chinampas? _(The Aztec dug canals_
_out of the swampy land, and then used the mud dredged up from the bottom_
_of the lake to cover rafts made of reeds and branches. Over the years, layers_
_upon layers of mud were added until finally, with the help of roots from the_
_willow trees, the islands became stationary.)_


2. **Literal.** How did the Aztec use the chinampas? _(The Aztec used the_
_chinampas to grow food and other crops.)_


3. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ Explain why farming was important to the
Aztec. How do you know this based on the Read-Aloud? _(Answers may vary,_
_but may include that the Aztec created unique ways of farming in an area that_
_wouldn’t normally be suited to it.)_


~~**WORD WORK: STATIONARY (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Over the years, layers upon layers of mud were
added [to the chinampas] until finally, with the help of roots from the willow
trees, the islands became stationary.”


2. Say the word _stationary_ with me.


3. When something is stationary, that means it is not moving and is fixed in
place.


4. When the bus is not moving, it is stationary.


5. Tell about something that is stationary. Try to use the word _stationary_ when
you talk about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or

**Compare/Contrast:** Compare and contrast what you know about
Mayan farming with what you have just learned about Aztec
farming. How are they similar? How are they different? _(Answers_
_will vary, but may include that both relied on farming as a main_
_source of food, but the Aztecs had a specific way of creating farms:_
_chinampas.)_

leaders. How is the Aztec civilization different? Be sure to use
the Read-Aloud or unit vocabulary in your responses and speak
clearly and at an appropriate pace. ( _Unlike the Maya, the Aztec_
_civilization is an empire, or a group of people and land that is ruled_
_by a single ruler._ )

**Show Image 7A-1: Moctezuma and his**

~~_Moctezuma was the emperor of a large empire._~~

Moctezuma [mäk-t ə -’zü-m ə ] or the Second,

**emperor** of the Aztec people, commander of

the fierce Aztec army, was moving through his





immense **palace** in the city of Tenochtitlan, the

capital of the Aztec **empire** . ~~_What are palaces?_~~



~~(grand homes for kings, queens, and emperors)~~ Before him walked one of

the four most important Aztec nobles who served the emperor. Dressed

in brightly colored, cotton clothing, the nobleman’s head was encircled by

magnificent tropical bird feathers that stuck out of a headdress made of

gold.


This fancily dressed nobleman led the way through the halls of the palace
toward the throne room, passing one of the enormous dining halls and
turning down a corridor running between two large libraries. Far behind in
the gigantic palace lay hundreds of bedrooms, including the great emperor’s,
where the bedsheets would be slept upon just once and then thrown away.


Behind him, the nobleman heard the steady slapping of Moctezuma’s golden
sandals upon the floor, and the swishing of leaves as nobles fanned his body
to keep him cool as he walked.

Do you throw away your
sheets after sleeping on
them once? What does
this tell you about the
emperor? _(Answers will_
_vary, but should include_
_that the emperor had great_
_riches, an extravagant_
_lifestyle, etc.)_



Lesson 7 The Aztec: In the Palace of the Emperor
**101**


**Show Image 7A-2: Throne room**

They entered the throne room. Like the kings

and queens in Europe, Moctezuma had a large

room with his special seat, called a throne. The

people of the empire came to the throne room

to hear Moctezuma speak. It was more than half

full already with men and women looking down

silently, for they knew that Moctezuma was



approaching and no one was allowed to look at his face. Those who were wearing

shoes had already slipped out of them, for they knew they must take them off in

Emperor Moctezuma’s presence.


Check for Understanding


**Think of a Word:** Quietly to yourself, think of what an emperor is.

[Pause.] Think of one word that describes Emperor Moctezuma.

[Ask several students to share.] _(Answers may vary, but may_
_include wealth, power, empire, palace, etc.)_


**Show Image 7A-3: Moctezuma sitting on a**
**jeweled throne**

The feathered nobleman stopped as he

approached the throne, standing aside and

turning his eyes downward as Moctezuma

walked forward and sat down upon his jeweled





throne. Moctezuma was a man whose **wealth**

could not even be measured. ~~_This means_~~



**102**



~~_that Moctezuma was so rich that it was impossible to figure out exactly how_~~

~~_rich he was._~~ In his palace were entire rooms filled with gold and silver, and

everything from fabulous, hand-carved jewelry to masks.


Now another of the Emperor’s noblemen spoke. “O, Speaker,” he began. Speaker

was the Emperor’s most important title. ~~_Like many kings and rulers around the_~~

~~_world, the Aztec believed that the emperor was the keeper, or leader, of their_~~

~~_traditions._~~ The people listened to the emperor and did what he said.


“Today there are lords here from the eastern part of your empire. ~~_Lords are owners_~~

~~_of land or other property in the empire._~~ They come to pay their respects to you, but


Unit 3 Early American Civilizations : Aztecs, Maya, Incas


also to bring more details of the strangers who come from the east.” ~~_In large_~~

~~_empires, emperors or other rulers like kings, need help ruling the land. Lords follow_~~

~~_the ruler’s laws and make sure the people on their land do too._~~


**Show Image 7A-4: Report of strangers**

The nobleman brought the lords forward.

Moctezuma said, “We have reports of strangers

riding upon huge deer. What have you seen with

your own eyes, and what have you heard?”





Now the oldest of the visiting lords, forcing

himself not to look upward upon Moctezuma’s

face, told the emperor, “I too have seen these men. But now their leader

has done something we do not understand. He has ordered his people to

burn the wooden ships at sea. They are now camped on the shore with their

deer.” ~~_Can you guess what the huge deer were that the strangers were riding?_~~

~~_The Aztecs had never seen horses._~~


Moctezuma was giving his full attention to the man’s words. Then he turned to the

Snake Woman who stood beside his throne. The Snake Woman was the title given

to the second most important person in the government.


**Show Image 7A-5: Moctezuma and Snake**
**Woman**

The title of Snake Woman was given in honor of

one of the most important characters from the

Aztec traditions and stories. The Snake Woman

helped Moctezuma run the nation.





“Does the burning of the wooden ships mean

that they intend to never leave our lands?” Moctezuma asked the Snake Woman.


The Snake Woman replied, “I do not know, O, Emperor Moctezuma, but it

seems to show that the strangers feel safe enough here to cut off their own

form of **retreat** .” ~~_To retreat from something means to move away from it or_~~

~~_leave. Since the visitors are burning their ships, they must be planning to stay,_~~

~~_and not retreat, or leave._~~


The Snake Woman nodded to the nobleman, who continued, “There is other

news. These strangers have made friends with the Totonacs [t ō t ə ’näk], the

people of Cempoala [/sem*poe*al* ə /]. And together with them, they are

starting in this direction.”


Lesson 7 The Aztec: In the Palace of the Emperor
**103**


At this, a worried murmur ran through all those in the throne room, for the

Totonacs, the people of Cempoala, were enemies of the Aztec. ~~_Why would_~~

~~_the strangers make friends with the Aztec’s enemies? Were they planning to_~~

~~_attack the Aztec?_~~


**Show Image 7A-6: Moctezuma’s feast**

The lords continued their report, followed by

reports on other matters by other servants

of Moctezuma. Afterward, the nobleman with

the magnificent feathers once again led the

emperor through the halls, this time to his





main dining hall. ~~_A dining hall is a place where_~~

~~_people eat meals. [You may want to reference_~~

Remind students that
making predictions is
more than just trying to
guess what happens next.
When making a prediction,
the reader should think
carefully about what they

~~_the school cafeteria.]_~~ There, Moctezuma and hundreds of his nobles sat

down to a feast, eating off beautiful plates that were given away after just

one use.


**Show Image 7A-7: Emperor Moctezuma**
**meeting with his counselors**

Later, Emperor Moctezuma and his chief

advisors met together and Moctezuma said,

“Send gold and silver to the leaders of these

strangers. Let the nobles who bring these gifts





tell the strangers that they are on Aztec land,

ruled by Emperor Moctezuma, who sends



these small tokens of his power and wealth. ~~_The emperor wants to show off_~~

~~_his riches, or his wealth, to assert, or prove, his power._~~ They will know from

these gifts the great wealth and power we wield here, and perhaps they will

turn and leave our empire.” ~~_Who do you think these strangers are? [Record_~~

~~_students’ predictions for review and discussion in Lesson 8.]_~~


Unit 3 Early American Civilizations : Aztecs, Maya, Incas


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** Who was the emperor of the Aztec in the story? _(Moctezuma)_


2. **Inferential.** Why does Moctezuma want to send the strangers gifts? ( _to_
_show his power and wealth in hopes that they will leave_ )


3. **Evaluative.** Do you think the strangers will leave once they receive the gifts
from Moctezuma? Why or why not? _(Answers may vary.)_


4. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ Compare and contrast Moctezuma with the
Mayan king, King Pakal. _(Answers may vary, but may include that both were_
_rich and privileged, and that King Pakal was a king while Moctezuma was an_
_emperor.)_


~~**WORD WORK: EMPEROR (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Moctezuma the Second, emperor of the Aztec
people . . .”


2. Say the word _emperor_ with me.


3. An emperor is a ruler of an empire. A female emperor is called an empress.


4. The emperor ruled his empire very strictly.


5. Moctezuma was the emperor of the Aztec, so people were not allowed to
look at him, and every time he ate, he used new plates. What would it be like
if you were an emperor or empress? Try to use the word _emperor_ or _empress_
when you talk about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or
rephrase students’ responses: “If I were an emperor (empress), I would . . . ”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Sharing activity for follow-up.** Pretend you are an emperor/empress.
Tell a partner what your life would be like. What would you call your empire?
How would you let people know you are the emperor/empress? Be sure to
use the word(s) _emperor_ (or _empress_ ) and, if you can, _empire_ when you tell
about it.

 - Tell students that you are about to read part of an actual letter from Cortés,
the leader of the Spaniards who sailed to Mexico, to the king of Spain. In
the letter, Cortés describes Emperor Moctezuma and the capital city of
Tenochtitlan. Tell students to listen carefully to the Read-Aloud to find out

The Aztec state is in the shape of a circle. It is completely surrounded by tall

mountains. There are two lakes that take up almost the entire valley in which the

city is located. One of the lakes is freshwater, and the other is a saltwater lake.


**Show Image 8A-2: Aerial view of Tenochtitlan**

The great city of Tenochtitlan is made up of

two islands that sit in the middle of the salt

lake, Lake Texcoco. There are four entrances

to this **enormous** city. ~~_This picture shows just_~~

~~_how enormous, or very large, Tenochtitlan was._~~



“Your majesty” is a polite
way to address the king,

large bridges were constructed. The bridges are so wide that as many as

ten horses walking side by side could cross them. The main streets are very

wide and straight. Some of the smaller streets are made of land and some

are made of water, similar to streams or canals. The people of the city use

canoes to travel in the streets made of water. ~~_[Have students point to the_~~

~~_bridges, canals, and roads Cortés mentions in the Flip Book image.]_~~


**Show Image 8A-3: Busy Tenochtitlan market**

There are several main squares, all of which

contain markets. ~~_Squares are open areas in a_~~

feathers, medicines, wood, coal, sleeping mats, clothing, and pottery. ~~_This_~~

~~_advanced—even more than some European cities of the time._~~ Along with all the

items that are for sale, there are also restaurants and barber shops. A building,

like a courthouse, also sits in the market. ~~_A courthouse is a building where_~~

~~_lawyers and judges try cases to uphold the law or rules._~~ People in this building

are like judges, resolving arguments and ordering punishment for criminals.

Also in Tenochtitlan, there are many beautiful

these buildings. They dress in black and wear

the exact same clothing for their whole lives,

and they never cut or comb their hair.

**Show Image 8A-5: Getting water from an**
**aqueduct**

Since the lake surrounding the city is a

saltwater lake, there are aqueducts that carry

the water from the freshwater lake into the

city. ~~_Aqueducts are special structures like pipes_~~
~~_or bridges that carry water from one place to_~~
~~_another. [Point to the aqueduct in the picture.]_~~

The aqueducts carry the water over the bridge.



Once over the bridge, the water is distributed throughout the city to be used

for drinking and for other purposes. The water from the aqueducts makes up

the whole city’s water supply! It is quite amazing to see.


Check for Understanding


**Think-Share:** Do you think Cortés is impressed by the Aztec city?
How can you tell?


Order has been established and is well-kept in the city. The people of the

city are very friendly and **courteous** to one another, and behave much in

the same way as Spaniards. I found this most surprising because of how

different they and their city look from ours. ~~_The people are nice and helpful_~~

~~_to each other, making the city a peaceful place to be where everything_~~

~~_works well._~~


**Show Image 8A-6: Moctezuma**

In regard to Emperor Moctezuma, his empire

is quite unbelievable. I have been unable to

find out how large of an area he rules. I believe

he rules a land at least as large as Spain. ~~_This_~~

~~_means that Cortés thinks that Moctezuma’s_~~





~~_empire is very big. It was as big as the state of_~~

~~_Utah! [Point to Utah on a U.S. map.]_~~



However, I have seen with my own eyes his great wealth. He possesses many,

many objects made from gold, silver, and other precious metals, all made

by wonderful craftsmen. Within the city, there are quite a few palaces—so

wondrous that I could not possibly describe them adequately.


Lesson 8 The Aztec: Cortés’s Letter
**117**


**Show Image 8A-7: Inside the princes’ palace**

One of the smaller palaces is attached to a

beautiful garden with a balcony that runs over

top of it. ~~_[Point to the balcony in the picture.]_~~

Two high-ranking princes live inside this

palace. Also, inside the palace are ten pools of

water; some of the pools are of saltwater and

some are of freshwater. In each of the pools



live different kinds of birds. The birds that need saltwater live in the saltwater

pools, and the birds that need freshwater live in the freshwater pools. Each

type of bird is given the type of food that it likes best—whether it is worms,

maize, seeds, or fish. The **royalty** here ~~_or people of royal blood, like kings,_~~

~~_queens, princes, and princesses_~~ are able to just look out a window and be

amused by the birds in the various pools.


**Show Image 8A-8: Aztec city of Tenochtitlan**

I have tried to write these descriptions as

truthfully as I can, so that your Majesty may have

an accurate picture of this part of the world.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Introducing the Read-Aloud**

 - Display a world map to point out the location of the ancient Mayan and
Aztec civilizations, as well as the location of the Inca in South America.
Alternatively, you may access a digital version of a map showing these
locations in the online materials for this unit.


 - Prepare and display a timeline, and be prepared to add Image Card 13 on the
range of 1300 AD–1533 AD. Alternatively, you may access a digital version of
a timeline in the online materials for this unit.


**Application**

 - Prepare and display a Civilization Chart like the one below for the Inca on a
wall or board in your classroom. Each section will need to be large enough
for an Image Card. You will add information to this at the end of each lesson.
Leave the chart displayed for student reference throughout the unit.


 - You may wish to place students in four groups of roughly equal numbers:
farming, cities, leaders, and traditions. It is recommended that you place
students who need an extra challenge in the “cities” category, as they will
have the least amount of time. Students will work together in Lesson 10 to
craft an informational paragraph on their topic.


**Universal Access**

 - Bring in items that can be owned, such as pencils, pens, jackets, shoes,
photographs, and images of items that cannot be owned, such as the sun,
clouds, rain, the moon, etc.

~~**“THE INCA: WHO WERE THE INCA?” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 9A-2: Map of the Inca Empire**

The Inca were one of many groups of people

who lived in North, Central, or South America

long ago. They lived in the western part of

South America, which you can see on the

map. The Inca lived in parts of what we now





call Bolivia, Ecuador, Argentina, Peru, and

Chile. ~~_[Point to the illustration.]_~~

They controlled about 2,500 miles of land in South America. That’s about the

same distance as if you measured from one side of the United States to the

other.

**Show Image 9A-3: Inca roads**

More incredibly, the Inca created almost

20,000 miles of roads. They walked or ran

in order to share ideas and information with

other Inca in faraway parts of their empire.

Many of these roads are still used today. ~~_In this_~~

~~_image, people are walking on Inca roads that_~~

~~_were built long ago._~~



The Inca controlled so much land because they conquered other nations of

people. Each time they did, the size of their empire would grow. ~~_Remember,_~~

~~_to conquer is to take over other people, against their will, and control their_~~

~~_land. What is another civilization that we read about that conquered other_~~

~~_people and had an empire?_~~ ~~(the Aztec)~~ ~~_Just as the Aztec conquered other_~~

~~_people and had an empire, the Inca did as well, but in a different area._~~ When

the Inca conquered other nations, the emperor of the Inca would often have

the conquered **villagers** move to a new area. ~~_A village is like a small town. Can_~~

~~_anyone tell me what a villager is?_~~ ~~(Villagers are the people who live in a small~~

was forced to move.

“I do not understand,” cried the girl. Her name

was Little Flower, and she was five years old.

“Why do we have to move? This is where we

live.” ~~_The girl’s name is Little Flower. The Inca,_~~

~~_like the Maya and the Aztec, were named for_~~





~~_plants, animals, or types of weather that had_~~

~~_special meaning to them._~~



Her older sister, Blue Sky, tried to explain, as she had been trying for three

days now. “The emperor of the Inca has ordered our people, the people of the

Village of Stone Walls, to move.”

“He says we must go and live up in the big,

( / kooz*ko/). He says we will get to be friends

with the Inca people. And before you ask me

again, Little Flower, I will tell you one last time.

The emperor of the Inca now rules the Village

of Stone Walls. We have to do as he says or he

will be very angry.”


**Show Image 9A-6: Little Flower and Blue Sky**

Blue Sky thought about how much to tell Little

Flower. She did not want to upset her sister,

but even though she was usually a very, very

patient older sister, she was so tired of talking

about this over and over again. “After all,” she

thought, “I am not so old myself. I do not like

to think about these things either.” But then



she looked once more at her little sister, whom she really did love, and said

as gently as she could, “If the Inca emperor gets angry with all the people

of the Village of Stone Walls, it will not be like when papa or mama gets mad

at you or me. It will be much worse. So I think we had better do what he

orders, ~~_or says,_~~ don’t you?”


Little Flower thought about this. “Yes,” she answered, “I guess we had better

do it.” But as Blue Sky smiled and went back to **collecting** ~~_or gathering_~~ their

things, the smaller girl whispered to herself, “But I still don’t like it.” ~~_How do_~~

~~_you think Little Flower and Blue Sky feel about leaving their village?_~~

**Village of Stone Walls**

Three days later, all the people who had lived

in the Village of Stone Walls were almost ready

to move. They were sad to leave their home,

and even the oldest and wisest of them felt the





way that Little Flower felt, for they were about

to go somewhere no one from the Village of



Stone Walls had ever even visited. The people from the Village of Stone Walls

were used to living in the dry, flat desert lands down near the ocean coast

of what is today called Peru. They had never been a mountain people, nor

they were able to take with them onto their llama. Early the next morning,

Blue Sky, Little Flower, and the rest of the people from the Village of Stone

Walls left their homes to make new ones in the mountains around Cuzco.


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** In the story, how are llamas used to help the people of the Village of
Stone Walls? _(The llamas were used to carry loads of possessions for them as_
_they traveled to Cuzco.)_


Check for Understanding


**Think-Share:** The Read-Aloud says that the Inca created 20,000
miles of roads. Why did they need so many roads? _(The Inca had a_
_very large empire, and as the empire grew, they built more and more_
_roads to connect their newly conquered lands.)_


2. **Literal.** Why were all the people in the Village of Stone Walls moving at once?
_(They were forced to move by the emperor of the Inca, who had conquered the_
_village. They had no choice.)_


3. **Inferential.** What is the most important part of this story? _(when Blue Sky_
_told Little Flower that the emperor would be angry if they did not do as he_
_said)_ How do you know? _(The talk helped Little Flower understand why they_
_had to move.)_

possessions you have
collected and the images

To possess means you
have something in your
possession. Have you
ever wanted to possess
something that you
couldn’t have? Tell a
partner about such a time.


**136**



4. **Inferential.** What can you tell about the leaders of the Inca? _(Answers_
_may vary, but may include that the Inca wanted to expand their empire; they_
_appear bossy, making people move to other areas, away from their homes;_
_they were feared.)_


5. **Literal.** How was the Village of Stone Walls different from the city of Cuzco
where Blue Sky, Little Flower, and the others are moving? _(The Village of_
_Stone Walls was located in flat, dry desert lands near the ocean coast. Cuzco_
_was located high up in the mountains where it was much colder.)_


~~**WORD WORK: POSSESSIONS (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Blue Sky and Little Flower loaded all the
possessions they were able to take with them onto their llama.”


2. Say the word _possessions_ with me.


3. The word _possessions_ means things that you possess, or own.


4. Some of my favorite possessions are family photographs and
my old, soft baby blanket.


5. What are your favorite possessions? If you had to move quickly and could
only take one or two things with you, what would you choose to take? Tell
us what they are, using the word _possessions_ . [Ask two or three students.
If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses: “My favorite

Remind students that a legend is a story that is passed down between

 - Tell students they will learn more about the Inca.


**The Legend of Viracocha**

It is told that Viracocha rose up from the Island of the Sun in the middle of

Lake Titicaca [/ti*tee*ko*ko/], near Peru’s capital city of Cuzco, the city that

was close to Blue Sky and Little Flower’s new mountain home. Viracocha

built the earth and the sky from nothing. He formed the moon and sun. Then

he created all the beings of the earth, the animals and plants, and people.


Some say that Viracocha made the people out of mud; others say that he

used the native stone that is so plentiful in the Andes Mountains of Peru. He

divided the figures into groups, giving each group its own language, its own

foods to grow, and its own legends to tell.


Once Viracocha finished his job on Earth, it is said that he wandered off into

the sunset, walking across the waters of the Pacific Ocean.


**Show Image 9B-2: Terrace farming**

Like the Maya and Aztec, the Inca were powerful rulers. Like the legend says,

the empire was full of different groups of people with different languages and

traditions. Families like Blue Sky and Little Flower’s, who were conquered by

the Inca, could keep their language. To show respect for their new emperor,

they would help build roads, serve in their army, and grow food for the empire.


The Inca were hard workers. Most were farmers. A mountain is too steep

to grow crops, so the Inca cut **terraces** into the mountain to plant crops. ~~_A_~~

~~_terrace is a flat area of land cut into a mountain._~~ They grew potatoes, beans,

avocados, and maize.


Many Inca took care of llamas and alpacas. The Inca would shear, or cut, the

fur off of the animals to make fleece. The fleece was used to make clothing,

bags, string, and other useful items. Taking care of crops and animals was a

difficult job in the mountains where the Inca lived.


**Show Image 9B-3: Quipu**

The Aztec and Maya kept track of their stories and calendar with

inscriptions, or writing carved into wood and stone. The Inca did not have a

written language like the Maya and Aztec. Instead, the Inca kept track of their

~~_A conqueror is someone who fights to take_~~

Peru is high in the Andes Mountains, which include some of the world’s

tallest, most challenging peaks. ~~_Challenging is another way of saying really_~~

~~_hard. The Andes Mountains were really hard to climb._~~ Bingham decided he

would begin his exploration for information in the ancient city of Cuzco. His

only other clue about Vitcos was that the city was said to have been built

where a huge white rock overlooked a pool in a river. Of course, Bingham

didn’t know if all of these so-called clues and legends were true; there might

never have been such a city. Bingham went looking for Vitcos anyway.


**Show Image 10A-4: Bingham meets Arteaga**

In Cuzco, Bingham started out with a small

group of companions riding mules along roads

that soon turned into trails. One night the

small travel party camped near a river. A bit

later, a stranger appeared unexpectedly. He





was a local police sergeant whose tiny house

was nearby. “My name is Arteaga




[/ar*tae* ə g* ə /],” he said holding out his hand, and Bingham shook it,

replying, “I’m Hiram Bingham.” When Arteaga heard of Bingham’s interest in

old ruins, he said, “Señor, I have heard of some **ruins** . If you like, I will take

you there. However, it will be quite a climb.”


Bingham answered, “If you can take me, I can get there.”


They set out the next morning while the rest of Bingham’s companions

waited behind, not willing to climb dangerous slopes because they were

worried that the rumor of ruins was not true.

**Show Image 10A-5: Arteaga and Bingham**
**standing above the Urubamba**

After walking for nearly an hour, Arteaga led

Bingham down to a cliff’s edge. Below lay

a silver-gray river **raging** into whitewater

rapids. ~~_The water in the river was flowing_~~

~~_very fast and looked dangerous._~~ Bingham

could hear it roar as it raced along below.



“Urubamba River,” said Arteaga casually. “We’re going there.” He pointed to

a shaky-looking rope suspension bridge with wooden slats that looked as if

it would collapse under the weight of a bird. ~~_So does the bridge sound sturdy_~~

~~_and safe?_~~ Bingham took a deep breath and started out onto the bridge. He

picked his way across carefully, testing each board before he put his weight

on it and praying the ropes would hold. The bridge swung and swayed wildly

with every step he took. He told himself, “Don’t look down. It will only frighten

you more.” Finally he was across, and then Arteaga followed.


**Show Image 10A-6: Arteaga and Bingham**
**talking to a group of native Incas**

For hours, they walked on through dense

forest. They came to an open spot where some

Incas lived in huts and grew food on narrow,

level strips of land called terraces. ~~_[Point to the_~~





~~_terraces in the picture.]_~~ These terraces, carved

into the mountainside by their Inca ancestors,



had been used this way for centuries. Arteaga and Bingham shared lunch

with these people in a hut. It was clearly an important occasion for their

hosts, who seldom saw visitors.


After lunch, Arteaga and Bingham climbed an additional 1,000 feet and

emerged from the trees onto a level place. ~~_They came out on a flat place._~~

Although vines and bushes covered much of it, he could see stone walls had

been built to make more terraces. Looking beyond, he saw a remarkable

sight. “Look, Arteaga!” he shouted. Spread out across the mountain top lay

an enormous set of stone buildings, their wooden roofs long since gone, but

their carefully fitted stone walls still standing.

**Show Image 10A-7: Bingham seeing**
**Machu Picchu**

This dramatic setting—two thousand feet

above the raging river and with another, higher

mountain peak thrusting up behind them—

took Bingham’s breath away for a moment.

Arteaga asked, “Señor, is this your lost city of

Vitcos?”



“I do not know,” Bingham replied, “but whatever it is, it is amazing.”


Indeed, it later became clear that this was not the city of Vitcos. But this

discovery, a city that seemed to float among the clouds, was even more

fantastic. With no record of its **existence**, ~~_meaning no one wrote down what_~~

~~_its name was, who lived there, etc.,_~~ Bingham named his discovery after the

towering mountain: Machu Picchu [/mo*choo/] [/pee*choo/], which means

“Old Mountain” in the Inca language.


The Inca living nearby in the mountains did not know who had built the

deserted city, nor did they know what had happened to the people who had

built it.


Later, Bingham wrote that Machu Picchu might have been the last hiding

place of Inca royalty, built so high that no Spaniard had even guessed

it existed; or perhaps the city had been some special center for Incan

traditions. He never learned the answer.


**Show Image 10A-8: Bingham seeing Vitcos**

A few weeks after reaching Machu Picchu,

Hiram Bingham stood above a watery pool

next to a huge white rock that was carved with

Inca designs. Hiram Bingham had found the

ruins of Vitcos, the place he had been seeking.





But it was the discovery of Machu Picchu and

its dramatic setting that would bring Hiram

Bingham worldwide fame.

Consider also extending
this activity by adding
group or independent
writing opportunities
associated with the “You
Were There” concept. For
example, ask students
to pretend they are
newspaper reporters in
Moctezuma’s throne room
and write a group news
article describing it.

**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**

 - Give students a key vocabulary word such as _harvest_ or _pyramid_ . Have them
brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear the word. Record
their responses on board/chart paper for reference.


**You Were There: Aztec City**

 - Have students pretend that they were part of an ancient Aztec city.


 - Ask students to describe what they would have seen and heard. For example,
students could pretend they were in Moctezuma’s throne room. What did
they see? What did they hear?


**Make Your Own Civilization Chart**

 - Divide the class into four groups. Give each group one of the Image Cards
from the Civilization Chart: Inca to discuss within the group.


 - Ask each group to come up with three things to tell about each Image Card
and the category it represents with respect to the Inca.


 - Then, have the groups come back together and share with the class.
Remember to repeat and expand upon each response using richer and more
complex language, including, if possible, any Read-Aloud vocabulary.


 - Explain that the Inca culture is considered a civilization because the people
living there farmed, built cities, had leaders, and practiced traditions. Groups
of people around the world, in ancient times and modern times, have done all
of these things. There have been, and still are, many civilizations.


 - Have students create their own Civilization Chart using Activity Page UR.1
to share with their families. Make the class Civilization Chart available for
reference, but let students know that they may think of other things to draw
in addition to the pictures on the Image Cards. Have students draw pictures
to show what they have learned about the various components of the Inca
civilization.


Unit 3 Early American Civilizations : Aztecs, Maya, Incas

 - Remind students that in the Read-Aloud from Lesson 10 they heard, “The
Spanish conquerors destroyed a lot of the Inca culture while they were
attacking the Inca Empire”


 - Have students say the word _culture_ with you.


 - Tell students that _culture_ means the characteristic features of everyday life
shared by people in a certain place or time (such as the Inca).


 - Ask students to tell something interesting that they have learned
about the culture of early American civilizations (Inca, Aztec, or Maya).
The culture could refer to the beliefs, social practices, and other
characteristics of the civilization. Encourage students to use the word
_culture_ when they tell about it.


 - Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’
responses: “Calendars were an important part of the Mayan culture.”


 - Have students think about what makes a culture unique, or special. Have
them share with their neighbor, explaining their opinions and using the word
_culture_ in complete sentences.

**Directions:** I am going to read sentences about ancient civilizations. If
the sentence is only true for the Maya, circle the letter ‘M’ in that row. If
the sentence is only true for the Aztec, circle the letter ‘A’ in that row. If
the sentence is only true for the Inca, circle the letter ‘I’ in that row. If the
sentence is true for all of the civilizations, circle all of the letters.


**Note:** It may be helpful for some students to have a bookmark to put under
the row being used each time.

###### Culminating Activities


~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


Please use these final two days to address class results of the Unit
Assessment. Based on the results of the Unit Assessment and students’
formative assessments, you may wish to use this class time to provide
remediation opportunities that target specific areas of weakness for
individual students, small groups, or the whole class.


Alternatively, you may also choose to use this class time to extend or enrich
students’ experience with unit knowledge. A number of enrichment activities
are provided in this section in order to provide students with opportunities to
enliven their experiences with unit concepts.


~~**REMEDIATION**~~


Remediation opportunities include:


  - targeting review activities


  - revisiting lesson Applications


  - rereading and discussing select Read-Alouds


~~**ENRICHMENT**~~


**Note** : Be sure to always follow your school’s policy regarding food
distribution and allergies.


**Museum Exhibit**


**Materials:** Image Cards


  - In the groups they wrote their informational paragraphs with, have students
choose images from their own drawings and Image Cards that relate to their
topic.


  - Have students arrange these images in a designated space in the classroom
to form an “exhibit.”


  - Have the class visit each “exhibit” while the given topic’s group reads their
prewritten paragraph on the topic.



Image Cards


Support


Show images of a
(history) museum exhibit
to support students in
curating their own.



Culminating Activities
**161**


Activity Page CA.1


Support


If necessary, reread
the titles of recent
Read-Alouds to refresh
students’ memories. You
may also want to choose
one yourself.


**162**




 - At each exhibit, ask students if they have any questions about the content.


 - After all groups have presented, you may wish for students to write a
response statement about their experience.


**Comparing Civilizations**


**Materials:** Civilization Chart: Maya, Civilization Chart: Aztec, Civilization
Chart: Inca, Venn diagram (optional)


 - Lead students in a discussion of what they have learned in each of the three
museum days they have participated in.


   - Ask students to recall information from each aspect of the civilizations.


   - Ask students to compare and contrast aspects of one civilization with
another.


   - Looking at all aspects of civilizations, ask students how they were similar
and different.


 - You may wish to have the class or individual students fill in a Venn diagram
comparing and contrasting the three societies.


**Word Sort**


**Materials:** Activity Page CA.1


 - Have students cut out the words and place them under one of the correct
categories: Aztec, Maya, or Inca.


**Student Choice**

 - Have students select a Read-Aloud to be heard again.


 - Reread the text that is selected. Feel free to pause at different places in the
Read-Aloud this time and talk about vocabulary and information that you did
not discuss previously during the Read-Aloud.


 - After the Read-Aloud, ask students if they noticed anything new or different
during the second reading that they did not notice during the first reading.
Remember to repeat and expand upon each response using richer and more
complex language, including, if possible, any Read-Aloud vocabulary.


**Caption the Image**

 - Display a Flip Book image from any Read-Aloud.


 - Have students write a caption for the image describing what is happening
and/or a key idea from the Read-Aloud.


**Ancient Ruins**

 - To learn more about the ancient ruins, use approved local resources to find
pictures and descriptions of Aztec, Inca, or Maya.


Unit 3 Early American Civilizations : Aztecs, Maya, Incas


**Inca Music**

  - Music was an important part of Inca culture. Select an audio CD or download
Mp3 (or listen to samples) of music listed in the online materials for this unit.


**Inca Weaving Project**

  - Make mini looms from 3” x 5” piece of cardboard; make cuts along two
opposite edges (about 1/4- to 1/2-inch apart). For each loom, tape one end of
the yarn to the back of the cardboard, then fitting the yarn into the notches,
wrap the yarn around the cardboard. Tape the other end of the yarn to the
back of the cardboard.


  - Take another length of yarn and tape one end to the back of the cardboard
loom. Wrap a piece of tape around the end of the yarn. Have students thread
the yarn in an over-under pattern, back and forth across the loom. When the
weaving is done, turn over the cardboard, and take off the pieces of tape that
are holding down the ends of the yarn. Peel off the loops of yarn over the tabs
along one side of the weaving. Slide the other side of the weaving off over
the other tabs. Tie a knot around each of the four loose ends, then cut off the
extra threads of yarn.
