Dear Family Member,

During the next several days, your student will be learning about the human body.
Your student will learn about five important body systems: skeletal, muscular, digestive,
circulatory, and nervous. Below are some suggestions of activities to do at home to
reinforce what your student is learning about how our bodies work to keep us alive.

Ask your student to describe a body organ that they learn about each day. Have your
student tell you why the organ is important and the name of the body system to which
it belongs.


2. Systems at Work

Ask your student which body systems are at work as you walk, talk, eat, and read
together. Encourage the use of vocabulary being learned at school by asking your student
to explain how the systems are working together.


3. Draw and Write

Have your student draw and/or write about what has been learned about each of the
body systems and then share the drawing and/or writing with you. Ask questions to keep
your student using the vocabulary learned at school.


4. Words to Use

Below are several of the words that your student will be learning about and using. Try to
use these words as they come up in everyday speech with your student.

_• systems—_ Human body systems include the digestive system and the
circulatory system.

_• support_ —The beams of the house support the roof.

_• voluntary_ —His participation in the race was voluntary.

_• digestion_ —The digestion of food takes the body several days to complete.

_• heart_ —The heart is an involuntary muscle.

_• nerves_ —The tips of your fingers are full of nerves that allow you to feel.


5. Read Aloud Each Day
