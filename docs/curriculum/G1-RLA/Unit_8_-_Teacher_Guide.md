###### Introduction


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching the
_American Independence_ unit. The Teacher Guide for _American Independence_ contains twelve daily
lessons, each of which is composed of two distinct parts, so that the lesson may be divided into
smaller chunks of time and presented at different intervals during the day. The entire lesson will
require a total of sixty minutes.


This unit also includes a Pausing Point after Lesson 6, which contains a Mid-Unit Assessment. At the
end of the unit, a Unit Review, a Unit Assessment, and Culminating Activities are included to allow
time to review, reinforce, assess, and remediate content knowledge. You should spend no more than
nineteen days total on this unit.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


At the back of this Teacher Guide, you will find a section titled “Teacher Resources.” In this section
you will find the following:

~~**UNIT COMPONENTS**~~


Along with this Teacher Guide, you will need:


 - Flip Book for _American Independence_


 - Image Cards for _American Independence_


 - Activity Book for _American Independence_


 - Digital Components for _American Independence_


All unit components’ materials can also be found in the digital version provided with the program’s online
materials.


~~**WHY AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE IS IMPORTANT**~~


In this unit, students will hear about when and how our country, the United States of America,
started. They will be introduced to many important historical figures and events as the story unfolds
of how the thirteen colonies determined and gained their independence from Britain to become the
United States of America.


The overriding focus of this unit is from the perspective of a rather wide lens (i.e., to emphasize the
story of how the colonies became an independent nation). Although students will hear about many
people, events, and dates, it is important to recognize that Grade 1 students are not expected to
master or recall all of these details and facts. Some specifics, such as locating the thirteen original
colonies and explaining the significance of the Declaration of Independence, are necessary so that
students can understand and retell the story of our nation’s birth. All details that Grade 1 students
should be able to recall are explicitly identified in the Core Content Objectives contained in this
introduction.


In the Read-Alouds at the beginning of the unit, students will hear about the establishment
of the thirteen colonies and will learn about the conflicts that ensued between the colonies
and Great Britain. They will learn about how a desire for religious freedom and democratic
representation influenced America’s founders. They will learn how the British imposing taxes upon
the colonies led to the Boston Tea Party and, eventually, to war between the colonies and Britain,
culminating in the Declaration of Independence and the founding of a new nation. Additional ReadAlouds highlight several particularly important historical figures—Betsy Ross, George Washington,
Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson. The unit concludes with a Read-Aloud that focuses on
important symbols of our nation and what inspired them. Understanding the chronology of events
and the importance of certain people—and how they fit together during this formative period of
American history—will lay the foundation for other historical topics in this and later grades.


Unit 8 American Independence


The text that students will be listening to and discussing provides opportunities for students to build
content knowledge and draw connections to social studies. You may build on class discussions to
support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of Government, Citizenship,
Geography, and History from the Social Studies TEKS. This content is not a replacement for
the grade-level social studies instruction. For more information on religious source material in
reading/language arts, consult the program guide. For more information about the quantitative
and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text
Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED DURING KINDERGARTEN**~~


The following units, and the specific core content that was targeted in those units, are particularly
relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _American Independence_ .


  - **Colonial and Native Americans**


  - **America: Our Great Country**


Introduction

~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _American Independence_ in the forms
in which they appear in the Read-Alouds. Bold-faced words in the list have an associated Word
Work activity. The inclusion of the words on this list does not mean that students are immediately
expected to be able to use all of these words on their own. However, through repeated exposure
throughout the lessons, they should understand most of these words and begin to use them in
conversation.

~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit, students will explore the genre of informational writing. They will learn to identify
important facts and information before, during, and after informational Read-Alouds. They will
practice collecting and synthesizing information by note-taking as a group with graphic organizers
and by retelling the Read-Alouds from the first eight lessons in an ongoing Story Chart. Students
will also work as a class, in small groups, and independently to write captions for an ongoing picture
gallery, analyzing and describing images depicting important events in this time period. In Lesson
12, you will review informational paragraph writing. Students will then plan and write their own
informational paragraphs about the founding of the United States. You may wish to add the following
to students’ writing portfolios:


  - Thirteen Colonies Map (Lesson 1)


  - captions for the picture gallery (Lessons 2, 5, 7, 10, 11)


  - Somebody Wanted But So Then (Lessons 3 and 4)


  - the Original Flag (Lesson 6)


  - informational paragraphs (Lesson 12)


  - any additional writing completed during the Pausing Point, Unit Review, or Culminating Activities


~~**FOUNDATIONAL ORAL LANGUAGE**~~


The Think-Pair-Share and Turn and Talk prompts throughout the unit provide opportunities to teach
and reinforce how to communicate by using conventions of language, speaking when recognized,
and making appropriate contributions to discussions.


  - You can also reinforce these ideas by modeling using an appropriate pace, recognizing students’
individual contributions to group discussions, and pointing out conventions of language.


  - Explain to students that when working in whole/small groups, group members share responsibility
for the work they do together. To work effectively and respectfully, everyone should recognize the
contributions made by each group member. For example, as group members discuss a text, each
group member can share thoughts and reactions. If preparing to return to a whole-group discussion,
group members can summarize the group’s ideas by including contributions from everyone in the
group.


  - Consider using a discussion checklist that tracks student participation, as well as introducing
discussion techniques that enhance participation.


~~**TEKS 1.1.C; TEKS 1.1.D**~~


**TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using the conventions of language;
**TEKS 1.1.D** Work collaboratively with others by following agreed-upon rules for discussion, including listening to others, speaking when recognized, and making
appropriate contributions.

Unit 8 American Independence


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Introducing the Read-Aloud**

  - Display a world map to have students locate the continent, country, and state
in which they live.


**Read-Aloud**

  - Prepare and display an enlarged copy of the Thirteen Colonies Map on
Activity Page 1.1 to reference throughout the unit. Alternatively, a digital
version may be accessed in the online materials for this unit.


**Application**

  - Be prepared to discuss and sequence the three English colonies: Roanoke
Island (“The Lost Colony”), Jamestown, and Plymouth. Prepare Sequencing
Events Cards with the names and/or images of each of these. You may wish
to use Image Card 3 for Plymouth. Alternatively, you may access cards in the
Teacher Resources section of this Teacher Guide.


**Note to Teacher**


The intent of this first lesson is to review information that students have
learned earlier in the Kindergarten program. This knowledge provides the
foundation for subsequent lessons in this unit. If students have not already
participated in the Kindergarten program, it is not necessary to provide an
exhaustive review of each of these topics. Rather, the purpose is to orient
students to the topics that will be addressed in the Read-Aloud. The most
important information is included in the questions and answers for the
Introducing the Read-Aloud section.


You should also be aware that when texts refer to Pilgrims and other settlers
who came from England, those settlers are called English settlers because
they came from a country called England. Later, many years after the first
English settlers arrived in North America, the country of England became
part of a new and larger country known as the United Kingdom of Britain and
Northern Ireland, commonly referred to as Great Britain or simply Britain.
Because of this change, students will hear references to England and English
settlers when learning about the early colonial period before 1707, and they
will also hear references to Great Britain, Britain, and the British for the time
period after 1707.


**Universal Access**

  - Prepare to illustrate the relationship between the concepts of continent,
country, and state during the Introducing the Read-Aloud section by drawing
concentric circles on the board/chart paper.

###### Introducing the Read-Aloud


**Speaking and Listening:** Students will identify where and how the thirteen
colonies were formed.


~~**TEKS 1.1.C; TEKS 1.6.E**~~


~~**CORE CONNECTIONS (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that during the _Early American Civilizations_ unit, they
learned about several groups of people who lived in America before
Image Card 1
Columbus arrived. Ask students to recall where those people lived.
(present-day Mexico, Central and South America)


**Show Image Card 1 (Native Americans of the Past)**

  - Tell students that many tribes of Native Americans lived in the area that
is now the United States of America. Ask students to share anything they
remember from Kindergarten about how Native Americans lived.


**Show Image Card 2 (Columbus)** Image Card 2

  - Next tell students about the European explorer named Columbus. Explain to

students that Columbus traveled by ship to the Americas. Use the world map
or globe to point out Europe and the general transatlantic route taken by
Columbus in sailing to North America.


  - Tell students that the Native Americans were already living in America when
Columbus arrived.


**Show Image Card 3 (Pilgrims)** Image Card 3

  - Now explain to students that after Columbus’s voyages, more and more groups

of people from various countries in Europe decided to make the trip across the
Atlantic Ocean to explore North America. Tell students that one of these groups
who came from England and landed at Plymouth Rock were the Pilgrims.


  - Use the world map or globe to point out the approximate location of the
Pilgrims’ landing in Massachusetts.


  - Tell students that in today’s Read-Aloud, they will hear more about the Pilgrims
as well as two other early English colonies: Roanoke Island and Jamestown.


**TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using
the conventions of language; **TEKS 1.6.E** Make connections to personal experiences, ideas in other texts, and society with
adult assistance.

~~**WHERE ARE WE? (5 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** Younger students often confuse the concepts of country and state,
and when asked to name the country may respond by naming the state. If
this happens, be sure to acknowledge that they have accurately provided the
name of Texas in which they live, but that you are asking them to name the
country in which they live, of which their state is a part.


 - Draw three concentric circles on the board.


 - Ask students to name their state. (If students name their country, draw it in
the middle circle and identify it as their country. If they correctly name Texas,
draw it in the smallest, inside circle and identify it as their state.)


 - Ask students to name their country (if students have already named their
country, remind them that the United States is their country and is larger
than their state, that’s why the middle circle goes around the inside one).
Tell students that there has not always been a country or nation known as
the United States of America made up of different states such as Texas. Tell
students that for the next several days they will be learning about some of
the important events and people responsible for the creation of our country,
the United States of America.


 - Ask students to name the continent on which the United States of America
is located. The continent is bigger than the country, and it’s called “North
America.” Write “North America” in the largest circle.


 - Show or project a world map or globe. Flip Book Image 1A-1: North America
may be used for this activity.


 - Point to “North America” in the concentric circles. Point to or mark the
continent on the map.


 - Point to “United States of America” in the concentric circles. Point to or mark
the country on the map.


 - Point to “Texas” in the concentric circles. Point to or mark the state on the map.

North America. Tell them that in today’s Read-Aloud they are going to learn
about some of the other places in North America where the English settled,
both before and after the Pilgrims’ arrival. Ask students to listen to find out
about other English settlements in North America.


~~**“A NEW AGE” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 1A-1: North America**

This is the North American continent, where

we live today. ~~_The portion in red is the United_~~

North America was very different than it is

today.





**Show Image 1A-2: Native Americans of the**
**past**


~~_[Ask students to describe what they see in_~~
~~_this illustration.]_~~
The first people who lived in North America
are known as Native Americans. The Native
Americans lived in groups called tribes in
different regions of North America. There were
no stores like we have now, so they had to find or make most things they
needed to survive, whether it was food to eat, clothing to wear, or a house in
which to live.


**TEKS 1.6.I** Monitor comprehension and make adjustments such as re-reading, using background knowledge, checking for
visual cues, and asking questions when understanding breaks down; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and texts the student is able

**Show Image 1A-3: Columbus aboard ship**

Hundreds of years later, a European explorer by

the name of Christopher Columbus sailed and

reached North America, but that was not where

he had planned to go. ~~_[Point to the illustration_~~

~~_of Columbus.] Tell students that Columbus was_~~

~~_looking for spices, gold, and other treasures_~~

~~_when he first set sail from Europe._~~ Columbus



set sail from Europe, hoping to find a quicker way to reach India and China,

where spices, gold, and other riches were legendary.


**Show Image 1A-4: Columbus and**
**Native Americans**

But in 1492, when Columbus actually reached

land, after he “sailed the ocean blue,” he thought

he landed somewhere near India, so he called the

people Indians. That’s where the term _Indians_ comes





from. But Columbus was mistaken. These were

**Show Image 1A-5: World map**
After Columbus, sailors from different
countries in Europe traveled to North America.
Portugal, the Dutch Republic (now the
Netherlands), Spain, France, and England all
sent explorers to North America, continuing
to hope to find riches and goods that they
might bring back to trade and sell in Europe.

~~_[Point to North America and Europe on the_~~

Europeans called the “New World.” ~~_[Remind students that the European_~~

**Show Image 1A-6: Thanksgiving: Pilgrims and**
**Native Americans**

~~_[Point to the illustration and ask students if they_~~

~~_recognize the event that is shown. (Thanksgiving)]_~~

The English did not want to just visit the

Americas. They were interested in starting

**settlements** in order to live there. ~~_When people_~~

~~_start settlements, they move to a new place to live._~~



They wanted a place for their people to spread out from their small island country,

England, across the Atlantic Ocean. Many were also looking for a place where they

could have more religious freedom. This means they wanted the freedom to pray,

worship, and practice their religion in any way they chose. You probably remember

that English Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock in the 1600s, about a hundred

years after Columbus. The Pilgrims had great difficulty adjusting to their life in the

Americas because it was very different from the city life they knew in Europe. The

Native Americans that the Pilgrims met helped them survive, especially during

that first year, and they had a feast together to give thanks for their blessings. We

have a celebration called Thanksgiving every November to give thanks just as the

Pilgrims did.


**Show Image 1A-7: Map of the United States**
**of America with Massachusetts, Virginia, and**
**North Carolina highlighted**

The Pilgrims were not the only English people

to start settlements in North America. In fact,

before the Pilgrims ever arrived at Plymouth






~~_[Point to Massachusetts.] This is where the_~~

~~_Pilgrims landed and lived._~~, other English men



and women had settled in two other places. The first English colony was on

Roanoke Island ~~_[Point to the area off the coast of North Carolina.]_~~, followed

by a **colony** at Jamestown. ~~_[Point to Virginia.]_~~ A colony is a place that is

ruled by a faraway country. So, the English men and women who moved to

and settled Roanoke Island and Jamestown did not make their own rules or

laws. The English king and **government** ruled the colonies. ~~_A government is a_~~

~~_group of people who make decisions and laws for the people they represent._~~


Lesson 1 A New Age

**Show Image 1A-8: Baptism of Virginia Dare**

The first child born in North America to

English parents was born on Roanoke Island.

Her name was Virginia Dare. ~~_Explain that_~~

~~_the people are English settlers watching_~~

~~_the baptism of Virginia Dare. A baptism is a_~~

~~_Christian religious ceremony._~~



We don’t really know what happened to Virginia Dare or the other English

settlers living on Roanoke Island, because they mysteriously disappeared

several years after they arrived. For this reason, Roanoke Colony is often

called “The Lost Colony.” ~~_The colony was not really lost, but the colonists were_~~

~~_never seen again._~~ Some people think life was so difficult on Roanoke Island

that the colonists left their settlement and went to live with some of the

Native American tribes in the area. Some people think the Roanoke Island

settlers may have gone to live with the Native Americans because they may

have run out of food.


**Show Image 1A-9: English landing at**
**Jamestown**

It was another twenty years after the Roanoke

Colony, in 1607, when the English tried to settle

again in North America. One hundred men and

boys sailed up a river from the Atlantic Ocean and





named the river “James” in honor of the king of

England. The settlement they **founded** was called

“Jamestown.”

although Texas was not

Like the other English settlers, the people who came to Jamestown met the Native

Americans who were already living in this area. The English wanted to trade goods

with them and were especially interested in acquiring the Native Americans’

beaver and deer skins to send back to England, where they were able to sell them

for a high price.

**Show Image 1A-10: Map of thirteen colonies**

As time passed, more and more settlers from

Great Britain arrived in North America. ~~_[Remind_~~

~~_students that at this time, many years after the_~~

~~_first English colonists arrived in North America,_~~

~~_the country they came from was_~~

~~_now known as Great Britain or Britain.]_~~ All up

and down the East Coast of North America



they formed more colonies, where they started new lives for themselves. By

1732, there were thirteen British colonies in North America ~~_[Point to each on_~~

~~_the map.]_~~ : Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New

York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,

South Carolina, and Georgia. ~~_The people living in the thirteen colonies in North_~~

~~_America were ruled and controlled by the king and government of Britain._~~


**Show Image 1A-11: Map showing route from**
**Africa to North America**

British settlers included a lot of people looking

to find a better life in the New World. Some of

these settlers paid their own way to be on the

ships from England. Others came as indentured

servants. These indentured servants had to

work for the English colonists only for a certain,

agreed-upon number of years without pay. After that time, they were free to

live and work where they wanted, and to be paid for that work.


Unfortunately, some people did not come freely to the New World. Europeans

took people from the continent of Africa who were forced to work as slaves

in the Americas. ~~_[Point to Africa and trace the route from that continent_~~

~~_to North America.]_~~ These enslaved people were forced to come to North

America, where they did not share the **freedoms** enjoyed by the colonists.

~~_Freedoms are rights or liberties._~~ They could not leave their farms without

permission, and it was against the law for anyone to teach them to read or

write.


As the colonists settled in the colonies, more changes were to come.

~~**“A TAXING TIME: THE BOSTON TEA PARTY” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 2A-1: Map of the thirteen**

**colonies**

For a long time, many colonists were proud to

be British citizens, ruled by the king of Great

Britain. But then things began to change. The

king and the British Parliament had spent





a lot of money helping to set up and protect

the colonies. To help pay for these expenses



and fund other expenses of Great Britain and the king, Parliament decided to

make the colonies in America pay **taxes** to Great Britain.


**Show Image 2A-2: How taxation works**

Taxes are extra money people must pay when

they buy certain things. For example, today, we

may pay taxes when we buy clothes at a

department store, food in a restaurant, or

gasoline for the car. Depending on what the





sales tax is in your part of Texas, you might

have to pay a dollar or two more for your new



shirt than what’s listed on the price tag, or a few extra cents for your

sandwich than the price listed on the menu. But these stores do not keep

this extra money.


**TEKS 1.7.C** Use text evidence to support an appropriate response; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and texts the student is able
to read or hear to learn or clarify word meanings.


Unit 8 American Independence


They must give the extra money, or taxes, to the government. These days, we

vote and elect **representatives**, ~~_or people to represent us in government_~~ .

These people make decisions about how to best spend taxes to provide

public services that benefit all who live here. ~~_[You may wish to briefly name_~~

~~_one representative of your locality and say, “Citizens voted for this person to_~~

~~_represent us in government. This person speaks for the people who live here.”]_~~

The government uses the taxes to help pay for things that everybody needs,

like schools, public transportation, roads, water and garbage service, police

and fire protection, and other public services.


**Show Image 2A-3: British Parliament**

But back in the time when the colonies were

first established, the people who lived in the

colonies were not permitted to vote and elect

representatives or people to represent them

in the British Parliament on the other side





of the ocean. ~~_[Tell students that the room in_~~

~~_this image is one of the rooms in Great Britain_~~



~~_in which the British Parliament meets.]_~~ So, many people who lived in the

American colonies in the 1700s felt that it was unfair for the British king to

ask them to pay taxes without being represented. The colonists were asked

to pay extra for stamps, sugar, and other things. Because the colonists could

not voice their opinions to the British government through representatives,

why, they wondered, should they have to pay taxes? Taxation without

representation just didn’t seem fair to them.

help very much. ~~_The people in the colony of_~~



~~_Massachusetts were really mad about paying taxes!_~~ Then, in 1773, the British

Parliament did something that the colonists could not stand. They passed

a law called the Tea Act and tried to force the colonists to buy tea from one

British company only, charging a large tax for the tea. The colonists did not

think it was fair to force them to pay more for tea, and they refused to pay

taxes on tea, one of their favorite drinks.

They began sending shiploads of tea back to Britain and ordering tea from

the Dutch Republic instead. ~~_The Dutch Republic was the name of the country_~~

~~_we know as the Netherlands today._~~ This made the king even angrier. He told

them that they could not send any more tea back to Great Britain without

paying the tax. Because of this, the colonists of Massachusetts **revolted**, ~~_or_~~

king’s decision. ~~_Why do you think the colonists ordered tea from the Dutch_~~

the port of Boston, Massachusetts. ~~_A port is a_~~

~~_place on the coast where ships load and unload_~~

~~_goods._~~ On a December night in 1773, a group

of men known as the Sons of Liberty planned





a most unusual “tea party.” ~~_If we were going to_~~

~~_have a tea party, what might we do? Listen to_~~

Here, _goods_ are things
that can be traded,
bought, or sold. The
word _good_ can also mean
enjoyable, obedient,
positive, or better
than average.


**30**



~~_see if that is the kind of tea party the Sons of Liberty had._~~ Smearing their faces

with soot, grease, and streaks of red paint, they stuck feathers in their hair.

Disguised as Mohawk Native Americans, a common symbol of freedom at the

time, they made their way down to the **harbor**, ~~_or the water along the coast._~~

Climbing aboard three British ships, they dumped 342 chests of valuable tea

into the Boston Harbor. This meant that the British lost tea and money. This

event became known as the Boston Tea Party.


**Show Image 2A-6: Paul Revere’s shop in**

**Boston**

Furious, King George of Great Britain closed

the port of Boston, one of the American

colonies’ most important ports. He told them

that they would not receive any more **goods**

from Britain until they paid for the tea that

they had destroyed. With no supplies coming

from Great Britain, there was nothing for the colonists to sell in their shops,

so people had to close their shops. ~~_[Point to the image and explain that it is_~~

~~_a shop in Boston that was owned by a man named Paul Revere. Tell students_~~

~~_they will hear more about Paul Revere in the next Read-Aloud.]_~~ Many people

lost their jobs. Food was scarce. Colonists from up and down the East Coast

helped out, sending money and supplies to Massachusetts.


Unit 8 American Independence


What were the colonists to do? What should they say to the British king?


The people of Boston began to talk of war against Great Britain and its

king, but other colonists warned them not to act so quickly. These colonists

suggested that the people wait a bit because they thought it was not a good

idea to fight back without thinking about it first.


**Show Image 2A-7: First Continental Congress**

All thirteen colonies decided to come up with

a plan together. They held a big meeting in

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, about midway

between the farthest New England colonies





and the farthest Southern colonies. ~~_[Point out_~~

~~_Philadelphia on a U.S. map. Review the location_~~

~~_of the thirteen colonies.]_~~ Each colony elected



representatives to attend the meeting. ~~_It wasn’t possible for all colonists to_~~

~~_attend the meeting, so each colony sent a few people to speak for them._~~ It was

the first time that representatives from all the colonies (except Georgia) met

together in one place. They called themselves the Continental Congress.


Leaders in the colonies were divided. Some remained loyal, or faithful, to

Great Britain and the king. They were called Loyalists. After all, they argued

that they were British, too. Others were beginning to think of themselves not

as British citizens, but as Americans. They wanted to rule themselves instead

of being ruled by a faraway king. These people were called Patriots.


**Show Image 2A-8: George Washington,**
**Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson**

~~_[Point to each person in the image as you read_~~

~~_about him.]_~~

Members of the Continental Congress included

George Washington from Virginia, a young





army commander who had helped protect

the colonies. Benjamin Franklin attended the



second meeting of the Continental Congress; he was a Philadelphian known

for his ability to get people to work together. Though unable to attend, Thomas

Jefferson, known as an excellent writer, was elected as a representative from

Virginia. ~~_[Point to the men again, and have students repeat the names of these_~~

~~_three men after you.]_~~

Challenge


When you stop buying
and/or selling goods out
of protest, it is called
boycotting.


**32**



At that first Continental Congress, the representatives decided to approach

the king in a friendly way. They sent him a letter, telling him that they wanted

to work things out peacefully. They asked the British Parliament to stop

making laws, or rules, for them. “We feel that we should create our own

laws since we are not able to vote for laws in Parliament,” they said. In the

meantime, while they waited for an answer from the king, the colonists

decided to stop selling goods to Great Britain and to stop buying goods from

Great Britain.


**Show Image 2A-9: Carpenters’ Hall, location**
**of First Continental Congress**

~~_[Point out that the representatives met in this_~~

~~_building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.]_~~

At the end of the meeting, the colonists were

still split in their opinions about what to do. The





Loyalists hoped that the king would grant their

requests, letting them make their own laws



while still remaining British. The Patriots kept things stirred up, talking of going

to war and breaking away from Britain altogether. ~~_So the Loyalists and Patriots_~~

~~_did not agree about what to do. The Loyalists were loyal to whom? The Patriots_~~

~~_wanted to make their own laws. Did they want to obey the king anymore?_~~ It

certainly was not a calm time!

~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Inferential.** What are taxes, and what are they used for? _(extra money paid_
_for goods you buy that government uses to help pay for public services, such_
_as schools, police and fire protection, water and garbage services, etc.)_


2. **Literal.** What is a representative? _(someone elected to represent a larger_
_group of people in the government; helps the government decide what to_
_spend taxes on)_


3. **Literal.** Why did the king and the British Parliament decide to tax the British
colonies in America? _(They wanted to get some money; the British Parliament_
_had spent a lot of money to help set up and protect the colonies.)_

    -    - **Literal.** How did the British colonists feel about being taxed? _(They_
_disagreed with it; they were angry.)_ Why do you think they felt that way?
_(They didn’t have representatives in Parliament.)_


4. **Literal.** What was the Boston Tea Party? _(In protest, the colonists dumped_
_tea into the Boston Harbor.)_


5. **Literal.** What was the colonists’ next plan for solving the problem with the
British king? _(They had a meeting called the First Continental Congress and_
_wrote the king a letter.)_


Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** Did the Boston Tea Party solve the problem
of tea being taxed? _(no)_ How do you know the problem wasn’t
solved? _(The king was furious and closed the port so that no more_
_supplies could come into Massachusetts; the colonists didn’t have_
_anything to sell in their stores, which led to more problems.)_


    - **Literal.** Did everyone agree on what should be done? _(No, some_
_colonists—the Loyalists—wanted to remain loyal to the king, while others—_

  - Tell students that the First Continental Congress was a group of colonists
who met together to help make decisions for the colonies. The colonies had
too many people for every single person’s vote to be heard, so they sent
representatives to speak and make choices on their behalf.


  - Explain to students that when the First Continental Congress met, there
was a lot happening in the colonies. Many colonists felt scared. The First
Continental Congress had many important decisions to be made. It was a
stressful time.

~~**“THE FIRST DEBATE” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 3A-1: The Boston Tea Party**

The year was 1774. America was not a

country—not yet. It was made up of thirteen

British colonies ruled by the king of Great

Britain. But the colonists were angry.

They were angry over taxes. In December of

the year before, in Boston, a group of colonists

climbed onto three British ships and dumped

chests of valuable tea into the Boston Harbor.


**Show Image 3A-2: Quaker meeting house**

Many people who lived in the colonies had

other concerns beyond taxes. Many colonists

came to America to have religious freedom.

~~_Religious freedom means being able to freely_~~

~~_practice religion without the government telling_~~

~~_you how._~~ The pilgrims who landed at Plymouth

Rock, in what would become the colony of

Massachusetts, wanted to be able to pray to their God without being told how

to pray. Even outside of Massachusetts, in the other original thirteen colonies,

colonists worshiped in different ways. ~~_[Point to map of thirteen colonies]_~~ Many

people from a religious group known as the Quakers left England and went to

Pennsylvania, where they had the freedom to worship. Back in England, Quakers

were sometimes put into prison for praying the wrong way. Catholic believers

established a strong group of churches in Maryland in a way that was not

permitted in England. A number of Jewish settlers arrived first in New York, and

then in several other colonies, thriving in a land where they had the freedom

to worship. These religious groups thrived in the colonies, alongside a large

number of colonists who were members of the Anglican Church, which was the

official Church of England.


**Show Image 3A-3: Carpenters’ Hall,**
**Philadelphia**

There were a lot of different people in the

thirteen colonies, with many colonists angry

at Great Britain. But they all wanted to

keep the freedoms they held dear. In

September 1774, people in the colonies sent

representatives to meet in Philadelphia to

discuss what to do and how to do it. It was the First Continental Congress.

The United States had not yet gained its independence. Many of the

representatives at this First Continental Congress meeting wanted to stay a

part of Great Britain. Even so, today many think of the meeting of the First

Continental Congress as the first time we were truly Americans. Before this,

there were thirteen separate British colonies. But with this congress, our

country started to try to govern itself.


**Show Image 3A-4: Founding Fathers**

This was a big deal in American history and in

the history of the world. At that time, and for

thousands of years before, almost all of the

nations on the planet were ruled by kings or

queens. And in most of the nations where a king

ruled, the king required every citizen of that

nation to worship in the same way that the king

did. These nations had an official religion.

The First Continental Congress would be the first time American

representatives came together to discuss how to govern themselves. Many

of these representatives were important leaders who helped start our

country—they are also known as our Founding Fathers. They included George

Washington, John Adams, Samuel Adams, and others. There would be many

disagreements and many **debates** . ~~_Debates are discussions between people_~~

~~_on both sides of an argument in order to come to an agreement._~~ But perhaps

the first full debate at this first meeting of what would eventually become the

American government was about whether to pray.


**Show Image 3A-5: Samuel Adams**

On September 5, 1774, the First Continental

Congress met for the first time. They met with

heavy hearts. They had heard rumors that

British ships had attacked the town of Boston.

Representatives worried about the safety

of friends and family in Boston. Many were

beginning to realize that the well-being of their

colonies was going to rely on coming together

despite their differences.


As the representatives settled into their seats, a man named Thomas

Cushing suggested they begin each **session**, ~~_or meeting_~~, with a prayer. Some

of Cushing’s fellow **delegates** argued against beginning the sessions with a

prayer. ~~_Delegates are people who are sent to represent or act for other people_~~

~~_in a meeting._~~ They pointed out that the representatives were not just from

different colonies, but they also sometimes had different religious beliefs.


Then Samuel Adams stood up. His home was in Boston, so he was as

worried as anyone about the safety of his family and friends. He argued that

the representatives could join together in prayer, despite their differences.

He said that he could hear a prayer from a good man who loved his country

even if he had different religious beliefs. He argued that they may have

different ways of worshiping God, but they could still come together for their

country. It was a **compromise** —the first of many that would be reached by

the founders of our nation. ~~_When people compromise, it means that both_~~

~~_sides work together to come to an agreement or make a decision. In this case,_~~

~~_the representatives worked together to make a decision that people could_~~

~~_pray without being judged based on their religious beliefs._~~


Unit 8 American Independence


**Show Image 3A-6: At prayer**

Samuel Adams proposed that the congress

invite Reverend Jacob Duché to begin the

next session with a prayer. This was notable

because Reverend Duché was an Anglican,

and Adams was part of a religious group that

traced back to Puritans who had escaped

the Anglican Church in England. Back in

England, their religious differences would

sometimes lead to real problems, including possibly being put in jail. But

the first debate of the First Continental Congress ended with the group of

American representatives with different religious beliefs welcoming prayer.

The following Wednesday, Duché opened the congressional session with a

special prayer asking for God’s help in their effort to gain fair treatment from

Britain. The **representatives** received the prayer well. John Adams said that

the prayer gave a “warm patriotic feeling.”


**Show Image 3A-7: First Continental Congress**

There were many other issues to debate at

the First Continental Congress. Patriots kept

stirring things up, talking of going to war

and breaking away from Britain altogether.

There was no agreement on whether to

break away from Great Britain. But there

was the beginning of compromise among

representatives for the sake of religious

freedom. The First Continental Congress ended its meetings, and the

representatives returned to their homes. The conflict between the colonies

and Great Britain was not going away.


Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** What is religious freedom? _(Answers may vary_
_but should include the ability to freely practice religion without the_
_government telling you how.)_



Support


Remind students that
when the First Continental
Congress met, the
colonists were still
figuring out how to work
together. Many had come
to America looking for
religious freedom. This
meant that many colonists
worshiped in different
ways. The representatives
wanted God involved in
their sessions in different
ways, which led to
debates.

**Note to Teacher**


The Read-Aloud in this lesson follows Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s
poem, “Paul Revere’s Ride,” which has become a legend. You may wish to
review the term _legend_ with students. It is highly recommended that you
preface the Read-Aloud by telling students that parts of this story are true
but other parts were made up by the author. Tell students that they will learn
more about Paul Revere in later grades. For now, the most important things
for students to gain familiarity with are his ride as a patriotic gesture, and
commonly used phrases from Longfellow’s poem (e.g., “One, if by land, and
two, if by sea.”).


It is worth noting that Paul Revere was a real man, and he did make a ride
similar to the one told here to save fellow Sons of Liberty Samuel Adams and
John Hancock from arrest. While riding his horse on the way to where they
were staying, he was incredibly boisterous and noisy, waking many along his
path. His fellow Patriots, you might note, were not particularly pleased by
this (British soldiers or spies, for example, could have quickly discerned what
was happening), but when Henry Wadsworth Longfellow immortalized the
man with his poem “Paul Revere’s Ride” in 1860, Revere became a symbol of
American patriotism.


**Universal Access**

 - Display the Thirteen Colonies Map to locate Massachusetts as mentioned in
the Read-Aloud.


 - Gather an image of shutters to show students and explain how they could be
opened and closed to allow or block light and air.

~~**“THE SHOT HEARD ROUND THE WORLD” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 4A-1: Massachusetts unrest**

After the Boston Tea Party, King George sent

thousands of British soldiers to Boston to make

sure the colonists **obeyed** the king’s orders, ~~_or_~~

~~_to make sure that the colonists did as the king_~~

~~_ordered them to do_~~ . They swarmed the streets

of the city in their fancy red uniforms with

shiny buttons, earning themselves the name

“Redcoats.” They carried weapons with them everywhere they went. This made

the people of Boston very angry. The city no longer felt like home to them.

They did not know whom to trust. **Spies**, ~~_or people who secretly kept watch on_~~

~~_other people to try to figure out what they were up to_~~, spread out all over the

city—British soldiers disguised as colonists, and colonists disguised as British

soldiers. There was lots of whispering in the streets as people kept secrets

from one another. It was not very pleasant and even a little scary.


**Show Image 4A-2: Paul Revere**

Paul Revere was a silversmith living in Boston.

As a silversmith, he was kept quite busy

making and repairing silver dinnerware,

candlesticks, and jewelry. A sign with a silver

pitcher hung outside his shop on the town

square. ~~_In those days, it was common for_~~

~~_shopkeepers to hang signs above their doors with pictures of what could be_~~

~~_bought inside their shops. Do you remember the picture of the Boston shop_~~

~~_you saw in the previous Read-Aloud? That was a picture of Paul Revere’s_~~

~~_silversmith shop._~~ One day, the door to his shop flew open and a friend rushed

over to Revere’s side. The two men were both members of the Sons of

Liberty, the group of Patriots who had emptied tea into Boston’s harbor.


Ever since the Boston Tea Party, the colonists of Massachusetts had been

hiding weapons, gunpowder, and cannonballs in neighboring towns. The

British, afraid the colonists might be planning to attack them, captured the

weapons whenever they learned where they were hidden. ~~_Why do you think_~~

~~_the colonists might have started hiding these materials?_~~


**Show Image 4A-3: Paul Revere and his**

**friend conferring**

Now, as the two men huddled together in the

back of Revere’s shop, his friend whispered that

the British were planning to raid the colonists’

storehouse of weapons in the town of Concord.

The British were to travel that night, he said, but

nobody knew whether they would march there

by land or choose the shorter route and sail on a boat by sea. The Patriots knew

they must somehow warn the **militia** in Concord that the British were coming by

sea. ~~_A militia is an army of ordinary people, not trained soldiers._~~


Revere and others spied on, ~~_or secretly watched over_~~, the British to discover

the soldiers’ plans. When Revere learned the troops were coming, he

arranged for a **signal** to be given, a secret code. His friend was to climb up

the bell tower of the Old North Church. “Light one lantern and hang it in the

belfry, ~~_or bell tower_~~, if the British are traveling on foot by land,” Revere told

his friend. “But if they are traveling on a boat by sea, hang two lanterns.”


**Show Image 4A-4: Paul Revere looking at**
**the signal**

Paul Revere left his family and crept down

to the banks of the Charles River. He quietly

crossed the river in a boat to a spot where he

borrowed a horse from his friend and fellow

Patriot. Paul Revere mounted the horse, tipped

his hat in thanks to the Patriots, and sped away.

**the alarm**

As he galloped through towns along the way,

Revere shouted to the colonists in their beds,

“The Redcoats are coming! The Redcoats are

coming!” All around him, shutters were thrown

open as people began waking in the middle of

the night.


When Revere reached the town of Lexington with word of the approaching

British troops, men hurried from their homes, joining one another with

their muskets in the middle of the town. These men, known as Minutemen

because they were expected to be ready to fight at a minute’s notice, slept

with their muskets and gunpowder beside their beds. Revere was joined by

a second rider, William Dawes, who had been sent on the same mission but

following a different path to Lexington.


**Show Image 4A-6: Battle of Lexington**

At dawn, the British reached Lexington. The

Minutemen were farmers and shopkeepers—

**volunteers** for their country, not trained

soldiers. ~~_Volunteers choose to do a job without_~~

~~_being paid._~~ They looked ragged next to the

well-dressed British soldiers, or Redcoats.

In the confusion of the early morning hours,

a shot was fired. Others fired back, and fighting continued throughout the

morning. Finally, Minutemen were able to force the British to return to

Boston, firing at them from behind rocks, trees, and fences all along the way.

To this day, no one knows who fired the first shot that day. Nerves had been

on edge since the Boston Tea Party, so it is not surprising that guns went off.


Unit 8 American Independence



**60**


That first shot was the beginning of a long war between the British and their

American colonies. It is known as “the shot heard round the world” because

not only did it change life in the colonies, but it also changed things around

the world in Great Britain, all the way across the Atlantic Ocean. ~~_[On a globe,_~~

~~_point out that Great Britain is on the other side of the world from the British_~~

~~_colonies, so the people in Great Britain couldn’t actually hear the shot fired_~~

~~_that morning. Explain that this famous saying simply means that that shot_~~

~~_had a big effect on Great Britain and on the entire world.]_~~ That long war

became known as the Revolutionary War. Could it be that “the shot heard

round the world” rang out so loudly from the Massachusetts colony that it

actually reached King George’s ears that April morning? What do you think?

~~_[Pause for students to share ideas.]_~~


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What is the main topic of this Read-Aloud? ( _Paul Revere helped_
_get the Minutemen prepared to fight the British, and the Revolutionary War_
_started with the battle at Lexington._ )


2. **Literal.** Who were the Redcoats? ( _the British army_ ) Who were the
Minutemen? ( _the colonial militia_ )


3. **Evaluative.** Why do you think Paul Revere warned colonists that the
Redcoats were coming? ( _He was a Patriot._ )


4. **Inferential.** What does the well-known phrase “one, if by land, and two, if
by sea” mean? ( _It refers to a signal. One lantern meant the Redcoats were_
_coming by land, and two meant they were coming by sea._ )


Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** What was “the shot heard round the world”?
( _the beginning of fighting between the Redcoats and Minutemen at_
_Lexington that started the Revolutionary War_ ) Do you think there
would have been a “shot heard round the world” if the Minutemen
had not been prepared? ( _Answers may vary._ )


Lesson 4 The Shot Heard Round the World

~~**WORD WORK: VOLUNTEERS (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “The Minutemen were farmers and
shopkeepers—volunteers for their country, not trained soldiers.”


2. Say the word _volunteers_ with me.


3. _Volunteers_ are people who do something without being paid or told
to do something.


4. There are many volunteers at the fire station.


5. Have I ever asked for volunteers in the classroom? Can you think of some
other places where volunteers might help out? Try to use the word _volunteers_
when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or
rephrase the students’ responses: “The volunteers helped . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I will describe a situation.
If it describes people helping out without being paid or told to do something,
you will say, “They are volunteers.” If it does not, you will say, “They are
not volunteers.”


   - Tony and John were paid ten dollars to rake the leaves in their
neighbor’s yard. ( _They are not volunteers._ )


   - Lisa and Pablo offered to pick up the litter on the playground.
( _They are volunteers._ )


   - The teacher was amazed that ten students asked if they could help
clean up the art supplies. ( _They are volunteers._ )


   - Maria and Hannah were paid five dollars to babysit their little brother.

( _They are not volunteers._ )


   - Jeff and Leila asked if they could take their grandparents’ dog
for a walk. ( _They are volunteers._ )

**“Let the Cat Out of the Bag”**

  - Ask students if they have ever heard the saying “let the cat out of the bag.”
Have students repeat the saying.

  - Explain that if someone “let the cat out of the bag,” that person told a secret.
Explain that the Redcoats were probably angry that Paul Revere “let the cat
out of the bag” by warning the colonists that the Redcoats were coming. In
other words, Paul Revere told the Redcoats’ secret.

  - Ask students if they have ever “let the cat out of the bag” or if they knew
someone else who “let the cat out of the bag.” For example, share the
following example with students:


_My sister let the cat out of the bag and told me about the surprise party_
_my mom was planning for me._


  - Give students the opportunity to share their experiences and encourage
them to use the saying.

**Show Image 5A-3: George Washington**

General George Washington seemed to be the

perfect choice to lead the army. He had fought

to protect the colonies before and he knew

how the British fought. Dressed in his military

uniform at the Continental Congress, he was

respected by everyone and was easily elected

as the **commander in chief** of the Continental

Army. ~~_George Washington would be in charge of the army created by the_~~

~~_Continental Congress._~~ Washington set off to join troops from across the

colonies in Massachusetts, ready to meet the British in battle.


Meanwhile, the Continental Congress continued to meet in Philadelphia.


**Show Image 5A-4: Benjamin Franklin**

Among the representatives was a man named

Benjamin Franklin. Franklin, who was born

in the colony of Massachusetts and then

lived in the colony of Pennsylvania, had

actually moved to London, England, for a

few years. He had gone there to speak out in

Parliament against the unfair taxing of the

American colonies and the fact that the Americans had no say in Parliament.

~~_Americans had no official representatives to speak out for them in Parliament,_~~

~~_but Franklin went and spoke as their representative._~~ Benjamin Franklin was

very good at arguing, and he was able to get the British to remove some of

their taxes on the colonies. Benjamin Franklin had many British friends in

London, but after the Boston Tea Party, an angry British Parliament began to

distrust and dislike him. ~~_Why do you think the British Parliament started to_~~

~~_dislike Franklin?_~~ And so, in 1775, Franklin decided that it was time to return

home, arriving in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, just in time for the second

meeting of the Continental Congress. The other representatives were

delighted to have someone there who had spent so much time on the other

side of the ocean. He could help them decide what to do. The representatives

elected Franklin to be President of the Second Continental Congress.

**Congress**

The Continental Congress decided it was time

to announce to Parliament and to the British

king that the colonies no longer wanted to be

a part of Great Britain. They wanted to declare

themselves a free and independent nation. An

official **declaration** would have to be written

so that Parliament and the king would take

them seriously.


Who would write this important Declaration of Independence, ~~_or this_~~

~~_statement to declare the colonists free_~~ ? The members of the Continental

Congress considered different people.


**Show Image 5A-6: Thomas Jefferson writing**

Among those mentioned for the job was

Thomas Jefferson, a thirty-two-year-old

representative from Virginia, and one of the

youngest men there. Jefferson had not been

able to attend the First Continental Congress,

but the representatives were all familiar with

his powerful writing. Jefferson was elected to

be its author. ~~_What would Jefferson do if he was going to be the author of the_~~

~~_Declaration of Independence?_~~


Thomas Jefferson went back to the rooms he was renting in Philadelphia, got

out some paper, and scratched his head. He dipped his pen in ink and started

writing. ~~_Pens in those days did not hold the ink; the pen had to be dipped into_~~

~~_the bottle of ink._~~ Sometimes he stopped and crossed out some words, then

went on. He knew a lot of important people were going to read this, so he had

to make it good. Every morning for seventeen days, he got up at dawn and

got to work, writing and rewriting to make sure it was his best work.


The Continental Congress liked Thomas Jefferson’s work. Benjamin Franklin,

among others, removed some text and changed a word or two in a few other

places, but most of the words remained those of young Jefferson.


Unit 8 American Independence


**Show Image 5A-7: Declaration**

**of Independence**

On July 4, 1776, the Declaration of

Independence was **approved** by a vote of the

Continental Congress. It was sent to a printing

shop that very night. Riders headed out across

the countryside with copies. In town squares

all over the colonies, people gathered to hear

Thomas Jefferson’s words read aloud. One part is still read again and again

today: ~~_I want you listen to a part of our Declaration of Independence, and then_~~

~~_I will explain to you what it means._~~


_We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,_


_that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,_


_that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness._


People all over the world should have equal rights, ~~_such as the right to_~~

~~_live, the right to liberty (which means freedom), and the right to be happy._~~

Sometimes, when we use the word men, it means people, both men and

women. When Thomas Jefferson wrote “all men are created equal,” “endowed

by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,” he meant that all people

were created equal by God and have certain rights (which include life, liberty,

and the pursuit of happiness) given to them by God which the government

cannot take away.


**Show Image 5A-8: Independence Day**

That day in 1776, when the Declaration of

Independence was signed, was an important

event. We still celebrate this important

event, which is called Independence Day,

Unit 8 American Independence


~~**WORD WORK: INDEPENDENT (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “The representatives to the Second Continental
Congress were divided in their feelings about breaking away from Britain and
becoming a completely independent nation.”


2. Say the word _independent_ with me.


3. _Independent_ means not controlled by others.


4. Canada, the United States of America, and Mexico are three independent
nations on the continent of North America. (Explain that the word
_independent_ can also be used to describe a person. An independent
person is able to take care of himself/herself.)


5. Who would you describe as an independent person? Try to use the word
_independent_ when you tell about that person. [Ask two or three students.
If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses: “ is an
independent person because . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use an Antonyms activity for follow-up.** The opposite, or antonym, of
_independent_ is _dependent_ . An independent person does for himself/herself

work together in groups to write captions for it.


- Encourage students to share sentences describing what is happening
in the picture using important details as you previously discussed
(e.g., “The representatives from the colonies in the Second Continental
Congress are discussing a serious document.”).


- Ask students questions regarding the content to help build on this initial
description (e.g., “Do we know the names of any of the men who were there?”
“What was the Declaration of Independence?”)


- As students form complete sentences, have students assign a scribe to write
them on an index card. For example, it may look like something like this:








  - When students have finished writing their captions, place them near the
image in a designated area of your room. Ask several groups to share
their captions.

Kindergarten program, they will have already learned briefly about the
American flag during the _America: Our Great Country_ unit.
Help students to understand a flag is a piece of cloth with special designs
that is a symbol of a country, state, etc. This new flag Betsy Ross made is
important because it is a symbol of America.


 - Ask students if they know what the flag of the United States looks like.

_(red, white, and blue; red and white stripes; fifty stars)_


 - Explain that the flag Betsy Ross designed in the legend they will hear today
looked similar to the one we have now, but not exactly the same.

repair things made of cloth. John hung a sign outside their house at 239 Arch

Street. The needle and spool of thread helped people find their shop.


**Show Image 6A-2: Boston Tea Party**

At about the same time that Betsy and John

were having a party to celebrate their wedding,

Patriots in Boston were having their own party,

the Boston Tea Party. And you remember what

a party that was! The Patriots used the sea as

a giant teapot, dumping shiploads of tea into it.

After that night, the colonies decided to work

together to come up with a plan for answering the British demand for taxes.

The meeting of representatives from all thirteen colonies, the First Continental

Congress, was held in the Ross’ hometown of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

**Show Image 6A-3: Colonial Philadelphia**

Midway between the New England colonies and

the Southern colonies, Pennsylvania was an

important meeting place for colonists from all

over. John and Betsy found it an exciting city in

which to live, especially as the Patriots began to

gather there. John agreed with the Patriot cause

and wanted to break away from Great Britain.

One night, Betsy’s husband, John, died suddenly. It was very sad and not yet

three years since Betsy and John Ross had celebrated their wedding day.


**Show Image 6A-4: Betsy Ross running**

**her shop**

After John’s death, Betsy decided to run

the tailor business on her own.

~~_Betsy Ross was an independent woman._~~

~~_What does independent mean?_~~ She took

great pride in her work and had become

well known throughout the colonies for her

tiny, even stitches and beautiful cloth. When men gathered in Philadelphia

for meetings, they often ordered clothing from Betsy for their families at

home. No order was too difficult for her. As war approached, Betsy was

asked to make flags for the Pennsylvania navy. The Continental Army,

led by General George Washington, flew one of her flags as well.


**Show Image 6A-5: Betsy Ross working in**

**her shop**

There is a famous legend about Betsy Ross.

~~_A legend is a story that has been told through_~~

~~_the years and may or may not be true._~~

According to this legend, Betsy sat in her

shop, sewing and enjoying the light of a warm

summer evening in June 1776, when she heard

a loud rapping at her door. John’s uncle, George Ross, stood before her with

two other men. One of them was General George Washington himself.


“Good evening, Madame,” he began. “We have an important job that needs

to be done very quickly. As your husband, John, was a Patriot, and you are

known to be the best tailor in the colonies, we feel that you are the right

person for the job.”


Unit 8 American Independence


“Do come in,” Betsy replied. “I will heat the kettle for tea, and you can explain

to me your business.”


“Thank you kindly, dear Betsy,” said George Ross, entering the house,

“but I am afraid we do not have time to sit down. As you may have heard,

the Continental Congress is meeting here in Philadelphia for a second time.

We are on our way to a meeting this very evening. Soon, quite soon, we will

formally declare our independence from Britain. We must be ready with a

new flag, for we will no longer want to fly the flag of the British king.”


**Show Image 6A-6: Design for the first flag**

Betsy stood still, listening to his words and

turning to General Washington who had taken

a scrap of paper from his coat pocket.


“Mrs. Ross,” General Washington, said, “this is

your chance to show your **patriotism**, ~~_or love_~~

~~_for your country_~~, as your late husband, John,

did. I have drawn a rough design sketch for the new flag. Please take a look

and let me know what you think. We would like for you to sew the first flag of

a new nation, thirteen colonies united against Great Britain.”


Betsy took the slip of paper from General Washington’s hand. On it was a

square drawing of thirteen stripes and thirteen stars. Betsy nodded her head

and then looked up into the general’s face. ~~_Why did the design have thirteen_~~

~~_stripes and thirteen stars?_~~


“Yes,” she smiled, “I accept. I will gladly make the flag. Might I offer just one

suggestion, sir?”


George Washington liked Betsy’s suggestion of a five-pointed star instead of

the six-pointed one that he had drawn. Then the three visitors turned and left

as quickly as they had come.



Support


In this sentence, the word
_slip_ means a small piece
of paper. The word _slip_
can also mean to lose your
balance, especially on a
slippery surface.



Lesson 6 The Legend of Betsy Ross
**87**


**88**



**Show Image 6A-7: Betsy Ross sewing the flag**

Betsy set to work on the flag the very next day.

Taking down a red bolt, ~~_or roll_~~, of cloth from

the shelf, she measured and cut seven strips

of equal length and width. Then she did the

same thing with a bolt of white cloth, this time

cutting six strips. She applied her famous even

stitches along the length of each strip—first

a red, and then a white—until thirteen stripes of **alternating** colors joined

together to form a large rectangle. Next, Betsy measured and cut a

square from a bolt of blue cloth and carefully stitched it into the upper

left-hand corner of the flag. Days later, when she had completely finished,

thirteen white stars almost twinkled in a perfect circle against the dark

blue background.


**Show Image 6A-8: Betsy Ross displaying the**

**completed flag**

When Betsy showed George Washington and

his fellow representatives the finished flag,

they were very pleased. They knew this flag

would **represent** the new country well. This

new flag stood as an important symbol to the

men who gathered under it on Independence

Day when they voted to approve their declaration of independence to King

George. One year later, in June 1777, the Continental Congress officially

adopted Betsy Ross’s flag, the “Stars and Stripes,” as the national flag of the

United States of America. ~~_“Stars and Stripes” is a name often used for the_~~

~~_flag of our country. Why do you think this name is used?_~~

the length of each strip—first a red, and then a white—until thirteen stripes
of alternating colors joined together to form a large rectangle.”


2. Say the word _alternating_ with me.


3. _Alternating_ means following one after another.


4. I love to eat my mother’s lasagna, which has alternating layers of cheese,
noodles, and sauce.


5. What other things have you seen or heard that have alternating items? Try to
use the word _alternating_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If
necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses: “I saw the,
which has alternating . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I am going to draw several
shapes on the board. If they are alternating, or following one after another,
taking turns, say, “Those are alternating.” If they are not alternating, but
are steady or not in a pattern, say, “Those are not alternating.” [Draw the
following shapes on the board.]


   - in a row: heart, circle, heart, circle _(Those are alternating.)_


   - forming a circle: square, circle, heart, circle, green dot

~~**MID-UNIT ASSESSMENT**~~


**Identifying Events Activity**


**Directions:** You will use Activity Page PP.1 to identify the events you have
been hearing about. You should recognize the images on the activity page as
smaller versions of some of the images you have used during the Sequencing
Events and Picture Gallery activities. You will identify these events by writing
the number on the line below each image to reflect the order in which I
describe them.


[Prior to students working independently on this assessment, you may wish
to review as a class what is depicted in each image.]


1. At the Second Continental Congress, this important document was signed,
which declared the colonies free from Britain. _(Declaration of Independence)_


2. According to legend, Betsy Ross sewed and helped design this at the request
of George Washington. _(Stars and Stripes)_


3. This group of early English settlers founded Plymouth. _(Pilgrims)_


4. These were established by the British in North America and include Georgia,
New York, New Jersey, and North Carolina. _(thirteen colonies)_


5. “The shot heard round the world” occurred when Minutemen and Redcoats
met in this battle. _(Lexington)_


6. The Sons of Liberty dressed up and dumped tea into the ocean during this
event. _(Boston Tea Party)_


7. This was a secret code that was shared by lantern from a church bell tower to
signal whether the British were traveling on foot or in a boat. _(“one, if by land,_
_and two, if by sea”)_

~~**ACTIVITIES**~~


**Picture Gallery**

 - Choose another image from the Flip Book for this unit and have students
write captions as they did in Lessons 2 and 5.


**Riddles for Core Content**

 - Ask students riddles such as the following to review core content:


   - I wrote the Declaration of Independence. Who am I? _(Thomas Jefferson)_


   - I wore a red uniform and fought against the colonists. Who am I? _(Redcoat)_


   - I rode a horse to warn the colonists that the Redcoats were coming.

Who am I? _(Paul Revere)_


   - Legend says that George Washington asked me to sew a flag for the

new nation. Who am I? _(Betsy Ross)_


   - I am the name for the flag of the United States. What am I?

_(Stars and Stripes)_


**On Stage: Boston Tea Party, Paul Revere’s Ride, Writing of the**
**Declaration of Independence, Legend of Betsy Ross**

 - Have a group of students plan and then act out the Boston Tea Party,

Paul Revere’s ride, the writing of the Declaration of Independence, or the
legend of Betsy Ross.


**“One, if by Land, and Two, if by Sea”**







You may wish to read at least the first two verses of Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow’s famous poem about Paul Revere’s ride and explain that it
is the origin of this well-known phrase about Paul Revere.



**“The Shot Heard Round the World”**

  - You may wish to explain that the origin of this well-known phrase is from

“Concord Hymn,” a poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson. You may wish to read
the first verse of this poem to students.


**Colonial Flag**


**Materials: Chart paper, drawing tools**

  - Have students work as a class, in groups, or individually to create a drawing

of the flag during colonial times. As students create, discuss what the stars
and stripes symbolize. You may also wish to have some students create a
current flag to compare and contrast the two.


Pausing Point

Flip Book 1A-10



**Thirteen Original Colonies**


**Materials: Map of the thirteen original colonies or Image 1A-10**

 - Help students locate and identify the thirteen original colonies on a map.
(You may use Flip Book Image 1A-10.)


 - Name each colony and ask students if they remember any events that
took place in that colony. You may prompt discussion by asking questions,
such as, “Where did the Boston Tea Party take place?” _(Massachusetts)_
or “Where did the Continental Congress meet?” _(Pennsylvania)_


**You Were There: Boston Tea Party, Paul Revere’s Ride,**
**Writing of the Declaration of Independence, Making the Flag**

 - Have students pretend that they were at one of the important events
related to our nation’s independence.


 - Ask students to describe what they saw and heard. For example, for

Paul Revere’s Ride, students may talk about seeing Paul Revere on his
horse, the signal being given with the lanterns, hearing Paul Revere
warning the colonists that the Redcoats were coming, etc.


 - Consider extending this activity by adding group or independent writing

opportunities associated with the “You Were There” concept. For example,
ask students to pretend they are newspaper reporters describing the
Boston Tea Party and write a group news article describing the events.


**Class Flag**


**Materials: Chart paper, drawing tools**

 - Review the legend of Betsy Ross and the design of the first flag.
Review George Washington’s idea for the first flag having thirteen
stripes and thirteen stars to represent the unified colonies.


 - Tell students that they are going to come up with a design for a classroom

flag. Have students brainstorm what unifies them as a class. Have them
think of symbols to show what unifies them as a class to put on their flag.
You may wish to have them draw their design on a large piece of chart paper.
Have students work as a class or in groups. Display the finished product(s)
in your classroom.


**Image Review**

  - Hold Image Cards 5–8 in your hand, fanned out like a deck of cards.

Ask a student to choose a card but not show it to anyone else in the class.
The student must then perform an action or give a clue about the picture
they are holding. For example, for the original flag, a student may pretend
to be Betsy Ross sewing the flag.


  - Have the rest of the class guess what event is being described.


  - Proceed to another card when the correct answer has been given.


**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**


Materials: Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard

  - Give students a key unit concept or vocabulary word, such as
_Declaration of Independence_ .


  - Have students brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear the
word, such as, “written by Thomas Jefferson, free from Great Britain,” etc.

Flip Book Poster 1M



**Multiple Meaning Word Activity**

 - Show Poster 1M (Stamps). Remind students that in the Read-Aloud they

heard, “The colonists were asked to pay extra for stamps, sugar, and other
things.” Tell students that here, _stamps_ means small pieces of paper you buy
to put on an envelope or package to pay the cost of mailing it. Have students
hold up one, two or three fingers to indicate which image on the poster shows
this meaning. _(1)_


 - Tell students that _stamps_ also has other meanings. The word _stamps_ can
mean objects used to mark something with a design. Have students hold
up one, two or three fingers to indicate which image on the poster shows
this meaning. _(2)_


 - Tell students that _stamps_ has another meaning as well. The word _stamps_

can mean to bring a foot down heavily and with a lot of noise. Have students
hold up one, two or three fingers to indicate which image on the poster shows
this meaning. _(3)_

**Show Image 7A-1: George Washington’s army**

You will remember that while representatives

to the Second Continental Congress met

and signed the Declaration of Independence,

George Washington was far away from

Philadelphia. ~~_What was the Declaration of_~~

~~_Independence?_~~ He was sent north to Boston

to fight the British. His was a very difficult

job. Washington’s **army** was made up mostly of farmers with no military

experience at all; they had no uniforms and only old guns, called muskets,

which they hardly knew how to fire. There weren’t enough guns, and there

was hardly any gunpowder.


The wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved on July 4,

1776. Five days later, messengers carrying copies of the declaration reached

New York, where General Washington’s army was camped. His army heard

the words and rallied in support of independence. ~~_How do you think the army_~~

~~_felt when they heard the declaration?_~~

Unit 8 American Independence


**Show Image 7A-2: British warships in**

**New York Harbor**

The men soon realized that they didn’t have

enough supplies for the fight ahead. Later

that summer, British warships were spotted

entering New York’s harbor. King George

had gotten help from the Germans as well.

~~_Germans are people who are from Germany,_~~

~~_another country on the continent of Europe. Show students its location on_~~

~~_a world map._~~ More than thirty thousand trained troops arrived to fight the

unprepared colonial militiamen.


George Washington nearly lost his army in the fierce fighting around

New York and New Jersey that fall. The Redcoats chased the Continental

Army south, across the Delaware River. Thinking that they had scared them

off, the Redcoats left only a small force to guard them on the other side of

the river. It was December, and they felt sure that nobody would fight during

the dead of winter. But they were wrong. ~~_What do you think the colonists did?_~~


**Show Image 7A-3:** _**Washington Crossing**_

_**the Delaware**_

George Washington came up with a **daring**

plan. ~~_Daring means courageous._~~ On Christmas

night, he gathered his men together. It was

snowing and cold, but Washington had the

men get into their boats and row quietly

across the ice-filled river. More than two

thousand soldiers crossed the river. The crossings took several hours.

Marching through the wind and sleet of the December cold, the Continental

Army reached the British troops just before dawn. While the Redcoats

were still sleeping, Washington’s men launched a surprise attack on the

enemy camp.


The Redcoats were surprised all right! Some of them came out of their bunks

in their underwear and just held up their hands. It was a total victory for

General Washington. Washington and his army returned to Philadelphia to

shouts of joy. But the war wasn’t over yet.



Support


In the _Astronomy_ unit, you
learned that _launch_ means
to lift or push an object
forcefully. In this sentence,
_launch_ is similar to _start_ .


Challenge


What do you think would
have happened if George
Washington did not launch
the surprise attack?



Lesson 7 George Washington, Commander in Chief
**105**


Support


Tell students that the
phrase “keeping up one’s
spirits” means to keep
a positive attitude when
things are challenging.
Explain that is a common
phrase that they will see
again in the next lesson.


**106**



**Show Image 7A-4: Benjamin Franklin**

**in France**

The Continental Congress knew that they

needed more help in order to win their war for

independence. German soldiers were fighting

alongside the British. Perhaps the French

would send soldiers across the ocean to help

the colonists fight against the British. It was

no secret that the French and British had long been enemies. ~~_The French_~~

~~_are people who are from France, another country on the continent of Europe._~~

~~_[Show students its location on a world map.]_~~ The Continental Congress

decided to send some men to France to ask for their support. Their chief

representative was seventy-year-old Benjamin Franklin. ~~_Who was_~~

~~_Benjamin Franklin?_~~


The French did not like to lose in battle, and they were still angry about

losing to the British in an earlier war. At first, they did not want to support

the colonists. It was crazy to think that an army of farmers could **defeat** one

of the greatest armies in the world, the British army. ~~_If you defeat someone,_~~

~~_you win._~~ But an American victory in New York in the fall of 1777 changed their

opinion overnight. They promised gunpowder, soldiers, and ships.


**Show Image 7A-5: Valley Forge**

General Washington’s army was camped in

Pennsylvania at a place called Valley Forge

during the winter of 1777 and 1778. Snow

lay on the ground when Washington and his

men arrived. They pitched tents and built log

cabins, but neither kept out the cold. The men

were dressed in rags, and many of them had

no shoes, walking barefoot in the snow. There was hardly any food, and some

days the men had little to eat and drink other than bread and water. Disease

spread through the camp, and many men died. The men missed their families

and wanted to go home. Washington **struggled** to keep up his men’s spirits.

~~_Washington worked very hard to keep his men from quitting._~~ He camped in a

tent beside them for a time, earning their respect. No battles were fought at

Valley Forge that winter, but the cold and hungry men spent hours training to

be ready when they met the British again in the spring.


Unit 8 American Independence


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


Check for Understanding


**Think of a Word:** Think of what you heard today about
George Washington as commander in chief. [Pause.]
Think of one word that describes him or his actions.

[Ask several students to share.] _(Answers will vary but_
_may include_ brave _,_ leader _,_ strong _, etc.)_


1. **Inferential.** How would you describe George Washington’s army?
( _They had no military experience and few supplies._ )


2. **Inferential.** Think-Pair-Share: Why were George Washington and his army
willing to fight the Redcoats? ( _Answers may vary._ )


3. **Literal.** What happened on Christmas day in 1776? _(George Washington and_

_his men rowed across the Delaware River and launched a surprise attack on_
_the British. It was a victory.)_


4. **Who-Pair-Share:** Asking questions after a Read-Aloud is one way to see how

much everyone has learned. Think of a question you can ask your neighbor
about the Read-Aloud that starts with the word _who_ . For example, you could
ask, “Who did you hear about in today’s Read-Aloud?” Turn to your neighbor
and ask your _who_ question. Listen to your neighbor’s response. Then your
neighbor will ask a new _who_ question, and you will get a chance to respond.
I will call on several of you to share your questions with the class.


Lesson 7 George Washington, Commander in Chief
**107**


**108**



~~**WORD WORK: STRUGGLED (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Washington struggled to keep up his
men’s spirits.” Remind students that “to keep up his men’s spirits” means to
keep his men feeling positive.


2. Say the word _struggled_ with me.


3. _Struggled_ means had difficulty and worked very hard to accomplish something.


4. I struggled to get up the steps with the heavy box.


5. Have you ever struggled with a task? Try to use the word _struggled_ when you
tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase
the students’ responses: “I struggled with . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Discussion activity for follow-up.** I will ask a question. Be sure to use
the word _struggled_ in your answer. ( _Answers may vary for all._ )


   - Have you ever struggled to get out of bed in the morning?


   - Have you ever struggled with cleaning your room?


   - Have you ever struggled to find something?


   - Have you ever struggled to wait your turn?

~~**“WILL THIS WAR NEVER END?” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 8A-1: Map of thirteen colonies**

By the spring of 1778, General Washington

and his Continental Army at Valley Forge were

in much better spirits. Soldiers and supplies

had arrived from France, the army was better

prepared, and the bitterly cold weather was

behind them. They were ready to take on the

British once more.


Fighting continued all across the colonies, on land and on sea, and into the

**wilderness** west of the Mississippi River. ~~_[Point to the map of the colonies,_~~

~~_designating where the wilderness lies to the west of the original colonies._~~

~~_Stress the extent of the fighting up and down the coast.]_~~ “Will this war never

end?” people wondered. “Is it worth the loss of so many lives?” The war

was shifting south now, and the British, under the command of General

Cornwallis, felt **confident** that they could defeat the colonial militia at

long last. ~~_Confident means certain._~~ ~~_Why do you think that the British felt so_~~

~~_confident, or sure, that they could win the war?_~~ Indeed, the British won quite

a few battles in the South. Little did they know that their successes were

about to end.


**TEKS 1.6.G** Evaluate details to determine what is most important with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and texts
the student is able to read or hear to learn or clarify word meanings.


Unit 8 American Independence


**Show Image 8A-2: James Armistead**

The British Army and General Cornwallis

believed they had a stronger army than the

colonists, and they also believed they had better

intelligence, or information, about their enemy’s

movements and strategy. However, American

spies were working inside the British camp! One

example is James Armistead. He posed as an

escaped slave in order to gain entry to General Cornwallis’s Virginia base. The

British welcomed him, but James Armistead was spying on British troop

movements and reporting them back to the Continental Army. Other African

Americans followed in Armistead’s footsteps and spied for the Continental Army

too, like a man named Saul Matthews. The information that James Armistead and

Saul Matthews gathered gave the Continental Army an upper hand in the war.


**Show Image 8A-3: Map of Virginia with**

**Yorktown noted**

In 1781, six long years after the first shot of the

war was fired in Lexington, Massachusetts, ~~_or_~~

~~_“the shot heard round the world,”_~~ things began to

look promising for the Continental Army. George

Washington received news that twenty-eight

French ships were on their way to the coast of

Yorktown, Virginia, where General Cornwallis and the Redcoats were camped. He

was very excited. George Washington came up with a plan to trap the British. ~~_How_~~

~~_do you think the French ships could help Washington and his army trap the British?_~~


General Washington’s troops, now camped in New York, marched all day and

often through the night to Yorktown, Virginia, a town built on the banks of the

York River, just a little inland from the Atlantic Ocean. While Washington moved

his troops over land, French ships moved in by sea. The British couldn’t escape

by land because the Continental Army was blocking them, and they couldn’t

escape by sea because the French ships were blocking them there. George

Washington and his forces had the British blocked from both sides.


**Show Image 8A-4: Surrender at Yorktown**

British drummer boys waved a white flag to

show they were **surrendering**, and bands

are rumored to have played a tune called

“The World Turned Upside Down.” ~~_The word_~~

~~surrendering~~ ~~_means giving up._~~ ~~_The British_~~

~~_knew that they had lost the war._~~

Show students an image

Lesson 8 Will This War Never End?

Challenge


Why do you think
Benjamin Franklin was

sent to sign the peace

agreement? _(Answers_

_may vary.)_



It must surely have seemed like an upside-down world to the British, who

were used to winning wars and ruling colonies. Now they had lost a war.

They would no longer rule over the American colonies. The British army was

captured at Yorktown, and all the fighting in the colonies soon ended. The

British sailed home, and George Washington stepped down as commander in

chief of the Continental Army.


**Show Image 8A-5: Peace treaty** ~~_The colonists_~~
~~_and the British had to agree to peace—to no_~~
~~_more fighting. Representatives from both sides_~~
~~_met in France to work out an agreement._~~

It took two years of meetings in Paris, France,

to plan for peace. In 1783, Benjamin Franklin

was there to sign the peace agreement

that gave the American colonies their

independence. ~~_Who was Benjamin Franklin?_~~ They were finally free of British

rule. They would no longer have to pay taxes to the British king. Their new

nation reached from Canada in the North, to Florida in the South, to the

Mississippi River in the West. ~~_[Point to this territory on a U.S. map.]_~~


Now that the British were no longer in charge, and the colonists did not have to

obey the rules of a distant, ~~_or faraway_~~, king, who would rule the new nation? ~~_The_~~

~~_term_~~ ~~in charge~~ ~~_here means to have the responsibility of watching over something._~~

Some suggested that George Washington be made king. “King?” he scoffed.

“We have been fighting to rid ourselves of a king. Our new government must be

one where the people rule.” But how? ~~_Why do you think George Washington did_~~

~~_not want a king to be the leader of their new government?_~~


**Show Image 8A-6: Mount Vernon**

George Washington, exhausted by six years

of battle, wanted only to go back to his family.

He loved Mount Vernon, his home on the

Potomac River in Virginia. He dreamed of

being able to ride peacefully about his farm,

listening to birdsong instead of shouting out

orders to his men. Washington’s wife, Martha,

had been a great help to him during the war, bringing food and clothing to

his troops during their long, hard winters, and even camping out with them in

their field tents. She, too, looked forward to spending time with her husband

in the comfort of Mount Vernon. But George Washington was not able to relax

on his farm for too long, as you will soon learn.

_come up with a better plan of government._ )


5. **Evaluative.** Think-Pair-Share: In the beginning of the Read-Aloud, you heard

that some people questioned whether the war was worthwhile. How do you
think they felt at the end of the war? _(Answers will vary.)_

~~**WORD WORK: CONFIDENT (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In today’s Read-Aloud you heard, “[T]he British . . . felt confident that
they could defeat [General Washington and his men] at long last.”


2. Say the word _confident_ with me.


3. _Confident_ means that you are sure or certain about something,
having no doubts.


4. I am confident that Tuesday is the day after Monday. There is no doubt
in my mind.


5. Tell me something that you are confident about, perhaps something that

you know you do well. Try to use the word _confident_ when you tell about it.

[Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’
responses: “I am confident that . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I am going to read some

###### Application


**Language:** Students will practice using action words in the past and present.


~~**TEKS 1.3.C; TEKS 1.3.D; TEKS 1.11.D.ii**~~


~~**SYNTACTIC AWARENESS ACTIVITY (10 MIN.)**~~


**Action Words in the Past and Present**

  - Tell students they will listen carefully to action words, or verbs, and how they
change based on when the action is done.


  - Emphasize the bold words and the word parts as you read. Tell students in

the Read-Aloud today they heard the following:


_“Will this war never end?” people_ **wondered** _._


  - Tell students to notice that in the Read-Aloud, the action word _wondered_
tells us that this action took place in the past. This is true because the
Revolutionary War happened a very long time ago.


  - Remind students that we add _–ed_ to action words to show that the action
happened in the past.


  - Emphasize the bold words and the word parts as you read. Tell students you
are going to read some sentences that describe actions that are happening in
the present, or right now. When an action happens in the present, we do not
add _–ed_ to the action word. When students hear the action word, ask them
to point at their feet because the action is happening in the present, or right
now. Call on someone to tell which word is the action word.

    - They **play** in the gym. _(_ Play _is the action word.)_

    - They **work** outside in the garden. _(_ Work _is the action word.)_

    - They **move** quietly down the hall. _(_ Move _is the action word.)_

    - They **dance** joyfully around the classroom. _(_ Dance _is the action word.)_







With a partner, have students use the words _obey_, _surrender_, and _want_ from

the Read-Aloud to make sentences about things that happened in the past
and the present. Remind students to add _–ed_ to each word that is an action
that happened in the past.




  - Call on two or three partner pairs to share their sentences.


**TEKS 1.3.C** Identify the meaning of words with the affixes -s, -ed, and -ing; **TEKS 1.3.D** Identify and use words that name
actions, directions, positions, sequences, categories, and locations; **TEKS 1.11.D.ii** Edit drafts using conventions of standard
English past and present verb tense.


Lesson 8 Will This War Never End?

Check for Understanding


**Point at It:** Point to your feet if the action happens in the present.
Point behind you if the action happens in the past.


      - The colonists wondered if they would win the war. _(past/behind)_


      - The children play with a new toy. _(present/feet)_


      - The fish move quickly in the water. _(present/feet)_


     - The woman worked hard on the new design. _(past/behind)_


~~**SENTENCE WRITING (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that they are going to write sentences with their own action
words, or verbs, in both the past and present.


 - Remind students that the words _play_, _work_, _move_, and _dance_ (from the
previous activity) are all action words. Write these words on chart paper
or the board. Tell students that we are going to add several more words to
our action word list. Model thinking of another action word, and add _jump_
to the list. Encourage students to think of other action words and add their
suggestions to the list.


   - If students offer words that have an irregular past tense form (such as

run–ran or take–took), take the opportunity to discuss that some action
words don’t follow the pattern of adding _–ed_ . Explain that these are not
regular action verbs and that they often have unique ways of showing past
tense.


 - Model selecting one word from the list to write two sentences with—one
using the word in the present and one using the word in the past. Remind
students as you write that sentences must have a noun (or pronoun) to make
a complete sentence.


 - Write the following example sentence on the board or chart paper: The

dog jumps on the couch. Ask the following question: “Is this a complete
sentence?” _(Yes, because it has a noun and action word, or verb.)_ Ask
students, “Is this sentence showing present or past?” _(present)_


Unit 8 American Independence


  - Ask students what they notice about the action word in that sentence. _(It has_

_an –s on the end)_ . Explain that sometimes an _–s_ or _–es_ must be added to an
action word, or verb, in order for it to sound right. Tell students that they will
learn more about this in the future and that, for now, they will just listen for
what sounds right.


    - Point out some other words on the action word list that need to have an

_–s_ or _–es_ added to them. Use a few of these words in sentences, so that
students can hear additional examples.


  - Refer back to the original example sentence: The dog jumps on the couch.

Ask the following question: “How can we make this sentence show the past?
Remind students that they need to add an –ed to the action word. Write the
new sentence on chart paper or the board: The dog jumped on the couch.


  - With a partner, have students select three action words from the class list to
use in making past and present sentences. Remind students to listen to their
action words in the present to make sure they sound right and to add an _–s_
or _–es_ if they do not. Remind students to add an _–ed_ to their action words in
the past.


  - Circulate around to assist students, give feedback, and provide support as
students are working.


  - Call on two or three partner pairs to share their sentences.

~~**“A YOUNG NATION IS BORN” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 9A-1: Arguing states**

For the first few years after the Revolutionary

War ended, the former British colonies could

not seem to agree on anything. They had not

yet come up with a name for themselves.

Some said they should be called “The Union of

States,” while others liked the sound of “The

American Nation.” Others simply wanted to

call themselves by the names of the states in which they lived—Virginians, if

they lived in Virginia; New Yorkers, if they lived in New York; and so on. There

was no plan for how they would be governed, or ruled, so lots of different

people were making up lots of different rules. States were taxing one another

unfairly, just like the British had done before the war. What a big mess!


**Show Image 9A-2: George Washington at**

**Mount Vernon**

George Washington was enjoying life at

Mount Vernon with his wife, their children,

and grandchildren. At fifty-five, he felt he had

served his country well as a commander in

chief, and he was not looking for any more

jobs away from his farm. But four years after

returning home from the revolution, Washington was called to Philadelphia,

Pennsylvania, for another big meeting.


**TEKS 1.6.G** Evaluate details to determine what is most important with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and texts
the student is able to read or hear to learn or clarify word meanings.


Unit 8 American Independence


**Show Image 9A-3: Washington, Franklin,**
**and Jefferson** ~~_Do you recognize anyone in_~~
~~_these pictures?_~~

He joined many of the same men with whom

he had worked in the Continental Congress at

the beginning of the war. These men are called

our Founding Fathers, or simply Founders,

because they helped found, or start, our

new country. Benjamin Franklin, now eighty-one years old, was the oldest

representative there.


George Washington was elected **president** of the convention, or meeting.

~~_A president is the person in charge of a large meeting or country._~~ It was called

the Constitutional Convention because the men were writing a constitution, a

plan for how the new nation could live together peacefully. ~~_Do you remember_~~

~~_how Washington said that they needed to come up with a plan of how to rule_~~

~~_the country without a king? Well, these men were meeting to come up with_~~

~~_that plan, which they called the Constitution._~~


**Show Image 9A-4: Constitutional Convention**

“Stop arguing,” George Washington told the

men. “We have an important job to do.” It was

hard work. They met for four long, hot months,

from May to September. The men continued

to argue. Some walked out. But most of them

stayed until they came up with a good plan,

or constitution. Their hard work paid off. The

rules they wrote that summer, more than two hundred years ago, are the

ones we still use today. And when our Founding Fathers left Philadelphia that

September, our country had a new name.


**Show Image 9A-5: United States**

“We, the people of the **United** States . . .,”

they wrote. ~~_United means combined into one._~~

~~_So now all the states have come together; they_~~

~~_are a united, or single, nation._~~ The thirteen

former British colonies had become the United

States of America.


Lesson 9 A Young Nation Is Born
**131**


**132**



One thing the representatives discussed that summer was their need for a

leader. They decided that a president, chosen by the people to serve for only

a few years, would be better than a king who was not elected and served

for his entire lifetime. And guess who they wanted to lead them?

~~_[Pause for student responses.]_~~


**Show Image 9A-6:**

**President George Washington**

You guessed it: George Washington!

Once again, he had wanted to settle down at

Mount Vernon, but once again, he had been

called to serve his country.


In 1789, when George Washington left his home

in Virginia to become the first president of

the United States of America, he had no idea what he was going to do. As the

president of the new country, he knew that his presidency would set an example

for all future presidents. While president, Washington stayed very busy. He

helped organize a **permanent** national army and navy and set up a national

banking system. ~~_If something is permanent, it means that it is lasting; it will not_~~

~~_go away. Today, our country still has a permanent national army and navy._~~


As president, George Washington lived first in New York City, our nation’s

first capital, and later moved along with the capital to Philadelphia.


**Show Image 9A-7: Washington, D.C., today**

He worked hard on plans for a city that would

be our nation’s permanent **capital** . George

Washington personally chose the capital’s

site along the Potomac River, on land that is

between Maryland and Virginia. ~~_A capital city_~~

~~_is the city where leaders gather to govern the_~~

~~_entire country. The word_~~ ~~capital~~ ~~_can also mean_~~

~~_an uppercase letter. [Explain that this image shows Washington, D.C., as it_~~

~~_looks today.]_~~ This capital city would not be in any state, so no state could say

that it was in charge of the country. The capital city was designed to have

a house in which the president and his family would live. It would also have

many government buildings. George Washington was no longer president

when the capital city was finally built, but the city was named in his honor. It

was called Washington, D.C. ~~_D.C. stands for District of Columbia._~~


Unit 8 American Independence


**Show Image 9A-8:**

**George Washington’s legacy**

After serving as president of the United States

for eight years, George Washington packed up

and headed home to Virginia. He died at Mount

Vernon at the end of 1799, about two and half

years later. A Patriot, a Founder of our nation,

a military commander, and our first president,

Washington has rightly been called the “Father of Our Country.” Many places

have been named for him. Monuments and statues have been built in his

honor. You can even find his picture on our money, both on a paper bill and on

a coin. ~~_George Washington’s picture is on the one-dollar bill and the quarter._~~


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What did George Washington do after the war ended? ( _retired,_
_president of Constitutional Convention, first president of the United States_ )


Check for Understanding


**Recall:** The Read-Aloud tells us that George Washington was
a founder, or Founding Father, of our country. What did these
founders do? ( _They helped write the new rules for our country_
_to live by, called the Constitution._ )


2. **Evaluative.** If Washington loved Mount Vernon so much, why do you think he
left again, first going to Philadelphia for another meeting, and then becoming
president of the country? ( _He fought for independence for many years, and_
_he realized that his job was not over yet. He knew that his help was needed in_
_“founding” the new nation._ )


3. **Inferential.** Why do you think Washington felt it was important to have a
permanent, or lasting, army and navy? ( _He had learned firsthand how difficult_
_it was to fight a war with untrained men and wanted to be prepared_
_in the event of another war._ )

 - Emphasize the bold words and the word parts as you read.
Remind students that in the Read-Aloud today they heard:


_From then on, the thirteen colonies were_ **called** _the_
_United States of America._


 - Prompt students to notice that in the Read-Aloud, the action word _called_
is an action that took place in the past. This is true because the thirteen
colonies have been called the United States for a long time.


 - Remind students that we add _–ed_ to action words to show that the action
happened in the past, but we do not add the ending to action words that
describe things that happen in the present.


 - Read some sentences that describe actions in the future, emphasizing the
words in bold. When an action happens in the future, tell students the word
will appears before the action word. When students hear the action word,
ask them to point in front of them because the action will happen at a
future time. Call on someone to tell which words are the action words.


   - Later, we **will play** in the gym. _(_ Will play _are the action words.)_

**“NEVER LEAVE UNTIL TOMORROW**

**WHAT YOU CAN DO TODAY” (15 MIN.)**


**Show Image 10A-1: Benjamin Franklin**

Like George Washington, Benjamin Franklin

was one of the Founding Fathers of our

country. He was never a president, but he

was a very wise man with wonderful ideas.

~~_Benjamin Franklin was wise because he used_~~

~~_his intelligence to make good choices and do_~~

~~_clever things._~~ You will remember that Franklin

was a part of the Continental Congress, a signer of the Declaration of

Independence, and a representative of our country in both Great Britain

and France. He was all over the place!

Unit 8 American Independence


**Show Image 10A-2: Franklin in his printing**

**shop**

Long before his days in government, Benjamin

Franklin was a successful businessman in

Philadelphia. He had always been a good

reader and writer, and as a boy he had been

an **apprentice** in his brother’s printing shop

in Boston. ~~_An apprentice is someone who is_~~

~~_learning how to do a job from someone who is an expert at that job._~~

So, when he moved to Philadelphia, Franklin set up his own printing

shop and started his own newspaper, eventually becoming the busiest

printer in the American colonies.


**Show Image 10A-3:** _**Poor Richard’s Almanack**_

For more than twenty-five years, Benjamin

Franklin published a series of books called

_Poor Richard’s Almanack_ . ~~_[Benjamin Franklin_~~

~~_spelled his almanac the old-fashioned way,_~~

~~_with a “ck.” Today, most people spell almanac_~~

~~_with just a “c.”]_~~ His **almanac** was often the

only book that people bought. It contained

lots of practical information that they wanted to know. For example, the

almanac had a calendar with the times of the sunrise and sunset. Today, we

check the weather forecasts on television, the internet, or on an app, but

back then, people looked in their almanacs to find out what the weather

would be like. The almanac had stories and poems as well as puzzles, jokes,

and lots of advice. Franklin included many wise sayings, many of which we

still use today. Have you ever heard anyone say, “Never leave until tomorrow

what you can do today”? What do you think that means? ~~_[Pause for student_~~

~~_responses.]_~~ Franklin must have lived by his own words because he got so

much done! He was never still for a minute. His brain was working constantly,

spilling over with questions and ideas.


**Show Image 10A-4: Child inventor**

Benjamin Franklin had a keen interest in

science and the way things work. As a young

boy in Boston, Benjamin spent much of his

time swimming in the harbor. ~~_What else have_~~

Show students a copy of
_The Old Farmer’s Almanac_,
real swim fins, a rocking
chair, bifocals, a key
and kite to bring some
of Benjamin Franklin’s
inventions to life.



Lesson 10 Never Leave Until Tomorrow What You Can Do Today
**143**


**144**



~~_you learned about that happened in Boston Harbor?_~~ He was pretty good, but

he wanted to be even better and faster. One day he thought of a way that he

could be a faster swimmer. He found some wood and carved some wooden

paddles to fit over his hands and feet, kind of like the flippers that divers use

today. When he swam with those, he was much faster, probably faster than

all the other children his age.


**Show Image 10A-5: 18th-century bifocals**

As Benjamin Franklin grew older, he continued

to invent new things. Anytime he saw a

problem, he tried to invent a way to fix it. He

had two pairs of glasses, one for reading and

one to help him see things far away. He didn’t

like having to switch glasses all day long, so he

asked a glass cutter to slice all of his lenses in

half. He made one new pair of glasses, with the distance lenses on top and

the close-up lenses on the bottom. Franklin had just invented bifocal glasses,

still worn by many people today.


**Show Image 10A-6: Iron stove**

While sitting by the fire one night, Benjamin

Franklin watched warm air disappearing up

the chimney and wondered how he could trap

more warm air inside the house. He made

a wood-burning stove out of iron. ~~_[Explain_~~

~~_to students that Franklin’s stove was similar_~~

~~_to this iron stove.]_~~ It put out twice as much

heat as a regular fireplace and burned less wood. This stove was named the

Franklin stove, after its inventor.


**Show Image 10A-7: Franklin and the kite**

Lightning was another thing that fascinated

Benjamin Franklin. He had watched houses

and barns burn to the ground when struck

by lightning. Could it be, he wondered, that

lightning was electricity? He was going to find

out. A legend about Franklin’s experiment with

a kite during a lightning storm goes like this:

~~_[Before reading the legend, ask students if they remember what a legend is.]_~~


Unit 8 American Independence


One day, Franklin took his son William out in the middle of a thunderstorm,

with lightning raging all around them. He tied a little metal key near the end

of the string of a kite. ~~_[Point to the key near Franklin’s hand and to the string_~~

~~_that extends from it. Explain that the kite is at the other end of the string, just_~~

~~_outside the picture. Emphasize to students that this was a very dangerous_~~

~~_thing for Ben Franklin to do, and he was extremely lucky not to have gotten_~~

~~_hurt during this experiment.]_~~ Franklin was pretty sure that if lightning was

electricity, flying the kite in the thunderstorm would cause the key to become

charged with electricity. He kept touching the key as the kite flew above their

heads. As fibers on the kite string stood on end, Franklin felt a little shock. He

was right! Lightning was electricity! Franklin used his discovery to invent the

lightning rod, a pole that helps carry electricity away from buildings and into

the ground. His **invention**, ~~_or creation_~~, is used today to prevent fires caused

by lightning strikes.


**Show Image 10A-8: Wooden rocking chair**

Benjamin Franklin’s list of inventions goes

on and on. The next time you rock back and

forth in a rocking chair, thank Franklin for

helping you to relax. This clever man invented

a rocking chair with a fan to help people keep

cool while they rocked.


**Show Image 10A-9: Flag at half-mast**

In 1790, just three years after the Constitution

was written for our country, Benjamin Franklin

died peacefully in his sleep at the age of

eighty-four. Twenty thousand people attended

his funeral, at the time the biggest funeral

ever held in Philadelphia. Bells rang and flags

flew at half-staff as signs of respect for one of

America’s greatest heroes. ~~_If you look at the picture, you will see a flag flying_~~

~~_at half-mast, or halfway up the flagpole._~~

The word _strikes_ in this
sentence means the
flashes of light that are
produced in the sky
during a storm. The word
_strikes_ can also mean hits
something with force,
such as a drum.

**145**


**146**



~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What did Benjamin Franklin do at his brother’s print shop? ( _Franklin_
_practiced as an apprentice._ )

   - **Literal.** Name one thing that Benjamin Franklin wrote.
( _Poor Richard’s Almanack_ )


   - **Evaluative.** If you were an apprentice learning how to do something,
with whom would you want to apprentice? ( _Answers may vary._ )


2. **Literal.** What are some of the things that Benjamin Franklin invented? [Note:
You may want to show Flip Book images from today’s Read-Aloud to prompt
responses. Allow several students to respond.] ( _wooden swimming flippers,_
_bifocals, Franklin stove, lightning rod, rocking chair with fan_ )


3. **What? Pair-Share:** Asking questions after a Read-Aloud is one way to
see how much everyone has learned. Think of a question you can ask your
neighbor about the Read-Aloud that starts with the word _what_ . For example,
you could ask, “What would you like to invent?” Turn to your neighbor and ask
your _what_ question. Listen to your neighbor’s response. Then your neighbor
will ask a new _what_ question, and you will get a chance to respond. I will call
on several of you to share your questions with the class.

~~**WORD WORK: ALMANAC (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “[Benjamin Franklin’s] almanac was often

the only book people bought.”


2. Say the word _almanac_ with me.


3. An _almanac_ is a yearly publication that includes a calendar and other

helpful information.


4. My mother always checks the almanac to see if winter will last long this year.


5. As you learned in the Read-Aloud, people used almanacs to find out

important and practical information like times for sunrise and sunset, what
the weather would be like, and wise sayings. Think about whether you would
use an almanac today. Try to use the word _almanac_ when you tell about it.

[Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’
responses: “I would/would not use an almanac today because . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Drawing activity for follow-up.** What might you use an almanac
to do if you lived during Benjamin Franklin’s time? Draw a picture showing
something you might use an almanac to do, and then write a sentence about
it. Be sure to use the word _almanac_ in your sentence.

author of the Declaration of Independence, he is also remembered
for other reasons. Tell students to listen carefully to learn about
Thomas Jefferson’s contributions.


~~**“BUILDING A NATION WITH WORDS AND IDEAS” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 11A-1: Thomas Jefferson**

Benjamin Franklin enjoyed the company of

another Patriot, Thomas Jefferson from Virginia.

Jefferson was often the youngest person in the

room when the Founders met in Philadelphia,

whereas Franklin was often the oldest.


Like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson

was always ready to serve his country, but the

place he most liked to be was at home with his family. ~~_What saying did you_~~

~~_learn that Jefferson might have used in talking about his home?_~~ ~~_(“There’s no_~~

~~_place like home.”)_~~


**Show Image 11A-2: Monticello**
~~_This is Jefferson’s home, his favorite place_~~

~~_to spend time._~~

When Thomas Jefferson was a young lawyer,

he started building a house close to the farm

where he grew up in Virginia. Built on a hill,

he named it Monticello [/mon*tee*chel*oe/],

which means “little mountain” in Italian.

Challenge


What inventions can you
think of, or imagine, that
would make life easier?


**158**



He worked on it for many years—before, during, and after the war.

~~_This image shows present-day Monticello._~~ Jefferson traveled in Europe and

brought back many ideas from France and Italy. Because of Monticello and

some other buildings he designed, Jefferson is called the father of American

**architecture** . ~~_Architecture refers to the design of buildings, or the way that_~~

~~_buildings look._~~ In fact, Jefferson was one of the people who worked on the

design of Washington, D.C., our nation’s capital.


Like Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson liked to invent things. For his

house, he invented a pulley system that opened doors, and a mechanical

clock that kept track of the days of the week.


He also invented a dumbwaiter, a shelf that could be piled high with food

dishes, raised from the kitchen downstairs up to the dining room, then

lowered back down with empty dishes when the meal was over.


**Show Image 11A-3: Jefferson’s copy machine**

Thomas Jefferson was one of the most

important writers in the colonies. Remember,

he was the author of the Declaration of

Independence. Because he wrote so many

important papers and letters, he wanted to

be able to make copies of them for himself.

So, Jefferson bought a copy machine from

his friend, Charles Wilson Peale. It was one of the first copy machines ever

made. As Jefferson wrote at his desk, a second pen was automatically

writing the same thing right beside him. ~~_[Point to the picture, and explain that_~~

~~_Jefferson could write a letter and hand you a second copy right away, without_~~

~~_even going to a copy machine. Explain to students that this is a picture of a_~~

~~_modern-day version of Jefferson’s invention, and his would not have used_~~

~~_writing tools like the pencils in this image.]_~~ So he could continue his work

away from home, Thomas Jefferson invented a lap desk that he could carry

with him on horseback that could hold all of his paperwork and office tools.

~~_This is similar to carrying a backpack or using a laptop computer._~~


After the Constitutional Convention and the election of George Washington

as the country’s first president, Thomas Jefferson returned to Virginia

to work on Monticello. When he was not at Monticello, often he was off

representing his country, sharing his ideas both in America and in Europe.


Unit 8 American Independence


**Show Image 11A-4: Presidents Washington,**

**Adams, and Jefferson**

George Washington served as president of

the United States for eight years. When he

retired to Mount Vernon, another one of the

Founding Fathers named John Adams took his

place, becoming America’s second president.

Thomas Jefferson became John Adams’ vice

president. ~~_A vice president is someone who is second in command to the_~~

~~_president._~~ Four years later, Thomas Jefferson became our nation’s third

president. In the eight years that he was president, he did many things to

help the young nation grow.


**Show Image 11A-5: University of Virginia**

One of the things that Thomas Jefferson

believed in most was public education. He

realized how fortunate he had been, having the

chance to attend excellent schools all his life,

but he knew that not everybody could afford

to do so. Perhaps Jefferson’s greatest project

was planning for a public college in his state

of Virginia. ~~_A public school is one that is funded or paid for with the people’s_~~

~~_tax money._~~ ~~_A college, or university, is a place to continue studying after high_~~

~~_school._~~ He designed the buildings, chose the subjects to be taught, and

raised money to build the **University** of Virginia. The university was built on a

friend’s farm just down the hill from Monticello so that Jefferson could watch

it being built. ~~_[Point to the picture and ask students if they notice anything_~~

~~_similar about this building and Monticello.]_~~


**Show Image 11A-6:**

**President Thomas Jefferson**

Thomas Jefferson died on the afternoon

of July 4, 1826, just hours before the death

of his friend John Adams. The second and

third presidents of the United States of

America died on the fiftieth **anniversary**

of Independence Day. ~~_An anniversary is_~~

~~_celebrated every year, like your birthday._~~ ~~_Your birthday is the anniversary of_~~

~~_your birth. So,_~~ ~~_Jefferson died fifty years to the day after the signing of the_~~

~~_Declaration of Independence._~~

1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “The second and third presidents of
the United States of America died on the fiftieth anniversary of
Independence Day.”


2. Say the word _anniversary_ with me.


3. An _anniversary_ is an important date that you remember on the
same day each year.


4. My parents went out to dinner last night to celebrate their
wedding anniversary.


5. Think of an anniversary, a date that you or a friend remember in some way
every year on the same day. Try to use the word _anniversary_ when you tell
about it. For example, you might say, “Today is the second anniversary of the
day we got our dog.” That means that you got your dog two years ago on this
same day. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase
the students’ responses: “I celebrate the anniversary of . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Discussion activity for follow-up.** Most anniversaries are celebrated
by only a few people for whom the anniversary is important, but the
anniversary of our country’s birth, Independence Day, is celebrated by
people all across the nation. How do you celebrate this anniversary? [After
the discussion, ask students to write a sentence telling about how they
celebrate either Independence Day or another important anniversary
in their lives. Tell them to be sure to use the word _anniversary_ in their
sentence. Some students may need to dictate their sentences to an adult,
whereas others may write their sentences independently. Give students the
opportunity to share their writing with a partner or the class.]

**Show Image 12A-3: Current United States**

**flag**

As the country grew, more states were

created. With each new state, a new star was

added to the flag. Soon there were too many

stars to fit in a circle, so the patterns changed

over the years. Now we have fifty states, seen

as fifty stars arranged in rows, still on a blue

background like the original flag. The same thirteen red and white stripes

remain as reminders of the original thirteen colonies. ~~_How many of those_~~

~~_original thirteen colonies can you name? [Use the stripes of the flag to count_~~

~~_off as the students name a few.]_~~ On June 14, 1777, an official act was passed

that declared a new flag for our new nation. We still celebrate national Flag

Day every year on June 14, but our flag is flown every day, all across the

country, as a symbol of the land of freedom.


**Show Image 12A-4: Bald eagle**

The next symbol is a bald eagle, which is found

only in North America. The bald eagle is a large

bird of prey with a white head and tail, and it is

the primary, ~~_or main_~~ ~~,~~ American symbol. When

someone sees an image of the eagle, they

think of strength, courage, and freedom. These

words are also used to describe America. The

bald eagle was chosen as the primary symbol to represent America by our

founding fathers at the Second Continental Congress.


**Show Image 12A-5: The United States seal**

When the Second Continental Congress met

and declared independence from Great Britain,

they also decided that they needed an official

**seal** to represent the freedom and strength of


Lesson 12 Exploring America’s Symbols
**173**


**174**



the United States. ~~_A seal is an official image or mark._~~ A seal is also a symbol.

Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams met to design the

seal. As there was not much time, the men agreed on only part of the seal: a

statement that read “E Pluribus Unum,” which means, in Latin, “out of many,

one.” They chose this saying because they were making one nation out of

many separate states and many people with different backgrounds.


It was not until six years later, in 1782, that the bald eagle—a symbol of long

life, strength, and freedom—was officially added to the seal. ~~_[As you read_~~

~~_the description of the seal, point to the appropriate parts of it.]_~~ On the seal,

the eagle holds an olive branch, symbolizing the power of peace, in one of its

talons; in the other, it grips a bundle of thirteen arrows, symbolizing the power

of war. Covering its chest is a shield of red and white stripes, and around its

head is a crest with thirteen stars. Why do you think there are thirteen arrows

and thirteen stars on the seal? ~~_[Explain to the students that these represent_~~

~~_the thirteen colonies.]_~~ If you look carefully, you might be able to read the words

written on the scroll in its bill: “E Pluribus Unum”—out of many, one.


**Show Image 12A-6: Turkey and bald eagle**

Did you know that not everyone thought

that the bald eagle was the best choice to

represent America? America almost ended

up with a turkey as the national symbol!

~~_What animal would you choose to represent_~~

~~_America? [Pause for students’ responses.]_~~

Benjamin Franklin thought a turkey would be

a better symbol than an eagle. In a letter he wrote to his daughter, Benjamin

Franklin explains: “For my own part, I wish the Bald Eagle had not been

chosen as the Representative of our Country . . . For in Truth the Turkey is

in Comparison a much more respectable Bird.” However, members of the

Second Continental Congress voted, and the eagle won. Now, when someone

sees a bald eagle, they think of America’s strength, courage, and freedom.


**Show Image 12A-7: The Liberty Bell**

It is pretty easy to understand how the stars

and stripes of the flag and an eagle became

symbols for our nation, but what about a bell?

The **Liberty** Bell, another well-known symbol,

is actually older than the United States itself.

~~_Liberty means freedom._~~ It is only about three


Unit 8 American Independence


feet tall ~~_[Show students about how tall three feet is.]_~~, but it weighs as much

as a hippopotamus! In 1751, the mostly copper bell was hung on a building in

Philadelphia, where it was rung to call people to meetings in the town square.


Over the years, the bell cracked and was repaired several times. Finally,

cracked beyond repair, the bell was rung for the very last time on George

Washington’s birthday in 1846. On the side of the bell there is a motto, or

saying, taken from the Bible that reads “ **Proclaim** LIBERTY throughout all

the Land unto all the Inhabitants thereof [1] .” ~~_Proclaim means to tell others_~~

~~_something important. In this motto, or saying, they are telling others that the_~~

~~_United States and its inhabitants, or everyone who lives there, are free. Why_~~

~~_do you think our Founding Fathers chose these words to be written on the_~~

~~_bell? [Pause for students’ responses.]_~~


**Show Image 12A-8: Washington’s Bible**

Many people believe the Liberty Bell was

designed to celebrate the traditions of religious

freedom and self-government in the colony of

Pennsylvania. The motto for the Liberty Bell





was inspired by a story in the Hebrew Bible,

which is also reorganized as the Old Testament



of the Christian Bible. The story describes a man named Moses who lived a

long time ago in ancient Egypt. ~~_[Point to Egypt on a world map.]_~~


According to the Bible, thousands of years ago, the Hebrew people lived in Egypt

as slaves, without any freedom. Moses received messages from his God and led

the Hebrew people out of slavery in Egypt. The work to secure their freedom was

far from easy, and it involved much sacrifice and hard work over many years.

But eventually the Hebrew people reached freedom in their new Promised Land.

~~_It was called the Promised Land because they believed God had promised it to_~~

~~_their forefathers many years before._~~ Along the journey to the Promised Land,

Moses received many messages from his God. God told Moses about the laws

he wanted his people to follow—laws that were designed to help ensure that the

Hebrew people would live in peace in the freedom of their new land.


1Leviticus 25:10


Lesson 12 Exploring America’s Symbols
**175**


**Show Image 12A-9: The Liberty Bell**

The motto on the Liberty Bell was one of

the messages Moses received and it states:

“Proclaim LIBERTY throughout all the Land

unto all the Inhabitants thereof.”


The American Flag, the bald eagle, and the

Liberty Bell are all symbols of freedom in



**176**



America. As you go through your day, be on the lookout for flags, eagles, and

bells—symbols to remind us of our country’s founders, who fought for our

freedom long ago.


**Confirm Predictions:** During the reading we made predictions about the

importance of each symbol. How were your predictions right and how were

they wrong? How do you know?

###### Culminating Activities


~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


Please use these final two days to address class results of the Unit
Assessment. We suggest you begin with the whole-class Read-Aloud activity
to reinforce unit content. Based on the results of the Unit Assessment and
students’ formative assessments, you may wish to use the remaining time to
provide remediation opportunities that target specific areas of weakness for
individual students, small groups, or the whole class.


Alternatively, you may also choose to use this class time to extend or enrich
students’ experience with unit knowledge. A number of enrichment activities
are provided in this section in order to provide students with opportunities to
enliven their experiences with unit concepts.


~~**READ-ALOUD**~~


  - Ask students to name some things they have learned about how Ben Franklin

helped during the American Revolution. _(Answers may vary but students_
_should draw on information they learned in this Unit, such as that Franklin was_
_part of the Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention.)_


  - Ask students to name some of Franklin’s inventions. _(Answers may vary,_
_but students may recall learning about the rocking chair or lightning rod.)_


  - Tell students that today they will learn more about Franklin’s inventions.


  - Tell students to listen to learn about Franklin’s inventions and how they
continue to affect our world today.


~~**REMEDIATION**~~


Remediation opportunities include:


  - targeting Review Activities


  - revisiting lesson Applications


  - rereading and discussing select Read-Alouds


  - reading the corresponding lesson in the Learning Lab


Unit 8 American Independence


~~**ENRICHMENT**~~


**Letters to People Who Made a Difference**

 - Have students choose people introduced in this unit about whom they wish
they knew more.


 - Ask them to brainstorm a list of questions they would ask that person.


 - Then have students write letters using their lists of questions as
starting points.


**Symbol Search**

 - Have students go on a symbol walk, searching for the three symbols of

freedom introduced in this unit: the eagle, the flag, and the Liberty Bell.
Students may also search books for these symbols.


**You Were There: People Who Made a Difference**

 - Have students pretend that they are one of the people that lived in
America during its struggle for independence from Great Britain.


 - Ask students to describe who they are and what they did. For example,
for George Washington, students may talk about his role as a commander,
leading men into battle at Valley Forge and Yorktown.


**Image Review/Writing**

 - Tell students that as a class, they are going to write a short retelling of a

Read-Aloud you have just read. One by one, show images from any story.


 - When you show an image, brainstorm ideas for a sentence that explains
what is happening in that picture. Write the sentence on a piece of chart
paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard and then read it to the class.


 - After writing sentences about the images, model for the students how to

write a concluding sentence. Reread the entire paragraph to the class.



Challenge


If students are ready to do
so, have them write their
own sentences.

**PLANNING AN INFORMATIONAL PARAGRAPH:**
~~**POSSIBLE IMAGE CHOICES AND CONNECTIONS**~~


You may find the following images and connections helpful as you help students plan their
informational paragraphs. There are, of course, other connections that are possible. This is just
intended to be a quick-reference list to help you scaffold with students who may have trouble
deciding on images or finding their connections. It is recommended that only students who
would benefit from an extra challenge use three images, as more connections and more writing
will be necessary.
