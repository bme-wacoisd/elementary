**Flip Book Introduction**


This Flip Book contains images that accompany the Teacher
Guide for _Fairy Tales_ . The images are in sequential order. Each
image is identified by its lesson number, Read-Aloud letter
(A or B), and the number of the image within the particular
Read-Aloud. For example, the first image in Read-Aloud 1A is
numbered 1A-1. Once you have worked your way through the
book to the last page, you will flip the entire book over to view
the second half of the images.


Depending on your classroom configuration, you may need
to have students sit closer to the Flip Book in order to see the
images clearly.
