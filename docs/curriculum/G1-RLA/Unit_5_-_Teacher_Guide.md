Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


**Grade 1 | Unit 5**
#### Introduction


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching the _This Planet_
_Rocks_ unit. The Teacher Guide for _This Planet Rocks_ contains eight daily lessons, each of which is
composed of two distinct parts, so the lesson may be divided into smaller chunks of time and presented
at different intervals during the day. The entire lesson will require a total of sixty minutes.


This unit includes a Pausing Point following Lesson 4, after the layers of the earth have been
introduced. At the end of the unit, a Unit Review, a Unit Assessment, and Culminating Activities are
included to allow time to review, reinforce, assess, and remediate content knowledge. You should
spend no more than fourteen days total on this unit.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


At the back of this Teacher Guide you will find a section titled “Teacher Resources.” In this section
you will find the following:


  - Activity Book Answer Key


  - Measures of Text Complexity


  - Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Correlation Chart


  - English Language Proficiency Standards Correlation Chart


~~**UNIT COMPONENTS**~~


Along with this Teacher Guide, you will need:


  - Flip Book for _This Planet Rocks_


  - Image Cards for _This Planet Rocks_


  - Activity Book for _This Planet Rocks_


  - Digital Components for _This Planet Rocks_

~~**WHY THIS PLANET ROCKS IS IMPORTANT**~~


In this unit, students will learn about the geographical features of the earth’s surface. They will also
learn about the inside of the earth and characteristics of its various layers.


Students will learn about the shape of the earth, the North and South Poles, and the equator.
Students will also learn the names of the layers of the earth—the crust, the mantle, and the core—
and the characteristics of each layer. Students will learn how occurrences such as volcanoes and
geysers give information about the layers of the earth.


The Read-Alouds also focus on minerals and rocks. Students will learn about the importance of
rocks and minerals in their daily lives. They will also learn about the three types of rocks and the
characteristics of each type. Students will learn how rocks and minerals are taken from the earth’s
crust to be used by people. Students will also learn about fossils and their importance in giving us
knowledge about the history of living things on the earth.


We recommend that you provide a collection and visual representations of fossils, rocks, and the
dinosaur models for tactile learning and find plenty of opportunities for students to interact
with these.


Students will receive a good introduction to the basics of geology and paleontology. These topics
will be reviewed and extended in much greater depth in Grade 4.


This unit also provides opportunities for students to build content knowledge and draw connections
to the science and social studies subject areas. At times throughout the unit, you may wish to build on
class discussions to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of Earth
and Space, Matter and Its Properties, Scientific and Engineering Practices, and Recurring Themes and
Concepts from the Science TEKS, as well as the strand of Geography from the Social Studies TEKS.
This content is not a replacement for grade-level science and social studies instruction. For more
information about the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the
texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED DURING KINDERGARTEN**~~


The following units, and the specific core content that was targeted in those units, are particularly
relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _This Planet Rocks_ . This background knowledge will
greatly enhance students’ understanding of the Read-Alouds they are about to enjoy:


**Plants: How Do They Grow? (Kindergarten)**


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


~~**CORE CONTENT OBJECTIVES ADDRESSED IN THIS UNIT**~~


Students will:


  - Explain that different scientists study the different kinds of rocks that make up the earth


  - Identify geographical features of the earth’s surface: oceans and continents


  - Locate the North Pole, the South Pole, and the equator on a globe


  - Describe the shape of the earth


  - Identify and describe the layers of the earth: crust, mantle, and core (outer and inner)


  - Describe how heat, pressure, and time cause many changes inside the earth


  - Describe volcanoes


  - Describe geysers


  - Identify common minerals in the earth


  - Explain how minerals are used by people


  - Identify the three types of rocks: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic


  - Describe how heat, pressure, and time cause the formation of igneous, sedimentary, and
metamorphic rocks


  - Describe fossils


  - Explain how fossils provide information about animals and plants that lived long ago


  - Explain how we know about dinosaurs


Introduction

~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR THIS PLANET ROCKS**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _This Planet Rocks_ in the forms in which
they appear in the Read-Alouds. Bold-faced words in the list have an associated Word Work activity.
The inclusion of the words on this list does not mean that students are immediately expected to
be able to use all of these words on their own. However, through repeated exposure throughout the
lessons, they should acquire a good understanding of most of these words and begin to use some of
them in conversation.

Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit, students will explore writing friendly letters. Students were introduced to the format and
parts of a friendly letter in _Early American Civilizations : Aztecs, Maya, Incas_ . Students will work as a
class to write a letter to the geologist from the Read-Alouds, describing what they learned about the
earth’s crust. In later lessons, students will work with a partner to write a letter to the paleontologist
from the read-alouds, describing what they learned about fossils. Students will also work with a
partner to write a letter to someone of their choice, describing what they learned about dinosaurs.
They will identify important facts and information during and after Read-Alouds to use in writing the
letters.


In addition to letter writing, students will draw and write about a Read-Aloud and create an idea web
graphic organizer to record information about minerals.


The following activities may be added to students’ writing portfolios to showcase student writing
within and across units:


  - Drawing the Read-Aloud (Lesson 1)


  - Idea Web: Minerals (Lesson 5)


  - Friendly Letters (Lessons 2, 7, and 8)


  - any additional writing completed during the Pausing Point, Unit Review, or Culminating Activities


~~**FOUNDATIONAL ORAL LANGUAGE**~~


The Think-Pair-Share and Turn and Talk prompts throughout the unit provide opportunities to teach
and reinforce how to communicate by using conventions of language, speaking when recognized,
and making appropriate contributions to discussion.


  - You can also reinforce these ideas by modeling using an appropriate pace, recognizing students’
individual contributions to group discussions, and pointing out conventions of language.


  - Explain to students that when working in whole/small groups, group members share responsibility
for the work they do together. To work effectively and respectfully, everyone should recognize the
contributions made by each group member. For example, as group members discuss a text, each group
member can share thoughts and reactions. If preparing to return to a whole-group discussion, group
members can summarize the group’s ideas by including contributions from everyone in the group.


  - Consider using a discussion checklist that tracks student participation, as well as introducing
discussion techniques that enhance participation.

~~**TEKS 1.1.C; TEKS 1.1.D**~~


**TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using the conventions of language;
**TEKS 1.1.D** Work collaboratively with others by following agreed-upon rules for discussion, including listening to others, speaking when recognized, and making
appropriate contributions.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Introducing the Read-Aloud**

 - Create a Where Are We? chart like the following, showing a graded diagram
of where students live. Alternatively, you can access a digital version in the
online materials for the unit.



















**8**



**Read-Aloud**


 - Place familiar items, such as a stapler, marker, basket, etc., on the surfaces of
classroom tables and desks for the Word Work activity.


**Notes to Teacher**


You may wish to leave the Where Are We? chart on display for the entire unit
to help students grasp the idea of where they are on the planet Earth.


It may be difficult for students to understand the idea that the earth is
rotating, because they cannot feel the movement. If necessary, explain to
students that we do not feel the earth move because the motion is very
smooth and everything else is moving at the same time. Remind students
that they know that the earth is moving because the sun and stars seem to
move across the sky over time.

that _history_ refers to things that happened in the past.


  - Ask students to name the planet where we live. _(Earth)_


  - Explain that the planet Earth is made up of billions of pieces of rock.


  - Explain that a billion is a very, very long number, which means that Earth has
many, many rocks to explore.


  - Emphasize that scientists are always discovering new things about the earth
and our universe. Studying rocks of the earth can tell us fascinating things
about how our planet works and how its surface changes over time.

location on the globe as you say the following:


    - You live in (your city)


    - (Your city) is in the state of Texas


    - Texas is in the country of the United States of America


    - The United States of America is on the continent of North America


    - North America is on planet Earth


  - Direct students’ attention to the Where Are We? chart you prepared in
advance.


  - Ask students to describe what they see. _(Answers may vary.)_


  - Explain that all of the places you just pointed to on the globe are presented in
a different way in the chart:


    - The city we live in is the smallest part and at the top of the diagram.


    - Each level after that is a little bit bigger than the one above it.


    - All of these levels are part of Earth.


  - Explain that even though it seems that the ground we stand on is flat and
still, we actually live on only a tiny part of a huge sphere, or ball, just like this
globe. This huge sphere is called Earth.


  - Remind students that they already learned about the solar system—our
home in space—in the _Astronomy: Space Exploration_ unit, and that Earth, the
planet on which we live, is just one of eight planets within the solar system.


  - Tell students that the earth is covered by both land and water. Point out the

Geologists use rocks to learn about the earth.
In the ancient Greek language, the word _geo_
means earth, and _–ology_ means “the study of.”
When we combine these word parts, we have
_geo-ology_, or just **geology**, which is the study

of rock, we geologists spend most of our time
studying rocks. Many of the rocks we see on the **surface** of the earth, from
mountains down to pebbles, are created by incredible forces at work deep
inside the earth. ~~_The surface of the earth is the outside or top layer of the_~~
~~_earth. We walk and live on the surface of the earth. Have you ever wondered_~~
~~_about what’s inside the earth, or under the surface where we walk and live?_~~
Thus, geologists study not only rocks but also the forces at work inside the
earth and on the earth’s surface. We study the whole earth.

Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


Check for Understanding


**Vocabulary:** Geology is the study of what? _(the earth)_ What does
each part of the word _geology_ mean? ( _geo_ means earth; _–ology_
means “the study of”)


**Show Image 1A-7: Outer space**





There are lots of rocks on our planet. Think
about sand on a beach. Each grain of sand is a
tiny piece of rock, broken apart by the oceans.
If I have a one-foot square box filled with the
smallest grains, there could be over four-and-ahalf billion grains of sand in that box. That is a
lot of tiny rocks.




~~_[Draw a one-foot square and write the number four-and-a-half billion_~~
~~_(4,500,000,000) for students so that they can get a sense of how many_~~
~~_different rock particles are on earth.]_~~ Big rocks can get formed from tiny rocks,
pressed hard together, with heat, over time. Many scientists think of Earth like
this. Imagine billions of little bits and pieces of dust and rock floating around
our sun. Those floating bits and pieces get stuck together with enough heat
and pressure and time until they make up all of the Earth. A similar process
would explain our planet’s neighbor, the moon, and the other planets.


**Show Image 1A-8: Diagram of the solar**

Maybe you already know that Earth is a planet.
Earth is one of eight major planets that orbits
the sun. ~~_[Point to Earth on the diagram.] Earth_~~
~~_is the third planet from the sun._~~ Do you know
the names of any of the other planets? ~~_[Pause_~~
~~_for responses and point out each planet on the_~~
~~_diagram.]_~~ I do! Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.



Like the other planets in the solar system, Earth is trapped in the gravitational
pull of the sun. This causes Earth to orbit, or revolve, around the sun. It takes
one year, about 365 days, for Earth to complete an orbit around the sun. ~~_[Ask_~~
~~_two students to demonstrate by having one student be the stationary sun and_~~
~~_the other be the orbiting Earth.]_~~

Earth’s orbit around the sun is not the _only_
way Earth moves in space, however.

The word _stick_ also means
to attach something to a

This map shows the earth’s North and South
Poles. ~~_[Point to the North and South Poles in_~~

~~_Pole and a circle marking the South Pole._~~ The
North and South Poles are the northernmost and southernmost parts of
the earth. The axis of rotation is like an imaginary line or stick going right
through the earth at the North and South Poles. ~~_Here, the word_~~ ~~stick~~ ~~_means_~~
~~_a long, thin piece of wood._~~ There is not really a stick running through the
earth around which it turns. The axis is an imaginary line around which Earth
rotates. The earth rotates, or spins, in the same way that a globe spins—on
its axis. It takes one day, or twenty-four hours, for Earth to make a complete
rotation. ~~_[Use a globe to demonstrate rotation.] It takes one day for Earth to_~~
~~_go all the way around its axis. As the earth rotates, it also orbits the sun. [You_~~
~~_may wish to demonstrate both motions of Earth by turning around and around_~~
~~_as you walk in a circle around a student volunteer playing the stationary sun.]_~~



The map also shows the **equator**, an imaginary line around the middle of the
earth. ~~_[Point to the equator on the map. Tell students that the word_~~ ~~equator~~
~~_sounds like the word_~~ ~~equal~~ ~~_. We can remember that the equator cuts the earth_~~
~~_into two equal halves.]_~~ The equator divides the earth into two equal halves.
The area along the equator receives the most direct sunlight and is therefore
warm year-round.


**Show Image 1A-10: Earth from space**

Earth is sphere-shaped, like a ball, and it is

surrounded by a thick blanket of air, called

an atmosphere, where clouds float around.

Most of the earth’s surface is covered with

water in the form of the five oceans: ~~_[Point out_~~





~~_the oceans and continents that are visible as_~~

~~_you read.]_~~ Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Arctic, and



Southern (or Antarctic). And between these oceans there is land in the form

of seven continents: North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia,

Australia, and Antarctica.


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


People haven’t always known that the earth is round or that it rotates on its

axis as well as orbits the sun; they haven’t always known that there are five

oceans and seven continents, or that most of the surface is covered in water.

It has taken hundreds of years for scientists and explorers to develop all the

knowledge about the earth that I just described in the last few minutes. But

this barely begins to scratch the surface of what we now know about the earth.

~~_“This barely begins to scratch the surface” is a phrase that people say when they_~~

~~_mean that they have learned a small part about something and that there is still_~~

~~_so much more to learn about that something. By exploring, asking questions, and_~~

~~_digging deeper into the information we can learn more about the earth._~~


**Show Image 1A-11: Heat, pressure, and time**





There are three important words you need to
keep in mind whenever you are thinking about
geology, which is the study of the earth. _Heat_
is the first. You can feel heat from a flame or
from the sun on a sunny day. Heat causes
many changes to the earth.



The second word is **pressure**, like the force you use when you push on
something. ~~_[Pause for students to push their hands together using pressure.]_~~
Pressure, or the force of weight, also causes many changes to the earth.


_Time_ is the third important geology word to remember. To understand
geology, you need to think about time in a whole new way. Forget about
minutes, hours, and days. These amounts of time don’t mean much in
geology. Geologist think in terms of many years. A little pressure and heat
and a long time can make a big difference. It works the other way, too. A lot of
heat or pressure in a short time can make a great deal of difference


**Show Image 1A-12: Grand Canyon with view**
**of Colorado River**

The Grand Canyon, located in Arizona,

provides a lot of clues about how parts of

the earth formed. Rushing water in the river

carved through the rocks over time to make





this canyon. No other place on earth allows

me to see and study so many different layers



of rock at the same time. The Grand Canyon displays more than 20 layers of

rock, and each layer is like a page in Earth’s History book. Each layer weighs

down on the rock below it, building up lots of pressure over time.

Hello! Gerry the Geologist here again. I woke

up this morning and started digging this hole

in the ground. Each time I push my shovel into

the earth, I bring up a load of soil, and I’ve





noticed that each load of soil has a few rocks

in it. I am digging this hole today to teach you

about the outer **layer** of the earth. ~~_The earth_~~

Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


**Show Image 2A-2: Topsoil and clay**

Beneath your backyard, the sidewalk, the

school—actually, beneath most every place

people live—there is soil, which is sometimes

called dirt. Different types of soil appear in the

earth in layers. Each layer of soil is made of

different things, which can give it a different

color or a different texture. ~~_Texture means_~~



~~_what something feels like when you touch it._~~


The thickness of the soil varies, or is different, depending on where you live.

In some places on the earth, the soil is several feet thick. ~~_[Show the depths of_~~

~~_“several feet” and then “a few inches” with a ruler or yardstick as you continue_~~

~~_reading.]_~~ In other places on the earth it is just a few inches, and in some

places on the earth there is no soil at all. Here, where I live, the soil is rich

and dark near the surface. However, as I dig deeper into the earth, I can see

a definite change in color. ~~_Here, the word_~~ ~~change~~ ~~_means to become or make_~~

~~_different._~~ The color in this soil has changed from dark brown to bright red.

That color change means I have reached a layer of reddish clay. It’s getting a

little harder to dig now, so I’ll have to use my pickax.


**Show Image 2A-3: Topsoil, clay, and bedrock**

Clank! My pick just hit something really hard

below the red clay. The farther down I go, the

harder the clay becomes. Pretty soon, I will hit

bedrock—a solid layer of hard rock that I won’t

~~_students’ attention to the model you prepared_~~

I dug this hole to show you that there are different layers of soil and rock

beneath your feet. The farther you go into the earth, the more things change.

The dark soil on top is fairly easy to dig into with a shovel, but the deeper

layer of clay is harder to dig because it has been compacted—or squished—

by the weight or pressure of everything above it. ~~_Remember_~~ ~~pressure~~ ~~_is one_~~

~~_of the three words Gerry said we should keep in mind. Pressure, or pushing,_~~

~~_from top layers is one reason deeper layers of soil are harder to dig._~~

Have several students
point to the diagram as
they identify each layer of
the earth.

**Show Image 2A-4: Diagram of the layers of**

This diagram shows you what the inside of the

earth would look like if you could cut out a big

chunk of it. The **crust** is the outermost layer

~~_read about it.]_~~ I have been digging into the

very outermost portion of the crust today.


Most of the earth is rock, and most of that rock is beneath the crust in the

other three layers: the **mantle** (red), the outer **core** (orange), and the inner

core (yellow). The distance from the surface—where you and I live—all the

way to the middle of the inner core, is nearly four thousand miles. ~~_[Show_~~

~~_students the distance from New York to California on a map.] The distance_~~

~~_from the surface to the middle of the inner core is one thousand miles farther_~~

~~_than the width of the United States!_~~ This is one thick planet!


**Show Image 2A-5: Earth’s crust**

I will teach you more about the mantle, outer

core, and inner core next time. For now, let’s

focus on the thinnest layer: the crust. The

earth’s crust is between three and twenty





miles, depending on where you are on earth.

~~_[Fill in the blanks with locations you prepared_~~

~~_in advance.] Three miles would be about the_~~



~~_distance from here to_~~ ~~_; twenty miles would be about the distance_~~

~~_from here to_~~ ~~_._~~ Most people, plants, and animals live on the surface, or

outermost edge, of the crust.


Remember, the earth’s surface is covered by oceans and continents.

Everything alive on Earth lives in, on, or above these oceans and continents

on the crust. For example, you and your dog live on the crust. Worms and

moles, on the other hand, live underground, or in the crust. Birds fly in the air

above the crust, and fish swim in the water that is flowing on the crust.


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


**Show Image 2A-6: Layers in the crust**

The crust is where geologists like me look

to learn about how the surface of the earth

changes over time. In the crust, we find

different layers of rock, which give us clues on

how parts of the earth were formed


Each layer of rock is different, so we can study

each layer to learn different things about how

our earth works.


**Show Image 2A-7: Grand Canyon**

Geologists search the crust for clues about the

earth. I already introduced you to this place,

called the Grand Canyon. Here, the geology of

the earth’s crust sits like an open book waiting

to be read. ~~“An open book”~~ ~~_is a saying that_~~

~~_means something is easy to learn about and_~~

~~_understand._~~ Layer upon layer of different rock



tells the geologist when this place was covered with a cool ocean and when

it was not. ~~_The Grand Canyon makes it easy for geologists to learn about the_~~

~~_earth’s crust because all of the layers are visible and easy to see._~~


**Show Image 2A-8: Arches National Park**

Geological or earth changes can do all sorts of

tricky things to the rocks on the earth’s crust.

These formations in Arches National Park, in

the state of Utah, show what many years of

wind, rain, and ice can do to this type of stone.

**Show Image 2A-10: Cave**

Different places tell different stories. Not all

interesting rocks are above ground. This photo

was taken down in a cave, which is a large

hole or space underground. A cave is basically

an area in the earth’s crust that has been





hollowed out for one reason or another, usually

as a result of underground water flowing in



and dissolving the rock over many years. Caves are really amazing places to

explore!


**Show Image 2A-11: Gerry with shovel looking**

People usually do not think too much about

what is happening underground, deep below

our feet, but the fact is that what happens

deep underground has everything to do with





what we see in the world around us. Next time,

we will take a closer look at what’s happening

 - Explain that if something is solid, it keeps its shape.


 - Tell students that if you pick up a book and hand it to someone else, it will still
keep its same shape. It keeps its shape because the book is solid.


 - Ask students for examples of other things that are solid, or that keep their
shape. _(Answers may vary.)_


 - Explain that if something is liquid, it can be poured. It doesn’t keep its shape,
but takes on the shape of its container.


 - Show students two clear containers with different shapes. Have students
watch as you pour water from one container to another.


 - Tell students that water is liquid because it takes the shape of whatever
container it is in.


 - Ask students for examples of other things that are liquid, or that take the
shape of whatever container they are in. _(Answers may vary.)_


 - Explain that if something is gas, it is often hard to see.


 - Explain that the air around us is gas. It is not solid because it does not keep
its shape, and it is not liquid because it cannot be poured.


 - Ask students for examples of other things that are gas. [This may be difficult
for students to answer.] _(Answers may vary. Some students may have heard_
_of oxygen and carbon dioxide.)_


 - Explain that heat can change things from solid to liquid to gas.


 - Tell students that an ice cube is the solid form of water. When heated, an ice
cube can melt and become water, which is liquid. When water is boiled, it

The first stop is the layer beneath the crust, which is called the mantle. The

mantle is a whopping 1,800 miles thick and contains most of the earth’s

rock. ~~_[Show students the distance from New York to Colorado on a map and_~~

~~_tell them that it is roughly the thickness of the mantle.]_~~ Because most of the

Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


The mantle is mostly made of **solid** rock. The closer to the crust, the cooler

and harder the mantle tends to be. But as you go deeper, closer to the core,

the mantle gets hotter and becomes soft and gooey. Heat closer to the core

causes the rock inside the mantle to move around quite a bit. But in most

places, it is still solid rather than **liquid** . ~~_Did you hear the word_~~ ~~heat~~ ~~_again?_~~

~~_Heat causes parts of the mantle to move around. Remember, something that_~~

~~_is solid keeps its shape, while something that is liquid can move around and_~~

~~_take the shape of whatever it is in._~~


The mantle surrounds the core, or center, of the earth. The core has two parts:

the inner core and the outer core. The inner core is a solid metal ball. The outer

core is also metal, but it is not solid—it is made up of melted, or **molten**, metal.

~~_If metal is molten, heat has changed it from solid to liquid._~~ This means that

deep down inside the earth—thousands of miles beneath your feet—there is a

giant sea of red-hot, molten metal surrounding a solid metal ball.


Check for Understanding


**Making Connections:** What does it mean if the inner core is
solid? _(The inner core does not change shape.)_


Scientists estimate that the very center of the earth—the inner core—is

actually hotter than the surface of the sun, which is a blazing 10,000 °F! ~~_A_~~

~~_really hot day in the United States is about 100 °F, so 10,000 °F is extremely_~~

~~_hot! [Write out the two numbers so that students can see just how much bigger_~~

~~_10,000 is, compared to 100.]_~~ The inner core is much hotter than the outer

core. It may seem strange, therefore, that the outer core of the earth is molten

metal, yet the inner core—at the very center of the earth where it is hottest—is

a solid ball of metal, which, by the way, is just a bit smaller than the moon!


The reason that the inner core is solid has to do with the incredible pressure

of the earth’s entire weight pressing inward. The more pressure you put on

something, the more heat you need to cause that thing to boil or melt. This

is why the metal at the very center of the earth—the inner core—is solid

instead of liquid. Despite the intense heat, there is simply too much pressure

caused by the weight of the rest of the earth, so the center of the earth

cannot melt, and it remains solid. ~~_Did you hear the word_~~ ~~pressure~~ ~~_again?_~~

~~_Pressure causes the inner core to be solid rather than liquid._~~



Challenge


Ask students how the
temperature of the
earth’s layers changes as
you travel deeper into
the earth.



Lesson 3 The Earth Inside-Out, Part II
**45**


**Show Image 3A-2: San Bernardino Mountains**

The crust upon which we live is constantly

being changed and reshaped due to heat and

pressure caused by activity in the earth’s

mantle and core. ~~_Did you hear the words_~~ ~~heat~~

~~_and_~~ ~~pressure~~ ~~_again? Heat and pressure in the_~~

~~_earth’s mantle change the earth’s crust._~~ The

San Bernardino Mountains that you see in this



picture, along with many other mountains along the West Coast of North

America, from Mexico to Alaska, were created by changes inside the earth.


**Show Image 3A-3: Diagram of a volcano**

Remember, the parts of the mantle that are

closest to the core are soft and gooey. That

hot, gooey material in the mantle does not

always stay in the mantle. Sometimes it rises

up to the surface. Every so often, some of that





extremely hot molten rock, or magma, pushes

up through the mantle and forces its way into



Support


You may wish to explain
that magma is molten
rock that is deep inside
the mantle and lava is
magma that has come out
onto the earth’s surface.
Students will learn more
about these terms in the
next Read-Aloud.


**46**



cracks and crevices in the crust.


Over time, the magma collects in a magma chamber, such as the one near

the bottom of the picture. The heat in the magma chamber releases gas from

the magma, which builds up and creates pressure. The pressure builds and

builds until . . . one day . . . BOOM! ~~_Did you hear the words_~~ ~~heat~~ ~~_and_~~ ~~pressure~~

~~_again? Heat and pressure cause volcanoes to erupt._~~ The magma **erupts** in a

**volcano** of lava, ash, and gas. Once it is released from the earth, the magma

becomes lava—flowing liquid rock, which flows across the ground until it

cools and hardens into solid rock once again. ~~_The eruption of lava, ash, and_~~

~~_gas forms a volcano._~~


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


**Show Image 3A-4: Volcano**

~~_What do you see in this picture?_~~


Now that I have told you about volcanoes,

let me explain one more thing. Thanks to

geologists, we have a pretty good idea when

and where these geologic events are likely to

occur. Geologists help predict where volcanoes

are most likely to occur, and this helps keep



people safe by discouraging them from building homes close to dangerous

areas. It is not always possible to predict when and where geologic disasters

will occur, but geologists work hard to give people as much warning as we

can. ~~_Disasters are sudden events that cause a lot of damage._~~


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What are the names of the layers of the earth? _(The names of the_
_layers of the earth are the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core.)_


2. **Literal.** Describe the mantle. _(The mantle contains most of the earth’s rock;_
_it gets hotter and softer closer to the core.)_


3. **Literal.** Describe the outer core. _(The outer core of the earth is molten_
_metal.)_ Describe the inner core. _(The inner core is a solid metal ball.)_

   - **Inferential.** Why is the inner core solid rather than liquid? _(The inner core_
_is solid rather than liquid because there is too much pressure from the_
_weight of the rest of the earth to allow the inner core to melt.)_


4. **Literal.** What causes a volcano to form? _(Magma inside the earth makes its_
_way to the surface of the earth and causes a volcano to form.)_

   - **Inferential.** Why is it important for scientists to study volcanoes? _(It is_
_important for scientists to study volcanoes so they can learn more about_
_them and help keep people safe from geological disasters.)_


Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** How are the crust, mantle, and core of the
earth alike? _(They are all layers of the earth_ .) How are they
different? _(The crust, mantle, and core are different because some_
_parts are solid and some parts are liquid. The crust, mantle, and_
_core are also different because some parts are hotter than others.)_

1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Heat closer to the core causes the rock inside
the mantle to move around quite a bit. But in most places, it is still solid
rather than liquid.”


2. Say the word _solid_ with me.


3. If something is _solid_, it keeps its shape.


4. It was so cold outside last night that the water puddle became solid ice.


5. What things have you seen that are solid? Try to use the word _solid_ when you
tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase
students’ responses: “ is solid.”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I will name an object. If it is
something that is solid, say, “That is solid.” If it is something that is not solid,
say, “That is not solid.”

**Conjunction And**

  - Explain that a conjunction is a kind of word used to connect words and phrases.


  - Explain that the conjunction **and** is used to join words and phrases that share
similar ideas, or ideas that are alike.


  - Read aloud the following excerpt from the Read-Aloud about one of the
earth’s layers. Note that you will emphasize the word **and** as you read:


_The first stop is the layer beneath the crust, which is called the mantle._
_The mantle is a whopping 1,800 miles thick_ **and** _contains most of_
_the earth’s rock . . . The closer to the crust, the cooler_ **and** _harder the_
_mantle tends to be. But as you go deeper, closer to the core, the mantle_
_gets hotter_ **and** _becomes soft_ **and** _gooey._


  - Note that in this excerpt, Gerry the Geologist uses the word **and** when he
talks about two facts or ideas that are both about the mantle. The word **and**
helps him to not repeat the word _mantle_ over and over again.


  - Read the following sentences aloud to students:

    - David plays soccer.


    - David plays basketball.


  - Explain that these sentences can be combined using the word **and** .


    - David plays soccer **and** basketball.


  - Note that because David plays both sports, you do not have to say “David
plays” twice and can just use the word **and** .


  - Read the following sentences aloud to students:

    - I have milk after school.

    - I have cookies after school.


  - Ask students how these sentences can be combined using the word **and** .

**Show Image 4A-2: Hawaii**

Ah, Hawaii. I just love this place. The land

is beautiful, the people are friendly, the

weather is perfect, and the surfing is terrific.

Personally, however, my favorite part of Hawaii





is the volcanoes. If you like volcanoes—and all

geologists do—then there is really no better

place than Hawaii!



When most people think of volcanoes, they think of the top blowing off a

mountain and **lava** flowing out everywhere. ~~_Lava is magma or molten rock_~~

~~_that has come out onto the earth’s surface._~~ Volcanic activity actually comes

in many different forms, not all of which are as spectacular as a mountaintop

eruption ~~_or explosion_~~ .


**Show Image 4A-3: World map with**
**Hawaii circled**

~~_[Show students where Hawaii is located on a_~~

Hawaii is made up of eight major islands,

seven of which are inhabited. ~~_If a place is_~~

Lesson 4 The Earth Inside-Out, Part III
**57**


The islands of Hawaii were formed by volcanic activity. In other words, if it

weren’t for volcanoes, Hawaii would not be there at all.


**Show Image 4A-4: Island volcano**

Hawaii is one of the best known volcanic hot

spots in the whole world. A hot spot is a place

where there has been continuous volcanic

activity for a long time. ~~_Why do you think_~~





~~_it’s called a hot spot?_~~ In Hawaii’s case, the

volcanic activity started underwater. In fact,

most volcanic activity occurs underwater,



deep down near the ocean floor. Down there, the crust is fairly thin, so it’s

easier for **magma** to seep up from the mantle. ~~_Magma is molten rock that is_~~

~~_deep inside the mantle of the earth. What is it called once it comes out onto_~~

~~_the earth’s surface? (lava)_~~


When a volcano erupts underwater, the lava it releases cools very quickly.

Over time this lava piles up. ~~_Did you hear the word_~~ ~~time~~ ~~_? It takes a very long_~~

~~_time for lava to pile up into mountains._~~ That is what happened in Hawaii. Over

time, the lava continually erupting from the hot spot built up a pile that now

reaches from the deep ocean floor all the way to the ocean surface, where it

became new, dry land.


Check for Understanding


**Use Evidence:** How did Hawaii form? _(Over time, lava continually_
_erupted from a hot spot. The lava built up in a pile as it cooled. The_
_pile reached from the deep ocean floor all the way to the ocean_
_surface, where it became new, dry land.)_


**Show Image 4A-5: Volcanoes National Park**

Hawaiian volcanoes erupt gradually, or little

by little. The lava bubbles and gurgles and

sputters rather than shooting up out of

the earth all at once. There is still plenty of





volcanic activity on some Hawaiian islands,

which means the island chain is still growing.


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks



**58**


**Show Image 4A-6: Mount St. Helens prior**
**to eruption**

Now let’s compare the Hawaiian volcano to

another type of volcano—the kind where a

mountaintop explodes! This volcano erupted

in the state of Washington, which is on the

West Coast of the United States. ~~_[Point out_~~

~~_the state of Washington on a U.S. map.]_~~ This



is what Mount St. Helens looked like until the year 1980. Mount St. Helens

proves that it is generally fairly easy to predict where a volcano will erupt; the

hard part is figuring out when.


**Show Image 4A-7: Eruption of Mount**
**St. Helens**

Mount St. Helens has erupted many times

over the course of 40,000 or so years, and

during this time the mountain’s size and shape

has changed. Magma is constantly building up





within Mount St. Helens. Unlike the magma in

the Hawaiian volcanoes, however, the magma



in this area is much stickier, so it does not gurgle and sputter through little

vents. Instead, the magma gets stuck, and incredible pressure builds up

within the mountain. Eventually, the pressure becomes so intense that the

mountain cannot hold it anymore, and . . . BOOM! ~~_Did you hear the word_~~

~~pressure~~ ~~_? Pressure caused the volcano to erupt._~~


The eruption of Mount St. Helens was the most **destructive** volcanic

eruption in U.S. history. ~~_The word_~~ ~~destructive~~ ~~_means causing damage._~~

Hundreds of homes were destroyed and thousands of acres of forest were

leveled, ~~_or flattened_~~ ~~,~~ when this mighty volcano erupted. In an instant, the

top and one side of the mountain were literally blown away. Lava was not the

main problem with Mount St. Helens. Rather, it was the immense amount

of rock and ash that exploded into the air, as well as the landslides that

followed, as the mountain came crashing down into the valley below.



Challenge


Have students identify
similarities and
differences between a
Hawaiian volcano and
Mount St. Helens.



Lesson 4 The Earth Inside-Out, Part III
**59**


**Show Image 4A-8: Mount St. Helens today**

This is what Mount St. Helens looks like today.

It’s still tall enough to rise above the clouds,

but if you compare this to the first picture

you saw, you can see that it is not the same

mountain it used to be. ~~_[Turn back to Image_~~

~~_4A-6 to remind students of what Mount St._~~

~~_Helens looked liked before the destructive_~~



~~_eruption.]_~~ Mount St. Helens has erupted several more times after that day in

1980, and it still erupts occasionally to this day.


**Show Image 4A-9: Yellowstone Caldera**

Here is another place in the United States

where there is lots of volcanic activity. This

place is called Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone is mostly in Wyoming, with parts

of it extending into Idaho and Montana.





Yellowstone National Park is home to many

interesting and beautiful sites. ~~_[Point out_~~



~~_Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana on a U.S. map.]_~~ Like Hawaii, Yellowstone is

situated on top of a hot spot, a place where there is lots of magma close to

the surface. In Yellowstone, the magma has stayed underground and has not

erupted onto the surface.


**Show Image 4A-10: Hot springs and geysers**

Yellowstone is famous for its **geysers** . A

geyser is a rare geologic event that occurs

when water seeps down through cracks into

the crust and meets up with hot rocks. When

the water touches the hot rocks, it turns into





steam. ~~_Heat causes the liquid water to become_~~

~~_a gas called steam, like the steam that comes_~~



**60**



~~_out of a hot bowl of soup._~~ As more water seeps in, more steam is created,

and pressure begins to build. Eventually, all this heat and pressure force the

steam to find a way back out. ~~_Did you hear the words_~~ ~~heat~~ ~~_and_~~ ~~pressure~~ ~~_? Heat_~~

~~_and pressure cause geysers to erupt._~~ As in other types of volcanic activity

that you have learned about, this process is caused by the build-up and

release of pressure underground.


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


The result is a geyser—steam and water spewing up out of the earth. ~~_Lava_~~

~~_spews out of a volcano. What spews out of a geyser?_~~ These particular geysers

are relatively small. They spurt and bubble all day long in water pools, or

springs, which have a pretty, bluish-green color created by certain minerals

that collect there.


**Show Image 4A-11: Old Faithful**

This geyser has a name: it’s called Old Faithful.

The word _faithful_ means trustworthy or

reliable. ~~_Why do you think the geyser might be_~~

~~_called Old Faithful? What does it mean to be_~~

~~_reliable?_~~ Old Faithful got its name because





you can count on the fact that it is going to

erupt several times each day. It is not possible

to predict exactly when it will erupt, but it



typically erupts about every ninety minutes, give or take a few.


Old Faithful spews out steam and hot water for anywhere from one to five

minutes. It can spew as much as 8,000 gallons of water up to 185 feet in the

air. Every day during the summer, when the park is full of visitors, hundreds

of people gather around to watch the world’s most famous geyser.


**Show Image 4A-12: Volcano**

Although they come in many forms, shapes,

and sizes, all volcanoes and geysers have two

things in common: they are the earth’s way

of releasing heat and pressure from deep

underground, and each one tells us a little





more about the earth. And one other thing: all

volcanoes and geysers are extremely hot, so

always keep a safe distance and admire them

from afar!

**Grade 1 | Unit 5**
#### Pausing Point


~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


You should pause here and spend two days reviewing, reinforcing, or
extending the material taught thus far.


You may have students do any combination of the activities listed below,
but it is highly recommended you use the Mid-Unit Assessment to assess
students’ knowledge of the layers of the earth. The other activities may be
done in any order. You may also choose to do an activity with the whole class
or with a small group of students who would benefit from the particular
activity.


~~**CORE CONTENT OBJECTIVES UP TO THIS PAUSING POINT**~~


Students will:


  - Explain that different scientists study the different kinds of rocks that make
up the earth


  - Identify geographical features of the earth’s surface: oceans and continents


  - Locate the North Pole, the South Pole, and the equator on a globe


  - Describe the shape of the earth


  - Identify and describe the layers of the earth: crust, mantle, and core (outer
and inner)


  - Describe how heat, pressure, and time cause many changes inside the earth


  - Describe volcanoes


  - Describe geysers


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


~~**MID-UNIT ASSESSMENT**~~


**The Layers of the Earth**


**Directions:** Label the layers of the earth. Color the crust brown, the mantle
red, the outer core orange, and the inner core yellow.


~~**ACTIVITIES**~~


**The Earth’s Surface**


Materials: Globe

 - Use the globe to review the shape of the earth.


 - Have students locate the continents, oceans, North Pole, South Pole, and
equator.


**Image Review**

 - Show the Flip Book images from any Read-Aloud again, and have students
retell the Read-Aloud using the images.


**Image Card Review**


Materials: Image Cards 1–6

 - In your hand, hold Image Cards 1–6 fanned out like a deck of cards: 1 (heat),
2 (pressure), 3 (time), 4 (Earth’s layers), 5 (volcano), 6 (geyser).


 - Ask a student to choose a card but not show it to anyone else in the class.
The student must then perform an action or give a clue about the picture
they are holding. For example, for pressure, a student may use their hand
to put pressure on a table. The rest of the class will guess what is being
described.


 - Proceed to another card when the correct answer has been given.


**Student Choice**

 - Have a student select a Read-Aloud to be heard again.

**Layers of the Earth: Peach**


Materials: Peach


**Note:** Be sure to follow your school’s policy regarding food distribution and
allergies. Also, be aware that some students may have food insecurities. You
may want to substitute the actual object with an image.


 - Bring in a fresh peach that has been cut into halves, and use it as a model of
the layers of the earth.


 - Point to the skin of the peach and ask students what it might represent.
_(crust)_


 - Point to the fleshy fruit and ask students what it might represent. _(mantle)_


 - Point to the pit and ask students what it might represent. _(core)_


**Layers of the Earth: Hard-Boiled Egg**


Materials: Hard-Boiled egg


**Note:** Be sure to follow your school’s policy regarding food distribution and
allergies. Also, be aware that some students may have food insecurities. You
may want to substitute the actual object with an image.


 - Bring in a Hard-Boiled egg and use it as a model of the layers of the earth.


 - Point to the eggshell and ask students what it might represent. _(crust)_


 - Point to the white interior and ask students what it might represent. _(mantle)_


 - Point to the yellow yolk and ask students what it might represent. _(core)_


**Model Earth’s Layers**


Materials: Yellow, orange, red, and brown modeling dough/clay; paper
plates; small pieces of paper; writing tools

 - Divide students into groups of five.


 - Give one student in each group some yellow dough for the inner core. Ask the
student to shape it into a tight ball.


 - Provide the next student with a similar-sized amount of orange dough for the
outer core and ask them to layer the orange dough around the yellow dough
or inner core.


 - Provide the third student with a larger amount of red dough and have them
layer it over the orange dough to represent the earth’s mantle.


 - Next, give the fourth student a smaller amount of brown dough to create the
earth’s thin crust.


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


  - Have each group place their model on a paper plate.


  - Ask the fifth student to cut the ball in half with a plastic knife.


  - Working as a group, have students label their model by writing _inner core_,
_outer core_, _mantle_, and _crust_ on small pieces of paper and placing them on
top of the corresponding model layers.


  - Ask each group to show the class their model, name one layer of the earth,
and tell their classmates something they learned about that layer.


**You Were There: Volcanoes and Geysers**


Materials: Board/chart paper


**Note:** You may wish to display the question words on the board or chart
paper.


  - Have students pretend they witnessed the eruption of a volcano or geyser.


  - Ask students to describe what they saw and heard. For example, for
“volcano,” students may talk about seeing the red-hot lava or seeing ash in
the air. They may talk about hearing the loud explosion.


  - Consider also extending this activity by adding group or independent writing
opportunities associated with the “You Were There” concept. For example:


    - Ask students to pretend they are newspaper reporters describing the
eruption of a volcano or geyser.


    - As reporters they might use as writing anchors the question words _who_,
_what_, _when_, _where_, and _why_ .


**Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**


Materials: Board/chart paper

  - Give students a key unit concept or vocabulary word such as _mantle_ . Have
them brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear the word
(e.g., beneath the crust, very thick, etc.).


  - Record their responses on the board or chart paper.


**Class Book: This Planet Rocks**


Materials: Paper, drawing tools

  - Tell the class or a group of students they are going to make a class book to
help them remember what they have learned so far in this unit.


  - Have students brainstorm important information about features of the
earth’s surface, the layers of the earth, volcanoes, and geysers.


Pausing Point
**69**


**70**




 - Have each student choose one idea to draw a picture of, and then write a
caption for the picture.


 - Bind the pages to make a book to put in the class library for students to read
again and again.


 - You may choose to add more pages upon completion of the entire unit before
binding the book.


**Heat, Pressure, and Time**

 - Teach students a “signal” for each of the words _heat_, _pressure_, and _time_ .


 - For _heat_, have students rub their hands together. Explain that quickly rubbing
their hands together produces a little bit of heat.


 - For _pressur_ e, have students use their hands to press against their thighs. Ask
students if they can feel the pressure on their legs.


 - For _time_, have students say, “tick-tock, tick-tock” to pretend to be a clock.


 - Practice these “signals” until students are comfortable using them.


 - Tell students you are going to say a word. Then, they may give any one of the
three signals as long as they can explain how the signal and the word are
connected. For example:


   - If you say the word _volcano_, one student may give the signal for _heat_ and
say, “Heat makes the magma very hot.”


   - A second student may give the signal for _pressure_ and say, “Pressure
forces the magma to the surface of the earth.”


   - A third student may give the signal for _time_ and say, “It takes a long time
for the magma to make its way to the surface of the earth.”


**Letter to a Geologist**


Materials: Writing paper, writing tools

 - As a class, brainstorm ideas and then write a letter to Gerry or a real
geologist. Students may talk about the cool things that geologists do, or they
may ask questions that they still have about the earth.


 - You may also ask students to write individual letters if they are ready to do
this activity on their own.


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


**Create a Geyser**


Materials: Small plastic bottle with a narrow neck, warm water, liquid
soap, effervescent tablets, large tub or sink


**Note:** This experiment is messy and may be best completed outside.


  - Have student volunteers break the effervescent tablet into small pieces.


  - Put the pieces aside for a few minutes and then fill the bottle about ¾ full
with warm water.


  - Explain to students that the water in a real geyser is extremely hot because
it has been heated by the magma underground, but hot water could cause
burns, so warm water is being used instead.


  - Ask a volunteer to add a few drops of liquid soap to the bottle and to place
the bottle in the tub or sink.


  - Have a student volunteer drop the pieces of effervescent tablet into the
bottle and immediately place their palm firmly over the top of the bottle.


  - Explain to students that when a hand is placed over the bottle, the pressure
in the bottle increases.


  - Have the student release their hand and watch the soap shoot out of
the bottle.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Introducing the Read-Aloud**

 - Bring in cookies that have at least two visible ingredients, such as chocolate
chips, nuts, berries, chocolate candies, etc.


**Note:** Be sure to follow your school’s policy regarding food distribution and
allergies.


**Read-Aloud**

 - Bring in enough table salt to be able to sprinkle some in each student’s hand
for them to taste.


**Application**

 - Prepare the beginning of an idea web on the board or chart paper. In the
center of the board or chart paper, draw a large hexagon and write _Minerals_
inside it. With students, you will draw lines to branch off this center hexagon
to smaller circles with information related to minerals.


 - You may wish to prepare a few sample idea webs in advance to share with
students. You could select familiar topics, such as civilizations or the human
body. See the Activity Book Answer Key at the back of this Teacher Guide for
an example of a completed idea web for Activity Page 5.1.


**Note to Teacher**


Students may be confused about the difference between rocks and minerals.
Rocks are made up of minerals, often several different ones, but minerals are pure
substances that are found in rocks or by themselves in nature. Minerals are the
same all the way through, so we call them a sample or a specimen, not a rock.


**Universal Access**

 - You may wish to gather examples or images of minerals, such as gemstones,
quartz, and crystals.

Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


**Show Image 5A-3: Milky quartz**

Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. All

rocks contain minerals. Sometimes you can

find pure minerals unmixed with other minerals,

but most rocks contain several different

minerals. There are over three thousand

different types of minerals, and scientists still

discover new ones from time to time.



Minerals come in all different shapes, sizes, colors, and textures. We

use these different **characteristics** to divide minerals into groups.

~~_Characteristics are ways to describe and group things._~~ Some of these mineral

groups are quite common, whereas others are very unusual and even difficult

to describe. I will tell you about a few of the best-known minerals.


For instance, this is a picture of the mineral quartz. Quartz is the most

common mineral in the earth’s crust—not the most common in the whole

earth, just the most common mineral in the crust. This picture shows a type

of quartz called milky quartz.


Check for Understanding


**Vocabulary:** What is the crust of the earth? _(the outermost layer_
_of the earth)_


**Show Image 5A-4: Varieties of quartz**

Quartz comes in many varieties. Those are

clear quartz crystals on the top left. ~~_Crystals_~~

~~_are small pieces of minerals that have many_~~

~~_sides and distinct shapes._~~ Some minerals

form into perfect crystals like these, and some





don’t. It all depends on where and how they

are formed within the earth.



Crystals can come in all different sizes. Some are as small as a pea; some are

the size of your arm or longer.


Lesson 5 Minerals
**79**


Support


_Variations_ is related to
the word _vary_, just like
_varies_ is. Students learned
about the word _varies_ in a
previous lesson.


Challenge


Ask students to name
other gemstones they
have heard of.


**80**



As for the color variations in different types of quartz, these are largely

caused by the addition of very small amounts of various types of metals into

the mineral. ~~_Color variations are color differences._~~ For instance, the beautiful

purple color of amethyst is caused by **traces** of iron and aluminum metal.

~~_Traces are very small amounts._~~


**Show Image 5A-5: Ruby and sapphire**

Examples of rare **gemstones** are some

varieties of corundum—a mineral composed

mostly of aluminum and oxygen. ~~_A gemstone_~~

~~_is a stone that is cut and polished to be used_~~

~~_in jewelry. Can you find the gemstones in the_~~









~~_image?_~~ Red corundum is known as ruby, and

blue corundum is known as sapphire. Rubies

and sapphires are among the most beautiful

mineral crystals on earth.


**Show Image 5A-6: Emerald**

Here is another beauty. This is called emerald.

Emerald is a variety of the mineral beryl, which

also comes in many different colors, including

green, blue, yellow, and red. Deep-green

emerald is my favorite. ~~_[Have a student point_~~

~~_to the gemstone.]_~~


**Show Image 5A-7: Diamonds**

And here is one of the most famous minerals.

Do you know what these beauties are called?

~~_[Pause for students to answer.]_~~ These are

diamonds. A diamond is the hardest mineral

in the whole world. A diamond is hard enough

to cut through glass or scratch other minerals.

The diamond on the left is a raw diamond,



fresh from the earth. The diamond on the right has been cut and polished.

The sides of a cut diamond are called facets.


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


**Show Image 5A-8: Jeweler looking at**
**diamond**

You need special equipment and skills to cut

and polish diamonds or other gemstones

such as rubies and emeralds. People who cut

diamonds look through powerful magnifying

glasses as they do their work. This is so they

can see all the tiny little facets, or sides.




~~_[Explain that the inset shows what the jeweler sees through the magnifying_~~

~~_glass.]_~~


**Show Image 5A-9: Salt**

Here is one mineral that we use every day!

Have you ever heard of salt? ~~_[Pause for_~~

~~_students to answer. Sprinkle some table salt_~~

~~_in each student’s hand so that each student_~~

~~_can taste salt.]_~~ Salt, or sodium chloride, is a





common mineral that is found in the oceans

and on Earth. Sodium chloride is called table



salt when we use it in food, and rock salt when we use it to make roads safer

during winter storms.


Some people put table salt on food to make it taste better. In fact, salt is an

extremely important nutrient for people as well as animals. Your body needs

salt—not too much, but just enough. Too much salt is bad for you. If you eat

too much salt, your body will tell you so because you will feel thirsty.


Salt appears in many forms in nature. Rock salt can be found in the form

of halite crystals, like the rectangular-shaped crystal pictured on the left in

the image. You can’t see salt in water because it dissolves, but you’ll know

it’s there if you ever taste ocean water. ~~_When salt mixes with water, the salt_~~

~~_dissolves in the water, or mixes with the water so that no more solid pieces are_~~

~~_visible, to form salt water._~~


Lesson 5 Minerals
**81**


**Show Image 5A-10: Gerry pointing to a**
**blackboard**

Why do all these different minerals look the

way they do? Each has its own story—and it

gets pretty complicated—but you can bet that

there were three basic things in common: ~~_Do_~~

~~_you know what three things Gerry is thinking_~~

~~_of?_~~ heat, pressure, and time. These three

factors play a role in the formation of every

mineral.


**Show Image 5A-11: Gerry with his rock**
**collection**

An important thing to remember about the

rocks you find in nature is that you should

leave them there so that other people can also

enjoy them. Without rocks, environments, ~~_or_~~

~~_natural surroundings_~~ ~~,~~ change dramatically.

If the environment changes, the plants and



**82**



animals that live there might have a hard time finding food and shelter.


Now I’ve told you a bit about some of my favorite minerals. Take a look at the

ground the next time you go outside, and you might actually see something

interesting!


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Inferential.** Why does Gerry the Geologist have so many rocks? _(Gerry the_
_Geologist studies rocks.)_


2. **Literal.** What are minerals? _(Minerals are natural substances found in the_
_earth; they are the building blocks of rocks, or what rocks are made of.)_
Name some of the minerals that you heard about. [You may want to show
images 5A-3–5A-7 and 5A-9 as clues.] _(Some of the minerals were quartz,_
_ruby, sapphire, emerald, diamond, and salt.)_


3. **Literal.** What is a gemstone? _(A gemstone is a stone that is cut and polished_
_to be used in jewelry.)_


4. **Literal.** Where might you find the mineral salt? _(Salt is found in the oceans_
_and in the earth.)_ How is salt used by people? _(Table salt is used to flavor_
_food, and rock salt is used to make roads safer during winter storms._ )


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share:** How are the minerals you heard about similar?
_(Answers may vary but may include that they are found in the_
_earth, they can be useful, etc.)_ How are they different? _(Answers_
_may vary but may include that they are used for different things,_
_they have different appearances, etc.)_


~~**WORD WORK: CHARACTERISTICS (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the Read-Aloud you heard Gerry say, “Minerals come in all different
shapes, sizes, colors, and textures. We use these different characteristics to
divide minerals into groups.”


2. Say the word _characteristics_ with me.


3. _Characteristics_ are ways to describe and group things.


4. Some characteristics of diamonds are that they are colorless and that they
can scratch other minerals. Some characteristics of Gerry the Geologist are
that he has black hair and a mustache, and loves to study rocks.


5. Choose an object in the the room. What are some characteristics that
describe the object you chose? Try to use the word _characteristics_ when you
tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase
students’ responses: “Characteristics of me are . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Discussion activity for follow-up.** Discuss some characteristics
of our school. How could you describe and group people or things in our
school? Be sure to use the word _characteristic(s)_ and answer in complete
sentences.

**Use Evidence:** What did you learn about minerals? _(Answers may_
_vary but may include: they are the building blocks of rocks, or what_
_rocks are made of; they often form crystals; certain kinds can be_
_used for making jewelry; other kinds can be eaten; etc.)_


  - You may wish to record ideas on the board or chart paper as students
describe what they learned about minerals.


  - Model for students how to add an idea to the idea web by taking one of the
things they shared about minerals and adding it to the web. Draw a line from

**Recall:** What three words did Gerry the Geologist say to keep in
mind when thinking about rocks? [Use Image Cards 1–3 as clues.]
_(heat, pressure, and time)_


  - Ask students to share how heat, pressure, and time affect the following
things on the earth:


    - volcanoes _(Answers may vary but may include: heat makes magma very_
_hot; pressure forces the magma to move and causes volcanoes to erupt; it_
_takes a long time for magma to reach the surface of the earth; etc.)_


    - geysers _(Answers may vary but may include: heat makes magma very hot;_
_pressure builds when water seeps in and touches the hot rocks; it takes_
_time for pressure to cause a geyser to release steam and water; etc.)_


    - the layers of the earth _(Answers may vary but may include: as you go_
_deeper in the earth, closer to the core, the mantle gets hotter and the_
_heat causes the rock inside the mantle to move; scientists estimate the_
_inner core is hotter than the sun; pressure makes it harder to dig deeper_
_in the earth with a shovel; the inner core is solid because of the incredible_
_pressure of the earth’s weight pressing inward; over time rocks on the_
_earth’s surface have changed, allowing geologists to better study the_
_earth; etc.)_

 - Preview actions that you would like students to do whenever you say
the following:


   - _igneous rock(s):_ Whenever students hear _igneous rock(s)_, they should hold
up their index finger like it is a candle and pretend to blow out the flame to
demonstrate the heat of fire.


   - _sedimentary rock(s):_ Whenever students hear _sedimentary rock(s)_,
they should repeatedly place one flattened hand on top of the other to
demonstrate the formation of layers over time.

**Show Image 6A-1: Gerry pointing to a**

The right amount of heat can turn a solid rock

or metal into a liquid. ~~_What is the difference_~~

~~_between solid rock and liquid rock? (Solid rock_~~

~~_does not change shape; liquid rock takes on the_~~





~~_shape of its surroundings.)_~~ Pressure from the

weight of the earth and movement of materials



inside the earth can crush rocks. Over time, the effects of heat and pressure

create the rock formations and other geologic phenomena that we find in the

world.


Working together, heat, pressure, and time create the three types of rocks

that exist in the world. Every rock in the world can be placed into one of

three categories. The three types of **rocks** are **igneous**, **sedimentary**, and

**metamorphic** . Try saying each of these rock types out loud: igneous . . .

sedimentary . . . metamorphic. ~~_[Say each word and have students repeat it.]_~~

Lesson 6 The Three Types of Rocks
**91**


**Show Image 6A-2: Granite surface**

The first rock type, igneous, is the most

common. ~~_Remember, whenever you hear_~~

~~igneous rock(s)~~ ~~_, hold up your finger like it is_~~

~~_a candle and pretend to blow out the flame._~~

Igneous rocks come in many forms. Some

form entire mountains, and some appear as

boulders jutting from the earth. This picture



shows a close-up of one type of igneous rock. This plain, old, gray rock

contains different types of minerals, and it hasn’t always been a plain, old,

gray rock.


**Show Image 6A-3: Diagram of magma**
**movement**

The word _igneous_ comes from the Latin word

for fire, because igneous rocks begin deep

down in the heat of the earth’s mantle. ~~_The_~~

~~_word_~~ ~~igneous~~ ~~_sounds similar to the word_~~ ~~ignite~~ ~~_,_~~





~~_which means to light something on fire. Both_~~

~~_come from_~~ ~~ignis~~ ~~_, the Latin word for_~~ ~~_fire. Making_~~



~~_connections between words and roots will help you to learn more words!_~~ As you

have heard, the earth’s mantle is full of a hot, gooey, oozing substance known

as magma, or melted rock. The magma is constantly being forced toward the

surface by pressure from within the earth. As it travels upward from the mantle

through the crust, the magma begins to cool and harden. Sometimes, the

magma will erupt from a volcano, but sometimes, the conditions aren’t quite

right for an eruption. ~~_Over time, heat forms magma, and pressure moves the_~~

~~_magma. When the magma cools, it forms igneous rock._~~


**Show Image 6A-4: Half Dome, Yosemite**
**National Park**

This formation is called Half Dome, and it is

located in Yosemite National Park in California.

When you look at Half Dome, you are looking

at an old magma chamber. A magma chamber





is a pocket, or place, in the earth’s crust where

magma collects. As more magma enters the



**92**



chamber, it gets hotter and pressure builds, and the magma can force its way

up to the surface in the form of a volcano.


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


Or, sometimes, as in the case of Half Dome, the magma just gathers in the

chamber and stays there without erupting. For whatever geologic reason, the

heat and pressure did not get great enough, ~~_or strong enough_~~ ~~,~~ to force the

magma through the crust and onto the surface in the form of lava. Instead,

the magma cooled and hardened within the chamber. Over time, the rocks

and soil around the chamber eroded away, leaving beautiful Half Dome alone,

sticking high up above the earth. Half Dome is certainly a big igneous rock!

~~_Did you hear_~~ ~~igneous rock~~ ~~_? Blow out the fire!_~~


**Show Image 6A-5: Sill**

Another type of igneous formation occurs

when magma intrudes, or pushes itself,

between two existing layers of rock. This

means that not all the layers in this mountain

were formed one on top of the other. Rather,









some of the layers forced their way in between

other rocks.


**Show Image 6A-6: Obsidian**

This is my favorite type of igneous rock:

obsidian, better known as volcanic glass.

Volcanic glass forms when certain types

of lava cool and harden quickly, becoming

smooth, shiny, and glass-like. Only certain

types of lava under certain conditions become

volcanic glass. ~~_Characteristics of volcanic glass_~~

~~_are smooth, shiny, and glass-like._~~


**Show Image 6A-7: Obsidian spearhead**

Some Native Americans used volcanic glass

to make arrowheads and spearheads. If

you break a piece of volcanic glass, you will

find that it is incredibly sharp and strong.

Every now and then I find ancient artifacts,

~~_or objects made by people long ago_~~ ~~,~~ like this

when I’m out rock hunting. ~~_Which type of rock_~~



~~_have you heard about so far: igneous rock, sedimentary rock, or metamorphic_~~

~~_rock? [Prompt students to repeat_~~ ~~igneous rock~~ ~~_in unison and pretend to blow_~~

~~_out the flame.]_~~


Lesson 6 The Three Types of Rocks
**93**


**Show Image 6A-8: Bryce Canyon**

After igneous, the second major rock type is

sedimentary. ~~_Remember, whenever you hear_~~

~~sedimentary rock(s)~~ ~~_, repeatedly place one_~~

~~_flattened hand over the other._~~ Sedimentary

rocks are not formed like igneous rocks, which

form from cooled magma. In fact, heat does

not play much of a role at all in the formation



of sedimentary rocks. Instead, pressure and time are the most important

factors in the formation of sedimentary rocks.


Check for Understanding


**Recall:** Of heat, pressure, and time, which two are the most
important in forming sedimentary rocks? _(pressure and time)_


**Show Image 6A-9: Sediments**

The word **sediments** refers to tiny little

particles, such as dirt or rock, which

are carried along in water, ice, wind, or

landslides. ~~_Do you hear the word_~~ ~~sediment~~

~~_in_~~ ~~sedimentary~~ ~~_?_~~ If you dump a spoonful of





sand into a glass of water, for instance, you

will see the sand gradually sink down and



Support


The word _sink_ also means
a bowl for washing
that has a faucet for
water and a drain at the
bottom, usually found in
kitchens and bathrooms.

refer to Poster 3M in the
Flip Book for multiple
meanings of _sink_ .


**94**



settle on the bottom of the glass, much in the same way that sediments

settle on the bottoms of lakes and oceans. ~~_Here,_~~ ~~sink~~ ~~_means to drop below_~~

~~_the surface of water. [Demonstrate for students how sediments sink to the_~~

~~_bottom by dropping bits of dirt and rock into a glass of water. Have students_~~

~~_watch how the dirt slowly sinks to the bottom of the glass.]_~~ Sediments are

always floating around in lakes, oceans, and rivers. Over time, sediments in

lake water settle and form a thick sludge on the bottom of a lake. As more

and more sediments settle on the bottom, more and more weight presses

down on the sludge. Over time, the pressure from the weight of the upper

sediments can cause the sludge to harden into rock. Through time and

pressure, layers of sediments are turned into sedimentary rock. ~~_How are_~~

~~_sedimentary rocks formed? (Time and pressure turn layers of sediment into_~~

~~_sedimentary rock.) [Prompt students to repeat_~~ ~~sedimentary rock~~ ~~_in unison_~~


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


~~_and repeatedly place their hands one over the other.]_~~


**Show Image 6A-10: Coal**

Coal is a type of sedimentary rock that comes

from decayed plants that have been under

pressure for many years. ~~_Decayed plants are_~~

~~_plants that have died and their remains have_~~

~~_naturally broken down over time and gone_~~





~~_back into the soil._~~ Coal is an important energy

source. People burn coal in order to create



electricity for homes and to make energy to power machines in factories.

People get coal and other important rocks, minerals, and metals by mining

them from the earth. One way to mine coal is by digging a mineshaft, or

tunnel, deep down into the earth.


**Show Image 6A-11: Iron ore**

Another sedimentary rock is called iron **ore** .

Ore is a rock that contains valuable minerals

or metals. There are many different types

of ore in the world, but iron ore is one of the

most important. Iron ore is the source of iron,





a strong metal which is used to make steel.

Steel, in turn, is used to build bridges, cars,



buildings, tools, and other things you see and use every day.


**Show Image 6A-12: Bryce Canyon**

Sandstone is one common type of

sedimentary rock. ~~_Did you hear_~~ ~~sedimentary~~

~~rock~~ ~~_? Make layers of sediments with your_~~

~~_hands!_~~ Wherever you find sandstone, there is

a good chance that you are walking in a place





that used to be completely underwater. At one

time or another, every place on earth has been



completely submerged, in ~~_or covered with_~~ ~~,~~ water. Thus, sandstone is quite

common throughout the world. This photo was taken in Bryce Canyon, in the

state of Utah, which is known for its unique sandstone formations. ~~_[Locate_~~

~~_Utah on a map for students.]_~~


Lesson 6 The Three Types of Rocks
**95**


Challenge


Ask students to explain
what it means when
something erodes.







**Show Image 6A-13: Antelope Canyon**

Here is another sandstone canyon I thought

you would like to see. Antelope Canyon,

in Arizona, is a very special place. ~~_[Locate_~~

~~_Arizona on a map for students.]_~~ It is known as

a slot canyon, which is formed over time as

water from rain and floods rushes through the

sandstone, causing it to erode.


**Show Image 6A-14: Limestone cliffs**

These cliffs are made of limestone, another

type of sedimentary rock. Limestone is

interesting because it is composed mainly of

minerals left over from ancient sea creatures

like clams, oysters, and other shellfish. When

these creatures died, their shells sank down

to the ocean floor and settled with the other



sediments. Over time, the churning oceans ground the shells into a fine white

powder. The powder settled and more shells and sediments put pressure

on it. It took many years, but eventually all the powdery shell leftovers were

compressed into limestone. ~~_Did you hear the words_~~ ~~pressure~~ ~~_and_~~ ~~time~~ ~~_? With_~~

~~_pressure and a long period of time, the shells of sea creatures turned into_~~

~~_sedimentary rock. Which two types of rocks have you learned about so far?_~~

~~_Hint: One is formed by cooled magma and the other is made of sediments._~~


**Show Image 6A-15: Limestone to marble**

If limestone is subjected to intense pressure

and heat for an even longer period of time,

it can turn into another kind of rock called

marble. Marble is very hard, and it often has a

beautiful, pure white color. People have used





marble for thousands of years to make fine

buildings and sculptures.


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks



**96**


Marble is known as a metamorphic rock, which is the third and least common

type of rock. ~~_Remember, whenever you hear_~~ ~~metamorphic rock~~ ~~_, hold out both_~~

~~_hands and then clasp them tightly together._~~ _Metamorphic_ comes from the

Greek word for _transformation_, or change. Metamorphic rocks are formed

when other types of rocks undergo intense heat and pressure and change, or

metamorphose, into new kinds of rocks. ~~_What’s the third type of rock, formed_~~

~~_when heat and pressure change igneous and sedimentary rocks into new_~~

~~_kinds of rocks?_~~


**Show Image 6A-16: Three types of rock**

Congratulations! You are becoming a

geologist! Now you know about the three

rock types: igneous, sedimentary, and

metamorphic. Won’t everyone be impressed

when you tell them about the new words you





learned?



Check for Understanding


**Evaluate an Idea:** Are heat, pressure, and time important in the

2. Say the word _sediments_ with me.


_3. Sediments_ are little tiny pieces of dirt or rock that are moved by wind,
ice, water, or landslides. [You may want to remind students of the quick
experiment you did when you put dirt and rocks in the glass of water.]


4. When you go swimming in a lake, your feet kick up sediments that are on the
bottom of the lake.

word _sediments_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase students’ responses: “I saw sediments in . . . ”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I will describe some objects.
If I describe sediments, say, “Those are sediments.” If I do not describe
sediments, say, “Those are not sediments.”

**Introducing the Read-Aloud**






  - Make a list of topics students have learned about for student pairs to discuss.
Possible topics include rocks (you may wish to have one group for each type
of rock), minerals, volcanoes, geysers, and layers of the earth (you may wish
to have one group for each layer).


**Application**

  - Prepare for students to use available digital tools to produce and publish
their friendly letters.


Lesson 7 Fossils
**103**


**104**



**Notes to Teacher**


You may wish to note for students that Gerry the Geologist studies nonliving
things that are related to the earth: rocks, minerals, volcanoes, and geysers.
Pam the Paleontologist studies evidence of living things that are no longer
living. Plants and animals are living things. Fossils are preserved examples
of those living things that provide clues to what life was like on earth when
those animals and plants were alive.


The purpose of the syntactic awareness activity is to help students
understand the direct connection between grammatical structures and
the meaning of text. The syntactic awareness activity should be used in
conjunction with the complex text presented in the Read-Alouds.


**Universal Access**

 - You may wish to gather images of a variety of fossils and dig sites where
fossils have been found to share with students.

~~**“FOSSILS” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 7A-1: Pam the Paleontologist**

Hi everyone. My name is Pam and I am a

**paleontologist** . ~~_Let’s call her “Pam the_~~

~~_Paleontologist!”_~~ Gerry the Geologist is a friend

of mine. He called me this morning and asked

me to come in and teach you some more about





the earth. He is sorry he can’t be here, but

all this rock-talk has him itching to see some

neat rocks himself, so he is off hiking in the

mountains.



**108**



A paleontologist is a scientist who studies paleontology, which is the study

of plants and animals that lived long ago. Can you say _paleontologist_ ?

Paleontologists study evidence of life, like this bone, to learn about life on

earth long ago. This isn’t just any bone; it’s a dinosaur bone! I’ll be teaching

you about dinosaurs in the near future.


**TEKS 1.7.C** Use text evidence to support an appropriate response; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and texts the student is able
to read or hear to learn or clarify word meanings.


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


**Show Image 7A-2: Sedimentary rock**

Gerry told me that you already know about

basic geologic factors: heat, pressure, and

time. You also know that sedimentary rocks

such as sandstone and limestone are formed

from layers of sediments that have been

pressed together over time. ~~_Sediments can be_~~

~~_tiny pieces of dirt and rock, or even decayed_~~

~~_plants and animals._~~ These layers of sediment



offer many clues about plants and animals that used to be alive. The history

of life on earth is my specialty as a paleontologist.


Check for Understanding


**Use Evidence:** What type of rock do you see in this picture?
_(sedimentary rock)_ How do you know? _(You can see the different_
_layers of sediments that have been pressed together over time.)_


**Show Image 7A-3: Fossilized shell**

Paleontologists need to know a lot about

rocks and geology in order to study evidence

of ancient living things because of something

called a **fossil** . A fossil is the **preserved** body

or imprint of a plant or animal that lived many





years ago. ~~_Let’s look at this image to help us_~~

~~_better understand the meaning of the word_~~



~~preserved.~~ ~~_If something is preserved, it is kept in good condition over a long_~~

~~_period of time._~~ Most fossils, like this fossil of a seashell, show you where the

body of an animal or plant died and was buried under layer after layer of

sediment. Over many years, with more and more sediment pressing down

on it, this shell became part of the stone that formed as a result of geologic

pressure. You are only seeing the **impression**, or shape of it, not the actual

shell. ~~_Think of the shapes you can make when you push an object into clay—_~~

~~_when you remove the object, the shape still remains in the clay!_~~ The creature

itself and its shell decayed and rotted away, but its shape stayed imprinted in

the rock.


Lesson 7 Fossils
**109**


**Show Image 7A-4: Fossil hunter**

As you dig down into the earth, the soil and

rocks are divided into layers. These layers

represent different geologic periods, or times

during which the crust and surface of the

earth changed. For instance, if you find a layer

of sandstone on dry land, then you know that

there may have been an ocean or river over the



Challenge


Have students describe
other timelines they have
worked with (e.g., timeline
of the Maya, Inca, and
Aztec civilizations).


Support


Explain that the
exoskeleton, or hard
outer shell, of trilobites
helped preserve their
remains because it
protected the remains
from wear over time.
Students may recognize
beetles, ants, lobsters,
and scorpions as animals
with exoskeletons.


**110**



land at some point in the distant past. ~~_That means that by examining rocks in_~~

~~_our area, scientists can tell if there used to be an ocean where our city is now_~~

~~_and how long ago that was._~~ We can estimate how old certain fossils may be,

thanks to our understanding of geology and rock layers.


Fossils are usually found in layers of sedimentary rocks, though they can be

found in other rock formations as well. It looks like the paleontologist in this

picture has found a good place for fossil hunting. He has to dig very carefully

to make sure he keeps the fossils in good condition.


Every fossil is part of the earth’s fossil record. The fossil record includes

everything we have learned about the history of life from studying fossils.

The fossil record is what paleontologists study in order to figure out what

life on earth was like many years ago. Paleontologists can estimate when the

animals and plants imprinted in the fossils lived based on the rock layers in

which they were found. They use information from all fossils to propose a

timeline of life on earth. ~~_A timeline of life on earth shows a possible order in_~~

~~_which plants and animals existed, from long ago to today._~~ Today, I would like

to show you several different fossils from different geologic periods on earth.


**Show Image 7A-5: Trilobite**

This is a fossil of a trilobite, an animal that

some scientists think lived long ago. Trilobites

may look like insects, but they are more

closely related to lobsters and crabs. Trilobites

came in many varieties, from a half-inch up





to twenty-eight inches in length. ~~_[Show these_~~

~~_lengths with a ruler or yardstick.]_~~ They had



antennas, lots of legs, and a hard outer shell called an exoskeleton. That

exoskeleton is important because it meant that dead trilobites were easily

fossilized when they became buried in the sand.


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


**Show Image 7A-6:** _**Cooksonia**_ **fossil**

The fossil record estimates that the first plants

appeared on land about the same time. Back

then, there was no soil on the land, because

soil contains dead, decayed plants. Since

these were the first plants on land, no plants

had yet died in order to create soil. The first

plants did not have the same characteristics

as plants today. These plants were less than



half an inch tall and they had no roots, leaves, flowers, or seeds, but they

were plants nevertheless. ~~_[Show the height of less than half an inch with a_~~

~~_ruler or yardstick.]_~~


**Show Image 7A-7: Fish fossils**

Soon came the Age of Fish. Many different

types of fish ruled the waters—types of fish we

don’t see in the waters today.







**Show Image 7A-8: Tetrapod re-creation**

Also during this time, plant and animal life on

land began to spread rapidly. The first soils

developed on land, allowing new types of

plants with leaves, stems, and roots to grow.

With new plants came new land creatures

ready to eat those plants. Tetrapods, the first

amphibians, made their way onto the beaches.



An amphibian is an animal, such as a frog, that lives part of its life in water

and part on land.


Paleontologists have found many tetrapod fossils. An artist drew this picture

using a tetrapod fossil, which shows what a real tetrapod might have looked

like. Do you think any of this tetrapod’s body parts look like they belong to a

fish? ~~_[Pause for students to answer.]_~~


Lesson 7 Fossils
**111**


**Show Image 7A-9: Fern fossil**

Then, lush forests full of trees and plants, such

as ferns, began to grow.


**Show Image 7A-10: First reptiles**

As forests increased, so too did the variety

and sizes of animals. The first giant reptiles

appeared. Of course, the one in this picture—

called a dimetrodon—is just a model that

someone made, but they based this model

on fossilized dimetrodon bones found in

the earth. Paleontologists call the body part



**112**



sticking up on its back a sail because it looks like the sail on a boat.


The dimetrodon was not a dinosaur, but it certainly looked like one, and

dinosaurs were soon to follow. We will learn more about dinosaurs next time.

That is as far as the fossil record will take us today!

#### Introducing the Read-Aloud



10M



**Speaking and Listening:** Students will review how paleontologists and fossils
are related.


~~**TEKS 1.1.C**~~


~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED? (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Review with students that a fossil can be either the preserved body or the
imprint of a plant or animal that lived long ago.


Check for Understanding


**Vocabulary:** What is a paleontologist? _(a scientist who studies_
_living things from long ago by looking at fossils)_


  - Explain that even though paleontologists are interested in the history of life
on Earth, they still need to know a lot about geology in order to estimate how
old fossils are and where they fit in the history of life on Earth.


  - Remind students that the soil and rocks are divided into layers, and that
the layers represent different geologic periods, or times, when changes
happened to the crust of the earth.


  - Tell students that scientists estimate how old certain fossils are based on
their understanding of geology and rock layers.


  - Divide students into four groups. Give each group an Image Card.


  - Have each group discuss what is on the provided Image Card and be
prepared to describe the image to the class.


  - Tell them they will need to identify what the image is, describe details in the
image, and add information recalled from the Read-Aloud related to
the image.


**TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using
the conventions of language.

**Beginning**
Have students use
phrases and familiar
vocabulary to describe
their Image Card.


**Intermediate**
Have students describe
their Image Card using
short sentences.


**Advanced/Advanced High**

Have students describe
their Image Card using
longer, more detailed
sentences.


~~**ELPS 3.H; ELPS 3.J**~~


**122**




- Ask each group to describe their Image Card to the class. For reference, the
Image Cards are as follows:


  - Image Card 10 is a trilobite. It looks like an insect but is more closely
related to lobsters and crabs. They came in many varieties and lengths.
They had antennas, lots of legs, and a hard outer shell called an
exoskeleton.


  - Image Card 11 is a plant fossil _(Cooksonia)_ . There was no soil yet when the
first plants appeared on land because no other plants had died in order to
create soil. These first plants were less than an inch tall and had no roots,
leaves, flowers, or seeds.


  - Image Card 12 is fish fossils. Many types of fish were found in waters on
the earth.


  - Image Card 13 is a fern fossil. Forests full of trees and plants, such as ferns,
began to grow after the first soils developed on land.


- Use the Image Cards to talk about the order in which these living things
inhabited the earth. [The order they are numbered is the order they inhabited
the earth.]

~~**PURPOSE FOR LISTENING**~~


  - Tell students to listen carefully to learn how we know about dinosaurs.


~~**“DINOSAURS” (15 MIN.)**~~


Hey there, fellow scientists! It’s Pam the Paleontologist again. Last time I

was here, I gave you a whirlwind tour of the history of life on Earth right up

through the time of the dimetrodons, the first giant reptiles that had big sails

on their backs. The time when the dimetrodons lived was followed by a time

known as the Age of Reptiles.


**Show Image 8A-1: Tyrannosaurus Rex**
**skeleton**

This is the skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus Rex,

or _T. rex_, as some people call it. It was one of

the largest and most fearsome predators ever





to walk the earth. ~~_A predator is an animal that_~~

~~_eats other animals._~~ We can tell by its teeth that

the _T. rex_ was a meat eater. We also know that



it was over forty feet long and up to twenty feet tall. Judging by the size of

its bones, it weighed about seven tons, or more than two average-sized cars

combined.


**TEKS 1.6.G** Evaluate details to determine what is most important with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.3.B** Use illustrations and texts

**Show Image 8A-2:** _**T. rex**_ **and Triceratops**

~~_How are these two dinosaurs alike, and how are_~~

~~_they different?_~~


This painting shows _T. rex_ facing off against

a triceratops, a dinosaur with long horns and

a shield-like plate on its head. ~~_Here, the word_~~

~~plate~~ ~~_means a flat, hard piece that covers the_~~

~~_bodies of some animals._~~ Keep in mind when



The word _plate_ can also
mean a flat, often round,
dish that food is placed on
for serving or eating.


**124**



you look at artwork like this that nobody today really knows what dinosaurs

looked like. We have only seen their bones and some impressions of their

skin. Artists use information supplied by scientists today to try to make good

guesses about what dinosaurs looked like when they were alive. Scientists do

all this based on dinosaur bones and some impressions of their skin! Many

people think of dinosaurs as giant reptiles, and, in fact, the word _dinosaur_

means “terrifying lizard.” However, many paleontologists now think that

dinosaurs are more closely related to birds than they are to lizards. Whatever

the case may be, there are no dinosaurs on Earth anymore. They have all

been **extinct** —dead and gone—for many years. Now there are just fossilized

bones of dinosaurs buried in the earth’s crust.


Check for Understanding


**Thumbs-Up/Thumbs-Down:** If something is extinct, is it around
today? _(no; thumbs-down)_


**Show Image 8A-3: Stegosaurus**

~~_How would you describe this dinosaur?_~~


Here is my personal favorite: the stegosaurus.

Like the triceratops, the stegosaurus was





an herbivore, or plant eater, but it had some

pretty good ways of defending itself against

meat eaters. Stegosaurus had hard, sharp

plates on its back, which would have made



it difficult to bite. But just in case anyone tried, the stegosaurus also had a

spiky tail that could really do some damage.


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


**Show Image 8A-4: Excavating dinosaur**
**bones**

How do we find and learn about these

incredible animals? Scientists look for their

fossilized bones, which can be found in many

parts of the world, including the United

States. ~~_If something is fossilized, that means_~~

~~_over a long period of time it came to be like a_~~


bones is not as easy as you might think.


Once paleontologists find an area that is likely to have dinosaur bones, we

move in with our tools and begin careful excavation. Paleontologists must

use sharp little knives and small brushes to gradually scrape away the

sedimentary rock surrounding the fossils. It will take this paleontologist days

and maybe even weeks to excavate this one bone. It’s slow work, but to me

there is nothing more exciting in the world than carefully uncovering a bone

that may teach us about life long ago.


**Show Image 8A-5: Large excavation**

Here a paleontologist is excavating a large

collection of bones from the sandstone cliffs of

Dinosaur National Monument, an area located

in the states of Colorado and Utah, where we

have uncovered hundreds and thousands of

dinosaur bones. ~~_[Locate Colorado and Utah on_~~

~~_a U.S. map for students.]_~~



Can you see all the bones in this picture? That was one big dinosaur! But

what did it really look like? It’s hard to tell because, over time, the bones have

moved around and become broken. As a paleontologist, I sometimes feel

like I spend half my life putting puzzles together. Often we only find a few

bones—the rest of the skeleton was long since destroyed or perhaps even

dragged away by a predator many years ago. Other times, lots of different

dinosaur bones can be mixed in together. We paleontologists have to use our

detective skills to figure out which bones belonged to which type of dinosaur.


Lesson 8 Dinosaurs
**125**


**Show Image 8A-6: Excavating** _**Camarasaurus**_

In fact, those bones belonged to a mighty

_Camarasaurus_ . I knew as soon as I saw its

head. This plant eater was sixty feet long and

weighed about twenty tons. A real whopper!

~~_A ton is a unit of weight equal to 2,000 pounds._~~

~~_That means this dinosaur weighed the same_~~

~~_amount as 10 cars when it was alive! [Show_~~



~~_students a yardstick and tell them that this dinosaur was as long as twenty_~~

~~_yardsticks.]_~~


**Show Image 8A-7:** _**Camarasaurus**_

Here is one artist’s idea of what the

_Camarasaurus_ looked like. It could use its long

tail to fend off predators. Good thing you don’t

have to worry about these things anymore!







**Show Image 8A-8:** _**Compsognathus**_

~~_How would you describe this dinosaur?_~~


Not all dinosaurs were huge. In fact, some

were really small. Take the _Compsognathus_ .

This little critter stood just two feet tall and

scurried around on two little bird-like legs.

~~_Two feet is less than the length of one_~~



~~_yardstick._~~ _Compsognathus_ was a meat eater that fed on little lizards. We

know this because paleontologists found parts of a fossilized lizard in the

stomach cavity of a _Compsognathus_ fossil.


**Show Image 8A-9:** _**Tyrannosaurus rex**_ **skeleton**

What happened to the dinosaurs? You can’t go

and see a live _T. rex_ today at the zoo because

dinosaurs are extinct. ~~_Remember, extinct_~~

~~_means that there are no more left._~~ According to

fossil records, the extinction of the dinosaurs





was quite sudden. Why? That’s something

paleontologists have been trying to answer



**126**



ever since the first dinosaur bones were discovered and identified nearly two

hundred years ago.


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


**Show Image 8A-10: Meteor**

For years, many scientists thought that

extraordinary geologic events, such as super

volcanoes, must have had something to do

with it. These days, however, many scientists

now think that the dinosaur extinction was

caused by a giant **meteorite** from outer

space. ~~_A meteorite is a piece of rock that falls_~~



~~_from space to the earth’s surface._~~ There are billions of **meteors**, or burning

chunks of **debris** in outer space. Some meteors are quite large, but most are

tiny, between the size of a sand grain and a baseball. Meteors are whizzing

around all over the place in outer space. Occasionally, a meteor crashes

toward Earth. When this happens, the meteor hits the atmosphere at an

incredible speed and usually burns up as it enters the uppermost parts of

Earth’s atmosphere. ~~_[Remind students that they learned in the_~~ ~~Astronomy:~~

~~Space Exploration~~ ~~_unit that this burning up of meteors creates a streak of_~~

~~_light in the night sky that some people think is a shooting star.]_~~ Occasionally,

bits and pieces of meteors survive their trip through the atmosphere and

actually fall to earth. This is very rare, but it does happen from time to time,

and it is possible to find pieces of them on the ground. When part of a meteor

survives the trip through the atmosphere and lands on Earth, the meteor

becomes a meteorite, or space rock that has landed on Earth.


**Show Image 8A-11: Recovered meteorite**

Now, let’s go back to dinosaur extinction.

Some scientists think that the dinosaur

extinction was caused by a giant meteorite

from outer space. When the meteorite struck

the earth, it sent massive plumes, ~~_or clouds_~~ ~~,~~





of debris up into the atmosphere. ~~_That means_~~

~~_it sent large amounts of bits and pieces of_~~



~~_objects from the earth up into the atmosphere._~~ This debris would have

blocked out the light and energy of the sun, causing much of Earth’s plant

life to die and severely lowering the temperature. Most creatures at the time

would have been unable to adapt, and they would have died out before the

skies had a chance to clear.

Whether this is true or not remains to be seen, though geologists have

discovered at least one very large crater that was caused by a meteorite

impact about the time the dinosaurs became extinct. Whatever the case,

we know that dinosaurs became extinct, making way for new kinds of life on

Earth. I, for one, will continue to study the earth’s fossil record, and I am sure

we will find the answer some day, because the clues about how the dinosaurs

died are all there in the rocks. Ask my friend Gerry the Geologist, and he will

tell you the same thing!

_dinosaurs because of the work of scientists. They dig for fossils and_
_examine fossilized dinosaur bones. They use that evidence to try and_
_recreate what dinosaurs looked like and to help with understanding_
_how and where dinosaurs lived and how they died.)_


1. **Literal.** What does it mean when someone says that dinosaurs are extinct?
_(When someone says that dinosaurs are extinct, it means that there are no_
_living dinosaurs left.)_ How do we know anything about dinosaurs if they are
extinct? _(Paleontologists have found and studied fossilized dinosaur bones.)_


2. **Inferential.** Do we know what dinosaurs really looked like? _(No, we do not_
_know what dinosaurs really looked like.)_ Why not? _(Dinosaurs are extinct._
_They lived many years ago, and only their bones have been found.)_

   - **Inferential.** How can we guess what dinosaurs looked like?
_(Paleontologists use excavated dinosaur bones to try and determine what_
_many dinosaurs may have looked like.)_

2. Say the word _extinct_ with me.


3. If a plant or an animal is _extinct_, there are none living or left on the earth.


4. Some animals are protected so that they don’t become extinct.


5. Are there some animals that you think are in danger of becoming extinct?
What can we do to protect animals today from becoming extinct? Try to
use the word _extinct_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If
necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses: “We can protect
animals today from becoming extinct by . . .”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Discussion activity for follow-up.** Think about how the earth today
may be different if dinosaurs were not extinct. How would the work of
paleontologists and geologists be the same or different from what they do
now? How might your life be different if dinosaurs were not extinct? Be sure
to use the word _extinct_ and answer in complete sentences.

_dinosaurs_, _Earth’s layers_, _rocks, minerals_, or _volcano/geyser_ .


 - Divide students into five groups. Give each group an idea web.


 - Have students brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear the
word on the center of their idea web.


 - Have them record their responses on the chart, using the sound–spelling
correspondences they know so far.


 - When all the groups are finished, have each group present their web,
explaining the topic and the information they added.


 - Have students add any new details suggested by other groups.


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


**Rock Sort**


Materials: Paper folded into four sections, drawing tools, bins with
labels for sorting rocks, four different kinds of small/medium-sized
rocks for each student


**Note:** This activity can also be completed in partners or small groups.


  - Give each student or group four small/medium-sized rocks of different types.


  - Have students use their senses of touch and sight to describe their rocks
to partners. Prompt students to use descriptive vocabulary, if applicable, as
they describe their rocks: _smooth_, _rough_, _shiny_, _dull_, _striped_, _-colored_,
etc.


  - Next, have students fold a piece of paper in half once and then in half again,
creating four squares/rectangles.


  - Have students draw each rock (including identifying characteristics)
and write a sentence describing the rock using the sound–spelling
correspondences taught so far.


  - After students have finished drawing and coloring their rocks, tell students
that they are going to sort their rocks as a class.


  - Place different-colored bins around the classroom and label them with the
most common words used to describe students’ rocks, such as _smooth_,
_rough_, _shiny_, _dull_, _striped_, _-colored_, etc.


  - Tell students that you are going to name a characteristic of rocks, or a
way to describe them. If students have a rock that matches the named
characteristic, they should raise it into the air. Confirm that all raised rocks
match the named characteristic. Students should then place their rocks into
the appropriate bin for that named characteristic.


  - Repeat this process until all rocks have been sorted into the correct bin.


  - Have students share with their neighbors and with the class how they
described each rock and determined in which bin to place each rock.
Students can also discuss the similarities and differences they observed
among rocks.


  - After the rocks have been sorted, students can then compare the rocks
within each bin to determine which rock has the most or least of the
characteristics within the sorted group.

#### Unit Assessment


This Unit Assessment evaluates each student’s retention of unit and
academic vocabulary words and the core content targeted in _This Planet_
_Rocks_ . The results should guide review and remediation the following day.


There are three parts to this assessment. You may choose to do the
parts in more than one sitting if you feel this is more appropriate for your
students. Part I (Vocabulary Assessment) is divided into two sections: the
first assesses unit-related vocabulary and the second assesses academic
vocabulary. Parts II and III of the assessment address the core content
targeted in _This Planet Rocks_ .

#### Culminating Activities


~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


Please use these final two days to address class results of the Unit Assessment.
Based on the results of the Unit Assessment, you may wish to use this class time
to provide remediation opportunities that target specific areas of weakness for
individual students, small groups, or the whole class.


Alternatively, you may also choose to use this class time to extend or enrich
students’ experiences with unit knowledge. A number of enrichment activities are
provided below in order to provide students with opportunities to enliven their
experiences with unit concepts.


~~**REMEDIATION**~~


You may choose to regroup students according to particular area of weakness, as
indicated from Unit Assessment results.


Remediation opportunities include:


  - targeting Review activities


  - revisiting lesson Applications


  - rereading and discussing select Read-Alouds


  - using the corresponding activities in the Language Studio


~~**ENRICHMENT**~~


**Image Review**

  - Show the Flip Book images from any Read-Aloud again and have students
retell the Read-Aloud using the images.


**Image Card Review**


Materials: Image Cards 10–14

  - Divide the class into six groups. Give each group one of the Image Cards.


  - Give the groups a few minutes to brainstorm everything they remember
about the Image Card.


  - Then come together as a class and give each group a chance to share.



Image Cards 10–14



Culminating Activities
**141**


**142**



**Unit-Related Trade Book or Student Choice**


Materials: Trade book

 - Read an additional trade book to review fossils or dinosaurs.


 - You may also choose to have students select a Read-Aloud to be heard again.


**Fossil Museum**


Materials: Homemade fossils (see following recipe), writing tools,
index cards


**Note:** The following dough recipe will produce approximately eight fossils
the size of a saucer. The fossils need time to dry so have students help
you make the fossils one day, allowing them to dry overnight for use in the
activity the following day.


**Note:** Be sure to check your school’s policy regarding food distribution and
allergies.


~~**PART I**~~


 - Make the fossils with students using the following recipe.


 - Allow the fossils to dry overnight


Model Fossil Recipe:


   - Make dough by combining 1 cup wet, used coffee grounds, ½ cup cold
coffee, 1/2 cup salt, and 1 1/3 cups flour in a medium-sized bowl.

   - Have students mix these ingredients together until mix resembles
modeling dough. Add more flour if dough is sticky.


   - Have students place a leaf, toy insect, and shell on the wax paper. The
object can be face up or face down. The wax paper represents the ground.


   - Have students flatten out a “layer of sediment” by flattening the ball
of dough and laying it on top of the “organism.” This represents the
organisms being buried by sediment.


   - Students can repeat this step a few times to represent time passing. Then
students can remove the “organism” to represent the decay and see the
impression left.


   - Allow the fossils to dry overnight on a wire rack.


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks


~~**PART II**~~


 - Gather all the fossils together and count the total number of fossils.


 - Divide students into groups based on the number of fossils. Each group should
have at least one fossil.


 - Discuss the characteristics of fossils with students. _(Most fossils form after a_
_plant or animal is buried under layers of sediment. Pressure on the sediment_
_preserves the body or imprint of the plant or animal, leaving a fossil.)_


 - Explain to students that they are going to examine and label the fossils and
then make a fossil display.


 - Give each group writing tools and index cards. Ask the group to look closely at
their fossil and to determine if it is a plant or an animal fossil.


 - Have each group write a label for each of their fossils, using the sound–spelling
correspondences taught thus far.


 - Ask students how the fossil display should be organized (e.g., plant fossils and
animal fossils). Make index card labels for the categories, and place them on a
tabletop or clear surface.


 - Invite students to display their fossils and the corresponding labels in the
“museum.”


 - Spend a few minutes observing the fossils as a class. Ask students questions
to provoke their thinking and help them relate this activity to the Read-Aloud
material. Suggested questions include the following:


   - Which category has the most fossils?


   - If these fossils were real, what would they tell us about animals and plants
that are no longer living?


   - Compare and contrast the fossils. How are they similar? How are they
different?


**Syntactic Awareness Video: Conjunction Junction**

 - Show students the Schoolhouse Rock! “Conjunction Junction” video, widely
available on a number of teaching websites.


**Rock and Mineral Collections**

 - If your school has a rock or mineral collection, you may want to share it with
your class.


 - If feasible, you may invite students to bring in interesting rocks to share with
the class.


Culminating Activities
**143**


Image Cards 1–3



**Class Book: This Planet Rocks**


Materials: Paper, drawing tools

 - Tell the class or a group of students that they are going to make a class book
to help them remember what they have learned in this unit.


 - Have students brainstorm important information about fossils, dinosaurs,
and paleontologists.


 - Have each student choose one idea, draw a picture of it, and then write a
caption for it.


 - Bind the pages to make a book to put in the class library for students to read
again and again.


**Heat, Pressure, and Time**


Materials: Image Cards 1–3

 - Give three students the Image Cards for heat, pressure, and time. Review
what the Image Cards represent.


 - Have the three students stand in various locations around the room.


 - Tell the class that you are going to say a word. They will decide how heat,
pressure, or time are connected to the word, and then walk to and stand with
the person holding that Image Card. After the students have walked to the
various locations, have them explain how the two words are connected. For
example, if you say the word fossil, one student may walk to the Image Card
of “pressure” and say, “It takes pressure to form a fossil.” A second student
may walk to the Image Card of “time” and say, “It takes a very long time for a
fossil to form.”


 - Another variation is to use the signals explained in the Pausing Point.


**Letter to a Geologist or Paleontologist**


Materials: Writing paper, writing tools

 - As a class, brainstorm ideas and then write a letter to Gerry, a real geologist,
Pam, or a real paleontologist. Students may talk about the cool things that
geologists or paleontologists do or ask questions that they still have about
the earth.


 - You may also ask students to write individual letters if they are ready to do
this activity on their own.


Unit 5 This Planet Rocks



**144**


**Volcano Camera**


Materials: Website: http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/cams/

  - Visit the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory’s volcano cameras to obtain
firsthand views of the Mauna Loa or Kilauea volcanoes of Hawaii.


**Lava in a Cup**


Materials (per student or small group): Clear plastic drinking cup, ¼ cup
vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon of salt, water, food coloring (optional)


**Note:** Be sure to check your school’s policy regarding food distribution and
allergies


  - Ask students to explain the difference between lava and magma. If
necessary, remind them that magma is hot, molten rock under the surface of
the earth, and lava is magma that has erupted from a volcano and has come
out onto the surface of the earth.


  - Explain to students that they are going to make a model of lava.


  - Give each student, partner pair or group a cup.


  - Fill the cups 3/4 full with water.


  - Add 5 drops of food coloring [optional].


  - Add 1/4 cup vegetable oil to each cup.


  - Sprinkle 1 teaspoon salt on top of the water.


  - Watch the lava move up and down in the cup.


  - Add additional salt to keep the lava moving.


  - Have students describe what they observe.


**Forming Three Types of Rocks**


Materials: Chips in different colors (chocolate or peanut butter;
alternately, you can use crayon shavings instead), stove or hot plate
(optional), aluminum foil, pan of hot water, plastic bags, clear jar


Culminating Activities
**145**


**146**



**Note:** This activity requires adult supervision, and you may desire the
assistance of parents or a teacher’s aide. Also, this activity can be completed
with crayon shavings instead of chocolate chips. In addition, be sure to follow
your school’s policy regarding food distribution and allergies. Please follow
your district’s science safety protocols to exercise caution when completing the
activity with your class.


 - Review with students the three types of rocks and how each is formed.


 - Tell students that you are going to use different-colored chips (white
chocolate chips, semi-sweet chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, etc.) to
model how each type of rock is formed, using heat, pressure, and time.


 - To create igneous rocks, melt one color of the chips, either via stove/ hot
plate or by placing the chips on aluminum foil in a pan of very hot water.
Allow the melted chips to cool. Note: For safety purposes, the teacher (or
other adult) should be the only one who actually melts the chips. The teacher
(or other adult) should be the only one with control of and access to the hot
plate/stove as students observe this portion of the activity.


 - Tell students that igneous rocks are formed from magma (melted rock) that
has been heated and then cooled, similar to how these chocolate chips have
been melted and then cooled.


 - To create sedimentary rocks, place each color of chocolate chips into separate
plastic bags. Students can crush these chips using their feet or hands.


 - Next, layer each color of crushed chips into a clear jar. Have students help
you press down on these layers using their hands or feet to simulate the
formation of sedimentary rocks.


 - Remind students that metamorphic rocks are rocks that undergo extreme
amounts of heat and pressure.


 - To create metamorphic rocks, first layer each color of crushed chocolate
chips onto a piece of aluminum foil.


 - Next, have students apply pressure to the layers using hands or feet. Place
the pressed layers on aluminum foil in a pan of very hot water to melt the
layers. Allow the melted layers to cool.


 - Tell students that metamorphic rocks have undergone intense heat and
pressure, similar to how these chips have been layered, pressed together,
melted, and then cooled.


 - Lead students in a discussion of how each type of “rock” was formed, using
heat, pressure, and/or time.
