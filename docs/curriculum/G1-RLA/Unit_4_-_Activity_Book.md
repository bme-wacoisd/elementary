Dear Family Member,


##### 1.3 Take-Home



Over the next few weeks, your student will be learning about astronomy. Your student
will learn about the sun, the moon, the stars, and the eight planets in our solar system.
Your student will also learn about space exploration, including the first astronauts to land
on the moon.


In the next few days, we will focus our study of astronomy on the sun, the moon, and
the stars. The most powerful way you can help support your student’s learning about
astronomy is to take them outside to observe the sky. Below are some suggestions for
ways you can make their study of astronomy even more meaningful and fun, and some
words your student is learning that relate to each activity.


1. Sunrise or Sunset


Your student is learning that the earth orbits or revolves around the sun. Your student
is also learning that even though it looks like the sun moves across the sky each day, it
is actually the earth spinning on its axis that causes day and night. Go outside with your
student at dawn to observe the sunrise, or at dusk to observe the sunset.


Words to use: dusk, dawn, atmosphere, revolve, horizon


2. Stargazing


In a few days your student will learn about the stars and the constellations. Take your
student out in the evening to observe the stars. The Big and Little Dipper are part of
the Big Bear constellation. Your student will learn to recognize the dippers and Polaris
(the North Star). Together with your student, try to identify these groups of stars in the
night sky. You may wish to obtain a book from the library on constellations to guide your
observations.


Words to use: constellation, star, telescope, outer space, meteor


3. Phases of the Moon


Your student will learn about the moon and how it orbits the earth, reflecting the
sun’s light. Your student will also learn to recognize four of its phases: the new moon, the
crescent moon, the half moon, and the full moon. Look for the moon every few days and
talk with your student about how much of it is visible in the sky.


Words to use: crescent, full, reflecting, orbit, craters, man in the moon

4. Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read to your student each day. The local library has many
books on astronomy and a list of books and other resources relevant to this topic.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they have
been learning at school.

Dear Family Member,


##### 6.2 Take-Home



Over the next few days, your student will be continuing their study of astronomy. Your
student has now learned about the sun and the stars, and has begun to learn about the
moon. In the next few days, our class will focus our study on space exploration and the
planets in the solar system. The most powerful way you can help support your student’s
learning about astronomy is to continue taking them outside to observe the sky. Below
are some additional suggestions for activities, and some words your student is or will be
learning that relate to each activity.


1. Name the Planets


Your student will be learning about the eight planets in our solar system: Mercury,
Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Your student will also learn that
Pluto was once considered a planet, but in 2006 was categorized as a dwarf planet. When
you were in school, you may have learned a mnemonic to remember the names of the
(then) nine planets, such as “My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas.” Write
a new mnemonic with your student to help them remember the list of eight names above.


2. Make a Model


Work with your student to use play dough or modeling clay to create models of the
sun and the planets. Lay the models on a black piece of paper, and draw chalk lines to
represent orbits. Alternatively, work with your student to paint or draw a diagram of the
solar system on a piece of paper.


3. Planet Earth


Your student has learned that our home, Earth, is a planet that it is in constant motion.
It is difficult to believe that we are living on a moving sphere when the land beneath our
feet seems still and flat. Explore a globe with your student and help them understand that
it represents the planet Earth. Locate the United States and other countries your student
knows about. Observe how much of the planet is covered by the continents and how much
is covered by the oceans.


4. Astronauts for a Day


Your student will learn about spacecraft and astronauts in the coming days. If the
thought of space travel captures your student’s imagination, pretend to be astronauts

together. Dress up in spacesuits and helmets. Using furniture or boxes, assemble a
spacecraft. Countdown to launch, hurtle through space propelled by a rocket, and pretend
to land on the moon or another planet.


5. Read Aloud Each Day


It is very important that you read to your student each day. Many books can be found
at the local library related to astronomy.


Be sure to let your student know how much you enjoy hearing about what they have
been learning at school.
