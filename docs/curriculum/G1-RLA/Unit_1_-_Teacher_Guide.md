#### Introduction


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching the _Sharing_
_Stories_ unit. The Teacher Guide for _Sharing Stories_ contains nine daily lessons in addition to two
days for a Pausing Points (one day, each), Unit Review, Unit Assessment, and Culminating Activities
(four days) in the order presented in this Teacher Guide. You should spend no more than fifteen days
total on this unit. Work with district and/or school leadership to accommodate the implementation
of this unit alongside any required beginning of year testing.

Introduction

~~**WHY SHARING STORIES IS IMPORTANT**~~


This unit will introduce students to stories in the form of fables, folktales, and parables that
have delighted generations of people. By listening to these classics, students will increase their
vocabulary and reading comprehension skills, learn valuable lessons about ethics and behavior,
become familiar with the key elements and parts of a story, and acquire cultural literacy. For
example, a student who has listened to “The Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing” in this grade will be prepared
to later understand a newspaper story that characterizes someone as “a wolf in sheep’s clothing.”


In the first six Read-Alouds of the Teacher Guide, students will listen to some well-known Aesop’s
fables. Fables are special types of fiction that teach morals or important lessons. Listening to fables
such as “The Boy Who Cried Wolf,” “The Goose and the Golden Eggs,” and “The Fox and the Grapes”
will help students learn the elements of this genre. Aesop lived in ancient Greece and was known as a
man of strong religious conviction who followed the polytheism and gods of the Greeks. For centuries,
the ethics reinforced in these fables have become universally recognized.


In the next two Read-Alouds, students will be introduced to two classic folktales that are also
interwoven with morals. “The Tale of Peter Rabbit” is a more modern popular folktale from Great
Britain, and like Aesop’s fables, comes with a moral. “The Little Half-Chick (Medio Pollito)” is a
popular Spanish pourquoi story, a kind of folktale that provides a fictional telling of why things are
the way they are, and also reinforces a moral for readers. Reading these folktales will help first-grade
students develop a strong foundation for the understanding and enjoyment of fiction, which often
teaches moral lessons that apply to behavior in the real world.


The unit closes with a popular parable. Much like Aesop’s fables, this parable is ancient and was
part of a collection of writings that is religious in nature. While Aesop’s fables originated in the
polytheism of ancient Greece, this parable is part of the New Testament from the Christian Bible.
But also like Aesop’s fables, this parable features both morals and idioms that are referenced
widely in modern society, beyond any religious context. For example, a student who has listened to
“The Parable of the Prodigal Son” in this grade will be prepared later to understand references to a
prodigal son returning in movies, sports broadcasts, music, novels, and more.


The text that students will be listening to and discussing provides opportunities for students to build
content knowledge and draw connections to social studies. You may build on class discussions to
support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strand of Culture and Geography from
the Social Studies TEKS. For more information on using religious source material in reading/language
arts, consult the program guide.


Unit 1 Sharing Stories


Previewing all Read-Alouds and lessons in this domain before presenting them to students will help
in identifying any of these cross-curricular connections. For information about the quantitative
and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text
Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


~~**WHAT STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY LEARNED**~~


The following units, and the specific core content that was targeted in those units, are particularly
relevant to the Read-Alouds students will hear in _Sharing Stories_ :


**Nursery Rhymes and Fables (Kindergarten)**


**Fairy Tales and Folktales (Kindergarten)**


~~**CORE VOCABULARY FOR SHARING STORIES**~~


The following list contains all of the core vocabulary words in _Sharing Stories_ in the forms in which
they appear in the Read-Alouds or, in some instances, in the “Introducing the Read-Aloud” section at
the beginning of the lesson. Bold-faced words in the list have an associated Word Work activity. The
inclusion of the words on this list does not mean that students are immediately expected to be able
to use all of these words on their own. However, through repeated exposure throughout the lessons,
they should acquire a good understanding of most of these words and begin to use some of them in
conversation.

Unit 1 Sharing Stories


~~**WRITING**~~


In this unit, students will explore the genre of narrative writing. They will learn to identify important
elements of stories before, during, and after informational Read-Alouds. They will practice planning
for narrative writing by note-taking as a group with a Story Map, Personification Chart, and
Somebody Wanted But So Then organizer. Students will work independently to draw and write or
dictate one-sentence retellings of Read-Alouds in Lessons 3 and 6. Finally, as a class, students will
review the writing process and draft a narrative retelling of “The Tale of Peter Rabbit” (Lesson 7).


The following activities may be added to students’ writing portfolios to showcase student writing
within and across units:


  - Write About It (Lessons 3 and 6)


  - any additional writing completed during the Pausing Point, Unit Review, or Culminating Activities


~~**FOUNDATIONAL ORAL LANGUAGE**~~


Across the unit and the grade level, students will have the opportunity to discuss their ideas with
partners, in small groups, and as a class. The Think-Pair-Share and Turn and Talk prompts provide
opportunities to teach and reinforce how to communicate by using conventions of language,
speaking when recognized, and making appropriate contributions to discussion.


 - You can also reinforce these ideas by modeling using an appropriate pace, recognizing students’
individual contributions to group discussions, and pointing out conventions of language.


 - Explain to students that when working in whole/small groups, group members share
responsibility for the work they do together. To work effectively and respectfully, everyone should
recognize the contributions made by each group member. For example, as group members
discuss a text, each group member can share thoughts and reactions. If preparing to return
to a whole-group discussion, group members can summarize the group’s ideas by including
contributions from everyone in the group.


 - Practice this by choosing a simple topic for discussion, and model sharing responsibility and
recognizing individual and appropriate contributions, including hand-raising when wanting to
speak and using learned conventions for language (articulation, grammar, verb tenses, etc.)
Remind students what these contributions and conventions refer to in terms of speech and
communication and why they are important to master. Consider using a discussion checklist
that tracks student participation, as well as introducing discussion techniques that enhance
participation.


~~**TEKS 1.1.C; TEKS 1.1.D**~~


**TEKS 1.1.C** Share information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using the conventions of language;
**TEKS 1.1.D** Work collaboratively with others by following agreed-upon rules for discussion, including listening to others, speaking when recognized, and making
appropriate contributions.

The men ran to meet him, and after they found out there was no wolf after

all, one man remained to talk with the boy awhile. ~~_If there really wasn’t a wolf,_~~

~~_why would the boy cry out, “Wolf! Wolf!”?_~~


The boy enjoyed the company so much that a few days later he tried the

same **prank** again, and again the men ran to help him. ~~_A prank is a trick. Why_~~

~~_does the shepherd boy play the prank again?_~~


A few days later, a real wolf came from the forest and began to steal the

sheep. The **startled**, ~~_or surprised_~~, boy ran toward the valley, and more loudly

than ever he cried, “Wolf! Wolf!” ~~_Do you think the men and women will come_~~

~~_and help the shepherd boy? Why or why not?_~~


But the men and women, who had been fooled twice before, thought that

the boy was tricking them again. So no one came to help the boy save his

sheep. ~~_How do you think the shepherd boy feels now?_~~


_Moral: If you often don’t tell the truth, people won’t believe you even when you_

_are telling the truth._ ~~_[Have students echo the moral and then discuss its meaning._~~

~~_Remind students that this Read-Aloud was short because fables are short.]_~~


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS (15 MIN.)**~~


Ask students to recall the title of this fable. Write it on the Story Map. As
students answer the following questions, record relevant information on the
Story Map. Note: You may display images as well as text in the Story Map to
support students. If students give one-word answers and/or fail to use ReadAloud or unit vocabulary in their responses, acknowledge correct responses
by expanding students’ responses, using richer and more complex language.
Ask students to answer in complete sentences by having them restate the
question in their responses.


1. **Inferential.** Is this a true story or is it make-believe? _(make-believe)_


2. **Evaluative.** What elements of this story make it a make-believe, or fiction,
story? _(Answers may vary but may include that it was made up to teach a_
_lesson.)_


3. **Inferential.** The people or animals in a story are called the characters of the
story. Who are the characters in “The Boy Who Cried Wolf”? _(shepherd boy,_
_men, sheep, wolf)_


4. **Evaluative.** The setting of a story is where it takes place. What is the setting
of this fable? ( _a field at the foot of the mountain near a dark forest_ ) Could
this fable have taken place in a different setting? _(Answers may vary but may_
_include that the setting would have to include a field for the sheep.)_


5. **Literal.** What is the shepherd boy doing at the beginning of the fable?
_(tending his sheep)_ How does he feel? _(lonely)_


Unit 1 Sharing Stories


    - **Literal.** What does the boy decide to do because he is lonely? _(pretends_
_that he sees a wolf to get company)_ What happens at the end when a wolf
really comes? _(No one comes to help because they think the shepherd boy_
_is tricking them again.)_


**Show Image 1A-1: Shepherd boy chuckling**

    - **Evaluative.** The beginning, middle, and end events of a story are called
the plot of the story. Does this illustration depict the beginning, middle, or
end of the fable? How do you know? _(the middle, because the boy is calling_
_for help, but there is no wolf)_


6. **Literal.** All of Aesop’s fables, or stories, were meant to teach a moral, or a
lesson, about how to behave. What is the moral of this fable? _(If you often_
_lie, people won’t believe you even when you are telling the truth.)_ [Accept
paraphrasing by students, e.g., “Don’t lie.”]

    - **Evaluative.** Is this an important lesson for you to remember? Why or why
not? _(Yes, because people shouldn’t tell lies.)_


[Think-Pair-Share activities encourage students’ active involvement in
class discussions by having them think through their answers to questions,
rehearse their responses silently and through discussion with a peer, and
share their responses aloud with the class. Model sharing responsibility and
recognizing contributions, including hand-raising when wanting to speak and
using learned conventions for language (articulation, grammar, verb tenses,
etc.). Remind students why these conventions are important to master.
Consider using a discussion checklist that tracks student participation, as
well as introducing discussion techniques that enhance participation.

~~**TEKS 1.1.B; TEKS 1.1.C; TEKS 1.1.D**~~


In Think-Pair-Share activities, you will begin by asking students to listen
to the question you pose. You will then allow students some time to think
about the question and their response to the question. Next, you will prompt
students to discuss their response in pairs. Finally, you will select several
students to share their responses with the class. Model pointing out how
students each contributed to the discussion by building on the ideas of
others. Directions to students are as follows.]


**TEKS 1.1.B** Follow, restate, and give oral instructions that involve a short, related sequence of actions; **TEKS 1.1.C** Share
information and ideas about the topic under discussion, speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and using the conventions
of language; **TEKS 1.1.D** Work collaboratively with others by following agreed-upon rules for discussion, including listening to
others, speaking when recognized, and making appropriate contributions.

discussed with your partner. Remember to use proper language conventions
when sharing your ideas.


7. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ Pretend that you live near the shepherd boy
and hear the story of the wolf getting his sheep. What would you tell the
shepherd boy if you had the chance to talk to him? _(Answers may vary but_
_may include that he shouldn’t have lied to the men so much or they may have_
_believed him when it was true.)_

1. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “The startled boy ran toward the valley, and
more loudly than ever he cried, ‘Wolf! Wolf!’”


2. Say the word _startled_ with me.


3. _Startled_ means surprised.


4. I was startled by the bee that landed on my nose.


5. Think of a time when you were startled by someone or something. Try to
use the word _startled_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three students. If
necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses: “My baby sister’s
crying startled me when I was sleeping.”]


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about?


**Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.** I am going to read a
sentence. If I describe a situation in which someone is surprised, say,
“ was startled.” If I describe a situation in which someone is not
surprised, say, “ was not startled.”


 - The sound of the loud siren made the boy jump. _(The boy was startled.)_

“Excuse me,” said one of the tired oxen, “would you please move so that I can

eat my hay?”


The dog, angry at being awakened from his nap, growled and barked at the

ox. ~~_Do you think the dog has a good reason to be angry at the ox? Why or why_~~

~~_not?_~~


“Please,” said the tired, hungry ox, “I’ve had a hard day, and I’m very hungry.”

But the dog, who did not even eat hay, but only enjoyed it for its comfort,

barked and snapped in response, and refused to **budge**, ~~_or move_~~ .


When the farmer came in and saw the dog acting so selfishly, he became

angry and chased the dog out of the manger. The farmer told the dog to stay

out of that manger and that he could never go near that barn again. The oxen

were finally able to eat their dinner after their long day’s work.

question in their responses.


1. **Literal.** Who are the characters in this story? ( _dog, oxen, farmer)_


2. **Literal.** What is the setting of this fable? _(in a barn on a farm_ ) What other fable
have you heard that was set in a barn? _(“The Goose and the Golden Eggs”)_


3. **Evaluative.** Why does the farmer chase the dog out of the manger? _(so the_
_oxen could eat their dinner)_ Is the farmer being reasonable? _(yes)_

_because sharing is important for everyone.)_


[Please continue to model the Question Pair-Share process for students, as
necessary, and scaffold students in their use of the process.]


5. **Evaluative.** _Why? Pair-Share:_ Asking questions after a Read-Aloud is one way
to see how much everyone has learned. In a moment you are going to ask your
neighbor a question about the fable that starts with the word _why_ . For example,
you could ask, “Why was the dog napping in the barn?” Turn to your neighbor
and ask your why question. Listen to your neighbor’s response. Then your
neighbor will ask a new why question, and you will get a chance to respond. I
will call on several of you to share your questions with the class.

3. When someone won’t _budge_, they will not move, not even a little bit.

real life (e.g., pull a plow). List students’ answers in the middle column of the
Personification Chart.


  - Next, ask students to list the things that the animals do in the story that they
would not normally do in real life (e.g., talk). Write down their answers in the

**Application**

 - Gather classroom objects for students to use when questioning a partner
about the use of articles.


**Note to Teacher**


In this lesson, students will learn the saying, “a wolf in sheep’s clothing.”
This is a short, traditional saying that has been passed along orally from
generation to generation. Sayings and phrases such as this usually express
general truths based on experiences and observations of everyday life.
Although some do have literal meanings—that is they mean exactly what
they say—many sayings have a richer meaning beyond the literal level. It is
important to help students understand the difference between the literal
meanings of the words and their implied or figurative meanings.

  - Remind students that they heard the fable “The Dog in the Manger.”


  - Ask students to name some of the characteristics of fables, (e.g., they are
short, fiction stories; they have a moral; and they often use personification).
Have students echo the word _personification_ and remind them that it means
giving animals human qualities.


  - Ask students how they know that “The Dog in the Manger” is a fable. _(It is a_
_short, fictional story; has a moral; and uses personification.)_


  - Tell students that today’s fable also has all these characteristics, making it a
fable like the other stories they have heard thus far.

  - Remind students that the first fable they heard was “The Boy Who Cried
Wolf.”


**Show Image 1A-1: Shepherd boy chuckling**

  - Ask students what animals and other characters appeared in that fable.
_(shepherd boy, sheep, wolf, people of the village)_

responses, acknowledge correct responses by expanding students’ responses,
using richer and more complex language. Ask students to answer in complete
sentences by having them restate the question in their responses.


1. **Inferential.** At the beginning of the fable, why does the wolf disguise
himself? _(to catch a sheep without being noticed)_

   - **Inferential.** Does the wolf’s plan work? Why or why not? _(At first it works_
_because he is able to catch sheep, but later he is killed because of his_
_disguise when the shepherd thinks he is the fattest sheep.)_


**Show Image 5A-1: The wolf covered with a sheepskin**

   - **Evaluative.** Does this illustration show the beginning, middle, or end of the
fable? How do you know? _(the middle, because the wolf is already in disguise)_


2. **Literal.** Fables are written to teach a lesson. What is the lesson, or moral,
of this fable? _(Things are not always as they seem, and, if you pretend to be_
_what you are not, you might end up losing in the end.)_ [Accept reasonable
paraphrasing by students, such as, “Be yourself. Pretending to be someone
that you are not may get you in trouble.”]

costume. Tell students that while a disguise is worn for the specific purpose
of not being recognized, a costume is not necessarily meant to hide one’s
identity. Costumes can be worn for many reasons, from acting in a play
to playing dress up. Costumes are worn for parties and Halloween, as are
disguises, but the main difference is that a disguise is meant to hide the
wearer’s identity.

  - Remind students that in the fable “The Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing,” the wolf,
hiding himself in the skin of a sheep, is able to fool the flock of sheep. Ask
students why the wolf wants to hide in the sheep’s skin. _(to fool the sheep so_
_he can eat them)_

  - Explain to students that “a wolf in sheep’s clothing” is a phrase we use to
describe a hidden enemy, or someone who is not as they appear to be on the
outside. On the outside, the wolf looked like a sheep—but he was not. Explain
that, in the same way, a person can seem very nice but may not actually be

~~**SYNTACTIC AWARENESS ACTIVITY (10 MIN.)**~~


 - The purpose of these syntactic activities is to help students understand the
direct connection between grammatical structures and the meaning of text.
These syntactic activities should be used in conjunction with the complex
text presented in the Read-Alouds.


 - Tell students they are going to learn about _the_ and _a_ . They are tiny, but
important, words.


 - Write these words on the board/chart paper and reference each throughout
the lesson.


**Complex Text Context-Based**

 - Have students listen to the following passages from the Read-Aloud. Tell
students to pay special attention to how _the_ and _a_ are used to describe the
wolf.


   - “Night after night a wolf prowled around a flock of sheep looking for one of
them to eat.”


   - Tell students that the first time they hear about the wolf, the author uses
the word _a_ to tell us that it can look like any wolf. The author says “a wolf”
so we can think of a wolf in our heads when listening to the Read-Aloud. It
doesn’t matter if it is a specific wolf; it just needs to be any wolf.


**Show Image 5A-1: The wolf covered with a sheepskin**

   - “But one day the wolf found the skin of a sheep that had been thrown
aside.”


   - Tell students that now the author switches to using _the_ to talk about the
wolf. The author says “the wolf” so that we think of this specific wolf, and
only this specific wolf, in our heads when listening to the Read-Aloud.


**Explicit Instruction**
**Show Image 5B-1: Soccer balls**

 - Point to the left-hand side of the image. Explain to students that in this
part of the image, there are many soccer balls. Tell them that when you ask
someone to give you _a_ soccer ball, it does not matter which soccer ball they
give you—any soccer ball is fine.


 - Point to the right-hand side of the image. Explain to students that in this
part of the image, there is only one soccer ball. Tell them that when you ask
someone to give you _the_ soccer ball, you mean that specific soccer ball.


 - Ask students which word lets them know that you were talking about any one
of the soccer balls. _(a)_


Unit 1 Sharing Stories


 - Ask students which word lets them know that you were talking about a
specific soccer ball. _(the)_


**Real World**

 - Explain to students that these tiny words are helpful when asking
questions, too.


 - Create a real-world situation by placing three or four pencils on a student’s
desk. Go up to that student and ask for a pencil. For example, you may ask if
you may please have a pencil.


 - Ask students if, when you asked this question, you were asking for a
particular pencil, or would any pencil have been okay. _(any pencil)_


 - Create another real-world situation by giving a few students pencils to hold.
Go up to one of those students and ask for the pencil in their hand. For
example, you may ask if you could please have the pencil.


 - Ask students if, when you asked this question using _the_, you were asking for a
particular pencil, or will any pencil be okay. _(a particular pencil)_


 - Have students work with a neighbor to ask and answer questions about
things using _a_ and _the_ . You may wish to provide students with classroom
objects to prompt questioning, such as pencils, crayons, erasers, etc.

Tell students to circle the word on Activity Page 5.1 that correctly
completes the phrase they learned about “ wolf in sheep’s
clothing.” _(a)_

One hot summer day, a fox was strolling along

when he noticed a **bunch** of **juicy** grapes just

turning **ripe**, ~~_or a group of grapes full of juice,_~~

~~_ready to be eaten_~~ ~~,~~ hanging on a vine high

above. “Mmm, that’s just the thing to take





care of my thirst,” said the fox. He trotted back

a few steps, then ran forward and jumped,

_Missing_ also means to not
be in a usual, or expected,
place.

just missing, ~~_or not getting_~~ ~~,~~ the grapes. He turned around and tried again.

“One, two, three, go,” he said, and he **lunged** at the grapes with all his might.

But again, he missed. ~~_Fox is trying really hard to get the grapes, isn’t he? He_~~

~~_lunged, or moved forward suddenly._~~


Again and again he tried to **pluck**, ~~_or pull off_~~ ~~,~~ the grapes from the vine, but at

last he gave up. He walked away with his nose in the air, saying, “I didn’t want

those old grapes anyway. I’m sure they are sour.” ~~_Why would the fox walk_~~

~~_away after trying so hard to get the juicy grapes?_~~


_Moral: You shouldn’t speak badly about something that you once wanted, just_

_because you can’t have it._ ~~_[Have students echo the moral and then discuss_~~

answers and/or fail to use Read-Aloud or unit vocabulary in their responses,
acknowledge correct responses by expanding students’ responses, using
richer and more complex language. Ask students to answer in complete
sentences by having them restate the question in their responses.


1. **Literal.** Who is the character in this fable? ( _fox_ )


**Show Image 6A-1: Fox and the grapes**


2. **Evaluative.** Does this illustration show the beginning, the middle, or the
end of the fable? How do you know? _(Answers may vary, but it is not the end_
_because in the end, the fox turns his nose in the air and walks away.)_


3. **Evaluative.** The plot, or sequence of events, in this fable describes the
many times the fox tries to get the grapes. In the end he does not get them.
Can you think of a way that the fox might have been able to get the grapes?
_(Answers may vary.)_

**Use an I Spy activity for follow-up.** Look around the room for bunches of
things. [You may need to purposely place some bunches of objects around
the room.] I will ask one student to give a clue by describing what they see,
for example, “I spy a bunch of objects used for drawing.” The others will guess
what the student is talking about by replying, for example, “You spy a bunch of
crayons!” Be sure to use the word _bunch_ in your descriptions and answers.

~~**SAYINGS AND PHRASES (5 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.10.D**~~


**Sour Grapes**

  - Ask students if they have ever heard the phrase “sour grapes.” Ask them what
kind of picture comes to mind when they hear this phrase.


  - Have students repeat the phrase “sour grapes.”


  - Tell students the phrase “sour grapes” is something someone says about the
negative comments someone else makes when they could not get something
they really wanted.


  - Tell students that in “The Fox and the Grapes,” the fox says something negative
about the grapes that he wanted so badly. What did the fox say about the grapes
at the end? _(“I didn’t want those old grapes anyway. I’m sure they are sour.”)_
When the fox cannot reach the grapes, he decides it is okay he cannot have them
because they probably wouldn’t taste good anyway. So, when we talk about the
fox’s reaction to not getting what he wanted, we say it is “sour grapes.”


  - Tell students that just like the fox in this story, when someone says
something negative about something they wanted but cannot have, we call
their comments “sour grapes.”


  - Give students an example of this (e.g., Your teacher wants a certain pencil.
When he learns he cannot have it, he says it doesn’t write well anyway.) Your
teacher’s comments are sour grapes.

#### Pausing Point


~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


You should pause here for one day to review, reinforce, and/or extend the
material taught thus far.


It is highly recommended that you use the Mid-Unit Content Assessment
to assess students’ knowledge of fables. You may also choose to do any
combination of the following activities in any order, or create other activities
that will help review, reinforce, and/or extend the material taught thus far.


~~**MID-UNIT CONTENT ASSESSMENT**~~


**Part I**


Materials: Activity Page PP.1

  - Have students identify the six fables illustrated on the two pages of Activity
Page PP.1. As you read a sentence about each of the fables you have heard,
have students put the corresponding number beside the picture that shows
the fable being described.


1. In this fable, a shepherd boy gets bored tending the sheep and decides to
“cry wolf” when there really isn’t a wolf.


2. The moral of this fable is “Don’t count your chickens before they’re hatched;
or don’t count on having everything turn out exactly as you plan, because you
may be disappointed.”


3. In this fable, a farmer learns a lesson about not being greedy.


4. In this fable, an animal character is stingy and refuses to budge so others
can eat.


5. In this fable, an animal character gets sold at the market because of his
disguise.


6. The phrase “sour grapes” comes from this fable.

**Reading:** Students will review the morals of a folktale.


~~**TEKS 1.1.A**~~


~~**WHAT HAVE WE ALREADY LEARNED? (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that the stories they have been hearing are called fables.


  - Remind students that a fable is a fictional story that teaches an important
lesson or moral.


  - Remind students they heard a fable called “The Fox and the Grapes.” Ask
students to recall the moral, or lesson, that they heard in “The Fox and
the Grapes.” _(You shouldn’t speak badly about something that you once_
_wanted, just because you can’t have it.)_


~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION OR TERMS (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that today they are going to hear a well-known story, “The Tale
of Peter Rabbit.” Tell students that the author and illustrator of the story is
a woman named Beatrix Potter. Ask students if they have heard of Beatrix
Potter or “The Tale of Peter Rabbit.”


  - Tell students that “The Tale of Peter Rabbit” is a type of fictional story called a
_folktale_ .


  - Explain to students that a _folktale_ is a story that someone made up a
long time ago and has been told again and again. It was first told to family
members or friends and later written down for many people to enjoy. Have
students say the word _folktale_ .


  - Tell students a folktale is fiction because it is made up from one’s imagination
and is not real.


**Show Image 7A-1: The Rabbit family/Mrs. Rabbit with her bunnies**

  - Ask students what they see in the illustration. Point to Peter Rabbit, and
explain that he is the main character in the story.


  - Ask students to share what they know about rabbits and the kinds of things
they do.


**TEKS 1.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and answer questions using multi-word responses.


Unit 1 Sharing Stories


- Explain to students that rabbits are small animals that are herbivores—they
only eat plants. Rabbits sometimes build a nest on the ground hidden under
a thicket or bush.


- Tell students the story they will hear is make-believe, but sometimes Peter
Rabbit does things that a regular rabbit might do.

folktale is.


~~**“THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image 7A-1: The Rabbit family/Mrs.**
**Rabbit with her bunnies**

Once upon a time there were four little

Rabbits, and their names were Flopsy, Mopsy,

Cotton-tail, and Peter.





They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank,

underneath the root of a very big fir-tree. ~~_Who_~~

~~_are the members of the Rabbit family?_~~



“Now, my dears,” said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, “you may go into the

fields or down the lane, but don’t go into Mr. McGregor’s garden: your Father

had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.

**Show Image 7A-3: Bunnies picking berries/**

Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail, who were good

blackberries. ~~_Who is good and listens to their_~~

But Peter, who was very **naughty**, ran straight

away to Mr. McGregor’s garden, and squeezed

under the gate! ~~_Who is naughty, or makes a bad choice, and does not listen to_~~

Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages,

but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, “Stop,

Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed

all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way

back to the gate.





He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages,

and the other shoe amongst the potatoes. ~~_What_~~



~~_happens to Peter because he is so frightened or scared? (He rushes and loses_~~

~~_his shoes.)_~~


After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might

have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry

net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. It was a blue jacket

with brass buttons, quite new. ~~_Will Peter be able to get out of the net?_~~


**Show Image 7A-7: Sparrows imploring Peter/**
**Peter escaping the sieve**

Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears;

but his **sobs** were overheard by some friendly

sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement,

and implored him to **exert** himself. ~~_Sobs are the_~~





~~_sounds sometimes made when crying. Who hears_~~

~~_Peter’s sobs and encourages him to exert himself,_~~



~~_or make a real effort, to wriggle out of the net?_~~


Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, ~~_[Point to the sieve as you read, and_~~

~~_explain that it is a kitchen strainer that has a wire basket on top.]_~~ which he

intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time,

leaving his jacket behind him. ~~_Is he able to escape? What does Peter leave_~~

~~_behind? (his jacket)_~~


Lesson 7 The Tale of Peter Rabbit
**85**


**Show Image 7A-8: Peter jumping into the**
**watering can/Mr. McGregor searching the shed**

And rushed into the tool-shed, and jumped into

a can. It would have been a beautiful thing to

hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.


Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was

somewhere in the tool-shed, perhaps hidden



underneath a flower-pot. He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.


Presently Peter sneezed—“Kertyschoo!” Mr. McGregor was after him in no

time. ~~_Where does Peter hide from Mr. McGregor?_~~ ~~(in a can in the tool-shed)~~

~~_This works until Peter does what?_~~


**Show Image 7A-9: Peter jumping out the**
**window/Peter resting**

And tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped

out of a window, upsetting three plants. The

window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he

was tired of running after Peter. He went back to





his work. ~~_That was a close call. Has Peter gotten_~~

~~_away from Mr. McGregor?_~~



Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had

not the least idea which way to go. Also he was very damp with sitting in that can.


After a time he began to wander about, going _lippity_ - _lippity_ —not very fast,

and looking all round. ~~_What will Peter do next?_~~


**Show Image 7A-10: Peter and the old mouse/**
**Peter and the cat**

He found a door in a wall; but it was locked,

and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to

squeeze underneath.





An old mouse was running in and out over the

stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to



**86**



her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such

a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. She only shook her head

at him. Peter began to cry. ~~_Why do you think Peter is crying if he has gotten_~~

~~_away from Mr. McGregor? (Answers may vary, but may include that he wasn’t_~~

~~_sure how to get out of the garden.)_~~


Unit 1 Sharing Stories


Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more

and more puzzled. Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled

his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some gold-fish. She sat very, very

still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter

thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he had heard about cats

from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny. ~~_Why doesn’t Peter ask the cat for_~~

~~_help? (The cat might try to harm Peter.)_~~


**Show Image 7A-11: Peter and Mr. McGregor/**
**Peter escaping the garden**

He went back towards the tool-shed, but

suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise

of a hoe— _scr-r-ritch_, _scratch_, _scratch_, _scritch_ .

Peter scuttered underneath the bushes. But





presently, as nothing happened, he came out,

and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped



over. The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was

turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate! ~~_[Point to the gate.] Will_~~

~~_Peter be able to get out of the gate without Mr. McGregor seeing him?_~~


Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as fast

as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes.


Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care. He

slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the

garden. ~~_Let’s give a cheer because Peter is outside of the garden and safe._~~


**Show Image 7A-12: Scarecrow/Peter safe**
**at home**

Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and

the shoes for a scarecrow to frighten the

blackbirds. ~~_Whose jacket and shoes are those?_~~





Peter never stopped running or looked behind

him till he got home to the big fir-tree.



He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor

of the rabbithole and shut his eyes. His mother was busy cooking; she

wondered what he had done with his clothes. It was the second little jacket

and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight! ~~_Why is Peter so tired? If_~~

~~_this is the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter has lost, do you_~~

~~_think Peter has gotten into mischief before?_~~

~~**RETELL “THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT” (20 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 1.3.D**~~


  - Tell students that as a class you are going to retell in writing the tale you just
read about Peter Rabbit.


  - Referencing The Writing Process chart, tell students you will first use a
Somebody Wanted But So Then chart to recall what happened in the story
and plan their writing.


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 7.1. Refer to the Somebody Wanted But
So Then chart you prepared in advance.


  - Lead students in identifying each of the following parts to complete the
chart. When filling in the “Somebody” row of the chart, remind students
that the “somebody” is a person in the story, or a character. In addition,
remind students that the “So” and “Then” labels are temporal words that are
indications of the plot, or sequence of events, of the story.

|Somebody|Peter Rabbit|
|---|---|
|**Wanted**|to eat the fruits and vegetables in Mr. McGregor’s garden.|
|**But**|Mr. McGregor did not want him eating food from his garden.|
|**So**|Peter ran away and Mr. McGregor chased him until Peter got lost.|
|**Then**|Peter fnally found the way out and made it home, but he was sick<br>from his adventure so he only got tea for dinner.|



  - Once the chart has been completed, guide the class in translating these ideas into
sentences that tell a story with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Write these
sentences on the board/chart paper. Reinforce that this is the draft, as indicated in
The Writing Process chart. After the story has been written, read it aloud to the class.

**Show Image 8A-2: Hen with brood of**
**baby chicks**

Once there was a hen who had a large

**brood**, ~~_or family_~~, of little chicks. They were all

fine, plump little birds, except the youngest.

He was quite unlike his brothers and sisters.





He looked as if he had been cut right in half.

All of his brothers and sisters had two wings



and two legs and two eyes, but he had only one wing, one leg, and one eye.

And he had only half a head and half a beak. His mother shook her head

sadly as she looked at him. “Poor thing!” she said. “He is only a half-chick.”


The mother hen called her youngest chick Medio Pollito

[/m// e//d/*/ ee/*/ ə /] [/p//oe/*/y//ae/*/t//oe/], which is Spanish for “half
chick.” ~~_So why is he called, “Medio Pollito” or “Little Half-Chick”?_~~ She thought

that he would never be able to take care of himself. She decided that she

would have to keep him at home and look after him.


But Medio Pollito had a different idea. Medio Pollito turned out to be a very

**stubborn** ~~_Stubborn means that he would not change how he did things._~~ and

As it is used here, the word
_brood_ means a family.
_Brood_ can also mean to
think or worry a lot about
something. Point out the
brood of chicks in the
illustration to reinforce the
meaning of this word in
the context of the story.

independent little chick. Even though his brothers and sisters did just what

they were told to do, Medio Pollito did not. When his mother called for him

to come back to the chicken house, he hid in the cornfield. Sometimes he

pretended that he could not hear her (because, of course, he had only one

ear). The older he became, the more willful he became. He would not listen

to his mother and he was often rude to his brothers and sisters, even though

they were always extra nice to him. ~~_So, is he a very kind, or nice, chick?_~~


**Show Image 8A-3: Medio Pollito leaves for**
**Madrid**

One day Medio Pollito strutted up to his

mother and made an announcement: “I am

tired of life in this dull barnyard. I am going

to Madrid to dine, ~~_or have dinner_~~, with the





king.” ~~_Madrid is a city in Spain. Do you think_~~

~~_this is a good idea?_~~

Here, the _rest of you_ refers
to the others. _Rest_ can
also mean to stop doing
work or an activity.

Here, _stream_ refers to
a small body of water.
_Stream_ can also mean
a continuous flow of
something (e.g., a stream
of ants marching across
the lawn). Point out the
stream in the illustration
to reinforce the meaning
of this word in the context
of the story.

“Madrid!” exclaimed his mother. “Why, that is a long journey, even for a

grown-up. You aren’t old enough to go to Madrid yet. Wait a bit. When you are

a little older, we will go to the city together.”


But Medio Pollito had made up his mind. He would not listen to his mother, or

to his brothers and sisters, all of whom pleaded with him to stay. “I am going

to Madrid to dine with the king,” he declared. “And when I get there I will

make my fortune and live in a big house. Perhaps I will even invite the rest of

you to pay me a short visit sometime.”


With that, he turned and hopped off on his one leg.


His mother ran after him and called out, “Be sure to be kind to everyone you

meet!” But Medio Pollito did not listen. He was in a hurry and, as usual, was

thinking only of himself.


**Show Image 8A-4: Medio Pollito at the stream**

Medio Pollito hopped on until he came to a

little **stream** of water that was almost choked

with weeds. ~~_A stream is a small body of running_~~

~~_water. When a stream is full of weeds, it is_~~

~~_very hard for the water to move._~~ “Oh, Medio





Pollito,” the stream called out, “please help me

by pulling some of these weeds so I can flow



freely!” ~~_Do you think Medio Pollito will help the stream? Why or why not?_~~


Unit 1 Sharing Stories


“Help you?” exclaimed Medio Pollito, tossing his head and shaking the few

feathers in his tail. “Do you think I have time to **waste** to do that sort of

thing? ~~_Waste means to use up something carelessly and foolishly. Medio_~~

~~_Pollito does not want to waste, or use up, his time helping the stream._~~ Help

yourself, and don’t bother busy travelers like me. I am off to Madrid to dine

with the king.” And away he hopped. ~~_So does Medio Pollito help the stream?_~~

~~(no)~~ ~~_Why not?_~~


**Show Image 8A-5: Medio Pollito at the fire**

A little later, Medio Pollito came to an

**abandoned** fire that some campers left burning

in the woods. ~~_Abandoned means left behind._~~

“Oh, Medio Pollito,” the fire said, “please toss

some sticks on me so I won’t burn out!” ~~_Who_~~





~~_does Medio Pollito meet after the water? What_~~

~~_does the fire ask Medio Pollito to do?_~~



“Poo!” said Medio Pollito. “Do you think I have time to waste to do that sort of

thing? I am off to Madrid to dine with the king.” And away he hopped. ~~_Does he help_~~

~~_the fire? Why not? [Encourage students to use the word_~~ ~~waste~~ ~~_in their answers.]_~~


**Show Image 8A-6: Medio Pollito at the**
**tree blowing in the wind**

The next morning, as he was nearing Madrid,

Medio Pollito came upon a large chestnut

tree in which the wind had gotten tangled

up. “Oh, Medio Pollito,” said the wind, “won’t





you climb up here and help me get myself

untangled?” ~~_Who does he meet after the_~~



~~_water and the fire? (wind) Do you think he will help the wind? Why or why not?_~~


“It’s your own fault for going so high up there,” said Medio Pollito. “And

besides, I don’t have time to waste to do that sort of thing. I am off to Madrid

to dine with the king.” And away he hopped.


When he entered the city, Medio Pollito saw the beautiful royal palace. He

was so excited to meet the king, he hopped right into the courtyard without

hesitation. The king’s cook spotted him and yelled, “You will make a nice

addition to the king’s dinner.” ~~_Is the cook inviting him to dine, or have dinner,_~~

~~_with the king?_~~ The cook scooped up Medio Pollito in his hand. He took him

back to the kitchen, and tossed him into a pot of water! ~~_What do you think the_~~

~~_cook is making?_~~ Then he set the pot on the stove.


**Show Image 8A-7: Medio Pollito in the**
**kitchen**

Medio Pollito was getting very wet. “Oh, water!”

he cried, “Don’t soak me like this!” But the

water replied, “You would not help me when

I was a little stream choking with weeds, so





why should I help you now?” ~~_Who does Medio_~~

~~_Pollito ask for help? Does the water help? Why_~~



~~_not? [Remind students that he met the water at the stream previously.]_~~


Then the fire on the stove began to heat the water. Medio Pollito felt very

hot. “Oh, fire!” he cried, “don’t cook me like this!” But the fire replied, “You

would not help me when I was about to burn out, so why should I help you

now?” ~~_Who does Medio Pollito ask for help next? Does the fire help? Why not?_~~

~~_[Remind students that he met the fire in the woods previously.]_~~


The fire got hotter and hotter. The heat was so unbearable that Medio Pollito

grew more and more desperate ~~_Desperate means to lose hope._~~ to escape.

Just then, the cook raised the lid of the pot to see if the soup was ready.


“What’s this?” said the cook. “I have overcooked the chicken. He is all

blackened and burnt to a crisp. I can’t serve this to the king!”


**Show Image 8A-8: The cook tossing Medio**
**Pollito out the window**

The cook grabbed Medio Pollito and threw

him out the kitchen window. With a gust,

the wind caught him and carried him away

so fast he could hardly breathe. ~~_Does Medio_~~





~~_Pollito have dinner with the king?_~~


“Oh, wind,” Medio Pollito cried, “don’t

push me around like this. Please, set me down!” But the wind replied, “You

would not help me when I was caught in the tree, so why should I help

you now?” ~~_Who does Medio Pollito ask for help? Does the wind help? Why_~~

~~_not?_~~ And with that the wind lifted Medio Pollito up in the air to the top of

a building and left him stuck atop the cupola. ~~_A cupola is a small domed_~~

And that is where you can find Medio Pollito,

to this very day. If you go to Madrid and look

for the tallest church in town, you will see

a black weather vane in the shape of half a

chicken, turning in the wind. That is Medio

Pollito, the chick who would not help others.

**Show Image 8A-2: Hen with brood of baby chicks**

  - Remind students that they have read both fables and folktales in this unit.
Briefly ask the following questions:


    - What is a folktale? _(a story that someone made up a long time ago and has_
_been told again and again)_


    - Remind students that in the last lesson, they heard the folktale “The Little
Half-Chick (Medio Pollito).”


    - Ask students to recall the moral that they heard in the folktale. _(Medio_
_Pollito should have been kind and helped the water, fire, and wind; “Do unto_
_others as you would have done unto you.”)_


    - What is a fable? _(a short story intended to teach a lesson, called “the moral_
_of the story”)_


    - Ask students to recall “The Boy Who Cried Wolf.” What was the moral of
that story? _(It is important to always tell the truth.)_


~~**ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION OR TERMS (5 MIN.)**~~


**• Background for Teacher:** The text for today’s lesson, a story on the Parable
of the Prodigal Son, is derived from the Book of Luke, a book of the New
Testament of the Christian Bible. The parable recounts the story of a rebellious
son and his forgiving father. The term “prodigal son” has become ubiquitous
in popular culture as a way to describe a wayward child. The inclusion of the
parable in this unit helps build background knowledge useful for students in
future studies of literature and history.


  - Tell students that parables are simple, short fiction stories used to teach a
moral or spiritual lesson.

- Parables are similar to fables that also teach a lesson, but parables usually
have human characters, while fables have characters that represent natural
elements, such as animals or plants.


- Explain to students that even though parables are simple, they are not always
easy to understand. Parables often use symbols to teach a lesson. A symbol is an
object or image that represents an idea. Draw a picture of a heart on chart paper
or the board and ask students “What does this heart mean?” _(love)_ Reinforce with
students that the picture of the heart means love. That means it is a symbol that
represents love.


- Remind students that, so far, they have read several fables written by Aesop a
long time ago. They’ve also read two folktales that were also written long ago
but are a bit more modern. Now they will read a very old parable.


- Parables can be found in a variety of books. The Bible is an example of a book
that features many parables.


- Remind students that the Bible is a collection of ancient texts that are
organized as books and grouped into different parts, and its different parts are
the core books of the Jewish and Christian religions.

**A Remembered Story**

The Parable of the **Prodigal** Son is a popular story in the Christian Bible.

~~_Prodigal describes spending money in a wasteful way._~~ Parables are short

stories told by different people featured in the Bible as a way to teach

lessons on spiritual matters. ~~_The word parable means a short story used to_~~

~~_teach moral or spiritual lessons._~~ In the Bible, Jesus told parables to help his

**followers** understand his teachings. These parables were important not

only to his followers but also to authors and artists who have used them as

inspiration to write new stories that teach lessons. ~~_Followers are people who_~~

~~_believe in and follow something or someone._~~


**Show Image 9A-1: The Story of Two Sons**

Here’s how the parable goes: One day a

father was talking to his two sons. The

younger son asked his father for his

**inheritance**, even though it was not yet





time for him to receive it. ~~_An inheritance is_~~

~~_a gift of money or property a parent might_~~

~~_leave to a child when the parent passes_~~



~~_away. Parents often want to save money to make sure that this money can help_~~

~~_their children. But it is not usual or acceptable to ask for an inheritance before_~~

~~_someone has passed away._~~


**TEKS 1.6.G** Evaluate details to determine what is most important with adult assistance; **TEKS 1.8.A** Discuss topics and

Lesson 9 The Prodigal Son
**113**


“The younger son said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’

So, [the father] divided his property between them.” [1] ~~_Why do you think the_~~

~~_son wanted his inheritance now? What do you predict the son will do with the_~~











land so that he could
spend freely, away from his
father’s watchful eye.”).

and traveled to a distant land so that he could



spend freely, away from his father’s watchful eye. ~~_How do you think his father_~~

~~_felt when his youngest son moved far away? [Pause for students’ responses.]_~~

~~_(Answers may vary but should include the idea that the father was sad and_~~

~~_would miss his son.)_~~ When the younger son arrived in the new land, he quickly

began spending his inheritance. He did not spend it wisely. ~~_Do you remember_~~

~~_what it means to be wise, like when you learned about the wisdom of Solomon_~~

~~_in kindergarten?_~~ In a short amount of time, the inheritance was gone.


The younger brother had chosen to spend all his money on things he didn’t

need. These might have been things like more fancy silk robes than he could

ever wear, luxurious rugs for extra rooms in his enormous home, and dozens of

baskets of food of which he only ate a little, leaving the rest to rot. These also

might have been things that were not good for him, like too many dried fruits

and honey that he ate all at once. ~~_Dried fruits and honey have a lot of sugar, like_~~

~~_candy._~~ He saved nothing for the future at all. ~~_Were your predictions correct?_~~

~~_[Pause for students’ responses.] What could the son have spent his money on_~~

~~_to make sure his inheritance lasted a long time? (He could have bought just_~~

~~_what he needed)._~~





Unit 1 Sharing Stories



1 Luke 15:1


~~_Therefore, they become expensive. During a famine, something like a gallon of milk_~~

~~_might cost as much money as a whole meal for the entire family._~~


Because he had wasted all his inheritance on things he didn’t need, the younger

brother was left with no money for necessary things. He started to realize what

a terrible mistake he had made in spending his inheritance wastefully. Without

money, food, or shelter, the younger brother became hungry and in desperate

need of food and a place to live. There was so little food available, even for those

who had money, so the son had to search for a way to feed himself and survive.


“So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his

fields to feed pigs.” [2] ~~_Hired himself out means to be hired to do a job. A citizen would_~~

~~_be a townsperson or resident._~~ The more the son worked, the hungrier he became.

“He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one

gave him anything.” [3] ~~_This means that the son was so hungry he wanted to eat the_~~

~~_pigs’ food. What do you predict the son will do? [Pause for students’ responses.]_~~

~~_Let’s continue reading to see if your predictions are correct._~~


**Show Image 9A-4: What’s lost is now found**

Finally, in desperation, the younger son

decided to return home. The younger son

didn’t know if his father would welcome him

after he had spent all of his money wastefully.

He didn’t know how his father would feel





about the mistake he had made in not saving

any of his inheritance for the future. However,



the younger son had no other choice, if he were to survive. He had nothing

left, so he humbly returned to his family. ~~_Humbly means he no longer felt_~~

~~_selfish or proud. He was willing to admit that he had made mistakes._~~


When he returned, his father was so overcome with emotion and happiness

at seeing his son again that he warmly embraced, or hugged, him. “. . . his

father saw him and was filled with **compassion** for him; he ran to his son,

threw his arms around him and kissed him.” [4] ~~_Compassion means a feeling_~~

~~_of concern or care for someone who is having a hard time and desiring to_~~

~~_help that person._~~ The father could have reacted differently to his son. He

could have been upset or mad that his son did not spend his money wisely.

Instead, the father welcomed his son with love and open arms. ~~_Have you ever_~~

~~_shown love or compassion to someone who did something wrong? [Pause for_~~

~~_students’ responses and discuss.]_~~

3 Luke 15:16
4 Luke 15:20


Lesson 9 The Prodigal Son
**115**


The son explained to his father that he knew he had not acted wisely when

spending all of his money wastefully and that he had learned from his

mistakes. He pleaded with his father to forgive him and to hire him as a

servant. He told his father he would work for him as his servants did. ~~_What_~~

~~_did the son do to solve his problem? Were your predictions correct? [Pause_~~

~~_for students’ responses.] How do you think the father felt when his son asked_~~

~~_for forgiveness? [Pause for students’ responses.]_~~


The father was so delighted that his son had returned that he forgave him

immediately and welcomed him with open arms. Even more importantly, the

father was pleased that his son had learned an important lesson from his

mistakes and knew that the son was not likely to repeat such mistakes in the

future. He gave his son a new robe, a ring, and sandals. He exclaimed to

everyone that they should have a feast to celebrate the return of his younger

son! ~~_The father did not make his son a servant because he was delighted_~~

~~_about his return. He wanted to celebrate that he was home._~~


**Show Image 9A-5: Welcomed home**


**The Older Son**

“Meanwhile, the older son was in the field.

When he came near the house, he heard music

and dancing.” [5] According to the parable, the

older brother was a hard worker. When the





younger brother went far away, the older

brother stayed behind and worked for his



**116**



father. He never disobeyed his father and was a good son. When the older son

heard the music and dancing, he asked a servant, “What is going on?” The

servant told him that his younger brother had returned home. The older son

became angry and upset. He felt it was unfair that his younger brother would

be celebrated after what he had done. ~~_How would you feel if you were the older_~~

~~_brother? [Pause for students’ responses.]_~~


The older brother went to his father. He said, “Why are you celebrating?

Didn’t he waste all of your money? Was it not me that stayed here and

obeyed you the whole time?”


The father told his older son not to be upset. “‘My son,’ the father said,

‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.’” He said that they

must be happy that the younger son had returned and told him that now


5 Luke 15:25


Unit 1 Sharing Stories


was a time to celebrate. He explained that the younger son had learned a

great lesson from the mistakes he had made in wasting his inheritance. The

father described to his older son how his brother now understood that his

actions were wrong and had come home to ask for forgiveness. Both sons

learned that their father’s forgiveness came from his immense, or great, love,

meaning that their father would always love them.













~~_that the son learned from his mistakes, etc.)_~~

In the Christian Bible, the Parable of the Prodigal Son is used to make a point

about the importance of forgiving and welcoming others even if they have made

mistakes, because everyone makes mistakes. It also teaches about learning

from mistakes to make better choices in the future.


This parable teaches that the world is a much better place when we can

love and forgive each other, such as when a parent or guardian gives a child

**unconditional love** . ~~_Unconditional love is when someone loves, no matter_~~

~~_what. Although the younger son made a terrible mistake, his father forgave him_~~

~~_and loved him unconditionally, or without limits. Why is it important to forgive_~~

~~_one another? [Pause for students’ responses.]_~~

~~**NOTE TO TEACHER**~~


Please use these final two days to address class results of the Unit Assessment.
We suggest you begin with the whole-class Read-Aloud activity to reinforce unit
content. Based on the results of the Unit Assessment and students’ formative
assessments, you may wish to use the remaining time to provide remediation
opportunities that target specific areas of weakness for individual students,
small groups, or the whole class.


Alternatively, you may also choose to use this class time to extend or enrich
students’ experience with unit knowledge. A number of enrichment activities
are provided below in order to give students opportunities to enliven their
experiences with unit concepts.


~~**READ-ALOUD**~~


  - Tell students that today they will hear a fable by Aesop. Ask students to name
another fable they have heard that was written by Aesop. _(Answers could_
_include “The Boy Who Cried Wolf,” “The Maid and the Milk Pail,” “The Fox and_
_the Grapes,” “The Goose and the Golden Eggs,” “The Dog in the Manger,” or_
_others.)_


  - Ask students to name some characteristics of fables. _(Answers may vary_
_but could include that fables are fiction stories intended to teach a lesson_
_or moral. They often include animal characters. They have titles, characters,_
_settings, and a plot.)_


  - Tell students to listen actively by asking and answering questions using
detailed responses to learn the moral, or lesson, of the story.


Unit 1 Sharing Stories


**The Hare and the Tortoise**
**By Aesop**
The Hare was once boasting of his speed before the other animals ~~.~~ ~~_A hare is a_~~
~~_kind of animal that is like a large rabbit. Boasting means bragging._~~ “I have never
yet been beaten,” said he, “when I put forth my full speed. I challenge any one
here to race with me.”


The Tortoise said quietly, “I accept your challenge.”


“That is a good joke,” said the Hare. “I could dance round you all the way.”

~~_Why does the Hare think the Tortoise is joking? How quickly do tortoises_~~

~~_move?_~~


“Keep your boasting till you’ve beaten me,” answered the Tortoise. “Shall we

race?”


So a course was fixed and a start was made. The Hare darted almost out of

sight at once but soon stopped and, to show his contempt for the Tortoise,

lay down to have a nap. ~~_Darting is a quick movement similar to running._~~

~~_Contempt means dislike or disgust. How does the Hare feel about racing the_~~

~~_Tortoise?_~~ The Tortoise plodded on and plodded on, and when the Hare awoke

from his nap, he saw the Tortoise just near the winning-post and could not

run up in time to save the race. Then said the Tortoise:


“Plodding wins the race.” ~~_Plodding means moving very slowly._~~


1. Who won the race? _(the Tortoise)_


2. Name an example of personification from this fable. _(the speaking_

_animals)_


3. All of Aesop’s fables, or stories, were meant to teach a moral, or a lesson,

about how to behave. What is the moral of this fable? _(Plodding wins the_

_race; being slow and steady can be good.)_


4. Is this an important lesson for you to remember? Why or why not?

_(Answers will vary, but students should offer a reason for their response.)_


You may also use The Somebody Wanted But So Then chart (Activity

Page PP.2) for a retelling of the fable.

~~**REMEDIATION**~~


Remediation opportunities include:


 - targeting Review Activities


 - revisiting lesson Applications


 - rereading and discussing selected Read-Alouds


~~**ENRICHMENT**~~


**Student Choice**

 - Have students select a Read-Aloud to be heard again.


**Story Map**


**Note:** Some students may need to work with the teacher and complete this
on chart paper as a group, whereas others may be able to complete the story
map on their own.


 - Have students use Activity Page UR.1 to identify and describe the characters,
setting, and plot of their favorite story.


**Somebody Wanted But So Then**

 - The Somebody Wanted But So Then chart may be used for a retelling of any
of the fables.


**Retelling a Story with Puppets**


Materials: Paper bags, drawing tools, miscellaneous materials for
decorating

 - Have students make simple puppets of the characters from a particular
folktale and then use them to retell the story.


**Write About It: Retelling a Fable or Folktale**

 - As a class, brainstorm the sequence of events: beginning, middle, and end
of one of the fables or folktales heard. Also discuss the other elements of
fictional stories, including characters, setting, and the moral/lesson.


 - Have students draw a picture on each page of the booklet to show the
beginning, important middle events, and end of the story. Students may also
write or dictate a sentence to go with each picture.


 - Have students share their stories with a partner or with the class.

**On Stage**

 - Reread and have students act out any of the fables or folktales.


 - Encourage students to portray actions and feelings and to use some of their
own dialogue.


 - Alternatively, ask students to create a skit to demonstrate one of the sayings
and phrases they learned, such as “do unto others as you would have done
unto you.”
