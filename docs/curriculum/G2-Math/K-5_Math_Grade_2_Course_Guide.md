**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 2


**Introduction**

Welcome to the Grade 2 Course Guide. This guide is designed to give Grade 2 teachers specific knowledge
about the structure of the instructional materials to help them effectively transition into the program.
Included in this guide is information about standards, assessment tools, the focus of each module, and ways
for families to support students at home. This guide also provides information about how to tailor the culture
of learning to the developmental needs of students, including a background on developmental advances
that affect how students learn in Grade 2 and practical strategies for troubleshooting misconceptions
collaboratively with students.


**Profile of a Grade 2 Math Learner**

Grades 2 through 4 cover a period when students’ math abilities are rapidly changing, growing, and starting to
come together. Their motor skills, estimation abilities, abstract reasoning, self-regulation, and peer interaction
skills need to be coordinated for them to be successful with the instructional materials. Often, this means that
students may become confused or solve problems incorrectly because one or more of the requisite skills are
still developing. For example, students with developing motor skills may have difficulty with manipulating tiles
during activities that teach arrays.

Students at these grade levels are also at the very beginning of developing their abstract reasoning abilities.
For this reason, students can find it challenging to reason about inequalities with different units (e.g., that
10 cm is smaller than 5 m, despite 10 being a larger whole number than 5) or inequalities with different place
values (e.g., that 900 is less than 1,100, even though 9 is greater than 1). Students’ concrete and rule-based
reasoning can also make it more challenging for them to grasp key principles in arithmetic (e.g., that 3 × 6 is
the same as 6 × 3).

In grades 2 through 4, many students are still developing into fluent readers, which might cause them to focus
on certain terms in a word problem and ignore the rest of the context (e.g., they look for the word _total_ and
then add the numbers in the problem). In addition, students’ self-control is still developing. This might cause
students to rush to solve problems and write down the first answer they think of.

These emerging skills need to be coordinated to solve math problems correctly. As a result, teachers of
students in this age range play an important role in helping young math learners learn the math content
and in laying a foundation for number sense, arithmetic, problem solving, and more. This work will prepare
students for more complex and representational math later in the instructional materials. This means that
teachers need to look at the underlying reasons why a student might have gotten a problem wrong—whether
it is an abstract reasoning skill, a literacy skill, or an impulsivity issue—and tailor instruction appropriately.

The modules in _Bluebonnet Learning_ _K–5 Math_ instructional materials are designed to effectively help
teachers analyze students’ work and provide the instructional support that best meets students’ needs.
The activities support students’ developmental needs by identifying student misconceptions and providing
guidance to address these misconceptions. This ensures that students can move away from an algorithmic,
rule-based version of math—which can often lead them astray as the concepts become more complex—
toward a more holistic competence with mathematical reasoning. For example, teachers are encouraged to
have students work in small groups on problems and explain their reasoning to one another. This approach
allows teachers and students to identify and correct misconceptions as they arise.

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 2


For students to benefit from the _Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Math_ instructional materials approach, they
need to be provided with opportunities to engage in productive struggle. This means that students
boldly and confidently learn to confront mistakes, reframe them into learning opportunities, and then
move forward, deepening their mathematical reasoning throughout the year. One of the best ways
to encourage students to embrace productive struggle is to promote a classroom culture of learning.
A culture of learning is one in which students embrace the process of productive struggle. It is also a
culture free from the common idea that “fast at math = good at math.” By creating a culture of learning
and encouraging students to view challenges as an expected and even desirable part of the learning
process, teachers can help students avoid a fear of math that could undermine the mathematical future
of many students. Instead, students can start enjoying and feeling confident in math even if their answers
do not always come quickly.


**Culture of Learning in Grade 2**

As noted in the Program and Implementation Guide, the way to engage math learners and help them embrace
the productive struggle that’s needed to learn deeply is to create a culture of learning. [1] As shown in the figure
below, a culture of learning rests on a foundation of (1) high-quality instructional materials, (2) a teacher’s
intentions, and (3) the language that communicates the intent of teachers and materials.







1 Yeager. _10 to 25_, 2024.



**3**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 2


A culture of learning can be created beginning on the first day of Module 1. A teacher can use language
that communicates their intent for all students to be supported as they are held to a high standard
for learning. [2] A culture of learning can also be maintained throughout the year since teachers will
continue to support math learners as they embrace challenge. For example, teachers can use language
that clarifies their intent of assigning the rigorous challenges students will face in the instructional
materials.


A challenge for teachers is that it can take longer to use language that supports a culture of learning _._ However,
using language that communicates a culture of learning supports students’ developmental needs and learning.
In contrast, language that communicates a culture of compliance can undermine students’ motivation
and engagement because it doesn’t fit with their developmentally appropriate desire for autonomy and
understanding. [3]












|Teacher Behavior|Language that Communicates<br>a Culture of Compliance|Language that Communicates a Culture<br>of Learning|
|---|---|---|
|Introduce the<br>next activity in the<br>lesson plan.|Do this next. You’ll get a bad<br>grade if you don’t.|This next activity will help you understand<br>the material better because ______.|
|Give students a set<br>of problems that they<br>aren’t supposed to finish<br>perfectly in the allotted<br>time (e.g. Sprint).|Just do your best.|Most of you won’t answer all these<br>problems and you might not get them all<br>correct. That’s okay. I’m trying to challenge<br>you so that I can learn what you’re<br>prepared to do and what I need to teach<br>you next.|
|Ask students to<br>explain their thinking<br>on a problem answered<br>incorrectly.|Tell me why you got this wrong.|I’d like you to explain your thinking about<br>this answer. It will help me know how<br>to explain the concept in a way that will<br>be more helpful to you. There is a good<br>chance that somebody else made the same<br>mistake, so your thinking can help the whole<br>class learn.|



The language in the second column promotes a culture of compliance. Students in grades 2 through 5 are
likely to perceive this as disrespecting their need for autonomy and independent thinking.


The language in the third column promotes a culture of learning because it supports students’ autonomy. It
implies that students can own their thinking and that they deserve valid explanations. This approach can help
students feel respected and cause them to be more motivated and engaged.

**Collaboratively Troubleshooting Student Misconceptions**

It is common for students to make mistakes as they build their understanding of new or difficult concepts.
From a student perspective, mistakes can logically occur whenever students try to apply previous learning to
new problems that require a different approach. To help students correct their thinking and develop a better
understanding, teachers can identify the knowledge that students are building on when they make a mistake.


The _Bluebonnet Learning K–5 Math_ instructional materials list common student mistakes for each module.
Teachers can use this information to troubleshoot mistakes collaboratively with students.


As noted in the Program and Implementation Guide, _collaborative troubleshooting_ is a routine to help
teachers address students’ misconceptions. The three steps to collaborative troubleshooting are


(1) surface student thinking;

(2) validate what the student did right; and

(3) bridge to a better understanding.


In Step 1, it’s helpful to ask questions to better understand what the student was thinking when they made a
decision. For example, the teacher can ask, “Can you tell me more about your thinking on this problem?” or
“I noticed you wrote ____. What were some of your reasons for doing that?”


In Step 2, it’s helpful to point out the parts of the problem that the student understood or did correctly. That
way, the student maintains their successful thinking as they retry a problem. For example, teachers can say
“I noticed you did ____ and wrote ____, and that’s great because that means you understood ____.”


Last, in Step 3, the teacher can build on the student’s assets and bridge to a better understanding. It can help
to ask guided questions that invite the student to build a stronger understanding. For example, the teacher
can ask the following questions:


⬛
“If you keep ____ [correct thinking] and changed ____ [misconception] to ____ [alternative], then
what do you think might happen?”


⬛
“What would happen if you did ____ instead of ____?”


⬛
“If ____ [correct thinking] is true, then how does that thinking affect ____ [misconception]?”


In practice, this routine may look and sound like the following teacher–student dialogue, which is based on a
misconception for Grade 2 Module 1 Topic B that is listed in the Module Overview.

_Note: Teachers can adopt this sample dialogue to other misconceptions listed in the Module Overview._

**Scenario:** A student relies on counting strategies instead of using place value knowledge to make the next ten.
The teacher has a one-on-one discussion with the student.


**Step 1: Surface student thinking.**

T: (Write 39 + 4 = ____.) What is 39 plus 4? How do you know?
S: 39 plus 4 equals 43. I counted on: thirty-nine, 40, 41, 42, 43.


**Step 2: Validate what the student did right.**

T: You’re right. You counted on from 39 to add 4 more.
T: Let’s solve this problem again using a different strategy.


**Step 3: Bridge to a better understanding.**

T: Look at the number sentence again.

S: 40.
T: 39 needs how many more to make 40?
S: 1 more.
T: Where can we get 1 more?
S: Break apart the 4.
T: (Write the number bond as shown in the image).
4 is 1 and…?
S: 3.

right of that ten, as shown. Write 39 + 1 = ____.) What is 39 plus 1?
S: 40.
T: (Write 40 to complete the number sentence). What is the other part of the number bond that
makes 4?
S: 3.
T: (Write 40 + 3 = ____.) What is 40 plus 3?
S: 43.
T: (Write 43 to complete the number sentence and the original equation).
T: Where do you see 40 and 3 in the drawing? In the equation?
S: I see 4 tens in the drawing. I also see 3 x’s, or 3 ones. That’s 40 plus 3.
T: Since 39 is close to a ten, we broke apart the other addend to make a simpler problem. It is simpler
to add 40 and 3 than to add 39 and 4. Making the next ten is a more efficient strategy than counting on.

**Assessment Reflection Tool**

An assessment reflection can be powerful in helping to surface student thinking and in helping students to
monitor and track their own growth. It can also help students anticipate and process any thoughts they may
have about completing an assessment.

The Assessment Reflection Tool can help teachers guide discussions both prior to and after an assessment.
These discussions help the teacher promote a culture of productive struggle as students go into testing. These
discussions also support students’ needs after testing and give students the opportunity to reflect on their
progress and learn from their mistakes after an assessment.

**Summary of Year**

Grade 2 mathematics is about (1) extending understanding and utility of base-ten notation; (2) building
proficiency with addition and subtraction; (3) using standard units of measure to describe length, area, and
time; (4) describing and analyzing shapes; and (5) exploring personal financial literacy.


**Rationale for Module Sequence in Grade 2**

In Grade 1, students gained addition and subtraction proficiency within 10 and experience working with
numbers to 100. Module 1 of Grade 2 begins with motivating, differentiated lessons that re-establish basic
fact automaticity to achieve proficiency of Grade 2 fluencies (i.e., adding and subtracting within 20 and within
100) by the end of the year. Students contextualize addition and subtraction as they apply strategies to solve
word problems using the Read–Draw–Write, or RDW process. Though encouraged to use math drawings that
are intuitive for them, some situations are modeled using a strip diagram, encouraging students to generalize
and analyze part–whole relationships.

In Module 2, students measure and estimate using standard length units. They discover that linear
measurement involves an iteration of units. Through exploration, students realize that the smaller the unit is,
the more iterations of that unit are necessary to cover a given length. Students work exclusively with metric
units (e.g., centimeters and meters) in this module to support upcoming work with place value concepts in
Module 3. Students relate addition and subtraction to measurement by solving word problems involving
length. Understanding units plays a central role in the addition and subtraction algorithms of Modules 4 and 5.

In Module 3, students extend their understanding of base-ten notation and apply their understanding of place
value to count and compare numbers to 1,200. In Grade 2, place value units move from a proportional model,
such as bundles of straws, to a non-proportional model, such as number disks. Students work with ones, tens,
and hundreds to build conceptual understanding of the base-ten system, which will support them through
Grade 5 as they perform more complex mathematics.

In Module 4, students apply their work with place value units to add and subtract within 200, moving from
concrete to representational to abstract. This work deepens their understanding of base ten, place value, and
the properties of operations. It also prompts them to apply their knowledge to generate and solve one-step
and multi-step word problems. During this module, students also continue to develop one of the required
fluencies of the grade: addition and subtraction within 20.

Module 5 builds upon the work of Module 4. Students again use place value strategies, manipulatives, and
math drawings to extend their conceptual understanding of the addition and subtraction algorithms to
numbers within 1,000. They maintain addition and subtraction fluency within 100 through daily application
work to solve one- and multi-step word problems of all types. A key component of Modules 4 and 5 is that
students use place value reasoning to explain why their addition and subtraction strategies work.

In Module 6, students extend their understanding of a unit to build the foundation for multiplication and division
wherein any number, not just powers of ten, can be a unit. Making equal groups of 4 apples each establishes the
unit four apples (or just four) that can then be counted: 1 four, 2 fours, 3 fours, etc. Relating the new unit to the
one used to create it lays the foundation for multiplication: 3 groups of 4 apples equals 12 apples (or 3 fours is
12). Students compose and manipulate rows and columns of an array to deepen their understanding of spatial
structuring as they build and partition rectangles with rows and columns of same-size squares, thus discovering
area. Students eventually relate repeated addition to multiplication and repeated subtraction to division.

Module 7 provides another opportunity for students to practice their problem-solving skills using algorithms.
Working with the appealing units of bills and coins reinforces place value understanding and provides reallife contexts for problem solving. Students also learn about saving and spending while comparing consumers
and producers and borrowing and lending. Measuring and estimating length is revisited in this module using
both customary units (e.g., inches and feet) and metric units (e.g., centimeters and meters). As students study
money and length, they represent measurement data and money data by creating pictographs and bar graphs.

Students finish Grade 2 describing and analyzing shapes in terms of their attributes. In Module 8, students
investigate, describe, and reason about the composition and decomposition of shapes to form other shapes.
Through building, drawing, and analyzing two- and three-dimensional shapes, students develop a foundation
for understanding area, volume, congruence, similarity, and symmetry in later grades. Students also use their
work with shapes to build an understanding of fractions (halves, fourths, and eighths). Working with fractions
allows students to tell time accurately and grasp the meaning of phrases such as “half past” and “quarter to.”

Grade 2 Module 1
###### **Tips for Families**

**Key Concepts Overview**

Focus TEKS: **2.4A, 2.4B, 2.4C, 2.7C**

The focus of Module 1 is to develop fluency as students add and subtract numbers up to 100 using place value
understanding, properties of operations, and the relationship between addition and subtraction. Your student
will:

⬜ Review and build upon familiar skills from Kindergarten and Grade 1 such as breaking apart a total,
identifying partners to 10, and adding ten plus facts.

⬜ Use number bonds to **make a ten** when adding numbers up to 100 and **take from ten** when subtracting numbers up to 100 to make simpler problems.

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages
in the Succeed Student Edition to help you support your student as they work at home.


**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
If your student would benefit from using concrete objects for support, provide pennies (or other
counters) to help him break apart numbers. The use of fingers is also encouraged!


⬛
When completing homework, encourage your student to explain how she knows the correct answer.
For example, “I know that 10 – 7 = 3, so that means 10 – 3 = 7. Three and seven are parts and 10 is
the total.”


⬛
Practice counting the Say Ten way. Say a two-digit number (e.g., 23 or 37), and ask your student to
repeat it the Say Ten way (2 tens 3; 3 tens 7). For fun, invite your student to say some numbers for
you to repeat the Say Ten way.


⬛
Help your student practice saying addition sentences for teen numbers when one addend is 10. Alternate between the regular way and the Say Ten way. For example, you say “ten 2”, and your student
will say “10 + 2 = 12.” Alternatively, you say “thirteen”, and your student will say “10 + 3 = 13.”


⬛
Encourage your student to explain one strategy he can use to solve a problem. For example, “I know
that 61 + 20 = 81 because 20 is 2 tens. I started with 61 and I counted on 2 tens: 61, 71, 81.”


⬛
Play the “Make the Next Ten” game with your student. Player A calls out a number (e.g., 28). Player B
tells how many ones are needed to make the next ten, and then says the number sentence (2; 28 + 2
= 30).


⬛
Play the “Take out 10” game with your student. Player A calls out a number (e.g., 67). Player B takes
out 10, states the remaining part (57), and provides a related number sentence (67 – 10 = 57, or 57
+ 10 = 67).


**37**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 2


**Terms**

**Like units** : units that are the same


_**Make ten**_ **and** _**take from ten**_ : Make ten is an addition strategy where you decompose one of the addends
to make a unit of ten with the other addend. Take from ten is a subtraction strategy where you subtract a
number from a unit of ten.









**Say Ten counting** : a way of counting; say the number of tens and ones. Say Ten counting can also include
hundreds; for example: 12 tens 3 or 1 hundred 2 tens 3 for 123.

Grado 2 Módulo 1
###### **Consejos Para Las Familias**

**Descripción De Los Conceptos Clave**

Enfoque de TEKS: **2.4A, 2.4B, 2.4C, 2.7C**

El enfoque del Módulo 1 es desarrollar la fluidez a medida que los estudiantes suman y restan números hasta
100 utilizando la comprensión del valor posicional, las propiedades de las operaciones y la relación entre la
suma y la resta. Su estudiante:

⬜ Revisará y desarrollará las competencias familiares de Kindergarten y 1.er grado, como separar un
total, identificar a los compañeros hasta el 10 y sumar más de diez datos.

⬜ Utilizará enlaces numéricos para **hacer una decena** al sumar números hasta 100 y **tomará de la**
**decena** al restar números hasta 100 para hacer problemas más simples.

Puede usar la lista anterior para supervisar el progreso de su estudiante en cuanto a los conocimientos y
habilidades de este módulo. En las páginas del libro de Homework Helpers de Succeed, Student Edition
encontrará problemas diarios de muestra con soluciones y burbujas de pensamiento para ayudarlo a apoyar a
su estudiante mientras trabaja en casa.


**Formas Adicionales De Ayudar En Casa**


⬛
Si su estudiante se beneficiaría del uso de objetos concretos como apoyo, preséntele monedas de un
1 centavo (u otro tipo de fichas) para ayudarlo a separar los números. ¡También animamos a usar los
dedos!


⬛
Al completar la tarea, anime a su estudiante a explicar cómo sabe la respuesta correcta. Por ejemplo,
“Sé que 10 – 7 = 3, entonces eso significa 10 – 3 = 7. Tres y siete son partes y 10 es el total”.


⬛
Practique contando a la manera de Decir Diez. Diga un número de dos dígitos (por ejemplo, 23 o
37) y pídale a su estudiante que lo repita a la manera de Decir Diez (2 decenas 3; 3 decenas 7). Por
diversión, invite a su estudiante a decir algunos números para que repita la forma de Decir Diez.


⬛
Ayude a su estudiante a practicar diciendo oraciones de suma para números del 11 al 19 cuando un
sumando es 10. Alterne entre la forma tradicional y la forma de Decir Diez. Por ejemplo, usted dice
“decena 2” y su estudiante dirá “10 + 2 = 12”. Alternativamente, usted dice “trece” y su estudiante
dirá “10 + 3 = 13”.


⬛
Anime a su estudiante a explicar una estrategia que pueda usar para resolver un problema. Por ejemplo, “Sé que 61 + 20 = 81 porque 20 es 2 decenas. Empecé con 61 y conté con 2 decenas: 61, 71, 81”.


⬛
Juegue “Hacer la siguiente decena” con su estudiante. El jugador A dice un número (por ejemplo,
28). El jugador B dice cuántas unidades se necesitan para hacer la siguiente decena, y luego dice la
oración numérica (2; 28 + 2 = 30).


⬛
Juegue a “Eliminar 10” con su estudiante. El jugador A dice un número (por ejemplo, 67). El jugador B
resta 10, indica la parte restante (57) y proporciona una oración numérica relacionada (67 – 10 = 57,

     - 57 + 10 = 67).

**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 2


**Términos**

**Unidades similares** : unidades que son iguales.


_**Hacer una decena**_ **y** _**tomar de una decena**_ : Hacer una decena es una estrategia de suma en la que se
descompone uno de los sumandos para hacer una unidad de diez con el otro sumando. Tomar de una decena
es una estrategia de resta en la que se resta un número de una unidad de diez.









**Conteo Decir diez** : una forma de contar; decir el número de decenas y unidades. El conteo Decir diez también
puede incluir centenas; por ejemplo: 12 decenas 3 o 1 centena 2 decenas 3 para 123.

Grade 2 Module 2
###### **Tips for Families**

**Key Concepts Overview**

Focus TEKS: **2.9A, 2.9B, 2.9D, 2.9E**

The focus of Module 2 is to deepen students’ understanding of measurement and to relate addition and
subtraction to length. Your student will:

⬜ Learn how to measure using centimeter cubes.

⬜ Practice the _mark and move forward_ technique using just one cube.

⬜ Measure objects with tools such as centimeter rulers, measuring tapes, and meter sticks.

⬜ **Estimate** using mental **benchmarks** .

⬜ Use different **length units** such as paper clips, crayons, and other everyday objects to measure and
compare lengths.

⬜ Reason about the relationship between unit size and measurement. For example, “ **Centimeters** are
smaller than **meters,** so it takes more centimeters than meters to measure this table.”

⬜ Solve addition and subtraction word problems involving length.

⬜ Use the ruler as a **number line** and draw **strip diagrams** to compare lengths.

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages
in the Succeed Student Edition to help you support your student as they work at home.


**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Look for practical opportunities for your student to use measurement skills at home. For example,
ask, “Will the rug fit in this room?” or “How far away should we put the basketball hoop?” Encourage
your student to measure by placing nonstandard units, such as shoes, end to end with no gaps or
overlaps. As an alternative, your student might use a standard measurement tool such as a ruler or
meter stick.


⬛
Invite your student to estimate the lengths of different objects and to share their reasoning and
benchmarks. For example, “I estimate that the table is about one meter high because it is a little bit
lower than the doorknob, which I know is about one meter high!”


⬛
Use your student’s handmade centimeter ruler to practice addition up to 30. Player A calls out two
numbers (e.g., 9 and 5). Player B uses the ruler to add the two numbers by sliding a finger up the
ruler: “I start at 9, and I slide my finger five spaces. I stop at 14 because 9 + 5 = 14.”


⬛
Count by 10 centimeters with your student. When you reach 100 centimeters, change to meters and
centimeters. For example, “...70 centimeters, 80 centimeters, 90 centimeters, 1 meter, 1 meter 10
centimeters, 1 meter 20 centimeters, 1 meter 30 centimeters, 1 meter 40 centimeters,” and so on.


**43**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 2


⬛
Play the game “Which is Shorter?” with your student. Player A says two lengths (e.g., 6 centimeters
and 10 centimeters). Player B tells which length is shorter (6 centimeters). For an added challenge,
ask your student to compare different units (e.g., 6 meters and 10 centimeters). Take turns being
Player A and Player B.


⬛
As your student draws a strip diagram to solve a word problem, ask questions such as, “How did you
label each part of your drawing?” “Which strip is longer?” and “How did you show the difference in
lengths (shorter/longer) in your drawing?”


**Terms**


**Benchmark** : a number that is said when skip-counting by 10 and starting at 0, such as 10, 20, 30, 40,

###### **Consejos Para Las Familias**

**Descripción De Los Conceptos Clave**

Enfoque de TEKS: **2.9A, 2.9B, 2.9D, 2.9E**

El objetivo del Módulo 2 es profundizar en la comprensión de los estudiantes sobre la medición y relacionar la
suma y la resta con la longitud. Su estudiante:

⬜ Aprenderá a medir usando cubos de centímetros.

⬜ Practicará la técnica de _marcar y avanzar_ usando solo un cubo.

⬜ Medirá objetos con herramientas como reglas, cintas métricas y varillas de medición.

⬜ **Estimará** utilizando **puntos de referencia** mentales.

⬜ Usará diferentes **unidades de longitud**, como clips para papeles, crayones y otros objetos cotidianos,
para medir y comparar longitudes.

⬜ Razonará sobre la relación entre el tamaño de la unidad y la medición. Por ejemplo, “Los **centímetros**
son más pequeños que los **metros,** por lo que se necesitan más centímetros que metros para medir
esta tabla”.

⬜ Resolverá problemas escritos de suma y resta que involucren longitud.

⬜ Utilizará la regla como una **recta numérica** y dibujará **diagramas de tiras** para comparar longitudes.

Puede usar la lista anterior para supervisar el progreso de su estudiante en cuanto a los conocimientos y
habilidades de este módulo. En las páginas del libro de Homework Helpers de Succeed, Student Edition
encontrará problemas diarios de muestra con soluciones y burbujas de pensamiento para ayudarlo a apoyar
a su estudiante mientras trabaja en casa.


**Formas Adicionales De Ayudar En Casa**


⬛
Busque oportunidades prácticas para que su estudiante use las competencias de medición en casa.
Por ejemplo, pregunte: “¿La alfombra cabrá en esta habitación?” o “¿A qué distancia debemos poner
el aro de baloncesto?” Anime a su estudiante a medir colocando unidades no estandarizadas, como
zapatos, de un extremo a otro, sin espacios o uno encima de otro. Como alternativa, su estudiante
podría usar una herramienta de medición estandarizada, como una regla o un medidor.


⬛
Invite a su estudiante a estimar las longitudes de diferentes objetos y a compartir su razonamiento y
puntos de referencia. Por ejemplo, “¡Estimo que la mesa tiene aproximadamente un metro de altura
porque es un poco más baja que el pomo de la puerta, que sé que tiene aproximadamente un metro
de altura!”


⬛
Use la regla de centímetros hecha a mano por su estudiante para practicar la suma hasta el 30. El
jugador A dirá dos números (por ejemplo, 9 y 5). El jugador B debe usar la regla para sumar los dos
números deslizando un dedo por la regla: “Empiezo en 9 y deslizo mi dedo cinco espacios. Me detengo en 14, porque 9 + 5 = 14”.


**46**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 2


⬛
Cuente de 10 en 10 centímetros con su estudiante. Cuando llegue a los 100 centímetros, cambien a
metros y centímetros. Por ejemplo, “...70 centímetros, 80 centímetros, 90 centímetros, 1 metro,
1 metro 10 centímetros, 1 metro 20 centímetros, 1 metro 30 centímetros, 1 metro 40 centímetros”,
y así sucesivamente.


⬛
Juegue a “¿Cuál es más corto?” con su estudiante. El jugador A debe decir dos longitudes (por ejemplo, 6 centímetros y 10 centímetros). El jugador B indica qué longitud es más corta (6 centímetros).
Para un reto adicional, pídale a su estudiante que compare diferentes unidades (por ejemplo, 6 metros y 10 centímetros). Tomen turnos siendo el Jugador A y el Jugador B.


⬛
Conforme su estudiante dibuje un diagrama de tiras para resolver un problema escrito, haga preguntas como: “¿Cómo etiquetaste cada parte de tu dibujo?”. “¿Qué tira es más larga?” y “¿Cómo
mostraste la diferencia en longitudes (más corta/más larga) en tu dibujo?”


**Términos**

**Punto de referencia** : un número que se dice cuando se cuenta de 10 en 10 y comienza en 0, como 10, 20, 30,
40, 50, 60, etc.





**Punto final** : un punto donde algo comienza o termina.

Grade 2 Module 3
###### **Tips for Families**

**Key Concepts Overview**

Focus TEKS: **2.2A, 2.2B, 2.2C, 2.2D, 2.2E**

The focus of Module 3 is developing place value understanding of numbers up to 1,200 and applying that
understanding by using concrete and pictorial models, comparing and ordering numbers, and representing
numbers using standard, expanded, and word forms. Your student will:

⬜ Develop knowledge of **place value units** of ones, tens, and hundreds and the new unit of a thousand.

⬜ Learn to **skip-count** efficiently by reaching a **benchmark number** —a ten or a hundred.

⬜ Explore the value of three-digit numbers and learn to name numbers in **standard**, **unit**, **expanded**,
and **word form** .

⬜ Deepen place value understanding by drawing comparisons between ones, tens, and hundreds, and
$1, $10, and $100 bills.

⬜ Exchange units of equal value, for example, 30 ones for 3 tens, or 4 hundreds for 40 tens.

⬜ Compare and order whole numbers by using the words _greater than_, _less than_, or _equal to_ as well as
the comparison symbols (>, <, =).

⬜ Identify 1, 10, or 100 more or less than a given number.

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages
in the Succeed Student Edition to help you support your student as they work at home.


**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Encourage your student to practice skip-counting by tens and by hundreds, up to 1,000, starting at
any number. When your student begins demonstrating strong, consistent abilities, ask him to name
the ending number in unit form as well as in standard form.


⬛
Practice counting in unit form. Player A says a number (e.g., 234), and Player B repeats it in unit form
(2 hundreds 3 tens 4 ones). Take turns with your student being Player A and Player B.


⬛
Play board games that incorporate counting money. Focus particularly on $1, $10, and $100 bills.


⬛
Use board game money to show a three-digit value (e.g., 243). Have your student use standard form
(243), unit form (2 hundreds 4 tens 3 ones), and expanded form to name the value. Vary the order
of the bills so your student can practice unit form and expanded form out of unit order (e.g., 4 tens
3 ones 2 hundreds; 40 + 3 + 200 = 243).


⬛
Encourage your student to solve problems (e.g., 37 + 8) by using the make ten addition strategy. Then
ask her to explain the solution strategy. For example, “I know that 37 needs 3 to make 40, and I can
break 8 into 3 and 5. My new, simpler problem is 40 + 5, which is 45.”


**49**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 2


⬛
Play the “Guess My Number” game with your student. Think of a number, but don’t tell your student.
Give clues such as using 1 more, 10 more, 100 more, 1 less, 10 less, or 100 less to help your student
determine the mystery number. As he becomes more proficient, use clues that challenge him to cross

**Formas Adicionales De Ayudar En Casa**


⬛
Anime a su estudiante a practicar el contar salteado por decenas y por centenas, hasta 1,000, comenzando en cualquier número. Cuando su estudiante comience a demostrar competencias sólidas y
consistentes, pídale que nombre el número final en forma unitaria, así como en forma estandarizada.


⬛
Practiquen el conteo en forma unitaria. El jugador A dice un número (por ejemplo, 234), y el jugador
B lo repite en forma unitaria (2 centenas, 3 decenas, 4 unidades). Tomen turnos con su estudiante
siendo el jugador A y el jugador B.


⬛
Jueguen a juegos de mesa que involucren el contar dinero. Concéntrese particularmente en los
billetes de $1, $10 y $100.


**52**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 2


⬛
Utilice el dinero del juego de mesa para mostrar un valor de tres dígitos (por ejemplo, 243). Haga que
su estudiante use la forma estandarizada (243), la forma unitaria (2 centenas, 4 decenas, 3 unidades)
y la forma desarrollada para nombrar el valor. Varíe el orden de los billetes para que su estudiante
pueda practicar la forma unitaria y la forma desarrollada fuera del orden de la unidad (por ejemplo,
4 decenas, 3 unidades, 2 centenas; 40 + 3 + 200 = 243).


⬛
Anime a su estudiante a resolver problemas (por ejemplo, 37 + 8) utilizando la estrategia de hacer
decenas para sumar. Luego, pídale que explique la estrategia de la solución. Por ejemplo, “Sé que 37
necesita 3 para hacer 40, y puedo dividir 8 en 3 y 5. Mi nuevo problema, más simple, es 40 + 5, que
es 45”.


⬛
Juegue a “Adivina mi número” con su estudiante. Piense en un número, pero no se lo diga a su

­estudiante. Dé pistas como usar 1 más, 10 más, 100 más, 1 menos, 10 menos o 100 menos para

ayudar a su estudiante a determinar el número misterioso. A medida que se vuelva más hábil,
utilice pistas que le reten a superar la centena. Por ejemplo, “Mi número es 10 menos que 402”

    - “Mi número es 10 más que 392”.

Grade 2 Module 4
###### **Tips for Families**

**Key Concepts Overview**

Focus TEKS: **2.4B, 2.4C, 2.4D, 2.7B, 2.7C**

In Module 4, students use their knowledge of place value and properties of operations to build fluency in
two-digit addition and subtraction within 100, and to solve one- and two-step word problems within 100. This
module also builds students’ understanding of addition and subtraction of multi-digit numbers within 200.
Your student will:

⬜ Learn **simplifying strategies** to develop fluency.

⬜ Learn how to add vertically with a focus on building lasting place value understanding.

⬜ Model and record the steps of the **vertical form** by using **place value disks** on a place value chart.

⬜ Use drawings of place value disks and the **chip model** to show place value concepts at work.

⬜ Subtract vertically by aligning place value units.

⬜ **Compose**, or bundle, tens and hundreds when adding.

⬜ Use known facts, such as 5 + 8 = 13 (5 ones + 8 ones = 13 ones), to solve more complex problems,
such as 50 + 80 = 130 (5 tens + 8 tens = 13 tens).

⬜ Deepen their understanding of the repetitive nature of the subtraction **algorithm**, unbundling 1 hundred for 10 tens and 1 ten for 10 ones when necessary.

⬜ Compare and discuss the various strategies for adding and subtracting up to 200.

⬜ Learn about an addition method called **totals below** .

⬜ Solve and create one- and two-step word problems.

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages
in the Succeed Student Edition to help you support your student as they work at home.


**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Practice place value understanding by asking your student to tell how many ones, tens, and hundreds are
in various numbers. For example, you say, “134,” and your student responds, “4 ones, 3 tens, 1 hundred.”


⬛
Invite your student to find the missing part to make the next ten. For example, ask, “How much does
7 need to make 10?” (3) Then say, “Tell me the number sentence.” (7 + 3 = 10) Continue with 17, 27,
37, and so on. Repeat this activity with other sequences, starting small and building to larger numbers up to 100.


⬛
Encourage your student to explain what she is doing when solving problems to reinforce place value
language. For example, ask, “How did you know you needed (or didn’t need) to bundle in the ones
place?” “I knew I needed to bundle in the ones place because 7 ones plus 5 ones equals 12 ones.
That’s 1 ten 2 ones.”


**55**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 2


⬛
Help your student practice knowing when to unbundle a ten by playing the game “Take from the Tens
or Ones” with him. For example, if you say, “46 – 5,” your student should say, “Take from the ones.” If
you say, “46 – 7,” your student should say, “Take from the tens.”


⬛
When your student sees a number that is close to the next ten (one that ends in 7, 8, or 9), suggest
she use a simplifying strategy rather than the vertical form. For example, to solve 58 + 63, ask your
student, “How can you make the next ten to solve a simpler problem?” (60 + 61).


⬛
Use consistent language to help your student through the subtraction process. For example, to solve
172 – 56, you might say, “Let’s look at the ones place first. Do you have enough ones to subtract 6
ones?” (No, because 6 ones are more than 2 ones.) “Where can you get more ones?” (From the tens
place.) “Show what happens in the tens place.” (7 tens becomes 6 tens.) “How many ones do you
have in the ones place now?” (12 ones.) Continue with, “Now, let’s look at the tens place. Do you
have enough tens to subtract 5 tens?” (Yes, because there are 6 tens.) And so on. Encourage your
student to use place value language to respond and have them record their work.


**Terms**

**Algorithm** ( _Algoritmo_ ): a step-by-step procedure to solve a particular type of problem









**Simplifying strategy** ( _Strategia para simplificar_ ): a way of thinking about a problem that makes it simpler to
find the value (e.g., to solve 26 + 30, think 20 + 30 = 50 and 50 + 6 = 56)

**Formas Adicionales De Ayudar En Casa**


⬛
Practique la comprensión del valor posicional pidiéndole a su estudiante que diga cuántas unidades,
decenas y centenas hay en varios números. Por ejemplo, usted dice “134” y su estudiante responde
“4 unidades, 3 decenas, 1 centena”.


⬛
Invite a su estudiante a encontrar la parte que falta para hacer la próxima decena. Por ejemplo, pregunte: “¿Cuánto necesita 7 para hacer 10?”. (3) Luego, diga: “Dime la oración numérica”. (7 + 3 = 10)


**58**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 2


Continúe con 17, 27, 37, y así sucesivamente. Repita esta actividad con otras secuencias, comenzando con números pequeños y aumentando a números más grandes hasta 100.


⬛
Anime a su estudiante a explicar lo que está haciendo al resolver problemas para reforzar el lenguaje del valor posicional. Por ejemplo, pregunte: “¿Cómo sabías que necesitabas (o no necesitabas)
agrupar en el lugar de unidades?”. “Sabía que tenía que agrupar en el lugar de las unidades porque
7 unidades más 5 unidades equivalen a 12 unidades. Eso es 1 decena y 2 unidades”.


⬛
Ayude a su estudiante a practicar cuándo desagregar una decena jugando “Tomar de las decenas o
de las unidades” con él. Por ejemplo, si usted dice, “46 – 5”, su estudiante debe decir, “Toma de las
unidades”. Si usted dice: “46 – 7”, su estudiante debe decir: “Toma de las decenas”.


⬛
Cuando su estudiante vea un número que esté cerca de la siguiente decena (uno que termine en 7, 8

     - 9), sugiérale que use una estrategia simplificadora en lugar de la forma vertical. Por ejemplo, para
resolver 58 + 63, pregunte a su estudiante: “¿Cómo puedes hacer la próxima decena para resolver un
problema más simple?”. (60 + 61).


⬛
Use un lenguaje consistente para ayudar a su estudiante durante el proceso de resta. Por ejemplo,
para resolver 172 – 56, podría decir: “Veamos primero el lugar de las unidades. ¿Tienes suficientes
unidades para restar 6? (No, porque 6 unidades son más de 2 unidades). “¿Dónde puedes conseguir
más?” (Desde el lugar de las decenas). “Muestra lo que sucede en el lugar de las decenas”. (7 decenas se convierten en 6 decenas). “¿Cuántas unidades tienes en el lugar de las unidades ahora?”.
(12 unidades). Siga con: “Ahora, veamos el lugar de las decenas. ¿Tienes suficientes decenas para
restar 5 decenas?”. (Sí, porque hay 6 decenas). Y así sucesivamente. Anime a su estudiante a usar
un lenguaje de valor posicional para responder y pídale que registre su trabajo.

In Module 5 students continue renaming place value units and extend their work with addition and
subtraction algorithms to numbers within 1,000. Your student will:

⬜ Model addition and subtraction with materials and drawings.

⬜ Relate _100 more_ and _100 less_ to addition and subtraction of 100.

⬜ Use simplifying strategies for addition and subtraction.

⬜ Extend the _make a ten_ strategy to make a hundred.

⬜ Use **compensation** to subtract from three-digit numbers.

⬜ Use place value language to explain why strategies work.

⬜ Add two- and three-digit numbers up to 1,000 by bundling, or composing, units to make a new ten
or a new hundred.

⬜ Subtract two- and three-digit numbers up to 1,000 by decomposing (i.e. unbundling) tens and hundreds.

⬜ Solve and create one- and two-step word problems involving addition and subtraction.

⬜ Choose which strategy is most efficient for a given problem, understanding that the strategies they
used with one-step problems also work with multi-step word problems.

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages
in the Succeed Student Edition to help you support your student as they work at home.


**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Encourage your student to use place value language to explain how adding in the tens place is like
adding in the ones place. “When I have a group of 10 ones, I can make a group of 1 ten. When I have
a group of 10 tens, I can make a group of 1 hundred.”


⬛
Before your student adds or subtracts, ask her to look closely at the numbers and think aloud about
which strategy will be most efficient and why. For example, she might choose to use the arrow way,
number bonds, counting on, or vertical form to solve.


⬛
Invite your student to explain his simplifying strategy step-by-step. For example, when he uses the
arrow way, ask your student questions such as, “How many more do you need to make the next hundred? The next ten?” and “Which did you add first: hundreds, tens, or ones? Why?”


⬛
Ask your student the following questions as she completes her homework: “Do you have enough
ones or tens to bundle?” “Where do you record the new ten or hundred in the chip model?” “How
do we show this change when using vertical form?” As your student becomes more confident, invite
her to show and explain the two models.


**61**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 2


⬛
Encourage your student to think carefully about the numbers in a given problem before choosing a
strategy. Ask him to look for numbers that are close to the next hundred or numbers from which it
would be more efficient to count on. For example, he might notice that counting on is another way
to solve the problem (802 – 698): 698 + 2 = 700; 700 + 100 = 800; 800 + 2 = 802. By counting on
104 (2 + 100 + 2), your student is using addition to solve the subtraction problem.

If your student has not yet mastered certain strategies, encourage her to solve a problem by using a
familiar strategy first. Then, present the challenge of solving the same problem by using a strategy
she is working to master.

In Module 6, students develop foundational understanding of multiplication and division. They also begin to build an
understanding of area and the meaning of even and odd numbers. Your student will:

⬜ Create equal groups using objects and drawings.

⬜ Write **repeated addition** sentences to match drawings of equal groups.

⬜ Draw strip diagrams to represent equal groups.

⬜ Use equal groups to create **arrays** and describe the arrays in terms of **rows** and **columns** .

⬜ Use arrays and strip diagrams to model and solve word problems.

⬜ Use drawings and a number line to show division situations and relate them to **repeated subtraction** .

⬜ Find the **area** of a rectangle by counting **square units** .

⬜ Use square tiles and drawings to **compose** and **decompose** rectangular arrays to show equal rows
and equal columns.

⬜ Pair objects and skip-count by twos to investigate **even** and **odd numbers** .

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages
in the Succeed Student Edition to help you support your student as they work at home.


**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Encourage your student to skip-count by twos and fives while he washes his hair, gets dressed, or
does other daily chores. For example, ask him to start at zero and skip-count by fives up to 50 and
then back to zero: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 0. If your
student shows proficiency of skip-counting by fives, challenge him to skip-count by threes and fours
in preparation for Grade 3. To provide support, try starting the skip-counting and then encourage
your student to join in.


⬛
Give your student 12 counters (e.g., pennies, buttons). Invite her to form equal groups of counters.
Ask, “How many equal groups are there? How many are in each group?” She might say, for example,
“There are 2 groups of 6 pennies.” Then challenge her to make equal groups with the same number
of pennies in a different configuration (e.g., 6 groups of 2, or 3 groups of 4).


⬛
Look for arrays in your home or community, such as rows or columns of building blocks, cupcakes in
a bakery, or windows on a building. Encourage your student to use the words _rows_ or _columns_ to describe how many are in the array; for example, “I see 4 rows of 3 cupcakes!” For an added challenge,
invite your student to use a repeated addition equation to describe the array (e.g., 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12).


**67**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 2


⬛
Give your student up to 20 counters, such as pennies or beans. Invite him to arrange a given number
of counters (e.g., 7 counters) in as many pairs as possible to determine whether the total number is
even or odd. Ask your student to share his reasoning. For example, “The number 7 is not even because there’s a penny left over when I make pairs.”


⬛
Practice Happy Counting with your student. Point up (to count up) or down (to count down) repeatedly and rhythmically to help your student practice skip-counting by twos or fives in a fun and
energetic way. Consider Happy Counting by threes or fours when your student is ready for a bigger
challenge.


⬛
To prepare your student for working with money in Module 7, play the game “Coin Drop” with her.
Gather 10 dimes and 30 pennies and a metal or plastic container. Invite your student to watch, listen
carefully, and count mentally as you drop a certain number of pennies, one at a time, into the container.
Increase the complexity for your student by dropping dimes and then a combination of dimes and pennies. After each round, ask, “How much money is in the can?” Count together to confirm the total.

**Formas Adicionales De Ayudar En Casa**


⬛
Anime a su estudiante a contar salteado, de dos en dos y de cinco en cinco, mientras se lava el cabello, se viste o hace otras tareas diarias. Por ejemplo, pídale que comience en cero y cuente de cinco
en cinco hasta 50 y luego vuelva a cero: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20,
15, 10, 5, 0. Si su estudiante muestra dominio del conteo salteado de cinco en cinco, rételo a contar
salteado de tres en cuatro en preparación para el tercer grado. Para brindar apoyo, intente comenzar
a contar salteado y luego anime a su estudiante a que lo acompañe.


⬛
Dé a su estudiante 12 fichas (por ejemplo, monedas de un centavo, botones). Invítelo a formar
grupos iguales de fichas. Pregunte: “¿Cuántos grupos iguales hay? ¿Cuántos hay en cada grupo?”. Él
podría decir, por ejemplo, “Hay 2 grupos de 6 centavos”. Luego, desafíelo a hacer grupos iguales con
el mismo número de centavos en un arreglo diferente (por ejemplo, 6 grupos de 2 o 3 grupos de 4).


⬛
Busque matrices en su hogar o comunidad, como filas o columnas de bloques de construcción, cupcakes en una panadería o ventanas en un edificio. Anime a su estudiante a usar las palabras _filas_     

**71**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 2


_columnas_ para describir cuántas hay en la matriz, por ejemplo, “¡Veo 4 filas de 3 cupcakes!”. Para un
reto adicional, invite a su estudiante a usar una ecuación de suma repetida para describir la matriz
(por ejemplo, 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12).


⬛
Dé a su estudiante hasta 20 fichas, como monedas de un centavo o frijoles. Invítelo a organizar un
número determinado de fichas (por ejemplo, 7 fichas) en tantos pares como sea posible para determinar si el número total es par o impar. Pídale a su estudiante que comparta su razonamiento. Por
ejemplo, “El número 7 no es par porque me sobra un centavo cuando hago pares”.


⬛
Practique el conteo feliz con su estudiante. Apunte hacia arriba (para contar de forma ascendente) o
hacia abajo (para contar de forma descendente) repetida y rítmicamente para ayudar a su estudiante
a practicar el conteo salteado de dos en dos o de cinco en cinco de una manera divertida y enérgica.
Considere la posibilidad de contar de tres en tres o de cuatro en cuatro cuando su estudiante esté
listo para un reto mayor.


⬛
Para preparar a su estudiante para trabajar con dinero en el Módulo 7, juegue a “Coin Drop” con él.
Reúna 10 monedas de diez centavos y 30 centavos y un recipiente de metal o plástico. Invite a su
estudiante a observar, escuchar con atención y contar mentalmente mientras deja caer una cierta
cantidad de centavos, uno a la vez, en el recipiente. Aumente la complejidad para su estudiante
dejando caer monedas de diez centavos y luego una combinación de monedas de diez centavos y
centavos. Después de cada ronda, pregunte: “¿Cuánto dinero hay en la lata?”. Cuenten juntos para
confirmar el total.

**2.11A, 2.11B, 2.11C, 2.11D, 2.11E, 2.11F**

In Module 7, students use addition and subtraction strategies within 100 and problem-solving skills as they
learn to work with various types of units within the contexts of length, money, and data. An exploration of
personal financial literacy is also included in this module. Your student will:

⬜ Learn to sort pictures and information into categories and to record that **data** in a **table** .

⬜ Create and use **pictographs** and **bar graphs** to organize and represent a data set with up to 4 categories per graph.

⬜ Count the total value of a group of coins, skip-counting by fives and tens as needed.

⬜ Learn to make change from one dollar by using counting on and simplifying strategies (e.g., the arrow
way).

⬜ Solve one- and two-step word problems involving money and length.

⬜ Consider saving as an alternative to spending and learn how money saved can grow into a larger sum
over time.

⬜ Compare **deposit** and **withdrawal**, **consumer** and **producer**, and **borrowing** and **lending** .

⬜ Learn about the **inch** as a unit of length and understand that 12 inches form a larger unit called a **foot** .

⬜ Measure using both customary units of length (e.g., inches, feet, **yards** ) and metric units of length
(e.g., centimeters, meters), choosing appropriate tools to measure each object efficiently.

⬜ Generate mental benchmarks for customary units; for example, the width of a quarter is about
1 inch, and the length of a sheet of paper is about 1 foot.

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages
in the Succeed Student Edition to help you support your student as they work at home.


**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Invite your student to create a pictograph for different types of coins. Give her a small handful of
pennies, dimes, nickels, and quarters, and ask her to sort and organize the coins by type. Encourage
your student to draw a pictograph on paper to represent how many of each type of coin are in the
groups.


⬛
Help your student practice making one dollar or making change from one dollar by asking him
questions such as, “If I have 35¢, how much more do I need to have 100¢, or one dollar?” Give your
student coins to show how he counts on to one dollar and challenge him to record his work by using
the arrow way.


**75**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 2


⬛
Play an estimation game with your student. Challenge her to estimate the length of household
objects, and then have her measure each object to see how close her estimate is to the actual
measurement.


⬛
Play the “Roll and Follow the Rule” game to help your student maintain or build fluency with addition and subtraction. Give your student a base number such as 9, and then have him roll a die to find
the rule. (If a die is not available, the game may be played using a random number generator on a
smart phone.) For example, if he rolls a 5, he adds 5 repeatedly: 9 + 5 = 14, 14 + 5 = 19, 19 + 5 = 24.
Have your student record as many number sentences as he can for 30 seconds and then switch to
a different base number and roll the die for a new rule. Play again with subtraction, starting with a
base number such as 40. For example, if your student rolls a 2, he subtracts 2 repeatedly: 40 – 2 = 38,
38 – 2 = 36, 36 – 2 = 34.

**Formas Adicionales De Ayudar En Casa**


⬛
Invite a su estudiante a crear una pictografía para diferentes tipos de monedas. Dele un pequeño
puñado de monedas de un centavo, diez centavos, cinco centavos y veinticinco centavos, y pídale que


**78**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 2


clasifique y organice las monedas por tipo. Anime a su estudiante a dibujar una pictografía en papel
para representar cuántas de cada tipo de moneda hay en los grupos.


⬛
Ayude a su estudiante a practicar haciendo un dólar o haciendo cambio de un dólar formulando preguntas como: “Si tengo 35 centavos, ¿cuánto más necesito para tener 100 centavos o un dólar?” Dé
a su estudiante monedas para mostrarle cómo cuenta con un dólar y anímelo a registrar su trabajo
usando el método de flecha.


⬛
Juegue un juego de estimación con su estudiante. Anímelo a estimar la longitud de los objetos en
casa y luego pídale que mida cada objeto para ver qué tan cerca está su estimación de la medición
real.


⬛
Juegue el juego “Rodar y seguir la regla” para ayudar a su estudiante a mantener o desarrollar la
fluidez con la suma y la resta. Dé a su estudiante un número base, como 9, y luego pídale que tire un
dado para encontrar la regla. (Si no tiene un dado disponible, el juego se puede llevar a cabo utilizando un generador de números aleatorios en un smartphone). Por ejemplo, si saca un 5, debe sumar 5
repetidamente: 9 + 5 = 14, 14 + 5 = 19, 19 + 5 = 24. Haga que su estudiante registre tantas oraciones
numéricas como pueda durante 30 segundos y luego cambie a un número base diferente y tire el
dado para una nueva regla. Vuelva a jugar con la resta, comenzando con un número base como
40. Por ejemplo, si su estudiante saca un 2, debe restar 2 repetidamente: 40 – 2 = 38, 38 – 2 = 36,
36 – 2 = 34.

In Module 8, students explore two- and three-dimensional geometric shapes, identifying their attributes to
sort, classify, and compare. They will study how shapes can be put together to form new shapes and how they
can be partitioned, or divided, into equal fractional parts. Students will use their understanding of fraction
concepts to tell time. Your student will:

⬜ Use attributes such as the number of sides or **angles** to describe various shapes.

⬜ Use attributes to build different **polygons** including triangles, **quadrilaterals**, **pentagons**, and hexagons.

⬜ Use attributes to identify and draw different quadrilaterals including rectangles, rhombuses, **parallel-**
**ograms**, and trapezoids.

⬜ Use a tangram puzzle to explore how smaller shapes can be put together to form different shapes
and to recognize that smaller parts make up a **whole** .

⬜ **Partition** shapes into equal parts and describe those parts as halves, fourths, or **eighths** .

⬜ Partition a circle into halves and quarters to make a paper clock and tell time to the half hour and
**quarter** hour.

⬜ Tell time to the nearest five minutes and relate **a.m.** and **p.m.** to time of day.

You can use the checklist above to help monitor your student’s progress of the knowledge and skills in this
module. Daily sample problems with solutions and thought bubbles are found in the Homework Helper pages
in the Succeed Student Edition to help you support your student as they work at home.


**Additional Ways to Help at Home**


⬛
Go on a shape hunt around town. Challenge your student to spot as many two- and three-dimensional shapes as she can and to prove she is correct by naming the attributes that define the shape. For
example, she might spot a street sign and say, “I see a rectangle! It has 4 sides and 4 right angles!”


⬛
Consider going to the library or bookstore to get _Grandfather Tang’s Story_, by Ann Tompert. Read the
book with your student and invite him to use his tangram pieces to make the shapes shown in the
book.


⬛
Help your student make real-world connections to math by asking questions such as, “Can you think
of any objects that are made up of several smaller shapes?” (e.g., tile floors, brick walls, the sections
of an orange), “When would you want to have equal shares of something?” (e.g., sharing food, such
as a pizza), and “Where do you see examples of halves, fourths, or eighths?” (e.g., a blanket or towel
folded in half, a newspaper folded into quarters, 1 cube in a stick of 4 linking cubes).


**81**


**BLUEBONNET LEARNING K–5 MATH** COURSE GUIDE 2


⬛
Help your student make connections between fractions and telling time. You might ask questions
such as, “Why is 15 minutes called a quarter hour?”, “How do you know that 3:45 and a quarter to
4 represent the same time?”, and “Why is it called the half hour when the minute hand points to
the 6?”

**Formas Adicionales De Ayudar En Casa**


⬛
Hagan una búsqueda de formas por la ciudad. Rete a su estudiante a detectar tantas formas bidimensionales y tridimensionales como pueda y a demostrar que tiene razón nombrando los atributos que
definen la forma. Por ejemplo, podría ver un letrero de la calle y decir: “¡Veo un rectángulo! ¡Tiene 4
lados y 4 ángulos rectos!”.
