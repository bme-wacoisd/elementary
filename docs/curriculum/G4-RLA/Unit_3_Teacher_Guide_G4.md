**Grade 4 | Unit 3**
###### Introduction


~~**CONTEMPORARY FICTION**~~


This introduction includes background information needed to teach the _Contemporary Fiction_ unit _._

Contemporary fiction is fiction that is set in the present day. This unit is students’ first opportunity

in the program to conduct an in-depth study of this genre. This unit should take no more than 15 days

and contains twelve daily lessons, a culminating activity that serves as a unit assessment, and two

Pausing Point days for differentiated instruction. Lessons and activities address various aspects of a

comprehensive language arts curriculum. Each lesson requires 90 minutes.


~~**WHY THIS UNIT IS IMPORTANT**~~


Lydia Gil’s novel _Letters from Heaven/Cartas del Cielo_ centers on the main character’s, Celeste’s,

journey after losing her grandmother. Celeste mysteriously receives letters from her grandmother,

containing recipes for some of the family’s favorite Cuban dishes. As she cooks her way through

these dishes, Celeste begins to understand the importance of her grandmother’s traditions.

Students encounter a range of English and Spanish vocabulary, authentic recipes, and varied

sentence structures with predominantly longer sentences that contain clauses and communicate

the relationship between ideas. Use of this text with the G4 unit _Contemporary Fiction_ calls for the

unit’s tasks and activities to contain some complexity. For more information about the quantitative

and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text

Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


In the novel, Celeste learns about the importance of the cooking traditions passed down by her

grandmother who is no longer living. As a result, several excerpts from the text deal with loss and

nostalgia. One excerpt features a bully character. Work with your school’s administration or counselor

to support students who may be dealing with these issues or for support with additional lessons.

Remind students of the consequences of bullying and the negative impacts of bullying on victims.


**Prior Knowledge**


Students who have received instruction in the program in Grades K–3 and up to this point in Grade

4 will already have pertinent background knowledge for this unit. These students may have gained

relevant background knowledge during the following units:


**Fairy Tales and Folktales (Kindergarten)**


**Sharing Stories (Grade 1)**


Introduction
**1**


**2**



**Fairy Tales (Grade 1)**


**Fairy Tales and Tall Tales (Grade 2)**


**Classic Tales:** _**The Wind in the Willows**_ **(Grade 3)**


**Personal Narratives (Grade 4)**


~~**ACTIVITY BOOK**~~


The Activity Book includes activity pages tied to each lesson and specific excerpts from the novel.

Activity pages allow students to review material, answer questions, complete activities designed

to increase their comprehension of that material, and compose original writing. A key objective

of the unit is teaching students to write narrative prose, which allows for creative expression and

the opportunity to implement skills learned in the lessons’ reading components. Throughout the

unit, students apply literary elements they explore in each excerpt; for example, using detailed

descriptions, building a theme, and analyzing the contrast between different characters’ perceptions.

Students also compose a personal narrative through several lessons devoted to planning, drafting,

and revising their work. In addition, students practice opinion writing using evidence from the text.


The Activity Book reinforces the unit’s integration of reading and writing literature. By synthesizing

these components, students will see that reading, writing, and understanding literature are inherently

connected. The unit’s final lesson sets students up to compose their own text in the Activity Book’s

extra pages.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


The Teacher Guide includes daily lessons with detailed directions for comprehensive instruction.

Lessons, instruction, and exercises should be taught in the order listed. The lessons also suggest

group configurations (e.g., whole group, small group, partners, independent). Use your discretion in

following the grouping suggestions and consider students’ needs.


**Vocabulary**


The Teacher Guide identifies two types of vocabulary: Core and Literary. Core Vocabulary words

appear in the excerpts and are needed to understand their meaning. Literary Vocabulary words appear

directly in the lesson and are used to read and interpret literature. Both sets of vocabulary are defined

in both the glossary and the lesson in which they appear.


**Activity Types**


Reading activities ask students to engage with text in various ways. Students read silently and aloud,

with partners, in groups of varying sizes, and independently. They practice many approaches to the


Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven


text, including answering questions to measure and expand comprehension, using graphic organizers

to gather and compare information, and using visuals to demonstrate their reading of a richly detailed

text. The reading activities are intentionally varied to demonstrate many different methods for

exploring literature.


Writing activities take two forms. The first trains students in the craft of narrative, celebrating their creative

potential while teaching them to apply and master their knowledge from understanding the unit’s excerpts.

The second asks students to write opinion statements backed by clear evidence.


Speaking and Listening activities help develop students’ capacity for oral expression.


~~**WRITING**~~ ~~**TEKS 4.2.C**~~


In Grade 4, students will write legibly in cursive to complete assignments. Writing legibly includes

knowledge of how to connect letters, using appropriate spacing and letter height. In order to master

these skills, encourage students to complete activities in cursive throughout the unit.


~~**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS**~~


This unit’s lessons feature text-dependent comprehension questions:


Literal questions assess students’ recall of key details from the text by paraphrasing and/or referring

to the text where the answer is provided.


Inferential questions ask students to infer information from the text and to think critically. These questions

require students to draw connections that demonstrate comprehension of the text. They require students

to summarize and/or refer to portions of the text that lead to and support their inferences.


Evaluative questions ask students to build on what they have learned from the text using analytical

and application skills, often to form an opinion or make a judgment. These require students to

paraphrase and/or refer to portions of the text that substantiate their argument or opinion.


~~**DIFFERENTIATED INSTRUCTION**~~


Opportunities for differentiation feature prominently in the program. We provide multiple suggestions

to support and challenge students through optional questions, activities, and information labeled

“Support” and “Challenge.” Emergent Bilingual Students support sidebars provide differentiated

prompts for students in different phases of English acquisition. Use these opportunities to address

whole-class and individual student needs.


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.


Introduction
**3**


**4**



The unit provides instruction for two Pausing Point days, which provide opportunities for remediation

and enrichment based on students’ needs. You may offer these opportunities to individual students,

small groups, or the whole class.


~~**SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS**~~


Whenever a lesson suggests displaying materials, please choose the most convenient and effective

method. You might make a transparency of the material and use an overhead projector; scan the page

and project it on an interactive, electronic surface; or write the material on the board/chart paper.


Additionally, students may use the lined pages in the back of the Activity Book, or you may provide

students with grade-appropriate writing paper.


~~**BIOGRAPHY**~~


**Lydia Gil**


Lydia Gil was born to Cuban parents in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico. She has published one bilingual

children’s book, _Mimí’s Parranda / La parranda de Mimí_, and one bilingual novel, _Letters from Heaven /_

_Cartas del cielo._ She holds a PhD in Spanish from the University of Texas at Austin.

~~**READING EXCERPT 1 (25 MIN.)**~~


**Introduction to the Novel**


                - Introduce students to _Letters from Heaven_ by Lydia Gil. This book is a work

of fiction, consisting of many chapters. Explain that, for the next two weeks,

students will be reading excerpts, or parts of the chapters, from the book.


                 - Explain that, throughout the unit, students will have the opportunity to write

narrative prose. They will take what they learn from Lydia Gil and use these

creative techniques in their own writing.


                  - Today, students will read the first excerpt, “ _Café con Leche_,” from Chapter 1

and pay attention to characterization in the novel.


                 - Explain to students that characterization is a description of someone’s

features, including their thoughts and feelings, personality, perspective, and

physical attributes. Tell students that authors sometimes use characterization

in their writing to help readers develop a deeper understanding of people in a

text.


                        - Remind students of the text they read in the Personal Narratives unit,

_The Year I Got Polio_ . Tell students that, in this text, the author uses

characterization when she describes herself as stronger than ever when

she’s healthy enough to go back to school.


1. **Evaluative.** What example(s) of characterization have you encountered in a

text that you have read?


» Answers may vary but should include examples of an author describing

someone’s features, thoughts, feelings, personality or perspective


**TEKS 4.6.D** Create mental images to deepen understanding; **TEKS 4.6.F** Make inferences and use evidence to support
understanding; **TEKS 4.7.A** Describe personal connections to a variety of sources, including self-selected texts;
**TEKS 4.7.C** Use text evidence to support an appropriate response; **TEKS 4.7.E** Interact with sources in meaningful
ways such as notetaking, annotating, freewriting, or illustrating; **TEKS 4.10.F** Discuss how the author’s use of language
contributes to voice.


Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**10**


2. **Evaluative.** Why is characterization important?


» Answers may vary, but should include that characterization helps the reader to

understand characters, including their mood, how they look, their motivations, the

choices they make, and how they relate to other people in the story.


**Note:** Looking at characterization also provides a great opportunity to

strengthen reading abilities. Good readers look for as many details as

possible and then use those details to discover ideas and meaning in the

text. Explain that, if characterization is done well, readers feel as if they know

the characters personally and can make accurate predictions about how

those characters will respond in certain situations. Tell students that as they

continue through the unit, they will have an opportunity to learn more about

the main characters.


**Reading: Excerpt 1**


 - Explain that often, when we read books, we imagine what characters look like

and how they act. This is an effective reading strategy. Today, as they read,

students should try to picture Celeste in their minds based on the information

in the text. Explain that this process is called _visualization_, and that students

will be practicing it in more detail.


 - Direct students to the excerpt “ _Café con Leche_ .”


 - Read the first paragraph aloud.


 - Instruct students to continue reading the excerpt silently on their own.


 - When students have read the story once, ask them to read it again, this time

looking carefully for details in the text.


 - When students have finished reading the story a second time, ask them to

close their eyes for five seconds to picture in their minds Celeste’s mood,

personality, and/or an interaction she had with a character in the story.

Encourage students to use the details in the text to help create the images in

their mind.


**Teacher Note:** Consider sharing passages from other texts students have

read in previous units or class materials that emphasize descriptive details,

asking students to practice creating mental images using textual evidence.



Challenge


Have students that finish
early write down details
they have learned about
Celeste, including those
used in creating their
mental images.

~~**ELPS 3.F**~~



Check for Understanding


Have students turn to a neighbor and share a personality trait they
inferred about Celeste


- Have students open their Activity Books to Activity Page 1.1. Have students

read the prompt and respond to it.


**Note:** As seen with Activity Page 1.1 below, this unit reproduces some content

from the student Activity Book. When appropriate, it also includes answers to

questions contained on those pages.


**Activity Page 1.1**


Describing Celeste


Write a short 3-5 sentence paragraph describing Celeste. Use specific details

in your descriptions. Remember that your goal is to help your reader imagine

Celeste in a way that matches what you have read in _Letters from Heaven._


**Teacher Note:** Responses will vary but may include details that describe

Celeste feeling distracted, tired, moving slowly, sad about losing her

grandmother, or confused about her new after school routine.


~~**ANNOTATING CHARACTER INTERACTIONS (30 MIN.)**~~


**Find Details in the Description of a Character**


- Review the process of visualization and give students time to picture Celeste

as they did earlier.


- Remind students when visualizing to look at the details in the text to help

create an image of the character in their minds. In addition, explain that

readers can learn about a character’s mood and personality by looking at the

words Gil uses in the excerpt.


- Ask students to reread the first paragraph, in which Celeste recalls her day.


1. **Literal.** What makes it seem like the “day feels like it’s never going to

end”?


» Celeste is distracted by thoughts of her grandmother. She imagines her

grandmother in her favorite green dress.



Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**12**


- Read the following from Excerpt 1:


“I run outside even though I’m not sure if anyone will be out there waiting

for me. I stand at the corner looking in all directions, waiting to see who’s

going to pick me up today. Yesterday it was Doña Esperanza, our next-door

neighbor. On Tuesday it was Lisa, my mom’s friend “


2. **Inferential.** Why might different people be picking Celeste up each day?


» Answers may vary, but students may infer that daily life has changed for

Celeste. Perhaps, Celeste’s grandmother used to pick her up and now that she

is gone different people are filling that role.


- Read the following from Excerpt 1:


“Like your grandma Rosa always said, may she rest in peace, ‘full belly:

happy heart.’”


“I keep walking as if I can’t hear what she is saying. I want to talk to her, but

nothing comes out.


When we get in the car, Doña Esperanza takes my hand and says: “I really

miss her too . . .”


3. **Evaluative.** What may be a reason that “nothing comes out” when

Celeste wants to talk?


» Answers may vary, but after reading the exchange, students might infer that it is

difficult for Celeste to talk about her grandmother, she may be too emotional to

speak, because they were very close.


- Ask students to share words and phrases that they can use to describe

Celeste. Record this list on the board or on chart paper. These can come from

their work on Activity Page 1.1 as well as from their more recent examination of

the text. Have students say which of the story’s details they used to make their

inferences.


- Have students add ideas from the list to Activity Page 1.1.


- Ask students to visualize an interaction between Celeste and another

character from the text. For example, the interaction Celeste has with Doña

Esperanza when Celeste is picked up from school or with her grandmother

when Celeste is being taught how to make _café con leche._


- Have students open their Activity Books to Activity Page 1.2. Ask them to use

colored pencils, markers, or crayons to draw the interaction they visualized.

Remind students that the author does not describe everything about the

characters, but the inferences and visualization should be supported by

details from the text.



Support


Review that an inference
is a conclusion or opinion
based on evidence, but
inferences are not stated
directly in text. Point
out that nowhere in the
text does it actually say
that Celeste might feel
distracted, but students
can infer this by reading
the text carefully. For
example, “Math, Science,
English, Social Studies,
it all blurs together in
my head and the only
thing I can think of is
my grandmother’s
green dress.”


Activity Page 1.2



Lesson 1 Describing Characters
**13**


                 - Also explain that details in the text provide evidence for some aspects of

what the character may be feeling or thinking, their mood or their personality

and that these details are especially important in helping to characterize the

person.


                 - Introduce the idea of _annotation_ . Explain that when people annotate, they add

notes to a text or drawing to explain it or comment on it. Add that, in this case,

students should annotate their drawings by writing direct quotes from the text

to show the details they used to make their drawings. Discuss the differences

between direct quotes and students’ own words.


                 - Ask some students to show their drawings. If possible, project these so the

entire class can see them easily.


Check for Understanding


Have students look at their lists of words and phrases that describe
Celeste. Ask them to choose a word or phrase that describes Celeste,
based on textual evidence (for example, Celeste loved her grandmother’s
cooking) and identify the detail in the text that tells them that this word
or phrase describes the character _. (“But I always licked the plate clean. . . ._
_my grandma’s cooking, no matter what she made, was always the best in_
_the world. At least for me.”)_


**Activity Page 1.2**


Drawing an Interaction


Draw a picture of Celeste and another character from the text interacting

together. Then annotate, using information from the text to show why you

drew Celeste and the second character the way you did. If you are using words

and phrases that appear in the text, enclose them in quotation marks.


1. Draw your picture here.

Pictures will vary, but should be supported by details in the text. Not all parts of the
drawing may be explicitly described in the text, but students should be able to point
to evidence in the text that supported their inferences and visualization.


2. Write your annotations here.

Answers will vary, but students should have sufficient quoted text evidence in their
annotations to support how they came up with their illustrations. Sample quote that
could be annotated: “My grandmother’s cooking, no matter what she made, was
always the best in the world.”

Page 1.2 and what the pictures show about the characterization of Celeste

and/or the other character. Students should also read their annotations aloud

to provide supporting details for their ideas.


 - Have students make personal connections to their work by asking each other

if they know anyone who is similar to one of the characters from the story. If

they do, have them explain the similarities.


 - Encourage students to ask each other questions about their work, such as

“Which details in the text made you think that Celeste was __________?” or

“Why did you draw the grandmother doing __________?”


 - Encourage students to add to their work based on the discussion with their

partner.


 - Invite students to share their drawings by projecting them or holding them up

in front of the class.


 - Ask students to identify the activity the drawing depicts. Then ask them to

offer something they like about the drawing or the annotation.


 - You may wish to model class responses by pointing to something students

have accurately depicted in the text.


 - Ask students to compare and contrast the drawings of the same character by

the two pairs.

_She likes to ______._


Intermediate
Ask questions to support
student writing, such as
_What does Celeste like to_
_do?_ or _What does Celeste_
_make with her grandma?_


Advanced/Advanced High

Provide light prompting
as needed and work
with students to expand
on details using their
understanding of syntax
and vocabulary.

~~**CREATING DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Instruct students that they will now practice writing. This is their chance to

practice what they have learned about detailed descriptions of a character.

They are going to write a description of Celeste based on information in the

text and inferences they can make using the text.


 - Remind students to use clues from the text to infer details about Celeste’s

personality.


 - Model an example to show the importance of using thoughtful word choice

when writing.


    - Write “I cross the street.” on the board.


    - Ask the students to imagine Celeste crossing the street on her way to

meet Doña Esperanza.


    - Now ask students to listen to the following from Excerpt 1: “I’m coming,”

I say, but I cross the street slowly, as if my feet ached.


    - Ask students which sentence puts a clearer picture in their head. Explain

that thoughtful word choice is one way authors include descriptive details

about a character.


 - Introduce the concept of _voice_ . Explain that this term refers to the mixture of

attitude, word choice, and point of view in a particular piece of writing. Explain

that authors often have a distinctive voice that helps identify their works as

their own. Explain too that authors choose specific words and an attitude or

feeling for each character they write, giving each character a distinct voice.


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.10.A** Explain the author’s purpose and message within
a text; **TEKS 4.10.F** Discuss how the author’s use of language contributes to voice; **TEKS 4.11.B.ii** Develop drafts into a

- Provide examples of voice. In the text, Celeste says “I always licked the plate

clean. Because my grandma’s cooking, no matter what she made, was always

the best in the world. At least for me it was.” to describe her grandmother’s

food. Explain to students that these words show Celeste’s enthusiasm.

Point out that this is an example of voice, because the author chose words

that elicit a specific feeling or attitude. This helps the reader to understand

the character’s personality. Direct students to the following excerpt from

Excerpt 1.


“If your face isn’t turning green, then you need to eat some more

vegetables!” she’d add.


But I always licked the plate clean. Because my grandma’s cooking, no

matter what she made, was always the best in the world. At least for me

it was.


1. How does Celeste’s memory of her Grandmother help illustrate the

characters’ personalities and their relationship?


Students may note that the grandmother seems playful and that

Celeste’s response is kind and shows respect.


- Have students open their Activity Book to Activity page 1.3


- Encourage students to think about their own writing voice as they complete

the assignment. Students are expected to write legibly in cursive to complete

assignments.


- Allow 15 minutes for writing, then transition to partner feedback.


**Activity Page 1.3**


Writing a Description


Excerpt 1 from _Letters from Heaven_ introduces the character Celeste. After

reading, write a paragraph describing this character’s mood, interests, and

the way she acts toward other people. Some of this information appears

directly in the text, but you may have to make inferences about other parts of

Celeste’s personality. Focus on details from the text and word choice that the

author uses when writing about the character. Remember that authors choose

specific words and an attitude or feeling for each character they write, giving

each character a distinct voice.



Activity Page 1.3


Support


When students are adding
details, help them with
examples of adjectives and
other phrases to make the
description more specific.
For example, if they have
written “Celeste seems
confused,” they could write,
“Celeste seems confused,
because she doesn’t know
who is picking her up from
school.”


Challenge


Have students write their
paragraphs; then have
them rewrite a sentence or
two from their work using
a different voice. Ask them
to describe the voices they
used and explain how those
voices are different.

Check for Understanding


Circulate and ensure that students are writing. If needed, offer prompts to
help them get started.


~~**PARTNER FEEDBACK (5 MIN.)**~~


                 - After students write their descriptions, have them share their writing with a

partner.


                 - Encourage students to identify one part of their partner’s description that they

thought was especially vivid or accurate, and have them explain why they think

so. Then have students identify one part of their partner’s description that can

be improved with more details.


                 - Direct students to return to their paragraphs and underline areas to be revised

based on their partner’s feedback. If their partner did not have constructive

feedback, encourage the student to identify a place to add a descriptive detail

or improve word choice.

~~**REVISING DESCRIPTIONS (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Inform students that today they will start by revising their descriptions from

yesterday.


 - Ask students why revision is an important part of every writer’s process.


    - Explain that all authors make improvements through revisions such as

adding descriptive details, changing the text’s order, or replacing a word

with a better choice. Remind students that in Unit 1 they strengthened

their own writing by revising their work.


    - Explain that adding, moving and removing text are important revision

strategies that authors use to make their message clearer for the reader.


    - Tell students that they will be providing feedback on each other’s work to

help with their revisions, but that not all students will include the same

quotes or details from the text. Everyone’s descriptions will be different

and therefore may include different supporting evidence.


 - Ask students to sit with the same partner from the previous lesson and open

their Activity Books to the descriptions and drawings they created on Activity

Pages 1.2 and 1.3.

Revising Your Description


Excerpt 1: “ _Café con Leche_ ”


Refer back to Activity Pages 1.2 and 1.3 and Excerpt 1: “ _Café con Leche_ .” You

and your partner will provide feedback on each other’s descriptions on Activity

Page 1.3 to make them better. Have your partner look at your drawing of

Celeste interacting with another character on Activity Page 1.2. Then read your

description of Celeste on Activity Page 1.3 to your partner. Ask your partner

the following questions and listen carefully to their answers. Write your

partner’s answers below to the questions.


1. Was there anything in my description that was confusing or that you weren’t

sure of?


2. What could have made my description clearer? Are there any details from

the text I can add to improve my description?


   - Sample Response: I am not sure what you mean by “Celeste is kind” in

your description. I think you should add the detail that Celeste makes _café_

_con leche_ for her grandmother and brings it to her when she is sick. Adding

this detail from the text would make your description of Celeste clearer.


Now go back to your writing and revise your work based on your partner’s

feedback.


You may wish to add words or sentences to the bottom, or cross out words or

sentences to replace them.


 - Direct students back to Activity Page 1.3 to revise their work. Students are

expected to write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.


 - As students work, circulate and help them choose details that could be clearer

or more specific.


 - Point out that there is space on the back of the Activity Book for exploring

creative writing. Once they have finished, students can create new

descriptions of a different character here or continue their revisions.

~~**INFERRING CHARACTER FEELINGS (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain to students that now that they have revised their character

descriptions, they are going to continue to make inferences about characters

in the text. Review the skills that students applied in lesson 1 by asking the

questions below:


1. **Evaluative.** How does visualizing and describing characters help readers

understand the text?


» Answers may vary but should include that visualizing and describing characters

helps readers to more deeply understand characters including their mood, how

they look, their motivations, the choices they make, and how they relate to other

people in the story.


 - Congratulate students on accomplishing an important reading task: observing

the details.


2. **Literal.** What is an inference?


» A conclusion or an opinion not stated in the text, based on evidence.


 - Direct students to Activity Page 2.2. This activity asks students to make

inferences about the character’s feelings, supported by evidence from the text

in Excerpt 1.


 - Ask students to complete the exercise in their Activity Books. Remind them

that they should be looking for a quote or quotes in the text to justify their

answers.


**Note:** The following content is from Activity Page 2.2 and contains suggested

answers.


**Activity Page 2.2**


Celeste’s Feelings


Excerpt 1: “ _Café con Leche_ ”


_Read and answer the questions below about Celeste’s feelings in Excerpt 1. Use_

_evidence from the text to support your responses. You may use one or more_

_quotes from Excerpt 1 to justify how Celeste feels about something and why._


1. How does Celeste feel about her relationship with her grandmother?


» Answers will vary. Sample responses could be: _She had a close relationship with_

_her grandmother and misses her now_ or _Celeste shared a special bond with her_

_grandmother._ Possible quotes: “I imagine that when I get there my after-school

snack will be waiting on the kitchen table. Grandma always had a warm cup of



Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**26**


_café con leche_ and toast for me. But when she got sick, I had to learn to prepare it

myself.”


2. How does Celeste feel about her grandmother’s cooking?


» Answers will vary. Sample responses could include that Celeste was _excited about,_

_impressed by, or loved her grandmother’s cooking_ . Possible quote: “Because my

grandma’s cooking, no matter what she made, was always the best in the world.”


3. How does Celeste feel about the _café con leche_ that she makes for her

grandmother?


» Answers will vary. Sample word could be _proud_ ; possible quotes: “This coffee is

ready to be entered in a contest.”; “Now, this cup takes first place!”


Check for Understanding


After students answer the first question, take a class poll to see which
words or phrases students chose for Celeste’s relationship with her
grandmother. Answers will vary but may include they were close, shared a
special bond, or her grandmother took care of her. Encourage students to
use textual evidence to support their answers.


 - You can work as a class question by question, or have students work

independently or with a partner.


 - After students answer all three questions, go through the answers and ask

students to share the quotes they provided as evidence.



Challenge


Have students think of
multiple words to describe
Celeste’s feelings in each
situation.


Support


Provide students with
the following word bank
to choose from for their
responses: _excited,_
_ashamed, proud, happy,_
_unhappy, disappointed,_
_bored, sad._ Provide
students with the sentence

~~**LOOKING FOR THEME IN EXCERPT 1 (15 MIN.)**~~



55M



**Note:** In this exercise students will build on their inferences from the previous

exercise about the character’s feelings and trace patterns and big ideas that

arise. Noticing patterns in how the characters feel, act, and respond will help

them to discover a theme. Potential themes students may uncover are those

of loss or hopefulness. Remind students that in order to discover patterns and

themes, they will need to make inferences in addition to considering what is

described directly in the text.


1. **Evaluative.** What are some of the habits of good readers we have learned so far?


» Answers will vary, but they may include that good readers look for details in the

text to make observations and build meaning. This includes using descriptions of

characters to make inferences about them.


                 - Introduce the literary term _theme_ : a universal idea in the text.


                 - Explain that a theme is a big idea that comes up repeatedly in a text. A theme

touches on ideas that connect all people, such as loneliness, friendship, and

bravery.


                 - Explain that today students will learn how to look for a theme in the text.


2. **Evaluative.** How is a theme like a pattern?


» Explanations will vary, but they may include that patterns repeat, as do themes.


                 - Repetitions and patterns in a story indicate a theme.


                 - Have students review Excerpt 1, “ _Café con Leche._ ” Review student’s ideas

about how Celeste feels about her grandmother and the details in the text that

supported their responses.


**TEKS 4.8.A** Infer basic themes supported by text evidence; **TEKS 4.6.C** Make and correct or confirm predictions using text
features, characteristics of genre, and structures; **TEKS 4.6.G** Evaluate details read to determine key ideas; **TEKS 4.6.H**

Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**28**


- Ask students to identify a pattern in the excerpt regarding how Celeste acts

and feels when she thinks about her grandmother. Ask students how they

might characterize her emotions. Have students discuss why Celeste may

have these emotions based on the text. Ask students what word(s) they could

use to describe this theme.


- Ask students whether they see any other theme in this excerpt. Review that a

theme is a mean idea that connects to common human experiences. It may

repeat like a pattern in a text.


   - Student answers will vary but may include observations that Celeste is

undergoing many changes in her life and relationships or that Celeste

remains very appreciative of her grandmother’s cooking, care, and their

bond. These may turn into themes later in the book. However, if students

do not pick up on specific themes at this point in their reading, encourage

them to identify some patterns in the text.


- Encourage students to consider patterns that help them to determine themes

as they read further.


- Have students complete Activity Page 2.3, which asks them to draw a picture and

write a caption describing patterns they notice involving the main character Celeste.


**Activity Page 2.3**


Patterns in the Excerpt


_Think about the patterns or big ideas you noticed in Excerpt 1, “_ Café con

Leche _.” Draw a picture of the main character, Celeste, as she moves through the_

_day that is described in the excerpt. Illustrate any patterns or big ideas that you_

_notice in the excerpt. Then write a caption to describe the patterns or big ideas_

_you have drawn. Share your work with a partner._


» Answers will vary but may include illustrations and captions that demonstrate

that Celeste thinks about her grandmother throughout the day, such as when she

is picked up, on her way home, and when she arrives home from school.


~~**READING EXCERPT 2 (20 MIN.)**~~


- Direct students to turn to the next excerpt, “ _Cangrejitos de Guayaba y Queso._ ”


- Remind students to look for what is revealed about characters in this excerpt,

as they think about patterns, or big ideas that are repeating.


- Read the first two paragraphs aloud.

text details support that
prediction?



Lesson 2 Discovering a Theme
**29**


Activity Page 2.4



**Evaluative.** What can you learn about the character, Celeste, from these two

paragraphs, and why?


» Possible responses: She is obedient because she doesn’t open the door until the

mail carrier has moved on; she is curious because she wants to know what is in

the box.


**Inferential.** Predict what might be in the package and who might have sent it

to Celeste. Use details from the text to support your prediction.


» Responses will vary but should be supported by details from the text.


- Ask students to continue reading the rest of the excerpt independently and in

silence.


- After students have read the remainder of the excerpt, ask them to carry out

the activity on Activity Page 2.4. This activity will help them with their reading

and help them think further about the question of theme. Point out that the

pattern they identified in Excerpt 1 may still appear in Excerpt 2, or a new

theme or pattern may emerge.


**Activity Page 2.4**


Theme in “ _Cangrejitos de Guayaba y Queso_ ”


_Use your practice looking for patterns or repeating big ideas to think about_

_a theme described in Excerpt 2, “_ Cangrejitos de Guayaba y Queso _.”_ _Draw_

_a picture of Celeste after she opens the package and reads the letter from_

_her grandmother. Then write what you think the theme is at this point in the_

_narrative. Share your work with a partner._


- Responses will vary. Possible response: The theme is one of hope. The

words in the letter are one example of hope. For instance, the letter from her

grandmother says, “While I may no longer be there with you, there’s a way you

can feel that we’re still together.” Another example of hope is the opportunity

for the traditional Cuban food Celeste loves that her grandmother used to

make, to return to Celeste’s life now that she has the recipes. At the end,

Celeste is excited to receive the note and the ingredients for the dish, and she

is smiling because she has hope that there may still be a way to connect with

her grandmother.

- Have students share their ideas about the theme or themes described in

this excerpt. Remind them to justify their ideas using information from and

inferences they made about the text.


- Based on student responses, guide them to understand that themes can

appear continuously throughout a text, but new ones can emerge as well. For

example, while Celeste may still be feeling a sense of sadness about the loss

of her grandmother, she may feel hopeful now about being able to remember,

and feel connected with, her grandmother through cooking.


   - Emphasize other lines from the letter such as “I promise you that the

first bite will take you back to when we were together!” and “While I may

no longer be there with you, there’s a way you can feel that we’re still

together.”


~~**COMPARING THEME IN EXCERPT 1 AND EXCERPT 2 (20 MIN.)**~~


- Remind students that the two excerpts, “ _Café con Leche_ ” and “ _Cangrejitos_

_de Guayaba y Queso,_ ” come from the same story, but point out that different

themes may emerge.


- Have students discuss with a partner how the two excerpts are alike and how

they are different.


   - Emphasize how the character of Celeste varies from Excerpt 1 to

Excerpt 2.


   - Remind students that characters’ actions and responses can often help us

identify themes.


   - How would you describe Celeste’s actions and responses in Excerpt 1?

How would you describe Celeste’s actions and responses in Excerpt 2?


- Have students open their Activity Books to Activity Page 2.5, “Compare and

Contrast Excerpts 1 and 2.” Students should use information and inferences

from these discussions, along with the pictures they drew on earlier Activity

Pages, to help them complete the assignment.

 - How the character’s actions and responses are related to patterns, or big

ideas in the excerpt


 - Explain at least one theme that exists in each excerpt and why you think so

using evidence from the text


Student answers on theme may vary, but possible responses may include:


What Happens



Excerpt 1


Celeste is picked up from school and

comes home. She’s thinking a lot

about her grandmother, who died

recently.



Excerpt 2


Celeste receives a package and a

letter that turn out to be from her

grandmother. The package contains

ingredients for making a special dish,

_cangrejitos de guayaba y queso._



Excerpt 1



Celeste’s Action or Responses


Excerpt 2



Celeste misses her Grandma and has

trouble thinking of anything but her.

She recalls fond memories of her

grandmother, such as her favorite

color, her cooking, and their shared

experiences with cafe con leche.



The note reminds Celeste of her

Grandma and makes her feel cared

for. She remembers Grandma’s story

about how Cuban people left notes

to make their loved ones feel cared

for, and she felt like this was what

Grandma was doing with her letters.



Excerpt 1


The main theme is one of loss.



Theme


Excerpt 2


The main theme is one of

hopefulness.

- Wrap up by having students share their thoughts. Guide students to see the

differences in character actions and theme, in particular, between the two

excerpts.


- Have students make predictions about what will come next in the story. Have

students discuss identified themes, and ask them whether they think the

theme of loss, the theme of hopefulness, or a different theme will continue

throughout the story. Have students explain their reasoning using textual

evidence.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to describe the changes between Excerpt 1 and Excerpt 2
regarding character actions and theme. Students should support their
identified themes with details from the text. Elicit a possible theme that,
after receiving and opening the package, Celeste is feeling more hopeful
and better connected to her grandmother.

Point out that the line of
dialogue beginning with _No,_
_Mami_ is broken into two
parts by the words
_I tell her_ . Show students
that _I tell her_ is not a part
of the dialogue but that the
parts of the sentence that
appear on both sides of
_I tell her_ are things that the
character of Celeste says.


Challenge


Point out that the second
line of dialogue does not
have a phrase such as _I_
_say_ or _she tells me_ that
explains who is speaking.
Ask students how they
can tell who the speaker
is. Note that there may
be multiple responses to
this question.




 - Inform students that they will be moving on to the third chapter of _Letters_

_from Heaven._ Tell them that this excerpt will give more information about

a character who is important to the story—the character of Mami, who is

Celeste’s mother.


 - Explain that there are other characters who appear in this excerpt as well, but

the focus of the instruction will be on the character of Mami.


 - Inform students that this excerpt involves dialogue.


 - Explain that _dialogue_ is words or sentences spoken by characters to one

another in a poem, play, or story. Ask students to name a story or novel they

have read that includes dialogue. Have them tell the name of a character who

speaks the dialogue and, if possible, something that one of the characters says.


 - Explain that in texts, dialogue is usually written in quotation marks. Show

students one example of quotation marks used as punctuation in dialogue

in the excerpt. Tell them that they will be identifying dialogue as they read by

noticing the phrases or sentences that use quotation marks.


 - Tell students that stories with plenty of dialogue can easily be converted into

_scenes,_ or units of division of an act, which are parts of a play. Explain that

students will turn part of this excerpt into a play and that each student will

have a chance to play a part as an actor or serve as the scene’s director.


 - Explain that before students rehearse their scenes, the class needs to identify

the dialogue in the text.


1. **Literal.** What punctuation mark will help you to identify dialogue while

reading?


» quotation marks


**TEKS 4.8.C** Analyze plot elements, including the rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution; **TEKS 4.1.D** Work

- Direct students to Activity Page 3.1. Have them read the directions. Tell

students that they will work on this page individually before meeting in small

groups to rehearse, or practice, the scene.


**Note:** The following content is from Activity Page 3.1.


**Activity Page 3.1**


Dialogue and Action in Excerpt 3


- Follow the instructions.


1. **Literal.** Who are the characters in the scene that makes up the first part

of Excerpt 3?


» Celeste and her mother, Mami


2. **Evaluative.** Underline the dialogue in the paragraphs below.


Mami gets home from the factory exhausted, like always. She opens the

door, throws her bag on the floor, takes off her shoes and falls onto the

couch.


“Mami, Mami! Close your eyes!” I say eagerly.


“Ay, _cielo_ . I’m so tired that if I close my eyes I’ll fall asleep right here.”


“No, Mami, close your eyes for a second,” I tell her, “and smell.”


I watch her close her eyes and her lips slowly curl up into a little smile.


“Something smells wonderful,” she says.


“Don’t open your eyes just yet,” I say, running to get the tray of _cangrejitos_ .


“Now,” I tell her.


When she sees them, the smile is erased from her face and she begins to

cry. I start to cry too. I place the tray on the table so that the _cangrejitos_

don’t get wet with tears and I hug her. We stay like that for a while until we

catch the scent of the _cangrejitos_ again and we devour them in silence.


3. **Evaluative.** Now highlight the actions in the scene—something that is

done, such as any movement or activity, by the characters.

Check for Understanding


Choose a student and ask what they underlined as the first line of
dialogue. Then poll the class to agree or disagree. Ask another student to
name the last action, and poll for agreement or disagreement. Clarify any
misconceptions about dialogue and action before moving forward.


~~**ACTING OUT THE SCENE (20 MIN.)**~~


- Arrange students in groups of three. Designate one student to be the

director, and assign the roles of Celeste and Mami to the other two students.

Alternatively, you can allow students to choose their assignments themselves.


- Instruct students that they will now rehearse the scene they have been

working on. Help them understand that _rehearse_ means to practice. Remind

them to say lines exactly as they appear in the text and to act out all of the

actions. Encourage them to read their dialogue with expression and to think

about how each character feels as they carry out the action or speak the

dialogue.


- Direct students to instructions on Activity Page 3.2. If you wish, go over the

responsibilities of the actors and director before students rehearse. Tell

students that they will participate as audience members later in the lesson.


- Allow students 10 minutes to work on their scenes and practice. Circulate and

check in with students; if some say they have finished early, encourage them

to perform the dialogue and actions in a way that conveys how the character is

feeling and their motivations. .


**Note:** The following content is from Activity Page 3.2.

**Acting and Directing**


_In your group of three, one of you will be the director, and the other two will_

_play Celeste and her mother in the first scene of Excerpt 3 from Letters from_

_Heaven._


_The director’s job is to make sure the scene accurately shows what the_

_characters say, do and how they feel. To do that, the director has to concentrate_



Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**40**


_on the text, listen to the actors, and give them feedback. The actors have to_

_make the audience believe they are the mother and Celeste and accurately_

_convey their feelings._


_Read and think about the following questions to prepare for your role._


1. As Celeste, think about:


  - How would your character show that she is eager to talk to Mami?


  - Why does your character begin to cry when Mami cries?


  - Why does your character want her mother to close her eyes before your

character brings out the tray of _cangrejitos_ ?


2. As Mami, think about:


  - How is your character feeling when she arrives home? Why?


  - Why does your character curve her lips into a smile?


  - How does your character’s feelings change as the scene continues?


3. As the director, think about:


  - Are the characters standing or sitting? Where are they looking?


  - How do they emphasize their words?


  - How does what one character says impact the other character?


4. When listening as an audience, think about:


  - How did the actors show the emotions of the characters?


  - Did what they say and do match the text?


  - Look at the actors’ facial expressions. How do they change throughout the

scene?


Check for Understanding


While students are rehearsing, circulate and make sure each student
is following their assigned role and responsibility. Use the questions on
Activity Page 3.2 to keep students on task, if necessary.


Lesson 3 Investigating Characters

Support


You may wish to reinforce
the idea of action words by
writing action words on the
board and having students
complete the actions. Use
words from the text like
_throw, fall,_ and _devour_ as
well as other verbs such as
_point_, _jump_, and _hurry_ .



Perform Scenes


- Ask for volunteers to perform their scenes. Decide how many scenes you will

look at, depending on time and the interest of your students.


- Direct students to the “When listening as an audience…” notes on Activity

Page 3.2 before they watch each performance. Review the questions that

audience members ask themselves with the class before the first scene is

performed. After each performance, ask for volunteers to answer one of the

questions provided for audience members.


- Ask students what emotions Celeste and her mother seemed to show at the

beginning of the scene and at the end of the scene. Congratulate the actors

and director on performing and focusing on how to portray the characters.


- Transition to writing by informing students they will now use their insights into

the characters and this scene to write about it.

###### Reading 20M


**Primary Focus:** Students will draw on details from the text to analyze the character

of Mami, including her dialogue, actions, and motivation. ~~**[TEKS 4.6.F; TEKS 4.8.B ]**~~


~~**CHARACTER INVESTIGATION (20 MIN.)**~~


Facilitate a discussion to introduce character investigation.


 - Tell students that their performances have helped them to more deeply

understand how the characters feel, which they will continue to examine in the

text. Explain that just like people, characters’ feelings often change throughout

a text and that Mami experiences several different feelings during the course

of the scene in Excerpt 3.


 - Have students reread Excerpt 3.


1. **Literal.** What words and phrases in the dialogue or actions indicate Mami’s

moods?


» Answers will vary. Possible responses include _exhausted, happiness, sadness, falls_

_onto the couch, “I’m so tired,” her lips slowly curl up into a little smile, “something_

_smells wonderful,”_ and _she begins to cry, the smile is erased from her face._


 - Direct students to the three-column chart you prepared in advance. Point to

and read each header—beginning, middle, and end—aloud. Have students

brainstorm Mami’s feelings for each part of this excerpt, and share their

evidence from the text. Responses will vary, but ensure they can be supported

by dialogue or actions from the excerpt, in chronological order. (Sample

response: She is tired when she first comes home, happy when she smells the

_cangrejitos_, and sad when she starts thinking about Celeste’s grandmother.)


 - **Think, Pair, Share** : Ask students to discuss, with a partner, the differences

between Mami’s moods, using evidence from the text. Encourage students to

compare and contrast Mami’s feelings at the beginning of the scene and her

feelings at the end of the scene by answering the following questions:


2. **Inferential.** What inferences can you make about Mami’s moods when

reading the excerpt?


» Answers will vary.


**TEKS 4.6.F** Make inferences and use evidence to support understanding; **TEKS 4.8.B** Explain the interactions of the
characters and the changes they undergo


Lesson 3 Investigating Characters
**43**


Challenge


Have students compare
Mami’s feelings in
the excerpt to those
of Celeste’s. Have
students explain how the
interactions between the
two characters impact
their emotions.



3. **Inferential.** Explain how Mami’s mood changes throughout the scene. What

do you think causes her mood to change?


» Answers will vary. Students may recognize that Mami is exhausted at the

beginning of the scene and happy when smelling the food. Students may also

notice that even though Mami is sad at the end of the scene, she and Celeste

are hugging each other and sharing their feelings of sadness about Celeste’s

grandmother.


4. **Evaluative.** Do you think it’s possible for characters to have multiple

feelings at the same time? Why or why not?


» Answers will vary. Based on student responses, you can elevate the idea that

characters, just like us, can feel different emotions at the same time. For example,

in the excerpt Mami smiles when she smells the familiar scent of the _cangrejitos_,

showing her happiness, but starts to cry when she sees them, showing the reader

that seeing these brings up the memory of her mother which makes her feel

sadness as well.


 - Wrap up this part of the conversation by having volunteers describe their

investigation and analysis of the character, Mami, in this excerpt.


 - Have students open their Activity Books to Activity Page 3.3. Have students

read the directions independently.


 - Tell students that they will need to use Excerpt 3 to find important details

about Mami’s moods to record on Activity Page 3.3. Remind them that they

are only looking at the first scene in Excerpt 3, to describe Mami’s moods, not

the scene with Celeste’s friends Silvia and Karen at school that follows it.


 - Ask students to write in complete sentences. Review proper capitalization and

punctuation as needed.


   - Review use of quotation marks when taking material directly from the text.


   - Remind students that they may use details provided in character dialogue

or actions.


 - Tell students that they should include different moods, with supporting

evidence for each, if they think Mami’s moods change in the excerpt.


 - As needed, provide sentence frames such as _I know Mami is (tired) because_

____________ or _One detail that shows Mami’s mood when she smells the_

_cangrejitos is __________._


 - Once students have completed AB 3.3, have students share their work with

partners. Have students add to their work as needed, based on feedback.

                 - Assign partners for sharing students’ plans for writing a personal narrative.

These may be the same pairs as in other parts of this lesson but do not need

to be.


**Universal Access**


Reading


                - Provide prompts, questions, and sentence frames for students to discuss

dialogue and quotation marks.


                        - Who speaks the line of dialogue beginning __________? How do you know?


                        - Where do the quotation marks belong in this sentence? Why?


                        - What words did you have to change to put the line of dialogue in the voice

of the actual speaker? Why?


                - Guide students to use the Venn diagram on Activity Page 4.2 to help them

compare and contrast Lisa and Mami. Use questions and sentence frames as

needed.


                        - What do you put into the area where the circles come together?


                        - Lisa and Mami are both __________, but only Lisa __________.


                        - Mami is __________, but Lisa is not.


                        - Lisa and Mami are different because __________.


Writing


                - Review the differences between planning a personal narrative (or any other

piece of writing) and actually writing or drafting a personal narrative.


                        - Planning includes taking notes, which may be in bullet form, in complete

sentences, or in a graphic organizer as in lesson 3.


                        - Writing or drafting involves complete sentences, transitions, and more

formal connections between ideas.

**Lesson 4: Comparing and Contrasting Characters**
###### Reading 60M


**Primary Focus**

Students will determine where to place quotation marks to set apart dialogue in a

text. ~~**[ TEKS 4.11.D.x ]**~~

Students will compare and contrast two characters in Excerpt 4 from _Letters from_

_Heaven_ . ~~**[ TEKS 4.6.G; TEKS 4.6.H; TEKS 4.7.B ]**~~


~~**READING EXCERPT 4 (30 MIN.)**~~


**Reading the Excerpt**


                 - Inform students that today they will read a new excerpt, and continue to read,

citing and synthesizing details from the text to make inferences about Celeste.


                - Remind students that a theme is a big idea that comes up repeatedly in a

text. A theme touches on ideas that connect all people, such as loneliness,

friendship, and bravery. Ask students to share themes they remember from

analyzing Excerpt 2. Sample responses may include: sorrow, loss, or hope.


                 - Ask students to turn to the new excerpt, “ _Congrí._ ” Ask students to predict the

meaning of the word _congrí_, based on the focal points of the novel thus far

and the titles of the first two excerpts, “ _Café con Leche_ ” and “ _Cangrejitos de_

_Guayaba y Queso_ .” Elicit that just like these two excerpt titles, _congrí_ is likely to

be the name of a traditional Cuban food that the grandmother used to prepare

for Celeste and her mother.


                 - Read the first paragraph of Excerpt 4 aloud, using expression, especially when

you reach the exclamation mark.


1. **Inferential.** Who is telling the story in this excerpt?


» The narrator is Celeste.


2. **Literal.** Which character do we meet in person for the first time?


» Lisa appears in the story for the first time.


3. **Literal.** What does the narrator tell us about Lisa?


» Lisa doesn’t own a car, doesn’t use makeup


**TEKS 4.11.D.x** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including punctuation marks, including apostrophes in
possessives, commas in compound sentences, and quotation marks in dialogue; **TEKS 4.6.G** Evaluate details read to
determine key ideas; **TEKS 4.6.H** Synthesize information to create new understanding; **TEKS 4.7.B** Write responses that
demonstrate understanding of texts, including comparing and contrasting ideas across a variety of sources.


Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**54**


4. **Evaluative.** What is the narrator’s overall opinion of Lisa? How do you know?


» Answers will vary but students should include evidence from the text to support

their response.


 - Give students 15 minutes to read the rest of the excerpt silently.


 - Remind students that during the previous lessons, they investigated Celeste’s

and Mami’s feelings, and how their feelings were impacted by other people.

Explain that today, students will continue looking at the same ideas with a new

character, Lisa, in a new excerpt.


**Dialogue**


 - Point out that dialogue was important in the previous excerpts, and explain

that it remains important in this excerpt as well.


5. **Literal.** Who is speaking the line of dialogue “Hi, beautiful!”?


» Lisa


6. **Evaluative.** What can you infer from this line of dialogue about Lisa’s

attitude toward Celeste?


» Responses may vary, but could include that Lisa wants to make Celeste feel

good about herself.


7. **Literal.** What punctuation mark is used to indicate that someone is

speaking in a text?


» Quotation marks are used to show that someone is speaking.


 - Have students read aloud different lines of dialogue from the middle

paragraphs of the excerpts.


    - Point out that some of this dialogue is very short (“no” and “yeah”), while

other statements and questions are more complex (“Your mami told me

that you made some delicious _cangrejitos_ . . .”).


    - Encourage students to think carefully about the feelings and thoughts of the

speaker and say the dialogue in a manner that matches the feeling. Point

out that students can identify feelings and moods by using the length of the

dialogue, word choice, the punctuation the author provides (such as the

exclamation mark after “Hi, beautiful!”), and clues from elsewhere in the

narrative (such as Celeste admitting that she doesn’t feel like talking).


 - Call students’ attention to the first paragraph of the excerpt. Show the class

that there are no quotation marks in this paragraph. Explain that this is

because no one is actually speaking during this part of the story.


 - Point out, however, that the word _says_ appears three times in the paragraph.


Lesson 4 Comparing and Contrasting Characters
**55**


Support


Work with students to
see how these pronouns
change and why. Point out
that they would not say
“She doesn’t need a car”
when they are referring to
themselves. Use colored
markers to identify the
different pronouns in the
two sentences.



Tell students that this word appears because Celeste is remembering times

when one of the story’s characters was speaking.


- Direct students’ attention to the sentence “She says she doesn’t need one,

that with her own two feet she can walk or pedal to wherever she has to go.”

Point out that _she_ in this sentence refers to Lisa and _one_ refers to a car.


- Ask students to imagine that they are Lisa, and have volunteers say the words

that Lisa would say to get across the idea that Lisa does not think that she

needs a car. (“I don’t need a car. With my own two feet I can walk or pedal

to wherever I have to go.”) As before, have students say the dialogue with

appropriate expression.


- On the board, write the sentences _Lisa says, “I don’t need a car. With my own two_

_feet I can walk or pedal to wherever I have to go.”_ and _She says she doesn’t need_

_one, that with her own two feet she can walk or pedal to wherever she has to go._


- Have students compare the two sentences on the board.


   - Emphasize the role of the quotation marks in the first sentence, which begin

when the speaker begins to talk and close when she is finished speaking.


   - Point out that the pronouns in the second sentence _she_ and _her_ changed

to _I_ and _my_ in the first sentence with dialogue, because those are the

words Lisa would use when she is speaking rather than the words Celeste

would use when describing the situation.


   - Point out other differences between the sentences, including that the word

_one_ has been changed to _a car_, that _doesn’t_ has changed to _don’t_ to agree

with the subject _I_, and that the word _that_ is missing because Lisa would

not actually say this word in her sentence.


- Have students open their Activity Books to Activity Page 4.1. Read the

instructions aloud.


- Tell students that you will share a few examples that are not from the text before they

do Activity Page 4.1 independently. Ask students to give a thumbs up or thumbs down

to show whether or not quotation marks are needed. Read the following sentences

aloud to students, pausing to emphasize when quotation marks are needed.


   - The teacher told us that we should all do our homework. (Thumbs down)


   - Johnny said, “Let’s go get some ice cream.” (Thumbs up)


   - His mom said we could get ice cream after we did our homework.

(Thumbs down)


   - “You have to do your homework first,” said Mom. (Thumbs up)


**Note:** The following content is from Activity Page 4.1.



Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**56**


**Activity Page 4.1**


Dialogue and Quotation Marks


Reread the first paragraph of Excerpt 4 and locate the three uses of the word
_says_ in the text. In each of these sentences, Celeste is retelling in her own words
what Mami and Lisa are saying. Mami and Lisa are not actually speaking.


Suppose that Mami and Lisa were actually speaking. How would you write
what they say as dialogue?


The sentences with _says_ are written below. Rewrite each sentence as if
Mami and Lisa are actually speaking. Don’t forget to begin each sentence
with _Mami says_ or _Lisa says_, followed by a comma. Then write the dialogue,
enclosing the spoken words in quotation marks. You may need to change
pronouns to match what the speaker would say.


1. She says she doesn’t need one, that with her own two feet she can walk or

pedal to wherever she has to go.


» Answers will vary. Possible response: _Lisa says, “I don’t need a car. With my own_

_two feet I can walk or pedal to wherever I have to go.”_


2. She says that Lisa is like her sister, even though they don’t look anything

alike.


» Answers will vary. Possible response: _Mami says, “Lisa is like my sister, even_

_though we don’t look anything alike.”_


3. Mami says that Lisa doesn’t use makeup because she doesn’t need it.


» Answers will vary. Possible response: _Mami says, “Lisa doesn’t use makeup_

_because she doesn’t need it.”_


Check for Understanding


Have students identify where the dialogue they wrote begins and where
it ends. Ask them to explain to you how they knew where to place the
quotation marks.


 - When students have finished the assignment, have them form pairs and

take turns reading the dialogue, paying attention to the expression that the

character (Lisa or Mami) would likely use.

Lesson 4 Comparing and Contrasting Characters
**57**


Activity Page 4.2



~~**COMPARING AND CONTRASTING (30 MIN.)**~~


- Briefly review the excerpt. Then review the way Mami is described in previous

excerpts.


   - Ask students to share words and phrases that describe Mami based on

what they know about her so far in the text, and write their responses on the

board. Ensure that students’ responses can be supported by the excerpts.


- Point out that while Mami does not actually appear in this scene in Excerpt 4,

she is mentioned several times and that many of these references compare or

contrast her to Lisa.


- Tell students that they will be comparing and contrasting the characters Mami

and Lisa. Have students reread the excerpt to look for ways in which Lisa and

Mami are alike. Then have them reread to find ways in which the two characters

are different. If needed, review that finding similarities is often referred to as

comparing and that finding differences is often called contrasting.


- Explain that students will use a Venn diagram to help them compare and

contrast the characters of Mami and Lisa. Then explain that they will use this

information to write a short paragraph telling how the characters are alike and

how they are different.


- Tell students to open their Activity Books to Activity Page 4.2. Read the

directions aloud. Students who participated in the program in earlier grades

are familiar with using Venn Diagrams. You may wish to review the Venn

Diagram before students begin the activity. Remind students that Venn

diagrams are thinking tools that help us organize information.


   - Emphasize that each circle tells about one of the two characters.


   - The section in the middle includes information that is true about both

Mami and Lisa.


   - The other sections of the circle give information that is true about one

character but not about the other.


**Note:** The following content is from Activity Page 4.2.


**Activity Page 4.2**


Compare and Contrast Lisa and Mami


In the first four excerpts from _Letters from Heaven_, you have learned a lot
about the characters Lisa and Mami. You’ve learned about how they look,



Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**58**


and you’ve also learned about how they act. In this activity, you will compare
and contrast what you know about these two characters.


First, fill in the Venn diagram to tell how the characters are alike and how they
are different. You can use words and short phrases. On the left, write information
that applies only to Lisa. On the right, place information that applies only to
Mami. In the middle, write information that applies to both Lisa and Mami.


» Answers will vary. Possible response: _Lisa only: uses no makeup, dresses “strange.”_

_Mami only: wears makeup, dresses so her clothing matches. Both: Friends, like_

_Celeste, and look out for her._


Now, write a paragraph using the information in the Venn diagram. Explain
how Mami and Lisa are alike and how they are different. Use full sentences
with proper punctuation.


» Answers will vary. Possible response: _Mami and Lisa are very different in some_

_ways. Mami dresses well and always uses makeup, but Lisa doesn’t use makeup_

_and dresses in a way that Celeste thinks is a little bit strange. Celeste also says that_

_they don’t look anything alike, which is another difference. At the same time, they_

_are alike because they are very close friends and because they are both very fond of_

_Celeste and look out for her to make sure she is okay._


Check for Understanding


Ask students whether they think Lisa and Mami are more different or
more alike. Have them explain their thinking.


- When students have completed their paragraphs, have each trade with a

partner and read the partner’s work. Encourage them to discuss where they

agree with each other and where they disagree. Remind students that any

conclusion is permissible as long as it is supported by evidence.

**Lesson 4: Comparing and Contrasting Characters**
###### Writing 30M


**Primary Focus:** Students will plan to write a personal narrative involving a

relationship that is important to them.


~~**TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.11.A; TEKS 4.11.B.i; TEKS 4.12.A**~~


~~**PERSONAL NARRATIVE PLANNING (25 MIN.)**~~


**Personal Narratives**


                 - Remind students that a personal narrative is a piece of nonfiction writing told

in the first person by someone who was involved in the events being described.


                 - Personal narratives are true stories. Authors use their memory of the events to

include detailed descriptions of real events that happened.


**Teacher Note:** Emphasize for students that _Letters from Heaven_ is fiction
with the narrator, Celeste, telling the story from a first person point of view,
but their personal narratives will be nonfiction from their first person point
of view. Students should understand that fiction written from a first person
point of view is NOT the same as their nonfiction personal narrative writing.


                 - Students will use what they have learned about writing personal narratives

from their Unit 1 writing experience.


                 - Remind students that the basic structure of a personal narrative tells the

events in the order that they happened.


1. **Evaluative.** Why do you think many personal narratives are written in

chronological order?


» It is one way to make the story easier to follow and understand.


                - Review that a personal narrative should have a beginning, middle, and end.


                 - Explain that students will use their brainstorming from the last lesson to

continue to plan a personal narrative of their own.


                        - Emphasize for students that they will not actually write narratives during

this lesson but will focus instead on the prewriting step of the writing

process to plan their personal narratives.


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.11.A** Plan a first draft by selecting a genre for a
particular topic, purpose, and audience using a range of strategies such as brainstorming, freewriting, and mapping; **TEKS**

   - Tell students that they will plan their personal narratives about an

experience shared with another person who is special in their lives. This

is someone with whom they have a special relationship with and may be a

family member, a friend, a trusted adult, a classmate, and so on.


- You will use your ideas from Activity Page 3.5 to help you generate descriptive

details for this plan. Refer back to your brainstorming page to remind yourself

of the special person you selected and your relationship with them.


- Have students open their Activity Books to Activity Page 4.3. Point out that there

is a graphic organizer on this page. Explain that this organizer will help students

organize their thoughts about the special person that will be the subject of

their writing and the sequence of events in the experience they have shared.

Students are expected to write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Writing**


                 - Provide lined paper for writing additional pages of the personal narrative draft.


**Reading**


                - Keep the same partners from the previous lesson segment, or assign new

ones.


                - Create a simple two-column chart to show examples of sensory language.

The headers for the columns should be Sensory Language and Mental Image.

Alternatively, you may wish to create the chart on the board during the lesson.


                      - **Teacher Note:** This lesson refers to the idea of “family” repeatedly, due to the

content of the narrative. Students who may be sensitive to the term “family”

may need other language used, or other options provided. For example,

“family” can often be used as a broader term to reflect the relationships and

###### Speaking and Listening



20M



**Primary Focus:** Students will orally share a personal experience, using a graphic

organizer to detail their experience with sensory language.


~~**TEKS 4.6.E; TEKS 4.7.F; TEKS 4.10.G**~~


~~**SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCES (20 MIN.)**~~


                - Point out to students that some of Celeste’s most important experiences

have to do with a connection to family. For example, she bonded with her

grandmother over cooking (use the incident with the plantains and the

_mariquitas_ as an example of text evidence).


                 - Ask students to think briefly about the personal narrative they began planning

in a previous lesson. Remind them that the personal narrative involves a

special person who has been important in their lives.


                 - Allow student volunteers to share and explain one detail about the selected

relationship that makes it special to them.


                - Review that both Grandma and Doña Esperanza felt a connection when they

thought of their earlier lives on a Caribbean island. Explain that in this part of

the lesson, students will share a personal experience with a partner.


                - Review the meaning of an _anecdote_, a short narrative that describes an

interesting incident or event and explain that the personal experience they will

be writing will be an anecdote.


                 - Tell students that this anecdote should be true and involve an important

relationship in some way and that it can build on a sense of connection, if

students wish.


                 - Explain also that students will use a graphic organizer to record the overall

outline of their anecdote. Tell students that they will use sensory language to

describe their experiences.


                 - Tell students that sensory language is language that appeals or refers to

the five senses: taste, smell, sight, hearing, and touch. Students should ask

themselves: What did they see? What could they hear? If food was involved,

how did it taste and smell?


**TEKS 4.6.E** Make connections to personal experiences, ideas in other texts, and society; **TEKS 4.7.F** Respond using
newly acquired vocabulary as appropriate; **TEKS 4.10.G** Identify and explain the use of anecdote.


Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**68**


- Emphasize that students will not need to write up the full experience in story

form but that they should remember that the experience is still connected to

their narratives involving the special person they selected.


- Give students a few minutes to prepare their thoughts. Then have students

take turns sharing their anecdotes with a partner. You may wish to limit the

amount of time they have to tell the anecdote.


- Have students open their Activity Books to Activity Page 5.1. Read the

instructions aloud.


**Note** : The following content is from Activity Page 5.1.

~~**DRAFTING A PERSONAL NARRATIVE (30 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that today they will draft their personal narrative.


 - Ask students the following questions:


    - “What are two things a story needs to be a personal narrative?” _(It must_

_be a true story and told in a first person voice, from the perspective of the_

_person who experienced the events.)_


    - _“_ What does first-person sound like? What words would the author use?”

_(First-person voice uses the pronouns I, me, and my instead of the name of_

_the narrator or third-person pronouns such as she and her.)_


    - What point of view is _Letters from Heaven_ written in _? (It uses the first-_

_person perspective. The book tells about things that happen to Celeste_

_from her point of view using I/me/my pronouns.)_


 - Remind students that a personal narrative is about real events. Authors use their

memory of the events to include detailed descriptions of real events that happened,

including dialogue, actions or descriptive words, to the best of their ability.


 - Explain that students will now write a personal narrative of their own using

their plan from the last class. Direct students to Activity Pages 3.5 and 4.3. Tell

students they should use their plan to help them keep the events in order and

include descriptive details of the characters. Students are expected to write

legibly in cursive to complete assignments.


 - Direct students to Activity Page 5.2 and read the directions together. Then

students should begin their draft on the activity page, using additional lined

pages in the back of the Activity Book as needed. Students are expected to

write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.

strong connection to food and cooking?


» The relationship between Celeste and her grandmother.


2. **Literal.** What are some of the foods that Celeste’s grandmother used to

cook that Celeste has learned to cook?


» _cangrejitos de guayaba con queso, café con leche, congrí_


3. **Evaluative.** Why are food and cooking so important to Celeste?

_have_ → _you’ve._


Support


Show students a world
map and point out the
location of Cuba on the
map.



4. **Evaluative.** From where did Celeste’s grandmother get her recipes and

why is this important?


» They come from Cuba, the country where Celeste’s grandmother grew up.

Answers will vary about why this is important, but may include because the food

provides a link to Celeste’s and her grandmother’s cultural heritage.


- Explain that today students will read Excerpt 5, in which readers will learn

about more foods from Cuba.


- Ask students to turn to the new excerpt, “ _Mariquitas_ .” Read aloud the first two

paragraphs of the excerpt. Be sure to pronounce the _j_ in _m’ija_ as an _h_, and, if

needed, explain that the word is a contraction that is short for _mi hija_, meaning

_my daughter._


- You may also need to explain that Social Security is a government program

that provides income for many people, especially those who are retired or

disabled. Explain that this program paid money to Celeste’s grandmother, but,

following her death, the money stopped.


- Point out that Celeste realizes something about her mother in the beginning of

this excerpt.


1. **Literal.** What does Celeste realize about her mother?


» Celeste realizes that Mami doesn’t want to talk about her grandmother.


2. **Inferential.** What does Celeste think about Mami’s actions regarding

her grandmother? How do you know from the text?


» Responses will vary, but may include that Celeste thinks it is strange or odd

that her mother doesn’t want to talk about her grandmother, or that it makes

Celeste upset. I know because in the text Celeste says “Now that I think about

it, she doesn’t talk about Grandma at all!” “Or, even worse, as if she’d never even

been here with us.”


3. **Evaluative.** Why do you think Celeste’s mother is behaving in this way?


» Answers will vary but may include that it may be too sad for Mami to think about

the death of her mother, the grandmother.


- Have students read the rest of the excerpt on their own. Provide about

15 minutes.


- Explain the following:


   - Puerto Rico, like Cuba, is an island in the Caribbean Sea where Spanish

is spoken. However, Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States, while

Cuba is an independent country.



Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven

   - Though students will learn about _ropa vieja_ in an upcoming excerpt, for

now they only need to know that it is a traditional stew popular in Cuba.


   - Tell students that plantains are a green tropical fruit that look similar to

bananas, and that are used in many Cuban recipes.


- Focus on the word _nostalgia,_ which is used in the paragraph describing the

relationship between Grandma and Doña Esperanza.


- Ask students what they think _nostalgia_ means in this context. If necessary,

explain that nostalgia is wishing for an earlier period of time, when life was

easier and things were better—or at least they appear so in memory.


- Have students turn to the scene where Celeste remembers her grandmother

serving plantains to Karen and Silvia.


- Tell students to read this scene in the excerpt.


- Ask students what details they observe about the different languages used in

the excerpt.


   - Answers will vary but students should be able to cite examples of English

and Spanish.


- Allow students to share examples cited of both English and Spanish being

used in this scene.


- Point out the line where Celeste’s Grandmother says “Ma-ri-qui-ta,” slowly

to Silvia. Then point out the line where Silvia says “Ladybug” and Celeste’s

Grandmother repeats “Lei-di-bog.”, slowly.


- Ask students the following questions to allow for synthesizing:


1. **Inferential.** What do you think is happening in this exchange between

Silvia and Celeste’s Grandmother?


» Responses will vary, but students should pull out that Silvia and Celeste’s

Grandmother are teaching each other how to say words in a different language.


2. **Inferential.** Why do you think they are saying words slowly?


» Responses will vary, but may include that they are saying the words slowly to

help teach and learn the words in a new language.


3. **Evaluative.** Have you ever learned a new language or has someone ever

spoken to you in an unfamiliar language?


» Responses will vary, but allow students to make personal connections to the

text.

- Ask students to recall from their oral sharing with their partners in this lesson

what an anecdote is.


   - Students should recall that an anecdote is a short narrative that describes

an interesting incident or event.


- Ask students to identify the anecdote that is described within this excerpt.


- Ask students to explain how they knew this part of the excerpt was an

anecdote. If students need support identifying it, encourage them to pay

attention to the tense, or time that different parts of the excerpt take place.


   - Students should identify that the anecdote describes a memory of

Celeste’s when Silvia and Karen came over and Grandma brought out a

ripe plantain.


   - Elicit from students that although the story is told in chronological order,

this part of the excerpt moves backward in time and is rooted in a memory,

which we know because it starts with _One time._


- Call students’ attention to the paragraph that begins “When plantains are fried

green . . .” toward the end of the excerpt. Explain that this paragraph includes

several examples of what is called sensory language _._


6. **Literal.** What are the five senses?


» The five senses are hearing, sight, touch, smell, and taste.


7. **Evaluative.** What do you think the term _sensory language_ refers to?


» Answers will vary but may include that the term _sensory language_ refers to

words and phrases that appeal to one or more of the five senses.


- Tell students that sensory language helps readers create mental images in

their mind while they are reading. Have students identify examples of sensory

language from this paragraph.



Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**76**


   - Examples of words and phrases referring to the senses include color

words, such as _yellow_ and _black_, along with words that have to do with

texture and taste, such as _crunchy_ and _sweet._


- Tell students that you will give students an example of how the author uses

sensory language to create mental images for the reader. Explain that when

the text says, “She pointed to the plantain’s little black specks,” you imagine

something that looks like the inside of a banana. Grandma is holding a small

slice of the plantain, pointing to the black seeds on the inside. Celeste is

beside Grandma, examining the plantain closely. Tell students that they must

use the sensory language in the text and apply their own understanding in

order to create a mental image.


- Have students explain what they pictured in their mind while reading sensory

words and phrases from Excerpt 5.


- Display the two-column sensory language chart you prepared in advance.

Alternatively, create one on the board with the following headers for the

columns: Sensory Language and Mental Image.


   - Have students look through the excerpt in search of words and phrases

that function as sensory language.


   - Ask students to locate and give examples of sensory language.


   - Guide students to tell you in which column of the chart to place their

examples. Write the words and phrases in the appropriate place.


   - Ask students to explain the mental image that each example of sensory

language creates for them. Write their explanations on the chart.


- Review the words and phrases on the chart. Point out that because the excerpt

and the novel are largely about cooking and food, there will likely be other

examples of sensory language involving taste and smell later in the novel.

Encourage students to think of other words and phrases about cooking and

food that the author might use to create mental images for the reader. Add

them to the chart if time permits.

**Primary Focus:** Students will identify imagery and discuss settings in Excerpt 5

from _Letters from Heaven_ . ~~**[ TEKS 4.1.A; TEKS 4.8.D ]**~~


~~**IDENTIFYING IMAGERY IN EXCERPT 5 (20 MIN.)**~~


                 - Have students return to Excerpt 5, _“Mariquitas.”_


                 - Remind students that they read this excerpt during the previous lesson. Tell

them that today they will reread the excerpt, focusing on two things: imagery

and setting.


                 - Explain that the term _imagery_ is a type of descriptive language used in writing

that is sometimes figurative and therefore not to be taken literally.


                        - Review that figurative language means words or phrases that mean more

than their dictionary definition; similes, metaphors, and hyperbole are

examples of figurative language.


                        - Review that literal language means words and phrases that mean the

dictionary definition of the words: _That dog has sharp teeth_ is literal and

means that the dog has sharp teeth.


                        - In contrast, _That dog’s teeth are as sharp as knives_ is figurative imagery

and simply means that the dog’s teeth are very sharp. It does not mean

that the teeth are actually as sharp as knives.


                        - Explain that this type of imagery is a simile that uses hyperbole, or

exaggeration. Ask students what they remember about similes. If needed,

remind students that similes are direct comparisons between two things,

and often use the words “as” or “like” to compare. Tell students that

hyperbole is used in the excerpt they will examine from _Letters from_

_Heaven._


                - Have students find the dialogue in the supermarket between Celeste and Doña

Esperanza in Excerpt 5, starting with “Rice, Beans, Bread”.


**TEKS 4.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and make pertinent comments; **TEKS 4.8.D** Explain
the influence of the setting, including historical and cultural settings, on the plot.


Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**82**


 - Tell students that Doña Esperanza has a line of dialogue in this scene that is an

example of imagery and figurative language. Challenge them to find this line

and explain why it is an example of imagery and figurative language


 - Students should recognize that the line “That woman is so thin that if a strong

wind hit her, she’d end up miles away” is an example of figurative language.


1. **Evaluative** . Why is this sentence an example of figurative language?


» Answers will vary but should include that it is not true that a strong wind would

actually blow Lisa “miles away.”


2. **Evaluative** . Why is this sentence an example of imagery?


» Answers will vary, but students should recognize that this is an example of

imagery because it helps to create an image in the reader’s mind.


 - Point out that students can easily form an image in their heads of a very thin

woman being blown away by a powerful wind. Explain that this connection to

images is the reason why this device in storytelling is known as _imagery_ .


3. **Evaluative.** Why is this sentence an example of hyperbole?


» It overstates or exaggerates the truth.


 - Have students turn to the end of the excerpt. Remind them that this scene

takes place in Celeste’s kitchen and involves Celeste, her grandmother, and

her friends, Karen and Silvia. Tell them to look for a line of dialogue that uses

imagery or figurative language.


 - Students should identify Karen’s statement, “Celeste, you’re going to kill me,”

as an example of figurative language.


4. **Evaluative.** Why is this an example of figurative language?


» Answers will vary but may include that this is an example of figurative language

because Celeste isn’t actually going to kill Karen. The actual meaning of the

sentence is different from the words stated.


5. **Evaluative.** What is the figurative meaning of the sentence?


» Answers will vary but may include that Celeste is trying to make Karen sick.


6. **Evaluative.** What kind of figurative language is being used here? What

text evidence helps us know that the language is figurative?


» Hyperbole, because Karen’s statement exaggerates or overstates the truth.

Answers will vary, but students should cite Karen’s thoughts and words, as well

as Celeste’s grandma’s reaction to Karen’s statement in the text. Answers may

include that Karen thinks that she is going to get sick from eating the black

plantains, which she thinks are spoiled, and the green plantains, if they were

actually filled with ladybugs. We also know Karen is kidding, because she makes

Celeste’s grandmother laugh.


If students use the word exaggeration, remind them of the literary term for this

type of figurative language is _hyperbole._


**Note:** Ensure that students understand that the character is exaggerating

in this instance, and doesn’t really mean she is going to be killed. Explain to

students that while the author uses this in her novel, it is not a phrase that

should be used lightly.


- Explain that students will look at imagery and figurative language again later in

the lesson.


- Tell students that in this section of the lesson they will also be looking at the

setting of the story. Remind students that they have worked with setting in the

past, and ask students what the word _setting_ means in relation to a story or

other literary work.


» The setting is the time and place of the action in the story.


- Emphasize that an element of the setting is the time period during which the

story happens.


- Explain that stories may take place in the past and that these stories may be

examples of historical fiction. Add that some stories take place in the future

and that, if stories do not specify a time period, readers can expect that they

take place in in the present


- Explain that stories often have sections that take place in different settings.


- Read the following list of places aloud and ask students to raise their hands if

what you say is a setting in the story: Celeste’s school ( _yes_ ), Lisa’s house ( _no_ ),

the factory where Mami works ( _no_ ), Celeste’s living room ( _yes_ ), Grandma’s

house in Cuba ( _no_ ), the path between Celeste’s school and her home ( _yes_ ).


- Have students open their Activity Books to Activity Page 6.1. Have students

read the instructions. Explain that two parts of this excerpt are memories.

Ask students when memories take place. If needed, tell students that in these

parts Celeste is remembering something that happened in the past, or before

most of the story took place.


**Note:** The following comes from Activity Page 6.1.



Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**84**


**Activity Page 6.1**


**Identify Settings**


Excerpt 5 takes place in different settings. Reread the excerpt carefully and
use details in the text to determine two of the settings. Below, write the name
of the setting and then write two or three sentences describing what happens
in that place. Be as specific as possible, including when it took place.


_Possible responses:_


Setting 1: This setting is in Celeste’s house. Celeste is eating dinner with

her mother and Lisa, who are enjoying the food very much. Celeste is

missing her grandmother, because Mami doesn’t want to talk about her.

This takes place in the present.


Setting 2: This setting is the supermarket. Doña Esperanza and Celeste

are shopping. Celeste is thinking about the foods she might like to cook

and talking with Doña Esperanza. This takes place in the present.


**Note:** Students may identify the kitchen in Celeste’s memory as a

specific setting in the house. Clarify for students that these scenes take

place in the past. In this memory, Celeste is remembering a day when

Karen and Silvia came over. Karen thought the plantains in the kitchen

were bad, but Grandma explained that they were good to eat and made

excellent _mariquitas_ .


 - Check that students have found two settings. Then tell students that they will

return to the study of figurative language in the next part of the lesson.

                 - Ask student volunteers to share their understanding of definitions discussed

earlier in the lesson about figurative language, hyperbole, and imagery.


                 - Tell students that we will bring that discussion of writers’ use of hyperbole and

imagery into our reading, through the identification of a figurative language

device called simile in the text.


                 - Read the following two lines from Excerpt 1 aloud. You can also write them on

the board. Have students listen for how the excerpts are alike.


                        - Excerpt 1: “Such a bright green, like grass after a good rain.”


                        - Excerpt 1: “. . . the next day it might taste just like laundry water.”


1. **Literal** . What do you notice about each of these lines taken from

Excerpt 1 of the text?


» Student answers should include that both lines use the word _like_ and are types

of figurative language.


2. **Evaluative.** What function does the word _like_ play in each of these

sentences?


» It allows the author to compare one thing to another.


                - Remind students that comparisons involving _like_ or _as_ are known as similes.

Explain that similes often compare one thing to another that is actually not

very much like the first.


**TEKS 4.6.F** Make inferences and use evidence to support understanding; **TEKS 4.10.D** Describe how the author’s use of
imagery, literal and figurative language such as simile and metaphor, and sound devices such as alliteration and assonance
achieves specific purposes; **TEKS 4.7.E** Interact with sources in meaningful ways such as notetaking, annotating, freewriting,
or illustrating.


Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**86**


3. **Evaluative** . Ask students why the second simile, “. . . the next day

it might taste just like laundry water” is an example of figurative

language?


» Answers will vary but should include that it won’t actually taste like laundry

water. The sentence doesn’t mean what the words actually say.


- Point out that since it is doubtful that the _café con leche_ described in the

second excerpt tastes exactly like laundry water—water left over from washing

clothes, and therefore comparing the _café con leche_ to laundry water is a

hyperbole, since it is making an exaggeration.


4. **Evaluative.** What does Grandma mean when she compares the _café con_

_leche_ to laundry water?


» She means that it tastes bad.


5. **Literal.** In the first example, what is being compared to green grass

after the rain?


» Celeste is comparing her grandmother’s dress to the grass when it is brightest.


6. **Evaluate.** Why does this simile and use of figurative language show

something important to the main character?


» Celeste is showing how she thinks of her grandmother often and thinks fondly

of her.


- Tell students to open their Activity Books to Activity Page 6.2. Read the

instructions aloud or have students read them silently.

Now write a simile of your own. Use an object in the classroom and compare
it to something else using _like_ or _as_ .


» Answers will vary.


- Use prompts such as the following to guide students to complete the first

example:


   - How do you know this sentence is a simile?


    - It uses the word _like_ to compare two things.


   - What is the sentence about?


    - Stars


   - What are the stars being compared to?


   - Diamonds


   - What do you know about diamonds?


    - They are shiny; they are clear; they are very hard; they are valuable.


   - What is the simile saying about the stars?


    - They are bright and sparkly, in the same way that diamonds are bright

and sparkly.


- Have students fill in the meaning for the example of stars and diamonds. Then

have them continue working on the Activity Page on their own.


- Point out that at the bottom of the page students are given space to create

their own simile. When students are finished, have them share their similes

with partners. Have partners check that the similes include _like_ or _as_ and then

determine meaning.

with the statement “But Monday will be another day.” Encourage students to

look back at the text to review this statement.


 - Using this clue, have students predict when the first part of Excerpt 6 will take

place.


    - Students should predict that it will take place on Monday.


 - Read the first paragraph of Excerpt 6 aloud. Check on students’ predictions;

ask students to cite any details from the text that may support or refute their

predictions.


1. **Literal.** What are Mami and Celeste having for breakfast?


» They are having cereal, _café con leche_, and toast.


2. **Inferential.** Who do you think made the _café con leche_ ? Why do you

think so?


» Celeste. Reasons will vary but may include that we know Celeste knows how to

make very good _café con leche_ .


 - Have students read the rest of Excerpt 6 on their own. Ask them to read the

excerpt to look for examples of similes and other figurative language.


 - Ask students to name the similes they found. Write the similes on the board.

Ask students how they know these statements are similes. Underline the word

_like_ in each, and guide students to explain the meaning.


 - If students share other examples of figurative language or imagery, ask them

to explain if this is a simile and why. Students should synthesize what they

have learned about similes into their explanations.

Point out that in Celeste’s
dream the activity that
she enjoys so much,
dancing, scares her. Have
students write two or three
sentences explaining why
this might be and what it
says about Celeste’s life at
this point.




- Students may cite the following sentences from the excerpt that contain

similes, among other examples:


   - “I fell to the floor like a ripe mango.”


   - “From afar, they look like a perfect ten. . . .”


   - “. . . . I sound like an old lady.”


- Call students’ attention to the part of the excerpt in which Celeste describes

her dream. Ask students to describe the dream in their own words, referring

back to the text as needed.


3. **Evaluative.** Was this a good dream or a bad one? How do you know?


» Answers will vary, but may include that it was a bad dream because it was scary.

No one wants to be picked up by a tornado or to scream without anyone coming

to help.


4. **Literal.** What does Mami tell Celeste when she hears about the dream?


» “ _Cielo_ … I’m always near you.”


5. **Evaluative.** What does Mami mean when she says this?


» Answers will vary, but may include that she means that Celeste is never truly

alone, regardless of how she felt in the dream.


- Have students think about the following aspects of the dream and make

observations using the text to synthesize their ideas. Encourage them to

consider what these aspects mean for Celeste.


   - What did Celeste do in the dream that is one of her favorite things to do?

(dance)


   - Why didn’t Celeste like the dancing she did in the dream? (It was too fast

and made her feel out of control.)


   - What happened when she fell? (She couldn’t get up and no one came to

help her when she screamed.)


- Ask students to consider connections Celeste may have with other people

in her life, and how that might have impacted her dream. Direct students to

examine the text and discuss how her dream may be related to recent events

in Celeste’s life.


   - Student responses may vary, but may include that she is missing her

grandmother and may be worried that other people in her life will go away

as well, leaving her without anyone to help her.



Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**90**


- Ask what Celeste’s current life has to do with the part of the dream in which

she is dancing faster and faster. Students should synthesize using textual

evidence to build their ideas. Challenge students to refer back to previously

read excerpts.


   - Encourage students to use the concept of figurative language to explain

what “dancing faster and faster” might refer to, and how that might make

someone feel.


   - For example, students may use a simile to complete one of the sentence

frames: In her dream, Celeste was dancing like a ___________, because

she felt_______.; In her dream, Celeste was dancing as fast as a ________,

because she felt ________. Allow students to explain the simile they used

and how this could connect with how Celeste feels in her current life.


   - Students may infer that after Grandma’s death, Celeste likely feels as

though she can’t control anything, and the dream suggests that she isn’t

in control of much.


   - Call students’ attention to the simile in the retelling of the dream: _I fell to_

_the floor like a ripe mango._ Explain that a mango is a kind of tropical fruit

shaped like an oval, with a large stone or pit in the middle and that grows

on trees. Consider showing students a picture of a mango or mango tree.


   - Think, Pair, Share: Allow students to turn to a partner to briefly discuss

their analysis of Celeste’s dream and their answers to the question: Have

you ever had an experience that you can connect to the feelings Celeste

has in her dream? Explain.

~~**ELPS 3.D**~~



The simile, _I fell to the floor like a ripe mango,_ means that:


One possible answer is that the simile means Celeste is feeling helpless.
When a mango ripens, it falls to the ground and does not move. The simile
shows that she can’t do anything to stop the bad things that are happening.
Another possible meaning of the simile is that growth or development of a
relationship, such as the one with her grandmother, has stopped abruptly.
Encourage students to think of other possible answers, including the
meaning of the word “ripe”.


- As time permits, have two or three students share their interpretation of the

simile.


- Wrap up this section of the lesson by noting that students will continue

working with imagery and similes in their writing.

- Students will listen to or read their partners’ plans with thoughtfulness. Then

they will use a checklist to provide feedback on the plan.


   - Review how to give feedback in a way that is positive, respectful, and

encouraging. If necessary, model how to do this.


- Have students turn to Activity Page 6.5 in their Activity Books. Explain that

after reading each other’s drafts, they will switch Activity Books to complete

the peer review checklist in each other’s books. They will read the statements

on the checklist and add marks in the “yes” and “no” columns for each

corresponding statement. They may also add comments to the checklist that

helps the writer think about how to improve their writing. The goal is to provide

feedback in a way that is easy to understand.


- Read the directions aloud. Then review the items on the checklist.


   - Point out that since the personal narrative is a first draft, some checklist

items may be missing or unclear.


   - Tell students that it is fine to add comments that answer for the writer,

“How can I improve my writing?”


   - Students should understand that the comments they give their peers

should be specific and can be a good way of reminding the writers to keep

particular ideas or details in mind when they revise.


- Give students an opportunity to share their work either by reading their drafts

aloud to partners or by reading the partner’s work silently.


- Provide one or two minutes for questions and answers as needed.

~~**MAKING INFERENCES ABOUT A CHARACTER (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Introduce Excerpt 7 by explaining that this part of the story immediately

follows the previous excerpt, in which Celeste talked to Silvia and Karen about

not wanting to go to dance class any more. Note to the class that Celeste

admits to the reader that this is not the truth.


 - Explain that a new character is introduced in this part of the excerpt. Tell

students that the new character is named Amanda and that she is a fellow

student with whom Celeste and her friends have a difficult relationship.


 - Tell students that, as they read the excerpt, they should look for information

about Amanda and her connection to the other characters, making sure to use

textual evidence to support their observations and ideas with details.


 - Read aloud the first two paragraphs of Excerpt 7 as students follow along,

stopping at “I’d be so happy”. Point out the word _mockingly_, which describes

how Amanda is speaking.


 - Ask students to explain the meaning of _mockingly_ .


    - Students should make inferences from the text that if something is said

mockingly, it is in a rude or contemptuous way. When someone is mocking

another, they are usually making fun of the person.


    - Point out that “So the ghost of your grandmother writes you letters” is a

line of dialogue in the novel, and that it is spoken by Amanda.


    - Ask students to put their thumbs up if they think this line of dialogue is

said mockingly by Amanda.

Support


To help students further
understand the emotions
in this scene, have students
read other lines aloud.
Coach them as necessary
to get the right intonation
and expression.




   - Ask students to put their thumbs down if they think this line of dialogue is

not said mockingly by Amanda.


   - Allow student volunteers to share and explain their choices using evidence

from the text.


   - Remind students that mocking (and bullying) are not qualities of a good

friend.


1. **Inferential.** What inferences can you make about Amanda just from reading

the dialogue?


» Answers will vary but may include that Amanda is saying unkind things to Celeste

and in a rude way, so she seems to be a mean person who doesn’t like Celeste.


2. **Evaluative.** What ideas about Amanda’s personality might you get as a

reader from the image in your mind of her “swinging her long blond braids”

as she walks?


» Answers will vary but may include that she is confident and even the way Amanda

walks might be seen as a challenge to other people.


 - Have students read the rest of the excerpt independently.


3. **Literal.** What is Celeste’s reaction to Amanda’s treatment?


» Celeste tells Amanda to stop and walks away. She stands up for herself verbally by

threatening to make the ghost of her grandmother haunt Amanda.


 - Point out that Celeste refuses help from Silvia because she says she can

handle it on her own.


4. **Literal.** What is the relationship like between Silvia and Celeste right now?

Why?


» Responses will vary but may include that the relationship between the two girls

is not as good as usual. Silvia is surprised by Celeste saying she doesn’t want

to dance anymore, and Celeste refuses Silvia’s help when Amanda is mean to

her. In addition, Silvia did not believe Celeste about receiving letters from her

grandmother, which have hurt Celeste’s feelings


5. **Evaluative.** How might the current relationship affect Celeste’s feelings

about receiving Silvia’s help in dealing with Amanda?


» Answers will vary but may include that it might mean that Celeste feels like she is

on her own and has no other choice but to stand up for herself, she doesn’t want

to receive Silvia’s help


 - Ask students to recall what they have learned about the concept of _voice._

If needed, remind students that voice is the expression of an author’s or

narrator’s point of view and attitude about what’s going on in the story.



Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**102**


 - Introduce the concept of _tone._ Tell students that _tone_ means the attitude

that a character, narrator, or author conveys through their words, expressed

through style and word choice.


 - Tell students that both voice and tone help reveal the thoughts and emotions

of characters.


6. **Evaluative.** How would you describe the voice and tone used by Celeste as

she narrates the encounter with Amanda? What does it tell you about what

she is thinking and feeling?


» Answers will vary but may include that her narrated voice is assertive or matter

of fact, and the tone makes her character seem angry and hurt. Support students

as needed with this response, and reread lines from the excerpt aloud that

demonstrate her tone if necessary. Encourage students to cite details and use the

text to make their observations.


 - Ask students what words and phrases Celeste uses to describe her feelings

and thoughts. Help students understand how descriptions such as “if only I

could hibernate” and “trying to hide the fury in my voice” show Celeste’s state

of mind.


 - Have students discuss with a partner how they feel voice and tone are used to

help the reader understand Amanda’s character.


 - Invite students to share the results of their conversations.


 - Encourage students to discuss phrases such as _a toothy smile plastered on_

_her face_ .


 - Ask students to make inferences about what the phrase means in context of

the excerpt.


   - Answers will vary but students should make inferences using textual

evidence.


 - Hand out students’ Activity Books and have students open the books to

Activity Page 7.1. Read the instructions aloud or have a student volunteer do

so. Emphasize that students should look at both dialogue and actions to help

them fill out the organizer.

words and then give one piece of evidence from the text to support their
conclusion.


Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**104**


~~**READING EXCERPT 7 (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain that students will summarize Excerpt 7 after you model summarizing

Excerpt 6.


 - Ask students for a definition of the terms _summarize_ and _summary_ . Students

should remember that these terms mean giving a brief statement that

explains the main points of a literary work, such as this excerpt.


 - Model _summarizing_ as follows:


    - Tell students that you are going to summarize what they read in Excerpt 6.

Then say the following:


    - Let me remind myself what we know about the excerpt. The excerpt starts

with Celeste complaining to Mami about her having to work so much.

There are a lot of lines of dialogue between Celeste and Mami, but I don’t

need to include them in my summary. Remember that a summary is a

brief statement, so I don’t put in dialogue and every detail. All I need to say

to summarize is this:


_Celeste tells her mother that she wants her to be home more and work less,_

_but Mami assures Celeste that it’s all right and won’t last forever._


    - Let me think about what happens next. Then Celeste tells Mami about

her dream. The most important things about her dream are that it was a

nightmare and that it involved being blown by the wind, being dropped

onto the floor, and screaming without anybody coming to help. I don’t

need to put in all the information about the dream, just the most important

parts. So I’ll summarize this part by saying:


_Celeste tells her mother about a bad dream she had in which the wind_

_was blowing her back and forth. Later she fell and started to scream, but_

_nobody came to help her._


I’ll add one more detail to my summary that is important to understanding

the story:


_Her mother tells Celeste that she will always be there for her._


    - Tell students to reread the next part of Excerpt 6, about Celeste, Karen and

Silvia at school. Ask students to think about how they might summarize

this part of the excerpt in a sentence or two.


    - Remind students: There’s a lot of dialogue in this scene that doesn’t need

to be included in the summary. Remind students that a summary is short

and only includes the most important details.


Lesson 7 Summarizing
**105**


Challenge


Have students give a brief
summary of a book or
short story they recently
read. Remind them to keep
it short.


Support


Some students may have
difficulty taking notes while
speaking. If that is the
case, they can ask their
partners to take notes that
both students can use.




   - Have students share their summaries of the last scene in the excerpt.


   - After a few volunteers share a summary of the second half of Excerpt 6,

you may


   - model summarizing as follows:


_Celeste’s friends ask whether she danced at the studio during the weekend,_

_and Celeste tells them she isn’t interested in dance any more—which_

_isn’t true._


- Review with students the characteristics of a summary: it is brief and tells the

most important things that happen. Add that summaries of stories usually

follow the sequence of the story in order. You may wish to write your summary

of Excerpt 6 on the board, annotating the sequence of events by numbering

each detail.


- Tell students that they will now work with a partner to read then summarize

Excerpt 7 orally.


- Point out that Excerpt 7 has two scenes, both of them involving Amanda.


- Have students reread Excerpt 7. Then have them practice summarizing the

excerpt with their partners. Encourage students to include information on the

relationship between the characters in their summary.


- Circulate, making sure that students are on task and working to find the most

important parts of the excerpt. Tell students that they may wish to annotate by

circling key lines in the excerpt or jotting down a note of their thoughts.


- Remind students that they can ask each other questions about the details in

the excerpts to monitor each other’s comprehension.


- When students have completed their discussions, move on to the Writing

portion of the lesson.

 - Tell students that they will now revisit their personal narratives they have been

working on. Remind students that in the last lesson, they received feedback

from a partner on their personal narrative. Tell students that now, they will look

back at their writing again and focus on revising their work to improve details.


 - Remind students that in Unit 1, they revised their personal narratives to

include sensory details. Explain that they will use the skill of revising again to

make their narrative seem more real to the reader.


 - Have students take out Activity Page 6.4. Allow students to silently reread their

sensory paragraphs.


 - Tell students that their first opportunity to revise their writing will be to find a

spot in their personal narrative where they can add this sensory paragraph.


 - Direct students to their personal narrative draft, beginning on Activity

Page 5.2. Give students five minutes to revise their personal narrative by

adding their sensory paragraph. Students are expected to write legibly in

cursive to complete assignments.


 - Tell students that the other revisions they will make in this lesson will be to

show personality traits and the relationship between people in their narrative.

Explain that they will do so by rereading their writing and finding where people

interact with each other. Tell students to underline these places in their draft

and number them in the margin.


 - After students have underlined the interactions in their narratives, direct

students to use the underlined text to complete the chart on Activity

Page 7.2. Explain that they will start by writing down the interaction in the

first column. Then, students will add dialogue and action details, to help show

the personality traits of the people in their story. For instance, in Excerpt 6

when Celeste’s mother is speaking to her, the Excerpt says: “ _Cielo_,” she says

tenderly. “I’m always near you.” The author used the word “tenderly” to show

that Celeste’s mother is a loving person. Tell students that this also helps the

reader to understand the relationship between Celeste and her mother.


                  - Tell students that after completing their revisions table, they will share their

revisions with a partner who can provide additional suggestions. In the last row

of their chart, they should add any changes needed based on the peer review.

After completing the chart, it will be time to return to the drafts and make the

revisions.

of Cuban _ropa vieja_ for student reference. ( _Ropa vieja_ translates to “old
clothes,” and is said to have come from a penniless man who couldn’t feed
his family, so he shredded and cooked his own clothes. As he cooked, he
prayed, and a miracle was said to occur - the mixture turned into a meatfilled stew.) Consider showing students the image of traditional _ropa vieja_
you prepared in advance.


- Explain that both Celeste and Doña Esperanza clearly like _ropa vieja_ . Ask

students what textual evidence supports this.


- Explain that different people have different perspectives, or ways of looking at

something. Celeste begins crying while they cook, but Doña Esperanza does

not. What could explain these different reactions to the same activity?


- Tell students to think about the perspectives or points of view in Excerpt 8.

As the narrator, the entire story is told from Celeste’s point of view. We know

more about Celeste’s perspective than that of any other character. There are

also opportunities in the story to figure out other characters’ points of view.



Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**114**


- Give an example of different perspectives using the following Think Aloud:


   - I’m looking at the argument between Silvia and Celeste. Both girls have

a very different way of looking at what happened. We can say their

perspectives are not the same.


   - We can compare and contrast their perspectives—(ask students to recall

what _compare_ and _contrast_ means from their previous learning.)


   - From Celeste’s point of view, the argument happened because Silvia

keeps making comments. On this day Silvia tells Celeste that she has to

recognize that her grandmother is dead. That makes Celeste angry. She

can’t control herself, so she lashes out and says “leave me alone” in a tone

that demonstrates her frustration.


   - We can figure out a character’s perspective by paying close attention to

what they say and do.


   - We can make an inference that Silvia thinks there’s something wrong with

Celeste when she says, “Celeste, you worry me…” But when Silvia says,

“you have to accept that your grandma died, forever” to Celeste, Celeste

responds in anger.


2. **Literal.** Who are the other characters that will have different

perspectives in this excerpt?


» Karen, Lisa, and Doña Esperanza


- Have students open to Activity Page 8.1. Read the instructions aloud or ask a

student volunteer to do so.


**Note:** The following comes from Activity Page 8.1.

**115**


|Question|Response|Textual Evidence|
|---|---|---|
|1. What is Celeste’s<br>perspective<br>regarding the<br>argument she is<br>having with Silvia?|• Celeste thinks she is<br>justifed in being mad<br>because Silvia keeps<br>trying to tell her that<br>her grandmother is<br>dead, which Celeste<br>knows. However, she<br>also feels bad about<br>what she said to Silvia.|• “I immediately feel<br>horrible about saying<br>that. But I’m so sick of<br>her comments. What<br>does she know about<br>what’s happening to<br>me?”|
|2. What is Lisa’s<br>perspective<br>regarding the<br>letters Celeste is<br>receiving from her<br>grandmother?|• Lisa isn’t at all<br>surprised that Celeste<br>is still hearing from<br>her grandmother,<br>because Lisa<br>personally believes<br>that when people die,<br>part of them is still<br>able to teach.|• “When people die,<br>there’s a part of<br>them that stays here,<br>with us . . . and they<br>continue to talk to us<br>and teach us things.”|
|3. What is Celeste’s<br>perspective<br>regarding the letter<br>she receives from<br>her grandmother?|• Celeste is excited and<br>delighted, but she’s<br>also a little bit sad<br>because she thinks<br>this might be the last<br>letter.|• “Grandma’s letter<br>leaves me feeling a<br>bit sad. I wonder if<br>this will be the last I<br>receive.”|
|4. What is Doña<br>Esperanza’s<br>perspective<br>regarding this letter?|• Doña Esperanza is<br>incredibly excited,<br>partly because she<br>really wants to have<br>Grandma’s recipe for<br>_ropa vieja_.|• She hurries over<br>with groceries and<br>tears the letter out<br>of Celeste’s hands to<br>read it properly.|



- Possible answers given.







Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**116**


Check for Understanding


Ask students to compare and contrast the perspectives of Doña
Esperanza and Celeste about the last letter that arrived.


- Tell students that people form their perspectives for many reasons. One way

that people form their perspective is through their experiences. Have the

students imagine a noisy lunchroom on the first day of school. Some people

may enjoy this and have fun. Others may find it overwhelming. Different people

can feel different ways about the same situation depending on their personal

backgrounds and experiences.


- Close this part of the lesson by asking two or three volunteers to share their

answer to one of the items on Activity Page 8.1.


~~**WHAT IS AN ADVERTISEMENT?**~~


- Have students look at the sentence in which Celeste looks at the mail. Call

students’ attention to the phrase _in between the bills and advertisements_ .


1. **Literal.** What is an advertisement?


» An advertisement is a notice or announcement, especially one intended to sell a

product.


2. **Inferential.** What is the purpose of advertising?


» Advertising tries to get people to buy goods or services or sometimes to

support a cause.


- Tell students that they can find advertisements in many places, including:

on TV, within locally approved resources, in newspapers or magazines, in

phone apps, on buildings, billboards, trains or buses. Ask students to think of

an advertisement they have seen that they thought was effective in getting

people to buy a product. Have one or two students share the ads they are

thinking of, and have them explain why they thought the ad was effective.


   - Answers will vary. Help students distinguish between ads that they

thought were funny or entertaining and ads that they thought were

successful in getting someone to buy a product.

**Lesson 8: Looking at Perspective**
###### Writing 60m


**Primary Focus**

Students will apply feedback and make revisions.


~~**TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.11.C**~~


Students will edit their writing for standard English language conventions.


~~**TEKS 4.7.E; TEKS 4.11.C; TEKS 4.11.D.vii; TEKS 4.11.D.x**~~


~~**FINAL REVISIONS AND EDITING (60 MIN.)**~~


                  - Tell students that in the rest of this lesson they will revise and edit their

personal narratives. They will also have the opportunity to have a writing

conference with the teacher for additional feedback, as needed.


                 - Point out or remind students of the difference between revising and editing a

document.


                 - When writers revise, they are concerned mainly with bigger-picture items,

such as organization, adding, and deleting details; when they edit, they tend to

be more concerned with grammar, punctuation, and capitalization.


                 - Remind students that they have edited their work in previous units. In this

lesson, students will finish any remaining revisions from the last class and

then move on to editing.


                 - Explain that when students revise, they will pay close attention to the details

they have worked on in previous lessons such as sensory details, dialogue,

actions, and figurative language.


                 - Use the following questions to get students thinking about relationships in

stories and other pieces of writing.


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.11.C** Revise drafts to improve sentence structure
and word choice by adding, deleting, combining, and rearranging ideas for coherence and clarity; **TEKS 4.7.E** Interact with
sources in meaningful ways such as notetaking, annotating, freewriting, or illustrating; **TEKS 4.11.D** Edit drafts using standard
English conventions including (vii) pronouns, including reflexive; (x) punctuation marks, including apostrophes in possessives,
commas in compound sentences, and quotation marks in dialogue.


Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**118**


- Ask students to think about the relationships they are describing in their

personal narratives. Remind students that they originally described the

importance of the relationship between themselves and one other person.

Remind students that in the text they are reading, some of Celeste’s

relationships in _Letters from Heaven_ were impacted by other people or events.

Tell students that sometimes relationships change or can be impacted by

other people or things. Have students consider the following questions for

their personal narrative:


   - Tell students to think about the relationship they wrote about in their

personal narratives. Did another person or event ever change your

relationship with this individual?


   - Remind students of the importance of food in the narrative _Letters from_

_Heaven._ Ask them what helped connect the people in their narratives.

What interests did they share? What places were important to them? How

did they know each other?


- When students are ready, instruct them to collect the pieces of their personal

narratives, including their peer feedback, revision checklist, and editing

checklist.


- Direct students to use Activity Page 7.2, where they revised dialogue and

actions in their narratives, to complete their revisions.


- Next, have students edit their documents. Tell students to open to Activity

Page 8.2. Tell students that they will use this as an editing checklist. Review

rules of punctuation, especially end punctuation and capitalization. Emphasize

the need to put dialogue inside quotation marks. Remind students that they

thought about pronouns earlier in the process; tell them to be sure their

pronoun use is correct.

Editing Checklist


_Use this checklist to help you edit your personal narrative._



4. I have used question marks appropriately at the ends

of sentences.


5. I have used exclamation marks appropriately at the ends

of sentences.






                 - The final step students should complete is to publish their work using the lined

pages in the back of their Activity Book . You may also opt to have students

type their published copy using a word processor. The final product should be

legible and ready to share during the next lesson. Students are expected to

write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.


                - While students are working on their drafts, the teacher should meet with

individual students for writing conferences, as time allows. It is recommended

that you meet with students who need the most support, as determined by

teacher observation and formative assignments up to this lesson, first. During

the conference you should:


                        - Review the student’s writing, their dialogue and actions revisions (from

Activity Page 7.2), and their editing checklist (Activity Page 8.2)


                        - Ask the student to offer areas of strength and areas in need of

improvement


                        - Offer specific feedback to support student mastery of the unit’s writing

objectives for personal narratives such as: word choice, characterization

details, and plot sequence, in addition to editing.

Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**126**


    - Point out that the text doesn’t directly state everything important about

having told the truth!” She doesn’t want to apologize for telling what really

happened.


14. **Inferential.** How does each character feel at the end of the excerpt? Look

back at the text to support your inferences.


» Answers will vary but should include evidence from the text.



Support


Be sure students know
where to find the answers
to the questions by helping
students to locate these
events, actions, and lines of
dialogue in the text.



Lesson 9 Examining Characters’ Emotions and Relationships
**127**


Challenge


Have students develop
their own questions
like these relating to
Celeste’s emotions
and relationships. Have
partners ask and answer
each other’s questions.




 - Have students generate words and phrases to describe Celeste’s emotions

during this scene. Possible answers include _sad, uncomfortable, angry, hurt,_

_embarrassed, frustrated, and ashamed_ among others.


   - Encourage students to explain how they knew the word or phrase applied

to Celeste by using textual evidence.


   - For example, _Celeste is uncomfortable because she can’t wait to get out of_

_the principal’s office._


 - Review/summarize the questions and answers to help students get a better

sense of Celeste’s relationships, especially with Silvia. Remind students we

are using details from the text to support our thinking. Ask the following

questions:


1. **Evaluative.** Do you think Silvia is justified in being worried about Celeste?

Why or why not?


» Answers will vary.


2. **Evaluative.** Do you think Celeste is justified in being angry with Silvia?

Explain.


» Answers will vary.


3. **Inferential.** How do Celeste’s emotions change over the course of the

scene in the principal’s office? What happens that leads you to make this

inference?


» Answers may vary, but students may reference Celeste’s interactions with Silvia.

Remind students to use textual evidence to support their responses.


4. **Evaluative.** Do you think Celeste’s apology is genuine? Why or why not?


» Answers may vary; students should support their inferences with textual

evidence.


5. **Evaluative.** What do you notice about Celeste’s comment to her mother, “Of

course Grandma has been writing to me”?


» Students may point out that she says this line of dialogue in Spanish.


6. **Evaluative.** Why do you think she says this line in Spanish?


» Answers will vary, but might include that it’s possible she thinks no one else in

the room will understand her if she speaks in Spanish, and she wants to keep the

communication just between her and her mother.


7. **Literal.** Why does Celeste say she didn’t tell her mother about the letters

earlier? Use evidence from the text to support your answer.


» She didn’t want to make her mother feel sad.



Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**128**


8. **Evaluative.** What does this say about Celeste’s relationship toward her

mother?


» Answers will vary but may include that she cares deeply about her mother’s well
being.


~~**PARTNER READ (30 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask students to explain the definition of theme from earlier in the unit.


 - Remind students that a text can have multiple themes.


 - Allow students to share themes that have come up in the excerpts of the novel

they have read so far.


   - Answers will vary, but students should recall that themes are big ideas that

come up repeatedly in a text and touch on ideas that connect all people.


 - Tell students that they will be working with a partner to discuss the theme of

relationships in the novel. Explain that they will primarily use Excerpt 9 as a

reference point but that they may also need to use earlier excerpts to help

them answer some of the questions.


 - Tell students that they will be looking at Celeste’s relationships with others—in

particular, with Silvia, Mami, Doña Esperanza, and Lisa. Explain that partners

will choose three of these relationships to look at in depth, using evidence

from the text to describe these relationships and, if appropriate, to show how

the relationships grow and change.


 - Assign partners or have students find their own.


 - Have students open to Activity Page 9.1.


 - Read the instructions aloud. Have students follow along.


 - Walk students through the process on the board, using the example of the

relationship between Doña Esperanza and Lisa. Draw a row from the chart on

the board, and fill in the first blank with the words “Doña Esperanza and Lisa.”

Then use a Think Aloud such as the following:


   - Earlier in the book we learned that Doña Esperanza thought that Lisa

shouldn’t be a vegetarian, so I think that the relationship between them is

a little bit difficult and that Doña Esperanza judges Lisa.


   - I’ll write that in the second box, because it’s my opinion, or ‘What I Think.’


   - In the third box I’ll put my evidence, which is that Doña Esperanza calls

Lisa “that Lisa,” which doesn’t sound very nice, and is critical of her eating

habits. This is a way of annotating to show what I think.



Activity Page 9.1


Support


Explain to students that a
vegetarian is a person who
chooses not to eat meat.
They may make this choice
for their health, religion, or
personal ethical reasons.



Lesson 9 Examining Characters’ Emotions and Relationships
**129**


                        - But there might be other perspectives about the relationship between Lisa

and Doña Esperanza. My partner might have a different opinion.


                        - Maybe my partner thinks that they really like each other; it’s just that Doña

Esperanza likes to tease Lisa. That would be another opinion, and I’ll write

that in the fourth box, ‘What My Partner Thinks.’


                        - Any opinion is valid as long as we can support our opinions with what is in

the text.


                - Be sure that students understand that they only need to annotate and provide

textual evidence for their own ideas, not their partners’; they just need to

record what their partner thinks.


                 - Point out that relationships between characters change over the course of the

novel; encourage students to include changes in the relationships as part of

You and your partner will choose three of the following characters: Doña
Esperanza, Mami, Lisa, and Silvia.


Describe the relationship between Celeste and each of these people. Explain
how the relationship changes over time in the novel. Write what you think,
and write what your partner thinks too. Annotate by using quotes and other

- Answers will vary according to the characters chosen and students’ opinions.


Check for Understanding


Have students choose one of the characters they wrote about. Have them
tell you the annotations or textual evidence they used to support their
opinion of that character’s relationship with Celeste.


- If time permits, wrap up this part of the lesson by asking students to share

their work. If possible, ask them to share a relationship about which they

disagreed with their partners. Remind students that as long as they can

produce textual evidence to support their opinion, their ideas are legitimate

and make sense.

###### Reading 45m


**Primary Focus:** Students will describe changes in the characters Celeste and Mami

and in their relationship.


~~**TEKS 4.6.F; TEKS 4.6.H; TEKS 4.7.A; TEKS 4.7.D; TEKS 4.8.B**~~


~~**READING EXCERPT 10 (45 MIN.)**~~


 - Briefly review with students the events of Excerpt 9, “Misunderstandings,”

which students read during the previous lesson. Model citing evidence from

the text.


1. **Literal.** Describe the setting of this excerpt.


» It takes place in the principal’s office.


2. **Literal.** What secret does Silvia give away during this meeting?


» She says that Celeste was claiming that her grandmother was writing her

letters.


3. **Evaluative.** How do you think this setting influences Celeste’s reaction

to Silvia giving away the secret?


» Answers will vary, but the text tells us that Celeste is feeling ashamed and Mami

feels shocked at a meeting in the principal’s office. This may have caused a

different reaction than in another setting.


4. **Inferential.** How does Celeste feel during and after this meeting?


» Answers will vary, but should be supported by details in the text. Responses

may include feelings such as: uncomfortable, embarrassed, ashamed, or

defensive.


 - Point out that Excerpt 9 ends with Celeste knowing that she and her mother

will have to talk later in the day.


 - Explain that in today’s lesson, students will read about this discussion. As they

read, they should pay particular attention to and make observations on how

the characters of Celeste and Mami have changed since the beginning of the

story and to any changes that have occurred in their relationship.


**TEKS 4.6.F** Make inferences and use evidence to support understanding; **TEKS 4.6.H** Synthesize information to create
new understanding; **TEKS 4.7.A** Describe personal connections to a variety of sources; **TEKS 4.7.D** Retell, paraphrase, or

the changes they undergo.


Lesson 10 Recognizing Changes in Characters
**137**


Support


Guide students to locate
the sentence “The
bushes look like they are
covered with butterflies.”
Explain the imagery in
the sentence. If they need
some help understanding
the imagery, have them
sketch a picture.


Challenge


Have students locate and
explain the imagery in the
sentence “The bushes
look like they are covered
with butterflies.” Then ask
them to think of figurative
language they could use to
describe the flowers.


Challenge


After students finish their
independent reading,
ask them to explain the
meaning of Celeste’s
statement: “It’s almost
like it used to be with
Grandma.” Why does
Celeste say this? How is
this statement related
to a big idea or theme of
changes that has come up
in the novel?




- Have students open to the beginning of Excerpt 10. Read the first three

paragraphs aloud, stopping at “I’ll explain it to them”, while students follow

along.


   - You may wish to have students read the lines of dialogue, one playing the

role of Celeste and the other playing the role of Lisa. Encourage them to

read with expression and to think about what each character is feeling.

Reference earlier learning on voice and tone.


   - Pause after the line “they aren’t yours!” Ask students what they think

_protesting_ means based on Celeste’s words.


   - Help students emphasize Celeste’s alarm that Lisa is taking flowers that

don’t belong to her.


- Ask students to turn and talk with a partner about the following question: Do

you agree with Lisa that Celeste needs to show the letters to her mother?


- After a brief discussion between partners, ask for volunteers to share their

answers and support from the text.


- Ask students to turn and talk, again, with a partner about the following

question: Do you think showing Mami the letters will change her thinking in

any way? Explain.


- After the brief discussion between partners, ask for volunteers to share their

answers and support from the text.


- Point out that the title of the excerpt is “Asking for Help.”


- Ask students to make an inference about why this is the title of the excerpt.


- Allow student volunteers to share their inferences using textual evidence.


- Ask whether Celeste is asking Lisa for help. ( _No, she is not._ )


- Is Lisa trying to help Celeste? Explain using evidence from the text. ( _Yes, she_

_is; she is giving Celeste flowers to help her cheer up and feel better about her_

_situation._ )


- Have students brainstorm other ways that Lisa could have helped Celeste.


- Read the next three paragraphs aloud, culminating in the sentence “And, for

an instant, I think we are not walking alone.”


- Ask students what Celeste means when she says this while they are walking.


   - Celeste feels the presence of her grandmother.


- Have students continue reading the excerpt independently.


- When students are finished, ask two or three volunteers to summarize parts of

the excerpt.



Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**138**


 - Ask students what they think _cielo_ might mean, based on how Mami uses it

in the text. After hearing students’ responses, tell students that _cielo_ means

darling, a term of endearment or affection.


 - Ask students what they notice about this interaction between Mami and

Celeste that could be related to changes in the characters.


    - Answers will vary. Point out that the part of the scene students read

independently involves Mami and Celeste bonding in the kitchen while

preparing food.


 - Ask students to share how food has played an important role throughout the

text.


    - Answers will vary but students should note that food has been an

important part of the text and the way that Celeste bonded with Grandma.


 - Remind students that they have seen Celeste reject help before, such as

when Silvia tried to help her push back against Amanda’s teasing. In her

grandmother’s most recent letter, she explained that it is always acceptable to

ask for help and that most people like to help.


 - Allow students to think about times they have asked for help when needed, or

chosen not to ask for help.


 - Encourage students to make text to text connections by thinking about

connecting the way the character Celeste dealt with asking for help in _Letters_

_from Heaven_ to other characters in books they have read or movies they have

seen. (If students are able to think of similar characters, allow them to share

and explain.)


5. **Literal.** What does Celeste say about the impact the letters have had on

her?


» She says the letters have helped her feel less sad about her grandmother’s

death.


6. **Inferential.** The last line of the excerpt says “I think I know what

Grandma was trying to tell me…” In your opinion, what does Celeste

think her grandmother was trying to tell her?


» Answers will vary but students may note that Grandma seems to think it is

important and perhaps even necessary to ask people for help.


7. **Evaluative.** Have you seen Celeste accept help in the story? If so, when?


» Answers will vary but students should say yes. One possible example is when

she got help with making the _ropa vieja_ from Doña Esperanza, for example.


Lesson 10 Recognizing Changes in Characters
**139**


Activity Page 10.1



8. **Inferential.** What do you think Celeste might do in the next excerpt? Be

as specific as possible and support your prediction with evidence from

the text.


» Responses will vary, but might include that she might ask someone for help,

such as asking Silvia to help her deal with Amanda after all or trying to get back

to dance class even though her mother can no longer afford the lessons.


 - Ask students to look back at the text and think about how the characters

Mami and Celeste have changed since the beginning of the book.


 - Ask them also to think about whether the relationship between Mami and

Celeste has changed. If so, students should be prepared to explain how, using

textual evidence.


 - Give students a few moments to think and have them jot down a few notes to

record their thinking.


 - Then assign students partners, or have them choose partners.


 - Allow students to talk about how Mami and Celeste have changed with their

partners. Tell students to share their responses to the questions above with

their partners, referring to their notes for assistance.


 - After a few minutes, have them open their Activity Books to Activity Page 10.1.

Tell students to continue their discussions based on the questions on the

Activity Page using Excerpt 10 to help them answer the questions.


   - Students should write their own answers in their books; even if they are in

agreement with their partners, each student needs to use their own words

to answer each question.


**Note** : The following comes from Activity Page 10.1.


**Activity Page 10.1**


Discussion Questions


Talk about the following questions with your partner, using Excerpt 10 to
help you. Then write your answers below. Use complete sentences with
appropriate capitalization and punctuation.


_Possible answers are shown._


1. What does Celeste say she wants?


» She wants to go back to dance class and have her mother spend less time

working.



Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**140**


2. What else does Celeste want, even if she doesn’t say it to the reader?


» She wants her grandmother back, she wants Amanda to stop picking on her, and

she wants her friends to believe her about the letters.


3. How has Celeste changed in the story so far? What has helped her change?


» Celeste has learned to cook some traditional foods independently after

reading her grandmother’s letters. She has gone through some changes in her

relationships with friends and family. Students should use textual evidence to

support their responses.


4. How has Mami changed in the story so far? What has helped her change?


» In the beginning of the story, it was difficult for Mami to talk about Celeste’s

grandmother, likely because it made her too sad. However, now Mami is talking to

Celeste about her mother after Celeste shows her the letters. Students may make

an inference that Celeste sharing the letters and cooking the recipes from her

grandmother may have helped Mami to be able to speak about her mother, even

though it may still make her sad.


5. In what ways is Mami supporting Celeste, even though she works so much?


» Even though Mami works multiple jobs, she talks with Celeste, helps her cook, and

listens while Celeste shares her dreams with her.


6. Choose two or three words to describe the relationship between Celeste

and her mother. Tell your partner why you chose those words.


» Answers will vary but students should use textual evidence to support their word

selection.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to identify one way in which Celeste has changed in the
story so far.


 - When students are done, have them underline answers to the questions where

their answers differed. Remind students that their answers are valid, even if

they do not agree with their partners, as long as they have textual evidence

that supports their thinking.


 - Tell students that they will now move on to writing an opinion paragraph using

what they have learned about Celeste.

**Primary Focus:** Students will explain the author’s purpose and message in

Excerpt 11 from _Letters from Heaven._ ~~**[ TEKS 4.10.A ]**~~


~~**READING EXCERPT 11 (30 MIN.)**~~


 - Briefly review the events of Excerpt 10, in which Mami sees the letters



30m



Grandma wrote to Celeste for the first time. Have students use adjectives to

describe the mood of the scene.


 - Ask students how Grandma’s thinking about people wanting to help is related

to Celeste.


    - Answers will vary but may include Celeste is trying to figure out how

Grandma’s thoughts about people wanting to help could be related to her

own life.


    - Consider having students reread previous texts to locate this statement

from Grandma.


1. **Literal.** What else did Celeste’s Grandma believe about asking for and

giving help?


» Mami reminded Celeste that Grandma said it was easier to give help than to ask

for it.


**Note:** Explain to students that Excerpt 11, which students will read today,
picks up after Celeste finishes her snack and that she is still thinking about
the advice regarding help that Grandma gave Mami: “She’d say that it’s
harder to ask for help than to give it.” Allow students to discuss this quote
from Celeste’s grandmother at the beginning of this lesson.


 - Read aloud the first three paragraphs of Excerpt 11, stopping at “Am I

interrupting?”, as students follow along. Be sure students understand the

meaning of the word _mantra_ in this context—a word or phrase that serves as a

guide to action.


**TEKS 4.10.A** Explain the author’s purpose and message within a text.


Lesson 11 Discovering Author’s Purpose
**149**


Support


If students have trouble
summarizing, ask them
to identify which of these
statements about the text
are important:


- Celeste asks Miss Robyn
whether she can rejoin
the class. _(yes)_


  - Celeste offers to help
with the youngest
children at the studio.
_(yes)_


  - Celeste has to look up
Miss Robyn’s phone
number in a directory.
_(no)_


  - Miss Robyn accepts
Celeste’s offer of help.
_(yes)_



2. **Inferential.** Why do you think Celeste is calling her dance teacher? Be as

specific as possible.


» Answers will vary but may include that she wants to ask her for help, perhaps

by asking whether she can come back and dance even though her mother can’t

afford the fees.


» Consider asking students to make a prediction about her dance teacher, Miss

Robyn’s response. Students can talk with a partner to discuss their predictions.


3. **Inferential.** Why does the text say that Celeste’s voice “trembles a bit”?

What does that suggest about Celeste’s mood and emotions at this

moment?


» Answers will vary but may include that she is probably feeling anxious, nervous, or

shy.


- Have students read the rest of the excerpt silently.


- Remind students that in the past they have summarized excerpts—that is,

given a brief statement of what happens in the excerpts.


- Ask students to provide a summary of what happens in this excerpt, using

details from the text to build their ideas.


- Ask students to look back at the text and identify specific words or phrases in

the excerpt that show how Celeste is feeling. Tell students that these words or

phrases may be found in the dialogue or actions.


   - If needed, guide students to see that words like _well_ and _maybe_ in

Celeste’s dialogue and _timidly_ and _embarrassed_ in the action all provide a

window into Celeste’s state of mind.


    - She is anxious and self-conscious about this conversation. It is hard for

her to say what she wants to say.


- Ask readers how they can say the dialogue with expression and in a way that

shows the emotions of the characters, particularly those of Celeste. Have

students consider what they know about voice and tone.


- Point out that even though Celeste has the feelings noted in the text, she

continues to have the discussion and to ask for what she wants.


4. **Inferential.** How does Celeste feel at the beginning of the conversation

with Miss Robyn? How does she feel at the end? Use textual evidence to

support your thinking.


» Responses will vary but may include that at the beginning of the conversation,

Celeste feels shy, embarrassed, and self-conscious. At the end, she feels relieved.

All responses should be supported by textual evidence.



Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**150**


5. **Evaluative.** What lesson does Celeste learn during the course of the

conversation?


» Responses will vary, but may include that she learns that although she appeared

to be nervous about asking for help, Miss Robyn did want to help. Students may

elicit from the text that Celeste may be thinking that her grandmother was right

and most people really do want to help. Ask students to use their critical reading

skills (looking back at the text, making observations, citing details) to synthesize.


- Explain that authors write for a reason, which we call the author’s purpose _._


- Tell students that authors’ purposes may vary. Sometimes authors write to

entertain. Sometimes they write to convince or persuade. Sometimes they

write to inform or to teach.


- Tell students that authors may sometimes have more than one purpose in

mind. Tell students to keep this in mind when they are thinking about the

author’s purpose in _Letters from Heaven._


- Distribute students’ Activity Books and have them turn to Activity Page 11.1.

Have students read the instructions on their own.


**Note:** The following comes from Activity Page 11.1.


**Activity Page 11.1**


Author’s Purpose


- Authors have different purposes for writing that may include ideas, topics,

messages, or opinions they want to share with the reader through their

writing.


- Authors of fiction often use characters to support the purposes of their

writing, including the purposes to persuade, inform, or entertain.


- Think about your reading of _Letters from Heaven_ . Then answer the questions

below about the author’s purpose:


» Student answers may vary, but possible answers are given.


1. What do you think the author’s purpose is in _Letters from Heaven_ ? If you

think the author had more than one purpose, explain them all. Explain your

thoughts with evidence from the text.


» Student answers may vary, but ensure textual evidence is used to support

thinking.



Challenge


Ask students whether they
can think of other purposes
an author may have for
writing a certain text. _(to_
_make the audience laugh;_
_to scare the audience)_

_Heaven_ . ~~**[ TEKS 4.1.C; TEKS 4.11.A; TEKS 4.13.H ]**~~


~~**COMPARING AND CONTRASTING EXCERPTS (30 MIN.)**~~


 - Review Celeste’s statement in Excerpt 10: “And what if I don’t want help?

Nobody can help me with what I want: for Mami not to work so much and for

me to go back to dance class. I can take care of the rest myself. I don’t need to

go around begging people for help. That’s not me.”


 - Tell students to think about what happens in Excerpt 11 so they can answer the

following questions:


1. **Literal.** What did Celeste ask from her dance teacher?


» Answers may vary but could include that Celeste asks her dance teacher for help

by asking if she can take dance classes even if she can’t pay, she asks for the

chance to work for her dance teacher by helping in the kiddie class, etc.


2. **Evaluative.** Do you think Celeste is glad she asked? Provide evidence from

the text to support your position.


» Responses will vary, but should include that she is happy, relieved, or grateful.

Possible evidence includes: she says, “Thank you so much. You don’t know what

this means to me _,_ ” which shows that she is pleased to hear the answer.


 - Ask students whether there are situations in which Celeste could have, or

perhaps should have, asked for help but did not. You may want to make a list

on the board of students’ suggestions. Possible answers include:


    - Getting help from Silvia or another friend when Amanda was being unkind

to her


    - Asking for help from her teacher or the principal when there was a

disagreement with a friend

to Excerpt 11?


    - What makes the difference between Celeste’s statements in Excerpt 10,

when she says she will not ask for help, and her actions in Excerpt 11, when

she does ask for help?


     - Responses will vary, but could include that she thinks more about

what her grandmother always used to say to her and realizes that her

Grandma was right and/or decides to follow her advice.


 - Ask students what lesson they might draw from this difference. (Asking for

help can make life easier and possibly even make a person happier.)

the author’s purpose and message.


~~**TEKS 4.6.F; TEKS 4.7.E; TEKS 4.8.B; TEKS 4.10.A**~~


~~**ANALYZING AUTHOR’S PURPOSE AND MESSAGE (30 MIN.)**~~


 - Review with students the events of Excerpt 11, “Asking for Help, Part 2,” in

which Celeste arranges to go back to dance class in exchange for helping with

the kiddie class.


 - Tell students that there are two significant mysteries still unresolved in the

story: how many more letters Celeste will receive from her grandmother, and

who has been sending the letters. Tell students that one of these mysteries will

be resolved in this excerpt, but the other will remain a mystery.


 - Have students look at the title of Excerpt 12, “Flan.” Ask if any students are

familiar with this food. You may need to explain that flan is a sweet dessert

made out of custard with caramel glaze that is popular in Cuba, among other

countries.


 - Read aloud the salutation and the first paragraph of the grandmother’s letter

while students follow along.


1. **Inferential.** Based on the evidence in this letter, do you think this is likely to

be the last letter, or will others follow? Explain your thinking.


» Answers will vary, but may include that this is likely to be the last letter; Grandma

says “I’m running out of time” and “This is how I want to say goodbye to you.”


2. **Evaluative.** How do you think Celeste will feel after reading the rest of this

letter? Be as specific as you can.


» Answers will vary. Possible answers include _sad_ and _grateful,_ or that she will have

mixed emotions.


 - Point out the sentence that begins “That is how my life has been…” Read the

list of flavors aloud, one by one ( _sweet, bitter_, etc.), and have students raise

their hands if they would use these words to describe any part of their lives.


**TEKS 4.6.F** Make inferences and use evidence to support understanding; **TEKS 4.7.E** Interact with sources in meaningful
ways such as notetaking, annotating, freewriting, or illustrating; **TEKS 4.8.B** Explain the interactions of the characters and
the changes they undergo; **TEKS 4.10.A** Explain the author’s purpose and message within a text.


Lesson 12 Uncovering Author’s Messages
**161**


Support


If students have trouble
answering any of these
questions, point out the
paragraph or sentence in
which the answer appears.


Challenge


Ask students to write a
paragraph describing the
final scene of the excerpt
from Mami’s point of view.




- Have students read the rest of the excerpt on their own. You may need to

remind them that _cielo_ is a term of endearment in Spanish and that Celeste’s

mother has called Celeste _cielo_ in earlier excerpts.


- When students are finished, have them answer the following questions for

comprehension:


3. **Literal.** Why does Grandma say she saved the flan recipe for last?


» Flan is a sweet dessert, and Grandma wants to leave Celeste with the memory of

something sweet to represent the sweetness of the memories Grandma has of

Celeste and her mother.


4. **Literal.** How does Grandma suggest that Celeste serve the flan?


» She says it should be served on fine plates with a tablecloth and flowers.


5. **Literal.** What does Celeste say these foods all have in common?


» They are all a part of a complete dinner, including an appetizer, main course, side

dishes, and dessert.


6. **Literal.** What do Celeste and her mother decide to do with these recipes?


» They plan to use the recipes Grandma sent to make dinner and invite their friends.


7. **Evaluative** . What do you think Celeste’s Grandma means when she says

“Everything good takes time”?


» Answers will vary but students may make a connection with the time that it is

taking to discover who is writing the letters or to the idea that developing new

skills and getting “good” at something takes time and practice.


- Remind students that in the previous lesson they discussed the author’s

purpose, or the author’s reasons for writing the story. Remind students that

authors can have more than one purpose, and there can be more than one

message they are trying to convey.


   - Have students review and discuss what they thought about the author’s

purpose, and what messages the author may be trying to convey. If

students need assistance, suggest one message the author may intend for

her readers that involves asking for help, and that people are often willing

to help when they can.


- Remind students that there were two unsolved mysteries in the text before

this excerpt. Ask which mystery has been solved (the mystery of how many

letters are still to come) and how it was resolved (this is in fact the last letter

Celeste is to receive).



Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven
**162**


- Ask students to speculate about why the author waited until near the end of

the story to let the reader know that this is the last letter.


» Answers will vary. Possible answers include that Celeste doesn’t know when the

last letter will arrive, so it is reasonable that the reader doesn’t know either; not

knowing the answer to this question makes the reader want to keep reading or

remain in suspense.


- Ask students to think about why the author has not yet revealed how Celeste

is receiving the letters and discuss.


» Answers will vary. Possible responses include that it is fun to be kept in suspense

or that it is fun for the reader to keep speculating or guessing who is sending the

letters.


   - Invite students to predict again who is responsible for getting the letters

to Celeste. Record their answers using a bar graph, tally marks, or another

method to show the class’ responses. Keep this as a record so students

can check their predictions when they find the answer in Excerpt 13. If

time permits, have students explain their reasons behind their predictions,

looking back at the text to make observations and cite details.


- Return to the topic of author’s purpose and message. Have students open

their Activity Books to Activity Page 12.1. Ask them to read the directions on

their own. Then have them answer the questions.


**Note:** The following comes from Activity Page 12.1.


**Activity Page 12.1**


Author’s Message


Answer these questions. Think about the messages the author wants the
reader to understand.


- Possible answers are given.


1. In Excerpt 12, what messages do you think the author wants the reader to

understand? Be as specific as possible and use evidence from the text to

support your answer.


» Answers may vary, but one possible response is that the author wants the reader

to understand that family memories are important and that family memories can

be closely related to food and one’s culture.

**Primary Focus:** Students will write a descriptive paragraph about their favorite

food or meal. ~~**[ TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.12.A; TEKS 4.13.H ]**~~


~~**WRITING A DESCRIPTIVE PARAGRAPH (30 MIN.)**~~


 - Allow students to give a thumbs up if they think food was important to the plot

of _Letters from Heaven_ .


 - Allow students to give a thumbs down if they think food was not important to

the plot of _Letters from Heaven_ .


 - Tell the students that the final excerpt of _Letters from Heaven,_ Excerpt 13,

“Family Dinner,” includes a meal made up of all the recipes Celeste’s

grandmother sent her.


 - The author uses many descriptive words and phrases to bring the meal to life.


 - Ask students why descriptive words are important to a writer, like the author

of _Letters from Heaven_, Lydia Gil.


    - Answers will vary but students should understand that descriptive words

allow the reader to connect with characters’ experiences. Lydia Gil and

other writers use descriptive language to help the readers create mental

images while reading.


 - Have students listen to these quotes from Excerpts 1 and 13, and instruct them

to listen specifically for descriptive details:


    - Excerpt 1: _The day feels like it’s never going to end. Math, Science, English,_

_Social Studies, it all blurs together in my head and the only thing I can think_

_about is my grandmother’s green dress._


    - Excerpt 13: _The table is set with candles, red carnations and a yellow_

_tablecloth. We decorate every napkin with a sprig of rosemary, like_

_Grandma used to do for special occasions._


 - Allow student volunteers to share the descriptions included in each line that

help them create a mental image.

                 - Explain to the students that to apply their learning about descriptive language

during their own narratives in this unit, they will be writing a separate

descriptive paragraph about a meal that is special to them.


                 - Ask students to consider details such as the interactions or dialogue of people

involved in preparing or eating the meal, where the meal takes place, and

memories they have associated with the meal.


                 - Tell students that as they recall what makes the meal special, they should

think about descriptive details, such as sensory details, figurative language, or

actions they can include to make the meal come alive for their readers and will

help them connect to the experience.


                 - Remind students to include descriptive details that describe the food, people

involved, where the meal takes place, and other special memories associated

with it in their paragraphs.


                 - Direct students to write their paragraph on lined paper. Tell students that if

they have extra time, they should edit their work using their editing checklist

###### Pausing Point


~~**PAUSING POINT FOR DIFFERENTIATION OF INSTRUCTION**~~


Please use two days to address students’ performance in this unit.
We recommend the first Pausing Point either after Lesson 6 or Lesson 12,
and the second Pausing Point day after Lesson 13, but you should insert
these days to best support your class. Use your observations of student
performance in class and completion of activity pages to informally evaluate
student strengths and weaknesses and determine which remediation and/or
enrichment opportunities will benefit particular students. In assigning these
remediation and/or enrichment activities, you may choose to have students
work individually, in small groups, or as a whole class.


~~**REMEDIATION**~~


For a detailed description of remediation strategies, which address lagging
skills in Reading Comprehension, Fluency, Language, and Writing, refer to the
Program Guide.


**Content**


If students demonstrate a need for remediation on any of the elements of
the Contemporary Fiction unit, refer to the lessons covering that element.
You may wish to read any excerpt again as a teacher Read-Aloud. In addition,
you should focus on the suggestions labeled “Support” in the Teacher Guide
materials for that lesson.


~~**ENRICHMENT**~~


**Continuing to Work on Personal Narratives**


Our suggestion for the Pausing Point days is for students to concentrate on
refining and revising their stories. This is an opportunity for you to spend
time with individual students, reading their work and providing targeted
feedback.


By the time they reach the Pausing Point, students should have created
rough drafts of their personal narratives


Unit 3 Contemporary Fiction: Letters from Heaven


You may wish to use the following tools to help students work on their
narratives:


**Personal Narrative 1**

  - Ask students to use the organizer below.


**Note:** The following content is from Activity Page PP.1.


**Activity Page PP.1**


Revise the order of events of your personal narrative using the graphic
organizer below. Fill in what has happened in your story so far in the first
squares, the last squares, and the squares in the middle. Think about what
might have happened in between. Revise what happens in the beginning, the
middle, or the end if you think it no longer makes sense.


Pausing Point
**183**


**184**



~~**PERSONAL NARRATIVE 2**~~


 - Ask students to choose their favorite secondary character, reread the
excerpt(s) that features that character, and use it to create a new scene in
their personal narrative.


**Note:** The following content is from Writer’s Journal PP.2.


**Activity Page PP.2**


Complete the lines below, and then use the space here or at the back of your
Activity Page to create a new scene for your personal narrative.

**Story Arcs**


As an alternative enrichment for the second Pausing Point lesson, you may
wish to return to the excerpt “Family Dinner,” which students first read in the
Unit Assessment. This excerpt provides a story arc, a concept students have
not investigated in this unit.


  - Explain that some stories can be analyzed through a story arc. Tell students
that often stories don’t fit neatly into this structure but that it can still be
useful to help a reader understand what is going on.


Pausing Point
**185**


**186**




 - Explain that sometimes individual chapters, as well as complete stories,
fit into this structure. Tell students they will look at “Family Dinner” as an
example.


 - Spend 10 minutes reviewing the story arcs using the graphic organizer on
Activity Page PP.4 as a guide. Explain each term and model on the board/
chart paper, using the story “Little Red Riding Hood.” There are many
versions of “Little Red Riding Hood”—you may wish to adapt this to your
favorite:


1. **Evaluative.** Introduction/Beginning. Usually this introduces the characters

and the setting. What is the beginning of “Little Red Riding Hood”?


» We meet Red Riding Hood and find out she has a grandmother she wishes to visit

in the woods.


2. **Evaluative.** Rising Action. This is where events build, grabbing your

attention and leading you to the climax of the story. What is the rising

action of this story?


» Red Riding Hood is in the woods, and a wolf is following her. The wolf races ahead

and eats her grandmother.


3. **Evaluative.** The Climax. This is the turning point—the most dramatic

moment of the story. What is the climax of this story?


» Red Riding Hood meets the wolf. She realizes something is wrong and the wolf

eats her (or tries to eat her, depending on which version you read).


4. **Evaluative.** Falling Action. These are the events that happen as a result of

the climax. What is the falling action of this story?


» The woodsman hears the events and rushes in, saving Red Riding Hood and the

grandmother.


5. **Evaluative.** Resolution. The story ends, and everything is resolved. What is

the falling action of this story?


» The wolf is dead. Red Riding Hood and the grandmother live happily ever after.


 - Ask students to complete the arc with the excerpt “Family Dinner” and then

~~**EMBEDDING THE EDITING PROCESS**~~


Revising and editing can be challenging for students. It may be helpful to follow

the steps below to help your students as they revise and edit their own work.


This process can be done at the sentence level, in addition to extended written

pieces. By using students’ quick writes and shorter responses, instructional

time can be maximized and the writing process will be authentic to what

students are composing.


**Steps for Successful Editing**


1. Model the editing process during writing instruction and target a single skill at

a time.


2. Select a text with errors to provide guided practice in small groups.


3. Partner or pair students for collaborative practice using pre-selected texts

with errors.


4. Provide opportunities for students to practice independently by editing their

own work or the work of a peer.


5. Conference with students in small groups or individually to provide corrective

and informative feedback.


6. Repeat the process by modeling a new grammar or convention skill.


**Last, but not least...**

- Start with single sentences before moving onto longer pieces of writing.


- Explicit grammar lessons can be reinforced using a variety of texts. Use

sentences from Read-Aloud or Student Reader texts to use as mentor

sentences.


- Have students apply their understanding of a targeted skill in their short and

extended constructed responses.


- Provide rehearsal opportunities during collaborative and independent writing

time.


- Grammar is best taught in the context of student writing.


- Incorporate spelling practice including use of high frequency words in written

compositions.

|TEKS|Description<br>of Skill|Sample Activity|
|---|---|---|
|4.11.D.i|complete, simple, and<br>compound sentences<br>with subject-verb<br>agreement and<br>avoidance of splices,<br>run-on, and fragments|Begin by focusing on simple sentences before moving onto<br>compound sentences. Take one skill at a time (i.e., subject-verb<br>agreement) and provide students with pre-selected text with those<br>errors. Once students are ready, move onto compound sentences.<br>Repeat the process with splices, run-ons, and fragments.  Have<br>students engage in peer editing or independent editing. This can<br>also be achieved by using student-generated work.|
|4.11.D.ii|past tense of irregular<br>verbs|Model writing sentences in shared writing activities to<br>demonstrate the correct usage. Hold students accountable for this<br>skill in their own writing and have students routinely edit for the<br>past tense of irregular verbs in their own writing or that of a peer.|
|4.11.D.iii|singular, plural,<br>common, and proper<br>nouns|In cooperative groups of 3-4, students will use a draft they are<br>currently working on to edit for a specific noun type. Set a timer<br>and have students pass their paper clockwise to the person<br>next to them. First round, highlight the nouns (plural) in the<br>text. Second round, underline sentences that have errors in<br>the noun’s usage. Third round, suggest an edit for the correct<br>usage. Fourth round, student agrees/disagrees with the edit and<br>makes necessary changes.|
|4.11.D.iv|adjectives, including<br>their comparative and<br>superlative forms|Provide short passages with errors in the usage of comparative<br>or superlative adjectives. Have students rewrite the sentence<br>to correct errors. This can be done as an independent activity,<br>or warm-up to open the writing lesson. Have students share out<br>their corrected sentence with the class for comparison.|
|4.11.D.v|adverbs that convey<br>frequency and adverbs<br>that convey degree|Target common errors in adverb usage such as<br>• Incorrect placement of adverbs (e.g., “She quickly ran”<br>instead of “She ran quickly”).<br>• Overuse or misuse of adverbs (e.g., redundant adverbs like<br>“very quickly”).<br>• Missing adverbs where clarification or emphasis is needed.<br>Model the correct usage of adverbs during writing instruction<br>and encourage students to use adverbs in written responses.<br>Collect responses and use one of the student’s written pieces to<br>edit as a class.|
|4.11.D.vi|prepositions and<br>prepositional phrases|Common errors include:<br>• Incorrect preposition usage (e.g., “She is in the home”<br>instead of “She is at home”).<br>• Incorrect prepositional phrase placement or structure.<br>• Missing or unnecessary prepositions.<br>After teaching students about the function and use of<br>preposition and prepositional phrases, have them notice them<br>in the texts they are reading. As editing practice, have students<br>take turns reading their written piece aloud to a partner.<br>The partner will listen for the incorrect usage and, together,<br>students can edit the sentence to make it correct.|
|4.11.D.vii|pronouns, including<br>reflexive|Provide sentences with subject-object relationships or with<br>multiple instances of reflexive pronouns. Engage students in<br>a class discussion about the errors and how to correct them.<br>Provide students with opportunities to edit their own pieces for<br>the correct usage of reflexive pronouns.|



Pausing Point
**189**


|4.11.D.viii|coordinating<br>conjunctions to form<br>compound subjects,<br>predicates, and<br>sentences|Provide students with stems that have different coordinating<br>conjunctions. For example, Cooking is rewarding because…<br>Cooking is rewarding, but…Cooking is rewarding, so… This is<br>a fun activity to tie to content students are currently learning<br>about because it can serve as a check for understanding for<br>comprehension. Students can edit their sentences after writing<br>them. Editing for coordinating conjunctions is appropriate to do<br>during revision when students are adding or rearranging their<br>details for clarity and coherence.|
|---|---|---|
|4.11.D.ix|capitalization of<br>historical periods, events<br>and documents; titles<br>of books; stories and<br>essays; and languages,<br>races, and nationalities|Use lessons and activities provided in the product for<br>capitalizing historical periods, events, documents, titles, stories,<br>essays, and languages, races, and nationalities. Also, use pre-<br>selected texts that target a specific capitalization skill and then<br>add this specificity to your editing checklist.|
|4.11.D.x|punctuation marks<br>including apostrophes<br>in possessives,<br>commas in compound<br>sentences, and<br>quotation marks in<br>dialogue|Refer to specific lessons that address punctuation marks and<br>ensure students have an opportunity to edit for apostrophes<br>in possessives, as this is a challenging skill, especially when<br>working with plurals. Dialogue is also a bit tricky, so providing<br>students with mentor sentences for punctuation is helpful.<br>As always, have students use writing that they are currently<br>working on to edit for this skill.|
|4.11.D.xi|correct spelling<br>of words with<br>grade appropriate<br>orthographic patterns<br>and rules and high-<br>frequency words|Incorporate editing for correct spelling using skills that are<br>presented in the spelling lessons for each unit. After a pattern<br>has been addressed, draw students’ attention to that pattern<br>and include that as a part of the “editing for spelling” in the<br>editing checklist. For example, if students are working with<br>multisyllabic words with final stable syllables (generation, etc.),<br>then the editing for spelling target can be that particular skill.<br>Continually bring students’ attention to the high frequency<br>words they encounter in texts.|
