##### Introduction

The American poet Emily Dickinson, who lived in the 1800s, once compared
poetry to possibility, and that seems like a good comparison, because poetry
uses a set of tools called figurative language to show how words can mean many
different things, depending on how you use them. Poets write about all sorts of
subjects, from how they feel to what they believe, from questions they have to
their dreams for themselves and the world. In this unit, you will study poems
written by people from different countries and time periods. You’ll learn how
to read poems aloud and how to figure out what possibilities each poem holds.
You’ll also learn how to recognize the tools poets use and to use them in poems
of your own. We hope you’ll enjoy learning all about these possibilities!


Now let’s get started!

Poets use repetition for different reasons. Sometimes they want to stress an important thought or point.
Sometimes they want to repeat certain letters or sounds, as in rhyming words, to make their poem sound
pleasing.


4. Once you have completed the previous chart, use the words on each line to form a sentence. Try to
make each one a sentence that you find interesting. You may revise the chart if you wish. Write your
sentences on the lines below.

###### 2.1



There are many ways to write a poem, and poets have to make choices about the way they want their poems
to look and sound. They have to make decisions about content—the poem’s message—and form—the poem’s
structure or appearance.

When considering a poem’s form, poets have to decide:

  - how many stanzas, or groups of lines, the poem will have

  - how many lines each stanza will have

  - whether or not the poem will include a rhyme scheme

When considering a poem’s content, poets have to decide:

  - what their poem will be about (the poem’s subject or content)

  - what message they want to present about their subject (For example, they might want to describe their
subject, or make a claim about it, or tell a story about it. The poems we are reading in this unit all tell
stories about a subject.)

  - what angle or perspective they want to take on their subject, or who the poem’s narrator will be (This is
often referred to as _point of view._ )

First-person point of view is used when speakers or narrators describe stories or events that include them as
characters. It often includes words such as _I_, _me_, _my_, _we_, or _us_ .

For example, a student named Lauren might say:

_One time I dreamed I could fly._

This would be first-person, since Lauren is talking about her own experience. Lauren is a character in the
sentence she narrates.


Third-person point of view is used when speakers or narrators describe stories or events that do not include
them as characters. It often uses words such as _he_, _she_, _it_, or _they_ .

For example, Lauren’s classmate José might describe Lauren’s dream:

_Once, Lauren dreamed she could fly._

This would be third-person, since José is talking about someone else’s experience. José is not a character in the
sentence he narrates.


Here’s an example of how José might make his sentence first-person:

_Lauren told me that, once, she dreamed she could fly._

This sentence is in first-person, since José is a character describing an event from his perspective.

1. Emily dreamed of going on a trip to India with
her uncle.


2. I dreamed about riding a racehorse.


3. My little brother dreamed of being president after he went to Washington, D.C.


4. Austin had a dream about being a Major League baseball player.


5. Sofia’s mother had dreamed for years about opening
a restaurant.


6. In the dream, the friendly dragon offered to let us ride on his back.


7. After hearing the astronaut speak, our class dreamed of going to Mars someday.


8. Write a first-person sentence about a dream you have had while sleeping.

Now that you’ve read and thought about Nikki Giovanni’s poem, it’s time to imagine what her library looked
like. To do that, you will think about all the details in the poem, then draw them in the space on the next page.


1. Look back at the poem and underline any words that help describe what the library looked like.


2. For each item you underlined, think about how to draw that. Use the details from the poem to help you. For
example, does Giovanni remember that some objects were big? Does she tell you the shape of the furniture?
Think about how these details can help you imagine what the room looked like.


3. Take one description and draw it in the space below. Make sure to think about where in the space it should be
located.


4. The narrator describes the entrance of the library, “In the foyer up four steps a semi-circle desk _presided_ .”
_Presided_ means to watch over or be in charge of something. What figurative language is this an example of?
What does it make you imagine?


5. As you draw each thing, label it with a word from the poem that helped you imagine how to draw it.


6. Keep adding objects to your library until it looks like the one in the poem.


If you feel stuck while you work, make sure to consult the poem, as it will help you know where to put each
image. If you finish with time remaining, reread the poem. Look for one more detail you could draw in your
library.

Today’s lesson included Nikki Giovanni’s poem “My First Memory (of Librarians),” a poem in which the
narrator remembers an event from her childhood and describes it with lots of detail. In this exercise, you’ll
think about a memory of your own, then answer some questions. If you don’t finish during class time, you may
complete your work at home.


1. Think about your favorite place. It might be a place where you go often, or it could be a place you have only
been once. When you have thought of the place and remembered visiting it, write down the name of the place
below.


2. Think about what you did in this place. Did you talk to anyone? Move around? Do anything? Touch any
objects? Leave anything there or take anything when you left? Using the lines marked “2a” through “2d,” write
down four different things you did in this place.


2a. ____________________________________________________________________


2b. ____________________________________________________________________


2c. ____________________________________________________________________


2d. ____________________________________________________________________

3. Visualize! Now think about what the place looked like. What colors do you remember seeing? What objects
were there? Were there other people? What did they look like? What were they wearing? Using the lines
below, write down four details that describe how the place looked.


3a. ____________________________________________________________________


3b. ____________________________________________________________________


3c. ____________________________________________________________________


3d. ____________________________________________________________________


4. Now use your ears! Think about the sounds you heard in this place. Did anyone talk to you? What did they
say? Was music playing? Were there other noises, or was it very quiet? Remember that, even in quiet places,
you can hear some noises—perhaps you heard your own breathing, or the wind, or the air conditioner. Using
the lines below, write down at least four sounds you heard in this place.


4a. ____________________________________________________________________


4b. ____________________________________________________________________


4c. ____________________________________________________________________


4d. ____________________________________________________________________

feels, how the place smells, or any other special detail that you remember and want to include.


5a. ____________________________________________________________________


5b. ____________________________________________________________________


5c. ____________________________________________________________________


5d. ____________________________________________________________________


If you’ve answered all the questions, that’s great! If you haven’t, remember that care matters more than speed.


Later in the poetry units you’ll use this exercise as the starting point for a poem about your memory. To write
a strong poem, you’ll need to have lots of information, so make sure this is as complete as possible. If you
remember other details later, you should add them. Think of all the details Giovanni used to help make her
description memorable; try to do the same in your own work.

**Figurative Language in Poetry**

**Part 1**



Activity Page
###### 3.1



One way to start understanding poetry is to understand the different kinds of language poets use.

One thing that helps distinguish poetry from other forms of writing is its use of language. Often when we hear a
word, we think of its dictionary definition. We call that its _literal_ meaning.

Example: Hand me that pen so I can sign Liam’s birthday card

In this sentence the speaker is asking for an actual, literal pen, which we use for writing. However, sometimes
we mean something slightly different from the literal meaning.

Example: The pen is mightier than the sword.

When people say this, they do not literally mean that in a duel, the person holding a pen would beat the
person holding a sword. What they mean is that words are often stronger than acts of violence. When people
speak this way, they are using something called _figurative_ _language_ . A word’s figurative meaning might be a
symbol or representative of something else. The key is that the figurative meaning contains ideas, emotions, or
connections that differ from the dictionary definition.

Although all writers may use the tools of figurative language, it appears in poetry more frequently than in other
kinds of writing.

**Developing Memory Poems**



Activity Page
###### 3.3



In the lesson on Nikki Giovanni’s “My First Memory (of Librarians),” you started writing about a memory of your own and
the setting where it took place. “Harlem” shows another way that poets can write about places they find meaningful. Today
you’ll review your work and add some details and ideas to help improve it. We call this process _revision_, which is making
changes to improve something.

First, read over your notes on Poet’s Journal 2.5. You will also see that your teacher has left you some comments about additional details you might add to your notes. If you have any questions about your teacher’s comments, raise your hand to get
help. Once you understand your teacher’s comments, think about how you might do what your teacher suggests to improve
your work.

Write down any changes you might make based on your teacher’s comments.

Once you have listed your changes, think about how Langston Hughes, Nikki Giovanni, and other poets you’ve read write
about places that are important to them. Answer the following questions to help you think about ways to show why your
memory is so important to you.


1. In one sentence, describe the most important thing that happens in
your memory.


2. How did you feel when this happened?

Now that you’ve planned and revised your ideas, it’s time to draft your memory poem! As you work, you should
consult the description of your memory that you prepared with Poet’s Journal 2.5 and 3.3 (Lesson 2). Use these
materials as you answer the following questions:


1. In one sentence, write the topic of your memory.


2. In revision, you developed a simile to show readers how you felt in this memory. Copy that simile here.


3. Pick one important word that you want to stress as a way of showing your poem’s tone. Write that word here.


4. How will you emphasize the word you picked in question 3?
Circle your answer.


I will emphasize it through repetition.


I will emphasize it by putting it right before a line break.


I will emphasize it by using repetition and by putting it right before a line break.

about your memory, but you might not need all those details in your poem. Narrow your ideas down to the
three most important details about your memory, and write them here. Next to each detail, write why this
detail will be so important to your poem.


A.

responses to the questions below.

When it is your turn to read your work aloud, remember to speak clearly and slowly.
When it is your turn to listen to your partner, think about the following questions as you listen to the poem.
Take a minute to write down your answers and share them aloud with your partner.
Remember that you should listen attentively to your partner. This means you should think about what your
partner is reading so that you are able to review the key ideas your partner expresses in his or her poem. Make
sure to look at your partner while he or she reads the poem aloud.


1. Using your own words, describe the main thing that happens in your partner’s poem.


2. The previous lesson asked you to emphasize a word or phrase in your poem. What word or phrase seems to
be emphasized in your partner’s poem? You may look at the written poem as you think about your answer;
make sure to give a reason for your answer.

**Understanding Metaphor**

Up to now, the poems in this unit have used figurative language in clear ways.



Activity Page
###### 4.2



However, poets do not always make their comparisons so directly. As readers, one of the things we must figure
out is whether or not Whitman is referring to literal songs that people would sing out loud, if he is using the
idea of singing as a metaphor, or if he is doing both.

Consult the poem as needed to answer the following questions about how Whitman uses metaphor.


1. At the end of the poem, Whitman writes, “Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else.” Using
your own words, explain what Whitman means here.


2. Whitman makes sure to explain that the singers are all doing some kind of work. Here, he is probably not
saying that everyone is singing at their jobs! Instead, he seems to compare work to singing. Write down ways
that each of the following kinds of work might be like singing.


A. Shoemaking: _________________________________________________________________________

B. Plowing a field: _______________________________________________________________________

important trait about America? Give a reason from the poem to support your answer.


6. _Harmony_ is a musical term that describes how different notes work together to create a pleasing sound. It also
describes how people work together. How does Whitman’s metaphor between singing and work use the two

**Planning Anaphora Poems**

**Planning**



Name:


Date:



In writing, it is important to think about what you want to accomplish before you begin. This exercise will help
you do that. You will write one stanza during this lesson. You may choose to continue adding to this poem on
your own. First consider what you are going to write: a poem that uses anaphora to describe different aspects of
your own personality.

Think about how Momaday does this: He uses nature and the environment as representatives of what it means
to be alive.

1. Think about your own life and the things that are most important to you. What elements of nature will you
use as a metaphor to represent different parts of your life or identity in the lines of your anaphora poem?

2. Think about the way Momaday uses anaphora. Start each line of your poem by saying “I am ____.”


**Organizing**

Now that you have an idea of how you will include anaphora, you need to develop ideas about how to organize
the different characteristics. In this exercise, you’ll use natural elements just as Momaday did. Think about how
you can use ideas that describe your personality, what you do, and how you feel as a strategy for drafting your
poem. Follow the prompts below to list the parts of your life or identity that you will write about in the poem.

3. Momaday’s first stanza uses elements of nature. List at least two features of nature that are metaphors for your
personality. For example, if you are stubborn, you might describe yourself as a boulder or mountains, because
these are not easily moved.

4. Momaday’s first stanza describes actions in the natural world. List at least two actions you see in nature that
describe what you do. Like Momaday, you may use figurative language here. For example, if you
are someone who is always moving, you might write “I am the crashing of waves.”

5. Momaday and other poets often use feelings to guide their metaphors. List an element of nature that
represents your feelings. For example, if you are often joyful, you might write, “I am the rainbow after it
storms.”

If you finish this section with time remaining, go back and try to add two more nature metaphors to each of
your lists. For example, for question 3, you would add two more nature metaphors for your personality; for
question 4, you would add two more nature metaphors for what you do; and for question 5, you would add two
more nature metaphors for how
you feel. All of these should be representative of your life, personality,
or identity.


**Planning Checklist.**

1. Think about elements of nature that could represent your identity.

2. Start each line with “I am.”

3. List nature metaphors for your personality.

4. List actions in nature that describe you.

5. List an element of nature that represents your feelings.

**Alliteration**



Activity Page
###### 7.1



In this exercise you’ll practice your alliteration skills. In an earlier lesson you used alliteration to describe the
way an animal might feel. In this lesson you’ll write new examples of alliteration that link to your own name.

Write a letter from your name on each of the five lines on the next page. Only use each letter one time. If you
run out of letters from your first name, move on to your last name. For example, if your name were Sid Sawyer,
you would write the following letters on the lines: S, I, D, A, W.

After you put a letter on each line, write a sentence using each letter. Each sentence should have at least three
words that start with the letter from your name.


Examples:

Letter: _S_

_Shea spied swans._

Letter: _W_

_Wally watched walruses._

**Writing with All Five Senses**



Activity Page
###### 7.3



Now it’s your turn to write using all five senses and alliteration! In this activity you will follow Mora’s example
and write a poem about something that is extremely important to you. Follow the instructions below to plan,
organize, and draft your poem.


1. Mora writes about words because she values them. In this poem you will write about something that is
very important to you. Take a minute to think about an object that you value. It may not be something you
actually own, but it should be something you know well enough to describe in a lot of different ways. When
you have decided on the object you will write about, write it below.


2. Mora’s poem uses all five senses to describe words. You will do the same thing in your poem. For each letter
below, describe how the sense listed applies to your object. Depending on the object you selected, you may
not be able to give a literal meaning for each sense. For example, if you selected a favorite rock to write about,
you have probably never tasted it! But think about how Mora uses similes to introduce a figurative meaning
into her descriptions. Try to do the same with your object.


A. What does it feel like when you touch it?

When a writer’s metaphor continues for more than one sentence of a story or more than one line of a poem, it is
called an extended metaphor.

Carl Sandburg’s poem “Fog” uses an extended metaphor to compare the fog to a cat. Using the poem as a
reference, complete the following chart to show the different parts of Sandburg’s extended metaphor.

**Writing Poems with Extended Metaphors**

Now that you have seen how Carl Sandburg uses an extended metaphor to describe the weather, it’s your turn!
Follow the steps below to write your own poem that contains an extended metaphor comparing the weather to
an animal.


1. Read the words in the word bank below and pick the kind of weather you want to describe in your poem.
Circle your choice.

breeze hail lightning


clouds gust rain


downpour hurricane rainbow


snow sunshine thunder


tornado wind earthquake


2. Write down at least five different things that describe the word you circled above. If you get stuck for ideas,
you might think about what this kind of weather looks, sounds, or feels like. You might think about its shape,
color, and way of moving.

**Summarizing a Stanza**



Name:

Working with the group your teacher assigned, follow these steps to figure out the meaning of your stanza.


1. Read the stanza silently.


2. Have one member of the group read the stanza aloud.


3. If the stanza has any words you do not know, ask your group members for help. You might look in the
glossary to see if the word is defined. If not, work together as a group to think about how context clues can
help you infer the word’s meaning.


4. Go through each of the stanza’s four lines and talk about what they mean.


5. Once you agree on a meaning for each line, summarize those into the action of the stanza. Remember that in a
summary, you should describe the most important things happening. You should not include every detail, but
you should give readers a sense of the basic points of the section.


6. When you have agreed on a summary, write it here.


7. Pick one group representative to share the summary with the class when the teacher calls on your group.

**Poetic Devices**



Activity Page
###### 9.3



Now it’s time to explore the way this poem uses poetic devices. To do this, you will need to use things you
learned from other lessons in the poetry unit. Think back to the different kinds of poetic devices you have
learned about so far. Thayer uses a lot of them in his long poem!

Answer the following questions, consulting the poem as needed, to think more about which devices he used and
why he chose them.


1. In stanzas 1 and 2, the phrases “sickly silence” and “deep despair” are examples of which poetic device?


2. This device often adds emphasis to certain details. Look back at the first two stanzas of “Casey at the Bat.”
Why might the “sickly silence” and “deep despair” be important things to emphasize here?


3. Stanza 4 describes how Blake “tore the cover off the ball.” The poet uses figurative language here; Blake did
not really tear up the ball. What is the figurative meaning of this statement?

. . . there went up a muffled roar,
Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore.

Read each word carefully. What poetic device is used here? Name the word that helps you know this.


5. The lines in question 4 compare two different things. What are they?


6. How are the two things compared by the lines in question 4 similar?


7. Stanza 13 repeats the word “somewhere” many times. Circle the word every time it appears in the stanza.
How many times does it appear?


8. We know that poets often use repetition to focus on important details. Why might the author of this poem
want to focus on “somewhere” in this stanza?

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow


So through the night rode Paul Revere;


And so through the night went his cry of alarm


To every Middlesex village and farm,—


A cry of defiance, and not of fear,


A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,


And a word that shall echo forevermore!


For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,


Through all our history, to the last,


In the hour of darkness and peril and need,


The people will waken and listen to hear


The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,


And the midnight message of Paul Revere.
