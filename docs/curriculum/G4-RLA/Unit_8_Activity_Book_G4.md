**Excerpt from “Earth’s Layers and Moving Plates”**

_Read the following excerpt and use it to label Earth’s layers in the diagram that follows._


Earth’s deepest layer is a solid inner core of very hot metal. This metal may

be nearly as hot as the sun’s surface. The outer core is also made of hot metal, but

it’s liquid, not solid. The mantle surrounds the outer core. The mantle is Earth’s

largest and thickest layer and consists of very hot, very dense rock. The rock is

solid in the lower and upper parts of the mantle. In between, however, is a region

where the rock is partially melted, forming a solid and liquid mixure. The slow

movement and behavior of this material, caused by heat and pressure, have an

impact on Earth’s surface. Above the mantle is Earth’s outermost layer, the thin,

rocky crust. There are two types of crust: oceanic crust and continental crust.

Oceanic crust is covered by ocean water. Most of the continental crust is dry

land, but some of the crust around the edges is covered by water. Oceanic crust is

thinner but heavier than continental crust.

**Earth’s Forces at Work in Japan**

1 Japan shakes when Namazu wiggles his tail. That is the explanation for earthquakes
in some of Japan’s most famous myths. Namazu is a giant catfish whose nickname is
Earth-shaker. The Japanese mythical god Kashima tries to keep Namazu quiet. He
holds the catfish down under a large stone. Every now and then, however, Kashima
gets tired. The stone slips. Namazu swishes his great tail and causes an earthquake.


2 Japan has a long history of earthquakes but a mythical catfish isn’t what causes them.
If you look at a picture of Earth’s tectonic plates, you’ll see that several tectonic
plates come together in the Pacific Ocean near Japan. Some of the plates are sliding,
or subducting, under others. These moving plates release tremendous amounts of
energy as they grind past each other. Each burst of energy generates seismic waves
that spread through Earth’s crust. Seismic waves cause the ground to shake, creating
an earthquake. Plate movements trigger hundreds, even thousands, of earthquakes in
Japan every year.


3 Fortunately, most of these earthquakes are small. You might not even notice the
slight shaking of the ground they produce. Every so often, however, Japan is hit by
large earthquakes that cause terrible damage. In the past hundred years or so, Japan
has experienced three major earthquakes. An earthquake that registered 7.9 on the
Richter scale struck in 1923. The cities of Tokyo and Yokohama were badly damaged,
and many thousands of people died. In 1995, an earthquake with a magnitude of
6.9 on the Richter scale devastated Kobe, a port city southwest of Tokyo. By far the
strongest earthquake to hit Japan in many centuries occurred on March 11, 2011. The
Great Tohoku earthquake, as many people call it, measured 9.0 on the Richter scale. It
was the strongest earthquake known to hit Japan in recorded history. It was one of the
strongest ever recorded anywhere in the world. The earthquake’s epicenter was on the
ocean floor off Japan’s eastern coast.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 8** **123**


4 The 2011 earthquake caused violent shaking that brought many buildings tumbling
down. Streets heaved and bridges collapsed. The worst damage, however, came from
an enormous tsunami generated by the earthquake. Towering waves, some higher
than a three-story building, crashed ashore and surged far inland. Many thousands of
people died in the Great Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Hundreds of thousands of
people lost their homes.


5 As you might expect in a country that has so many earthquakes, Japan monitors
Earth’s plate movements very closely. It has one of the most advanced earthquake
early warning systems in the world. Earthquake scientists have installed thousands
of seismographs across Japan. These instruments detect the slightest movements
in the ground beneath them. They send information about these movements to a
central location. When an earthquake strikes, a warning is sent out. The idea is to
give people time to move to safer places and quickly protect themselves. The problem
is earthquakes almost always strike suddenly and happen very quickly. Japan’s
earthquake early warning system issued a warning for the 2011 earthquake. Sendai,
the largest city closest to the epicenter, had just 15 seconds of warning before the
shaking began.


6 In addition to frequent earthquakes, Japan also has volcanoes. The country lies along
the Pacific Ocean’s volcanic Ring of Fire. Japan has more than 100 active volcanoes.
People often link volcanoes, like earthquakes, with terrible destruction. But volcanoes
can also be creative natural forces. In Japan, you can see this creative power in action.


7 A new volcanic island is forming off Japan’s coast. In late November 2013, an
underwater volcano erupted near the Bonin Islands, a small island chain south of
Japan. Enough lava erupted from the volcano’s top to form a dome of igneous rock
that stuck up above the ocean’s surface. Pictures taken by satellites showed that the
seawater around this new, tiny island contained minerals, bubbling gases, and seafloor
sediments. All of these things were stirred up by the volcanic activity. More eruptions
followed. The island grew bigger with each one. Japanese volcano scientists named the
new island Niishima.


8 By January 2014, however, Niishima had expanded not just upward but also outward.
It grew large enough to collide with its nearest neighbor, another island called
Nishinoshima. The two islands are now one! As long as the eruptions continue, the
world’s youngest island will keep growing. It is a volcanic work in progress.

**The Layers of Cappadocia**


_Now you will read a literary text that describes a family who recently moved to Cappadocia,_
_Turkey. Cappadocia is a region of Turkey found in the west-central part of the country. Its_
_cave-like rock houses are famous, and there are thousands of them. The houses are clustered_
_into rock villages and towns. Some estimate that people have been carving and living in_
_these houses for more than 2,000 years. Volcanoes, however, laid the original foundations._


1 “Cappadocia, Turkey. I can’t believe we moved here, a place all the way across the
world from where I used to live!” Lola said to her cat, Pumpkin. “If my parents
moved us this far there must be something special about this place, and I must find
it,” she added.


2 What Lola didn’t know at the time was that her new home, and all the ones like it,
were carved into the rock left behind by Mount Erciyes. Though Mount Erciyes is
an inactive volcanic mountain today, it once was very active. Geologists estimate
that it erupted over 9 million years ago. Geologists also think that other volcanoes
in the area, like Mount Hasan, erupted nearby as early as 14 million years ago. The
landscape of Cappadocia was forever changed by this volcanic activity, and then,
over time, by weathering and erosion, too. As humans settled the area, they began
carving chambers and tunnels into the rock.


3 “It’s time to explore our new home. Come on, Pumpkin, let’s go.”


4 Lola and Pumpkin studied their new cave home and the hidden spaces carved into
the ancient rock. While peering through the area that Lola’s dad was turning into
an office, Pumpkin found a small fragment of a rock on the floor and began playing
with it. “What’s this?” said Lola. When she looked closer, she saw that the rock had
broken from a crack in the closet floor. As Lola gently brushed away the dust from
the crack, she saw it extended deep into the floor below her. She knocked on it like
she would knock on a door. It sounded hollow. She hit it again, and this time her
hand burst through the floor.


5 “Dad!” yelled Lola. “You need to see this!”

8 Javier, Lola, and Pumpkin peered into the space below the floor with wide eyes.


9 “I think I see something. It looks like another room down there,” said Javier.


10 ”Let’s find out. I’ll get the flashlight!” Lola exclaimed.


11 The space below the floor was not just a hole. It was the entrance to a hidden cave
dwelling that might have been covered up for thousands of years! As Lola and Javier
explored the cave, they were looking for visible layers in the rock. The layers would
show that the caves were most likely made of sedimentary rock.


12 “Pumpkin, there are no layers here. You know what that means, right?”


13 “Meow,” answered Pumpkin.


14 “That’s right! It means Mount Erciyes must have been an active volcano once. This
rock is not sedimentary, so it must be igneous.” Lola asked, “Dad, can you tell me
more about it?”


15 Javier smiled, “You are right! Mount Erciyes was a volcano. A long time ago it
erupted magma and ash. The ash rained down throughout the entire area for a long
time.”


16 “Rained ash?” Lola asked.


17 “Yes, Lola.” Javier replied. “Volcanoes can shoot out large amounts of ash, lava, gases,
and rocks. What is amazing about this place is that the ash cemented together and
hardened. It formed a rock called tuff.”


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 8** **129**


18 “I knew it was igneous!” Lola exclaimed, hugging Pumpkin. “Some of the tuff is really
tall. It looks like it could be taller than 100 feet. Part of it seems soft enough to break
through with a rock and a nudge. Yet most of the tuff seems sturdy enough for us to
carve into houses. The tough tuff must have been through a lot of pressure for a long
time to get as strong as it is today,” she said with a smile on her face.


19 Lola, Javier, and Pumpkin inspected the rocks one last time, then stepped outside.


20 “I wonder what else we’ll discover outside. Let’s go, Pumpkin! Let’s check out more of
this tuff stuff,” said Lola as she picked up her notebook and pencil to document her
findings.
