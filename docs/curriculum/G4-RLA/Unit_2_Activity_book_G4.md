**JACQUES’S COLLABORATION**
**BUILDING CHALLENGE**






Notes on group work:


You will work in your lab to complete this building challenge. In
order to be successful, you will need to work together! Ensure
that all lab members are given an opportunity to express
their opinion and that everyone is contributing to the process.
Listen carefully to what the other members of your group have
to say. Their ideas may help you come up with a new idea of
your own.


For this challenge, one team member will be assigned the role
of building manager.


The building manager leads the decision-making process.
This does not mean that the building manager has to do all of
the work, or that the group uses all of the building manager’s
ideas! But sometimes, when a group has many ideas, it can
be hard to decide which one to try first. The building manager
should listen to the lab and help make that decision. They
can call for a vote, or, if there’s a tie, break the tie. If there
are several tasks to be accomplished at the same time, the
building manager can assign them. If you don’t know what you
should be doing to help, ask the building manager.

Think back on the group work rules that Jacques introduced and
that we addressed as a class in the “Learn from Last Season”
transcript and the building prompt.


Prove to Jacques that you were paying attention. Pick one rule
and write him a letter explaining how you used that rule during
the building activity.


You will also have the opportunity to ask for his advice about the
rules he has used when working with others.

ACTIVITY 3.2 Name:

Date:





Write a letter to Thomas Edison extolling the virtues of the light
bulb.


Your letter should be about two paragraphs long. That
means you might not have time to cover all the arguments
and evidence you gathered earlier, so choose your material
judiciously. Think about the story of the light bulb you want
to tell. As you develop your letter, you may also want to think
about information you learned about Mr. Edison’s personality
and life from his inventor card.



18


Here’s an opening to get you started:

Dear Mr. Edison,

Eureka! Student Inventor could not possibly succeed without you
as a judge. What show about invention can be taken seriously if it
doesn’t include the inventor of the light bulb, one of the greatest
inventions of all time?

The light bulb is a truly great invention because:

checked?

Dear network executives,

Don’t cancel Eureka! Student Inventor just because last season was
a failure! On the program this year, we have learned that failure
is an important tool in invention. The judges and our host have
used their failures from last season to learn how to make the show
better. Learning from failure works!

This season I learned by failing. Here’s how:

I also learned about,

a famous inventor who failed, too.

Think about the inventors you read
about—where did their inspirations
come from?


Think about the inventions you studied
and how invention breeds invention—is
there an invention that already exists
that could solve your problem if you
built on it or changed it?


Think about simple machines and give
yourself a challenge: if you were going
to solve your problem using one of the
simple machines, how could you do it?
