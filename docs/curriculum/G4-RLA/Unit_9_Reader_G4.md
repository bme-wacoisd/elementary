## ~~**The Story of Oil**~~

**Banana Shopping**

Suppose you and your grandmother
get on the bus, and you go to the
supermarket. All kinds of fruits are on
sale there, including bananas. You pick up
a bunch, along with flour, butter, and
eggs. Then you take the bus home, and
you make your banana bread.

**Banana Travels**

What does baking banana bread
have to do with the story of **oil** ? Well,
have you ever asked yourself where
bananas come from? In much of
the United States, the answer is:
somewhere else! We grow a few
bananas in the United States, but most

of them come to us from Asia and
South America.

**The Formation of Oil**

Have you ever stopped to think
about how the food we eat is grown?
In order for bananas to grow, they
must go through a process called
photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the
process of using energy from sunlight
to create food. All plants, algae, and


**1**


some microorganisms require this process to live and grow. Photosynthetic
organisms live on land and in water. Once the bananas are grown on farms
in South America and Asia, we use boats to transport them to the United
States. It’s a long way from there to here. If we didn’t have boats that could
make the trip fast enough, all the bananas would spoil, or become unhealthy
to eat. There’d be no banana bread for anyone.

**Ship Diagram**

To get the speed they need, the
people who make boat engines use a
special source of **fuel** . Fuel is any kind
of material that releases **energy** when
you burn it. (For example, when you
make a campfire, the wood you burn
is the campfire’s fuel.) One kind of fuel
in boat engines—and in many kinds
of engines, in fact!—is called oil. (There are other kinds of oils besides the
kind we burn in engines, like olive oil or vegetable oil. The kind of oil in
engines is a fluid based on **petroleum** .) When it burns inside an engine, it
releases gas that pushes up and down on a part called a **piston** . When the
piston pumps, it starts to turn the gears of the engine very fast. And those
gears turn a boat’s **propellers** fast enough to get the bananas to a port, where
a truck drives them to your supermarket.

**World Without Oil**

Our world would be very different
without oil. In the days before oil, it
really was very different! People ate a
less **diversified** diet, and traveled less,
and worked in different ways. Before oil,
you might never have met anyone from
outside your hometown, unless you
made a very special effort because travel


**2**


was slow and hard. Now people travel the world. We know more about one
another than we ever did. And, in many ways, that’s because of oil.

**Gasoline Pump**

Oil is a big part of the story of
our world. But what’s the story of oil?
Where did it come from? How did we
come to start using it? How can we
best use and conserve oil and other
natural resources?


In this unit, we’ll answer some of these questions. We’ll look at how
the energy stored in oil goes all the way back to the sun, which provides
energy to all living organisms through the food chain that starts with
photosynthesis. Over time, these living organisms died and were sealed
underground. There, their bodies broke down and were slowly transformed
into the oil we burn. Did you know that when buried for a long time, under
high heat and pressure, organisms break down into a chemical called
**carbon** ? Carbon is the building block of life. Forms of carbon make up all
plants and animals, including the human body. It is also the main ingredient
in oil.


**Spindletop**

We’ll also look at one of the most
important discoveries of oil in modern
times. That discovery happened in
Texas with an **oil well**, a hole dug
in the ground to extract oil, called
Spindletop, in a city called Beaumont.
People had discovered oil before in
many places around the world, but
the Spindletop well was just the start of a huge supply of oil, and all of it was
coming from Texas. Oil was useful to many businesses for all the reasons


**3**


we talked about and others we will learn about, and that made it **valuable**,
or something people wanted to pay a lot of money for. Soon lots of oil was
flowing out of Texas, and lots of money was flowing back into it.

**Houston Community**

The oil business made Texas
one of the richest states in the United
States, but it also transformed the
culture of Texas. Because oil was so
important to the **world economy**,
or the way goods and services are
bought and sold around the world, it
brought workers and their families to Houston from all across the country.
The economic opportunity brought many African-Americans from the
Mississippi Delta, as well as many workers and their families from Mexico
and across Latin America, all contributing to the economy and cultural
diversity of Houston. Houston is now home to America’s largest Hispanic
population. The oil **industry** also attracted many immigrants from countries
like Cambodia, Vietnam, India, Pakistan, and Iran. All these people brought
their music and cultural traditions with them, too. With so many traditions
and people all in the same place, talking to one another and learning from
one another, Houston became a **cosmopolitan** city, a city with a culture that
traveled the entire world.

**Scientists**

That’s all part of the story of oil.
And the story is still being written:
no one knows yet exactly what will
happen next! These days, scientists are
also discovering new energy sources,
including renewables, and innovating
existing energy sources, such as fossil
fuel production and use. Scientists


**4**


are exploring how to use all of these energy sources more efficiently.
For example, improvements in the efficiency of renewables by reducing
the number of batteries will reduce the need for mining rare earth metals.
Scientists are also looking into ways for fossil fuels to release fewer particles
into the atmosphere, such as using industrial scrubbers. We’ll look at some
of the ideas they’ve had. And then we’ll each become a scientist and decide
which of those ideas seems like the best choice for different situations.

**Looking to the Future**

So, listen carefully as we explore the
story of oil! After all, one of you may be
the person who writes the next chapter.

## ~~**Texas Energy:**~~ **Variety is the Spice of Life**

Imagine what life would be like if you could only eat one type of food.
You might realize that variety is important! From barbeque to international
cuisine, many Texans enjoy diverse flavors and spices. In addition to food,
Texas is also diverse in another important way: energy sources. Texas has
a variety of natural resources available and an innovative energy industry,
which makes the state a leader in energy production.

**Texas’ Unique Geography**

Texas’ unique geographic diversity gives it an advantage because of the
many natural resources that are available. Data from the U.S. Geological
Survey shows that Texas has greater diversity of land cover, or types of
land, compared to nearly all other U.S. states. The state has forests, plains,
mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, and a long coastline. This diversity
provides many different natural resources.

**A Variety of Natural Resources**

Many of Texas’ natural resources are used for energy production,
which provides things like electricity, heat, and fuel throughout the state.
Oil and natural gas reserves, coal, sun, wind, and uranium—which is used
to produce nuclear energy—are all naturally available in Texas. Texans
harness, or make use of, the power of fossil fuels—like oil and gas—as well
as renewable resources—like wind and solar power. This diverse energy mix
is important because it provides multiple energy sources to rely on.


**6**


All energy sources have strengths and weaknesses. Using a variety of
energy sources means that one source’s strengths can balance out another’s
weaknesses. For example, a strength of solar power is that it uses the sun
as a natural resource which, unlike other fuel types, will never expire or
run out. However, one weakness of solar power is that the panels used
to capture and the batteries used to store the sun’s energy are made of
materials that can run out. Also, if a state were to rely only on solar power,
that state might be at risk of power shortages during less sunny times. Plus,
the state would have to spend a lot of money to store the energy once it is
produced, to save for less sunny days. Relying solely on solar power would
mean that there would be times when there would not be enough energy
to power the things people use in their daily lives. There is a lower risk of
power shortages when energy can be harnessed from multiple sources.
Lastly, because of the abundant natural resources and diverse energy
sources that are produced, Texans have access to reliable energy without
depending on other states or countries.

**Innovations Harness the Power of Natural Resources**

Although the natural resources available in Texas give the state an
advantage, these natural resources do not create usable energy on their
own. The power of natural resources must be harnessed and turned
into usable energy. First, people must modify the environment to obtain
natural resources. This includes extracting oil and gas or installing
windmills and solar panels. Then, the natural resources must be
processed, or converted into a useful form. For example, oil refineries
process crude oil, transforming it into many different products that can
be used for several purposes, such as transportation, heating, and even
food preservation.


Texas’ strong energy industry works to develop new innovations
that improve energy production. Innovations are new inventions or ideas


**7**


that are created for a purpose. Innovations can solve problems within the
energy industry and lead to new opportunities in energy. Let’s consider the
Texas of the past as an example. According to the Texas State Historical
Association, many parts of Texas could not be permanently settled until the
mid-1850s because they were too far from a natural water source. At that
time, innovations in the design of windmills allowed Texans to access water
deep underground. This helped drive the modernization, or development,
of those areas. With greater access to water, railroads could more easily
power their steam engines, making travel to these parts of Texas easier.
Today, new developments continue to solve energy problems in Texas,
such as making energy more reliable, reducing environmental impacts, and
lowering costs. For example, scientists and engineers are investigating the
idea of mixing hydrogen with natural gas to create a mixture that will burn
cleaner. As leaders work to improve energy production, the energy industry
is constantly changing. This never-ending cycle of innovation keeps the
energy industry in Texas strong.


Texas’ diverse energy mix is a result of the variety of natural
resources available and the innovations of the energy industry. The
unique geography of the state provides many different types of energy
resources, while innovations harness their power. Which do you think
is more important: the variety of natural resources available or the
innovations created to harness and produce energy?

Hello. I’m Professor Pietro Leo, and I’m going to tell you about an
incredible discovery that changed the history of Texas: a gigantic black
gush that came out of the depths of the earth.


The events took place during the cold winter morning of
January 10, 1901, on a small hill called Spindletop, on the outskirts of
Beaumont. For years, many people had been unsuccessfully digging in
the hill’s ground searching for oil.

**The Hamill Brothers Arrive at Spindletop**

At that time, a group of drillers was working on the hill under the
command of three men: brothers Jim, Curt, and Al Hamill. They had
arrived at Spindletop on October 1, 1900, after being hired by the owner
of that land, Pattillo Higgins. As soon as they got there, they looked for a
place to put their equipment. They found an abandoned hut, full of rusty
tools among armies of spiders and cockroaches. The men looked at one
another. This was better than nothing! They all worked together to clean
the hut as best they could because that would be their new home until
they finished the job. For how long? No one knew.


Once they were settled in, the men got down to work. They dug
**trenches** to bring water from a nearby swamp. They built a wooden
derrick over what would be the future well. That **derrick** would hold
the metal pipes that they would put into the ground as they dug a deep
hole. Once the derrick was finished, the men mounted a **boiler** on top


**9**


of it to power the steam engine that would run their digging tool.


The team planned to use a special tool called a **rotary drill**, a recent
innovation as of 1845. Until then, oil had been searched for using a chisel
drill, which did not rotate or turn. It pounded the earth to dig the wells. But
the Hamill brothers knew that the rotary drill was best for sandy soils like
the soil on that hill. The tool consisted of a rotating tube driven by a motor.
At the lower end of the tube, there was a piece with sharp teeth called a **bit** .
The bit rotated to cut through the sand, rock, and mud in the ground.

**The First Attempts**

At first, the progress had been slow because the bit would get stuck
in the first sandy layers of the ground. The men poured water into the
well to carry the sand out, but the sand absorbed much of the water and
settled back at the bottom. After twenty days into the job, the team had
reached 400 feet deep. But there were still several problems to solve. Sand
was still accumulating in the hole. The drill bits were already **blunt** . They


**10**


had run out of wood to feed the boiler. Wood was a common energy
source in Texas during this time, but it required a lot of wood to feed
the boiler because it was not an efficient energy source. With all of these
problems no wonder the men were exhausted and hopeless.


Curt Hamill thought that if they poured mud instead of water into
the well, the sand wouldn’t absorb it as much, and the mud would help
carry it out. The idea worked, and the team moved forward. At the
end of the year, the men stopped work for a few days to celebrate the
holidays with their families. But on January 1, 1901, they were all back.


On the morning of January 10, the drill bit got stuck in a layer of
hard rocks. The men removed the tool to change the bit. Once the new
one was in place, they put the drill down into the well, which had already
reached 700 feet deep. And here’s what I wanted to tell you about . . .

**A Dark Surprise**

When the drill reached the bottom, a strange hissing sound filled
the air on the hill. Immediately, a thick column of mud gushed from
deep in the earth, carrying with it the very heavy pieces of pipe placed
inside the well. The men ran in a hurry, trying to dodge the huge pieces
of metal falling from the sky toward their heads! After the mud and the
pieces of pipe landed all over the place with a loud noise, the place fell
silent. The men slowly and cautiously approached the derrick, ready to
run away again if anything else happened.


The first thing they saw was the terrible state of the area around
the well. The ground was covered by a thick layer of mud with huge
pieces of pipe sticking out. Shaking their heads, the workers began to
remove the **debris** with their shovels. But while they were focused on
the task, knee-deep in mud, they felt the ground begin to shake with a
deafening roar. Then a gigantic greenish-black jet gushed from inside
the hole! What was it? Nothing less than oil!


**11**


The immense gush reached 100 feet high above the derrick. The
men were covered in oil from head to toe. Dazed, they tried to wipe
the oil from their eyes to see what was happening. The first thing they
saw, besides the huge black column, was a fire in the boiler they used to
activate the drill. The air was filled with the natural gas and oil spewing
from the well. If they didn’t put out the fire soon, they all ran the risk of
being blown into the air in a loud explosion! So, the men began to work
to put out the flames until the fire was extinguished.

**Meanwhile . . .**

What was going on around Spindletop as the drillers worked to put
out the fire, and the gush kept going out and roaring nonstop? First, the
animals ran away when they heard the loud noise. Farmers watched in
amazement as the thick black liquid rained down. A carpenter building
a barn dropped his tools, mounted his horse, and galloped off to nearby
Beaumont to report the news.


The townspeople crowded on the roofs of their houses to catch a
sight of the gigantic black column. Hundreds of others wanted to have
a closer look and set out immediately, in **buggies** or on horseback,
to travel the four miles to the site. Soon, the area around Spindletop
was filled with onlookers. Many were probably wondering what
opportunities the discovery of oil could mean for their town.

**A New Era**

The roaring jet that began to gush out at 10:30 a.m. on that cold,
clear winter morning continued to flow nonstop for nine days. The
drillers built mud dams to contain the oil. Plows were used to bury
the oil-soaked ground to decrease the risk of fire. But nothing was
able to fully contain the oil flowing from the well. Workers became ill
from breathing the oil and **fumes** that filled the air as they worked.
The gusher had to be cut off. Finally, the Hamill brothers succeeded


**12**


in shutting it off with a risky (but effective) system of pipes and valves.
Using these innovations, the Hamill brothers and other oil workers
were able to solve the problems they encountered.


When silence returned, the men realized what had happened: they
had just discovered the largest oil well ever seen up to that time. That
“black gold” marked the beginning of a new era in the history of oil, but
also in the history of Texas. Why did I use the words _black gold_ to refer
to oil? In the next lessons, we will be answering this question.


**13**


## **United States**

**The First Oil Well**

Do you remember the exciting story of Spindletop and the giant jet
of oil that gushed from the ground for nine days straight? Now let’s look
at why the Spindletop drillers were so determined to find that strange
liquid.


**14**


_**The Formation of Oil**_


**The Formation of Oil**

Today we know that the energy stored in oil started with the sun.
Through photosynthesis, the sun’s energy is used to make sugar from
carbon dioxide and water. This conversion of solar energy to chemical
energy is the basis of all food webs for ecosystems with access to the sun.
The ocean is filled with billions of tiny plants, algae, and bacteria that
undergo photosynthesis. Some of these organisms are eaten by ocean
animals, transferring their energy along the way. This
transfer of energy flows up through each food chain
and gets stored in the cells of living creatures.


When these organisms died, they sank to the
bottom of the oceans. Over the years, their remains
were buried under multiple layers of rock and sand.
The decomposition of these remains raised the
temperature of the place where they were buried. The
high temperatures, combined with the weight of the
countless layers that accumulated, caused a chemical
reaction that turned the remains into oil.
_**Diagram of Oil in the**_
_**Ocean**_
Once the ancient seas dried up, the oil was trapped
under tons of earth at great depths. However, the strange oily liquid
seeped through rocks and sand to the earth’s surface in small quantities.


**15**


Sometimes, it accumulated in **depressions** in the ground. Other times,
it floated as an oily **film** on the water of lakes and streams.

**Oil in History**

Over time, people around the world discovered different ways
to use the oil that appeared on the surface of earth. For example, the
ancient Egyptians used it to make their mummies. Centuries later,
medieval knights used oil to shine their metal armor. Native Americans
used it in the preparation of skin ointments. Later, oil proved useful for
sealing cracks in wooden boats. It was also used to grease the wheels of
buggies, and it was even burned in lamps for light. There was no doubt
that oil was very useful. However, until the nineteenth century, no one
knew how to **extract** it from underground.


Lighting was one of the main uses that oil seemed to offer. In the
nineteenth century, the main product used by Americans to light their
lamps was whale oil. In spite of its ability to provide light, whale oil had
an odor and was not as efficient as other energy sources. Gradually,
whales became scarce, and, consequently, their oil became more and
more expensive. As a result, many businesspeople began to think about
obtaining oil in larger quantities.


Before Spindletop, oil discoveries were made in other parts of the
United States. Samuel Kier was an American chemist who owned a
salt **deposit** in Titusville, Pennsylvania. One of the nearby streams was
leaking oil, which made salt production difficult. Kier decided to study
the strange oily and **flammable** compound. After several experiments,
he succeeded in refining oil into kerosene, a material that could be
used to light lamps without the smoke and odor produced by crude oil.
Upon seeing the usefulness and economic potential of the strange black
liquid, a businessman named George Bissell partnered with others to
found an oil company.


**16**


**Sprouting Oil**

Bissell needed men of action to investigate the sprouting crude oil
that was very common in Pennsylvania. He met Edwin Drake, who knew
nothing about mining or geology but had a great ability to handle all kinds
of tools, possessed a very stubborn character, and liked challenges. Bissell
didn’t think twice: Drake was the perfect candidate.


Drake began to work in Titusville in early 1858. At first, he made small
**excavations** in the form of trenches. After several months without results,
Drake realized that he had to think of a more **ambitious** project. In mid­
1858, he planned to drill a well many feet deep, similar to those made to
extract salt. (One meter is about 3 feet deep.) He built a wooden derrick and
bought a tool to strike the rock that was powered by a steam machine. Most
steam engines during this time were powered by wood or coal. Coal powered
steam engines in heavier machines, such as trains. The rotary drill had not
been created yet, and his men worked for almost a year with no results.
Bissell and his partners decided to stop funding the project. But Drake didn’t
want to give up. So, with money from his friends and a loan, he kept working
to fulfill his dream. No one believed he could make it. But Drake didn’t pay
attention to the doubts or ridicule of others and continued to work tirelessly.


In August 1859, when the well was 69 feet deep, the drilling crew
encountered a strange crack. The next morning, on August 27, Drake and
his workers smelled the unmistakable odor of crude oil. They had found
the first oil well in history!

**After the Discovery**

The discovery attracted countless businesspeople who dug hundreds
of wells in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Indiana. Most of
the oil was refined into kerosene. While oil was refined, gasoline also
appeared in small quantities. But gasoline couldn’t be used for lighting
because it produced explosions. (No one yet imagined the use it would
have many years later.) As a result, most of the gasoline was dumped into
lakes and streams near the refineries.


**17**


**Spindletop Hill**

In the 1890s, workers searching for water in Corsicana, Texas,
accidentally discovered a small oil deposit. Meanwhile, on the outskirts
of Beaumont, another Texas town, a man named Pattillo Higgins
became interested in a small hill called Spindletop. Do you remember
it? Higgins had noticed that Spindletop was leaking natural gas, and he
knew that natural gas and oil are often found in the same place.


One day, he saw a sign advertising land for sale at Spindletop
at a very good price: six dollars an acre. He started buying land with
the purpose of searching for oil. Higgins had big plans. However, his
excavations between 1883 and 1886 were unsuccessful.


When Higgins ran out of money, he posted an ad looking for an
**investor** . Only Captain Anthony Lucas responded. After finding a small
amount of oil in 1899, Lucas also ran out of money and went out to
look for investors in Pennsylvania. He asked the wealthy businessman
John D. Rockefeller, who made a fortune by founding the Standard
Oil Company. Rockefeller controlled most of the oil in America at the
time, but he turned Lucas down because Rockefeller didn’t believe there
was oil in that Texan hill. However, other oil exploration businessmen,
Guffrey and Galey, decided to take the risk.


Lucas told them that no one had ever been able to dig wells deeper
than 400 feet on Spindletop Hill because of the sandy ground. Back then, a
chisel drill was used to search for oil. A chisel drill was a very big tool that
was used to drill through the rocks. But that only worked in rocky, hard
areas. In sandy ground, the chisel drill just **compressed** the earth. Guffrey
and Galey told him not to worry because they knew the Hamill brothers.
Do you remember that name? Jim, Al, and Curt Hamill were using a new
tool, the rotary drill, to dig wells over 1,200 feet deep. Do you remember
how the rotary drill worked? The businessmen called Jim, the oldest of the
brothers, who was working at Corsicana, to hire him. Jim sent Al and Curt
to take on the new job. And you know what happened next!

## ~~**An Argument**~~ **in Favor of Natural Gas** **Led by Texas**

Our modern world runs on energy, and the need for it increases with
demand. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration,
energy use in America alone increased more than eight times
from 1900 to 2011. Energy is used in industries such as farming,
transportation, and technology, and is key for their success. One
essential source of energy is natural gas, a resource that is abundant in
Texas. The production and use of natural gas from Texas as the leading
source of energy is critical to meet these increasing demands and
ensure America’s future.


First, natural gas is critical to meet America’s increasing energy
demands because it can provide the large supply of energy needed
to power our lives. Did you know that in 2011, natural gas was used
more than any other source in America? It provided 30 percent of
the total energy needed. Natural gas is extracted from shale, a type
of sedimentary rock. There are large shale formations throughout
Texas that hold enormous amounts of natural gas. Recent innovations
in drilling techniques have enabled access to these large reserves,
increasing the supply of energy available in Texas. It makes sense to
use natural gas because of its abundance and its ability to meet the
increasing demands for energy.


Another reason to use natural gas is that it has fewer
environmental risks than other sources of energy. It is true that
using natural gas requires drilling and releases some pollutants;

**19**


however, the next-largest source of energy used to produce electricity
is coal, which requires harmful and dangerous mining and releases
more significant amounts of pollution. For example, today China
uses coal as its primary energy source, leading to significant air
pollution problems in that country. Other forms of energy used
to generate electricity, such as wind and solar, generate less air
pollution, but these sources also require mining and large tracts of
land. Lastly, because their materials cannot be recycled, these sources
still have some negative environmental impacts. (It should be noted
that America has regulations that make working in mines safer and
cleaner than other parts of the world.)


The third major advantage of using natural gas is its reliability.
Wind and solar power can only generate power when the wind is
blowing or when the sun is shining. Also, there’s a limit to the amount
of energy from wind and solar that can be stored by the technology of
today’s electric companies. Because people need a constant and reliable
source of energy, natural gas is the best solution. It is a dependable
energy source because it can be consistently obtained from shale
deposits all over Texas. Power plants are then able to generate energy 24
hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Moreover, innovations have
already improved the ability to store fuel and generate electricity from
natural gas. As a result, energy production can easily be increased and
decreased to match demand, making it available when it is needed.


To sum it up, using natural gas as a core source of energy is key
to maintaining our modern quality of life. The natural gas supplied by
Texas provides the large amounts of energy we need. Natural gas is more
reliable and has fewer environmental risks than other energy sources.
Texas can even export natural gas to other countries, helping improve
the quality of life for people around the world. The next time you play
outside under the lights, power up a computer, or visit the doctor’s office,
remember the critical role natural gas plays in powering your life!


**20**


**Beaumont Wakes Up**

In the days and months following that discovery, crowds poured
into the sleepy town of Beaumont. Many newcomers were tourists
who wanted to visit the hill that had suddenly become famous. The
road from Beaumont to Spindletop was filled with buggies and
horses carrying hundreds of visitors eager to stroll through the oilsaturated fields. Along with the tourists came businesspeople and
**speculators** who wanted to buy the neighboring land. Many men


**21**


seeking employment also arrived, and they were soon hired by the new
oil companies. Even men without any experience in drilling had the
chance to earn two or three dollars a day: double the pay earned by
workers in the rest of the country.


Exploration derricks increased rapidly all over the hill. By the
spring of 1901, there were 138 oil wells. Most were concentrated in
an area of 15 acres. That is close to eleven football fields with twelve
derricks on each field. Heavy equipment was everywhere. The air on
the hill was filled with the unmistakable smell of oil and natural gas,
the fumes from the boilers that powered the drills, and the smoke from
the kerosene-fueled lamps. There was danger from all of this, but there
was also real opportunity. There were huge profits to be made by those
willing to work hard and to take risks.

**Population Changes**

Until January 1901, when the discovery took place, there were
nine thousand people living in Beaumont. But in the three months
that followed, that number rose to fifty thousand! Soon there were
not enough hotels or rooms to accommodate the growing crowds of
newcomers. The exhausted oil well workers slept in tents and even rented
pool tables, store windows, barbers’ chairs, or office desks to spend the
night. There was much money to be made by those willing to work hard.


It was difficult to satisfy the hunger of the crowds that arrived daily
in Beaumont. Many cafeterias and food stores remained open through
the night. Another problem was providing enough clean drinking
water for everyone. Many newcomers got sick from drinking water
from **polluted** streams and rivers. In addition, freshwater sources were
breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which feasted on the workers who
slept in tents or spent the night in the streets. Some of these mosquitoes
spread serious diseases, such as malaria.


**22**


This led to another problem: health care. Now there weren’t
enough doctors to treat all the sick and injured people. Inexperienced
oil well workers would often get hurt when handling the huge digging
tools. Fires, and even explosions, were also frequent. However, the
opportunity to earn high wages and make profits attracted many
risk-takers willing to face tough conditions to Beaumont. Trains kept
arriving daily with people from faraway places like Philadelphia or
New York.

**New Towns**

The land that Pattillo Higgins had bought at six dollars an acre a
few years earlier was now selling for as much as a million dollars an
acre. Many newcomers made fortunes, going from rags to riches by
taking risks and working hard. Even more people were able to leave
a world of poverty behind, their lives forever improved by seizing the
new opportunities from oil.


As the opportunities to make money in Beaumont increased, the
newcomers multiplied by the thousands. Among them were many
honest people, but there were also gamblers and thieves. Land sale
**scams** were common, causing some to be tricked out of all they had. As
pressures mounted, street riots became more frequent. The local police
couldn’t cope with all the calls for help from the neighbors. Beaumont
residents were terrified. The sheriff advised them to stay indoors and
padlock their doors if they wanted to stay safe.


In the few months following the discovery of the first well, new
towns were formed around the well excavations. One of these was
Gladys City, which consisted of a group of wooden buildings that
included a post office, a newsstand and candy store, a photography
studio, and a general store that sold all kinds of goods needed for daily
life. There were also bedrooms and cafeterias to **host** and feed the


**23**


oil drillers. Drilling for oil had increased nonstop after the discovery
of 1901. Where once there were only trees and grass, the number of
derricks was growing every day.

**Large Supply**

Prior to 1901, ninety percent of U.S. oil had been produced in the
East Coast. In fact, most of that oil was produced by the Standard Oil
Company, owned by John D Rockefeller, one of the richest people on
Earth. He controlled oil production, keeping supply low and prices
high. But the first Spindletop well went on to produce more oil than all
the Pennsylvania wells combined.


By the end of 1901, oil prices had fallen from a dollar a barrel
to three cents a barrel. Because the supply of oil had been limited by
what was provided by Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company, only a few
products using oil had been developed. The main product of oil was
kerosene, which was used for lamps. But there weren’t enough lamps in
the United States to burn the enormous quantities of oil gushing out of
Spindletop. But with a low cost, far more profitable innovations from
this **abundant** natural resource could finally be developed.


We are out of time for today. But don’t worry—I’ll be back so that
together we can see what those new uses and innovations were.


**24**


Do you remember Spindletop? Last time, we saw the great changes
that happened in the lives of the local people during the days and
months following the discovery of the largest oil well known until then.


Today we’re going to look at other changes that took place over time
for the people of Beaumont, the rest of the country, and the whole world.

**The Oil Industry Grows**

During the year following the discovery of Spindletop, the Texas oil
industry grew enormously. The United States became the world’s major
oil producer. Many of the country’s most important oil companies were
born and grew thanks to this discovery, among them Texaco, the shortened
name of the Texas oil company. These companies made money selling oil
in the United States and abroad. In fact, after Spindletop oil production in
the United States tripled. Though some countries in Asia and Europe were
beginning to find oil too, many relied on the United States to meet their oil
needs. They did not become **energy independent** until they were able to
produce the oil they needed without buying from other countries.


As we saw in the previous lesson, the oil extracted from Spindletop
wells was more than the **demand** for the main product manufactured at
that time with this resource: kerosene to light lamps. And what do you
think was done with the oil that wasn’t used? It was stored in tanks, which
weren’t well made and **contaminated** the soil and freshwater sources.


Wooden and metal tanks were built throughout Spindletop Hill
to store the oil. Tanks were also built that trains and **barges** could use
to transport the extra oil to be sold across the country. Although it


**25**


was known that oil could be a good fuel for steam-powered forms of
transportation, train and ship engines were still using coal. Do you know
why? Because oil was more expensive, and it was hard to get.

**Changes in Transportation**

The first type of transportation to switch from coal to oil were
trains in Texas and the Southwest. The coal that fueled those trains was
bought far away on the East Coast at very high prices because it had to
be transported over hundreds of miles. But the discovery of Spindletop
changed this situation greatly. From then on, oil became an abundant,
cheap, and local resource in Texas.


The Texas train experiment was so successful that other train
companies also made the change from coal to oil. Ship companies that
transported **goods** to other regions of the country and the world also joined.


The change from coal to oil didn’t require **modifying** the engines.
Both train and ship engines were powered by boiling water to make
steam. All that was needed was to change the boilers’ fuel from coal to oil.


Oil offered great advantages over coal. For example, oil burns
cleaner than coal. Another interesting fact is that oil is a more dense
form of energy. This means that there is a lot of power in this form
of energy compared to other forms. Coal took up much more space,
especially for ships that made long trips. Many men were needed to
load the coal onto the ships for several days. Once the coal was on
board the ship, other men had to take turns shoveling the coal into the
furnaces, where the water for the boilers was boiled. The boiler rooms,
located below deck, were very hot places to work!


On the other hand, oil was loaded by a few men in a few hours.
Once on board, the oil was stored in tanks. The oil furnaces were also
smaller and didn’t need shovelers.



**26**




The replacement of coal with oil, both on trains and ships, freed
up much of the space that was previously used to store fuel and power
engines. This was an added advantage for companies because now there
was more room to transport goods, and they could make more money.

**The Automobile Is Born**

The U.S. oil market continued to grow steadily during the early
twentieth century. New uses for oil spurred new exploration and
successful drilling in other parts of the country, but especially in Texas.
The oil business was growing, just in time to welcome a new invention:
the automobile!


In the late nineteenth century, many inventors experimented with
the use of engines to realize the dream of building a “horseless buggy,”
that is, a buggy capable of moving on its own.


One of the first automobile manufacturers in the United States was
Henry Ford. In 1896, Ford built a four-wheeled bicycle, powered by a
small engine, but without brakes or a reverse gear. In 1903, when his
designs had improved, Ford founded his famous automobile company.
But his breakthrough came in 1908 with the creation of the Model T.


The Model T, which reached speeds of 25 miles per hour, was the
first American automobile built using the assembly line method. The
assembly line was a **conveyor belt** with workers stationed at different
locations. Each worker performed a specific task and then passed
the product to the worker next to them. This made it possible to
produce automobiles at a low cost and very quickly. The production of
automobiles boosted the U.S. oil industry.


The growth of the oil industry wasn’t just an economic boon. It
kept America safe and free in a dangerous world. When World War I


broke out in Europe, American oil was key to a victory for America and
its allies to preserve democracy at home and abroad. Many U.S. ships
had oil-fueled boilers. Military vehicles and aircraft ran on gasoline too.
The same was true during World War II, when American oil became
a key to American victory in the war. After the wars, state and federal
governments invested in expanding our highways, leading to more
jobs and the ability for Americans to stay connected, even in times of
trouble. Oil produced in Texas has been critical to national security of
the United States for over a hundred years.


Even beyond keeping America free and safe, oil has become a
necessary material for many other comforts of modern life. The plastic
used today to make toys or to package food is also made from crude oil.
So are **synthetic** fabrics, such as polyester and nylon. Oil is also used
for heating homes, paving roads, waterproofing roofs, making medical
supplies, and in many other products. Today we have become so used
to these and many other innovations that it’s difficult to imagine a
world without oil.


**28**


entire town. The splitting of something small that can release a large
amount of energy is a simple way to start thinking of **nuclear energy** .

**How Does Nuclear Energy Work?**

The marble you were imagining represents an **atom** . Atoms
are the very small building blocks of everything on Earth. There are
many different types of atoms, which are called **chemical elements** .
Approximately ninety-two are found in nature, and about twenty-six
elements are made by scientists in labs. At the center of each atom is a
structure called the **nucleus** . Atoms last forever but sometimes undergo
changes to the nucleus that transform them into different elements.
These changes often release enormous amounts of energy.


**29**


One example of a nuclear change is when the nuclei of two atoms
combine to form one heavier atom. We can see this process, called
**nuclear fusion**, whenever we look up at the stars in the sky. For
example, the sun is powered by nuclear fusion, and, as a result, large
amounts of energy are released. This energy takes the form of heat and
**radiation** that make life on Earth possible. Radiation is energy that
moves from one place to another in the form of waves or particles.
Most of the time, radiation is harmless. For example, some low-energy
types of radiation that you are exposed to regularly include light from
the sun, radio waves, and microwaves.


The other example of nuclear
change is when an atomic nucleus
breaks apart and releases a lot
of energy. This process is called
**nuclear fission** . If the pieces of
the broken nuclei hit other atoms
and make those atoms break

_**Diagram of a Nuclear Reactor**_

apart, then a chain reaction of
nuclear fission might occur that can release energy on an ongoing basis.
This is the process that takes place in a special facility called a nuclear
**power plant** . Inside most of these plants, **uranium** atoms are split in
a nuclear chain reaction within structures known as **nuclear reactor** s.
This process releases significant amounts of energy. The energy is used
to heat water until it transforms into steam. This steam is used to spin
large fans, known as **turbines** . As these turbines spin, they generate
electricity. Once produced, this electricity is stored and eventually sent
out to power our homes and businesses. From the nuclei of uranium
atoms, the energy released in these power plants can make electricity to
power our lives.


**30**


**What Are Disadvantages of Nuclear Energy?**

The nuclear fission process produces atoms with unstable nuclei.
Scientists call this unstable product **radioactive** waste. The waste
product is radioactive because it gives off radiation. If done safely and
correctly, nuclear fission can release a lot of clean, controlled energy. If
not managed right, the radioactive waste products could be accidentally
released. Large amounts of radioactive waste are harmful to our bodies
and the environment. People who are exposed to radioactive waste a lot
over time can develop long-term sicknesses like cancer or may even die.
Radioactive waste can also get into water, soil, plants, and animals.


Nuclear reactors can use the same fuel for about forty to fifty
years. Replacing the fuel requires proper handling of the old fuel, which
is radioactive. In order to get rid of the radioactive waste safely, it is
placed in large tanks of water, where it is cooled. Then it is moved to
large concrete structures, where it is stored. The process of transporting
the waste can be dangerous if an accident happens along the way and
the waste leaks. Once it is safely transported, the waste must be kept
in special storage for thousands and thousands of years until it is no
longer radioactive.


Experts work hard to make sure nuclear power plants run safely
and responsibly. Safety rules around nuclear energy include using
special protective clothing, thick walls to contain the radiation, and
equipment to monitor and control radiation levels. By following safety
rules, humans can benefit from the power of nuclear energy. Still,
departing from these rules carries big risks. For example, if a person
working in a nuclear power plant does not properly discard a rag that
they used for work, that rag can hold radioactive waste that is then
released to whoever finds it. Further, though nuclear power plants take
great steps to ensure safety, accidents and natural disasters can still


**31**


occur and may prove dangerous. For example, if a catastrophic event
disrupts the process of cooling a nuclear plant, it can lead to releases
of radioactive materials. This has happened several times in the past,
including a disaster during a malfunction at a nuclear power plant on
Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979.


The cost to run nuclear power plants and keep them safe is high.
Plus, the process of building a power plant is complicated. Nuclear
plants are large and require a lot of money up-front to build. Due to
safety concerns and government regulation, the price to build a nuclear
power plant is very expensive. In order to run, they need to get approval


**32**


from local governments. They also need to prove they are prepared to
follow safety rules. Thus, it can take a long time and a lot of money to
get one nuclear power plant up and running.

**How Was Nuclear Energy Discovered?**

During the early 1900s, a famous scientist named Albert Einstein
proposed a groundbreaking idea. This concept would eventually
unravel the mystery behind nuclear energy. Einstein came up with a
mathematical equation that explains how energy and mass relate to
one another: _E=mc_ _[2]_ . This equation suggests that even a minuscule
amount of matter (m) has the potential to release an immense amount
of energy (E) because the speed of light (c) is multiplied by itself (2),
making it very large. Imagine having a single, tiny light bulb capable of
illuminating an entire school! That sums up nuclear energy really well,
where small amounts of nuclear matter can release a lot of energy.



recognized the potential of Einstein’s ideas. In
1942, the government assembled a team of top
scientists from various regions of the country.
Under the code name “Manhattan Project,”
this elite group embarked on a mission to
conquer the secret of nuclear energy. They
succeeded in splitting the atom, turning
Einstein’s theory into a reality. Among the
achievements at the project’s laboratory in Los
Alamos, New Mexico, was the creation of the
world’s first nuclear reactor.



_**Admiral Hyman G.**_
_**Rickover**_



In the aftermath of the Manhattan Project’s
successes, Texas began to explore the potential of nuclear energy. In
1946, a group called the Texas Research Foundation (TRF) was created.


**33**


Their goal was to make growing crops easier in Texas. Utilizing nuclear
materials in their research, the TRF developed fertilizers to help plants
grow quicker and stronger. They were one of the first organizations in
the country to explore the uses of nuclear energy.


Around the same time, a Texan named Hyman G. Rickover was
working hard on nuclear energy. He was an **admiral** in the U.S. Navy
who was tasked with a daunting job: to develop ships that could run on
nuclear energy. His work led to the first nuclear-powered vessels. While the
initial investment in these ships was considerable, they saved money in the
long run. Much of the savings came from cutting out the need for frequent
refueling. Nuclear vessels only stop to refuel once every twenty-five years!
This is especially helpful for submarines, which, before using nuclear
energy, relied on diesel for fuel. The exhaust from diesel was more
harmful for people to breathe. Thanks to nuclear energy, submarines
can now stay underwater for longer with cleaner air. Astonishingly, the
energy potential of these nuclear submarines is so vast that, if needed,
they could provide the electricity to power an entire town.


**34**


**Where Are Nuclear Power Plants?**

Nuclear energy plays a big role in powering the United States.
According to the World Nuclear Association, the United States operates
the largest number of nuclear reactors in the world. There are nearly one
hundred nuclear reactors scattered across the nation, providing power to
millions. Those reactors produce about twenty percent of the country’s
electricity, the equivalent of powering one out of every five buildings!
Safety has always been paramount for nuclear power plant operators in the
United States, which is why many nations look to American procedures
and protocols as the gold standard for safely harnessing nuclear energy.


_**Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant in Glen Rose**_


Were you aware that Texas is home to two major nuclear power
facilities? One is the Comanche Peak plant in Glen Rose. The other is the
South Texas Project plant in Bay City. These plants operate, day in and
day out, generating electricity for our homes, schools, and businesses.
**Why Use Nuclear Energy?**

Nuclear energy brings a lot of benefits to the table. The first benefit
is that nuclear plants can produce an incredible amount of energy.
Consider the two nuclear plants in Texas. In 2023, the Glen Rose and


**35**


Bay City power plants produced eleven percent of the energy **generated**
by the entire state. The South Texas Project plant on its own boasts the
capacity to power an astounding two million households.


Another benefit is that the reliability of these Texan nuclear plants
is unparalleled. Unlike renewables like wind and solar, nuclear plants
produce power day and night, ensuring there is always electricity when
it is needed. Notably, during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, the South
Texas Project plant remained operational. Even the wrath of a major
storm did not stop the nuclear plants!


Nuclear plants are engineered to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes,
and earthquakes. During storms, workers monitor the systems to make
sure all is running safely. The professionals monitoring nuclear plants
are always improving their safety features based on the latest technology.
Modern nuclear plants, for instance, employ specialized robots to inspect
and perform repairs within reactor chambers. These robots work in areas
where it would be dangerous or even impossible for humans to go.


Another key benefit
of nuclear power plants is
that they don’t pollute the
air. If you drive past the
nuclear plants in Glen Rose
or Bay City, you may see
what appears to be smoke
billowing from their large
smokestacks. But it isn’t
smoke. It is steam used to
spin turbines inside the plant.
Steam is just heated water and
is not much different than
clouds already in the air.


**36**


Like renewable energy sources, nuclear energy is appealing to
many because it produces far less air pollution than fossil fuels. But
many of those renewable energy sources do use a lot of one natural
resource in particular: land. Nuclear energy doesn’t take up much
space. According to the Nuclear Energy Institute, one nuclear energy
facility can generate 1,000 megawatts of energy on 1.3 square miles of
land. If a solar facility were to generate the same amount of energy, it
would require 31 times more land. Similarly, a wind farm would require
173 times more land.


Nuclear energy also helps create high-paying jobs. Texas’ two
nuclear facilities collectively employ around 2,400 individuals.
According to the Nuclear Energy Institute, the economic impact of
the South Texas Project plant is monumental, injecting over a billion
dollars annually into the state’s economy. Every one job there creates
almost two more jobs in the local area.


There are many types of jobs involved in making nuclear energy.
Some of the jobs at nuclear plants are engineers, physicists, plant
operators, and safety inspectors. Students who are interested in nuclear
energy can study it at many Texas universities. Here, students get
hands-on learning, which other schools might not be able to offer!

**What Is the Future of Nuclear Energy?**

Nuclear energy is clean, powerful, and reliable. The production
of nuclear energy already plays a major role in helping Texas make its
own electricity. As technology improves, producing nuclear energy
will only become cheaper, easier, and safer. In fact, new proposals for
small nuclear power plants are underway to reduce the cost and waste
of traditional nuclear power plants. This explains why the future of
nuclear energy in Texas looks bright.


**37**


~~**Part 1: Renewable Energy Explained**~~

Think back to the last time you experienced
a bright, sunny day. You might have been walking
outside and turned your face up to the sun. Imagine
the warmth of the sun’s light on your face and a cool
breeze ruffling your hair. Believe it or not, the sun
and the wind can be used to produce electricity.
They are sources of what we call **renewable energy** .
Renewable energy comes from things that are
**replenished** by nature. Let’s learn more about the
science behind solar and wind energy.

**What Are Solar Panels?**

Solar energy uses the sun’s rays and turns them
into electricity. To do this, we use special devices
called **solar panels** . Solar panels are designed to
absorb sunlight and turn it into electricity. Most solar panels are made up
of many **photovoltaic (PV) cells** . The more PV cells on a panel, the more
energy the panel can produce. PV cells are like a sandwich with layers of
**silicon** and other chemical elements, with glass on top.


These elements are extracted by **mining** them. Mining involves
digging deep into the earth to get useful natural resources, like the silicon
used in PV cells. Mining can be an expensive, time-consuming process
that disrupts the environment. Scientists are always searching for new
ways to make solar panels that reduce the need for mining. Some think


**38**


mining can be improved
to be less harmful to the
environment.

**Where Do Solar Panels**
**Work?**







How many homes and

them? Solar panels work
best when placed out in
the open so they are fully
exposed to the sun. They are often put on rooftops or in large, open
fields. Because they need sunlight, solar panels can’t produce electricity
when they are in the shade or at night, so picking a place to install the
panels that gets a lot of sunlight is important.











The equation is simple: More solar panels and more sunlight equal
more energy production. When a lot of solar panels are placed together
to harvest daylight, it is called a **solar farm** . The largest solar farms in
the United States are in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas—all
places where the sun can be relied on to shine brightly for most of the
year. One of the largest solar farms in Texas is the Upton 2 Solar Power
Plant, which is as large as about 1,455 football fields. This solar farm
can generate enough electricity for 56,000 homes all by itself. There are
more solar farms being built in Texas each year, adding to the power
potential of solar energy in the state.


New technology allows solar energy to be stored and used later,
which is helpful because sunshine is **intermittent** . This means that the
amount of usable sunlight can change often, such as during the winter
or when there is cloud cover. Thanks to this new technology, places can


**39**


generate solar power during the hours when there is a lot of sunlight.
**Batteries** then store the electricity to use on less sunny days. You will learn
more about batteries later on. For now, it’s good to know that solar energy
can be saved and stored for a literal rainy day.

**What Are the Strengths and Weaknesses of Solar Power?**

Let’s consider the strengths first. Three percent of power in the United
States came from solar energy in 2020. This is expected to increase to
twenty percent by 2050. This increase could be driven by the fact the sun is
the ultimate renewable resource that will not expire or run out. Plus, when
solar power is generated, it does not release as many pollutants into the
air as other energy sources, making it cleaner. Another strength of solar
power is that it helps Texas be energy-independent. That means Texas can
create its own electricity without relying on other places. Further, solar
panels also help people keep the price of electricity low. When a Texan can
generate and store power using their own panels, they do not need to pay
for electricity from a utility company.


While there are benefits to solar power, there are also some
weaknesses. First, solar panels can be quite expensive for people who want
to install them. In 2023, the average cost to install solar panels on a house
ranged from $10,000 to $30,000. Most people cannot afford this high price.
Beyond the cost of individual solar panels, generating solar power at any
scale could mean higher prices for electricity since other power sources can
be cheaper. Higher electricity prices means that people have less money to
spend on food, housing, and any other goods or services. This would mean
fewer jobs in the economy and more people living in poverty. Whether
any energy source can be helpful to people is always dependent upon how
much it costs to generate the energy.


A second weakness is that solar panels only work where and when
the sun is shining. While there is sunlight everywhere, that does not
mean that there is open land without features that could block the
sunlight like tall trees and mountains. Also, solar panels take up a lot
of space. Whether a homeowner is trying to find enough space on
their roof, or a city is trying to find enough land, solar panels require
more space than other forms of energy to generate the same amount of
electricity.


So far, we’ve only talked about considerations when the power is
generated. There are also impacts when developing the energy source. For
example, while the process of generating power from solar panels does not
create air pollution, mining the materials to create solar panels pollutes the
environment. Also, mining often takes place in countries outside of the
United States, which typically have fewer rules in place to protect workers
as well as the environment. Another category of impacts we discussed in
an earlier lesson are the waste products of energy production. In the case of
solar panels, the PV cells are currently non-recyclable.


**41**


**How Does Wind Energy Work?**

Have you ever flown a kite on a windy
day? The wind that lifts your kite is the same
wind that can generate power. People have been
harnessing the wind to make lives easier for
centuries. Windmills were once used to grind
grain or pump water, especially on the Texas
prairie. Windmills are the older version of
modern **wind turbines** . Many farms in Texas still
use windmills. Newer versions of wind turbines
can be seen throughout the Texas landscape today,
capturing the wind’s energy and turning it into
electricity.



_**Wind Turbine and**_
_**Solar Panels**_



Wind turbines are tall structures with blades that spin in the wind.
They look like big fans towering over the ground, standing almost 300
feet tall. When the wind blows, it turns the blades of the turbine. These
blades are connected to a **generator** . When the blades turn, the generator
spins, and this movement transforms wind energy into electrical energy.
Just like with solar panels, when lots of these wind turbines work
together, we get a lot of electricity.


Wind turbines used to be more
expensive than they are today. Texans
are helping make wind turbines even
more affordable. The University of Texas
at Dallas has a Wind Energy Center. At
this center, researchers try to make wind
turbine blades lighter and stronger. This
would mean less expensive turbines that
could generate more power.


**42**


**Where Is Wind Power?**

Wind turbines can be built in many places. They can be located
in fields, on hills, or even in the ocean, but they work best in remote
places where the wind blows at least without obstruction. The largest
wind turbines in the United States are located along the coasts, using
the wind that sweeps off the ocean waves. States in the center of the
continent along the Great Plains, from North Dakota to Texas, also


produce a lot of wind energy.


Texas is a windy place. In fact, Texas led the nation in wind-powered
electricity in 2022. That means Texas produced more electricity from
wind than any other state. Texas is also home to one of the largest **wind**
**farms** in the United States. A wind farm is a collection of wind turbines.
The Roscoe Wind Farm, located southwest of Abilene, has 627 wind
turbines. Those turbines generate enough electricity to power about
265,000 homes.


**43**


**What Are the Strengths and Weaknesses of Wind Power?**

Let’s first explore the strengths, or benefits, of wind power. Like
solar power, wind is a renewable resource that doesn’t pollute the air
when generating power. Wind is considered renewable because wind is
caused by the movement of air masses, and we won’t run out of air. Wind
turbines can be installed in almost any place where there is wind that
blows at least an average of nine miles per hour (mph). Another strength
is that the cost to operate the turbines is low. A final benefit is that wind
power creates jobs. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,
one of the fastest-growing jobs in the U.S. is a wind turbine service
technician. However, in many places, these jobs are in part created
because of subsidies to wind power producers paid by the government
from taxes.


Now let’s consider the weaknesses, or limitations, of wind power.
The location of a wind turbine is often a source of criticism. For one,
wind turbines are large and loud. People do not like them placed where
they can be seen and heard. Second, they can also be a danger to wildlife.
Studies show that wind turbines are dangerous to birds and bats in the
air and marine life by coastal wind farms. Coastal wind farms can also
negatively impact businesses that rely on marine life, such as fishermen
and restaurants. Third, for a wind farm to be successful, it must be located
where wind is common. Like sunshine, wind can also be intermittent.
If there is not enough wind, then the turbines will not generate enough
power to meet demand. Next, since wind turbines work best in remote
places, transferring that energy from the wind turbines to where it is
needed can be challenging. Energy is lost along the miles and miles of
power lines, which can lead to wasted resources, including both power and
money. Finally, the wind turbine materials become worn down and must
be discarded. While there is no air pollution produced while generating
power, over time, there is a pollution of the land because a large amount of
waste can accumulate.


**44**


**What Are Batteries Made of?**

Batteries are devices that can store and release energy. Batteries
can be used to store intermittent sources of power like wind and solar.
To make batteries, we need special metals. These metals are mined or
extracted from digging in the ground, just like mining for silicon for solar
panels. Minerals that are mined include lithium, cobalt, and nickel.


There are also strengths and weaknesses to batteries. They are
important because they allow us to access energy when we need it. This
is the main benefit. Batteries can store the energy from the sun and
wind for later use, making these energy sources more **reliable** . This is
especially important for times when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind
doesn’t blow. By storing energy in batteries, we can use renewable
energy even when it’s dark or calm.


On the negative side, batteries rely on mining, which has the
disadvantages discussed earlier. Battery storage can be challenging.
Batteries that store a lot of power can be costly and require a lot of space.
Small devices, like speakers and phones, work better with battery power
because they do not require much energy. Yet, large or heavy machines,
such as refrigerators, water treatment facilities, and medical equipment,
may require more power than a battery can provide. This may explain
why batteries can be useful in moments where power is lost temporarily,
but not necessarily for maintaining electricity for long periods of time.

**How Have Texans Improved Battery Technology?**

Texas has been a key developer in battery technology. Tesla, a
company that makes cars that run on electricity, has built a massive
battery-making factory in Austin called Giga Texas. This factory
produces batteries for Tesla’s cars. The technology could also be used
for larger energy storage in the future.


**45**


In addition to Tesla, there’s more innovative battery work being done
in Texas. The University of Texas at Austin’s Energy Institute has more
than 350 people looking at how to make batteries better. They want to
find ways to make batteries that can store more power while costing less.

**Renewable Energy in Texas**

As you’ve read, there are pros and cons to every energy source. That’s
why we need a diversity of energy sources to power Texas. Renewable
energy helps Texas promote economic growth and energy independence.
From fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, innovations are key to
education, jobs, and reducing air pollution. Still, there are several issues
associated with renewables. To name a few, they require more land both
to produce power and in the disposal of their equipment. Many of the
materials used by renewables require invasive mining, sometimes done
in unsafe ways in other countries, and those materials are not recyclable.
And cost can be a significant issue, especially with solar energy, and
sometimes tax dollars are still used to subsidize renewable energy
sources. Yet, with so many invested in innovations and improvements,
we can look forward to improvements. It’s about using our economic
and natural resources wisely to keep our great state of Texas strong and
independent.

~~**Part 2: An Argument in Favor of Renewable Energy**~~
~~**Sources Led by Texas**~~

Almost one-third of the power Texans used in 2023 came from wind
and solar energy. This was over twenty percent more than the entire
United States. It is time for all Americans to follow Texas and make the
shift to using renewable energy sources. Doing so will help us rely on a
source of power that doesn’t run out. In the process, it will create jobs.


First, relying on the sun and wind for power is a safe bet for our future.
This is because they never run out. The sun shines everywhere on Earth.
Any place the sun touches, even in very cold places, people could harness
solar energy to make electricity. Like solar power, wind is a renewable
resource that is plentiful. Anywhere that the wind blows at least an
average of nine miles per hour (mph), people can transform wind energy
into electricity while the wind is blowing. According to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration, nearly every state has enough wind to use
wind turbines. While the sun warms the planet and the wind blows, there
can be a source of energy.


Second, solar and wind energy offer benefits that go beyond
producing electricity. They provide jobs. People can make solar panels,
install them, or even fix them. According to the Texas Comptroller,
in 2022 Texas was the nation’s fourth-largest state for jobs in the solar
industry. They also projected a 7.5% employment growth for the next
year. Furthermore, the U.S. Energy and Employment Report stated that
Texas had over twenty-six thousand wind-related jobs in 2023. The
critics rightfully note that many of these jobs depend on **subsidies** from
tax dollars. But as underlying costs of renewables come down from
additional innovation by industry, those subsidies may be reduced. As the
United States transitions to more renewable energy production, we will
see more jobs.


**47**


Some people criticize solar and wind power because sunlight and
wind are intermittent. This means that solar panels and wind turbines
do not produce power all the time. In order for solar power to work,
there must be a lot of sunlight and little cloud cover. Similarly, for wind
power, there must be wind. However, new solar panels are being designed
to work better in shade and light snow. Technology is improving the
design of wind turbines, too. They are being built taller to generate more
power. This reduces the need for as many turbines in one area, improving
the way they look and sound. People in Texas are also starting to work
together to consider impacts on agriculture and wildlife before placing
turbines. In addition to these improvements, battery storage can be used
to make solar and wind power more reliable.


People also point out that solar and wind energy require a lot more
space to generate the same amount of power as other forms of energy.
While this is true, there are many places in Texas and beyond that have
enough space to accommodate these renewable technologies. Others
raise concerns about the raw materials used by these technologies and
the pollution and safety risks that come from the disruptive mining that
is required. While this is also true, mining practices, when performed in
the United States, have become safer and less disruptive. Finally, people
raise concern about land pollution that comes from wind turbines and
solar panels during disposal. This is also a concern, but no energy source
comes without pollution. Taken together, complaints about safety, land
use, and pollution from solar and wind do not outweigh the promise of
these new technologies.


Texas demonstrates that the shift toward renewable energy is
possible for all people in the United States. The sun and wind produce
energy that will never run out. As we design materials to generate
power from them, we also will create more jobs across the country. So,
follow our lead, America, for a more stable and prosperous future.

## **the Environment,** **and the Economy**

What do you think of when you think of the city of Houston? Do
you think of the Houston Astros or Houston Texans? You may not have
known this, but before the Houston Texans, there was a professional
football team called the Houston Oilers. Do you know where that
name came from? If not, that is okay—we will tell you the answer soon!
Sports are one part of Houston’s story. The city also has a reputation
as a place for **innovators**, especially those who work to balance energy
production and the environment.

**Houston Earns a New Name**

Houston is proud to call itself the “Energy Capital of the World.”
The title isn’t just for show; Houston has been at the heart of energy
production since 1901. In January of that year, something big happened
at the oil **derrick** called Spindletop in the town of Beaumont not far
from Houston. A derrick is a tall tower-like structure used to get oil
from the ground. Geologists began to think that oil was underneath
Spindletop Hill in the late nineteenth century. When drilling finally
began at the derrick at Spindletop, it gushed oil and attracted a rush
of oil prospectors into the area. It was the start of what became known
as the oil boom. Growing right alongside the number of derricks and
wells was Houston, the nearest city with a port for shipping out the oil.





**49**


Houston has been a center for energy production ever since, and that is
why Houston is known as the “Energy Capital of the World.”


Energy production has always been a key factor in Texas’ economic
success. Oil derricks pull petroleum from the ground, wind turbines
spin and generate power, and solar farms convert sunlight to energy.
From the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast, energy production has been
a large part of the lives of Texans for over a hundred years. But the city
of Houston has a special connection with energy. It is a **hub** for oil,
gas, and renewable energy. Remember the professional football team
mentioned earlier called the Houston Oilers? While most teams use
animals as their logos, the Oilers used an oil derrick as a logo!


While Houston produces a lot of energy, it also has high energy
needs. As the fourth-largest city in the United States, Houston needs
a lot of energy. The **Port** of Houston is one of the busiest ports in the
world. It alone requires vast amounts of energy. This has led leaders
to ask: _How can we create energy for ourselves and the world, while also_
_protecting our city?_ In recent years, protecting the city has involved both
the economy and the environment.

**Supporting Energy, the Economy, and the Environment**

Have you ever stopped to think about how big a part energy plays
in daily life? Oil is used to heat buildings and power vehicles. It is also
a part of everyday items like computers, phones, and medical supplies.
Energy powers electricity that lights up homes. Batteries run everything
from toys to mobile devices. Behind every switch and every spark is
energy! Producing and using energy also impacts the natural world
around us.


Houston’s leaders are aware of this balance. They’ve set goals to
produce energy and protect nature at the same time. For example, when
oil is produced in a factory, steam and other gasses are released. Instead


**50**


of releasing all of the pollutants into the environment, they capture
some. Then they transport some of it and separate it so they can reuse
it in other products. This kind of innovation helps the environment and
the production of energy.


Innovations like this often take place when business leaders work
close together. In 2001, the Texas Legislature officially declared 2,000
acres in West Houston as the Energy Corridor Management District.
The close proximity of energy leaders may explain why Houston has
seen improvements to energy production that also keep the environment
and economy in mind. Many of the companies located in the Energy
Corridor sponsor environmental activities in the city, such as planting
trees and protecting local wildlife. The district also attracts people
interested in joining the energy field. For example, located near Houston,
Texas A&M University’s Energy Institute is dedicated to creating the next
generation of leaders in energy. They have developed programs where
students and professionals can learn to lead and improve the industry.


At the same time that leaders of energy companies try to limit
their companies’ environmental impacts, Houston government leaders
plan for growth with the environment in mind. **Green spaces** like
Buffalo Bayou Park have been built all over the city. In these spaces,
plants reduce the impacts of pollution. In 2002, the city also began a
new green transportation plan where they began to use plug-in hybrid
electric vehicles. These were meant to keep the air clean. Hybrid
vehicles use less fossil fuels than gas-powered cars but still get their
power from electric grids that are often powered by fossil fuels. Even
though hybrid vehicles get some of their power from electric grids that
are nearly 60% powered by fossil fuel, they use less fossil fuel overall
than gas-powered cars. Today, Houston has the third-largest fleet of
hybrid city cars in the nation. Hybrid cars and green spaces aren’t the
only city-led changes. In 2008, solar panels were installed on many city


**51**


buildings. While there are impacts from mining materials for solar
panels, solar energy does not create the same kind of air pollution as
many forms of non-renewable energy. Energy companies work hard
to limit their environmental impacts. However, all energy sources use
natural resources. Scientists, business leaders, and politicians work to
consider ways to use natural resources most efficiently.


Improvements to energy production that involve the environment
can have a big impact on the economy. This is because the energy sector
in Houston drives the local and state economy. Thousands of Texans
are able to find employment in the energy industry. Geologists work
to find new oil fields. Engineers design better solar panels. Scientists
research cleaner and more efficient ways to produce power. This may
lead to new jobs, where people build and then run new equipment. As
a result, the process of making and storing energy has less of an impact
on the environment. Thus, the environment, the economy, and energy
production all benefit.

**Houstonians Lead the Way**

The city of Houston promotes things that ordinary people can do
to help improve the environment. This includes city-wide clean-up days
where volunteers come together to pick up the trash left on the city
streets. The city even organizes a “Bike to Work Day.” On that day, there
is less traffic, less pollution, and more exercise!


There is also a “Lights Out Houston” event, where the city dims its
lights. This saves power and cost, but there is another reason behind the
event: “Lights Out Houston” helps **migrating** birds. They fly at night
and use the moon and stars to know where to go. Bright lights at night
can confuse them. By dimming the lights, Houston helps keep these
birds flying. “Lights Out Houston” began with local leaders in 2017 and
has since expanded statewide!


**52**


**Houston Makes Strides**

Houston has a reputation as a great American city. Nature blooms
in and around the city. More and more jobs are coming to Houston
as companies expand and the city grows. Power is cheaper and comes
from more sources. And other Texas cities have followed Houston’s
lead. The city of Dallas, for example, is committed to the use of wind
energy. As of 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency ranks Dallas
just under Houston on a list of top local governments in the nation for
use of renewable energy. In fact, five of the top six entries on that list
are from Texas!
