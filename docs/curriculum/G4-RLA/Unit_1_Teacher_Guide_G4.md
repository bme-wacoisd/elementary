**Grade 4 | Unit 1**
Introduction


~~**PERSONAL NARRATIVES**~~


The first unit of Grade 4 instruction contains 14 daily 90-minute lessons focusing on reading, writing,

language, and speaking and listening. In this way, students are immersed in engaging with the

written word through reading and writing routines and a variety of whole-class, small-group, partner,

and independent activities. The unit also contains three Pausing Point days that may be used for

differentiation of instruction.


In addition to reading and writing, students also engage in numerous other activities and exercises

to reinforce the unit’s content. These include opportunities for kinesthetic and collaborative learning.

Partner and small-group work encourages student accountability as their contributions become

necessary for classmates’ success in an activity.


The readings we have selected for the unit are all grade-appropriate in content and text complexity.

In addition, the texts have substantial literary merit and represent a spectrum of the American

experience, as they are written from a variety of racial, cultural, and geographic perspectives. For

more information about the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity

of the texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


~~**WHY THE PERSONAL NARRATIVES UNIT IS IMPORTANT**~~


This unit examines the genre of personal narratives, which consists of works of nonfiction written

by a first-person narrator involved in the events being described. Students read three pieces, one

personal narrative and two accounts based on the lives of influential Texans. Students will use these

texts to identify elements of the genre and write personal narratives of their own throughout the unit.

These elements include events proceeding in a logical sequence, dialogue that shows character, vivid

descriptive language, characters with defining traits, sensory details, figurative language, and writing

strong introductions and conclusions. Examining the genre in this way will help students build their

knowledge of descriptive writing.


Some of the genre features are elements students may have studied in fiction-based units in earlier

grades. This unit is unique, however, in that the authors of the narratives describe real events or

experiences. Students make meaning from these texts by learning to read them carefully, improving

their facility in literal comprehension and making text-based inferences. Moreover, examining and

utilizing the features of the genre in composing works about their own lives should help students write


Introduction Personal Narratives
**1**


**2**



with increased focus and clarity, and reflect on, as well as make meaning from, their own experiences.


**Lesson 2**


This personal narrative is told from the perspective of Tomás Rivera, a famous author, poet, and

educator who was raised in a family of migrant workers in Texas. Students will evaluate Tomas’ and his

friend’s character traits and use what they learn later in the unit.


**Lessons 3 & 4**


In lessons 3 and 4 students will read the same excerpt from the perspective of Tomás Rivera. In

Lesson 3, this text will be read aloud in chronological order (the first and last two paragraphs from the

present first, then the memory from the middle paragraphs next). This will immerse students in the

perspective of the author and their choices when sequencing a memory. In Lesson 4, students will re 
read the text independently in the order it was written, with a focus on sensory details.


**Lessons 5 & 6**


In lessons 5 and 6 students will read from the perspective of Clara Driscoll, a Texan known as

the “Savior of the Alamo” for her efforts to preserve it as a historical site. This text highlights the

geographical regions of South Texas and the cattle drive tradition still celebrated in San Antonio. The

text includes cause-and-effect details and dialogue between Clara and her father. It serves as a strong

model for a personal narrative.


**Lessons 7–13**


Students will revisit fundamental personal narrative writing techniques as they read excerpts from

the novel “Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio” by Peg Kehret. The connection between passages allow

students to see how different writing strategies can be combined to create strong characters, a

compelling plot, and hold a reader’s attention over a longer piece of writing. Personal narrative writing

strategies in this work include: sensory details, characterization, similes and metaphors, and cause/

effect relationships.


The text that students will be reading and discussing in this unit provides opportunities for students to

build content knowledge and draw connections to social studies. You may build on class discussions

to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strand of Social Studies Skills from

the Social Studies TEKS. This content is not a replacement for grade-level Social Studies instruction.


**Prior Knowledge**


Students who have received instruction in the program in Grades K–3 will already have pertinent

background knowledge for this unit. Units in which students have been taught this relevant

background knowledge are:


Nursery Rhymes and Fables (Kindergarten)


Unit 1 Personal Narratives


Fairy Tales and Folktales (Kindergarten)


Sharing Stories (Grade 1)


Fairy Tales and Tall Tales (Grade 2)


Classic Tales: _The Wind in the Willows_ (Grade 3)


~~**READER**~~


The _Personal Narratives_ Reader contains three personal narratives. Two historical figures, native to

Texas, are the focus of the first two narratives of the unit. These narratives were fictionally crafted

from each person’s point of view, based on the historical time period and record of their lives. The

third personal narrative that students will read spans 7 lessons, and are excerpts from a longer work.

This text can also be found online or through your local library. These narratives provide the jumping 
off point for many of the activities in the unit, including class discussions, reading exercises, and

explorations of literary devices and features of the genre. The Teacher Guide provides explicit direction

as to what Reader material should be read with each lesson.


**NOTE:** Lessons 7–13 focus on excerpts from a longer work titled _Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio_ .

You may wish to have a discussion with students before beginning the reading that provides basic

information about infectious diseases like measles and polio. The discussion would provide support

for students who may be anxious or fearful of such diseases and a setting for them to express and

communicate their feelings. Here are some basic talking points to guide the discussion:


 - There have always been diseases that can be spread easily among people. Some are very common,

like a cold, and most people do not get very sick. Others are more serious, and can make some people

very sick.


 - Some infectious diseases are caused by a virus that enters the body through the mouth, nose, or eyes.

It’s so small that it can’t be seen. That’s why it’s so important to wash your hands often and try not to

touch your mouth, nose, or eyes.


 - Thanks to scientists, many serious infectious diseases, like measles and polio, almost do not exist

anymore because of the vaccines and other treatments they have developed.


~~**WRITING**~~ ~~**TEKS 4.2.C**~~


A primary goal of the unit is for students to write frequently and to begin to identify themselves as

writers. To this end, students write every day, often full-paragraph or multi-paragraph narratives, in

a low-stakes environment that encourages students to develop their writing skills. In lessons nine


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.


Introduction Personal Narratives
**3**


**4**



through fifteen, students will use the writing process to publish a personal narrative of their own. We

want students to realize that they are all capable of personal writing, that they all have something of

interest to say about themselves, and that writing personal narratives can be a fun and creative outlet.


Most of the writing assignments are connected to practicing skills, such as writing dialogue or

practicing similes and metaphors, that students will have studied in connection with the narratives

they are reading. In addition, over the course of the unit, students will have multiple opportunities to

share their writing in safe and supportive sessions with their classmates. The unit also emphasizes

planning and revision skills.


In Grade 4, students will write legibly in cursive to complete assignments. Students should be able to

use their knowledge of letter connections, appropriate spacing, and letter height to ensure legibility

for the reader. In order to master these skills, encourage students to complete activities in cursive

throughout the unit.


~~**BEGINNING-OF-YEAR ASSESSMENT**~~


The Beginning-of-Year (BOY) Assessment should be administered at the end of Unit 1, rather than the

beginning, to give students an opportunity to acclimate to the school environment after the summer

break. All teacher and student materials are contained in the document, including Blackline Master of

student-facing assessment pages for you to copy. You should spend no more than three days total on

the BOY Assessment. There are three main components of the assessment: a written assessment of

reading comprehension, a written assessment of grammar, and a written assessment of morphology.

Two other components, the oral reading of words in isolation and the fluency assessments, are

administered one-on-one with students. See the Foundational Skills Instruction Appendix at the end of

Unit 1 to support students in advanced phonics.


~~**FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS INSTRUCTION APPENDIX**~~


The Foundational Skills Instruction Appendix is available at the end of this Teacher Guide. This

appendix provides guidance for delivering explicit instruction on foundational skills to target

instruction for encoding and decoding and will be a useful tool when planning small group instruction.

The strategies and activities are intended to be used with flexibility, based on gaps in students’ skills.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available in the digital version provided with

the online materials. This component was created to accompany materials for Grades 4 and 5. It

consists of selections from a variety of genres, including poetry, folklore, fables, and other selections.

These selections provide additional opportunities for students to practice reading with fluency and


Unit 1 Personal Narratives


expression (prosody). There are sufficient selections so you may, if desired, use one selection per

week. Teachers may also wish to use these selections to assess students’ performance in fluency

and expression (prosody). A fluency rubric can be found in the supplement to help track students’

progress towards fluent reading. For more information on implementation, please consult the

supplement.


~~**INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS**~~


Along with this Teacher Guide, you will need:


 - Activity Pages


 - Digital Components


 - Exit Tickets


 - Student Readers

You may wish to consult the program’s User Guide throughout this unit and others for best practices

and strategies on **Supporting All Learners**, including Emergent Bilingual Students, Gifted/Talented

Students, Dual Language Students, and Students with Disabilities. The User Guide can be found in the

digital version provided with the online materials.


**Digital Components**


A wide range of supplementary material is available online for digital display during instructional time.

This includes passages to be used to model reading, sentences and paragraphs demonstrating literary

devices and elements of the personal narratives genre, and sentence frames to guide students in

providing positive and specific feedback on their classmates’ writing.

Support


Offer students some
suggestions for topics:
students’ first day of school
ever, a time they felt very
proud of themselves at
school, something funny
that happened in school
last year.


Support


As students write,
remind them of the
parts of a paragraph. As
appropriate, help students
divide their writing into
topic, supporting, and
concluding sentences.


**10**



1. Start by brainstorming some school memories on the following lines. Try to
write at least five different ideas. Then circle the one you want to write about.


2. What makes a good paragraph?


Writers often organize good paragraphs using a common set of guidelines.
First, writers include a topic sentence to introduce the topic or central idea of
the paragraph. The topic sentence tells what the paragraph will be about. Next,
writers include supporting sentences to explain the topic or central idea. Writers
usually include at least three to five sentences to give the reader supporting
details and facts about the topic or central idea. Including interesting facts
and details helps make the paragraph informative and interesting to read. It is
important that the sentences stick to the topic. Finally, writers end the paragraph
with a concluding sentence, or their final thought about the topic or central idea.
Using these guidelines can be helpful to writing a clear and informative paragraph.


3. Write a paragraph that includes:


Topic Sentence: Start with a sentence introducing the memory.


B. Supporting Sentences: Describe what happened, how you felt, how people
reacted, and any other interesting details you remember.


C. Concluding Sentence: End your paragraph by explaining why the memory
is important.


Do your best with spelling and punctuation—it is OK if you need to guess.
This is a rough draft, -and the most important thing is to write an interesting,
true story. Write your paragraph legibly in cursive.


A Memory Paragraph


**Note:** The Activity Page provides space for students to complete the assignment.


~~**PARTS OF A PARAGRAPH (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Have a student read the description of a good paragraph in section 2 of
Activity Page 1.1.


1. **Literal.** Ask students to name the three sections of a good paragraph, and

as they identify them, write them on the board.


» A. Topic Sentence


» B. Supporting Sentences


» C. Concluding Sentence


 - Tell students they will return to this model of writing throughout the unit.


Unit 1 Personal Narratives


 - Model and work with the class to compose a paragraph about the first day
of fourth grade using the first-person plural (“we”). Include an introductory
sentence, two or three supporting sentences, and a concluding sentence. An
example follows:


 - After writing the paragraph on the board, have students identify the three
parts of the paragraph.


~~**WRITING A MEMORY PARAGRAPH (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Give students 10 minutes to write their paragraph under Item 3 of Activity
Page 1.1. Remind students to write their paragraph legibly in cursive.


 - After 10 minutes, ask a few students to read their paragraphs aloud. Remind
students that all of these paragraphs are examples of personal narratives.


 - **Evaluative.** Ask students what these paragraphs have in common and how
they differ. Write answers on the board.


» Answers will vary but may include:


All use “I” sentences.


All describe feelings.


All take place in the past.


All are true stories.


The paragraphs describe different events.


Check for Understanding


Have students underline, in different colors, their introductory sentence,
one or two supporting sentences, and their concluding sentence.


 - Leave these notes on the board and move on to the next activity.



~~**ELPS 1.C; ELPS 4.C**~~



Challenge

their questions on the board and review them after question # 3. Clarify any
outstanding questions.


  - Write _Personal Narrative_ on the board.


1. **Evaluative.** What do you think of when you hear the word _personal_ ?


» Answers will vary but may include:


belongs to someone


unique to someone


mine


2. **Evaluative.** What do you think of when you hear the word _narrative_ ?


» Answers will vary but may include:


story


beginning, middle, end


telling what happened


a narrator


3. **Evaluative.** How might you combine these ideas to define _personal narrative_ ?


» For our class: a personal narrative is an expressive literary piece written in the first

person that centers on a particular event in the author’s life and may contain vivid

description as well as personal commentary and observations.


  - Define the following vocabulary words:


**nonfiction, n.** a true story


**first person, adj.** told from the narrator’s perspective; “I” is the narrator


  - Repeat the definition of _personal narrative,_ write it on the board and have
students copy it at the top of Activity Page 1.2.


  - Direct students to the second part of Activity Page 1.2 and have them list the
characteristics of a personal narrative.

List three things that make an essay a personal narrative:


» 1. It must be a literary piece.


» 2. It must be in first person.


» 3. It must be about an event that involved the narrator.


Check for Understanding


Ask students about other genres of writing (e.g., diary, biography,
newspaper article, etc.) and whether or not they meet the definition of
personal narratives.

  - Direct students to Activity Page 1.3. Read the introduction and model reading
and responding to the first two memories aloud.


**Activity Page 1.3**


**Reading Six-Word Memories**


The “six-word memory” challenges writers to share a true story just like your
paragraph from Activity 1.1 but using very few words. With only six-words,
narrators must be very careful to pick words that do a lot of work.


Read the first two memories and discuss them with your class and teacher.


Then read the remaining memories. List all the details you can figure out, or
infer, from the six-words the author has chosen. Be careful only to include


**TEKS 4.6.F** Make inferences and use evidence to support understanding.

Support


If students are having
trouble making inferences
from the six-word
memories, ask some
leading questions. (e.g.,
“When does it take place?
Where does it take place?
Is the narrator feeling
good or bad?”)


Challenge


Ask students to determine
if each six-word memory
meets the criteria for a
personal narrative and to
support their answers. Tell
them they can assume that
they are true memories.


**14**



inferences you can support with the text. Consider: where and when does the
story take place? How does the narrator feel? Explain how you figured it out.


1. Snow angels, loving family, hot chocolate.


» The narrator is having fun on a winter day.


2. Snow falling, teeth chattering, keep warm.


» The narrator is very cold and is not having fun on a winter day.


3. Swallowed tooth, morning, dollar under pillow.


» The narrator lost a baby tooth and swallowed it, but still got money from the

tooth fairy.


4. High swings, chain slacks, grass-stained knees.


» The narrator fell off the swings.


5. Wheels spin, pedals slip, hello gravel.


» The narrator fell off a bike.


6. Each year, more pie, happy holiday.


» The narrator likes pie. Pie is an important part of the narrator’s holiday tradition.


7. Moon, lake, camp friends sharing stories.


» At night, at camp, the narrator sat by the lake and talked with friends.


8. Award ceremony, signed certificate, feeling proud.


» The narrator was awarded a certificate at a ceremony, so the narrator felt very

proud.


9. My dog, tunneling through snow mountains.


» Either the dog is short, or there was a lot of snow or both. The dog likes snow and

plays in it.


 - Discuss the first two memories with your students, using the questions
that follow.


1. **Inferential.** Is the narrator a child or an adult? How can you tell?


» Probably a child, but could also be an adult.


2. **Evaluative.** What pictures do you have in your mind when you read

this memory?


» Answers will vary.


3. **Inferential.** What is the same about these memories?


» They take place in winter.


Unit 1 Personal Narratives


4. **Inferential.** How do you know?


» The narrator talks about snow, cold weather.


5. **Inferential.** Do you think the narrators have the same feeling about the winter?


» No, the first author likes it better. The second author talks about teeth chattering,

needing to keep warm.


 - Tell students that when you are writing, you can show or tell. Telling is saying
something directly. An example might be something like, “It was winter.”
Showing provides examples, or recreates a scene or setting that provides
clues to draw conclusions. An example would be, “The icicles hung like
crystals from the tree branch.” Telling may be more direct, but showing is
often more interesting and gives more information.


 - Tell students they will work on showing and telling in this lesson and
following lessons.


 - Read and discuss the next six-word memory (number 3).


1. **Evaluative.** Do you think the narrator is showing or telling?


» Showing. She is using details, but not providing clear facts.


2. **Evaluative.** What is the narrator’s memory? If she wanted to “tell” the

memory, how would she do that?


» She swallowed her tooth, but the tooth fairy left her money anyway, under

her pillow.


 - Point out that if you choose your words well, you don’t have to use a lot of
words to create a vivid image in your writing.


3. **Inferential.** What else can you figure out about the narrator from her story?


» She is probably a kid when the story takes place because she lost a tooth and the

tooth fairy came.


4. **Inferential.** Why do you think the narrator chose to tell that story?


» It is surprising to get your tooth fairy money under your pillow. It is unusual to

swallow a tooth.


 - Read and discuss the next two six-word memories (numbers 4 and 5).


1. **Literal.** What happens in both of these stories?


» The narrator has an accident and falls while playing.


2. **Inferential.** How do you know?


» The first narrator says “grass-stained knees.” The second says “hello gravel.”

If students have difficulty,
choose one word and have
them build their six words
around it.

Ask students to create
six-word memories
from the perspective of
another character in their
paragraph. If there are no
other human characters,
try an animal or an
inanimate object.

3. **Evaluative.** What is the difference between choosing “grass-stained knees”

and “hello gravel” to tell us that the narrator fell down?


» One is more specific and dramatic; the second is a little funny.

Writing 20m


**Primary Focus:** Students write six-word memories based on their paragraphs.

~~**TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.7.E**~~


~~**MEMORY PARAGRAPH: SIX-WORD MEMORY (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Direct students to Activity Page 1.4, review the instructions, and ask them
to complete the activity. Students are expected to write legibly in cursive to
complete assignments.


**Activity Page 1.4**


**Writing Six-Word Memories**


Flip back to Activity Page 1.1 and circle the most important words in the
paragraph. When choosing your words, think about what is most important
in the memory. Also think about what words are most specific or create the
most immediate and interesting picture in your head. There may be a few
more than six, but no more than ten. Write them below.


Now choose the six words from that list that can make a six-word memory
that makes sense.


Six-word memory:

1. What facts, events, and details did you include from your longer paragraph?


2. Why did you choose to include these facts, events, and details?


3. What did you leave out? Why did you choose to leave it out?


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.7.E** Interact with sources in meaningful ways such as
notetaking, annotating, freewriting, or illustrating.

4. What do you think a reader will be able to infer from your six-word memory?


 - Ask a few students to share their six-word memories, and ask the class what
they can infer from them, as they did with the memories on Activity Page 1.3.

  - Use Digital Components 13.1, 14.1, and 15.1 to provide instruction and
practice on determining the meaning, syllabication, pronunciation, word
origin, and part of speech of selected vocabulary words.


  - Direct students to the narrative, “The Power of Words”, and read the first
paragraph to them to set the background for the reading. Use Digital
Component 2.1 to give some background to this text that is not provided in
the short introduction.


**Digital Component 2.1 Tomás Rivera**


Tomás Rivera was a famous author, poet, and educator. He was born and
raised in Texas in a family of migrant workers who traveled often to work
on farms. He grew up to be a teacher, a college professor, and the author
of many books that showed what life was like in the Hispanic community
in the 1940s and 1950s. While not written by him, these tales imagine what
life may have been like for Tomás over the years.


  - Explain to students that it is sometimes helpful to reread, use background
knowledge, ask questions, or take notes when we encounter something that
may be difficult to understand. Have students read the second paragraph
silently.


Words can be powerful. I have learned throughout my life that words can
be life-changing. As a child, I heard words, I spoke words, and I read words.
As I grew older, I put the words in my head onto paper. My words became
books. When I was a teacher and professor, my words became teachings
to others. When I think back to when I first discovered the power of words,
one memory always comes to mind.


**TEKS 4.6.G** Evaluate details read to determine key ideas; **TEKS 4.6.I** Monitor comprehension and make adjustments such as

**“The Power of Words” Questions**


Discuss questions 1–3 with your teacher and class. Write down the class’s answers
below. Afterwards, finish reading “The Power of Words” and answer questions 4, 5,
and 6.


1. What is the key idea in the first paragraph of “The Power of Words”? You may
use your own words to describe it, or you may locate details in the paragraph
that describe it.


» Words have the power to change lives.


2. What words, phrases, or examples from the text helped you answer question
1? These phrases and examples are the evidence that supports the key idea.


» Answers may vary, but students should use evidence from the text. Possible
student answer: “In the text, it stated, ‘Words can be powerful. I have learned
throughout my life that words can be life-changing.’ This helped me to know that
Tomás believed in the power of words to change lives, and he wanted to share that
message through this memory.”


3. Based on the first paragraph, what do you think the rest of the essay’s key
idea will be?


» Possible student answer: “I think that the text will be about a time when a person

shared words that changed the way Tomás thought or felt about a situation and

how that had an impact on his life.”


4. Now that you have read the whole essay, what do you think is the key idea in
“The Power of Words”?


» Our words have the powerful ability to shape the lives of those around us.


5. Based on the text, what are the most likely reasons Tomás Rivera opens his
narrative by stating that words are powerful?
Select **TWO** correct answers.


» Tomás believes that actions speak louder than words.


» Tomás believes the kind words of a friend had a big impact on him.


» Tomás believes that only well-spoken people will be successful.


» Tomás believes it is important to use accurate vocabulary to communicate.


» Tomás believes that good friends are encouraging with their words.


» Tomás believes that correct spelling and grammar are important.


» **Correct Answers:** Tomás believes the kind words of a friend had a big impact on

him; Tomás believes that good friends are encouraging with their words.


Unit 1 Personal Narratives


6. What words, phrases, or examples from the text helped you answer question 5?

Remember, these phrases and examples are the evidence that supports the key
idea.

» Answers may vary but may include: “After Alfonso gave me the book, I felt more

hopeful about working in the fields that summer;” “Alfonso had a way of knowing

just what to say.”

2. **Literal.** What part of speech are words we use to describe things?


» adjectives


  - Tell students that adjectives used to describe someone’s personality are called
“character traits,” and the words they used to describe Tomás are character traits.

if there is a character
trait that both Tomás and
Alfonso have in common.
What is it and what text
evidence supports this?


**24**



(Answers may vary depending on character traits chosen.)


» Hardworking: “tired from working twelve hours a day”

» Intelligent: “‘I know how much you love to read. Maybe if you keep reading, you

could write your own books one day,’ said Alfonso.”


» Loyal: “Every summer, my whole family packed up our things and headed north to

the Midwest. We would work all summer to tend the fruits and vegetables there.”


4. **Literal.** How would you describe Alfonso? What character traits does he

have?


» positive

» honest


5. **Literal.** What evidence do you have from the text?


» Positive: “Leaving is tough, and the work is hard. I can’t deny that. Still, I try to look

on the bright side of things. I feel better when I think about the good more than

the bad.”


» Honest: “I found this book yesterday. It was just lying on the sidewalk after school,

so I picked it up and turned it in to Mrs. Martinez.”


6. **Evaluative.** What is the difference between the evidence for Tomás being

hard-working and Alfonso being encouraging?

» Answers may vary but might include:

The evidence for Tomás is more complicated because we are inside

his head, which means that his feelings are shown more. We only see

Alfonso through Tomás’s interactions with him.


 - Remind students that these two kinds of evidence are “telling” and “showing.”


7. **Literal.** What is the “telling” evidence that Tomás is eager to learn?


» Answers may vary, but students should use supporting evidence from the text,

such as, “I saw books and learning as my **refuge** from the hard work.”


8. **Literal.** What is the showing evidence?


» Answers may vary but could include “I realized that the dread I felt about summer

was being replaced with anticipation.”


9. **Evaluative.** Who is a more important character in this essay, Tomás or

Alfonso?


» Answers may vary, but students should use text evidence about each of the

characters to support their answers..

- Read the definition of sensory details to students. Point to your eyes, ears,

nose, mouth, and hands as you tell students what the five senses are: sight,

sound, smell, taste, and touch


1. **Literal.** What word do you see in the word sensory?


» sense


2. **Inferential.** What do you think we mean by sensory details in a personal

narrative?


» details that describe what the narrator saw, heard, felt, tasted, or smelled


3. **Evaluative.** Why do you think authors use sensory language in their

personal narrative writing?


» to show and not just tell the story; to help the reader visualize the story and
understand the author’s experiences


- Have students take out Activity Page 3.1. Divide students into small groups

of three to four students. Instruct students to work with their group to draw a

symbol that represents each of the five senses (such as an eye for sight, an ear

for sound, a nose for smell, etc.). Then, they should brainstorm a list of words

or phrases that could be used to describe or appeal to each of the senses

(such as _glistening_ for sight, _booming_ for sound, _potent_ for smell, _bitter_ for

taste, and _slippery_ for touch).


- Each student is expected to write words and phrases to complete Activity

Page 3.1, but they should work together to brainstorm ideas.


- Give students a few minutes to work with their small groups to complete

Activity Page 3.1. If time allows, ask a few volunteers to share examples of

sensory details.


**Activity Page 3.1**


**Sensory details** are words or phrases that writers use to describe or appeal

to the five senses: sight, smell, sound, taste, and touch.

~~**SENSORY QUESTIONS (15 MIN.)**~~


- Tell students that they will stay in their small groups to play a game about

sensory details.


- Explain the rules of the game:


   - One student in the group will secretly choose an object that they see in the

classroom.


   - The other students ask questions about the object using details about all

five senses: sight, smell, sound, touch, and taste. For example, students

may ask: Is the object soft? Is it colorful?


   - After each student has asked at least two questions, ask them to take a

guess at what the object is.


   - Have the student share the object with the group.


   - Rotate turns so that each person in the group gets a chance to choose an

object.


- Facilitate and monitor as small groups play the game.


Check for Understanding


Have students name an object that another student in their group chose
during the sensory questions game and describe it using their own
sensory details.

Reading


**Primary Focus:** Students study the imagery in a text by identifying its sensory

details. ~~**TEKS 4.6.F; TEKS 4.7.C; TEKS 4.7.D**~~

 - Explain that in today’s personal narrative, “Sun and Spinach,” some parts

are not written in chronological order. That means it is not written in the

order in which the events happened. This is because the opening and closing

paragraphs feature Tomás Rivera thinking back to earlier moments of his

life, while the middle paragraphs feature events that Rivera recalls from his

childhood.


 - Tell students that in today’s read-aloud, they will hear the first two paragraphs

and final paragraph first. Explain that the purpose of this is to reorganize the

text in chronological order, grouping the events of the present first. Tomorrow,

they will reread the text in the order in which it is written.


**TEKS 4.6.F** Make inferences and use evidence to support understanding; **TEKS 4.7.C** Use text evidence to support an appropriate response; **TEKS 4.7.D** Retell, paraphrase or summarize texts in ways that maintain meaning and logical order

» The story takes place in Crystal City, Texas, on a road near a middle school. It is

very hot and sunny.


**Literal.** How does the author appeal to the reader’s sense of touch?


» “The heat … beat down. It warmed the skin of my face and hands”; “My stomach
fluttered and my heart beat rapidly”; “… wiped the sweat that was rolling down my

forehead.”


 - Read the last paragraph of the text.


I heard the chatter of students in front of the school. I was still a
bit nervous for my first day, yet the spinach fields reminded me that I
had come so far. Before I knew it, I had arrived at the school. As I put
my hand on the wide double doors at the school entrance, I grasped the
handle firmly to keep from trembling, empowered to take the next step.

change from the beginning to the end of the text?


» At first, he feels excited, but very nervous. In the end, he feels less nervous and

more empowered.


**Evaluative.** How does the author show and tell this change from the first to

last paragraphs?


» The author appeals to the reader’s senses to show he is nervous and

uncomfortable. The author also says that Rivera feels “empowered to take the

next step.”


- Explain to students that you will now read the middle paragraphs of the text.

Tell students to pay close attention to the way the author appeals to the

reader’s senses while they read about the past.

y


Vivid memories took the place of the nervous excitement that
filled my mind. I pictured the brown dirt covering my hands as I
plucked emerald-colored leaves during the harvest. I could practically
smell the earthy scent of the fields and the familiar stench of digging


deep down into the dirt. It was both good and unpleasant at the same
time. I remembered the rough, gritty feel of the dried dirt at the bottom
of my shovel and the “clink” sound when I pushed the shovel into the
ground and hit a rock. I could almost feel the smooth softness of the
ripe spinach leaves.


It was impossible to think about that time without thinking about
the intense Texas heat. It seemed like the sweat rolling down my face
would never end. The hot sun made me as thirsty as a dry sponge. I
tried to distract myself by praying and singing songs. Yet, my thoughts
continuously drifted back to a desire for shade and a cool glass of
water. One day I suffered a sunstroke. My memory of it is cloudy, but
I remember my mother telling me a story to pass the time while I
recovered.


**Evaluative.** How does the author appeal to the reader’s sense of smell?


» The author describes the earthy scent of the fields: _“familiar stench of digging_

_deep down into the dirt”; “It was both good and unpleasant at the same time.”_


Unit 1 Personal Narratives


**Inferential.** What do the sensory details in the text tell us about Tomás

Rivera’s memories of working in the spinach fields?


» He remembers his time in the spinach fields vividly; it was very hard work in the

hot sun.


**Inferential.** What does the narrator’s description of his time working in the

spinach fields tell the reader about life as a migrant worker?


» It is hard labor; it is very hot and sunny; the workers get dirty working the fields.


The fields reminded me of where I came from. I clutched my
bag, and I thought about how I might still be working in the fields if it
weren’t for the educational opportunities that I had. My parents’ and my
grandfather’s dedication to my education was what allowed me to get to
where I am today. Through all of their hard work, they encouraged me
to learn as much as I could. Even though my parents never got a formal
education, they did everything they could to help me learn. My father
found lots of books for me to read by asking neighbors and searching
the dump. My grandfather always took me to the library. They wanted
me to have an education so that I could pursue a career that I loved.


I was inspired by my parents’ strong work ethic, and I wanted
to follow my passion. My love for reading and writing took me to
Southwest Texas State University. There, I decided to become a teacher.
I hoped my future students would see that they could be successful in


school, in spite of the challenges they faced outside of it. During my
college years I studied hard and read a lot. I even continued to work
on farms in the summer while I earned my degree. Thinking about the
past and my journey here, I straightened my spine and lifted my head.
That very day, I was following my dreams of becoming a teacher and a
writer.


**Literal.** How did Tomás Rivera’s family influence his education?


» His parents and his grandfather were dedicated to his education; his father found

books for him to read; his grandfather took him to the library.


**Inferential.** Based on the details in the personal narrative, what character

traits does Tomás Rivera possess?


» He is a hard worker; he is determined and does not give up easily; he is a good

student.

Writing with Sensory Details


In the next lesson, you will write personal narratives about a memorable eating

experience involving a particular food. Today, you will brainstorm possible

topics and the foods that go along with them. Then you will warm up by using

sensory details to describe the food.


1. Start by brainstorming ideas for topics for the essay you will write in the next

lesson. Your ideas may include some of the topics of the class or they may be

new ideas. Make sure each topic involves a specific food.


A. Topic:

2. Choose sensory details that describe one of the foods you listed on the

previous page. For sound, you might describe the noise the food makes while it

cooks (e.g., hot dogs on a grill sizzle and soda fizzes when it is first opened) or

the sound it makes when you bite into it (apples crunch). Try to come up with

more than one detail for some of the senses. For example, when describing

what a food looks like, you might describe its size, shape, and color.

**Lesson 4: Sequencing a Memory**

Speaking and Listening [35][m]


**Primary Focus:** Students present a memory to a partner.

~~**TEKS 4.1.C**~~


~~**ORGANIZE EVENTS FOR FOOD NARRATIVE (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students that in Lesson 3, they used sensory details to describe a food

and brainstormed memorable food experiences to write about.


 - Tell them that today they will write about that food experience.


 - Direct students to Activity Page 4.2, and instruct them to complete parts A

and B independently.


 - When they have finished, divide them into pairs, read the instructions for

part C aloud, and make sure students understand them. Then direct them to

complete parts C and D.


~~**SHARE FOOD NARRATIVE EVENTS (20 MIN.)**~~


**Activity Page 4.2**


**Food Narrative Events**


A. Choose one of the topics from your brainstorming on Activity Page 3.3. Then

list the events that make up the food experience. These events can include

what you or others thought, said, and did.


B. Why was this experience memorable? For example, was the food especially

good? Especially bad? Especially messy?


C. How will you organize your narrative to show why your experience was

memorable? Will you write your entire narrative in the past or perhaps switch

between past and present like in “Sun and Spinach”?


D. In this section, you will work with a partner. Each partner should take a turn

being speaker and listener.


As a speaker, describe your experience to your partner. Use the list of events

in part A as a guide, but feel free to add more details.


**TEKS 4.1.C** Express an opinion supported by accurate information, employing eye contact, speaking rate, volume, and enunciation, and the conventions of language to communicate ideas effectively.

 - Preview the Core Vocabulary Words with students before the reading.


 - Ask students if they have heard of Clara Driscoll. Allow students who know

something about her to share with the class.


 - Read the below biographical introduction to Clara Driscoll aloud to the class.


Excerpt from “Clara Driscoll: Lessons I Learned on a Cattle Drive”:


_Clara Driscoll was born in St. Mary’s, Texas, in 1881 and spent most of her life_

_in the Lone Star State. She was a businesswoman who was involved in giving_

_back to her community. At the age of twenty-two, she joined a women’s society_

_called the Daughters of the Republic and advanced their efforts to preserve_

_the Alamo. She paid to_ _**preserve**_ _it, earning her the title “Savior of the Alamo.”_

_Though not written by her, this personal narrative is inspired by her dedication_

_to Texas history, and imagines her life as a child and the events that may have_

_shaped the woman she became._


 - Direct students’ attention to Digital Components 5.1 and 5.2. Explain to

students that these images portray cowboys herding and a food wagon. These

images would be very similar to Clara Driscoll’s experiences.


**TEKS 4.10.B** Explain how the use of text structure contributes to the author’s purpose.


Lesson 5 Cause and Effect
**59**


Support


Using the answers to
question 2, offer students
a character trait, and have
them find support for it
in the text. Alternatively,
point out evidence, and
ask students to identify
what character trait might
suggest it.


**60**



**Digital Component 5.1** **Digital Component 5.2**


   - Explain to students that Clara Driscoll grew up in the late 1800s in Texas.

During this time, land attracted many settlers to Texas. Settlers were

drawn to Texas because they wanted to grow their crops in the rich soil

and open space.


 - Have students read a portion of “Clara Driscoll: Lessons I Learned on a Cattle

Drive” in pairs, starting with the sentence beginning with “The red dirt billowed

out into a **hazy** dust cloud…” and finishing with the sentence “His memory still

lives with me.”


1. **Literal** . What are _character_ _traits_ ?


» adjectives used to describe someone’s personality


2. **Inferential** . Direct students’ attention to Digital Component 5.1, the image of

a cowboy tending to a herd of cattle. Based on the image, what can you infer

about Clara Driscoll’s character traits?


» Clara Driscoll is hardworking.


3. **Inferential** . What are some of the character traits you’d use to describe Clara

Driscoll’s father? Use text evidence to support your answer.


» Clara Driscoll’s father:


protective - “He made [Clara] feel safe” (paragraph 2).


playful - He was playful and silly with Clara evident when he “winked at [Clara]
because he said the same thing every morning on a cattle drive.”


passionate - A love for his family as noted when he discussed Clara’s grandaddy
and said, “His memory still lives with me.”


4. **Inferential** . What character trait describes Clara Driscoll at the beginning

versus the end of this reading portion? What caused her to change?


» In the beginning, Clara was carefree and naive as noted by her casual comment,

“I guess they had to find somewhere else to live.” In the end, Clara was pensive


Unit 1 Personal Narratives


as evident from the text, “I ventured a question: ‘Daddy, what happens to our

memories when we move?’” Clara Driscoll changed because she heard the

memories of her grandaddy and father. Their passion for Texas inspired her to

think about her own memories and connection to Texas.


~~**INTRODUCE CAUSE AND EFFECT (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that a text’s structure refers to the basic way a story or essay is

organized. Explain that authors select a text structure for a specific purpose.


 - Tell students there are many ways to structure a story. One is chronologically—

that is, in the order events happen. This is a very common way, and even when

a piece of writing uses another structure for its central ideas, it is often told in

chronological order. Cause and Effect is another common text structure. Texts

written with cause and effect structure are written in an order that emphasizes

how some events cause other events to happen. This often creates a series of

connected events.


1. **Evaluative.** What do you think cause and effect means? It might help to think

about what each word means.


» Cause and effect explains the relationship between two events when the first

event results in the second event happening. The first event is the cause, and the

second event, which resulted from the cause, is the effect.


2. **Evaluative.** What might be an author’s purpose for using a cause-and-effect

structure in their writing?


» Answers will vary but could include that it is to emphasize how an event started

and how it ended. The cause and effect could show how a character, or their

relationships, changed.


3. **Inferential.** Think back to “Sun and Spinach.” What are some causes and

effects in that narrative?


» Possible answers:


Cause: Narrator’s parents’ and grandfather’s dedication to his education. Effect:
Narrator became a teacher.


Cause: Narrator had a love for reading and writing. Effect: Narrator attended
Southwest Texas State University.


 - Point out to students that the effect in the last example is that a character (the

narrator) changes. Personal narratives are often structured around a change

in character. Sometimes, the narrator changes; other times, the narrator sees

another character change.


 - Tell students that in a cause-and-effect structured piece of writing, the cause

is usually the main event.


Lesson 5 Cause and Effect
**61**


Challenge


Based on what you have
read about Clara’s early
life, how do you think she
felt when she heard it was
going to be torn down
to build a hotel? Write a
paragraph or discuss with
a classmate.


Activity Page 5.1


**62**



4. **Literal.** What is the main event in Clara Driscoll’s essay?


» Clara went on a cattle drive with her father where she listened to his stories.


5. **Inferential** . What effect did the main event have on Clara Driscoll? How do you

know?


» Clara’s father passed on their family’s dedication to Texas. This is evident because

the family’s memories all revolve around Texas. For example, one memory shared

about Clara’s grandaddy is how he fought for Texas independence in the Battle of

San Jacinto. Another memory shared about Clara’s father was how he worked as

a passionate Texas cattleman. These events probably cause Clara to pay to

protect the Alamo as an adult.


~~**CAUSE AND EFFECT IN THE TEXT (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Direct students to Activity Page 5.1. Ask them to work with partners to reread

Clara Driscoll’s essay and complete the chart identifying causes and effects.

Remind students that the main event and how characters change are good

clues to finding cause and effect.

Unit 1 Personal Narratives


1. **Evaluative** . How does the author use chronology to structure the passage?


» The story uses chronology to describe the events of the cattle drive Clara was on

with her father. It also uses chronology to give details about the history of Clara’s

family in Texas.


2. **Evaluative** . What other structure does the author use? How?


» Cause-and-effect structure. Clara’s father shares his memories and the memories

of her grandaddy, which causes Clara to think about her memories and passion

for Texas.


3. **Literal.** What causes and effects did you identify in the text?


» One possible answer: Clara begins by seeing a farmhouse with a missing roof and

smoke-stained walls, which causes her to inquire what happens to memories once

people move.

 - Divide students into pairs and direct them to Activity Page 5.4. Tell them they

reader understands the cause, it is easier to think about what the logical effect

of the cause could be and to make a relevant prediction. Understanding the

genre, or type of text, can help an audience predict the outcome of the story.

For example, a fairy tale is likely to end with the hero conquering the villain.


**Activity Page 5.4 - Predicting Effect**


When you write using cause-and-effect structure, your reader may be able to

predict the effect as the cause is explained.


Try this with your paragraphs. Read the part of your paragraph that describes

“cause” to your partner, but do not read the part that describes “effect.”


After you both have read the ‘cause’ part of the paragraph, try to predict

your partner’s ending by looking over the statements about your partner’s

paragraph and listing your evidence.

includes a cause-and-effect structure.


1. **Literal** . What does _cause and effect_ mean?


» Cause and effect: something happens and that causes something to change


 - Explain to students that the cause-and-effect structure can emphasize a

character’s growth and change over time. This can be evident through a

character’s traits at the beginning of a story versus their traits at the end of

a story.


2. **Literal** . What are _character traits_ ?


» Character trait: the attribute of a person shown through what they say, think, feel,

and do

capitalization, punctuation, and paragraphs for dialogue.


 - Display Digital Component 6.2, Examples of Dialogue in “Clara Driscoll:

Lessons I Learned on a Cattle Drive.”


**Digital Component 6.2 - Examples of Dialogue in “Clara**

   - I asked, “Daddy, will you tell me more about my grandfather and the

memories you have of him?”


   - “I would love nothing more,” Daddy replied.


   - “He sounds like an exceptional man. I am so glad you have those

memories,” I said softly.


   - “Do I have memories living inside of me?” I questioned.


1. **Literal** . Which part of the first quote from the text is dialogue?


» “Daddy, will you tell me more about my grandfather and the memories you have of

him?”


2. **Literal** . How do we know that?


» » Those words are in quotation marks.


 - Tell students that the part of the sentence that is not in quotation marks is

known as the “tag.”


**TEKS 4.11.D.x** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including punctuation marks including apostrophes in possessives, commas in compound sentences, and quotation marks in dialogue.


Unit 1 Personal Narratives


3. **Literal** . What are the four tags in the digital component?

3. I said softly


4. I questioned


4. **Literal** . What information do we find in the tag?


» who spoke (Father or Clara) and how they spoke (e.g., asked, replied, said, or

questioned)


 - Direct students to Activity Page 6.3. Review the rules of punctuation together.


Activity Page 6.3 - Dialogue Punctuation: Five Easy Rules


1. Quotation marks are placed before the first word of the dialogue and after the

punctuation mark that ends the dialogue.


Example:


“I would love nothing more,” Daddy replied.


Daddy replied, “I would love nothing more.”


2. When the tag follows the dialogue, it ends in a period. When the tag precedes

the dialogue, it ends in a comma.


Example:


“I would love nothing more,” Daddy replied.


Daddy replied, “I would love nothing more.”


3. The punctuation that ends a line of dialogue is written inside the quotation marks.


Example:


“Do I have memories living inside of me?” I questioned.


I questioned, “Do I have memories living inside of me?”


4. When the tag follows the dialogue, quotes that do not end in an exclamation

point or question mark end in a comma instead of a period.


Example:


Correct: “I would love nothing more,” Daddy replied.


Incorrect: “I would love nothing more.” Daddy replied.

Support


Tell students to begin
punctuating the sentences
by inserting quotation
marks, and to then add the
other punctuation.


Challenge


Have students write “split”
dialogue, in which the tag
falls between two sets of
quotation marks (e.g., “I
would love nothing more,”
Daddy replied, “than to
play basketball with you.”).

5. When writing dialogue between two or more speakers, begin a new paragraph

each time the speaker changes.


Example:


My daddy called out to a passing cattleman, “John, did you pack those pans?”


“No, Mr. Driscoll. I’m sorry, sir.”


“Well now, Travis, you see any pans?” Daddy called to another cattleman.


“No, sir, not a pan in sight.”


 - Direct students to Activity Page 6.4 and have them complete the activity

independently.

Unit 1 Personal Narratives


**Introduction to Polio**


Polio is a serious and contagious illness caused by a virus. The polio virus

spreads through contact with bodily waste or less commonly, being coughed

or sneezed on. Most people infected with the virus have no symptoms. For

others it results in flu-like symptoms such as fever, sore throat, nausea,

headache, and tiredness. But when the polio virus affects the brain and spinal

cord it is very serious and can cause severe symptoms, including muscle

weakness and paralysis, which may be temporary or permanent. While polio

can infect anyone, it mostly affects children.


Stories and drawings from as early as the year 1500 BC suggest that people

have gotten sick with polio for a long time. In 1789 AD British physician

Michael Underwood published the first description in medical literature, and in

1840 a German doctor named it: “infantile paralysis.”


Polio epidemics increased in the late 1800s, and polio epidemics occurred

regularly in the United States throughout the first half of the 20th century.

Because polio is so contagious, these epidemics were very frightening, and

communities treated the threat very seriously. Swimming pools closed, and

children were not allowed in other public gathering places, such as movie

theaters. In the summer, when polio epidemics were most likely to occur, some

parents kept their children indoors or made them wear gloves.


One of the most famous polio patients was Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In 1921,

when he was 39 years old and already an important and well-known politician,

he developed polio. While he recovered, and worked hard on rehabilitation, his

legs were permanently paralyzed. Even so, he was elected president in 1932

and led the United States through the Great Depression and much of World

War II. During his presidency he created the National Foundation for Infantile

Paralysis, later called the March of Dimes, which raised money to help polio

patients and to research a vaccine or cure for polio.


The March of Dimes funded research by two main scientists. Dr. Jonas Salk

and Dr. Albert Sabin were both working on inventing vaccines, but using

different approaches. Dr. Salk’s vaccine was ready first in 1953. He was so sure

of his vaccine that he started by testing it on himself and his family. Some of

his lab workers also chose to have it tested on themselves. The results were

promising. No one got sick, and everyone developed polio antibodies.

In 1954 Dr. Salk and his researchers vaccinated almost two million healthy

school children. A year later the results were in: the vaccine worked! Over the

next two years polio rates in the United States fell over 80%. Soon after, in

1959, Dr. Albert Sabin’s version of the vaccine was also proven effective.


Both Dr. Salk and Dr. Sabin chose to make the details of their research and

how to manufacture their vaccines public. If they had chosen to keep it

secret, they might have made a lot of money selling their vaccines, but they

decided it was important to share so that the vaccines could be produced and

distributed as quickly and inexpensively as possible.


Today, thanks to vaccination, polio has been eliminated in the Western

hemisphere, which includes the United States, Mexico, Canada, South and

Central America, and parts of Europe. While polio is still present in a few

countries, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria, programs dedicated to

vaccination are working hard to wipe out polio worldwide.

**The Diagnosis Timeline**


As you read _Small Steps_, record events on the timeline below. If there is a clue

in the text about when it takes place, record that word as well.


Some time-related information may cover the entire story. If so, write it in the

space above the timeline.


We have marked space on the timeline indicating where chapters begin and

end. The chapters are also structured in chronological order.


The Diagnosis (Part 1)


- _sore throat and headache, “two days earlier”_


- _in chorus, distracted by twitching muscle, “before lunch”_


- _began with vomit (midnight)_


- collapsed after chorus, “bell rang”


- went home for lunch


- hands shook while picking up milk


- went to bed, fell asleep


- woke up with a stiff neck, “three hours later”


- Mother takes temperature, 102 degrees


- went back to sleep


The Diagnosis (Part 2)


- Dr. Wright came back, temp 102 (before breakfast)


- go to hospital, receive diagnosis of polio


- drove home to pack


- got to Sheltering Arms, fell asleep (later that morning)


- woke up paralyzed

**Lesson 7: Chronology and Transition Words**
Writing 35m


**Primary Focus:** Students use transition words in planning a chronological

narrative. ~~**TEKS 4.2.C; 4.11.A; TEKS 4.12.A**~~


~~**INTRODUCE TRANSITION WORDS (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Direct students to Activity Page 7.3 and review the instructions. Have students

complete item 1 independently.


 - After students have completed item 1, review the paragraph. Then, as a whole

class, brainstorm a list of transitional words and phrases. Write appropriate

suggestions on the board and have students copy them onto Activity Page 7.3

under item 2.


**Activity Page 7.3**


**Transition Words**


Transition words and phrases are what you use in writing to connect one idea

to the next.


In a personal narrative, the ideas that are connected might be events or

moments. For example, in _Small Steps_ phrases like “two days earlier” and

“three days later” are transition phrases that help the story move smoothly

from event to event.


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.11.A** Plan a first draft by selecting a genre for a

 - Then have students complete the activity themselves using their memory

from Activity Page 7.4.


**Activity Page 7.5**


**Transition Words in List of Events**


1. As a class, read the events of “Clara Driscoll: Lessons I Learned on a Cattle

Drive” and underline the transition words.


“Clara Driscoll: Lessons I Learned on a Cattle Drive” (the whole essay)


A. First, Clara describes her memories from going on cattle drives with her father.


B. Next, Clara and her father pass an old farmhouse that had burned down.


C. The next day, Clara and her father have breakfast on the cattle drive.


D. Later, Clara asks her father what happens to our memories when we move, and he

teaches her that “memories live inside of us.”


E. In the end, Clara’s father teaches her about her grandfather and his legacy.


F. Also, Clara’s father teaches her that her memories will always be with her, and she

reflects on how her experiences make her who she is.


2. Now make a list of events for the memory you chose to write about on

Activity Page 7.4. List them in chronological order. Describe each event in one

complete sentence and use a transitional word in each sentence. You will have

time in future classes to add more sentences and details to describe your

event. Try to include at least five events, but feel free to write as many as you

can.

about a fictional masked former Texas Ranger who fought outlaws in the Old

West along with his friend Tonto. Tonto is a Spanish word, which is not very nice

to call someone, but in the show it is a Native American word that means “wild

one.” Tonto called the Lone Ranger “Kemo Sabe”, which is a phrase you will read

today. It’s a term of endearment that means “good friend.”


 - Divide the class into groups of five to read, “Star Patient Surprises Everyone

(Part1),” from _Small Steps_ .


 - Assign students the roles of Narrator Peg, Young Peg, Tommy, Nurse, and Dr.

Bevis. Tell students that they should read the dialogue of the character they’ve

been assigned. The text that is not in dialogue should be read by Narrator Peg.

 - Remind students that when they read “Clara Driscoll: Lessons I Learned on a

Cattle Drive,” they learned about cause and effect.


 - Ask students to respond to each of the following oral prompts by identifying

which is the cause and which is the effect:


1. **Inferential.** The flowers bloomed after all the rain.


» The flowers blooming is an effect. The rain is a cause.


2. **Inferential.** Junior earned a special treat by cleaning his room without

being asked.


» Cleaning the room is a cause. Earning a treat is an effect.


3. **Inferential.** After Maria stubbed her toe, it ached for several hours.


» Stubbing the toe is a cause. The painful toe is an effect.


4. **Inferential.** The librarian piled the books too high, and they all tumbled down.


» Piling the books too high is a cause. The books tumbling down is an effect.


5. **Inferential.** I have trouble concentrating if I don’t eat a good breakfast

before school.


» Not eating a good breakfast is a cause. Difficulty concentrating is an effect.


 - Explain that by describing this cause and effect relationship in her personal

narrative, the author provides extra details about the way she and her father

interacted. This helps readers understand these characters better.


**TEKS 4.9.D.iii** Recognize characteristics and structures of informational text, including: organizational patterns such as

~~**PARTNER READ (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Direct students to _Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio_, Chapter 7: “Star Patient

Surprises Everyone” (Part 2).


 - You may wish to preview the Core Vocabulary before the reading.


 - Ask students to read the chapter in pairs. As with previous units, you may pair

students in a number of ways.


 - Tell students that today’s text mentions that Peg had a teddy bear which was

burned. Polio patients’ belongings were burned to avoid contamination.


 - Remind students that today, thanks to vaccination, polio has been eliminated

in the Western hemisphere, which includes the United States, Mexico, Canada,

South and Central America, and parts of Europe.


 - Explain that both students will silently read the conversation between Peg and

Dr. Bevis through the phrase “anyone could have polio and not realize it.”


 - After both students have read the conversation silently, they will divide up the

roles of Dr. Bevis and Peg, and read the conversation aloud up to the same point.


 - Tell students that as they read, they should try to identify Peg’s two main

questions for Dr. Bevis.


 - Explain that in writing, cause and effect can be used to show a big character

change. It can also be used to help share information or break down puzzles

and mysteries. In the reading today it is used in both ways to offer readers

extra detail about the events and people described.


~~**DISCUSSION (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Once students have finished the reading, facilitate a class discussion using the

following questions:


1. **Evaluative.** What words or phrases helped you know how to read with feeling

and expression?


» Answers will vary, but students may refer to the words like “delighted” and

“unbelievable.”


2. **Literal.** What are Peg’s two questions?


» Peg wonders why she got well when others didn’t and why she got polio in the first

place when other people in her town did not get it.


Unit 1 Personal Narratives


Check for Understanding


Ask students to identify what connects these questions.

» They are both about cause and effect.


 - Explain that Peg wants to know what caused her recovery, or improvement.


3. **Inferential.** According to Dr. Bevis, what causes helped lead to Peg’s

improvement?


» Answers include that Peg’s parents took her to the hospital immediately, she got

oxygen quickly, and she did not have a severe case of polio.


4. **Literal.** Peg also wonders how she got polio when no one else in her town

did. Is Peg getting polio a cause or an effect in her question?


» an effect


 - Explain to students that understanding the causes and effects in a narrative

or series of events can help us see the relationship between those events. This

helps readers know more detail about what is happening in the narrative, just

as it helped Peg understand what was happening to her.

**Diving into Textual Detail**


Part 1: Cause and Effect


In _Small Steps_ author/narrator Peg Kehret uses cause and effect to help her

readers understand the details of her journey through polio. Cause and effect

can help us understand her emotional journey as well as her physical journey.

Answer these questions to help track the causes and effects.


1. Think back to the beginning of _Small Steps_ . What did Peg care about most

at the beginning of Chapter 1?


» Homecoming parade


2. How has Peg changed since the beginning of _Small Steps_ ?


» She now feels closer to her hospital friend than her school friends, and she no

longer worries about things like clothes and basketball.



3.



What makes Peg realize that this change has taken place?


» She gets letters from her friends about their concerns, and she realizes that she

has different concerns than they do.



4. What is the cause of this change in Peg?


» She has been so sick that now all she cares about is walking again and going home

and doing simple things.


5. What is the effect Peg describes at the end of “Star Patient Surprises Everyone”?


» She feels very far away from her friends and their worries.


Part 2: Descriptive Words


The passage you read in this lesson also uses good descriptive words to show

details about what Peg and others felt or experienced. Answer the following

questions to identify the strong descriptive words Peg uses in her narrative.


1. After Peg received the mailbag, what happened to the letters?


» The letters “tumbled” out of the bag.


2. Peg says that in one letter, a “girl complained that her new haircut was too

short.” What does the word _complained_ reveal about the girl’s feelings?


» It shows that she did not like the haircut.


Unit 1 Personal Narratives


3. In the next-to-last paragraph, Peg lists things she misses. Which thing

does she describe most descriptively? Give a reason for your choice.


» Students may conclude that Peg describes fudge most descriptively, as she

explains how she would lick the pan.

4. **Inferential.** What does using “sprang” tell us about the narrator’s feelings in

the moment?


» She is surprised and excited because moving is a big deal.


 - Tell students that verbs that show drama and excitement while helping

readers visualize the action or understand more detail about what was really

happening are great verbs to include in their writing. Sometimes these verbs

are called strong verbs or vital verbs.


 - Explain that the word _vital_ means a few different things, including “lively”

and “important.”


**5. Evaluative.** Why would “sprang” be a more vital verb than “opened”?


» Answers will vary, but students should recognize that it is more active and descriptive

than “opened.” It suggests that Peg opened her eyes suddenly and excitedly.

**All About Accordions**


When you write a personal narrative, you cannot assume that your readers

have had the same experiences as you. In fact, sometimes the most

interesting stories to read were written by people who have had very different

experiences from those of their readers.


Good writers often describe their experiences so well that readers can

understand and visualize what is happening even if they have not experienced

something like it themselves.

Accordions are played with the hands and arms.


The accordion “was heavy and awkward.”


The accordion made Peg’s “arms ache.”


Accordions produce melodies.


Accordions have keyboards.


Accordions have chord buttons.


It takes two hands to play an accordion.


To play an accordion, you have to do several things at once: push the chord
buttons and pull on the accordion itself.


Accordions have a bellows that air gets pushed through.

**Identifying Good Details**


Remember that good writers use many different kinds of detail to help readers

understand and visualize the events described in the text. Use this activity to

record some of the details Kehret uses in her work.


Part 1: You have already noted some of the text’s details about accordions.

Let’s use the chart below to record at least two different kinds of details that

describe something other than the accordion.


Unit 1 Personal Narratives


”The Great Accordion Concert”

|Type of Detail|Detail|
|---|---|
|_what something looks like_|_“He grew red in the face. Beads of_<br>_perspiration popped out on his bald spot.”_|
|_what something feels like_|_playing the accordion “made my_<br>_arms ache”_|
|_what something sounds like_|_“we snickered and tee-heed”; “instead of_<br>_squeaks and squawks_|
|_what something smells or tastes like_||
|_a physical action_|_“she put her fngers in her ears”; “Our_<br>_jaws dropped.”_|
|_a quote of what someone said—dialogue_|_“I want to put in my earplugs.”_|



Part 2: Let’s use the chart below to identify different kinds of good details in

”Good-bye, Silver; Hello, Sticks.” Record as many as you can find.


“Good-bye, Silver; Hello, Sticks”

|Type of Detail|Detail|
|---|---|
|_what something looks like_||
|_what something feels like_|_“feeling foolish”_|
|_what something sounds like_|_a screech of brakes_|
|_what something smells or tastes like_||
|_a physical action_|_“I blinked back tears.”; “I patted_<br>_Silver’s side.”_|
|_a quote of what someone said—dialogue_|_“You gave me a lot of good rides.”_|



- Have students silently read “Good-bye, Silver; Hello, Sticks.”

Unit 1 Personal Narratives


**Detail Drill**


Now that you have practiced identifying good, varied details, use that skill to

improve your own personal narrative writing.


Follow these steps to add to or improve your details.


1. Begin by rereading your narrative. As you read, underline each event from your

personal narrative planner (Activity Page 8.4) in a different color.


2. Read your draft a second time. This time, use the same colors to circle the

details describing each event.


3. Use the text you underlined and circled to complete the following chart. Don’t

worry about empty boxes. You will work on those in the next part of this activity.

|Type of Detail|Event 1:|Event 2:|Event 3:|Event 4:|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|what something looks like|||||
|what something feels like|||||
|what something sounds like|||||
|what something smells or<br>tastes like|||||
|a physical action|||||
|a quote of what someone<br>said—dialogue|||||



4. Brainstorm a few more details and add them to the chart.



Challenge


Encourage students to use
figurative language in their
details as Kehret does in
the phrase “our questions
exploded like a string
of firecrackers.”


Support


Allow students to read their
drafts to their peers, who
should ask questions about
things they would like to
know. Students should

5. If there are any types of details you have not included in your writing so far, try

to add one of those types to the chart.


6. Select at least one of those new details to include in your narrative and place a

star next to the line of your narrative where you will insert the detail. Write your

new detail in a full sentence below.


 - Tell students this is not the last chance they will have to revise their writing, so they

should continue to think about ways to make their details memorable and effective.

~~**INTRODUCING CONCLUSIONS (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that this lesson focuses on the conclusion, or the ending, of a

piece of writing.


1. **Evaluative.** Ask students what an ending or conclusion usually does and

what elements it might include.


» Answers will vary, but students may mention the concept of “a happy ending,”

which resolves conflicts. Conclusions may also show how the characters have

changed throughout the narrative. Conclusions can answer questions or remind

readers of the main point of the narrative.


 - Point out that the conclusion is the final impression the essay leaves with the

reader, so it is a particularly important section of a piece of writing.


**TEKS 4.9.D.i** Recognize characteristics and structure of informational text, including: the central idea with supporting
evidence.


Unit 1 Personal Narratives


~~**READING (25 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that in this lesson they will finish reading _Small Steps_ and write

conclusions to their own personal narratives.


 - Direct students to read “Back to School,” the final passage from _Small Steps_,

independently.


 - After students read the passage, facilitate discussion using the following questions.


2. **Literal.** Dorothy’s letter to Peg mentions her conflicted feelings about

leaving Sheltering Arms. How did Dorothy expect to feel when she left, and

how does she actually feel once she has left?


» Dorothy wanted to leave Sheltering Arms, but once she did, she realized that she

wanted to return.


3. **Literal.** Why does Peg think it makes sense that Dorothy wants to return to

Sheltering Arms?


» The girls were safe there, people there understood their illness, and it was easier

to live there than outside of the hospital.


4. **Literal.** Kehret uses a strong, vital verb when she writes that the girls were

“cocooned in Room 202.” What is a cocoon?


» A cocoon is a soft casing that encloses some insects as they mature and grow.

When they have finished maturing, animals such as butterflies emerge from the

cocoon. Caterpillars are transformed into butterflies in a cocoon.


5. **Inferential.** Based on your answer to the previous question, think about why

Kehret might use this word to describe her stay at Sheltering Arms. What

does this word suggest is happening to the girls while they are there?


» The girls feel safe. Like caterpillars turning into butterflies, they are being

transformed. When they leave Sheltering Arms, they will be different from the way

they were before.


6. **Inferential.** How is Peg transformed when she arrives back at school?


» She feels “stronger”; she is ahead in school; she has become a celebrity.


 - Direct students to the timeline on Activity Page 7.2.


 - Work together as a class to determine new events to add to the timeline. For

each suggested event, ask students to give a reason explaining the event’s

significance and why it deserves to be marked on the timeline.


» Answers may vary, but students should provide a reason for their choices.

Possible answers include, under the category “Back to School,” that Peg returned

to school, that her schoolmates cheered for her, and that, when she went to

chorus class, she remembered first feeling sick there.

Tell students that one way
to think about the
central idea of a piece of
writing is to think about
what a character has
learned or how a character
has changed.


Challenge


What does Peg mean
when she says, “I had
been gone a lifetime”?


» She has changed so
much that it feels like
she has been gone a
very long time.


**164**



~~**CONCLUDING**~~ ~~SMALL STEPS~~ ~~**(15 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that, in this activity, they will think about how Kehret concludes

her narrative.


 - Direct students to Activity Page 13.1, review the instructions, and ask them to

answer the questions.


**Activity Page 13.1**


**Concluding Thoughts**


The _Small Steps_ conclusion comes at the end of a long piece of writing that

is several paragraphs long and includes several events, but it is still a final

thought about the topic or central idea of the text.


Answer the following questions to think more closely about the conclusion of

_Small Steps_ . You may consult the text as you work.


1. What is the main plot of _Small Steps_ ? Describe what happens in one sentence.


» The narrator is diagnosed with and recovers from polio.


2. Describe the plot of “Back to School” in one sentence.


» Peg returns to school and realizes that, although things there have stayed the

same, she has changed.


3. How has Peg grown “stronger” from her time away?


» Answers may vary, but students should point to a place in the text that supports

their claims. For example, they might argue that she has gained strength by

learning to overcome obstacles such as temporary paralysis.


4. Why do you think Kehret chooses to end her book with her first day back

to school?


» Possible answer: Kehret chooses to end her story when she goes back to chorus

class, the place where she started her story. By ending where she began, she can

show us how she has changed.


Unit 1 Personal Narratives


5. Now complete the chart below.



|Central Idea in Small Steps|Support in the Conclusion|
|---|---|
|_Polio has many unexpected_<br>_consequences._|_She has become a celebrity. Everyone_<br>_in town rooted for her. She has grown_<br>_stronger because she worked hard and_<br>_achieved some of her therapy goals._|
|_Although polio made her physically_<br>_weaker, in some ways it made Peg_<br>_personally stronger._|_“I was stronger than when I left.”_|


Check for Understanding





Ask students to share their central ideas and supports from the chart on
Activity Page 13.1.

- Allow students to work with a partner to review their answers to the final

question and to discuss the kind of conclusion they will write.


**Activity Page 13.2**


**Wrapping It Up**


As you know from our discussion, because the _Small Steps_ conclusion covers a

longer piece of writing, it is several paragraphs long and includes several events.


Your conclusion will include only one or two events and will be one paragraph

long. If you feel it should be longer, or include more events, discuss these

changes with your teacher before you write.


A conclusion helps the reader pull the whole the story together.


Part 1: Prepare to write your conclusion by answering the following questions.


1. What events occurred at the end of your personal narrative experience?


2. Why do you still remember this experience?


3. What was the most important thing about this experience?


4. How did you change over the course of your personal narrative?


5. What was the same at the beginning and at the end of your

personal narrative?


6. What was different at the beginning and at the end of your

personal narrative?


7. How does the experience continue to impact you today?


8. What did you learn, or do you think others can learn, from your experience?


9. Now think about what ideas you want to leave with your readers. Look at

the answers you wrote above. Choose one or two and use them to begin

your conclusion.


Part 2: Write your conclusion in the space that follows.

- If time permits, allow students to share their drafts with partners.


- Tell students that in the next few lessons they will revise, polish, and share

Good titles are:


   - short enough to fit on one line,


   - descriptive without giving away the whole plot of the work,


   - related to the text, and


   - capitalized properly.


Answer the questions below to think more about good titles and how you

Activity Page 14.3




 - Direct students to Activity Page 14.3, review the instructions for readers and

listeners, and ask them to complete the activity.


**Activity Page 14.3**


**A Vision for Revision**


In this activity, you will work with your partner to find places to strengthen

your writing. You will also help your partner strengthen their writing. As you

read and listen, remember to think about showing rather than telling by using

specific language and strong details.


Part 1: Each partner will take a turn being the reader and the listener.


Before you begin, choose two of the revision questions below to ask your

partner about your own writing. Circle the questions you choose.


Revision Question Bank


A. Which events were confusing or unclear?


B. Which words didn’t you understand?


C. Were there any details or settings you could not picture?


D. What was the most interesting event?


E. What was your favorite detail?


F. Which character did you want to know more about?


Choose who will be the reader and who will be the listener first, and complete

your part of the activity page. Then switch and complete the other part.


Part 2: When You Are the Reader


1. Read the introduction to your narrative. Ask your partner what they think the

central topic or idea of your narrative will be based on what you read. Ask why

they think that. Write your partner’s answers here:


2. Ask your partner if there is anything in the introduction they wish to know

more about. Write your answer here:


3. Read the next two paragraphs of your narrative aloud. Remember that these

paragraphs are the support: they incorporate events and details to develop

the main topic. Ask your partner the two questions you circled in the Revision

Question Bank. Write your partner’s answers here:


Unit 1 Personal Narratives



**174**


4. Read your conclusion aloud. Ask your partner if your narrative leaves any

questions unanswered. Write your partner’s answer here:


5. Finally, share your four ideas for a title and ask your partner to recommend

one of them. Write your partner’s recommendation here:


When You Are the Listener


1. Listen to the introduction and think about what main event is being

introduced. Answer your partner’s questions thoughtfully.


2. Listen to the next two paragraphs. Remember that these paragraphs are the

support: they incorporate events and details to develop the main topic. As you

listen, make note of anything you would like to know more about or that you

find confusing.


3. Listen to the conclusion. Answer your partner’s question thoughtfully.


4. Listen to the reader’s ideas for a title. Make a recommendation on which title

the reader should choose and give a reason for your choice.


Switch roles and repeat Part 2.


Part 3: After You Have Been Both the Reader and Listener


Based on your partner’s feedback, make a list of three things you might work

on in your revision.


These revisions could be something that you will add, remove, or revise. Be

specific about the kind of changes you plan to make.


A.


B.


C.


~~**REVISION (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Direct students to use their completed Vision for Revision (Activity Page 14.3)

to revise their personal narratives.


 - If students have substantive revisions to make, you may wish to have them

recopy their narratives as they revise.


 - Circulate as students work, providing support and feedback as needed.

**Grade 4 | Unit 1**
Beginning-of -Year Assessment


~~**BEGINNING-OF-YEAR ASSESSMENT**~~


This unit concludes with a Beginning-of-Year Assessment to help you determine whether students have

adequate preparation for Grade 4 instruction. It is administered at the end of Unit 1, rather than the

beginning, to give students an opportunity to acclimate to the school environment after the summer break.


The Beginning-of-Year Assessment includes three components to be administered in a whole group

setting, completed independently by each student: a written assessment of reading comprehension,

a written assessment of grammar, and a written assessment of morphology. The Beginning-of-Year

Assessment also includes two components to be administered individually to students: an oral

assessment of word reading in isolation and a fluency assessment. Explicit administration instructions

are included in this Teacher Guide on Beginning-of-Year Assessment Day 1.


The Reading Comprehension Assessment is designed to be completed during a 90-minute block of

time and will be administered on the first assessment day. There are three passages for students to

read and questions after each passage for students to answer.


The Grammar and Morphology Assessments are designed to be completed during two 45-minute

blocks of time on the second and third assessment days, respectively.


The Word Reading in Isolation Assessment evaluates students’ skills in reading words with particular letter 
sound correspondences. You will assess selected students individually on this portion of the assessment.


The Fluency Assessment is to be administered to all students.


After administering the Beginning-of-Year Assessment, you will complete an analysis summary of

individual student performance using the Grade 4 Beginning-of-Year Assessment Summary page,

found in the assessment section of each student’s Activity Book. The results of the analysis will give

you a clear idea of which students are ready for Grade 4 instruction and which students may need

instruction in materials from earlier grades.


**Additional resources, such as a Fluency Supplement, are available in the digital version**

**provided with the online materials. These may be used with students who need additional**

**support. Students who are significantly below grade level, with significant gaps in letter-sound**

**knowledge, require intensive decoding instruction on their level, ideally by a reading specialist,**

**to bring them up to grade level.**

 - Please plan to have reading material available for students to select from and

read independently as they finish the BOY Assessment.


Beginning-of-Year Assessment
**177**


**178**



~~**BEGINNING-OF-YEAR ASSESSMENT**~~


- The primary purpose of the BOY Assessment is to determine students’

preparedness for Grade 4 instruction.


- During the first day of the three-day assessment, all students will complete

the Reading Comprehension Assessment (Activity Page A.1) independently.

It includes three passages and corresponding comprehension questions.

After students complete this portion of the assessment, use the BOY

Assessment Summary (Activity Page A.2), which you will have collected from

students, to analyze each student’s performance. Please score the Reading

Comprehension Assessment prior to Day 2 of the BOY Assessment, as you

will use the scores to determine which students should complete the Word

Reading in Isolation Assessment.


- Beginning on Day 2 of the BOY Assessment, all students will work

independently on the grammar assessment.


- In addition, you will pull students aside, one at a time, and administer the

Word Reading in Isolation Assessment (to students who scored 13 or fewer on

the Reading Comprehension Assessment, or between 14–16, as time allows).

Administer the Fluency Assessment to all students.


- The Word Reading in Isolation Assessment uses Activity Page A.3 (Scoring

Sheet for student responses), which you will have collected from students, as

well as the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment located under Assessment

Day 2 in the Teacher Guide. A Word Reading in Isolation Analysis and a Word

Reading in Isolation Remediation Guide have also been included under

Assessment Day 2 of the Teacher Guide.


- The Fluency Assessment uses Activity Pages A.2 and A.4 (which you will

have collected from students), as well as the Fluency Assessment text, “The

Elephant and the Ape,” located under Assessment Day 2 in the Teacher

Guide. You will use Activity Page A.4 (Beginning-of-Year Fluency Assessment

Recording Copy) to create a running record while students read the fluency

passage. Activity Page A.2 (Beginning-of-Year Assessment Summary) includes

a Fluency Assessment Scoring Sheet.


- Beginning on Day 3 of the BOY Assessment, all students will complete the

morphology assessment. You will continue to pull students individually to

administer the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment and the Fluency Assessment.


Unit 1 Personal Narratives


~~**READING COMPREHENSION ASSESSMENT (90 MIN.)**~~


Have students work independently to complete the Reading Comprehension

Assessment on Activity Page A.1. After you have scored the assessment,

record individual scores on each student’s BOY Assessment Summary

(Activity Page A.2).


The Reading Comprehension Assessment uses text from the End-of-Year

Assessment from Grade 3, related to the domain-based unit on Ecology.


The texts used in the Reading Comprehension Assessment, “The Cat”

(literary text), “The Wolf, the Elk, and the Aspen Tree” (informational text), and

“Invasive Species” (informational text), have been profiled for text complexity

using standard quantitative and qualitative measures.


The reading comprehension questions pertaining to these texts are aligned

to the standards and are worthy of students’ time to answer. Questions have

been designed so they do not focus on minor points in the text, but rather,

they require deep analysis. Thus, each item might thus address multiple

standards. In general, the selected-response items address Reading standards

and the constructed-response item addresses Writing standards. To prepare

students for digital assessments, some items replicate how technology may

be incorporated in those assessments, using a paper and pencil format.


**Item Annotations and Correct Answers**


**Note:** To receive a point for a two-part question, students must correctly

answer both parts of the question.

Unit 1 Personal Narratives


**Reading Comprehension Assessment Analysis**


Students who answered 13 or fewer questions correctly out of 19 total

questions appear to have **minimal preparation** for Grade 4. Administer

the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment and the Fluency Assessment to

these students to gain further insight as to possible weaknesses. These

students may have fairly significant skills deficits and may need intensive

intervention to perform at Grade 4 level. Carefully analyze their performance

on the Reading Comprehension Assessment, the Word Reading in Isolation

Assessment, and the Fluency Assessment to determine whether students

need to be regrouped to an earlier point of instruction in the grade level

materials.


Students who answered 14–16 questions correctly out of 19 total questions

appear to have **adequate preparation** for Grade 4. Administer the Word

Reading in Isolation Assessment to these students, as time permits, and

administer the Fluency Assessment. Use results from the Word Reading in

Isolation Assessment to identify gaps in the mastery of specific letter-sound

spellings that may require targeted remediation.


Students who answered 17–19 questions correctly out of 19 total questions

appear to have **outstanding preparation** for Grade 4. You do not need to

administer the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment to these students.

However, please administer the Fluency Assessment to determine whether

practice and progress monitoring in the area of fluency are warranted.

~~**WORD READING IN ISOLATION ASSESSMENT (ONGOING)**~~ ~~**TEKS 4.2.A**~~


- Begin to administer the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment individually

to all students who scored 13 or fewer on the Reading Comprehension

Assessment and, as time permits, to students who scored between 14–16, in

order to gain further insight as to possible weaknesses.


- This section of the BOY Assessment assesses single-word reading to identify

the specific letter-sound correspondences a student may have not yet

mastered.


**Administration Instructions**


- Locate the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment on the next page of this

Teacher Guide. Students will read from this copy.


- Cover all of the words before calling a student to complete the assessment.


- Tell the student they will read words aloud to you and that it is important to do

their best reading.


- Uncover the first row of words by moving the paper down.


- As the student reads a word, mark any incorrect letter-sound

correspondences above the word on the Word Reading in Isolation

Assessment Scoring Sheet (Activity Page A.3 that you collected from

students). Also, note whether the student incorrectly chunks letters into

syllables, leading to mispronunciation. If the student reads the word correctly,

place a check mark above the word.


- If, after 10 seconds, the student is unable to read the word at all, simply tell the

student the word and move on. Mark an X above the word on the recording sheet.


- Administer the Fluency Assessment after completing this section and

continue administering these two individual assessments as time permits

throughout Day 2 and Day 3 to the remaining students.

~~**WORD READING IN ISOLATION ANALYSIS**~~


The more words a student is able to read and the farther the student is able

to progress in the assessment, the stronger their preparation is for Grade 4. A

Word Reading in Isolation Analysis sheet and Remediation Guide are located in

this lesson.


The number of words read correctly indicates the following:


- Students who score 43 or fewer words out of 65 correctly appear to have

**minimal preparation** for Grade 4.


- Students who score 44–51 out of 65 words correctly appear to have **adequate**

**preparation** for Grade 4.


- Students who score 52–65 out of 65 words correctly appear to have

**outstanding preparation** for Grade 4.


Unit 1 Personal Narratives


After scoring the assessment, you might find it helpful to determine which

letter-sound correspondences students missed that caused them to score

below the benchmark for word recognition. Note that one-syllable words are

not included in the Syllabication Analysis.

~~**FLUENCY ASSESSMENT (ONGOING)**~~



~~**TEKS 4.4**~~




 - Begin to administer the Fluency Assessment individually to all students.


 - This section of the BOY Assessment assesses students’ fluency in reading

using the selection “The Elephant and the Ape” (literary text) located on the

next page of the Teacher Guide.


**Administration Instructions**


 - Turn to the student copy of “The Elephant and the Ape” on the next page of

this Teacher Guide. Students will read from this copy.


 - Using the Recording Copy of “The Elephant and the Ape” (from students’

Activity Page A.4) for each student, you will create a running record as you

listen to each student read orally.


 - Explain that the student will read a selection aloud while you take notes.

Encourage the student not to rush and to read at their regular pace.


 - Read the title of the selection aloud for the student, as the title is not part of

the assessment.


 - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the selection. As the

student reads aloud, make a running record on the Recording Copy using the

following guidelines:

|Words read correctly|No mark is required.|
|---|---|
|**Omissions**|Draw a long dash above the word omitted.|
|**Insertions**|Write a caret (^) at the point where the insertion<br>was made. If you have time, write down the word<br>that was inserted.|
|**Words read incorrectly**|Write an “X” above the word.|
|**Substitutions**|Write the substitution above the word.|
|**Self-corrected errors**|Replace original error mark with an “SC.”|
|**Teacher-supplied words**|Write a “T” above the word (counts as an error).|



 - When one minute has elapsed, draw a vertical line on the Recording Copy to

mark the student’s place in the text at that point. Allow the student to finish

reading the selection aloud.

**The Elephant and the Ape**


“Look at me!” cried Tusk the elephant. “See how big and strong I am!” 14


“Look at me!” cried his friend Nim the ape. “See how quick and clever I am!” 30


“It is better to be big and strong than quick and clever!” said Tusk. 44


“Not so,” answered Nim. “It is better to be quick and clever than big and strong.” 60


So the two friends began to argue. 67


“Let’s not argue,” said Nim. “Let’s go to Sage and ask him to settle the matter.” 83


“Agreed!” said Tusk and off they ran. 90


Sage was a wise old owl who lived in the darkest corner of an old tower. 106


Sage listened to what Tusk and Nim had to say. 116


“I see,” he said. “There is a way to settle this. You must do just as I say. Then, I shall 137

tell you which is better.” 142


“Agreed!” said Tusk. 145


“Agreed!” said Nim. 148


“Cross the river,” said Sage, “and pick me some of the mangoes that grow on the 164

great tree.” 166


Tusk and Nim set off on their mission. 174


Soon, they came to the river, which was very wide and deep. Nim was afraid. 189


Unit 1


“I can’t cross that river!” he cried. “Let’s go back.” 199


Tusk laughed. “Didn’t I tell you it is better to be big and strong than to be quick and 218

clever? It is an easy thing for me to cross the river.” 230


Tusk lifted Nim up with his trunk and put him on his broad back. Then, he swam 247

across the river. 250


Soon, they came to the mango tree. It was so tall that Tusk could not reach the 267

mangoes, even with his long trunk. He tried to knock the tree over but could not do it. 285


“I can’t reach the mangoes,” he said. “The tree is too high. We shall have to go back 303

without the mangoes.” 306


Nim laughed. “Didn’t I tell you it is better to be quick and clever than big and strong? 324

It is an easy thing for me to climb this tree.” 335


Nim scampered up the tree and tossed down a whole basketful of ripe mangoes. Tusk 350

picked them up. Then, the two of them crossed the river as before. 363


When they came again to Sage’s tower, Tusk said, “Here are your mangoes. Now tell us 379

which is better—to be big and strong or to be quick and clever?” 393


Sage answered, “I should think you would know that yourself. You crossed the river, 407

and Nim gathered the fruit. Sometimes it is better to be big and strong and sometimes it is 425

better to be quick and clever. Each thing in its place is best.” 438


“That is true,” answered Tusk. 443


“Indeed it is,” said Nim. 448


Then, away they went, and from that day on, they were better friends than ever before. 464


**Word Count:** 464


Beginning-of-Year Assessment
**195**


**196**




 - Assess the student’s comprehension of the selection by asking them to

respond orally to the following questions:


1. **Literal.** What were the two animals in the story?


» elephant and ape


2. **Literal.** What did they disagree about?


» whether it was better to be big and strong or quick and clever


3. **Literal.** Who did they visit to decide the matter?


» Sage, the wise old owl


4. **Literal.** What task did the owl give them?


» cross the river and pick some mangoes for him


5. **Inferential.** What lesson did they learn in the end?


» Sometimes it is better to be big and strong and sometimes it is better to be quick

and clever. “Each thing in its place is best.”


 - Continue administering the Fluency Assessment as time permits, throughout

Day 2 and Day 3.


 - You may score the assessment later, provided you have kept running records

and marked the last word students read after one minute elapsed.


~~**GUIDELINES FOR FLUENCY ASSESSMENT SCORING**~~


Use one Fluency Assessment Scoring Sheet for each student taking the

assessment. The Fluency Assessment Scoring Sheet appears in each

student’s BOY Assessment Summary (Activity Page A.2).


To calculate a student’s Words Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.) score, use the

information you recorded on the Recording Copy and follow these steps. You

may wish to have a calculator available.


1. Count Words Read in One Minute. This is the total number of words that the

student read or attempted to read in one minute. It includes words that the

student read correctly as well as words that the student read incorrectly. Write

the total in the box labeled Words Read in One Minute.


2. Count the Uncorrected Mistakes in One Minute. You noted these in the

Recording Copy. They include words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions,

and words that you had to supply. Write the total in the box labeled

Uncorrected Mistakes in One Minute on the scoring sheet. (A mistake that the

student self-corrects is not counted as a mistake.)


Unit 1 Personal Narratives


3. Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes in One Minute from Words Read in One

Minute to get Words Correct. Write the number in the box labeled W.C.P.M.

Although the analysis does not include any words the student read correctly

(or incorrectly) after one minute, you may use this information from the

Recording Copy for anecdotal purposes.


As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider.


It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.

scores. However, a major goal of Grade 4 is to read with sufficient fluency to

ensure comprehension and independent reading of school assignments in

this and subsequent grade levels. A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared

with the score of other students in the class (or grade level) and also with the

national fluency norms for Grade 4 obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal (2006).

Hasbrouck and Tindal suggest that that a score falling within 10 words above

or below the 50th percentile should be interpreted as within the normal,

expected, and appropriate range for a student at that grade level at that time

of year. For example, if you administered the assessment during the fall of

Grade 4, and a student scored 85 W.C.P.M., you should interpret this as within

the normal, expected, and appropriate range for that student.

**202**


~~**INTERPRETING BEGINNING-OF-YEAR ASSESSMENT SCORES**~~


You should use the results of three assessments to determine students’

preparedness for Grade 4 instruction: the Reading Comprehension

Assessment, the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment (if administered),

and the Fluency Assessment. Please refer to the Grade 4 Beginning-of
Year Assessment Summary (Activity Page A.2) and consider students’

performance on these three assessments, in combination.


It is most **challenging to analyze results for students** with ambiguous

or borderline scores. In particular, you may have some students who are

right on the border between being strong enough readers to benefit from

Grade 4 instruction and not having adequate preparation. This might include

students who answered most questions correctly on one story of the Reading

Comprehension Assessment but not other stories, or this might include

students whose performance was uneven on the Word Reading in Isolation

Assessment or Fluency Assessment.


In analyzing results from the **Reading Comprehension Assessment,** be

aware that some students may not be strong test-takers. They may struggle

to answer the questions even if they read the selection and understood it.

You may wish to have students with borderline scores read the selection(s)

aloud to you and then discuss it with you so you can better determine if their

struggles are a result of comprehension difficulties or other factors.


In analyzing results from the **Word Reading in Isolation Assessment**,

remember that not all poor scores are the same.


Students who have difficulty reading one-syllable words may have a major

problem reading the words or spellings in question and need intensive

remediation beyond what can likely be provided in a Grade 4 classroom.


Benchmark results for individual students are not included for the Grammar

Assessment or the Morphology Assessment. You should use the results of

the Grammar Assessment and the Morphology Assessment to determine the

extent to which students may benefit from certain grammar and morphology

skills taught in Grade 3.

Pausing Point


~~**PERSONAL NARRATIVES**~~


Please use the final three days to address students’ performance in this

unit. Use your observations of student performance in class (including

observations recorded on the Speaking and Listening Observational

Checklist) and completion of Activity Book pages to informally evaluate

student strengths and weaknesses and determine which remediation and/or

enrichment opportunities will benefit particular students. In assigning these

remediation and/or enrichment activities, you may choose to have students

work independently, in small groups, or as a whole class.


~~**REMEDIATION**~~


For a detailed description of remediation strategies, which address lagging

skills in Reading Comprehension, Fluency, Grammar and Morphology, Spelling,

and Writing, refer to the Program Guide and the Foundational Skills Instruction

Appendix.


~~**ENRICHMENT**~~


If students have mastered the skills in the Personal Narratives unit, their

experience with the concepts may be enriched by the activities on the Pausing

Point pages described below.


**Pausing Point 1 (Activity Page PP.1)**


The first Pausing Point page contains an excerpt from _Stickeen:_ _The Story of a_

_Dog_, a personal narrative by naturalist John Muir. You may have students read

the narrative individually or in any grouping that is convenient.


**Note:** This text contains archaic/old language and includes words that may

have been commonplace at the time but are not used in the same context we

use today. As these words are encountered, define the word in the context it is

used in the text. For example, the word “queer” is used, which meant strange

or odd. Explain to students that the meaning of these words can change over

time and are not used in the same way today.


Pausing Point Personal Narratives
**207**


**208**



**Pausing Point 2 (Activity Page PP.2)**


- Literal and inferential reading questions about Stickeen.


- Two personal narrative writing prompts based on Muir’s narrative. You may

choose to have students respond to both or only one.


**Pausing Point 3 (Activity Page PP.3)**


This page helps facilitate a game called “Spot the Fake,” which reinforces

writing and speaking and listening skills. Give students a personal narrative

writing prompt (some suggestions are below). Then break the class into

groups of three or four. Give all but one of the students in each group a slip of

paper on which the letter ‘T’ is written. Simultaneously, give the one remaining

student in each group an ‘F’ slip.


Instruct all ‘T’ students to write a personal narrative in response to a prompt.

Instruct ‘F’ students to write a false but believable narrative in response to the

same prompt. After students have finished writing, have each group present

their narratives to the class. Allow a few students to ask questions about

details to try to determine which narrative is a fake.


You may assign a single prompt to the whole class or a different prompt to

each group.


Consider asking students to incorporate a writing skill (e.g., cause and effect,

a simile or metaphor, or some dialogue) into their narratives.


Some suggested prompts:


- Describe your favorite part of your room.


- Describe a memorable holiday experience.


- Who do you admire? Why?


- Describe a time you were very dirty.


Unit 1 Personal Narratives


**Pausing Point 4 (Activity Page PP.4)**


Use this page to facilitate “Personality Transplant,” a fun writing activity to

reinforce the lessons on character traits. Have students select a narrative

they wrote during the unit in which the narrator or another character in the

narrative has strong personality traits. Break the class into pairs and have

partners read their narratives to one another. Then have students write a new

version of their partner’s narrative, giving a character very different traits.


Consider having students present the two versions of their narratives one

after the other in front of the class or a small group.


**Pausing Point 5 (Activity Page PP.5)**


Have students use this page to revise one of their narratives to include more

showing description. If there is a particular Showing skill you would like to

emphasize (e.g., describing emotion through behavior, breaking down action

into moments, etc.), consider a five-minute review of the skill prior to having

students write. Alternatively, consider having students prepare brief reviews of

writing skills to present to a small group.


**Pause Point 6 (Revision Checklist)**


Use this page to engage students in revising and sharing their work after

Lesson 14. Tell students that now that they have responded to feedback from

their peers, the final step in revision is to reread and evaluate their own work.

Direct them to Activity Page PP.6, review the instructions, and have them

complete the chart.


After students finish the chart, tell them that, for the remainder of this lesson,

they will share their narratives with a peer and interview one another. This

gives them the opportunity to speak about their work and the choices they

made in writing it.

_**Stickeen**_ **:** _**The Story of a Dog**_


John Muir (1838–1914) was a naturalist and early environmentalist who argued for

preserving vast areas of American wilderness. He was one of the first European
Americans to explore Alaska, and it was during one of these excursions that he met

Stickeen, the dog about whom he wrote this personal narrative.


During Muir’s lifetime, many people referred to Native Americans as Indians.

Although today some people consider the term “Indians” disrespectful to Native

Americans, Muir does not mean disrespect when he uses the term. Because his

narrative is a true first-person account written in a different time, he uses the

language of the time.


_**Stickeen**_ **by John Muir**

In the summer of 1880 I set out from Fort Wrangel in a canoe to continue

the exploration of the icy region of southeastern Alaska, begun in the fall of

1879. After the necessary **provisions**, blankets, etc., had been collected and

stowed away, and my Indian crew were in their places ready to start, while a

crowd of their relatives and friends on the wharf were bidding them good
bye and good-luck, my companion, the Rev. S.H. Young, for whom we were

waiting, at last came aboard, followed by a little black dog, that immediately

made himself at home by curling up in a hollow among the baggage. I like

dogs, but this one seemed so small and worthless that I objected to his

going, and asked the **missionary** why he was taking him.


“Such a little helpless creature will only be in the way,” I said; “you had

better pass him up to the Indian boys on the wharf, to be taken home to

play with the children. This trip is not likely to be good for toy-dogs. The

poor silly thing will be in rain and snow for weeks or months, and will

require care like a baby.”


But his master assured me that he would be no trouble at all; that he

was a perfect wonder of a dog, could endure cold and hunger like a bear,

swim like a seal, and was **wondrous** wise and cunning, etc., making out a list

of **virtues** to show he might be the most interesting member of the party.


Unit 1 Personal Narratives



**210**


Nobody could hope to unravel the lines of his ancestry. In all the

wonderfully mixed and varied dog-tribe I never saw any creature

very much like him, though in some of his sly, soft, gliding motions

and gestures he brought the fox to mind. He was short-legged and

bunchy-bodied, and his hair, though smooth, was long and silky

and slightly waved, so that when the wind was at his back it ruffled,

making him look shaggy. At first sight his only noticeable feature was

his fine tail, which was about as airy and shady as a squirrel’s, and

was carried curling forward almost to his nose. On closer inspection

you might notice his thin sensitive ears, and sharp eyes with cunning

tan-spots above them. Mr. Young told me that when the little fellow

was a pup about the size of a woodrat he was presented to his wife by

an Irish **prospector** at Sitka, and that on his arrival at Fort Wrangel

he was adopted with enthusiasm by the Stickeen Indians as a sort

of new good-luck totem, was named “Stickeen” for the tribe, and

became a universal favorite; petted, protected, and admired wherever

he went, and regarded as a mysterious fountain of wisdom.


On our trip he soon proved himself a queer character—odd,

concealed, independent, keeping invincibly quiet, and doing many

little puzzling things that piqued my curiosity. As we sailed week

after week through the long **intricate** channels and inlets among

the innumerable islands and mountains of the coast, he spent most

of the dull days in **sluggish** ease, motionless, and apparently as

unobserving as if in deep sleep. But I discovered that somehow he

always knew what was going on. When the Indians were about to

hunt for dinner, or when anything along the shore was exciting our

attention, he would rest his chin on the edge of the canoe and calmly

look out like a dreamy-eyed tourist. And when he heard us talking

about making a landing, he immediately **roused** himself to see what

sort of a place we were coming to, and made ready to jump overboard

and swim ashore as soon as the canoe neared the beach. Then, with

a **vigorous** shake to get rid of the brine in his hair, he ran into the

woods to hunt small game.


**Note:** This text contains archaic/old language and includes words that may have been commonplace at the time but are not
used in the same context we use today. For example, the word “queer” is used in the text which meant strange or odd. The
meaning of these words can change over time and are not used in the same way today.

But though always the first out of the canoe, he was always the

last to get into it. When we were ready to start he could never be

found, and refused to come to our call. We soon found out, however,

that though we could not see him at such times, he saw us, and from

the cover of the briers and huckleberry bushes in the **fringe** of the

woods was watching the canoe with **wary** eye. For as soon as we were

fairly off he came trotting down the beach, plunged into the surf, and

swam after us, knowing well that we would cease rowing and take him

in. When the **contrary** little **vagabond** came alongside, he was lifted

by the neck, held at arm’s length a moment to drip, and dropped

aboard. We tried to cure him of this trick by **compelling** him to swim

a long way, as if we had a mind to abandon him; but this did no good:

the longer the swim the better he seemed to like it.


Though capable of great **idleness**, he never failed to be ready for

all sorts of adventures and excursions. One pitch-dark rainy night

we landed about ten o’clock at the mouth of a salmon stream when

the water was **phosphorescent** . The salmon were running, and the

myriad fins of the onrushing multitude were churning all the stream

into a silvery glow, wonderfully beautiful and impressive in the **ebon**

darkness. To get a good view of the show I set out with one of the

Indians and sailed up through the midst of it to the foot of a rapid

about half a mile from camp, where the swift current dashing over

rocks made the **luminous** glow most glorious. Happening to look back

down the stream, while the Indian was catching a few of the struggling

fish, I saw a long spreading fan of light like the tail of a comet, which we

thought must be made by some big strange animal that was pursuing

us. On it came with its magnificent train, until we imagined we could

see the monster’s head and eyes; but it was only Stickeen, who, finding

I had left the camp, came swimming after me to see what was up.


When we camped early, the best hunter of the crew usually went

to the woods for a deer, and Stickeen was sure to be at his heels,

provided I had not gone out. For, strange to say, he always followed

me, forsaking the hunter and even his master to share my wanderings.

The days that were too stormy for sailing I spent in the woods, or on

the adjacent mountains, wherever my studies called me; and Stickeen

always insisted on going with me, however wild the weather, gliding

like a fox through dripping huckleberry bushes and thorny tangles of

panax and rubus, scarce stirring their rain-laden leaves; wading and

wallowing through snow, swimming icy streams, skipping over logs and

rocks and the crevasses of glaciers with the patience and **endurance**

of a determined **mountaineer**, never tiring or getting discouraged.

Once he followed me over a glacier the surface of which was so

crusty and rough that it cut his feet until every step was marked with

blood; but he trotted on with Indian fortitude until I noticed his red

track, and, taking pity on him, made him a set of moccasins out of a

handkerchief. However great his troubles he never asked help or made

any complaint, as if, like a philosopher, he had learned that without

hard work and suffering there could be no pleasure worth having.

**Questions and Writing on** _**Stickeen**_ **by John Muir.**


1. What was John Muir’s first impression of Stickeen?


» Muir thought he was a “toy dog” who would be useless on an expedition into the

wilderness of Alaska.


2. Find a quote from the text to support your answer to question 1.


» “Such a little helpless creature will only be in the way,” I said; “you had better pass

him up to the Indian boys on the wharf, to be taken home to play with the children.

This trip is not likely to be good for toy-dogs. The poor silly thing will be in rain and

snow for weeks or months, and will require care like a baby.”


3. Quote two examples of similes in the third paragraph.


» a. “could endure cold and hunger like a bear”


b. “swim like a seal”


4. Do these similes confirm John Muir’s first expression of Stickeen? Why or why not?


» They do not. At the start of the expedition, Muir does not think Stickeen will be

able to survive in the wilderness without a great deal of care. The missionary tells

Muir that Stickeen has the skills to survive in the wilderness.


5. How did Stickeen get his name?


» The dog was a great favorite of the Stickeen Native American tribe.


6. Why was Stickeen always the last to board the canoe after exploring an island?


» a. He would get lost on the island.


b. He refused to get on the canoe until all the men got on.


**c. **


d. He was afraid of the water.


Unit 1 Personal Narratives

7. Identify at least two similes in the last paragraph of the narrative.


» a. gliding like a fox


b. 


c. 


8. In many ways, Muir describes Stickeen as though the dog were human. What

character traits would you assign to Stickeen? In the first column below, list

at least three character traits you would assign to Stickeen. In the second

column, support the trait with a quote from the text.


» Possible answers:






|Character Trait|Evidence from the Text|

|_spoiled_|_“. . . petted, protected, and admired wherever he went, and_<br>_regarded as a mysterious fountain of wisdom.”_|
|_lazy_|_“. . . he spent most of the dull days in sluggish ease, motionless,_<br>_and apparently as unobserving as if in deep sleep.”_|
|_curious, alert_|_“. . . when anything along the shore was exciting our attention,_<br>_he would rest his chin on the edge of the canoe and calmly look_<br>_out like a dreamy-eyed tourist.”_<br>_“but it was only Stickeen, who, fnding I had left the camp,_<br>_came swimming after me to see what was up”_|
|_adventurous,_<br>_brave_|_“wading and wallowing through snow, swimming icy streams,_<br>_skipping over logs and rocks and the crevasses of glaciers with_<br>_the patience and endurance of a determined mountaineer,_<br>_never tiring or getting discouraged”_|

9. Write about a real animal (not a cartoon or fictional animal) you have known

or observed that seems to have human qualities. Be sure your narrative

includes the character traits the animal seems to have and the actions that

make you assign those traits to the animal.

pleasure worth having.” Do you agree that no pleasure is worth having

without hard work and suffering? Write a personal narrative explaining why

or why not. Include a personal experience that backs up your opinion.

~~**EMBEDDING THE EDITING PROCESS**~~


Revising and editing can be challenging for students. It may be helpful to follow

the steps below to help your students as they revise and edit their own work.


This process can be done at the sentence level, in addition to extended written

pieces. By using students’ quick writes and shorter responses, instructional

time can be maximized and the writing process will be authentic to what

students are composing.


**Steps for Successful Editing**


1. Model the editing process during writing instruction and target a single skill at

a time.


2. Select a text with errors to provide guided practice in small groups.


3. Partner or pair students for collaborative practice using pre-selected texts

with errors.


4. Provide opportunities for students to practice independently by editing their

own work or the work of a peer.


5. Conference with students in small groups or individually to provide corrective

and informative feedback.


6. Repeat the process by modeling a new grammar or convention skill.


**Last, but not least...**


 - Start with single sentences before moving onto longer pieces of writing.


 - Explicit grammar lessons can be reinforced using a variety of texts. Use

sentences from Read-Aloud or Student Reader texts to use as mentor

sentences.


 - Have students apply their understanding of a targeted skill in their short and

extended constructed responses.


 - Provide rehearsal opportunities during collaborative and independent writing

time.


 - Grammar is best taught in the context of student writing.


 - Incorporate spelling practice including use of high frequency words in written

compositions.

|4.11.D.i|complete, simple, and<br>compound sentences<br>with subject-verb<br>agreement and<br>avoidance of splices,<br>run-on, and fragments|Begin by focusing on simple sentences before moving onto<br>compound sentences. Take one skill at a time (i.e., subject-verb<br>agreement) and provide students with pre-selected text with those<br>errors. Once students are ready, move onto compound sentences.<br>Repeat the process with splices, run-ons, and fragments. Have<br>students engage in peer editing or independent editing.

|4.11.D.v|adverbs that convey<br>frequency and adverbs<br>that convey degree|Target common errors in adverb usage such as<br>• Incorrect placement of adverbs (e.g., “She quickly ran”<br>instead of “She ran quickly”).<br>• Overuse or misuse of adverbs (e.g., redundant adverbs like<br>“very quickly”).<br>• Missing adverbs where clarification or emphasis is needed.<br>Model the correct usage of adverbs during writing instruction<br>and encourage students to use adverbs in written responses.<br>Collect responses and use one of the student’s written pieces to<br>edit as a class.<br>|
|4.11.D.vi|prepositions and<br>prepositional phrases|Common errors include:<br>• Incorrect preposition usage (e.g., “She is in the home”<br>instead of “She is at home”).<br>• Incorrect prepositional phrase placement or structure.<br>• Missing or unnecessary prepositions.<br>After teaching students about the function and use of<br>preposition and prepositional phrases, have them notice them<br>in the texts they are reading. As editing practice, have students<br>take turns reading their written piece aloud to a partner.<br>The partner will listen for the incorrect usage and, together,<br>students can edit the sentence to make it correct.|
|4.11.D.vii|pronouns, including<br>reflexive|Provide sentences with subject-object relationships or with<br>multiple instances of reflexive pronouns. Engage students in<br>a class discussion about the errors and how to correct them.<br>Provide students with opportunities to edit their own pieces for<br>the correct usage of reflexive pronouns.|

|4.11.D.viii|coordinating<br>conjunctions to form<br>compound subjects,<br>predicates, and<br>sentences|Provide students with stems that have different coordinating<br>conjunctions. For example, Cooking is rewarding because…<br>Cooking is rewarding, but…Cooking is rewarding, so… This is<br>a fun activity to tie to content students are currently learning<br>about because it can serve as a check for understanding for<br>comprehension.

|4.11.D.x|punctuation marks<br>including apostrophes<br>in possessives,<br>commas in compound<br>sentences, and<br>quotation marks in<br>dialogue|Refer to specific lessons that address punctuation marks and<br>ensure students have an opportunity to edit for apostrophes<br>in possessives, as this is a challenging skill, especially when<br>working with plurals. Dialogue is also a bit tricky, so providing<br>students with mentor sentences for punctuation is helpful.<br>As always, have students use writing that they are currently<br>working on to edit for this skill.|
|4.11.D.xi|correct spelling<br>of words with<br>grade appropriate<br>orthographic patterns<br>and rules and high-<br>frequency words|Incorporate editing for correct spelling using skills that are<br>presented in the spelling lessons for each unit. After a pattern<br>has been addressed, draw students’ attention to that pattern<br>and include that as a part of the “editing for spelling” in the<br>editing checklist. For example, if students are working with<br>multisyllabic words with final stable syllables (generation, etc.),<br>then the editing for spelling target can be that particular skill.<br>Continually bring students’ attention to the high frequency<br>words they encounter in texts.|

Foundational Skills Instruction
Appendix


**Introduction**


Students who have progressed through the program in grades K-3 have received explicit, systematic,

direct phonics instruction. In alignment with the grade-level TEKS, students in grade 4 are expected

apply their advanced phonics knowledge in reading and writing tasks.  Within the materials,

instruction is presented systematically. Lessons are broken down to have students engage in

vocabulary, word work, and spelling activities to prior to reading complex texts and composing

written pieces. Students will be expected to decode multisyllabic words and utilize morphology and

information about the meaning, pronunciation, and parts of speech of words gained from knowledge

of prefixes, roots, and suffixes. This will help students learn to spell and read more challenging

phoneme-grapheme correspondences. It can also help students learn to use context to confirm or

self-correct their word recognition and understanding.


This appendix will provide guidance for delivering explicit instruction on foundational skills to target

instruction for encoding and decoding and will be a useful tool when planning small group instruction.

After administering the beginning-of-year assessment, you may determine that students need

additional support and practice based on gaps in students’ phonics skills. The strategies and activities

are intended to be used with flexibility, given that students have already had explicit instruction on all

syllable types, division patterns and spelling patterns.


In each of the units, students will have the opportunity reinforce knowledge gained in grades K-3 to:


 - Spell more challenging phoneme-grapheme correspondences


 - Understand the six syllable types


 - Read, write, and spell multisyllabic words


 - Understand division principles to read and spell multisyllabic words


 - Read and spell inflectional suffixes


 - Read and spell common prefixes and Latin roots


 - Read and spell words with irregular past tense and plurals


In each unit, students are presented with vocabulary words, spelling words, and targeted words for

word work. These words come from the texts that students will be reading. If necessary, please use the

instructional strategies provided to target instruction for encoding and decoding, including syllable

division patterns and syllable types.

1, 5, 6, 10 Spelling words using
knowledge of suffixes,
including how they can change
base words such as dropping
e, changing y to i, and doubling
final consonants (4.2.B.vi)


**Routines**




- Remind students that we change the y to I when the last letter of the
word is y, and we want to add a suffix like -ed or -est or make it plural by
adding -es to the end of the word.

- We can remember this rule by saying, “Change the y to i and the ending.”
(Example: rely + ed = relied, busy + est =busiest, try + s = tries.

- Remind students to use this rule is to look at the letter that comes
before the y in the word. If a vowel comes before the y, keep the y and
add the suffix (play + ed = played). If a consonant comes before the
y, change the y to I and add the suffix (carry + ed = carried). If the
suffix begins with an i (ing), keep the y and add the suffix (play + ing =
playing)

- Provide students with a variety of words and have them practice
applying this spelling rule.

**246**



**Sample Explicit Foundational Skills Routine**


**Review,** 3-5 minutes


- Review previously learned concepts


**Teach New,** 5 minutes


- Directly teach the new pattern using straight-forward language


- If not new, spend additional time reviewing the concept being taught


- Spend time reviewing sound-spelling patterns orally before encoding and decoding


**Encoding/Decoding,** 10 minutes


_The goal is to have students read and write (spelling & handwriting) while applying the targeted_

_concept. Work from least complex to most complex by providing practice with words in isolation,_

_phrases, sentences, and then in connected text._


- Decoding:


   - Write a word that follows the pattern on the board

   - Underline the vowel sound in a word

   - Have students read the word

   - Repeat (4-5 words)

   - Options: over the week, gradually release responsibility to students or student leaders


- Encoding:


   - Dictate a word that follows the pattern

   - Students repeat the word

   - Students write the word in cursive

   - Repeat (4-5 words)

   - Dictate a phrase containing the pattern and any concepts that need review

   - Students repeat the phrase

   - Students write the phrase in cursive

   - Dictate a sentence containing the pattern and any concepts that need review

   - Students repeat the sentence

   - Students write the sentence in cursive

   - Prompt students to check their pattern spelling and letter formation. In addition, prompt to apply

capitalization and punctuation.


Unit 1 Personal Narratives


**Connected Text,** 5 min


- Present text that contains the pattern. This can be a grade-level text, a poem, or a sentence. Remind

students to look for the targeted pattern and apply what they have learned. Circulate and provide

corrective and informative feedback as necessary.


**Differentiated Supports**


Morphological Scaffolding Supports


**Word Reading: If a student cannot decode a word, syllabicate the word before identifying**

**prefix, suffix and base word.**


Example: ASTONISHMENT


Sample Script: We need to syllabicate this word to help us read it. I see the suffix _–ment_ at the end. I

will start by circling this and putting suffix at the top and label it. Next, I need to identify my vowels. I

see vowels _a_, _o_, and _i_ . In between _a_ and _o_, I see consonants _s_ and _t_ . This is a VCCV pattern. I will divide

between the two consonants. The first syllable is a closed syllable, which is a short vowel sound, and

the second syllable is also a closed syllable. The first syllable is /as/, second syllable is /ton/, the third

syllable is /ish/and suffix is /ment/. The whole word is astonishment.











**Word Part Identification: Allow students to try identifying word parts without labeling each**

**part. If extra support is needed, have students label the word parts.**


EXAMPLE: CONSTRUCTION


Sample Script: We can label each part to remind us of what the word parts are. I know that _inter-_ is a

prefix. I will underline the prefixes and write the prefixes above it. I know that – _ion_ is a suffix, and we

circle suffixes. I will circle it and write suffix above it. _rupt_ is a base word, so I will draw a box around it.

_rupt_ is a bound base, so I will write BB above it to remind me that it is a bound base.
