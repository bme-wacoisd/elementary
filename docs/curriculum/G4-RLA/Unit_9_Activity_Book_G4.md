**“The Story of Oil”**


**Banana Shopping**

Suppose you and your grandmother get on the bus,
and you go to the supermarket. All kinds of fruits are on
sale there, including bananas. You pick up a bunch, along
with flour, butter, and eggs. Then you take the bus home,
and you make your banana bread.


**Banana Travels**

What does baking banana bread have to do with the
story of **oil** ? Well, have you ever asked yourself where
bananas come from? In much of the United States, the
answer is: somewhere else! We grow a few bananas in the
United States, but most of them come to us from Asia and
South America.


**The Formation of Oil**

Have you ever stopped to think about how the food we
eat is grown? In order for bananas to grow, they must go
through a process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is
the process of using energy from sunlight to create food.
All plants, algae, and some microorganisms require this
process to live and grow. Photosynthetic organisms live on
land and in water. Once the bananas are grown on farms in
South America and Asia, we use boats to transport them
to the United States. It’s a long way from there to here. If
we didn’t have boats that could make the trip fast enough,
all the bananas would spoil, or become unhealthy to eat.
There’d be no banana bread for anyone.

To get the speed they need, the people who make
boat engines use a special source of **fuel** . Fuel is any kind
of material that releases **energy** when you burn it. (For
example, when you make a campfire, the wood you burn
is the campfire’s fuel.) One kind of fuel in boat engines—
and in many kinds of engines, in fact!—is called oil.
(There are other kinds of oils besides the kind we burn
in engines, like olive oil or vegetable oil. The kind of
oil in engines is a fluid based on **petroleum** .) When it
burns inside an engine, it releases gas that pushes up and
down on a part called a **piston** . When the piston pumps,
it starts to turn the gears of the engine very fast. And


**World Without Oil**

Our world would be very different without oil. In the
days before oil, it really was very different! People ate a less
**diversified** diet, and traveled less, and worked in different
ways. Before oil, you might never have met anyone from
outside your hometown, unless you made a very special

In this unit, we’ll answer some of these questions. We’ll look at how the energy stored in
oil goes all the way back to the sun, which provides energy to all living organisms through the
food chain that starts with photosynthesis. Over time, these living organisms died and were
sealed underground. There, their bodies broke down and were slowly transformed into the
oil we burn. Did you know that when buried for a long time, under high heat and pressure,
organisms break down into a chemical called **carbon** ? Carbon is the building block of life.
Forms of carbon make up all plants and animals, including the human body. It is also the main
ingredient in oil.



**Spindletop**

We’ll also look at one of the most important
discoveries of oil in modern times. That discovery
happened in Texas with an **oil well**, a hole dug in the
ground to extract oil, called Spindletop, in a city called
Beaumont. People had discovered oil before in many
places around the world, but the Spindletop well was just
the start of a huge supply of oil, and all of it was coming
from Texas. Oil was useful to many businesses for all the
reasons we talked about and others we will learn about,
and that made it **valuable**, or something people wanted
to pay a lot of money for. Soon lots of oil was flowing out
of Texas, and lots of money was flowing back into it.


The oil business made Texas one of the richest states

The oil **industry** also attracted many immigrants from countries like Cambodia, Vietnam,
India, Pakistan, and Iran. All these people brought their music and cultural traditions with
them, too. With so many traditions and people all in the same place, talking to one another
and learning from one another, Houston became a **cosmopolitan** city, a city with a culture
that traveled the entire world.


That’s all part of the story of oil. And the story is still

**Texas Energy: Variety Is the Spice of Life**

Imagine what life would be like if you could only eat one type of food. You might realize
that variety is important! From barbeque to international cuisine, many Texans enjoy diverse
flavors and spices. In addition to food, Texas is also diverse in another important way: energy
sources. Texas has a variety of natural resources available and an innovative energy industry,
which makes the state a leader in energy production.

**Texas’ Unique Geography**

Texas’ unique geographic diversity gives it an advantage because of the many natural
resources that are available. Data from the U.S. Geological Survey shows that Texas has greater
diversity of land cover, or types of land, compared to nearly all other U.S. states. The state has
forests, plains, mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, and a long coastline. This diversity provides
many different natural resources.

**A Variety of Natural Resources**

Many of Texas’ natural resources are used for energy production, which provides things
like electricity, heat, and fuel throughout the state. Oil and natural gas reserves, coal, sun,
wind, and uranium—which is used to produce nuclear energy—are all naturally available
in Texas. Texans harness, or make use of, the power of fossil fuels—like oil and gas—as well
as renewable resources—like wind and solar power. This diverse energy mix is important
because it provides multiple energy sources to rely on.

All energy sources have strengths and weaknesses. Using a variety of energy sources means
that one source’s strengths can balance out another’s weaknesses. For example, a strength of
solar power is that it uses the sun as a natural resource which, unlike other fuel types, will never
expire or run out. However, one weakness of solar power is that the panels used to capture and
the batteries used to store the sun’s energy are made of materials that can run out. Also, if a state
were to rely only on solar power, that state might be at risk of power shortages during less sunny
times. Plus, the state would have to spend a lot of money to store the energy once it is produced,
to save for less sunny days. Relying solely on solar power would mean that there would be times
when there would not be enough energy to power the things people use in their daily lives. There
is a lower risk of power shortages when energy can be harnessed from multiple sources. Lastly,
because of the abundant natural resources and diverse energy sources that are produced, Texans
have access to reliable energy without depending on other states or countries.

**Innovations Harness the Power of Natural Resources**

Although the natural resources available in Texas give the state an advantage, these
natural resources do not create usable energy on their own. The power of natural
resources must be harnessed and turned into usable energy. First, people must modify
the environment to obtain natural resources. This includes extracting oil and gas or
installing windmills and solar panels. Then, the natural resources must be processed, or
converted into a useful form. For example, oil refineries process crude oil, transforming
it into many different products that can be used for several purposes, such as
transportation, heating, and even food preservation.

Texas’ strong energy industry works to develop new innovations that improve energy
production. Innovations are new inventions or ideas that are created for a purpose.
Innovations can solve problems within the energy industry and lead to new opportunities
in energy. Let’s consider the Texas of the past as an example. According to the Texas
State Historical Association, many parts of Texas could not be permanently settled
until the mid-1850s because they were too far from a natural water source. At that time,
innovations in the design of windmills allowed Texans to access water deep underground.
This helped drive the modernization, or development, of those areas. With greater
access to water, railroads could more easily power their steam engines, making travel to
these parts of Texas easier. Today, new developments continue to solve energy problems
in Texas, such as making energy more reliable, reducing environmental impacts, and
lowering costs. For example, scientists and engineers are investigating the idea of mixing
hydrogen with natural gas to create a mixture that will burn cleaner. As leaders work
to improve energy production, the energy industry is constantly changing. This neverending cycle of innovation keeps the energy industry in Texas strong.

Texas’ diverse energy mix is a result of the variety of natural resources available
and the innovations of the energy industry. The unique geography of the state provides
many different types of energy resources, while innovations harness their power.
Which do you think is more important: the variety of natural resources available or the
innovations created to harness and produce energy?

**An Argument in Favor of Natural Gas Led by Texas**


Our modern world runs on energy, and the need for it increases with demand.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, energy use in America alone
increased more than eight times from 1900 to 2011. Energy is used in industries such as
farming, transportation, and technology, and is key for their success. One essential source
of energy is natural gas, a resource that is abundant in Texas. The production and use of
natural gas from Texas as the leading source of energy is critical to meet these increasing
demands and ensure America’s future.

First, natural gas is critical to meet America’s increasing energy demands because it can
provide the large supply of energy needed to power our lives. Did you know that in 2011,
natural gas was used more than any other source in America? It provided 30 percent of
the total energy needed. Natural gas is extracted from shale, a type of sedimentary rock.
There are large shale formations throughout Texas that hold enormous amounts of natural
gas. Recent innovations in drilling techniques have enabled access to these large reserves,
increasing the supply of energy available in Texas. It makes sense to use natural gas because
of its abundance and its ability to meet the increasing demands for energy.

Another reason to use natural gas is that it has fewer environmental risks than other
sources of energy. It is true that using natural gas requires drilling and releases some
pollutants; however, the next-largest source of energy used to produce electricity is coal,
which requires harmful and dangerous mining and releases more significant amounts
of pollution. For example, today China uses coal as its primary energy source, leading to
significant air pollution problems in that country. Other forms of energy used to generate
electricity, such as wind and solar, generate less air pollution, but these sources also require
mining and large tracts of land. Lastly, because their materials cannot be recycled, these
sources still have some negative environmental impacts. (It should be noted that America
has regulations that make working in mines safer and cleaner than other parts of the world.)

The third major advantage of using natural gas is its reliability. Wind and solar power
can only generate power when the wind is blowing or when the sun is shining. Also, there’s
a limit to the amount of energy from wind and solar that can be stored by the technology
of today’s electric companies. Because people need a constant and reliable source of energy,


Unit 9 Innovation and Industry in Energy
**23**


**Activity Page**
## **3.2**



NAME:


DATE:



natural gas is the best solution. It is a dependable energy source because it can be
consistently obtained from shale deposits all over Texas. Power plants are then
able to generate energy 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Moreover,
innovations have already improved the ability to store fuel and generate electricity
from natural gas. As a result, energy production can easily be increased and
decreased to match demand, making it available when it is needed.

To sum it up, using natural gas as a core source of energy is key to maintaining
our modern quality of life. The natural gas supplied by Texas provides the
large amounts of energy we need. Natural gas is more reliable and has fewer
environmental risks than other energy sources. Texas can even export natural gas
to other countries, helping improve the quality of life for people around the world.
The next time you play outside under the lights, power up a computer, or visit the
doctor’s office, remember the critical role natural gas plays in powering your life!

Directions: Read the argumentative essay below. Label each paragraph with the correct part
of the essay. Use the model on Activity Page 3.2 that you labeled in class to help you.


Getting a pet is a big decision. Which kind of animal to
get is an easy decision. Dogs make the best pets for anyone
who wants an animal pal.

Dogs come in many sizes, shapes, and personalities.
There is a dog for every person. Not only will they give
you endless love and companionship, they are fun! Dogs
can learn all kinds of tricks. Having a dog will also make
you healthier because you will exercise each time they
need a walk.

Lots of parents try to say that a dog is not a good idea
for a pet. They say that it is too big. Well, good news! Some
dog breeds are so small they can fit in a purse. Allergies
are another worry. There are breeds of dog that have hair
instead of fur and are great for people who get the sniffles
from other furry pets, like cats.

Another reason why dogs make such great pets is
because they are loyal. A dog is often referred to as ‘man’s
best friend’ and will love their owner no matter what. While
some breeds might be more loyal than others, dogs won’t
hold it against you if you feed them late or are away from
home longer than you planned. Dogs and their owners bond
and develop a loyal relationship

If you want to be happy and healthy, you should get a
dog. You will take plenty of walks and get a ton of cuddles
every day. Dogs are by far the best pets.

**Primary and Secondary Sources**

When researchers are collecting information, they often use primary sources. A primary
source comes from a person who knows about a topic firsthand. These sources provide
information from the time period of the event. They are useful because they provide evidence
left by eyewitnesses or people who lived at the time.

Secondary sources, like books and articles, are created using information from primary
sources. These sources are useful because they are easy to find.



Information or Event Primary Source

1
Primary sources are ONE
step away from the information
or event.



Secondary Source

2
Secondary sources are
TWO steps away from the
information or event.



**Practice**
Show whether a resource is primary or secondary by circling the correct term.

**Scoring a Sample Writing**


**Directions:** Read the response to the prompt. Based on the rubric, determine an overall
score for the short writing sample.


Prompt: “How are innovations in nuclear energy making it more affordable for
Americans?”


**Overall Score:**


Nuclear energy is becoming more affordable. Since its discovery, researchers and
scientists have utilized nuclear energy in new innovations. These innovations have
impacted people in their daily lives. For example, potential nuclear power plants that
are built smaller will reduce the cost and waste of traditional nuclear power plants. This
is important since the demand for electricity is particularly high, especially in Texas.
Admiral Hyman G. Rickover created ships and submarines for the American navy that
ran with nuclear energy. This saved fuel costs for the American government. Overall,
innovations in nuclear energy have had and continue to have a positive economic impact
on Americans.
