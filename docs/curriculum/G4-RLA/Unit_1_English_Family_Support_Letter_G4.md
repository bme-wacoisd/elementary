# **Welcome!**
#### **Grade 4, Unit 1**
## **Personal Narratives**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will spend some time examining the genre of personal narratives.
### **What’s the story?**

Students will read different **personal narratives** and will work to **identify the elements** of this
particular genre. The personal narratives studied in this unit are based on the lives of Tomas Rivera, Clara
Driscoll (both Texans), and Peg Kehret.


Lessons 7–13 focus on excerpts from a longer work titled _**Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio**_ . You may
wish to have a discussion with students before Lesson 7 that provides basic information about infectious
diseases like measles and polio. The discussion would provide support for students who may be anxious
or fearful of such diseases and a setting for them to express and communicate their feelings.

### **What will my student learn?**

Students will learn elements like vivid **descriptive language**, **dialogue** that shows character, **defining**
**traits**, and **figurative language** . They will learn to make meaning from these texts to improve their
**comprehension skills** .

Students will **write every day** in this unit. In examining the different elements found in personal
narratives, they will build their knowledge of **descriptive writing** . They will also have opportunities to
use these elements in their writing by **creating** their **own personal** **narratives** .
### **Conversation starters**

Ask your student questions about the unit to promote discussion and continued learning:


1. What is a personal narrative?
**Follow up:** What are three things that make an essay a personal narrative?

2. How would you define character traits?
**Follow up:** What is your favorite book or movie? Who is your favorite character in it? Describe the
traits of that character. What evidence from the book or story supports your thinking? What do
you think people would say are your character traits? What evidence would they have to support
their thinking?

3. In this unit, you have been talking about sensory details. Look around us right now. Describe
sensory details you are noticing in our home.
**Follow up:** What do you see around you? What do you hear? Smell? Taste? Feel?

4. What is dialogue?
**Follow up:** What are some of the rules for punctuating dialogue?

5. What is one of the memories you chose to write about in this unit?
**Follow up:** Why did you choose this memory? Share with me what you wrote about and how you
incorporated some of the elements of personal narratives into your writing.
