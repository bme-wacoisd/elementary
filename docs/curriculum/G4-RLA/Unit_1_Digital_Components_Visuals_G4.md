### **Tomás Rivera**

Tomás Rivera was a famous author, poet, and educator. He was born and


raised in Texas in a family of migrant workers who traveled often to work on


farms. He grew up to be a teacher, a college professor, and the author of many


books that showed what life was like in the Hispanic community in the 1940s


and 1950s. While not written by him, these tales imagine what life may have


been like for Tomás over the years


Words can be powerful. I have learned throughout my life that words can be


life-changing. As a child, I heard words, I spoke words, and I read words. As I


grew older, I put the words in my head onto paper. My words became books.


When I was a teacher and professor, my words became teachings to others.


When I think back to when I first discovered the power of words, one memory


always comes to mind.


Unit 1 Lesson 2 Digital Component 2.1 **1**


###### **Can you identify where** **your school is located on** **the map?**

Unit 1 Lesson 3 Digital Component 3.1 **3**


### **Multipart Question - Part A**

_This question has two parts. First, answer Part A. Then answer Part B._

Maggie wants to include imagery in her personal narrative about her trip to Lost Maples State Natural
Area. Which choice would be best for the first event in her story?


A. Have you ever been to a state park? When my parents told me that we were going to go to Lost
Maples State Natural Area over fall break, I wasn’t exactly excited. My mom told me I was in for a
surprise. I wasn’t so sure.


B. After our long invigorating hike through the woods, we rested at a worn wooden picnic table and
gulped cool refreshing water from our water bottles. We were too winded to speak, but the smiles
on our faces said enough.


C. When we drove into the parking lot, I could already tell that this was not the usual landscape of
stores and roads in my part of Texas. The trees slowly danced in the wind, displaying the beautiful
bright colors I’d seen in pictures of fall in other places.


D. We stopped along the way to admire the beautiful red, orange, yellow, and fading green leaves that
surrounded us and littered the sun-speckled path, crunching beneath our steps. Nearby, a brook
softly babbled to the rocks around it.


Unit 1 Lesson 4 Digital Component 4.1 **4**


### **Multipart Question - Part B**

Which reason explains why your answer from Part A is the best choice?


A. It has the most imagery of all the choices.


B. It introduces the story in an engaging way.


C. It is the first thing Maggie should have her audience read.


D. It describes the first event of her trip and uses imagery.


Unit 1 Lesson 4 Digital Component 4.2 **5**


### **A Cowboy Tends to a Herd of Cattle**

This shows a cattleman herding
a herd of cows on a cattle drive.
Clara Driscoll’s father and his
cattlemen would have looked
similar to this picture.


Unit 1 Lesson 5 Digital Component 5.1 **6**


### **Cattle Drive Kitchen**

This is a picture of a wagon
known as a “chuck wagon.” This
was a wagon that held supplies
for cooking and was like a little
kitchen on wheels. On a cattle
drive they would use this wagon
to store their food. They just had
to add a fire. This would be very
similar to where Clara Driscoll
ate her meals.


Unit 1 Lesson 5 Digital Component 5.2 **7**


### **Short Constructed Response Reading Question**

###### What does paragraph 11 reveal about Mr. Driscoll’s character? Support your answer with evidence from the story. **To meet expectations, the student will write a complete response** **that:**


**•** Explains what paragraph 11 reveals about Mr. Driscoll’s character.


**•** Includes at least one piece of supporting evidence from the text.


**•** Cites the text evidence with a paragraph number.


**•** Uses evidence accurately to support the response.


Unit 1 Lesson 6 Digital Component 6.1 **8**


### **Examples of Dialogue in “Clara Driscoll: Lessons I Learned on a Cattle Drive”**


**•** I asked, “Daddy, will you tell me more about my grandfather and the memories you
have of him?”


**•** “I would love nothing more,” Daddy replied.


**•** “He sounds like an exceptional man. I am so glad you have those memories,” I said
softly.


**•** “Do I have memories living inside of me?” I questioned.
