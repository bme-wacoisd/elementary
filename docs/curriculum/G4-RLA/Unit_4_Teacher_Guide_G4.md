##### Introduction


~~**THE MIDDLE AGES**~~


This introduction includes the necessary background information to teach _The Middle Ages_ . The unit

contains 14 daily lessons, plus one Pausing Point day that may be used for differentiated instruction.

Each entire lesson will require a total of 90 minutes. The final lesson is devoted to a unit assessment.


The sequence is designed to build background knowledge coherently and cumulatively so that

students can understand a full range of complex texts and engage in deep conversations about the

world around them. This program is built upon the sequence and uses it to create a comprehensive

reading/language arts curriculum.


~~**WHY THIS UNIT IS IMPORTANT**~~


_The Middle Ages_ covers the history of the Middle Ages in Europe. The unit deals primarily with the

events of western Europe and the relationship between the Christian Church and the rulers of the

region. The unit also ties to topics discussed in grade 3, as many aspects of government and culture

of the Middle Ages is tied to the decline of the Roman Empire. The unit also introduces students to the

Crusades and the clash of civilizations between the Christian and Muslim worlds.


**Prior Knowledge**

Students who have received instruction in the program in Grades K–3 will already have pertinent

background knowledge for this unit. For students who have not received prior instruction in the

program, introductory knowledge will be presented in the Core Connections lesson in Lesson 1. Prior

units of particular interest are as follows:


Kings and Queens (Kindergarten)


Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government (Grade 2)


Ancient Rome (Grade 3)


~~**READER FOR THIS UNIT**~~


The Reader for this unit includes complex text and prepares students in Grade 4 for the increased

vocabulary and syntax demands aligned texts will present in later grades. For more information about

the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the

Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


Introduction _The Middle Ages_

~~**WRITING**~~


In the writing lessons, students will review the stages of the writing process and engage in an extended

writing project. In this unit, students will use a graphic organizer to take notes on information

presented in the Reader; paraphrase information from a text; assess information to form an opinion;

and draft an opinion paragraph.


During all classroom writing tasks, please encourage students to generate logical, defensible spellings

based on code knowledge, rather than guessing. Students should refer to the Individual Code Chart

(located in Student Resources in the Activity Book), which lists spellings for each sound in the English

language in order from most frequently used spelling to least frequently used spelling.


Earlier grades in the program include five steps in the writing process: planning, drafting, revising,

editing, and publishing. Beginning in Grade 4, the writing process expands to include the following

components: planning, drafting, sharing, evaluating, revising, and editing (and the optional component

of publishing).


In Grades 4 and 5, the writing process is no longer conceptualized as a series of linear steps (an

important change from the Grade 3 writing process). Rather, students move between components of

the writing process in a flexible manner similar to the process mature and experienced writers follow

naturally.


Writing lessons include multiple opportunities for peer collaboration and teacher scaffolding.

Additionally, when students write, you should circulate around the room and check in with students to

provide brief, targeted feedback.


In addition to specific writing lessons, there are numerous writing opportunities throughout the

program. For example, students regularly engage in writing short answers in response to text-based

questions. In these writing opportunities, students will focus on the use of evidence from the text and

individual sentence construction. Please encourage students to use the Individual Code Chart to spell

challenging words while they engage in these writing activities.


In this unit, students will practice taking notes from the informational text of the Reader, as well as

practice writing an informative paragraph and an opinion essay.


In Grade 4, students will write legibly in cursive to complete assignments. Students should be able to

use their knowledge of letter connections, appropriate spacing, and letter height to ensure legibility

for the reader. In order to master these skills, encourage students to complete activities in cursive

throughout the unit.


Unit 4


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available in the digital version provided with the

online materials. This component was created to accompany the program materials for Grades 4

and 5. It consists of selections from a variety of genres, including poetry, folklore, fables, and other

selections. These selections provide additional opportunities for students to practice reading with

fluency and expression (prosody). There are sufficient selections so you may, if desired, use one

selection per week. For more information on implementation, please consult the supplement.

**Primary Focus:** Students will sequence five events on a timeline spanning BC and

AD to accurately place their discussion of the Middle Ages in the context of time

and their background knowledge. ~~**TEKS 4.6.E; TEKS 4.6.H**~~


Students will follow, restate, and give oral instructions that involve a series

of steps. ~~**TEKS 4.1.B**~~


~~**REVIEW PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students they will begin a unit called _The Middle Ages._ Explain that before
reading the first chapter of the Reader, you are going to talk about some
things they may have learned before that will help them understand what
they will learn in this unit.


  - Ask students what the term _ancient_ means.

    - “existing a very long time ago”

  - Remind students who participated in the program in previous grades that
they have learned about several civilizations from ancient times. They
learned about ancient Greece and ancient Rome, among others.


  - Explain that the events leading to the Middle Ages began with the Roman
Empire. Remind students who participated in the program in Grade 3 that
they learned about the Roman Empire in the _Ancient Rome_ unit. Instruct
students who did not receive Grade 3 instruction in the program to pay
particular attention to this preview so they will have the background
knowledge they need to understand the first chapter.


  - Ask students if they know or remember what an empire is.


    - A group of nations or territories controlled by the same leader. The leader
is usually called an emperor (if the leader is a man) or an empress (if the
leader is a woman).


  - Explain that an emperor is somewhat like a king, but he may be even more
powerful than a king. Explain that a king rules a kingdom, but an empire may
contain many different kingdoms, each with its own king. All the kings must
obey the emperor, who rules over the entire empire.


**TEKS 4.6.E** Make connections to personal experiences, ideas in other texts, and society; **TEKS 4.6.H** Synthesize information
to create new understanding; **TEKS 4.1.B** Follow, restate, and give oral instructions that involve a series of related sequences
of action.

Support


For students who do not
recall where these countries
are located on a map,
provide a resource such as
a labeled map or a globe for
them to use as a reference.


Challenge


When students finish
labeling their map, ask
them to prepare for the
upcoming discussion
by thinking about some
challenges an emperor or
empress might have ruling
over such a large area.




 - Tell students that the Roman Empire was a great empire that began over
2,000 years ago. It lasted a very long time and spread over a very large area
of land.


~~**LABEL A MAP (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 1.1 and explain that this is a map of
Europe and the northern part of Africa. The shaded areas were part of the
ancient Roman Empire. Have students identify the two continents on the
map (Europe in the north and Africa in the south).


 - Have students locate the modern-day countries of Spain, France, England,
Germany, and Italy, and label them on the map of Europe. Explain that
the Roman Empire included at least parts of each of these modern-day
countries.


 - Tell students that many important developments occurred during the Roman
Empire. Discuss the following developments:


   - The empire grew very large until it became difficult for one emperor to rule
over the entire empire.


   - During the time of the Roman Empire, a new religion, known as
Christianity, began. Jesus of Nazareth was a religious teacher who lived in
the time of Ancient Rome. He is revered by Christians as Jesus Christ, the
Son of God. Over time, Christianity grew, and the Christian church became
a very important part of the lives of many people in Europe.


   - A language known as Latin was the official language of both the government
and the church during and after the time of the Roman Empire.


 - Explain that during this unit on the Middle Ages, students will focus on the
part of the world where the Roman Empire once existed. They will also hear
about the end of the Roman Empire, and the importance of Latin and the
church in Europe in the years after the end of the Roman Empire.



Unit 4
**10**


~~**CREATE A TIMELINE (25 MIN.)**~~


  - Direct students to the timeline on the board/chart paper. Ask them to
describe what they see. (Students should note the labels “Ancient Times”
and “Modern Times,” and the notations “BC” and “AD.”) Explain that we
capitalize historical periods because they are considered proper nouns.


  - Tell students that _BC_ and _AD_ are terms applied to years. BC stands for before
Christ, and BCE stands for before the Common Era or before the Christian
Era. Explain that BC and BCE are two terms used to reference events that
came before the birth of Jesus of Nazareth, also referred to as Jesus Christ.
Explain that today we live in the period known as AD or CE. AD stands for
Anno Domini and, in English, it means “in the Year of the Lord.” Tell students
this describes the time after Jesus was born. CE stands for Common Era
or Christian Era. Tell students that some people today use the terms BCE
(before the Common Era) and CE (of the Common Era). But, BC and AD are
also still widely used. They will hear both sets of terms.


  - The current period Anno Domini (often called After Christ) begins with 1 AD;
years prior to that are referred to as BC. Explain that the years in the Anno
Domini are counted in the usual way: 1, 2, 3, and so on. Years in BC, however,
are counted backward from 1. Explain that, because of this backward
counting, something that happened in 1000 BC occurred before something
that took place in 500 BC. Ask them to think of this timeline like a number
line that they use in math.


  - State that, as a group, you are going to place several events on the timeline in
the proper order, using the Image Cards provided in the Teacher Resources
section and the card you created. Each card contains the name of a
civilization or event, an image representing that civilization or event, and
a year. For the three civilization cards, the year listed is one of the years in
which the civilization existed. For the event cards, the year is the specific year
in which the event took place.


  - Put students in groups of five and give each group a set of the five event
cards.


  - Ask students to restate the instructions in their own words to one or more
students in their group. Have them explain their understanding of AD and BC.


  - Have each group discuss the images and dates on the cards. Remind
students that the years that occurred “before Christ” (or labeled “BC”) are
counted backward. As a result, the events with the highest numbers BC
occurred earlier and will be placed farther on the left side of the timeline.
Have students in the audience direct the card-holding students to arrange
themselves so the cards are in the proper order using the dates. This will help
students understand the chronology of the civilizations and events. Once
students have the cards in the proper sequence, have the rest of the class
read aloud the civilization or event and the date on which it occurred. Then
have students attach the cards to the timeline. ~~**[ TEKS 4.1.B ]**~~


**TEKS 4.1.B** Follow, restate, and give oral instructions that involve a series of related sequences of action.

Check for Understanding


Check that each group has placed the cards in the correct spot on the
timeline. Follow up by asking the groups why they think we call this time
period the Middle Ages. If students do not respond correctly, prompt
them to refer back to the location of this time period on the timeline.


                 - Next, have students note the labels “Ancient Times” and “Modern Times” above
the timeline. Explain that some historians use those labels to divide history into
general time periods so it is easier to study and talk about. Explain that not all
historians agree on the specific end date of ancient times and beginning date of
modern times, but they generally agree that the Middle Ages occurred between
the two. To reflect this, write the words _The Middle Ages_ above the timeline
between _Ancient Times_ and _Modern Times_ . Explain that many historians use
the term _Middle Ages_ to refer to the time between the years 450 and the late
1400s AD. Write these years on the timeline beneath the label _The Middle Ages_ .


~~**LESSON WRAP-UP (5 MIN.)**~~


                  - Have students explain what continent or region of the world they will be
studying in the Middle Ages unit.

                        - Europe; specifically the western part of Europe.


                        - What ancient empire covered much of this land?


                        - The Roman Empire.

**25**


~~**DISCUSS THE CHAPTER AND LESSON WRAP-UP (10 MIN.)**~~


                 - Use the following questions to discuss the chapter.


1. **Literal.** The name of this unit is _The Middle Ages_ . What is the Middle Ages

and why is it called that?


» The Middle Ages is the approximately thousand-year time period between ancient

and modern times. Modern historians gave it that name because it falls between

those two periods in history.


Did the people who lived during that time use the name _Middle Ages_ to talk

about the time period in which they were living?


» The people who lived during that time did not use the name _Middle Ages_ because

they did not consider themselves to be in the middle of anything.


**Note:** Question 2 relates to The Big Question of this chapter.


2. **Literal.** What were some of the important events or developments that took

place in Europe and led to the Middle Ages?


» The Roman Empire grew too large to be ruled by one emperor, so it broke into two

parts; several Germanic tribes, such as the Franks, Vandals, and Visigoths, invaded

parts of the Roman Empire; the power of the church increased; the Black Death

killed one-third of Europe’s population; impressive and inspiring architecture

was created.


3. **Support.** What happened to the Roman Empire that had a major impact on

western Europe?


» The Roman Empire was divided into two empires—the Western Empire and

the Eastern Empire—and various tribes of barbarians then took over some of

these lands.


4. **Support.** What role did the Church play in the Middle Ages?


» The Church provided a sense of stability and hope in a time of great change. Over

time, it became even richer and more powerful than many kings and queens.


5. **Inferential.** Why might Charlemagne, as one of the early leaders during

the Middle Ages, have set up the feudal system, in which people such as

kings and lords offered protection to serfs and freemen in exchange for

their loyalty?


» Answers may vary, but may include that in the early years of the Middle Ages

there were many groups invading western Europe, so there was a need for

protection. In return for the protection the kings and lords offered, they would

want the serfs and freemen they protected to be loyal to them and not join with

other groups to fight against them.


Unit 4
**26**


6. **Evaluative.** How would you contrast life in the Middle Ages with life today?


» Answers may vary, but may include that people in the Middle Ages thought about

time differently, being more directly tied to the rising and the setting of the sun

rather than the hours and minutes of clocks; that people undertook long-term

projects, such as building great cathedrals; and that most people never traveled

far from their homes.


  - Call on several students to each describe one positive or one negative thing
that happened during the Middle Ages.


  - Have students take home Activity Page 1.4, an excerpt of the chapter,
“Welcome to the Middle Ages,” read this excerpt, and answer the questions
that follow. Also have students take home Activity Page 1.5, a copy of the
Reader glossary, to keep at home to help with their homework during this
unit.

5. What are some other examples of things that have been transformed, and
how were they transformed? Be sure to use the word _transform_ when you
talk about it.


  - Ask two or three students to use the target word in a sentence. If necessary,
guide students and/or rephrase their responses to make complete
sentences: “___ was transformed by ___. ”


6. What part of speech is the word _transform_ ?

prediction before reading. Model using a text feature to make a prediction
about what will be studied in this chapter.


   - Invite students to Turn and Talk with a partner to share a prediction about
what will be studied in Chapter 2.



Unit 4
**34**


**Read “To the Manor Born”**


 - Before reading this chapter, remind students there are many strategies they
can use to define unfamiliar words. Have students find the word _livestock_ on
page 9. Point out that this word is not bolded, so it does not appear in the
glossary. It is, however, defined within the text itself. Point out that the word
_livestock_ is followed by a comma and an explanation of what livestock is.


 - Have students read page 9 silently.



Support


Students may be
unfamiliar with the word
_embroider_ . If so, explain
that it means a way of
sewing, using pantomime
to demonstrate sewing
with cloth and a needle
and thread.



Lesson 2 Lords and Serfs
**35**


Support


Were most people born in a
manor or serfs?


» serfs



**Literal.** What were some of the things manor-born boys and girls learned to do?


» They learned to ride horses. Some boys and girls also learned to read and write.

Boys learned to become swordsmen, while girls learned to embroider, dance, and

play an instrument.


**Literal.** What does the author tell us were the primary responsibilities of serfs?


» growing the food and tending the animals



Unit 4
**36**


  - Have students read page 10 silently.


  - What irregular plural word did you read on page 10? (children) That is
correct. _Children_ is the plural form of the word, child. Can you think of other
words that follow this irregular pattern? (man/men, woman/women, person/
people, etc.) Keep an eye out for these words as you read the rest of the text.


**Inferential.** What is another name for a castle? How does this, along with the
information you read on page 9, help explain the meaning of the title of this chapter?


» manor house


» On page 9, the author said that people in the Middle Ages either were born

privileged and would live in a large manor house, or were not born privileged.

“To the manor born” refers to the fact that someone born in a manor house would

live a privileged life. In the Middle Ages, everyone’s way of life was set from birth.

If someone was “born to the manor,” he or she would have a privileged life.


Lesson 2 Lords and Serfs
**37**


**Inferential.** Based on what you just read, who do you think had more power and
freedom in the Middle Ages—serfs or lords? Why?


» Lords. Serfs had to get permission from lords to travel to a nearby town or get

married, but lords did not have to get permission from anyone. Lords also owned

and controlled the land, and often the nearby towns and villages, but serfs did not

own or control any of the land.


Unit 4
**38**


- Have students silently read page 11 to the end of the sentence on the top
of page 12.


How did a lord become even richer or wealthier through his serfs?


» Lords received taxes in the form of money, crops, and livestock, and charged fees

to grind flour.


**Inferential.** How does the author compare and contrast the lives of serfs and
landowners?


» The text structure. The author describes the daily lives of both groups and

explains how they were different or similar.



Support


Describe the houses in
which serfs lived.


» small and simple; in or
near a village; made of
wood and mud; thatched
roofs; one room; beds
made of straw; small
fireplace with a hole
in the roof to allow the
smoke to escape.


Support


Have students re-read the
first paragraph of page 10
and the second paragraph
of page 11. What is being
compared?


» the homes of serfs and
lords



Lesson 2 Lords and Serfs
**39**


Support


Did severe punishment
stop serfs from hunting in
the lord’s forests to avoid
starving? What was this
practice of illegally hunting
in the lord’s forests called?


» No. It was called
poaching.




- Have students read page 12 silently.


**Inferential.** Why was medieval society organized for war?


» It was a violent time compared to how we live today, and people needed

armed protection.



Unit 4
**40**


**Literal.** Refer to Activity Page 2.2, an enlarged version of which is displayed on the
wall. Reflect on, or think carefully about, the diagram on Activity Page 2.2, which you
saw in chapter 1. What did the lords offer serfs in exchange for their loyalty?


» protection


**Inferential.** If the lord needed to put together an army for the king, who was
required to fight? Why do you think the lord did not make serfs fight?


» freemen


» Answers may vary, but could include that the lord needed serfs to stay and

continue working for him.


**Inferential.** Have students reflect on the image on page 11. Based on what you read,
what do you think is shown in this image?


» a lord’s manor or estate


Describe some of the things you see.


» Answers may vary, but could include the large, well-protected manor house on the

left; the church; the serfs’ small houses.



Activity Page 2.2



Lesson 2 Lords and Serfs
**41**


                 - Have students read pages 13 and 14 silently.


Unit 4
**42**


**Literal.** How did the serfs’ jobs change during different seasons of the year?


» In the spring, fields were plowed and planted, and mother animals needed help

delivering their young. In the summer, crops were protected and tended. In the

fall, crops were harvested and grain was stored. In the winter, fences and barns

were repaired.


Lesson 2 Lords and Serfs
**43**


                 - Have students read the section titled “Medieval Musings.” Remind students
that to muse over something is to think about it. If time permits, have
students conduct research independently, in pairs, or in small groups, to
learn the answers to these questions. Otherwise, consider allowing students
to complete the activity at a different time during the day.


Unit 4
**44**


- Direct students to the “Letter Quest” section and explain that in this activity
they will search the image for a hidden letter. There is a Letter Quest at
the end of each chapter, starting with chapter 2. Later in the day, as time
permits, students may use Activity Page 2.3 to record the letter they find
in each chapter’s Letter Quest. At the end of part 1 of the unit, students will
arrange these letters to spell a word that relates to the Middle Ages.

~~**DISCUSS THE CHAPTER AND LESSON WRAP-UP (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Give students 1-2 minutes and a sticky note to jot down any questions they
thought of after reading the chapter.


 - Use the following questions to discuss the chapter:


1. **Literal.** Serfs and the lord each did something for the other. What did each

promise the other?


» Serfs spent part of their time working for the lord and promised their loyalty. The

lord provided land for serfs to grow their own food and promised them protection.


2. **Evaluative.** Imagine you are traveling through the medieval countryside,

and you see a boy about your age. Based on today’s reading, what evidence

would you use to decide whether the child is a serf or a noble?


» His clothes would provide one clue: a noble would be wearing nice clothing and a

serf would be wearing work clothes. What he is doing would be another important

clue. A noble boy might be riding a horse, learning how to use a sword, or reading

and writing. A serf boy might be working in the fields or the forest, taking care of

crops or animals, or walking to and from the fields.


3. **Inferential.** Describe what you would see on a lord’s estate during the

Middle Ages.


» a large, well-protected manor house; a small church; small serfs’ houses; fields,

which are divided into strips; serfs plowing the lord’s fields and tending to their

own, smaller gardens; serfs tending to livestock


4. **Literal.** After reading text, good readers confirm or correct the predictions

they made before reading. Was your prediction correct? What might you

change? ~~**[ TEKS 4.6.C ]**~~


5. **Evaluative.** Think-Pair-Share. Why do you think the feudal system, or the

arrangement between lords and serfs, existed?


» Answers may vary, but should include details from the text regarding the duties

and needs of each group, including the need for protection and a way to obtain

food and shelter.


 - Have students display the sticky notes on a chart that can be referred to at
the end of the lesson.


Check for Understanding


Point out signs for “Strongly Agree,” “Agree,” “Strongly Disagree,” and
“Disagree” in the four corners of your classroom. Have students move to
the corner that best matches their feeling about the statement, “A lord
and a serf have nothing in common.” Use their location as an indication of
what they understood from the text in relation to The Big Question.

Lesson 2 Lords and Serfs
**47**


**Lesson 2: Lords and Serfs**
##### Language


~~**GRAMMAR (15 MIN.)**~~



30 M



**Primary Focus:** Students will discover the function and relationships of nouns and

adjectives by identifying them in sentences. ~~**[TEKS 4.11.D.iii; TEKS 4.11.D.iv ]**~~


**Introduce Nouns and Adjectives**


                  - Tell students that they will focus on specific parts of speech called nouns and
adjectives. Parts of speech are categories of words grouped by how they are
used in a sentence.


Nouns


                 - Refer to the poster you displayed in advance and explain that nouns are
words that name people, places, or things. Ask students to help make a list
on the board/chart paper of nouns that name things they can see in the
room. For example, you might write, _desk, board, Sandra, paper, pencil, girl,_
_boy, door, window, floor,_ and _wall_ . Explain that these are singular nouns.
Model adding ‘s’ to one noun to make it plural.


**Note:** Proper nouns begin with capital letters, whereas common nouns

do not. Refer to the poster on the board and ask students if their list has

common and/or proper nouns. Be sure to include all categories of both

proper and common nouns.

                  - Tell students that nouns can be placed into two categories, or groups,
called common nouns and proper nouns. Explain the difference between
common and proper nouns. (Common nouns name people, places, or things
in general, whereas proper nouns name specific people, places, or things.
Proper nouns are capitalized and common nouns aren’t.) Ask students to
give examples of proper nouns to add to the list of nouns started above.


Adjectives


                 - Remind students that adjectives are words that describe nouns. Adjectives
provide details about nouns, such as their number, color, shape, or mood.

                 - Have students refer to the list of common nouns on the board and ask them
to add adjectives that describe the nouns. For example, you might write,
_wooden desk, white board, lined paper, sharp pencil, red book, tall boy, brown_
_door, clear window, clean floor,_ and _pink wall_ . Adjectives can come before or
after the noun, as in “The wall is pink” or “There is a pink wall.”


**TEKS 4.11.D** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including (iii) singular, plural, common, and proper nouns;
(iv) adjectives, including their comparative and superlative forms.


Unit 4
**48**


Tell students that adjectives help one to picture the noun in their mind.




  - Remind students that the words _a_, _an_, and _the_ are special kinds of adjectives
called _articles_ . Articles provide details about nouns. Articles tell us whether
someone is describing a specific noun (e.g., _the king_ or _the apple_ ) or a
general noun (e.g., _a king_ or _an apple_ ).


  - Write the following sentences on the board and work with students to
identify nouns and adjectives. Label nouns with _n._ Label adjectives with
_adj._ Remind students that these are the part-of-speech abbreviations
they see in the glossary. Draw an arrow from each adjective to the noun
it describes. The final sentence is a revising example.


    - Rich lords lived in large castles. (Nouns: _lords_, _castles_ ; adjectives: _rich_,
_large_ ; draw an arrow from _rich_ to _lords_ and from _large_ to _castles_ .)


    - The loyal serfs needed protection from a brave lord. (Nouns: _serfs_, _lord_ ;
adjectives: _loyal_, _brave_ ; draw an arrow from _loyal_ to _serfs_ and from _brave_ to
_lord_ .)


    - What change is needed in this sentence? Why? The lord told john to keep
the birds off the crops. (The name John needs to be capitalized; it is a
proper noun _._ )


  - Conclude by pointing out that good writers make frequent use of adjectives
to make their writing more interesting. Encourage students to take special
note of adjectives when they are reading the chapters in their Reader, as well
as to use adjectives when they are discussing or writing about the Middle
Ages.


  - To have students go more in depth with editing for adjectives, consult the
Editing Supplement which can be found in the Pausing Point.


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 2.4 and guide them through the first few
sentences. Have students complete the activity page independently, or, if
you determine they need more assistance, complete the activity page as a
teacher-guided activity. If more time is needed, students should complete
the activity page for homework.


~~**MORPHOLOGY (15 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students will use their knowledge of the prefixes _un_ - and _non_ - and

root words to read and determine the meaning of unfamiliar words.


~~**TEKS 4.2.A.iv; TEKS 4.3.C**~~


**TEKS 4.2.A.iv** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by: decoding words using knowledge of prefixes;
**TEKS 4.3.C** Determine the meaning of and use words with affixes such as mis-, sub-, -ment, and -ity/ty and roots such
as auto, graph, and meter.

Lesson 2 Lords and Serfs
**49**


**Introduce Prefixes un– and non–**


                  - Point to the Prefixes Poster and read it with the students.


                  - Tell students the two prefixes they will study are _un–_ and _non–._ Explain that
_un–_ and _non–_ both mean “not.”

                   - Write the prefix _un–_ on the poster and explain that it is pronounced /ən/.
Write the prefix _non–_ on the poster and explain that it is pronounced /non/.
Write the meaning of the prefixes on the poster.


                 - Remind students there are other prefixes that mean “not,” such as _dis–._


                  - Tell students that adding _un–_ or _non–_ does not change the part of speech of
the root word. Adding _un–_ or _non–_ changes the meaning of the root word.


                  - Write _familiar_ on the board/chart paper. Briefly discuss the meaning and
then use it in a sentence. ( _Familiar_ means “well known.” “The hallways of
your school will quickly become familiar because you walk through them
every day.”)


                - Add _un–_ to _familiar_ and have students read the new word. Discuss the
meaning of the new word. ( _Unfamiliar_ means “something that is not well
known.”) Also point out that the prefix _un–_ does not change the part of
speech of _familiar._ Both _familiar_ and _unfamiliar_ are adjectives. ~~**[ TEKS 4.3.C ]**~~


                 - Share the following example sentence you prepared in advance for the
word _unfamiliar:_


                        - The hard work of farm life was unfamiliar to members of the royal family;
they were used to having servants do things for them.


                 - Have students provide sentences using the word _unfamiliar_ . (Answers
may vary.)


                - Ask students for synonyms (words with almost the same meaning) of
_unfamiliar_ (e.g., _new,_ _different,_ _strange,_ and _novel)._


                  - Write _essential_ on the board. Briefly discuss the meaning of the word and
then use it in a sentence. ( _Essential_ means “extremely important and
necessary.” “Food, water, and air are essential to the survival of living things.”)


                - Add _non–_ to _essential_ and have students read the new word; discuss the
meaning of the new word. ( _Nonessential_ means “not extremely important or
necessary.”) Also point out that the prefix _non–_ does not change the part of
speech of _essential._ Both _essential_ and _nonessential_ are adjectives.


                 - Share the following example sentence from the board/chart paper for the
word _nonessential:_


                        - During a drought, my family and I don’t water our lawn or use water for
other nonessential things.


**TEKS 4.3.C** Determine the meaning of and use words with affixes such as mis-, sub-, -ment, and -ity/ty and roots such as

**50** auto, graph, and meter. Unit 4


 - Have students provide sentences using the word _nonessential_ . (Answers
may vary.)


 - Ask students for synonyms (words with almost the same meaning) of
_nonessential_ (e.g., _extra,_ _unimportant,_ and _insignificant_ ).


 - Continue in this manner for the remaining _un–_ and _non–_ words, using the
following chart as a guide.


**Note:** You will not write the information in the shaded columns on the board,

as that information is intended for use during oral instruction. You may not

complete all these examples, but complete as many as time permits.

- Have students turn to Activity Page 2.5. Briefly review the directions. Note
that for some sentences, the word _a(n)_ appears just before the blank. If
the word that fits correctly in the blank starts with a consonant, students
should read the sentence with the word _a._ If the word that fits correctly in the
blank starts with a vowel, they should read the sentence with the word _an._
For example, if the word _unbalanced_ is used to fill in the blank, the sentence
should start with the word _an._ If the word you would use to fill in the blank is
_balanced,_ the sentence should start with the word _a._ Have students complete
the activity page independently. If more time is needed, students should
complete the page for homework.

Beginning
Have students pull out only
key words (e.g., writing or
taxes) from text to include
in their graphic organizer.


Intermediate
Provide students with
teacher support for
paraphrasing after they
find the information in
the text that they want to
include in their graphic
organizer.


Advanced/Advanced High

Have students work in
heterogeneous small
groups to complete
the rest of the graphic
organizer.


~~**ELPS 1.C; ELPS 5.B**~~



**Primary Focus:** Students will use a graphic organizer to produce clear and coherent

writing that contrasts the life of a serf and that of a lord. ~~**[ TEKS 4.7.B; TEKS 4.9.D.ii ]**~~


Students will retell, paraphrase, or summarize texts in ways that maintain meaning and

logical order. ~~**TEKS 4.7.D**~~


~~**TAKING NOTES WITH GRAPHIC ORGANIZER (15 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 4.9.D.ii**~~


  - Students have just read Chapter 2, “To the Manor Born.” In this chapter they
learned about the lives of serfs and lords in the feudal system during the
Middle Ages. In this short writing lesson, you will model how to take notes on
a text using a graphic organizer. The goal of this lesson is to complete most of
the “Lords” column of the graphic organizer. If necessary, you may take time
at the beginning of the next writing lesson to finish completing this column.


**Model Taking Notes Using a Graphic Organizer**


  - Remind students that the Middle Ages text they have been reading is an
informational text and that there are many text features (e.g., headings,
captions, etc.) that are helpful in navigating the text. Explain that the images
in a chapter can also be useful in locating information, as the images usually
relate to the text around them.

  - Have students turn to Activity Page 2.6 as you display the Lords and Serfs
Graphic Organizer. Discuss the parts of the graphic organizer and the kinds of
information that should go into each box.

  - Explain that the graphic organizer is a useful tool that will highlight how
different the lives of lords and serfs were during the Middle Ages. Explain
that you will model how to scan text to locate information to complete a
graphic organizer.

  - Model the process of scanning the text, having students follow along in their
Readers while you think aloud. As you model, periodically call attention to the
use of nouns and adjectives in the notes you are creating.

  - Point out that the first category on the graphic organizer is “Homes.” Explain
that in order to take notes about the types of homes lords generally lived in
during the Middle Ages, students must scan the text and images for key words
and specific information. For example, you might say, “First, I am going to
look for information about how lords lived during the Middle Ages, about their
homes, work, clothing, food, and amount of power. Some of this information will
come from the text or text features, and other information might come from the
images. Scanning the text, I see the word _lord_ in bold in the first paragraph, so I
will start there.”



**TEKS 4.7.B** Write responses that demonstrate understanding of texts, including comparing and contrasting ideas across a
variety of sources; **TEKS 4.7.D** Retell, paraphrase, or summarize texts in ways that maintain meaning and logical order; **TEKS**
**4.9.D.ii** Recognize characteristics and structures of informational text, including features such as pronunciation guides and
diagrams to support understanding.

Unit 4
**52**


- As you are modeling with the “Homes” category, emphasize the importance
of writing key information in the shortest form possible, and of paraphrasing,
or writing the information in one’s own words.


- As you prompt students to begin working to complete the rest of the “Lords”
column in this graphic organizer, remind them that text features, such as
images and captions can provide details as well. Students should write the
number of the page where they found each piece of evidence next to their
paraphrased notes.


**Note:** This chart, with the inclusion of direct quotations from the text and

suggested paraphrasing, is provided for teacher reference. As you model,

you should read the direct quotation from the text and describe how to

transform that quotation into a written paraphrase. Students should

complete their graphic organizers with paraphrased notes from the text and

page numbers indicating where the information came from.

**Lesson Wrap-Up**


                 - Ask students to summarize one piece of evidence obtained from the text and
the way in which it was paraphrased. Ask students to explain how they used
text features to identify important information.


                 - If necessary, you may allow students to complete the “Lords” column of
the graphic organizer at the beginning of the next writing lesson. Or you
may choose to assign the completion of the “Lords” column of the graphic
organizer for homework.


                 - Students should keep this graphic organizer in a safe place to complete for
homework and/or use in future lessons, or you may wish to collect these to
store for use in future lessons.


                 - Revisit the questions students posted on the sticky note chart and have a
class discussion to answer these either in small groups or in the whole group
setting.

                 - Ask students if they have any questions about the excerpt “If You Were a
Boy Serf.”


                  - Tell students they will reread chapter 2, “To the Manor Born.”


                  - Have students turn to the table of contents, locate the chapter, and then turn
to the first page of the chapter.


                 - Have one student read The Big Question at the beginning of the chapter.
Ensure students understand the meaning of The Big Question before reading
the chapter.

**Re-Reading: “To the Manor Born”**


 - Read the title of the chapter together as a class: “To the Manor Born.” As
you read portions of the chapter, pause to explain or clarify the text at each
point indicated.


 - Have students silently read the first paragraph on page 9.


Look at the sentence “If you lived during the Middle Ages, your life followed one of
a few set paths.” The word _path_ has a few different meanings. A path is an actual
track on the ground on which people and animals can walk. Path can also mean the
direction a person’s life takes.

Lesson 3 Writing an Informative Paragraph about Lords
**59**


**Inferential.** How is the word _path_ used in this sentence? What words provided clues
to help determine which meaning applies to the text?


» In this sentence the author is using the meaning “the direction a person’s life

takes” The words that provide clues are “your life followed”.


**Inferential.** What words or phrases provide clues to the meaning of _privileged_ ?


» Possible clues in the text include: “enough food to eat and clothes to wear”;

“relatively nice house”; “servants”; “one of the few who learned to read and write”;

“learned to ride a horse”; “become a skilled swordsman”; “learned to embroider,

to dance, and to play a musical instrument,” etc.


What clues do you get from the images on pages 9 and 10?


» The people in the image on page 9 are dressed in nice clothes and are not working

in the fields as are the serfs in the images on page 10.


                - Have students read the second paragraph on page 9.


**Inferential.** The text says, “In the early Middle Ages, nearly everyone in Europe
worked on the land.” The author uses the phrase _nearly everyone_ to mean almost
every person. “Worked on the land” means that they performed work outside,
such as farming, tending to the animals, etc.; they did not work in a shop or
a factory. What do you think the author means by “nearly everyone in Europe
worked on the land”?


» The author means almost everyone did some type of work that involved the land,

such as farming or tending to the animals that were raised for food.


Unit 4
**60**


 - Have students turn to page 10 and locate the final sentence of the first
paragraph. Read that sentence aloud and then have students reread the
sentence silently.


**Literal.** What does the word _controlled_ mean in this sentence?


» It means the lord had the power to tell the serfs what to do.


**Evaluative.** How were the lives of lords and serfs different from one another in the
Middle Ages?


» The lord was privileged and had power over his manor, the surrounding land,

nearby villages, and all the people on his land and in the nearby villages. In

contrast, there were many serfs, and they had low status and no power. They did

as the lord told them.


Lesson 3 Writing an Informative Paragraph about Lords
**61**


                 - Have students silently read the third paragraph on page 11.


When the text says, “serfs paid taxes to the lord,” it means they gave him money,
crops, and livestock as payment for living on his land.


                 - Have students silently read the first sentence in the last paragraph on page 11.


**Inferential.** Based on the entire sentence, what do you think it means when the text
says, “If crops failed”?


» It means if crops did not grow and there was no food.


Which part of the sentence gives you a clue about the meaning of the phrase
_crops failed_ ?


» The phrase _people struggled to survive_ gives a clue as to the meaning of the

phrase _crops failed_ .


Unit 4
**62**


**Inferential.** The author says, “Even when food supplies were low, serfs were not
allowed to hunt in the lord’s forests. However, to avoid starving, people sometimes
hunted illegally.” The author uses the word _however_ in the second sentence to
signal a contrast or difference taking place. Taken together, what do these two
sentences mean?


» Although hunting in the lord’s forests was not allowed, serfs did hunt there some

of the time so they wouldn’t starve.


- Have students read the last paragraph on page 12 silently.



Challenge


Ask students to name
other words or phrases
that show contrast.



Lesson 3 Writing an Informative Paragraph about Lords
**63**


**Inferential.** In this paragraph, the author describes the structure of society in the
Middle Ages. How was medieval society structured?


» It was structured so people at higher levels of the social structure (such as kings

and nobles) provided protection to groups at a lower social level, and those at

lower levels of the structure swore their loyalty to people at the higher levels of

the structure.


Why was it structured in this way?


» Medieval society was structured this way to address the need for armed

protection because it was a violent time compared to how we live today.


Unit 4
**64**


 - Read the first two sentences on page 13 aloud.


**Literal.** What did working a full day mean for a boy serf?


» working from before the sun was fully risen until the sun was setting


 - Direct students to the image at the bottom of page 13 and its caption.


**Inferential.** Based on what you read in the text, what season is shown in this
image? How do you know?


» Early summer; the caption says the boy is chasing the birds away from the crops,

and the text says serfs kept hungry birds and insects away from crops in the

summer. Because the crops are very small in the picture, it must be the early part

of summer.


Lesson 3 Writing an Informative Paragraph about Lords
**65**


Support


Point out that _nevertheless_
is a word that shows
contrast.




- Read aloud the first two sentences of the first full paragraph on page 14.


**Inferential.** The author says, “Nevertheless, you have to get used to having less
food to eat in the wintertime, and to feeling hungry and cold more often than not.”
The word _nevertheless_ is used as a signal that, despite what was just described,
something will happen. In this text, the two sentences say, “A good harvest is a time
of celebration for all. Nevertheless, you have to get used to having less food to eat in
the wintertime, and to feeling hungry and cold more often than not.” Taken together,
what do these two sentences mean?


» Although a good harvest is a positive thing and a cause for celebrating, serfs

would still have many times in the winter when they were cold and hungry.



Unit 4
**66**


When the author says, “Your parents find it difficult to make ends meet,” he
or she is using an idiom. In the Personal Narratives unit, we learned that an
idiom is a phrase whose meaning is different from the literal meaning of the
words used in the phrase. This phrase means they don’t always have enough
money or food on which to live.


  - Tell students that an idiom is a literary device. Remind students that they
learned about literary devices in the Personal Narratives unit. Review that
literary devices are types of figurative language to better explain an idea,
bring more attention to a particular event, encourage the reader to feel
a certain way, clarify a point, illustrate a scene, or add to a description.
Authors also use literary devices simply to make the text more interesting or
engaging.

Lesson 3 Writing an Informative Paragraph about Lords
**69**


**Discuss the Chapter and Wrap Up the Lesson**


Ask students to list details from the chapter that show the differences between the
lives of serfs and lords.


» Answers may vary, but should include the following information:


                       - Lords were privileged and had more power than serfs.


                         - Lords controlled their land, or manor, and those who lived on it, as well as
surrounding villages and those who lived in them.


                        - Lords allowed serfs to grow their own crops in return for growing crops for the
lord and his family.


                       - Lords received taxes from serfs and offered them protection.


                       - Most people in the Middle Ages were serfs.


                        - Serfs worked and lived on land owned by the lord and had little power.


                        - Serfs lived difficult lives and endured hard daily work growing crops and tending
to livestock.


~~**WORD WORK: LOYAL (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the chapter, you read, “Freemen and serfs had to be loyal to their lord.”


2. Say the word _loyal_ with me.


3. _Loyal_ means “showing complete faithfulness and support.”


4. Even when Charlotte made new friends at school, she remained loyal to her
best friend, Olivia.


5. What are some examples of people or things that are loyal? Be sure to use
the word _loyal_ in your response.


                  - Ask two or three students to use the target word in a sentence. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to make complete sentences:
“I would describe ___ as being loyal“ or “I think ___ is loyal because ___.”


6. What part of speech is the word _loyal_ ?


» adjective


Unit 4
**70**


Check for Understanding


Ask students to discuss with a partner a time when they were
loyal to someone or when someone was loyal to them. The teacher
should circulate and listen to student anecdotes. If a student has a
misconception about the word, ask them to listen to another student who
has already demonstrated understanding of the word.



**Lesson 3: Writing an Informative Paragraph about Lords**
##### Writing



45 M



**Primary Focus:** Students will draft an informative paragraph about the life of a lord

during the Middle Ages that includes a topic sentence, detail sentences, transition

words, and a concluding sentence. ~~**[ TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.11.B.i ]**~~


~~**TOPIC SENTENCE (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students you will show them how to use their notes from the Lords and
Serfs Graphic Organizer on Activity Page 2.6 to compose an informative
paragraph describing the life of a lord during the Middle Ages.

  - Note that students practiced writing descriptive personal narrative
paragraphs as part of the Personal Narratives lessons. The basic elements
of an informative paragraph are identical to those students practiced in
the Personal Narratives lessons. The difference is that the informative
paragraphs will be written using notes taken from the informational chapters
in _Knights_, _Castles_, and _Chivalry_ .

  - Review the structure of an informative paragraph, using the Elements of an
Informative Paragraph Poster.

  - Model how to create a topic sentence using the information in the graphic
organizer. Reference the charts and remind students that a topic sentence
should include a specific subject important enough to write about. After
students complete the “Lords” column of the graphic organizer, guide
them to conclude that lords had power over serfs. This general summary
statement about lords is an effective topic sentence because it helps the
writer stay focused and write about one consistent topic in the paragraph.

  - Remind students they can revise the topic sentence after the paragraph has
been drafted, if needed.


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.11.B.i** Develop drafts into a focused, structured, and
coherent piece of writing by organizing with purposeful structure, including an introduction, transitions, and a conclusion.



Activity Page 2.6



Lesson 3 Writing an Informative Paragraph about Lords
**71**


                  - A great sentence starter begins with the topic of this unit. Here are a few
possibilities you could model by writing on the board/chart paper:


                        - In Europe in the Middle Ages, lords were powerful members of society.


                        - During the Middle Ages, lords had most of the money and power.


                        - During the Middle Ages, lords controlled the land and the people who
worked on it.


                 - Explain that a good topic sentence states the main idea of the paragraph.


                 - Prompt students to copy down their topic sentence on their paper before we
move on.


~~**DETAIL SENTENCES AND TRANSITION WORDS (15 MIN.)**~~


**Model Drafting Detail Sentences**


                 - Next, model how to create detail sentences using notes from the Lords and
Serfs Graphic Organizer. There are five categories on the graphic organizer
(“Homes,” “Work,” “Clothing,” “Food,” and “Amount of Power”), but students
should choose the three most interesting categories (those that have the
most information next to them in the graphic organizer) to transform into
detail sentences. For example, “Clothing” and “Food” have very few notes,
so we would not choose those categories for our detail sentences. Circle the
category labels “Homes,” “Work,” and “Amount of Power” on the displayed
graphic organizer and tell students you will use these categories to inspire your
detail sentences.


                  - Explain that because the notes in the graphic organizer are paraphrased
fragments (in our own words), they must be transformed into sentences to
become the three detail sentences: one about homes, one about work, and one
about power.


                - Remind students that complete sentences have subjects (who or what the
sentence is about) and predicates (what the subject is doing). Sentence
fragments can be transformed into sentences by the addition of the part of
the sentence that is missing, either a subject or a predicate.


                 - Here are some example detail sentences you could model by writing on the
board/chart paper:


                        - In Europe in the Middle Ages, a lord was a powerful member of society.
Lords lived in castles or manor houses (“Homes”).


                        - They made money by collecting taxes from serfs and fighting other
lords (“Work”).


                        - They owned the land all around them and controlled the lives of the people
who worked on the land (“Amount of Power”).


Unit 4
**72**


 - Model only one detail sentence.


 - Prompt students to write two to three detail sentences following their topic
sentence on their paper.


 - Tell students that transition words and phrases are helpful for making
sentences sound good together in a paragraph.


 - Model adding the transition phrase _in addition_ to the beginning of the detail
sentence about work to emphasize how powerful lords were during the
Middle Ages—so powerful that in addition to owning the land and controlling
other people, they could make extra money by receiving taxes and fighting
other lords. This also helps to vary how each sentence starts.


   - In Europe in the Middle Ages, a lord was a powerful member of society.
Lords lived in castles or manor houses. They owned the land all around
them and controlled the lives of the people who worked on the land. In
addition, they made money by collecting taxes from serfs and fighting
other lords.


 - Provide time for students to add one to two transition words to their detail
sentences on their paper.


~~**CONCLUDING SENTENCE (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Reference the chart and remind students a concluding sentence retells
the topic sentence in a different way. The concluding sentence should be
something that makes the reader remember the topic of the paragraph
(what you are describing; in this case, lords in the Middle Ages). The following
are a few possibilities for a concluding sentence you could model by writing
on the board/chart paper:


   - Lords were high up in society.


   - Lords were powerful members of medieval society because they had most
of the land and money.


   - Lords were more powerful than serfs because they had the right to control
much of the serfs’ lives.


 - Prompt students to finish their paragraph off with a concluding sentence on
their paper.

~~**LESSON REVIEW AND WRAP-UP (10 MIN.)**~~


                 - Read the drafted paragraph aloud and ask students to describe the elements
of the informative paragraph you drafted, using the poster as a guide.


Check for Understanding


Have students trade their papers with a peer and check their peer’s
work against the Elements of an Informative Paragraph Poster. Ask
them to label the topic sentence, detail sentences, transition words, and
concluding sentence. Students will also edit to ensure there are complete
sentences and no fragments. The teacher will schedule a writer’s
conference with the students who did not (or did not accurately) include
all necessary elements in their paragraph.


                 - If time allows, you may choose to have students begin taking notes in the
“Serfs” column of their graphic organizers. Students will have time in the
next writing lesson to work on the “Serfs” column of the graphic organizers.

**Primary Focus:** Students will refer to details and examples in the text when explaining

why knights and castles were needed in the Middle Ages. ~~**TEKS 4.7.C; TEKS 4.6.G**~~


~~**INTRODUCE THE CHAPTER (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students they will read chapter 3, “Gloomy Castles and Jousting Knights.”

  - Have students turn to the table of contents, locate the chapter, and then turn
to the first page of the chapter.

  - In this chapter, students will learn about knights and castles and their roles in
the Middle Ages.

  - Preview the core vocabulary words before reading the chapter.

  - Begin by telling students that the first vocabulary word they will encounter in
this chapter is _armor_ .

  - Have them find the word on page 17 of the Reader. Explain that each word is
bolded the first time it appears in the chapter.

  - Have students refer to the glossary at the back of the Reader to locate _armor_,
and then have a student read the definition.

  - Explain the following:


    - the part of speech


    - alternate forms of the word

  - Have students reference Activity Page 4.1 while you read each word and
its meaning.


**armor, n.** a protective covering used to keep a person safe from injury during

battle (armored)


**esteemed, adj.** highly regarded; admired


**influential, adj.** having power to change or affect important things or people


**title, n.** a name that describes a person’s job or status


**aspiring, adj.** hoping to be or become something


**enclose, v.** to surround; close in (enclosed)


**TEKS 4.7.C** Use text evidence to support an appropriate response; **TEKS 4.6.G** Evaluate details read to determine key ideas.



Unit 4

**siege, n.** a situation in which soldiers or police officers surround a city or

building to try to take control of it


 - Have one student read The Big Question at the beginning of the chapter.
Ensure that students understand the meaning of The Big Question before
reading the chapter.


   - Why was there a need for knights and castles during the Middle Ages?


**Establish Small Groups**


 - Before reading the chapter, divide students into two groups using the
following guidelines:


   - Small Group 1: This group should include students who need extra
scaffolding and support to read and comprehend the text. Use the guided
reading supports to guide students through reading the text. This is an
excellent time to make notes in your anecdotal records. Students may
complete Activity Page 4.2 with your support during reading.


   - Small Group 2: This group should include students who are capable of
reading and comprehending text without guided support. These students
may work as a small group, as partners, or independently to read the
chapter, discuss it with others in Small Group 2, and then complete
Activity Page 4.2. Make arrangements to check that students in Small
Group 2 have answered the questions on Activity Page 4.2 correctly.


~~**SMALL-GROUP READING: CHAPTER 3 (20 MIN.)**~~


 - The following guided reading supports are intended for use with
Small Group 1.


 - Remind students, particularly those in Small Group 2, that if they complete
the reading and Activity Page 4.2 before you call the class back together, they
may research the answers to the Medieval Musings on page 26 of the Reader,
as well as any other Medieval Musings in previous chapters. They may also
do the Letter Quest activity on that page and record their answer on Activity
Page 2.3.

Lesson 4 Knights and Castles
**81**


                 - Read the first paragraph on page 17 aloud.


**Inferential.** What was happening in the Middle Ages that often required young men
to become fighters?


                 - Have students record the answers to question 1 on Activity Page 4.2.


» There were rivalries among nobles, wars with other nations, and violence

among neighbors.


                  - Point out that the root word for _rivalries_ is _rival_, which they learned in an
earlier lesson. Remind students that _rival_ is an adjective, as in _rival_ _nations_,
meaning “competing nations,” and explain that _rivalries_ is a noun, meaning
“competitions” or “conflicts.”


Unit 4
**82**


**Literal.** Read the second paragraph on page 17. Remind students to use headings,
subheadings, images, and captions to better understand the text. These features
help to organize and better explain the information in the chapter. Point to the
images on pages 17 and 18, and ask students to read the captions and, using
information provided in the text, identify items used for protection.


» pike, chainmail, crossbow, armor


**Inferential.** Reread the last sentence in the second paragraph on page 17. The use
of _however_ in this sentence tells the reader that the author is about to introduce
information that contrasts with the information in the paragraph about ordinary
soldiers. A knight who was esteemed would have been highly regarded or admired,
unlike most ordinary soldiers. Would that make him higher or lower than a serf in the
feudal system?


» higher


Lesson 4 Knights and Castles
**83**


                 - Read the first paragraph on page 18.


**Evaluative.** What are two differences between foot soldiers and knights?


                 - Have students record the answers to question 2 on Activity Page 4.2.


» Answers will vary but may include the following:


                        - Foot soldiers did not fight on horseback; knights did.


                       - Most foot soldiers had padded coats; knights wore metal armor.


                        - Foot soldiers did not receive much training; knights were better trained.


                 - Read the last paragraph on page 18.


Unit 4
**84**


  - Explain that the word _title_ has several meanings. Students will be most
familiar with the definition “the name given to a book, movie, play, etc.” A title
is also the word or name given to a person based on his or her job or status.
This is the way the word _title_ is used here.


**Evaluative.** Point out the armor on the knight and on the horse in the image.
Armor protected knights and their horses from harm. Have students describe the
differences between the armor of the ordinary foot soldiers on page 17 and the
armor on the knight on page 18. What does the difference in armor tell you about
who could become a knight in the Middle Ages?


» Knights had better armor and fought on horseback, both of which were expensive,

so knights had to be from wealthy families.


Lesson 4 Knights and Castles
**85**


                 - Have a student read the first paragraph on page 19. Then have students flip
back to the image on page 18. Explain that the knight in the image on page
18 is holding a lance, which is mentioned in the paragraph they just read on
page 19.


**Inferential.** Based on the way it is used in this paragraph, what do you think the
word _aspiring_ means?


» “hoping to become a knight”


Unit 4
**86**


**Inferential.** Read the second paragraph on page 19 aloud. To groom and saddle a
horse means to clean and care for it and to put a saddle on its back. What are some
differences between a page and a squire?


» A squire had more responsibility than a page, and he learned more

challenging skills.


**Literal.** How did each step in a knight’s training prepare him for knighthood? Have
students record the answers to question 3 on Activity Page 4.2.


» They left their homes at a young age. This prepared them because it took many

years to become a knight, so they had to start at an early age.


They learned to use a sword, ride a horse, and wield a lance. These are some of the
basic skills a knight would use, and they had to learn them before moving on to
more challenging skills.


They later learned to fight while riding a horse and carrying a heavier lance. As
a knight, a young man would be required to fight on horseback while carrying a
heavy lance.



Challenge


Ask students to identify
the sentence or words
from p. 19 that helped
them identify differences
between pages and
squires.


Support


Ask leading questions,
such as “What kinds
of tasks does a page
perform?” to help students
think about the differences
between these jobs.



Lesson 4 Knights and Castles
**87**


**Literal.** Have a student read the first paragraph on page 20. What was the purpose
of the dubbing ceremony, and what took place during it?


» It was the ceremony during which a young man became a knight. The lord would

tap the knight on the shoulder with the flat part of his sword, and a priest might

bless the knight with a prayer.


**Literal.** Read the paragraph in the text box titled “The Way of the Knight.” What
is chivalry?


» Chivalry refers to the way knights were expected to behave.


Unit 4
**88**


How were knights expected to behave?


» Knights were expected to serve their lord; honor and protect the Church and

weaker members of society; treat knights captured in battle as honored guests.


**Inferential.** Read page 21 aloud. Explain that the word _charge_ has several meanings.
One meaning of the word _charge_ is “to supply with power or energy.” The word
_charge_ here means “to rush toward something.” Why is this section of text titled
“Charge!”?


» In a jousting match, knights would rush toward each other with lances.


Lesson 4 Knights and Castles
**89**


**Literal.** Why would a knight take part in a jousting match?


» He could prove his strength and fighting abilities; he could gain respect; he could

win a generous prize.


**Inferential.** You read that knights fought in jousting matches and that other
people came to watch the matches. How did those spectators feel about attending
the matches?


» Spectators liked watching the matches because they were exciting events.


Which statement from the text best supports the answer to this question? Have
students record the answers to question 4 on Activity Page 4.2.


» “For the privileged, attending the jousting matches was considered to be a day of

excitement and entertainment.”


Unit 4
**90**


  - Have a student read the first paragraph on page 22. In this paragraph, the
word _store_ means “to put away for future use.”


**Literal.** Read the last two paragraphs on page 22. Find three pieces of evidence
from the text that demonstrate how a castle might protect its inhabitants from an
enemy siege. Have students record the answers to question 5 on Activity Page 4.2.


» A castle had its own water supply; a drawbridge could be raised to prevent

enemies from entering the castle; a moat, often filled with water, would be difficult

to cross to reach the castle.


Lesson 4 Knights and Castles
**91**


**Literal.** Do you think castles were built more for comfort or for protection? Cite
evidence from the text to support your response.


» They were built more for protection. They were often made of stone, which was

strong but not comfortable, and many of the features of a castle were meant for

protection, including the moat and the drawbridge.


Unit 4
**92**


Lesson 4 Knights and Castles
**93**


**Inferential.** How does this image help you to visualize the following sentence?
“Castle walls sometimes enclosed a series of small buildings, like a little town.”


» Answers may vary but should use evidence from the image such as the high stone

walls surrounding the castle, the individual buildings lining the interior of the wall,

and the castle itself.


Unit 4
**94**


  - Read page 25 aloud.


**Literal.** What took place in the Great Hall in a castle?


» Family members and guests gathered in the Great Hall for meals and

entertainment, and servants slept there.


**Evaluative.** What is the key idea of this chapter? What details support your answer?


» Answers will vary but may include that there was a need for protection during the

Middle Ages. Castles had features to protect people. Knights and soldiers worked

for lords to protect them and the people on their lands.


  - As time permits, you may have students conduct independent research to

    - The moat was a deep trench. (nouns: moat, trench; adjective: deep)

  - Have students complete Activity Page 4.4 for homework.


**Prepositions and Prepositional Phrases**


  - Tell students that they will be learning about a part of speech called the
preposition.

  - Write _Where?_ on the board and tell students that today they will focus on
prepositions that answer _where_ questions.

  - Hold up a book with a pencil above it and ask students where the pencil is in
relation to the book.


above the book or on top of the book


  - Move the pencil to underneath the book and repeat the question.


» below or under the book


  - Write _above_ and _under_ on the board under _where?_ .


  - Ask students for other words that could describe where a pencil is in relation
to a book.


Answers will vary but may include: _on_, _in_, _inside_, _outside_, _behind_, _in front of_, _over_,
_beside_, _next to_, _between_, _near_, etc.


  - List students’ answers on the board under _where?_


  - Tell students that in full sentences, prepositions are usually part of
prepositional phrases, which are made up of a preposition followed by one or
more other words.

Language Development
Using Nouns and
Noun Phrases


Beginning
Give students one noun
(e.g., _castle_ ) and then,
using a relevant picture
from the Reader, have
them add an adjective that
describes the noun.


Intermediate
Have students expand
nouns by prompting them
to use the context of the
sentence instead of a
picture to add an adjective.


Advanced/Advanced High

Coach students to use the
new adjective they learned,
_influential_, to describe
a noun in a sentence
before they begin Activity
Page 4.4 independently.


~~**ELPS 3.D**~~




  - Underline the word _inside_, and then circle the words _inside the book_ . Tell
students that _inside the boo_ k is a prepositional phrase.


  - Direct students to the list of prepositions on the board. Have them take out a
sheet of paper and write three sentences containing prepositional phrases.


  - Break the class into pairs and have students exchange their sentences
with a partner. Then have them circle the prepositions and underline the
prepositional phrases in their partners’ sentences.


  - Have some students share their sentences with the class and ask others to
identify the prepositions and prepositional phrases in the sentences.


~~**MORPHOLOGY (15 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students will use their knowledge of the prefixes _un_ - and _non_ - and

root words to read and determine the meaning of unfamiliar words.

~~**TEKS 4.2.A.iv; TEKS 4.3.C**~~


**Introduce Prefixes un– and non–**


  - Review the definition of prefix: a prefix is a syllable or syllables placed at the
beginning of a root word that changes the meaning of the root word.


  - Briefly review the prefixes _un–_ and _non–,_ reminding students that both
prefixes mean “not.”


  - Remind students that the prefixes _un–_ and _non–_ are added to root words
that are adjectives. The prefixes _un–_ and _non–_ do not change the part of
speech of the words; the new words are still adjectives.


  - Tell students you will give them two word choices. Then you will read
a sentence, and students must decide which of the word choices the
sentence demonstrates.


  - Practice with the following example:


    - Familiar or unfamiliar? You are meeting someone for the first time.

  - Ask students if the sentence relates to the word _familiar_ or _unfamiliar_ .
( _unfamiliar_ because you have never met the person before)


**TEKS 4.2.A.iv** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words using knowledge of prefixes;
**TEKS 4.3.C** Determine the meaning of and use words with affixes such as mis-, sub-, -ment, and -ity/ty and roots
such as auto, graph, meter.



Unit 4
**100**


- Continue with the remaining examples.


  - _Happy or unhappy_ ? The hot sun melted my ice cream before I could eat
it. ( _unhappy_ )


  - _Equal or unequal_ ? The pizza was cut into eight slices that were the same
size. ( _equal_ )


  - _Common or uncommon_ ? All of the kids in the class wore the same color
shirt. ( _common_ )


  - _Verbal or nonverbal_ ? Diana put a finger to her lips to signal that we should
be quiet. ( _nonverbal_ )


  - _Threatening or nonthreatening_ ? The clouds in the sky were dark and the air
smelled damp. ( _threatening_ )


- Have students turn to Activity Page 4.5. Briefly review the directions and, if
time permits, tell students to complete it. If there is not time to complete it
during class, students should complete it for homework.

key words from the text
to include in the graphic
organizer (e.g., writing,
taxes, etc.).


Intermediate
Provide students with
teacher support for
paraphrasing after they
find the information they
want to include in their

Advanced/Advanced High

Have students work in
small, heterogeneous
groups to complete
the rest of the graphic
organizer. Students who
struggle can rely on peer
support.


~~**ELPS 1.C; ELPS 5.B**~~



**Primary Focus:** Students will use a graphic organizer to produce clear and coherent

writing that contrasts the life of a serf and that of a lord. ~~**TEKS 4.7.E**~~


~~**PRACTICE TAKING NOTES (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 2.6. They have already completed the
“Lords” column of the graphic organizer. Tell them they will now complete the
“Serfs” column.


  - Remind students that the Middle Ages text they have been reading is
informational text and that many text features (headings, captions, etc.) are
helpful in navigating the text. Tell students that the images in a chapter can
also be useful in locating information, as the images often relate to the text
around them.


  - As you model the process of scanning the text, have students follow along in
their Readers while you think aloud. Periodically call attention to the use of
nouns and adjectives as you model the process of scanning a text.


  - Note that the first category on the graphic organizer is “Homes.” Explain
that, in order to take notes about the types of homes serfs generally lived
in during the Middle Ages, students must scan the text and images for key
words and specific information. (For example, you might say something like
“First I am going to look for information about how serfs lived during the
Middle Ages, particularly about their homes. Some of this information will
come from the text, whereas other information might come from the images.
Scanning the chapter, I see the image of homes at the bottom of pages 11,
and note that the second paragraph on page 11 discusses serfs’ homes, so I
will start there.”)


  - As time allows, model how to complete the “Serfs” column of the graphic
organizer. Emphasize the importance of writing key information in the
shortest form possible and of paraphrasing, or writing the information
in students’ own words. Remind students that images and captions can
provide details as well. Students should write the page numbers of each
piece of evidence next to their paraphrased notes. The following chart shows
suggested paraphrasing of relevant passages from the text.


**TEKS 4.7.E** Interact with sources in meaningful ways such as notetaking, annotating, freewriting, or illustrating.



Unit 4
**102**


**Note:** The chart, with the inclusion of direct quotations from the text and

suggested paraphrasing, is provided for teacher reference. As you model, you

should read the direct quote from the text and describe how to transform

that quotation into a written paraphrase. Students should complete their

graphic organizers with paraphrased notes from the text and page numbers

indicating where the information came from.

starting with the main section of the text. Point out the section at the end of
the chapter titled “If You Were a Boy Serf.” Explain that this section provides
additional information on the life of a boy serf.


  - If necessary, you may allow time for students to complete the “Serfs”
column of the graphic organizer at the beginning of the next writing lesson.
Or you may choose to assign completing the “Serfs” column of the graphic

in a medieval town.


~~**PARTNER READING: CHAPTER 4 (20 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** This chapter may be especially challenging for some students,

particularly English learners and those with other needs. Those students will

benefit from being paired with a stronger reader. In addition, this chapter

will be reread in Lesson 6 as a teacher read-aloud, so students will have

additional exposure to this content.


 - Pair students to read and discuss the chapter.


 - Explain that both students will read the first page silently, and then one
partner will read that page aloud. Next, they will both read the second page
silently, and then the other partner will read that page aloud, and so on.
Students can ask their partner for help with sounding out or defining words
as necessary.


 - You may wish to provide guiding questions for students to periodically stop
and discuss the answers with their partners.


 - Have students complete Activity Page 5.2 with their partners while they read.


 - Tell students that they are expected to write legibly in cursive.


~~**DISCUSS THE CHAPTER AND LESSON WRAP-UP (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Review the correct answers to Activity Page 5.2 with the whole class. You
may wish to select different students to read each question and share their
responses, including the page number where the answer was located.


1. **Literal.** Where did most people live in the early part of the Middle Ages?

Where did people move between 1000 AD and 1350 AD?


» They lived in the countryside on manors, and then they moved to towns. (page 29)


2. **Inferential.** How did trade change where and how people lived during the

Middle Ages?


» Trade led merchants to create more jobs, so some people moved off the manors

and into towns. (page 29)


3. **Literal.** As more people became involved in trade and commerce, what

group grew in importance?



Unit 4
**112**


» A group of merchants and craftsmen called the middle class grew in importance.

(page 29)


4. **Inferential.** What was the connection between towns in the Middle Ages

and local lords?


» Local lords received money and goods from the craftsmen and merchants, but the

lords gave some towns special charters that allowed them to make some of their

own laws. (page 31)


5. **Literal.** List at least two problems that emerged because of people moving

into towns during the Middle Ages.


» People lived in small houses crowded together; diseases spread quickly, especially

those, like the Black Death, that were carried by rats; water supplies were polluted;

fires often broke out and were difficult to control; and most people did not have

access to toilets and had to use chamber pots. (page 32)


6. **Inferential.** Write the following three steps on the line in the order in which

they would take place as one worked to become a master craftsman:

journeyman, master craftsman, apprentice.


» apprentice, journeyman, master craftsman (pages 33, 34)


7. **Inferential.** Part A: You read that women in the Middle Ages had few legal

rights. However, regardless of whether they were privileged or not, all

women had a similar role. What role did all women share?


» D. All women managed their families’ needs daily. (page 35)

**Inferential.** Part B: Which statement from the text best supports the answer to
Part A?


» D. “Regardless of whether they were part of the privileged class or were serfs, as

important members of their households, women managed their families’ daily

needs.” (page 35)


8. **Evaluative.** Think-Pair-Share. What were some of the positive things about

life in towns during the Middle Ages? What were some of the negative things

about life in towns during the Middle Ages? Remind students to refer to the

T-chart they used for note taking.


» positive things: more jobs available to people than were available on manors;

increased commerce, or trade; growth of a middle class; more people became

wealthy as a result of trade; people could buy things from merchants in the town;

and a banking system and universities developed in towns


» negative things: small, crowded houses; disease-ridden towns; polluted water

supplies; frequent fires; contents of chamber pots thrown into the streets

the graphic organizer from the previous writing lesson.


**Model Drafting an Informative Paragraph**


  - Tell students you will briefly review how to use notes from the graphic
organizer on Activity Page 2.6 to compose a paragraph describing the life of a
serf during the Middle Ages.


  - Briefly review the structure of an informative paragraph, using the Elements
of an Informative Paragraph Poster on the wall.


  - After students complete the “Serfs” column of the graphic organizer, guide
them to reach the conclusion that serfs worked for powerful lords. This sort
of general summary statement about serfs during the Middle Ages makes for
a great topic sentence because it describes what the paragraph will be about
and helps the writer to stay focused and to write about one consistent topic.
Remind students that they can revise the topic sentence after the paragraph
has been drafted, if needed.


  - Point out that a great sentence starter begins with the topic of this unit.
Combining a phrase about the unit with the paragraph topic is a great way to
start the paragraph. Model writing a topic sentence on the board/chart paper
using one the following examples:


    - During the Middle Ages, serfs worked on the lord’s land.


    - In Europe in the Middle Ages, serfs were controlled by powerful lords.


    - In medieval Europe, the majority of people were serfs and had little power.

  - Remind students that a good topic sentence states the main idea of
the paragraph.


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete the assignments; **TEKS 4.12.B** Compose informational texts, including brief
compositions that convey information about a topic, using a clear central idea and genre characteristics and craft; **TEKS 4.11.B**
Develop drafts into a focused, structured, and coherent piece of writing by (i) organizing with purposeful structure, including an
introduction, transitions, and a conclusion; (ii) developing an engaging idea with relevant details.

Beginning
Support students as they
draft the informative
paragraph. Students
should refer to the
Elements of an Informative
Paragraph Poster to guide
paragraph structure.


Intermediate
Have students work in
a small, heterogeneous
group to draft the
paragraph in collaboration.


Advanced/Advanced High

Provide transition words
as sentence frames for
students to build from
while writing their detail
sentences, e.g., “During
the Middle Ages . . .”


~~**ELPS 4.C; ELPS 5.F**~~




 - Have students write a topic sentence for their paragraphs.


 - Next, model how to create detail sentences using notes from the graphic
organizer. There are five categories on the graphic organizer (“Homes,”
“Work,” “Clothing,” “Food,” “Amount of Power”), but students should choose
the same three categories that they used for the paragraph about lords.
Circle the category labels “Homes”, “Work”, and “Amount of Power” on
the displayed graphic organizer and tell students that they will use these
categories to create detail sentences.


 - Remind students that the graphic organizer is a useful tool that highlights
just how different the lives of lords and serfs were from each other during the
Middle Ages. The paragraphs students write should show these differences
as well.


 - Point out that the notes in the graphic organizer are paraphrased fragments
(in our own words), and they can be transformed to create the three detail
sentences: one about homes, one about work, and one about power.


 - Remind students that complete sentences have subjects (who or what the
sentence is about) and predicates (what the subject is doing). Sentence
fragments can be transformed into sentences by the addition of the part of
the sentence that is missing—either a subject or predicate.


 - Model how to transform the notes on homes into a detail sentence by finding
the “Homes” category on the graphic organizer and deciding what needs to
be added to change the note into a complete sentence with a subject and
predicate. You may wish to identify the adjectives and nouns in the notes for
students. (nouns: houses, roofs; adjectives: simple, one-room, straw)


 - Write your first detail sentence after your topic sentence.


   - They lived in simple one-room mud houses with straw roofs.

 - Tell students that they can add transition words and/or reorder their detail
sentences after all the detail sentences have been drafted.


~~**PRACTICE WRITING (25 MIN.)**~~


 - Guide students through the process of drafting detail sentences from their
notes on the topic of work. First, have students refer to the “Work” column on
their graphic organizer and find the notes they took about serfs during the
Middle Ages. Students should read their notes (emphasize that notes should
be in their own words) and decide what needs to be added to turn a note into
a sentence: the subject (who or what the sentence is about) or predicate
(what the subject is doing).



Unit 4
**116**


  - Have students share their detail sentence about work with a partner. They
should check each other’s sentences to make sure they are complete (with
a subject and predicate) and that they describe the work of a serf in the
Middle Ages.


  - Next, inform students that they will work independently to create their last
detail sentence, about the amount of power serfs had in the Middle Ages.
Students should follow the process you modeled in this lesson.


  - Tell students they may also add transition words to vary the beginnings of
sentences. They can reorder detail sentences as necessary to make their
paragraphs sound better.


  - Tell students that they are expected to write legibly in cursive.


  - Circulate and check in with students to support them as they write. Model
cursive letter formation if needed.


~~**LESSON WRAP-UP (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Have students complete their draft of the serfs paragraph for homework.
Explain that they should add transition words, where appropriate, to begin
sentences, and they should also add a concluding sentence that restates the
topic sentence in a different way.


  - Call students’ attention to the Informative Paragraph Rubric on
Activity Page 5.3. Explain that this is the rubric you will be using to evaluate
their paragraphs.

    - How did the growth of trade during the Middle Ages affect the way
people lived?


    - This question also points out the central idea of this chapter, that the
growth of trade during the Middle Ages affected the way people lived. As
we read this chapter, we will look for details to help us answer the question
and support the central idea.


Lesson 6 Manors and Towns
**123**


                - Read page 27 aloud.


**Evaluative.** Why would there have been walls around the town and gates through
which everyone must pass?


» Answers may vary, but may focus on the need for protection.


**Literal.** Have students describe some things they would have seen or heard if they
were standing in a street in a medieval town.


» Answers may vary, but may include gates, walls, small houses, crowds of people,

Unit 4
**124**


**Literal.** Have students look at the image on page 28 and describe some of the
things they see.


Lesson 6 Manors and Towns
**125**


- Read the first paragraph on page 29 aloud.





**Literal.** What detail in that paragraph supports the central idea that the growth of
trade during the Middle Ages affected the way people lived?


» More people left the countryside to work in towns.


                 - Read the rest of page 29 aloud.


**Inferential.** What was the link between trade and a middle class?


» As trade grew, more people became involved in commerce. The merchants and

craftsmen who were involved in trade prospered so they were no longer as poor as

serfs or peasants. But they were still not as wealthy or powerful as lords.


**Literal.** What additional details in this section support the central idea?


» Towns grew as the middle class created successful businesses and jobs.


Unit 4
**126**


  - Read page 30 aloud.


**Literal.** What types of craftsmen existed in the Middle Ages? (Remind students to
refer to the images as well as the text).

**127**


                 - Read page 31 aloud.


                  - Point to the image of the charter. A charter is a document that gives certain
rights to a group of people. In this situation, the charter was given to a group
of people to start a new town and to allow the wealthy and influential people
in that town to make their own laws.


**Inferential.** Why did the author include this image of a charter?


» To show readers what an actual document of the time period looks like.


Unit 4
**128**


**Evaluative.** Why might this change in the decision-making process change the
feudal system?


» Under the feudal system, kings and noblemen such as lords paid people who

worked for them with land and protection. In turn, lower-ranked people, such as

serfs, promised loyalty to the lord. This system gave a lot of power to the lord over

the lives of serfs, but, with people in towns making their own laws, the power of

the lords began to weaken.


**Literal.** What role did churches play in setting up universities?


» Wealthy churches helped establish universities.


Lesson 6 Manors and Towns
**129**


                 - Read the first paragraph of page 32 aloud.


**Inferential.** In chapter 1, you heard about the disease that rats spread during the
Middle Ages. What disease did they spread? Remind students rats spread this
disease because fleas infected with the disease lived on the rats and traveled
around with the rats.


» The Black Death, or the plague


                 - Read aloud the rest of page 32 to finish the last paragraph that carries over to
the next page.


Unit 4
**130**


**Literal.** What additional details in this section support the central idea?


» It was not long before many European towns and cities became terribly

overcrowded. This brought disease and fires.

them in until they could be caught.


Lesson 6 Manors and Towns
**131**


                - Read page 33 aloud.


**Inferential.** What is an apprentice?


» someone who learns a skill or trade by working with a skilled craftsman for a

period of time, usually for no pay


**Inferential.** You just read the sentence “It is unlikely that you will return home again
during your apprenticeship years.” Based on what you learned about the prefix _un_ –,
what does the word _unlikely_ mean? Did apprentices usually return to their homes
during their apprenticeships?


» The prefix _un_                     - means “not,” so the word _unlikely_ means it was not likely.

Apprentices usually did not return to their homes.


Unit 4
**132**


 - Read page 34 aloud.


**Inferential.** What is one difference between being an apprentice and being a
journeyman?


» Journeymen were paid for their work, but apprentices worked for no pay.


**Inferential.** What are the three stages, in order, for becoming a master craftsman?


» apprentice, journeyman, and master craftsman


Lesson 6 Manors and Towns
**133**


                - Read page 35 aloud.


**Literal.** The word _deceased_ in this sentence means “dead.” A widow is someone
whose husband has died. What could a widow who did not have any sons do that
was not usually done by other women?


» Widows without sons could manage their deceased husbands’ land.


**Inferential.** (Direct students’ attention to the image of Empress Matilda and the
text related to that image.) Would you say the woman pictured here was privileged
or not? On what do you base your decision?


» She was privileged. Her clothing looks to be in good condition, and she is wearing

a crown. Also, the text says she was the daughter of a king.

~~**LESSON WRAP-UP (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Give students one minute to jot down 1-2 questions they have after listening
to the read-aloud. Explain that at the end of the lesson wrap-up, they will
have an opportunity to share their unanswered questions for the class to
discuss.


 - Use the following questions to discuss the chapter.


**Note:** Question 1 relates to The Big Question of the chapter: How did the

growth of trade during the Middle Ages affect the way people lived?


1. **Inferential.** Let’s review the details collected while reading. How do they

support the central idea of this chapter?


» Answers may vary, but should include details such as trade fueled the growth

of towns. Successful businesses created jobs, especially for skilled craftsmen.

The merchants and craftsmen created guilds. The crowded towns and cities had

problems like diseases and fires.


2. **Literal.** What groups were included in the growing middle class?


» merchants and craftsmen


3. **Inferential.** (Ask students to record their answers to this question on

Activity Page 6.1.) Look at the image of a medieval manor on page 11 and

the image of a medieval town on page 28. Based on these images, and on

the text, what was life like for serfs on a manor during the Middle Ages?

(Record that information in the “Life on a Manor” column.) What was life like

as a merchant in a town during the Middle Ages? (Record that information

in the “Life in a Town” column.)


» Answers may vary, but may include the following:


     - Life on a manor: working in fields, tending to crops or livestock; living in a small
house; working from sunup to sundown; being controlled by the lord


     - Life in a town: opening shop at six a.m.; living in a house very close to the houses
of others; seeing a lot of activity on a daily basis; seeing rats and other animals
roaming the streets; using chamber pots, which were emptied out into the
street; experiencing fires frequently; buying and selling different goods made
by different craftsmen; seeing universities develop because a banking system
helped wealthy churches create them


4. **Evaluative.** Think-Pair-Share. Today you heard about the life of an

apprentice craftsman during the Middle Ages. Earlier, you read about

what it was like to be a serf. Would you have preferred to be a serf or an

apprentice? Why? Use information from the text to support your answer.


» Answers may vary, but should include information supported by the text.



Unit 4
**136**


 - Review the information students recorded on Activity Page 6.1 by asking the
following questions and having students respond by saying, “That took place
on a manor,” or “That took place in a town.”


Check for Understanding


Collect or survey Activity Page 6.1 to ensure that each student has at least
two accurate details written down in each column. If not, ask students to go
back into the Reader and find more details about life in the town or manor.


1. Where were guilds established?


» That took place in a town.


2. Where did apprentices learn a new craft?


» That took place in a town.


3. Where did a lord have great power over the everyday life of the people

he governed?


» That took place on a manor.


4. Where did serfs work in the field from very early in the morning until the

sun set?


» That took place on a manor.


5. Where did a middle class grow in importance?


» That took place in a town.


6. Where were universities established?


» That took place in a town.


 - Provide time for students to share the questions they generated after
listening to the read aloud. This can be done during small group time or
independent work time as well.

Lesson 6 Manors and Towns
**137**


~~**WORD WORK: EMERGE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the chapter, you read, “New jobs emerged, and, as a result, more and more
people left the countryside to live and work in towns.”


2. Say the word _emerge_ with me.


3. _Emerge_ means to become known or come into existence.


4. The beautiful butterfly emerged from the cocoon.


5. Many different things emerge from other things. For example, a chick
emerges from an egg. A dolphin emerges from the ocean when it jumps in
the air. What have you seen emerge from something else? Be sure to use the
word _emerge_ in your response.


                  - Ask two or three students to use the target word in a sentence. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to make complete sentences:
“I saw a ___ emerge from ___.”


6. What part of speech is the word _emerge_ ?


» verb


                 - Use an Antonym activity for follow-up.


                 - An antonym, or word with the opposite meaning, of the word _emerged_ is
_disappeared_ . I will read several sentences and if the sentence describes
something that has emerged, say, “Emerged.” If the sentence describes
something that has disappeared, say, “Disappeared.”


1. After a few warm spring days, a pink bud (emerged/disappeared) from the
green stems in the garden.


» emerged


2. Sasha (emerged/disappeared) as a leader of the class.


» emerged


3. As the weather got warmer, the snow (emerged/disappeared).


» disappeared


4. After several rainy days, the sun finally (emerged/disappeared) from behind
the clouds.

##### Language


~~**GRAMMAR (20 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students will exhibit understanding of the function of an adverb

and its relationship to a verb by identifying the verb that an adverb is describing in a

given sentence. ~~**[TEKS 4.3.C; TEKS 4.11.D.v]**~~


Students will correctly use the homophones _to, too_, and _two_ . ~~**TEKS 4.3.D**~~


Students will use resources to determine syllabication. ~~**TEKS 4.3.A**~~


  - Using the answer key at the back of the Teacher Guide, review Activity Page
4.4, which students were assigned as homework after Lesson 4.


**Introduce Verbs and Adverbs**


  - Tell students that today they will focus on specific parts of speech called
verbs and adverbs. Parts of speech are categories, or groups of words, based
on their function in a sentence. Direct students to the poster you prepared in
advance and read it.

  - Explain that action verbs are words that describe actions. Have students
provide verbs that describe actions and record their answers on the board/
chart paper (e.g., _walk, run, jump, talk_ ).

  - Explain that adverbs are words that describe verbs. Adverbs provide detail
about verbs, by telling how the action of a verb happens.

  - Explain that the word _adverb_ has the word _verb_ in it, which may help them
remember which part of speech adverbs describe.

  - Ask students what other part of speech is a describing word and what it
describes. (an adjective; adjectives describe nouns.)

  - Tell students that many adverbs end with the suffix _–ly_ . Adverbs are often
created by adding _–ly_ to an adjective.




- Tell students the suffix _–ly_ means “in a ___ way,” with the blank being the
adjective. Adverbs with _–ly_ describe how the action of a verb happens.



___



~~**TEKS 4.3.C**~~




  - Write the word _quiet_ on the board and tell students it is an adjective. Have
students orally provide several examples of phrases with the adjective _quiet_
describing different nouns (e.g., _the quiet boy, a quiet afternoon_, etc.).


  - Add _–ly_ to _quiet_ to make the adverb _quietly_ . _Quietly_ means “in a quiet way”


**TEKS 4.3.C** Determine the meaning of and use words with affixes such as mis-, sub-, -ment, and -ity/ty and roots such as
auto, graph, meter; **TEKS 4.11.D.v** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including adverbs that convey frequency
and adverbs that convey degree; **TEKS 4.3.D** Identify, use, and explain the meaning of homophones such as reign/rain;
**TEKS 4.3.A** Use print or digital resources to determine meaning, syllabication, and pronunciation.

and describes how an action takes place. Have students orally provide
several examples of phrases with the adverb _quietly_ describing different
verbs. (e.g., _talk quietly, hum quietly_, etc.)


- Read aloud the first sentence from the board/chart paper and have students
add an adverb to the blank so it describes how the action takes place.


  - My brother and I washed the dishes ___ so we could make it to soccer
practice on time.


- Write the word _quick_ on the board, explaining that it is an adjective (e.g.,
_quick nap, quick trip_, etc.) Tell students that the meaning of the word _quick_
makes sense in the above sentence, but _quick_ must be changed from an
adjective to an adverb so it describes the verb _washed_ .


- Ask students how they can change the adjective _quick_ to an adverb. (by
adding _–ly_ )


- Write the word _quickly_ in the blank. Reread the complete sentence to
students.


- Ask students to identify the verb ( _washed_ ) and draw a wiggly line under it.


- Ask students to identify which word describes how _my brother and I_ washed.
( _quickly_ ) Write the abbreviation for _adverb_ ( _adv._ ) above the word _quickly_ .
Draw an arrow from the adverb _quickly_ to the verb _washed_, indicating that
_quickly_ describes _washed_ .


- Follow the same procedures for the remaining sentences you prepared in
advance. It is important to note that the adverb may not be in the same place
in every sentence. Point this out when discussing the other sentences. (In the
first two sentences, the adverb comes after the verb it describes, whereas in
the third sentence the adverb comes at the beginning of the sentence.)


  - My teacher read the directions for the exam slowly, making sure we
understood every word.


  - Nervously, the little girl sang the National Anthem in front of the big crowd.


  - What change should be made to this sentence? “We walked careful on the
icy bridge, taking each step with great care.


A. Change great to grate


B. Change icy to icily


C. Change walked to walking


D. Change careful to carefully


- Have students turn to Activity Page 6.2 and review the example with them.
Then complete the first sentence as a teacher-guided activity. Consider
using the following procedure:



Unit 4
**140**


    - Select a student to read the first sentence aloud.


    - Ask students to identify the verb in the sentence and underline it with a
wiggly line.


    - Ask students to read the adjective that will be changed to an adverb for
the sentence. (The adjective is listed under each blank.) Then, ask them to
say this word as an adverb by adding – _ly_ and write the word in the blank.


    - Have students explain how the adverb describes the verb, just as they
did with the sentences on the board. Tell them to write the abbreviation
for _adverb_ ( _adv._ ) above the adverb and draw an arrow from the adverb to
the verb.


    - Then, have students answer the question after the sentence.

  - Have students complete Activity Page 6.2 independently. If more time is
needed, have them finish it for homework.


_**To, Too**_ **and** _**Two**_


  - Write the following sentences on the board:


    - Mrs. Parker read to her twin girls. When she babysat the twins, Elsie read
to the two sisters too.


  - Have a student read the sentences out loud. Ask the class what three words
all sound the same but have different meanings and spellings.


» _to, too_ and _two_


  - Ask students what words like _to_, _two_, and _too_, that sound the same but have
different spellings and meanings, are called.


» homophones


  - Write _to_ on the board and remind students that in Lesson 4 they learned that
_to_ was a preposition.


  - Ask students for sentences using the word _to_ .


  - Write _two_ on the board and ask students what the word means.


» the number after one


  - Ask students for sentences using the word _two_ .


  - Write _too_ on the board and ask students what the word means.

both the number and its
homophone.


» _four_, _for_, and _fore_ ;
_eight_ and _ate_



Lesson 6 Manors and Towns
**141**


~~**MORPHOLOGY (15 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students will use their knowledge of morphology and the prefix

_en_              - to accurately read and determine the meaning of unknown words.


~~**TEKS 4.2.A.iv; TEKS 4.3.C**~~


**Introduce Prefix en–**


                 - Read the Prefixes Poster, reminding students that prefixes are added to the
beginnings of root words to make new words.

                 - Remind students that, in previous lessons, they learned about English root
words with prefixes added to them. Briefly review the prefixes _un–_ and _non–_,
both meaning “not.” Provide examples of words with the prefixes _un–_ and
_non–_ (e.g., _unhappy_, _unfamiliar_, _nonessential_, _nontoxic_, etc.).

                  - Tell students they will learn about the prefix _en–_ .

                   - Write the prefix _en–_ on the Prefixes Poster and point out that it is
pronounced /en/.

                  - Explain that _en–_ means “in” or “to make.” Write these meanings on the
poster.

                  - Tell students that words with the prefix _en–_ can be nouns or verbs, but are
usually verbs. Students will need to examine how these words are used in
sentences to help them determine the part of speech.

                  - Explain that when the prefix _en–_ is added to English root words, the part of
speech of the new words changes to a verb, no matter what part of speech
the root word is.

                 - Write the word _sure_ on the board/chart paper. Briefly discuss the meaning
of the word and then use it in a sentence. ( _Sure_ means “certain.” “I was sure I
put my homework in my backpack before breakfast.”)

                  - Add the prefix _en–_ to _sure_ and have students read the prefix, read the new
word, and then discuss the meaning of the new word. (to make sure or to
make certain)

                 - Share the following example of the use of _enlarged_ in a sentence:


                        - My teacher enlarged the homework activity page so we could all see it
easily on the board.

                 - Also share the following sentence from the Reader demonstrating the use of
the word _ensure_ :


                        - Most people in the Middle Ages focused on what they owed the local lord
in the way of payment, and how to ensure their place in heaven.


**TEKS 4.2.A.iv** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words using knowledge of prefixes; **TEKS 4.3.C** Determine
the meaning of and use words with affixes such as mis-, sub-, -ment, and -ity/ty an d roots such as auto, graph, and meter.


Unit 4
**142**


 - Write the word _enamor_ on the board. Ask students to identify and read the
prefix. ( _en_ –) Then have students read the entire word.


 - Ask students again what the prefix _en–_ means. (“in” or “to make”)


 - Point out that the word _enamor_ does not have an English root word.
( _Amor_ is not an English root; it is a Latin root.)


 - Discuss the meaning of _enamor_ and note the part of speech. (“to charm”;
verb)


 - Share the following sentence to demonstrate the use of the word _enamor_ :

   - We were so enamored with the island that we vacationed there year
after year.


 - Continue in this manner with the remaining _en_  - words, using the following
chart as a guide.
















|English Root<br>Word|Meaning|Affixed Word|Meaning|Sentence|

- Have students turn to Activity Page 6.3. Do the first few items as a
teacher-guided activity and have students complete the rest of the items
independently. If more time is needed, have students complete the activity
page for homework.



~~**SPELLING (15 MIN.)**~~



~~**TEKS 4.2.B.i; TEKS 4.2.B.iii; TEKS 4.2.B.iv; TEKS 4.3.A**~~



**Introduce Spelling Words**


 - Explain that students will practice 10 words related to the content of _The_
_Middle Ages_ . These words do not follow one single spelling pattern. Tell
students they will be assessed on the words in Lesson 10.


 - Introduce the words by writing them on the board/chart paper. First say the
word aloud, and then sound out each syllable, naming each letter aloud as
you write it. Continue syllable by syllable until the word is spelled correctly.
You may wish to use the pronunciation chart to guide students in saying
the words. Encourage students to use their knowledge of syllable division
patterns to spell and read words they encounter in texts.


**Note:** Remember to point out specific spelling patterns in each word and

their relationship to the sounds and spellings on the Individual Code Chart.



9. transform


10.  unravel



1. acquire


2. establish


3. loyalty


4. promote



5. retreat


6. seize


7. surrender


8. thrive



**Note:** As you introduce and write each word, it may be helpful if you point

out particular spelling patterns within each word and show students where

these spellings are reflected on the Individual Code Chart. Reinforce that

print and digital resources such as dictionaries can provide information

on meaning, syllabication, and pronunciation. Choose 1-2 spelling words

and model for students how to use an online dictionary to determine

syllabication and word meaning. Demonstrate how to find the syllables in a

word, as well as the pronunciation tool.


Draw students’ attention to the syllable type within each word, as well as how

to divide the words into syllables. For example, when writing the word _acquire_,

show students that you would divide the word between the two consonants

(ac/quire). Explain that this helps us to decode and encode unknown words.


**TEKS 4.2.B** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open
syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables;
(iii) spelling multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns; (iv) spelling words using advanced knowledge of
syllable division patterns; **TEKS 4.3.A** Use print or digital resources to determine meaning, syllabication, and pronunciation.



Unit 4
**144**


Likewise, draw students’ attention to the different syllable types. For example,

when writing the word _loyalty_, point out that _oy_ is a diphthong, which means

the two letters make a gliding sound. As you write the word _retreat_ and _seize_,

have students notice the vowel team _ea_ and _ei_ . Explain that when decoding

unknown words, it is helpful to isolate the vowel sound first.

|Pronunciation/Syllabication|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|**Word**|**CK Code**|**Syllable Type**|
|acquire|/ə*quier/|ə*digraph|
|establish|/es*tab*lish/|closed*closed*closed|

|thrive|/thriev/|digraph|
|transform|/tranz*form/|closed *r-controlled|
|unravel|/un*rav*əl/|closed*closed*ə|



 - After writing and pronouncing the words, use the following chart to define
each word and provide an example of how to use it in a sentence:







|Spelling Word|Definition|Example Sentence|
|---|---|---|
|acquire|to get|I will acquireall the supplies we need for<br>the project.|
|establish|to put and settle into<br>place|The teacher had to establish a “one at a<br>time” rule because too many people were<br>climbing on the slide at the same time.|

Lesson 7 The Power of the Church in the Middle Ages
**165**


~~**LESSON WRAP-UP (10 MIN.)**~~


                  - Use the following questions for discussion.


**Note:** Question 1 relates to The Big Question of the chapter.


1. **Inferential.** What practices from the Middle Ages show the influence and

power of the Church?


» People went to church often and created holy days to mark important religious

events; they built large cathedrals; they went on pilgrimages; some people

devoted their lives to the Church; the Church grew wealthy; and the Church

influenced political decisions and supported or opposed kings.


                 - Ask students to look at the image of Chartres Cathedral on page 39.


2. **Inferential.** When you see the size and architectural details of churches

built during the Middle Ages, and know that they took many, many years

to build, what does that tell you about the importance of the Church in the

lives of Europeans who lived during that time period?


» The Church was very important because people were willing to put so much time,

effort, and money into making such elaborate buildings.


3. **Inferential.** Why would someone in the Middle Ages decide to become a

monk?


» Answers may vary, but may include the fact that the Church played an important

role in the lives of people in the Middle Ages. It was a way for someone like

a serf to have a better life. Monks were assured of a place to sleep, clothing,

food, medical care, and an education. Being a monk offered some security and

protection from the challenges of medieval life.


4. **Evaluative.** Think-Pair-Share. How would the lives of a monk and a serf in

the Middle Ages differ? How would they be similar?


» Answers may vary, but may include the fact that monks went through a training

period in which they learned to read and write. Monks took part in a ceremony in

which they vowed to dedicate their lives to God. Serfs were controlled by a lord.

Serfs lived on a manor. Monks lived in a monastery.


» Answers may vary, but may include the fact that both worked hard for many hours

of the day. Both often worked outside to grow food.


                 - Have students share the information discussed with their partner in the
Think-Pair-Share activity.


Unit 4
**166**


Check for Understanding


Tell students they will play a game called “Monk or Serf?” You will say a
fact, and students will hold their fingers up whether they think that fact is
true for a monk, a serf, or both. One finger: monk; two fingers: serf; three
fingers: both. Read the facts you prepared in advance, and ask follow-up
questions if you notice misconceptions.


  - Have students take home Activity Page 7.7 to read and complete
for homework. Remind them to complete the assignment in cursive.


~~**WORD WORK: DEVOTE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the chapter, you read, “Monks were men who chose to live apart from
society and to devote their lives to the Church.”


2. Say the word _devote_ with me.


3. _Devote_ means “to give one’s time or attention to something.”


4. Sandra and her brother love to play basketball, so they devote at least five
hours a week to practicing.


5. What activity do you devote a lot of time to? Be sure to use the word _devote_
in your response.


  - Ask two or three students to use the target word in a sentence. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to make complete sentences: “I
devote a lot of time to ___.”


6. What part of speech is the word _devote_ ?


» verb


  - Use a Synonyms activity for follow-up. What does the word _devote_ mean?
What are some words that are synonyms, or words that have a similar
meaning, of devote? Prompt students to provide words like _pledge_, _commit_,
and _vow_ . Have students turn to a partner and create sentences using the
synonyms they provided.

**Lesson 7: The Power of the Church in the Middle Ages**
##### Writing


**Primary Focus:** Students will use a graphic organizer to produce clear and



45 M



coherent writing that compares the lives of medieval knights, craftsmen, monks,


~~**REVIEW (5 MIN.)**~~


                 - Tell students that you are returning the serfs paragraph they completed
for homework, along with a completed evaluation rubric. Suggest that
each student take several minutes to read any comments, as well as the
completed evaluation rubric. Explain that while this feedback applies
specifically to the informative paragraph students wrote about serfs,
understanding the specific areas where they need improvement will help
them as they continue to write other paragraphs. Let students know that
later in today’s lesson, you will go around as they work, to provide additional
feedback individually.


                  - Remind students that the particular type of paragraph that they have practiced
writing during the last several lessons was called an informative or explanatory
paragraph, the purpose of which was to provide factual information about a
particular topic. Explain that, in addition to providing information, yet another
purpose for writing may be to persuade the reader toward a certain point of view
or opinion. Tell students that they will start working today, and through the next
several lessons, to learn how to write an opinion paragraph and state an opinion.


~~**MODEL TAKING NOTES (10 MIN.)**~~


                  - Point to the “If You Were a Boy Serf” section that comes at the end of
chapter 2. Several other chapters contain similar sections. Tell students
these sections describe people in the Middle Ages and their place in society.


                 - Remind students they have read about serfs, lords, knights, craftsmen,
monks, and nuns. They have taken notes and written descriptive paragraphs
about serfs and lords.


                  - Tell students they will use a graphic organizer to gather information from the
Reader about knights, craftsmen, monks, and nuns. This graphic organizer
will help them determine which character they would choose to be during the
Middle Ages.


**TEKS 4.7.D** Retell, paraphrase, or summarize texts in ways that maintain meaning and logical order; **TEKS 4.7.E** Interact with
sources in meaningful ways such as notetaking, annotating, freewriting, or illustrating.


Unit 4
**168**


 - Assign students to one of three or four groups for note taking: knights
(chapter 3), craftsmen (chapter 4), monks (chapter 5), and nuns (chapter 5
and page 41). Within each group, you may wish to have students work
as partners, with some partners starting with the “Homes” category and
working from the top of the list down, and others starting with the “Amount
of Power” category, working from the bottom of the list up.


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 7.2. They have already completed a
similar graphic organizer for lords and serfs.


 - Remind students that the Middle Ages text they have been reading is
informational text and there are many text features (headings, captions,
etc.) that are helpful in navigating the text. Tell students the images can
also be useful in locating information, as the images often relate to the text
around them.


 - Have students turn to chapter 3, “Gloomy Castles and Jousting Knights,”
and have them follow along as you review how to take notes from a text. Tell
students to begin with the section subtitled “If You Were a Knight.”


 - Briefly model how to scan the text to locate information for the graphic
organizer. Using the Knights, Craftsmen, Monks, and Nuns Graphic Organizer,
model taking notes in the “Knights” column.


   - For example, the first category is “Homes.” Tell students that in order to
find specific information about the type of homes knights generally lived in
during the Middle Ages, they must scan the text for key words (such as _live_
or _home_ ) and specific information.


   - Scanning the first paragraph of the “If You Were a Knight” section, point
out that the second sentence contains the keywords _home_ and _live_ .
Remind students they should always paraphrase notes, or write them in
their own words. (“lived with the lord training them”) Have students copy
your paraphrase in their graphic organizers. Write the page numbers of
where they found each piece of evidence next to your paraphrased notes.


~~**PRACTICE TAKING NOTES (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind groups of their assigned role, text chapter, and the category they
should start with on the graphic organizer. If you have divided your class
into four groups, so that the categories of “Monks” and “Nuns” are being
addressed by separate groups of students, ask each group to circle either
“Monks” or “Nuns” in the header on Activity Page 7.2, to show which category
they will take notes on.

Lesson 7 The Power of the Church in the Middle Ages
**169**


- Emphasize the importance of writing key information in the shortest form
possible, and of paraphrasing, or writing the information in their own words.
Remind students that images and captions can provide details as well.
Students should write the page numbers of where they found each piece of
evidence next to their paraphrased notes.


- Advise students to begin with the “If You Were . . .” section (or chapter 5 and
page 41 if taking notes on nuns), but scan other parts of the chapter to fill in
any gaps in information.


- Circulate and check in with students to support them as they write. Also,
use this opportunity to provide additional feedback to individual students
regarding the serfs paragraph they wrote.


**Note:** These charts, with the inclusion of direct quotes from the text and

suggested paraphrasing, are provided for teacher reference. As you model,

you should read the direct quote from the text or a text feature and describe

how to transform that quote into a written paraphrase. Students should

complete their graphic organizers with paraphrased notes from the text and

page numbers where the information came from.

**Primary Focus:** Students will participate in a small group discussion of “The Power of

the Church” and cite evidence from the text. ~~**[ TEKS 4.1.A; TEKS 4.6.B; TEKS 4.7.G ]**~~


~~**REVIEW (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Using the Answer Key at the back of this Teacher Guide, review student
responses to Activity Page 7.7, which was assigned for homework.

  - Ask students the following questions to review additional details from the
previous lesson:


1. Which Church was powerful in Europe during the Middle Ages?


» The Christian Church


2. The religion of Christianity is based on whose teachings?


» Jesus

  - Remind students that Jesus of Nazareth was born during the Roman Empire,
hundreds of years before the beginning of the Middle Ages.


3. Who is the leader of the Christian Church based in Rome?


» The pope

  - Ask students to look at the images of the cathedrals on pages 37, 39, and 41.


4. Looking at these images, what questions do you have about the Church in

the Middle Ages?


» After reading a text, good readers ask questions to help themselves understand

the text. For example, after reading about churches in the Middle Ages I might ask

how exactly a detailed stained glass window was made.

  - Tell students they will reread chapter 5, “The Power of the Church.”

  - Have students turn to the table of contents, locate the chapter, and then turn
to the first page of the chapter.

  - Have one student read The Big Question at the beginning of the chapter. Ensure
students understand the meaning of The Big Question before reading the chapter.


    - What practices in the Middle Ages show the influence and power of
the Church?


**TEKS 4.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and make pertinent comments; **TEKS 4.6.B** Generate questions about text before, during, and after reading to deepen understanding and gain information; **TEKS 4.7.G** Discuss
specific ideas in the text that are important to the meaning.


Lesson 8 Positive Aspects of Life in the Middle Ages
**179**


~~**RE-READING: CHAPTER 5 (20 MIN.)**~~


                  - Read the title of “The Power of the Church” aloud as a class. As you
read portions of the chapter, pause to explain or clarify the text at each
point indicated.


Unit 4
**180**


  - Have students silently read the last paragraph on page 38 to the top of
page 39.


  - Ask students what questions they might ask while they are reading this
section of the text. What do they want to learn more about?


Lesson 8 Positive Aspects of Life in the Middle Ages
**181**


**Inferential.** What does the word _orthodox_ mean?


» correct


Why do you think the eastern part of the Church chose this word as part of
its name?


» The Orthodox Church thought its beliefs were correct.


Unit 4
**182**


 - Point out that, like the word _church_, the word _orthodox_ is shown in this text
with both a lowercase letter and with a capital letter. Explain that when it is
written with a lowercase letter, it is an adjective, and when it is written with a
capital letter, it is a proper noun referring to a specific church.


**Inferential.** What does the word _catholic_ mean?


» “universal”, which means “applying to or including everyone”


Why do you think the western part of the Church chose this word as part of
its name?


» The Catholic Church thought its beliefs applied to everyone.


Lesson 8 Positive Aspects of Life in the Middle Ages
**183**


                 - Have students read the first paragraph on page 40 silently.


**Inferential.** What does the word _pilgrimage_ mean?


» “a religious journey”


What clues from the text help you to determine the meaning of the
word _pilgrimage_ ?


» “journey”; “visit one of these shrines”; “journey to fulfill a vow to God”


**Inferential.** Why would most Christians hope to go on at least one pilgrimage in
their lifetimes?


» Answers may vary, but should include the fact that the Church was an important

part of the lives of Christians in the Middle Ages.


Unit 4
**184**


Lesson 8 Positive Aspects of Life in the Middle Ages
**185**


**Inferential.** What role did monks and nuns play during the Middle Ages in
preserving writings from ancient Greece and Rome?


» Monks and nuns copied these writings by hand into new books.


Why might it be important to preserve this ancient knowledge?


» Answers may vary, but should include the fact that much of what historians know

about these ancient civilizations comes from their writings, and that the monks

helped save this information.


Unit 4
**186**


**Inferential.** Why did monks and nuns spend so much time carefully writing and
illustrating prayer books such as the Books of Hours by hand?


» Answers may vary, but should mention that this was the only way to get books

before the invention of the printing press and that the Church and prayer were

important to people in the Middle Ages.


Lesson 8 Positive Aspects of Life in the Middle Ages
**187**


                - Read the heading “If You Were a Monk” and the first paragraph on
page 43 aloud.


**Inferential.** Whom is the author talking to in this sentence? “Therefore, if you are
not destined to become a craftsman or a merchant, then becoming a monk is a
good option.”


» the reader


Unit 4
**188**


**Inferential.** This is written in the second-person point of view, meaning that the
author directly addresses the audience. Why would the author of this text use the
third-person point of view throughout most of the text, and then change to the
second-person point of view in some parts, such as the text on pages 43 and 44?


» Answers may vary, but should include that the author wanted to help the reader

imagine what life was like during the Middle Ages. By using the pronoun _you_, the

author brings the reader into the story and allows him/her to visualize life as

a monk.


 - Read the second paragraph on page 43 aloud.


**Inferential.** The word _however_ signals a change from the previous sentence or
paragraph. What is the change that occurs from the first sentence?


» The first sentence states something negative about life in a monastery, but the

second sentence states something positive.


**Inferential.** What words, phrases, or images provide clues to the meaning of
_humble_ in this paragraph?


» Possible clues include: “dedicate your life to God”; vow not to marry”; “obedient

life”; plain clothing in the images.


What does the word _humble_ mean? (a) proud, (b) not thinking you are better than
everyone else, (c) holy, or (d) not concerned with how difficult life could be in the
Middle Ages?


» (b) not thinking you are better than everyone else


Lesson 8 Positive Aspects of Life in the Middle Ages
**189**


                - Read the first paragraph on page 44 aloud.


**Inferential.** What does the word _however_ signal here?


» There is a change that takes place between the first and second sentence.

Although the first sentence says monks spend a large part of their day in prayer,

the _however_ used at the beginning of the second sentence shows there is a

change: monks did not spend their entire day in prayer. They also did other work.


**Literal.** What were some of the jobs monks did in the monastery?


» They washed clothes; cooked; tended to the garden; made honey; made shoes or

furniture; performed Gregorian chants; and copied works of classical writers or

produced new books.


Unit 4
**190**


**Inferential.** What words or phrases provide clues to the meaning of _sacred_ in this
paragraph?


» Possible clues include: “music, or musical speech, based on hymns or passages

from both the Hebrew and Christian Bibles.”; “monks perform these chants on

holy days.”


What does the word _sacred_ mean: (a) proud (b) not thinking you are better than
everyone else (c) holy or (d) not concerned with how difficult life could be in the
Middle Ages?


» (c) holy


**Literal.** [Have students look at the image on the bottom of page 44.] What
information is contained in this image? How do you know?


» It is the schedule monks followed each day for their prayers. The title of the chart

is “A Monk’s Daily Prayer Schedule.”


 - Have a student read the times of prayer aloud.


**Evaluative.** Do you think the monks’ daily prayer schedule would have been easy or
difficult to follow? Why?


» Answers may vary, but students may say it was difficult because the prayer times

spanned both day and night, leaving little room for rest or the other activities in

which monks participated.

**Note:** This Wrap-Up relates to The Big Question of the chapter.


                 - Ask students to summarize the practices in the Middle Ages that show the
influence and power of the Church.


» Answers may vary, but should include support from the text.


Check for Understanding:


Have students discuss their responses to this prompt in small groups.
Require that they cite textual evidence. The teacher should circulate and
check in with each group to ensure that they were able to come up with at
least two accurate examples.


                 - Ask students to summarize what it was like to be a monk during the Middle
Ages. You may wish to call on different students to summarize different parts
of the text.


» Answers may vary, but should include the following information:


                         - Being a monk had positive aspects, but it could also be a difficult way of life.
Although the process of becoming a monk was long and life in a monastery was
hard, monks were assured of a place to sleep, clothing, food, and medical care.


                        - Monks vowed to devote their lives to God, did not marry, and lived a humble and
obedient life.


                       - Although monks spent most of their time in prayer, there were many jobs they
performed, both on the land and in the monastery.


                 - Have students take home Activity Page 8.2 to read aloud to a family member.
Explain that they are rereading this portion of the text for fluency, so they
should read through it at least once from beginning to end without stopping.


~~**WORD WORK: DESTINED (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the chapter, you read that “Therefore, if you are not destined to become a
craftsman or a merchant, then becoming a monk is a good option.”


2. Say the word _destined_ with me.


3. _Destined_ means certain to become something or do something.


4. Antonella is such a good artist that she is destined to become famous.


Unit 4
**194**


5. Describe someone who was destined to become something or to do
something in his or her life.


  - Ask two or three students to use the target word in an oral sentence.
If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to use the target
word in complete sentences: “___ was destined to become ___.”


6. What part of speech is the word _destined_ ?


» adjective

  - Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up: “I will read to you several
sentences about a person becoming or doing something in his or her life. If
that person was destined, or certain, to become or do that thing, say ‘S/he
was destined to become/do ___.’ If it was not certain that s/he would become
or do something, say, ‘S/he was not destined to become/do ___.’”


1. Mozart, who began playing and writing music from a very young age, and

spent many hours practicing, became a world-famous musician.


» Mozart was destined to become a musician.


2. Mia, who is very smart and works very hard in school, wants to get good

grades.

activity page is an effective way to organize one’s thoughts when trying to
convince a reader to believe one’s opinion. Students will list at least two pros
(positive reasons) to be a lord, serf, knight, craftsman, monk, or nun. This will
help students select the topic for their draft opinion paragraph.


 - Students may have different opinions regarding whether certain aspects of life
are positive. Students should consider what they have learned about feudalism
and power relationships in the Middle Ages when listing positives of people’s
lives.


 - Explain that the “+” sign at the top of the chart is to remind students that
they are to list positive reasons to be a lord, serf, knight, craftsman, monk, or
nun during the Middle Ages.

Activity Page 8.1 for homework. Tell students they should also think about
who they would want to be if they were alive during the Middle Ages: a serf,
knight, craftsman, monk, or nun. Tell students they will not be able to choose
lord, as you have been modeling writing about lords throughout this unit and
will continue to do so. For Lesson 10, they will need to make a decision based
on the pros on Activity Page 8.1.

~~**WHOLE GROUP READING: CHAPTER 6 (20 MIN.)**~~


                 - Have students silently read page 47 and continue to the end of the paragraph
on the top of page 48.


Unit 4
**206**


**Inferential.** Have one student read the last sentence at the end of the first
paragraph aloud: “What happened next changed the course of English history.” Why
might the author have chosen to end this paragraph with a sentence like this?


» Answers may vary, but could include that this sentence captures the reader’s

attention and lets the reader know that this was a very important event.


Lesson 9 The Battle That Changed History
**207**


                 - Point out the map on page 48, which shows how far the English soldiers
marched. The caption beneath this map indicates they marched about
200 miles. Select a landmark or location familiar to students that is
approximately 200 miles away, and discuss whether they think they could
walk to that location.


                  - Have students read the rest of page 48 silently.


**Evaluative.** Compare and contrast the two armies.


» The Normans came from France and the English soldiers came from England.


» The Normans had 10,000 men and the English had 7,000.


» The Normans had skilled archers, thousands of foot soldiers, and knights on

horseback; the English had mostly foot soldiers armed with simple weapons, such

as bows and arrows, axes, spears, swords, and daggers.


**Inferential.** What else do we know about the English army?


» The English line was strong, but they were tired. They were determined. The

English soldiers created a shield wall with a line of soldiers all holding up

their shields.


**Inferential.** What does the word _determination_ mean?


» a quality that makes someone keep trying to do something, even if it is difficult


What words or phrases in the text provide clues to the meaning of the word
_determination_ ?


» “Nevertheless, the English line was strong”; “They stood with their shields raised”;

“They made it almost impossible.”


Unit 4
**208**


- Have students read page 49 silently.








 - On this page you read the word _drew_ . The word _drew_ has several different
meanings. You know the word means “to have made a picture.” _Drew_ also
means “to get something out of a safe place.” Here the Norman attacks and
retreats got the English out of their positions on Senlac Hill.


**Inferential.** What happened that made it possible for William and the Norman
soldiers to take over the English?


» The Normans attacked the English shield wall and then retreated several times.

When the English soldiers saw the Normans retreating, they pursued them,

creating a break in the wall. This made it possible for the Normans to penetrate

the English front and ultimately win.

What does the word
_mass_ mean?


» “widespread or affecting
many people”




- Have students read page 50 silently.


**Inferential.** After defeating the English army, what did William and the Normans
have to do before William could pronounce himself king?


» They had to march to the capital city of London.


**Inferential.** What claim does the author make about the cause of the Battle of
Hastings?


» The author claims that there was a disagreement about who was the proper king

of England and, because only one person could be king, they fought to determine

who would become king.



Unit 4
**210**


Which of the following lines of text provides the best evidence to support the
author’s claim:
(a) “On Christmas Day in Westminster Abbey, in the year 1066, the Norman duke
was crowned King William I of England.”
(b) “What happened next changed the course of English history.”
(c) “They forced the Norman knights to retreat.”
(d) “It took place because Harold and William each believed he was the true king of
England.”

**211**


                 - Have students read page 51 silently.


**Inferential.** What is recorded in the Domesday Book and why did William want
this information?


» It is a record of the property people owned throughout England. William wanted

the information to figure how much he could collect in taxes.


                 - Explain that the word _doomsday_ (spelled “Domesday” here) is a reference
to a part of the Christian Bible that states that on the last day of the world,
a complete list of people and their actions will be created. William’s list was
a complete list of people and property, so it was being compared to the list
referred to in the Christian Bible.


Unit 4
**212**


**Inferential.** How could the information in the Domesday Book be useful to
historians today?


» It provides information about the different counties, or areas, of England, and it

provides information about the property people owned at the time.

~~**LESSON WRAP-UP (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Use the following questions to discuss the chapter:


1. **Inferential.** Describe the tactics the Norman and English armies used

during this battle.


» The Norman army was larger and had better weapons, but the English army

had taken a position at the top of the hill, giving them an advantage. At first, the

Norman army tried to charge up the hill, but they were forced to retreat. The

Normans tried several times to attack and retreat. The English tactic was to

pursue the Normans during one of the retreats, which drew the English out of

their positions. When the English were drawn out of their positions, the Norman

army surrounded them on horseback and overwhelmed them.


**Note:** Question 2 relates to The Big Question of the chapter.


2. **Evaluative.** Think-Pair-Share. The title of the chapter is “1066: The Battle

That Changed History.” Do you think this is a good chapter title? Why or why

not? Support your answer with evidence from the text.


» Answers may vary, but should include evidence from the text about why the battle

did or did not change history.


Check for Understanding


Have students complete the “Share” portion of this Think-Pair-Share
activity as a small group so that the teacher can circulate and make sure
that students are using evidence from the text to support their answer.


 - Have students share the information discussed with their partner in the
Think-Pair-Share activity.


 - Have students take home Activity Page 9.5 to read and complete
for homework.


 - When writing responses, have students edit to capitalize languages,
use apostrophes for possessives, as well as edit for spelling using their
knowledge of spelling patterns and rules. Encourage them to return to
the Reader or use a reference source to ensure correct capitalization and
spelling.

guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to make complete sentences: “I
used determination to finish or accomplish ___,” or “___ used determination
to finish or accomplish ___.”


6. What part of speech is the word _determination_ ?


» noun


                  - Use a Word Parts activity for follow-up.

45 M
##### Language


~~**GRAMMAR (15 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students will distinguish the need for an adjective or an adverb to

modify another part of speech in a given sentence. ~~**[ TEKS 4.11.D.iv; TEKS 4.11.D.v ]**~~


  - Remind students that adjectives describe nouns and adverbs describe verbs.
Adding _—ly_ to adjectives changes them to adverbs, which are words that
describe how a verb is done.


  - Display the first two sentences you prepared in advance.


  - Have students read the first sentence. ( _The busy intersection meant_
_pedestrians had to be careful crossing._ ) Have them identify the nounadjective pair ( _intersection—busy_ ) and ask them what _busy_ describes. (the
intersection) Mark the noun and adjective with their respective abbreviations
(“n.” and “adj.”) and draw an arrow from _busy_ to _intersection_ .


  - Have students read the second sentence. ( _The children cleaned the room for_
_the party busily._ ) Have them identify the verb-adverb pair ( _cleaned—busily_ )
and ask them what _busily_ describes. (how the children cleaned) Note that
the adverb precedes the verb. Mark the verb and adverb with their respective
abbreviations (“v.” and “adv.”). Point out that the _y_ at the end of _busy_
changed to _i_ before the suffix _—ly_ was added.


  - Explain that it would be incorrect to say, “The children cleaned the room for
the party busy” because the word that is being described, _cleaned_, is a verb.


  - Returning to the first sentence, explain that likewise, it would be incorrect to
say, “the busily intersection” because the word being described, _intersection_,
is a noun.


  - Use the same procedure for the remaining sentences you prepared in
advance. It is important to note that the adverb may not be in the same place
in every sentence. Point this out when discussing the other sentences.


    - The brave captain sailed to a far-off land.


    - She volunteered bravely to go first.


**TEKS 4.11.D** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including (iv) adjectives, including their comparative and
superlative forms; (v) adverbs that convey frequency and adverbs that convey degree.

                  - It may be helpful to refer back to the Pronunciation/Syllabication Chart.

|---|---|---|
|acquire|/ə*quier/|ə*digraph|
|establish|/es*tab*lish/|closed*closed*closed|
|loyalty|/loy*ul*tee/|digraph*open*digraph|

|transform|/tranz*form/|closed *r-controlled|
|unravel|/un*rav*əl/|closed*closed*ə|



                 - Students might make the following errors:


                        - thrive: using ‘i’ for /ie/


                        - surrender: using ‘r’ for /r/


                        - acquire: using ‘u’ for /ə/; using ‘kw’ for /qu/

                        - seize: using ‘ee’ for /ee/ (The ‘ei’ spelling is rare.)


                        - retreat: using ‘ee’ for /ee/


                        - loyalty, promote, unravel: using ‘u’ or another spelling for /ə/

                 - Although any of the above student-error scenarios may occur, misspellings
may be due to many other factors. You may find it helpful to use the analysis
chart to record any student errors. For example:


                        - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


                        - Is the student consistently making errors at the ends of the words?


                        - Is the student consistently making errors in multisyllabic words, but not
single-syllable words?

have pursued ___.”


6. What part of speech is the word _pursue_ ?


» verb


                 - Use a Synonyms activity for follow-up. What are some words that are
synonyms of, or words with the same meaning as, _pursue_ ?


                        - Prompt students to provide words like _follow, chase, track,_ or _shadow_ . As
students discuss synonyms, guide them to use complete sentences with
the word _pursue_ and any synonyms they select.


**Lesson 10: Opinion Paragraph**
##### Writing 30 M


**Primary Focus:** Students will plan an opinion paragraph by stating their opinion

and supporting it with facts from the text. ~~**TEKS 4.11.A; TEKS 4.12.C**~~


**Note:** Tell students that you will discuss Step 5, including transition words.


**TEKS 4.11.A** Plan a first draft by selecting a genre for a particular topic, purpose, and audience using a range of strategies
such as brainstorming, freewriting, and mapping; **TEKS 4.12.C** Compose argumentative texts, including opinion essays, using
genre characteristics and craft.


Unit 4
**236**


  - Remind students of the informative paragraphs they wrote previously.
Display the Structure of an Opinion Paragraph Poster. Explain the structure
of an opinion paragraph: In the same way that the topic sentence of an
informative paragraph tells the reader what the writer will describe, the topic
sentence of an opinion paragraph states the opinion the writer will support in
the rest of the paragraph. Instead of detail sentences, an opinion paragraph
has at least two reasons supporting the opinion, backed by text evidence that
is often introduced with the word _because_ . The concluding sentence of an
opinion paragraph should include a “zinger”—one final attempt to convince
the reader that the writer’s opinion is the way to think.


  - Briefly review the difference between fact and opinion. (A fact is something
that is true and can be proven. An example of a fact is, “On hot summer
days, the temperature outside is high.” This is a fact because it is true and
can be proven by looking at the thermometer. An opinion is a personal view
or belief, or what you think about something. An example of an opinion
would be, “I think hot summer days are the best!” Not everyone thinks that
hot summer days are the best; some people do not like them. Thus, it is an
opinion, not a fact.)


Check for Understanding


Read the following statements and ask students to hold up one finger if
the statement is a fact, and two fingers if it is an opinion.

        - The Middle Ages was the best period in world history (opinion:
two fingers).


        - The leader of an empire is called an emperor (fact: one finger).


        - Disease was prevalent in towns during the Middle Ages (fact: one
finger).


  - Explain that in an opinion paragraph, the writer states an opinion and gives
the reader reasons for that opinion. When a writer states an opinion, he or
she is taking a stand and saying what he or she believes about a topic. The
writer is prepared to explain why he or she is taking that particular stand.
When a writer explains the reasons for his or her opinion, the writer often
uses the word _because_ to link an opinion with the reason for that opinion.


**TEKS 4.12.C** Compose argumentative texts, including opinion essays, using genre characteristics and craft.



Challenge


Ask students to state a
fact they have learned
about the Middle Ages,
then have them state an
opinion about life in the
Middle Ages.



Lesson 10 Opinion Paragraph
**237**


    - Explain that the first step to writing an opinion paragraph is to state your
opinion. Write a sentence starter for stating an opinion about being a person
in the Middle Ages such as:


      - If I could choose to be someone who lived during the Middle Ages, I would
choose to be a (serf/lord/knight/craftsman/monk/nun).


      - Ask students what they notice about what has been capitalized in this
sentence stem. (Beginning of the sentence, Middle Ages)


      - Remind students that historical periods such as the Middle Ages is always
capitalized.


    - Tell students you will write an opinion paragraph about being a lord using the
notes you took on the Pro Chart (Activity Page 8.1) to help you.


**Excerpt from Activity Page 8.1**

|Col1|+|
|---|---|
|Lord|1. Lords lived in castles or manor houses.<br>2. Lords controlled the land and towns near<br>their castles.|



   - Display the enlarged Planning an Opinion Paragraph Chart and Pro Chart.


    - Explain that the sentence starter at the top of the Planning an Opinion
Paragraph Chart has been completed using the word _lord_ .

~~**PRACTICE STATING AN OPINION (10 MIN.)**~~



~~**TEKS 4.12.C**~~




  - Remind students that for homework they were supposed to complete
Activity Page 8.1 and choose which social class they would write about today.
However, students could not choose “lord,” as that was the teacher model.


  - Have students circle their choice to complete the sentence starter at the top
of Activity Page 10.3.


  - Have students examine the rest of Activity Page 10.3. It contains a graphic
organizer that asks for three reasons that support the opinion stated in the
sentence starter at the top of the page. For each reason, students must list
evidence from the text and the page number where they found the evidence.
Students should then write the reason in a complete sentence in their own
words. They will include a transition word or phrase at the beginning, if
possible, and use the word _because_ to introduce the evidence for the reason.
Students can use Activity Page 8.1 to help them get started.


  - Have students begin to reread the text to locate information for the chart on
Activity Page 10.3.


  - Tell students they will work on completing Activity Page 10.3 in the next
writing lesson.


~~**LESSON WRAP-UP (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Have each student orally share a reason for their choice with a partner.


  - Explain that during the next writing lesson, you will demonstrate how to
expand each positive advantage into a complete sentence using your
own words.


  - In partner pairs, have students edit their opinion paragraph for capitalizing
historical periods.

Lesson 11 King Henry II
**245**


~~**WHOLE GROUP READING: CHAPTER 7 (20 MIN.)**~~


                 - Have students read pages 57 and 58 silently.


**Inferential.** To whom is the author referring in the first line when he or she says,
“The great conqueror is dead”?


» King William I, who was known as William the Conqueror


**Inferential.** Based on the context in which it is used, what does _turmoil_ mean?


» unrest, confusion


Why might England have experienced a period of turmoil after the death of William?
Cite evidence from the text.


Unit 4
**246**


» William was a very powerful leader who controlled many things. When he died,

there wasn’t anyone else as powerful and able to rule the way he did. “Power
hungry nobles fought each other, and some even challenged the ruling kings.”


**Inferential.** Direct students to the image of Henry II at the bottom of the page
and have a student read the caption aloud. In this image, why might King Henry be
holding a model of the abbey church he founded?


» The Church was a very powerful and influential institution in the Middle Ages, and

King Henry was probably proud of founding that church.


 - Have students read the first paragraph silently.


**Inferential.** The author begins this chapter with a short sentence: “The great
conqueror is dead.” The author uses this short, powerful sentence to capture the
reader’s attention. It also helps to set the scene for the events that will be described
in this chapter. Why do you think the author does not name the conqueror in the
first two sentences of the paragraph?


» Answers may vary but could include the fact that, taken together, the information

in the first two sentences could only be about one person—William the Conqueror

(“the great conqueror”)—who had an “incredible victory at the Battle of Hastings.”

Students may also note that, by not revealing the name of the person until the

third sentence, the author is holding the reader’s attention.


**Inferential.** In this first paragraph, the author says that William ruled with an iron
fist. The author is using what is called an _idiom_ . An idiom is a phrase, the meaning of
which is different from the literal meaning. This phrase does not mean that William
the Conqueror had a fist—a hand—that was made of iron. What do you think this
phrase means?


» It means that he was a strict ruler who kept very tight control over people

and events.


 - Have students read the remainder of pages 57–58 silently.


Lesson 11 King Henry II
**247**


**Literal.** What was the name of the tax that King Henry imposed, or made the nobles
pay? How did this differ from the practice earlier in the Middle Ages?


» the shield tax; nobles and knights had been required to serve in the king’s

army themselves


**Inferential.** _Mercilessly_ means “done with cruelty or harshness.” What part of
speech is _mercilessly_ ? (Hint: You learned about this part of speech in a previous

tax on nobles”


Unit 4
**248**


 - Have students read page 59 silently.


**Inferential.** The author uses the phrase _law and order_ in the first sentence on
this page, as well as in the chapter title. From the context, what do you think this
sentence means?


» This sentence means that King Henry II focused his attention on changing the

laws of England to restore order, or peace.


Lesson 11 King Henry II
**249**


**Evaluative.** The text says that in the Middle Ages, there was a method of proving
someone was innocent called _trial by ordeal_ . Reread the second paragraph to see if
you can figure out what _trial by ordeal_ means.


» Trial by ordeal was having someone who was accused of a crime prove they were

innocent by picking up a piece of very hot metal, being tossed into a pond, or

fighting an opponent. If the accused survived the ordeal, they were innocent.


Do you think trial by ordeal was a good way to prove someone’s innocence? Why or
why not?


» Answers may vary, but may include the fact that the ordeals only had to do with

physical strength and endurance and not proof of the crime. As a result, stronger

people who were guilty might be found innocent and weaker people who were

innocent might be found guilty.


**Inferential.** What does it mean to hear a case?


» When a judge hears a case, he or she listens to all the evidence and then makes

a decision.

- Have students read page 61 silently.


**Evaluative.** What did King Henry say about Thomas Becket at a royal dinner, with
many nobles in attendance?


» King Henry said, “Will no one rid me of this troublesome priest?”


What are some different ways this question could be interpreted?


» It could be interpreted as a request that one of the nobles help him get rid

of Thomas Becket. It could also be interpreted to be simply a statement of

frustration that Thomas Becket was not cooperating and King Henry did not know

how to change this.





Unit 4
**252**


**Literal.** Four knights who attended King Henry’s royal dinner heard the statement
made by King Henry and decided to take action. What did they do?

» He was an important king in the history of England.


2. Why was he so important?


» King Henry accomplished many things during his reign, including instituting a

tax on nobles, reforming the judicial system, and trying to reduce the power of

the Church.


3. **Literal.** How did King Henry II reform the judicial, or court, system?


» He eliminated trial by ordeal, established circuit courts, and helped develop

common law, or the law of the land, based on decisions made by circuit

court judges.


4. **Literal.** What events led to the assassination of Thomas Becket?


» King Henry became frustrated with Thomas Becket for not agreeing with him to

reduce the power of the Church. At a royal dinner attended by many nobles, King

Henry said, “Will no one rid me of this troublesome priest?” After that, four knights

who had heard the king’s remarks killed Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral.


5. **Evaluative.** Do you think King Henry II was responsible for the killing of

Thomas Becket? Why or why not?


» Answers may vary. If students believe King Henry was responsible for the death of

Thomas Becket, they may cite the quote, “Will no one rid me of this troublesome

priest?” and that he never forgave himself for the death of his friend. If students

believe King Henry was not responsible for Thomas Becket’s death, they may cite

the fact that he never specifically called for the assassination.

**Lesson 11: King Henry II**
45 M
##### Writing


**Primary Focus:** Students will be able to paraphrase facts from the text that support

their opinions in their own words. ~~**[TEKS 4.11.A; TEKS 4.12.C ]**~~


~~**MODEL SUPPORTING AN OPINION (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Review the structure of an opinion paragraph. Remind students that, in an
opinion paragraph, the writer states an opinion and gives reasons for that
opinion. When a writer states an opinion, he or she is taking a stand (saying
what he or she believes) on a topic and is prepared to explain why he or she
is taking that particular stand.


  - The first step to writing an opinion paragraph is to state your opinion.
Students should have completed the sentence starter on the Planning an
Opinion Paragraph Chart on Activity Page 10.3 in a previous lesson: _If I could_
_choose to be a person who lived during the Middle Ages, I would choose to be_
_a_ ( _serf/knight/craftsman/monk/nun_ ).


  - Have students examine the rest of Activity Page 10.3. It contains a graphic
organizer that asks for three reasons to support the opinion stated in the
sentence starter. For each reason, they must list evidence from the text and
the page number on which the evidence was found. Students should then
write the reason in a complete sentence in their own words. They will later
include a transition at the beginning of each reason sentence, if possible, and
use the word _because_ to introduce evidence for the reason. Students can use
the Pro Chart on Activity Page 8.1 to help them get started.


  - Display the enlarged Planning an Opinion Paragraph Chart to use while
modeling for students.


  - Tell students that you will model how to support your opinion with reasons.
Remind students that you have been modeling with the “lord” social class
throughout this unit.


  - Reference the Pro Chart on Activity Page 8.1. Remind students that this table is
an effective way to organize one’s thoughts when trying to figure out a reason
that could convince a reader to believe one’s opinion. Read the two “pros”
listed for lords: that lords lived in castles and that lords controlled the land
and towns near their castles. Although Activity Page 8.1 had only two reasons,
students will need to develop a third reason on their own to complete Activity
Page 10.3.


**TEKS 4.11.A** Plan a first draft by selecting a genre for a particular topic, purpose, and audience using a range of strategies
such as brainstorming, freewriting, and mapping; **TEKS 4.12.C** Compose argumentative texts, including opinion essays, using
genre characteristics and craft.



Unit 4
**260**


- Use think-aloud modeling to demonstrate how to consider each reason and
the evidence that would be needed to support it. For example, you might
question each “pro” listed on Activity Page 8.1: “Why were lords able to live
in castles? One reason was that they had a lot of money and control over
people who could build them. Why did lords have more money than others?
Lords had more money because they taxed the serfs and townspeople. Why
could lords tax the serfs and townspeople? Lords had special relationships
with the king that gave them special privileges—they were at the top of the
hierarchy of social classes during the Middle Ages.”


- The first row on Activity Page 10.3 asks for “Text Evidence/Page(s).” In
order to complete this row properly, students will need to refer to previous
graphic organizers or the Reader to locate the page where they found the
text evidence. It may be helpful to list the chapter numbers on the board
for reference.


  - Serfs/Lords: Chapter 2: “To the Manor Born”


  - Knights: Chapter 3: “Gloomy Castles and Jousting Knights”


  - Craftsmen: Chapter 4: “Merchants, Markets, and Mud: Towns in the
Middle Ages”


  - Monks: Chapter 5: “The Power of the Church”


  - Nuns: Chapter 5: “The Power of the Church” and page 41

- Model how to reference the Lords and Serfs Graphic Organizer and use the
paraphrased notes and page numbers to find evidence in the text. On the
top of page 10, the text says, “The lord lived in his castle or manor house. He
owned all the land around his home and often the nearby towns and villages,
too. The lord also controlled the lives of most of the people who worked for
him.”


- Tell students that you will use this evidence from the text to draft a reason
sentence. A helpful sentence starter is, “I would choose to be a lord because
. . . ” Tell students they will have time to add transition words and more detail to
the reason sentences in the next writing lesson.


- Write your draft sentence on the enlarged version of Activity Page 10.3. For
example, you could write:


  - I would choose to be a lord because the lord was in control of the land and
people around him.

~~**ELPS 5.G**~~



Lesson 11 King Henry II
**261**


- Remind students that each reason should be compelling—it should dazzle
readers and make them pay more attention to your opinion. Based on the
paraphrased notes, a second reason could be:


  - I would choose to be a lord because the lord was in control of the land and
people around him. The lord taxed the serfs and townspeople and used
this money to build his castle, organize his army of knights, and protect
the land that belonged to him.


- Point out that you used the paraphrased notes from the Lords and Serfs
Graphic Organizer to inspire your second reason sentence. In order to
craft this sentence with detail, you must return to the text to find more
information and write that information in your own words.


- Tell students that they only have two “pros” on their Pro Charts on Activity
Page 8.1. It is up to them to use the Reader to find a third reason that might
convince someone that their opinion is worth believing.


- Review the enlarged Planning an Opinion Paragraph Chart. Tell students
they will use the two “pros” from Activity Page 8.1 to write two sentences on
Activity Page 10.3 that support why they would choose to be a certain person
from the Middle Ages. Remind students that they must determine Reason 3
on their own.

Unit 4
**262**


  - Demonstrate how to review Activity Page 2.6 (Lords and Serfs Graphic
Organizer) and Activity Page 8.1 (Pro Chart) to select a third reason why
someone should choose to be a lord during the Middle Ages. For example,
as a third reason, you could say that lords learned how to read and write,
became skilled swordsmen, and could learn a musical instrument. Their
privileged lifestyle allowed them to do things that serfs could not. This
information is from page 9 of the Reader. Model how to transform this
information into a sentence using your own words, writing in the Reason 3
column of the Planning an Opinion Paragraph Chart as you work.

“Lords Reign During the Middle Ages”


If I could choose to be someone who lived during the Middle Ages, I would
choose to be a lord. First of all, I would choose to be a lord because the
lord was in control of the land and people around him. In addition, the
lord taxed the serfs and townspeople and used this money to build his
castle, organize his army of knights, and protect the land that belonged
to him. Lastly, lords also enjoyed privileges that other groups did not
during the Middle Ages, such as learning to read and write and playing
musical instruments. It would be best to be a lord during the Middle Ages
because lords were on top.

Unit 4
**280**


~~**LESSON WRAP-UP (10 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** Question 2 relates to The Big Question of the chapter.


 - Use the following questions to discuss the chapter:


1. **Inferential.** What does _wayward_ mean? Why did the author choose the

word _wayward_ to describe King John in the title?


» _Wayward_ means “behaving in an unacceptable way.”


» The author might have chosen _wayward_ to describe King John in the title because

King John took actions that both the Church and the nobles disagreed with. For

example, he objected to some of the Church’s decisions, he lost land to France,

and he taxed the people of England.


2. **Evaluative.** Why is Magna Carta considered to be one of the most

important documents in English history?


» It changed the balance of power in England by giving certain people rights, such

as having a say in creating laws; it provided a basis for some ideas that were

incorporated in the constitutions of modern democracies.


 - Have students share whether they were able to answer their “before reading”
questions as they studied this chapter.


 - Have students take home Activity Page 12.5 to read aloud to a family
member. Explain that they are rereading this portion of the text for fluency,
so they should read through it at least once from beginning to end without
stopping.

~~**WORD WORK: INEVITABLE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the chapter, you read, “A major conflict was inevitable.”


2. Say the word _inevitable_ with me.


3. _Inevitable_ means “will happen and can’t be stopped.”


4. When you are learning to do something new, making mistakes is inevitable.


5. Can you think of some inevitable consequences of not getting enough sleep?
Be sure to use the word _inevitable_ in your response.


 - Ask two or three students to use the target word in a sentence. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to make complete sentences: “If
someone does not get enough sleep, it is inevitable that ___.”


6. What part of speech is the word _inevitable_ ?


» adjective


 - Use a Sharing activity for follow-up.


 - Tell students that they will be working with a partner for this activity. One
student should describe to his or her partner a situation in which there
is a good chance something could go wrong. The partner will respond by
describing the inevitable consequences of that situation. For example,
one student might say, “Carrying too many heavy books at one time.“
The partner would say, “If I carry too many heavy books at one time, it is
inevitable that I will drop one or more.” Then have the students switch roles.

~~**MODEL DRAFTING THE PARAGRAPH (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students of the structure of an opinion paragraph. Tell students
that they can use the Structure of an Opinion Paragraph Chart on Activity
Page 12.2 as a checklist to make sure they have included all of the
components of an opinion paragraph.


  - Model how to incorporate all of the pieces of an opinion paragraph about
lords onto Activity Page 12.2 by first copying your topic sentence, which
states your opinion. Tell students that they can use the sentence starter at
the top of Activity Page 10.3.


  - Explain that there are a few more things to consider including in their opinion
paragraph. Transition words and phrases are helpful for making sentences
flow nicely in a paragraph. Explain that it is important to vary how each
sentence in a paragraph starts so the reader does not lose interest. Refer to
the transition words or phrases on the board/chart paper:


    - In addition,


    - First of all,


    - Second of all,


    - Lastly,


    - Finally,

  - Tell students that, after they draft their paragraph, they should consider
where to add transition words and phrases such as the ones you listed on the
board/chart paper.


  - Remind students to edit their paragraphs for capitalization of historical
periods and documents, as well as spelling regular plural nouns.


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.11.C** Revise drafts to improve sentence structure and
word choice by adding, deleting, combining, and rearranging ideas for coherence and clarity; **TEKS 4.11.D** Edit drafts using
standard English conventions, including (i) complete simple and compound sentences with subject-verb agreement and
avoidance of splices, run-ons, and fragments; (iii) singular, plural, common, and proper nouns; (iv)adjectives, including their
comparative and superlative forms; (v) adverbs that convey frequency and adverbs that convey degree; (x) punctuation
marks, including apostrophes in possessives, commas in compound sentences, and quotation marks in dialogue; (xi) correct
spelling of words with grade-appropriate orthographic patterns and rules and high-frequency words; **TEKS 4.12.C** Compose
argumentative texts, including opinion essays, using genre characteristics and craft.

Support


For students who need
extra support, you may
choose to work with a
small group of students
in order to guide them in
using their activity page
resources to draft their
opinion paragraph.




 - Then remind students that a concluding sentence retells the opinion
sentence in a different way. The concluding sentence is the writer’s last
chance to convince readers that they should have the same opinion as the
writer.


 - Tell students that they should also include a title for their paragraph. The
title can simply state what the paragraph is about, or it can be more creative.
Show students how to center the title and write it in quotation marks above
the paragraph. Examples of titles might be “Lords Reign during the Middle
Ages” or “Best to Be a Lord during the Middle Ages.”


 - Share the Draft Opinion Paragraph Example you prepared in advance, noting
that it has a topic sentence, reasons, transition words and phrases, and a
concluding sentence.


   - “Lords Reign during the Middle Ages”


   - If I lived during the Middle Ages, I would choose to be a lord. First of all, I
would choose to be a lord because the lord was in control of the land and
people around him. In addition, the lord taxed the serfs and townspeople
and used this money to build his castle, organize his army of knights, and
protect the land that belonged to him. Lastly, lords also enjoyed privileges
that other groups did not during the Middle Ages, such as learning to read
and write and playing musical instruments. It would be best to be a lord
during the Middle Ages because lords were on top.


~~**PRACTICE DRAFTING THE PARAGRAPH (30 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students work independently to use their notes to draft their opinion
paragraph on Activity Page 12.2. Suggest that they leave the first line on the
activity page blank so that, when they finish their paragraph, they can add a
title. Remind students to add transition words or phrases to the beginning
of one or two of their reason sentences. Remind students to complete the
assignment in cursive.


~~**LESSON WRAP-UP (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students share the transition words or phrases that they used in their
paragraphs with a partner.


 - Explain to students that they will have to take time to make revisions and
additional edits when they have finished drafting. Have students focus on the
skill of capitalizing languages, such as Middle English, and using apostrophes
in possessive nouns, such as Lord’s and Serf’s, as well as words correctly
using their knowledge of spelling patterns and rules.

**Note:** The Wrap-Up Activity relates to The Big Question for the chapter.


 - Use the following question to discuss the chapter:


**Inferential.** Reflect on what you learned about Joan of Arc. What made her such an
important figure in the Hundred Years’ War?


» Answers may vary, but should include information from the text. Responses may

include: she was female, which made her an unlikely soldier; she claimed to hear

voices that told her to fight the English; she had significant victories, such as the

one at Orleans; her contributions helped lead France to victory.


 - Tell students they have learned a lot about the Middle Ages and that they
will summarize what they have learned. They should think about why these
people, events, and ideas are important.


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 13.2 and examine the chart. Note that the
left column lists different things students learned about that were important
in the Middle Ages. The right column is blank and students will record the
impact of each event or development.

~~**ELPS 5.D**~~




  - Review the definition of _noun_ (both common and proper), _verb_ (both action
and linking), _adverb_, and _adjective_ using the Subjects and Predicates Poster.


  - Review the two parts of a sentence (subject and predicate). The subject,
which tells who or what the sentence is about, includes nouns (people,
places, things) or pronouns (words used to replace nouns, such as _he_, _she_, _it_,
etc.). The predicate tells what the subject is doing, did, or will do. Note that
a verb often begins the predicate. Subject and predicate are ways we can
group the parts of a sentence.


  - Refer to the Subjects and Predicates Poster. Read the poster with students.


  - Refer to the sentences you prepared in advance:


    - King John taxed nobles and wealthy merchants heavily.


    - The plague spread quickly through dirty towns and cities.

  - Ask students to find the subject of the first sentence. Remind students that
the subject answers the question _Who?_ Or _What?_ Next, have students search
the first sentence for a verb, or action word. Verbs are often at the beginning
of the predicate. Draw a vertical line between King John and taxed. Next write
abbreviations above adverbs and adjectives ( _adj._ for _adjectives_ and _adv._ for
_adverbs_ ).


  - Work through the second example. Students should direct you to draw a
vertical line between the subject and predicate and write abbreviations
above adverbs and adjectives ( _adj._ for _adjectives_ and _adv._ for _adverbs_ ).
Draw a squiggly line under each verb and underline nouns. Have students
identify which arrows you should add from adjectives to nouns and from
adverbs to verbs. Have students turn to Activity Page 13.3 and complete it
independently.

~~**MORPHOLOGY (15 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students will identify the meanings of words with the root arch and

use these words correctly in sentences. ~~**TEKS 4.3.C**~~


  - Tell students they will learn about a word part called a _root_, which is usually
from the Greek or Latin language.


  - Refer to the Roots Poster you displayed in the classroom and read it. Tell
students a root can appear at different places in a word.


  - Write the Greek root _arch_ on the Roots Poster and explain that it can be
pronounced /arch/ or /ark/, depending on the word and its context.


  - Explain that the root _arch_ means “ruler” and comes from the Greek word
_archos_ . Many words can be made from this root; sometimes it is pronounced
/arch/ and sometimes /ark/. Write the meaning of _arch_ on the Roots Poster.


  - Using the following chart, read each meaning of _arch_, noting the
pronunciation. In Grade 2, students were taught that the spelling _ch_ could
represent one of two sounds, /ch/ as in _church_ or /k/ as in _architect_ . Read
the example sentence, discussing how the word with the Greek root _arch_
functions within each word.


**Root Arch**














|Pronunciation|Example Words<br>from the Reader|Meaning<br>of arch|Example Sentence from<br>Text|
|---|---|---|---|
|arch<br>/arch/|archbishop|ruler; chief<br>or main;<br>most<br>important|To help him do this, he<br>appointed Thomas to the<br>position or archbishop of<br>Canterbury. This meant that<br>Thomas became the most<br>powerful Church leader in all of<br>England.|
|arch<br>/ark/|monarchy||By the time he died in 1189,<br>Henry II had done a lot<br>to restore the power and<br>authority of the English<br>monarchy.|



Tell students that words with the Greek root _arch_ are usually nouns.


  - Write _archbishop_ on the chart. Underline the Greek root _arch_ . In this word,
_arch_ means “chief or most important.” Briefly discuss the meaning of
the English root word _bishop_ (a leader in the Church) and then use it in
a sentence. ( _Archbishop_ means “the chief bishop, or the most important
bishop.” The archbishop was the most powerful bishop.)


**TEKS 4.3.C** Determine the meaning of and use words with affixes such as mis-, sub-, -ment, and -ity/ty and roots such as
auto, graph, meter.


Lesson 13 A Changing World

Activity Page 13.4


Activity Page 13.5




  - Read the first sentence with the word _archbishop_ from the chart:


    - To help him do this, he appointed Thomas to the position of archbishop
of Canterbury. This meant that Thomas had become the most powerful
Church leader in all of England.


  - Write the word _monarchy_ on the chart. Underline the Greek root _arch_ . Note
that _mon_ means “single or alone.” Discuss the meaning of _monarchy_ and
then use it in a sentence. (“government ruled by one ruler”; a king or queen is
usually the leader of a monarchy.)


  - Read the next sentence with the word _monarchy_ from the board/chart paper:


    - By the time he died in 1189, Henry II had done a lot to restore the power
and authority of the English monarchy.


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 13.4. Do the first item as a teacherguided activity, have students practice independently or in small groups as
needed.


~~**SPELLING (15 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students will practice spelling targeted words and use them in

sentences. ~~**TEKS 4.2.B.v**~~


  - Tell students they will practice writing the spelling words.


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 13.5, explaining that the spelling words
are listed in the box on the activity page and on the board/chart paper from
the first lesson.


  - Have students read sentence number one silently and fill in the blank. After
students complete number one, call on one student to read the sentence
aloud with the spelling word in the blank.


  - Ask students if anyone had a different answer. Discuss the correct answer to
ensure students understand why it is correct.


  - Have students check their spelling with the word bank at the top of the activity
page. They should make corrections if needed and then turn their page over.


  - Have students say, spell, and say the word again with you without looking at
their paper. Students may close their eyes, look up at the ceiling, or trace on
the back of their paper with their finger to help them visualize the spelling as
they spell with you.


  - Students should turn the page over and repeat the steps for the
remaining items.


**TEKS 4.2.B.v** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by spelling words using knowledge of prefixes.



Unit 4

##### Unit Assessment


~~**UNIT ASSESSMENT (90 MIN.)**~~


  - Make sure each student has a copy of Activity Page 14.1. You may have
collected this activity page from students at the beginning of the unit.


  - Tell students they will read two selections and answer questions about each.
In the next sections, they will answer grammar and morphology questions
evaluating the skills they have practiced in this unit.


  - Encourage students to do their best.


  - Once students have finished the assessment, encourage them to review their
papers quietly, rereading and checking their answers carefully.


  - Circulate around the room as students complete the assessment to ensure
everyone is working individually. Assist students as needed, but do not
provide them with answers.


**Reading Comprehension**


The reading comprehension section of the Unit Assessment contains
two selections and accompanying questions. The first selection is an
informational text that describes early types of castles in England and
France. The second selection is a literary text told from the point of view of a
boy serf.


These texts are considered worthy of students’ time to read and meet the
expectations for text complexity at Grade 4. The texts feature core content
and unit vocabulary from the _Middle Ages_ unit that students can draw on to
comprehend the text.

Lesson 14 End-of-Unit Assessment
**311**


**Optional Fluency Assessment**


                 - You may wish to assess students’ fluency in reading using the selection
“Kings and Queens.”


Administration Instructions


                 - Turn to the student copy of “Kings and Queens” that follows these directions.
This is the text students will read aloud. Turn to this copy each time you
administer this assessment.


                        - Call the student you will assess to come sit near you.


                        - Explain that you are going to ask him or her to read a selection aloud and
that you are going to take some notes as he or she reads. Also, explain that
he or she should not rush but rather read at his or her regular pace.


                        - Read the title of the selection aloud for the student, as the title is not part
of the assessment.


                        - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the selection. As the
student reads aloud, make a running record on the Recording Copy using
the following guidelines:

|Words Read Correctly|No mark is required.|
|---|---|
|**Omissions**|Draw a long dash above the word omitted.|
|**Insertions**|Write a caret (^) at the point where the insertion was<br>made. If you have time, write down the word that<br>was inserted.|
|**Words Read Incorrectly**|Write an “X” above the word.|
|**Substitutions**|Write the substitution above the word.|
|**Self-Corrected Errors**|Replace original error mark with an “SC.”|
|**Teacher-Supplied Words**|Write a “T” above the word (counts as an error).|



                 - When one minute has elapsed, draw a vertical line on the Recording Copy
to mark where the student was in the text at that point. Allow the student to
finish reading the selection aloud.


                 - Assess the student’s comprehension of the selection by asking him or her to
respond orally to the following questions:


1. **Literal.** What are two examples of royal things a king or queen might own?


» royal clothing or robes, a royal cup


Unit 4
**312**


2. **Literal.** Who was permitted to use royal things?


» the king and queen and other members of the royal family


3. **Inferential.** Name one benefit or advantage of being a king or queen.


» having the best of everything, best house, clothing, or food; being able to make the

rules or laws


4. **Inferential.** Name one difficulty or disadvantage of being a king or queen.


» People asked kings and queens for money, advice, or information; kings and

queens had big jobs and had to make important decisions.


  - Repeat this process with additional students as needed. Scoring can be
done later, provided you have kept running records and marked the last word
students read after one minute has elapsed.

The following is the text students will read for the Optional Fluency
Assessment, titled “Kings and Queens.” Turn to this copy of the selection
each time you administer this assessment.


You will also find a Recording Copy of the text for doing a running record of
oral reading for each student you assess. There is also a Fluency Scoring
Sheet. Make as many copies of the Recording Copy and the Fluency Scoring
Sheet as you need, having one for each student you assess.


Lesson 14 End-of-Unit Assessment
**317**


**Recording Copy**

**“Kings and Queens”**


Kings and queens were the most important and powerful people in their king- 10


doms. They had the best of everything. They had the best houses, the best clothing, 23


and the best food. Kings did not have to say “please” and “thank you.” They didn’t 37


even have to dress themselves. Pretty much everything kings and queens used, 48


touched, or owned was royal. The soft, fluffy robes a king wore were the royal 59


robes. The cup he drank from was called the royal cup. And if it was royal, that 73


meant that only someone in the royal family was allowed to use it. 88


A few hundred years ago, it might have been nice to be a king or queen ruling 100


your own kingdom. You would have made all the rules and laws that people had 115


to follow. However, being a king or a queen would have also been very difficult at 127


times. Kings and queens had big jobs to do. For example, every day, people came to 141


ask the kings and queens for money. People also came to ask the kings and queens 153


for advice, or information. Kings and queens had to make important decisions 167


about things that were happening in the kingdom. 180

Guidelines for Fluency Assessment Scoring


To calculate a student’s W.C.P.M. score, use the information you wrote
on the Recording Copy and follow these steps. You may wish to have a
calculator available.


1. Count _Words Read in One Minute_ . This is the total number of words the
student read or attempted to read in one minute. It includes words the
student read correctly as well as words the student read incorrectly. Write
the total in the box labeled “Words Read in One Minute.”


2. Count the _Uncorrected Mistakes in One Minute_ . You noted these on
the Recording Copy. They include words read incorrectly, omissions,
substitutions, and words you had to supply. Write the total in the box labeled
“Uncorrected Mistakes in One Minute” on the Fluency Scoring Sheet. (A
mistake that the student self-corrects is not counted as a mistake.)


3. Subtract _Uncorrected Mistakes in One Minute_ from _Words Read in One_
_Minute_ to get _Words Correct_ . Write the number in the box labeled “W.C.P.M.”
Although the analysis does not include any words the student read correctly
(or incorrectly) after one minute, you may use this information from your
Recording Copy for anecdotal purposes.


As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider.


It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.
scores. However, a major goal of Grade 4 is to read with sufficient fluency
to ensure comprehension and independent reading of school assignments
in this and subsequent grade levels. A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be
compared with the score of other students in the class (or grade level) and
also with the national fluency norms obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal
(2006). Hasbrouck and Tindal suggest that a score falling within 10 words
above or below the 50th percentile should be interpreted as within the
normal, expected, and appropriate range for a student at that grade level at
that time of year. For example, if you administered the assessment during
the fall of Grade 4, and a student scored 84 W.C.P.M., you should interpret
this as within the normal, expected, and appropriate range for that student.

~~**CONTENT ASSESSMENT**~~


Administer PP.1, the assessment of content knowledge acquired during the
first thirteen lessons of the unit as a pre-test before administering the unit
assessment. Ensure that each student has a copy of Activity Page PP.1. You
may have collected this activity page from students at the beginning of the
unit.


  - Allow students as much time as they need to complete the pre-test. In most
cases, this assessment will take approximately 30 to 45 minutes.


  - Tell students to read and answer the questions about what they have learned
about the Middle Ages. Encourage students to do their best and review their
work once they have finished.


  - Circulate around the room as students complete the assessment to ensure
that everyone is working individually.

~~**PAUSING POINT FOR DIFFERENTIATING INSTRUCTION**~~


  - Use the following Remediation and Enrichment suggestions, as well as PP.2PP.7, to plan activities for the remainder of the Pausing Point.


Remediation


For a detailed description of remediation strategies, which address lagging skills
in reading comprehension, fluency, language, and writing, refer to the Program
Guide.


Writing


  - Use time during the Pausing Point to return Activity Page 12.2, the opinion
paragraph that each student completed for homework several days ago,
along with the completed Opinion Paragraph Rubric and Editing Checklist to
all students. Meet briefly with individual students to discuss areas in which
improvement is needed.


  - You may wish to suggest that students needing more practice write a new
opinion paragraph, choosing a different category from Activity Page 8.1 than
the one they wrote about in Activity Page 12.2. Provide additional structure
and guidance for students, making copies of both the Opinion Paragraph
Rubric and Editing Checklist available (see the Teacher Resources), as well as
conducting over-the-shoulder conferences as students write.


Unit 4


Enrichment


Independent Reading of Self-Selected Texts ~~**TEKS 4.5.I; TEKS 4.6.A**~~


Pausing Points are a great opportunity to allow students to work independently
reading self-selected, choice texts for a sustained period of time. For teachers
who have not yet introduced self -selected independent reading into their
classroom, you may wish to reference the OER K-5 RLA Independent Reading
Guide in the program-level materials prior to implementing this lesson.


Teachers should ensure that available texts for self-selected reading are locally
approved and are suitable for the grade-level.


Before you read:


  - Teachers should utilize the Independent Reading Guide for students to selfselect texts about topics of interest in their study of the Middle Ages. Make
sure to use locally approved resources, and explain to students that they
should establish a purpose for reading their self-selected text. While utilizing
the Independent Reading Guide, circulate the classroom to assist students in
establishing a purpose for reading their self-selected text.


  - Be sure to have students establish a purpose for reading


  - Remind students of the classroom expectations. Some options you may wish
to consider are:


    - Explain that independent reading is an opportunity for them to freely, yet
wisely, select and read books that they find interesting.


    - Remind students that many people need a quiet environment when they
read, so students should plan on silent, independent reading time for the
designated amount of time of your choosing


    - (if applicable) Remind students to keep a log of the books they read.


    - Explain to students that as they read, you may conference with them 1:1
or have them quickly turn to a peer to share more about what they are
reading


While you read:


  - Teacher:


    - Circulate the room, monitoring for active reading


    - Confer with students 1:1 around what they are reading

  - Student:


    - Students should be engaged in silent independent reading for a sustained
period of time.


Pausing Point _The Middle Ages_
**325**


**326**




   - Students should be able to articulate their purpose for reading and share
with a peer or the teacher what they are reading about


After you read:


 - Gather students to debrief the independent reading session. Ask what went
well and what was a challenge.


 - Invite students to share a connection between the text and a personal
experience.


 - Challenge students to continue to read outside the classroom and to invite
their parents, familes siblings, and friends to participate in their reading
experiences.


Unit 4


~~**EMBEDDING THE EDITING PROCESS**~~


Revising and editing can be challenging for students. It may be helpful to follow

the steps below to help your students as they revise and edit their own work.


This process can be done at the sentence level, in addition to extended written

pieces. By using students’ quick writes and shorter responses, instructional

time can be maximized and the writing process will be authentic to what

students are composing.


**Steps for Successful Editing**


1. Model the editing process during writing instruction and target a single skill at

a time.


2. Select a text with errors to provide guided practice in small groups.


3. Partner or pair students for collaborative practice using pre-selected texts

with errors.


4. Provide opportunities for students to practice independently by editing their

own work or the work of a peer.


5. Conference with students in small groups or individually to provide corrective

and informative feedback.


6. Repeat the process by modeling a new grammar or convention skill.


**Last, but not least...**


 - Start with single sentences before moving onto longer pieces of writing.


 - Explicit grammar lessons can be reinforced using a variety of texts. Use

sentences from Read-Aloud or Student Reader texts to use as mentor

sentences.


 - Have students apply their understanding of a targeted skill in their short and

extended constructed responses.


 - Provide rehearsal opportunities during collaborative and independent writing

time.


 - Grammar is best taught in the context of student writing.


 - Incorporate spelling practice including use of high frequency words in written

compositions.

|TEKS|Description<br>of Skill|Sample Activity|
|---|---|---|
|4.11.D.i|complete, simple, and<br>compound sentences<br>with subject-verb<br>agreement and<br>avoidance of splices,<br>run-on, and fragments|Begin by focusing on simple sentences before moving onto<br>compound sentences. Take one skill at a time (i.e., subject-verb<br>agreement) and provide students with pre-selected text with those<br>errors. Once students are ready, move onto compound sentences.<br>Repeat the process with splices, run-ons, and fragments. Have<br>students engage in peer editing or independent editing. This can<br>also be achieved by using student-generated work.|
|4.11.D.ii|past tense of irregular<br>verbs|Model writing sentences in shared writing activities to<br>demonstrate the correct usage. Hold students accountable for this<br>skill in their own writing and have students routinely edit for the<br>past tense of irregular verbs in their own writing or that of a peer.|
|4.11.D.iii|singular, plural,<br>common, and proper<br>nouns|In cooperative groups of 3-4, students will use a draft they are<br>currently working on to edit for a specific noun type. Set a timer<br>and have students pass their paper clockwise to the person<br>next to them. First round, highlight the nouns (plural) in the<br>text. Second round, underline sentences that have errors in<br>the noun’s usage. Third round, suggest an edit for the correct<br>usage. Fourth round, student agrees/disagrees with the edit and<br>makes necessary changes.|
|4.11.D.iv|adjectives, including<br>their comparative and<br>superlative forms|Provide short passages with errors in the usage of comparative<br>or superlative adjectives. Have students rewrite the sentence<br>to correct errors. This can be done as an independent activity,<br>or warm-up to open the writing lesson. Have students share out<br>their corrected sentence with the class for comparison.|
|4.11.D.v|adverbs that convey<br>frequency and adverbs<br>that convey degree|Target common errors in adverb usage such as<br>• Incorrect placement of adverbs (e.g., “She quickly ran”<br>instead of “She ran quickly”).<br>• Overuse or misuse of adverbs (e.g., redundant adverbs like<br>“very quickly”).<br>• Missing adverbs where clarification or emphasis is needed.<br>Model the correct usage of adverbs during writing instruction<br>and encourage students to use adverbs in written responses.<br>Collect responses and use one of the student’s written pieces to<br>edit as a class.|
|4.11.D.vi|prepositions and<br>prepositional phrases|Common errors include:<br>• Incorrect preposition usage (e.g., “She is in the home”<br>instead of “She is at home”).<br>• Incorrect prepositional phrase placement or structure.<br>• Missing or unnecessary prepositions.<br>After teaching students about the function and use of<br>preposition and prepositional phrases, have them notice them<br>in the texts they are reading. As editing practice, have students<br>take turns reading their written piece aloud to a partner.<br>The partner will listen for the incorrect usage and, together,<br>students can edit the sentence to make it correct.|
|4.11.D.vii|pronouns, including<br>reflexive|Provide sentences with subject-object relationships or with<br>multiple instances of reflexive pronouns. Engage students in<br>a class discussion about the errors and how to correct them.<br>Provide students with opportunities to edit their own pieces for<br>the correct usage of reflexive pronouns.|


Unit 4



**328**


|4.11.D.viii|coordinating<br>conjunctions to form<br>compound subjects,<br>predicates, and<br>sentences|Provide students with stems that have different coordinating<br>conjunctions. For example, Cooking is rewarding because…<br>Cooking is rewarding, but…Cooking is rewarding, so… This is<br>a fun activity to tie to content students are currently learning<br>about because it can serve as a check for understanding for<br>comprehension. Students can edit their sentences after writing<br>them. Editing for coordinating conjunctions is appropriate to do<br>during revision when students are adding or rearranging their<br>details for clarity and coherence.|
|---|---|---|
|4.11.D.ix|capitalization of<br>historical periods,<br>events and documents;<br>titles of books; stories<br>and essays; and<br>languages, races, and<br>nationalities|Use lessons and activities provided in the product for<br>capitalizing historical periods, events, documents, titles, stories,<br>essays, and languages, races, and nationalities. Also, use pre<br>selected texts that target a specific capitalization skill and then<br>add this specificity to your editing checklist.<br>-|
|4.11.D.x|punctuation marks<br>including apostrophes<br>in possessives,<br>commas in compound<br>sentences, and<br>quotation marks in<br>dialogue|Refer to specific lessons that address punctuation marks and<br>ensure students have an opportunity to edit for apostrophes<br>in possessives, as this is a challenging skill, especially when<br>working with plurals. Dialogue is also a bit tricky, so providing<br>students with mentor sentences for punctuation is helpful.<br>As always, have students use writing that they are currently<br>working on to edit for this skill.|
|4.11.D.xi|correct spelling<br>of words with<br>grade appropriate<br>orthographic patterns<br>and rules and high-<br>frequency words|Incorporate editing for correct spelling using skills that are<br>presented in the spelling lessons for each unit. After a pattern<br>has been addressed, draw students’ attention to that pattern<br>and include that as a part of the “editing for spelling” in the<br>editing checklist. For example, if students are working with<br>multisyllabic words with final stable syllables (generation, etc.),<br>then the editing for spelling target can be that particular skill.<br>Continually bring students’ attention to the high frequency<br>words they encounter in texts.|
