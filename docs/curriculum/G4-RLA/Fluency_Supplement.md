**Introduction**

Research demonstrates that fluency practice produces gains in reading comprehension.
The program’s fluency instruction includes modeled reading, assisted reading (such as
choral or paired reading), independent reading, along with breadth of text encounters
and extended deep reading of selected texts. This multi-faceted approach ensures that
students receive low-stakes practice along with engaging, authentic fluency tasks, such
as performances.

This fluency packet was created to accompany the program’s Grade 4 and 5 materials.
It consists of poetry, folklore, and fables.These additional text selections provide
opportunities for students to practice reading with fluency and prosody (expression),
including phrasing and intonation.

The fluency routine outlined below provides a structured approach that equips
students to read passages accurately and with expression. As they gain accuracy and
confidence, they will naturally begin to read more quickly. However, it’s important not to
pressure students to race through the text or read with undue speed. In addition, it is not
a memorization drill—students should read the text as they perform even if they have
memorized the words. The goal is to read smoothly, accurately, and with prosody.

At the beginning of the week, you should make sufficient copies of the week’s selection
for each student. You should model reading the selection aloud to all students. When
time allows, have students spend time practicing reading the passages aloud each day and
encourage additional practice at home. During classroom practice, you should circulate
around the room and provide students with corrective feedback. The expectation for all
students should be that they are prepared to read the selection fluently and with prosody
by Friday.


**Note to Teacher**

Passage 23, “Protecting the Environment Part III” on pages 93-94 discusses power
outages. If this topic is sensitive for any of your students after the winter storm in February
of 2021, we recommend you skip that passage.

The five-day fluency performance routine below includes the following components:

**Day 1:** Introduce the text and read it aloud several times, modeling different tones or
inflections, phrasing, and expression, and encouraging students to reflect on each one.


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **1**


For example, if you read in a monotone, students should realize that this is not a stellar
reading; they may suggest better approaches, such as reading in a happy tone, an excited
tone, a nervous tone, or other tone appropriate to the selected text. Discuss with students
that text features, such as punctuation, and sentence structure can help them know when
to read text with phrasing, intonation, and expression (prosody). After modeling, invite
students to read aloud sample sentences from the text.

Students are encouraged to start reading the target text aloud at home. They may use
reading logs to record each session, if desired.

**Day 2:** Students practice reading the text chorally, with varying inflection or tone,
phrasing, intonation, expression, or other elements.

**Day 3:** Students practice both choral and paired readings, continuing to develop tone,
inflection, phrasing, intonation, and expression. Listen to students practice reading and
provide corrective feedback where necessary.

**Day 4:** Students continue practicing paired readings in preparation for the following
day’s performance. Circulate around the room and provide paired students with corrective
feedback where necessary.

**Day 5:** Student pairs perform their reading.

**Differentiation Options:** Students who are ready for a challenge may be prepared to
perform the text independently, while students who require additional support may read
the text chorally in groups rather than pairs.

If you choose to evaluate students’ performances, you may use the Fluency Passage
Performance Rubric to evaluate each performance.


**2** **Fluency Supplement** Grades 4 and 5


|Fluency Passage Performance Rubric|Col2|Col3|Col4|
|---|---|---|---|
||**Advanced**|**Proficient**|**Basic**|
|Accuracy|Reading contains no<br>errors in pronunciation.|Reading contains minimal<br>errors in pronunciation.|Reading contains<br>numerous errors in<br>pronunciation.|
|Rate|Reading is<br>conversationally paced<br>or paced to show<br>appropriate emphasis and<br>inflection.|Reading is uneven, with<br>interspersed periods of<br>speed and sluggishness.|Reading is labored and<br>slow.|
|Expression<br>(Prosody)<br>|Expression is strong<br>throughout the reading.<br>While the tone and<br>volume may vary, they<br>do so in keeping with the<br>student’s understanding<br>of the piece.|Reading generally sounds<br>like everyday speech,<br>with possible lapses into<br>expressionless speech.|Words are pronounced,<br>but they are not spoken<br>in a manner that indicates<br>an understanding of their<br>meaning.|



These selections may also be used to assess students’ performance in fluency and
expression (prosody). We recommend asking a student to read a passage aloud for a set
amount of time, such as one minute. During that time, the student will read from their
copy, while you use an additional copy of the text to mark any words the student misses
during the allotted time and to record student's use of expression (prosody), including
phrasing and intonation. At the conclusion of the allotted time, calculate the words read
correctly to get an estimate of the student’s fluency rate. Provide the student with feedback
and work together to set achievable goals to support each student in reading smoothly,
accurately, and with prosody. This activity may be repeated throughout the year with
different texts in order to measure student progress in fluency.


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **3**


**Dear Family Member,**

Throughout the school year, your student will be bringing home short text selections
on a weekly basis to practice reading. Your student should read the selection aloud each
night to help them become increasingly fluent and able to read without hesitation. You or
another family member may want to read the selection aloud first to model reading with
fluency and expression.

At the end of the week, your student may be called upon to practice reading the
selection aloud in class.

Repeated readings of text help build reading fluency, which includes automatic word
recognition, expression, accuracy, and speed. The goal of using these short text selections
is to help your student continue to strengthen their reading skills.

**1. “The Arrow and the Song”**

**by Henry W. Longfellow**


I shot an arrow into the air, 7

It fell to earth, I knew not where; 15

For, so swiftly it flew, the sight 22

Could not follow it in its flight. 29


I breathed a song into the air, 36

It fell to earth, I knew not where; 44

For who has sight so keen and strong 52

That it can follow the flight of song? 60


Long, long afterward, in an oak
66
I found the arrow, still unbroke;
72
And the song, from beginning to end,
79
I found again in the heart of a friend.

**2. “It Couldn’t Be Done”**

**by Edgar A. Guest**


Somebody said that it couldn’t be done, 7

But he with a chuckle replied 13

That “maybe it couldn’t,” but he would be one 22

Who wouldn’t say so till he’d tried. 29

So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin 40

On his face. If he worried he hid it. 49

He started to sing as he tackled the thing 58

That couldn’t be done, and he did it. 66


Somebody scoffed: “Oh, you’ll never do that; 73

At least no one ever has done it’; 81

But he took off his coat and he took off his hat, 93

And the first thing we knew he’d begun it. 102

With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin, 114

Without any doubting or quiddit, 119

He started to sing as he tackled the thing 128

That couldn’t be done, and he did it. 136


There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,
146

There are thousands to prophesy failure;
152

There are thousands to point out to you one by one,
163

The dangers that wait to assail you.
170


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **9**


But just buckle in with a bit of a grin, 180

Just take off your coat and go to it; 189

Just start to sing as you tackle the thing 198

That “cannot be done,” and you’ll do it. 206

_Assess each student’s comprehension of the selection by asking him or her to respond orally to_
_the following questions one on one with you:_


1. _**Inferential**_ Why did the first person state he had to try it before saying it
couldn’t be done?


» He thought it would be wrong to say that something couldn’t be done
until he tried it out to see whether or not it could actually be done. If he
tried it and he couldn’t do it, then he could truthfully say it couldn’t be
done because he would know from experience.


2. _**Literal**_ What did the second person do?


» something that someone said no one has ever done and he did it


3. _**Evaluative**_ What is the message of this poem?


» Don’t listen to people who warn you something can’t be done. Try it for
yourself. Once you get started and work to do it, you’ll find that it can
likely be done.

**3. “Rain in Summer”**

**by Henry W. Longfellow**


How beautiful is the rain! 5

After the dust and heat, 10

In the broad and fiery street, 16

In the narrow lane, 20

How beautiful is the rain! 25


How it clatters along the roofs, 31

Like the tramp of hoofs! 36

How it gushes and struggles out 42

From the throat of the overflowing spout! 49


Across the window pane
53

It pours and pours;
57

And swift and wide,
61

With a muddy tide,
65

Like a river down the gutter roars
72

The rain, the welcome rain!
77


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **13**


In the country, on every side, 83

Where far and wide, 87

Like a leopard’s tawny and spotted hide, 94

Stretches the plain, 97

To the dry grass and the drier grain 105

How welcome is the rain! 110

**4. “The Fir Tree”**

**by Hans Christian Andersen**

**(Adaptation)**


Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree. The sun shone on him, there was fresh 18

air, and around him grew many large-sized trees. But the little Fir wanted so very much to 35

be a grown-up tree. At the end of a year he had shot up a good deal, and after another year 56

he was another bit taller. 61


“I wish I was as big as the other trees,” he sighed. “Then I could spread out my 79

branches with the tops to look into the wide world! The birds would build nests among 95

my branches.” 97


Neither the sunbeams, nor the birds, nor the clouds which sailed above him, gave the 112

little Tree any pleasure. 116


In winter, when the snow lay on the ground, a rabbit would often come along and 132

jump right over the Tree. That made him so angry! But after two more winters, the Tree 149

was so large that the rabbit had to go round it. “To grow and grow, to get older and be tall,” 170

thought the Tree, “that is the most best thing in the world!” 182


In autumn the woodcutters always came and chopped down some of the largest trees. 196

This happened every year, and the young Fir Tree trembled at the sight. The magnificent 211

great trees fell to the earth with great noise and cracking. The branches were lopped off 227

and the trees looked long and bare. 234


In spring, when the swallows and the storks came, the Tree asked them, “Don’t you 249

know where the trees have been taken?” 256


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **17**


The swallows did not know anything about it, but the Stork nodded his head. “Yes, 271

I think I know. I met many ships as I was flying around. The ships had large masts, and I 291

think they that smelled of fir.” 297


“Oh, I would love to fly across the sea! What does the sea look like?” 312


“That would take a long time to explain,” said the Stork, and with these words off he 329

went. 330


“Rejoice in your growth!” said the Sunbeams. And the Wind kissed the Tree, and the 345

Dew wept tears over him. The Fir did not understand and was still unhappy. 359

_Assess each student’s comprehension of the selection by asking him or her to respond orally to_
_the following questions one on one with you:_


1. _**Literal**_ What did the Fir Tree want so very much?


» to be a grown-up tree


2. _**Inferential**_ Why did the Fir Tree tremble each autumn when he saw the
woodcutters chopping down some of the largest trees?


» He was afraid because he saw the great trees fall to the earth and their
branches chopped off, leaving them bare; he also didn’t know where the
trees were taken. He also knew one day he would be a large tree so he
might get chopped down as well.


3. _**Inferential**_ How did the Stork make the Fir Tree feel better about where the
trees went?


» The Stork said he had met many large ships as he was flying around. This
made the Fir Tree happy because he said he would love to fly across the
sea just as the stork does.

**5. “Grandfather Frog’s Big Mouth Gets Him in Trouble”**

**by Thornton W. Burgess**
**(Adaptation)**


Grandfather Frog has a great big mouth. He learned a long time ago that a big mouth 17

is handy for catching foolish green flies. But once in a while his big mouth gets him into 35

trouble. It holds so much that it makes him greedy sometimes. He stuffs it full after his 52

stomach already has all that it can hold, and then he can’t swallow. Then Grandfather Frog 68

looks very foolish and silly. 73


One morning Grandfather Frog had a very good breakfast of foolish green flies and 87

didn’t need another thing to eat. Little Joe Otter came along. He had been fishing and had 104

eaten all he could. Now he was taking the rest of his catch to a secret hiding place. 122


Now Grandfather Frog is very fond of fish, and when he saw those that Little Joe 138

Otter had, his eyes glistened, and in spite of his full stomach his mouth watered. 153


“Good morning, Grandfather Frog! Have you had your breakfast yet?” called Little 165

Joe Otter. 167


Grandfather Frog wanted to say no, but he always tells the truth. “Yes,” he replied. “I 183

have.” 184


“Ok. I thought that if you hadn’t, you might like a fish. But since you have already 201

eaten, of course you don’t want one,” said Little Joe, his eyes beginning to twinkle. He held 218

the fish out so Grandfather Frog could see just how plump and nice they were. 233


“Chugarum!” exclaimed Grandfather Frog. “Those certainly are very nice fish. It is 245

very nice of you to think of a poor old fellow like me. I might find room for just a little 266

teeny one, if you can spare it.” 273


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **21**


Little Joe Otter knows all about Grandfather Frog’s greediness. He looked at 285

Grandfather Frog and saw how he was already stuffed full. The twinkle in his eyes grew 301

more mischievous than ever as he said, “Of course I can. But I wouldn’t think of giving 318

such an old friend a teeny, weeny one.” 326


Little Joe picked out the biggest fish he had and tossed it over to Grandfather Frog. It 343

landed close by his nose with a great splash. It was almost half as big as Grandfather Frog 361

himself. It was plump and looked so tempting that Grandfather Frog forgot all about his 376

full stomach. He even forgot to be polite and thank Little Joe Otter. He just opened his 393

great mouth and grabbed the fish. The fish had started down Grandfather Frog’s throat 407

head first. 409


Grandfather Frog has no teeth, so he cannot bite things in two. He has to swallow 425

them whole. That is just what he started to do with the fish. It went all right until the 444

head reached his stomach. But you can’t put anything more into a thing already full, and 460

Grandfather Frog’s stomach was packed as full as it could be of foolish green flies. There 476

the fish stuck, and gulp and swallow as hard as he could, Grandfather Frog couldn’t make 492

that fish go a bit farther. Then he tried to get it out again, but it had gone so far down his 514

throat that he couldn’t get it back. Grandfather Frog had a fish stuck in his throat and he 532

couldn’t do anything about it. 537

**6. “Grandfather Frog Starts Out to See the Great World”**

**by Thornton W. Burgess**
**(Adaptation)**


Grandfather Frog looked very serious as he sat on his big green lily pad. A foolish 16

green fly actually brushed Grandfather Frog’s nose and he didn’t even notice it. Ever 30

since he had fought with his cousin, old Mr. Toad, about going out into the Great World, 47

Grandfather Frog had been thinking. 52


When Farmer Brown’s boy appeared, Grandfather Frog had hid under a lily pad. He 66

watched old Mr. Toad sit and grin, for he wasn’t afraid of Farmer Brown’s boy. In fact, he 84

had said that they were friends. When he saw Farmer Brown’s boy tickle old Mr. Toad 100

under his chin with a straw, he knew that it was true. 112


Grandfather Frog had not come out of his hiding place until after old Mr. Toad and 128

Farmer Brown’s boy had left. Then Grandfather Frog had climbed back on his big green 143

lily pad and had sat there thinking very hard. And now, on this bright morning, he was 160

still thinking. 162


The fact is Grandfather Frog was beginning to wonder if perhaps, after all, Mr. Toad 177

was right. If the Great World had taught him how to make friends with Farmer Brown’s 193

boy, there really must be some things worth learning there. Not for the world would 208

Grandfather Frog have admitted to old Mr. Toad or to any one else that there was anything 225

for him to learn. But right down in his heart he was beginning to think that there were 243

things he couldn’t learn in the Smiling Pool. So he sat and thought and thought. Suddenly 259

he made up his mind. 264


“Chugarum!” said he. “I’ll do it!” 270


“Do what?” asked Jerry Muskrat, who happened to be swimming past. 281


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **25**


“I’ll go out and see for myself what this Great World old Mr. Toad talks about is like,” 299

replied Grandfather Frog. 302


“Don’t you do it,” said Jerry Muskrat. “Don’t you do anything so foolish! You’re much 317

too old, Grandfather Frog, to go out into the Great World.” 328


Few old people like to be told that they are too old to do things. “You just mind your 347

own business!” he said sharply. “I know what is best for me. If my cousin, old Mr. Toad, 365

can take care of himself out in the Great World, I can. I’m going, and that is all there is 385

about it!” 387


With that Grandfather Frog dove into the Smiling Pool, swam across to a place where 402

the bank was low, and without once looking back started across the Green Meadows to see 418

_Look before you leap; the water may be deep._ 9


That is very good advice, but most people find that out when it is too late. 25

Grandfather Frog did. He had heard that verse all his life. But Grandfather Frog seemed to 41

have left all his wisdom behind him when he left the Smiling Pool to go out into the Great 60

World. Grandfather Frog had been getting into scrapes ever since he started out on his 75

foolish journey, and now here he was in still another. He had landed in it head first, with a 94

great splash. 96


When he had seen the cool, sparkling water of the spring, he couldn’t wait another 111

second to get into it. He was so hot and dry and thirsty and uncomfortable. Grandfather 127

Frog didn’t look at all before he leapt. He just dove in with a great long jump. That water 146

felt so good. For a few minutes he couldn’t think of anything else. Grandfather Frog just 162

closed his eyes and floated there in pure happiness. 171


He opened his eyes to look around. Then he blinked them rapidly for a minute or so. 188

He rubbed them to make sure that he saw things correctly. His heart seemed to sink way, 205

way down towards his toes. “Chugarum,” exclaimed Grandfather Frog, “Chugarum.” And 216

after that for a long time he didn’t say a word. 227


All around him rose perfectly straight smooth walls. He could look up and see a little 243

of the blue sky right overhead and whispering leaves of trees and bushes. Over the edge of 260

the smooth straight wall grasses were bending. But they were so far above his head. There 276

wasn’t any place to climb out. Grandfather Frog was in a prison. 288


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **29**


A long time ago, Farmer Brown had cleared away all the dirt around the spring. Then 304

he had knocked the bottom out of a nice clean barrel and had dug down where the water 322

bubbled up out of the sand. He set the barrel down in this hole and filled in the bottom 341

with clean white sand for the water to bubble up through. About half-way up the barrel 357

he had cut a little hole for the water to run out as fast as it bubbled in at the bottom. The 379

water never could fill the barrel because when it reached that hole, it ran out. This left a 397

straight, smooth wall up above, a wall altogether too high for Grandfather Frog to jump 412

over from the inside. 416


Poor old Grandfather Frog. He wished more than ever that he never thought of 430

leaving the Smiling Pool to see the Great World. Round and round he swam, but he 446

couldn’t see any way out of it. The little hole where the water ran out was too small for 465

him to squeeze through, as he found out by trying and trying. So far as he could see, he 484

just had to stay there all the rest of his life. Worse still, he knew that Farmer Brown’s boy 503

sometimes came to the spring for a drink, for he had seen him do it. That meant that the 522

very next time he came, he would find Grandfather Frog because there was no place to 538

hide. When Grandfather Frog thought of that, he just lost heart. Yes, Sir, he just lost heart. 555

He gave up all hope of ever seeing the Smiling Pool again, and two big tears ran out of his 575

big eyes. 577

**8. “The Dear Old Smiling Pool Once More”**

**by Thornton W. Burgess**
**(Adaptation)**


Black Cat was having a good time. But Grandfather Frog wasn’t. It was great fun for 16

Black Cat to slip a paw under Grandfather Frog and toss him up in the air but it was a 36

dreadful time for Grandfather Frog. He was terribly frightened. Black Cat didn’t always 49

cover up her claws, and they pricked right through Grandfather Frog’s white and yellow 63

skin and hurt. 66


At last Black Cat grew tired of playing, so catching up Grandfather Frog in her mouth, 82

she started along the path from the spring to Long Lane. 93


“It’s all over, and this is the end,” moaned Grandfather Frog. “I’m going to be eaten 109

now. Why did I ever leave the Smiling Pool?” 118


Just then, Grandfather Frog heard a familiar sound. It was the whistle of Farmer 132

Brown’s boy. A little bit of hope began to stir in the heart of Grandfather Frog. He had 150

been afraid of Farmer Brown’s boy, but now if the boy should take him, he might be able to 169

get away. He was very sure that he would never get away from Black Cat. The whistle drew 187

nearer. Black Cat stopped. 191


“Hi, Black Cat! Have you been hunting? Come show me!” cried a voice. 204


Farmer Brown’s boy stooped down to see what she had in her mouth. 217


“Why,” he exclaimed, “I do believe this is the very same frog that got away from me! 234
You don’t want him. I’ll just put him in my pocket and take him up to the house.” 252


With that he dropped Grandfather Frog in his pocket. He patted Black Cat and 266
started on his way, whistling merrily. It was dark and rather close in that pocket, but 282


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **33**


Grandfather Frog didn’t mind. It was a lot better than feeling sharp teeth and claws. After 298

a while, he felt himself swung through the air, and he landed on the ground with a thump. 316

Farmer Brown’s boy had taken off his coat and thrown it down. 328


The whistling stopped. Everything was quiet. Grandfather Frog waited and listened, 339

but not a sound could he hear. Then he saw a little ray of light creeping into his prison. He 359

squirmed and pushed, and all of a sudden he was out of the pocket. The bright light made 377

him blink. As soon as he could see, he looked to see where he was. Then he rubbed his 396

eyes with both hands and looked again. He wasn’t at Farmer Brown’s house at all. He was 413

right on the bank of the Smiling Pool, and a little way off was Farmer Brown’s boy fishing! 431


“Chugarum!” cried Grandfather Frog, and it was the loudest, gladdest chugarum that 443

the Smiling Pool ever had heard. “Chugarum!” he cried again, and with a great leap he 459

dove with a splash into the dear old Smiling Pool, which smiled more than ever. 474


And never again has Grandfather Frog tried to see the Great World. He is quite 489

content to leave it to those who like to dwell there. And since his own wonderful 505

adventures, he has been ready to believe anything he is told about what happens there. 520

**9. “I Wonder Part I”**

**by Kate Douglas Wiggin and Nora Archibald Smith**
**(Adaptation)**


Once upon a time there was a man who had three sons. Their names were Peter, Paul, 17

and they called the youngest brother Youngling. The man didn’t have one penny to rub 32

against another. He told his sons that they must go out into the world and try to earn their 51

bread. 52


Nearby the poor man’s cottage was the King’s palace. Against the windows of the 66

palace, a great oak tree had sprung up and it took away all the light. The King said he 85

would give treasure to the man who could chop down the oak tree, but no one could do it. 104

As soon as one branch of the oak’s trunk flew off, two grew in its place. 120


The King desired a well to hold water for the whole year. So the King said he would 138

give both money and goods to anyone who could dig him a well that could hold water for 156

a whole year, but no one could do it. The palace lay high, high up on a hill, and they could 177

only dig a few inches before they came upon rock. 187


The King was set on having these two things done. He had sent out the word far and 205

wide that whoever could cut the big oak in the King’s courtyard, and get him a well that 223

would hold water the whole year round, should have half the kingdom. 235


Well! You may easily know there were many men who came to try their luck. All their 252

hacking and digging did not work. The oak tree grew taller at every stroke of the axe, and 271

the rock grew no softer. 275


So one day the three brothers thought they’d set off and try, too. Their father didn’t 291

stop them. When the brothers said they thought of going to the palace, their father said 307

“Yes,” at once, and Peter, Paul, and Youngling went away from their home. 320


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **37**


They had not gone far before they came to woods with fir trees. Up along one side of 338

the woods rose a steep hillside, and as they went they heard something chopping away. 353


“I wonder what is making that chopping sound,” Youngling said. 363


Youngling decided to go see what was making the chopping sound. Peter and Paul 377

teased him for going. But Youngling didn’t care what they said. He climbed the steep 392

hillside toward where the noise came, and when he reached the place, what do you think 408

he saw? 410


Why, an axe that stood there chopping away, all by itself, at the trunk of a fir tree. 428

“Good day,” said Youngling to the axe. “So you stand here all alone and chop?” 15


The axe said he had been chopping and hacking and waiting for Youngling for a long 31

time. Youngling took the axe apart and placed it in his bag. He walked back down the hill 49

to his brothers. 52


When the brothers had gone a bit farther, they came under a steep wall of rock, and 69

up above they heard something digging and shoveling. 77


“I wonder,” said Youngling, “what it is digging and shoveling up at the top of the rock? 94
I think it would be a piece of fun just to see what it really is.” 110


And so off he set to climb the rock, while his brothers laughed and teased him. When 127
he got near the top, what do you think he saw? Why, a shovel that stood there digging 145
away. 146


“Good day,” said Youngling. “So you stand here all alone and shovel?” 158


The shovel said he had been shoveling and waiting for Youngling for a long time. 173
Youngling took the shovel, put it in his bag, and climbed down again to his brothers. 189


So they went on again a good bit until they came to a brook. They were all thirsty 207
after their long walk, and so they lay down beside the brook to have a drink. 223


“I wonder where this water comes from,” Youngling said. So up alongside the brook he 238
went, in spite of all that his brothers shouted after him. Nothing could stop him. On he went. 256


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **41**


And as he went up and up, the brook grew smaller and smaller, and at last, a little way farther [276]

on, what do you think he saw? Why, a great walnut, and out of that the water trickled. 294


“Good day,” said Youngling again. “So you lie here and trickle, and run down all 309

alone?” 310


The walnut said he had been trickling and waiting for Youngling. 321


Youngling took a lump of moss and plugged up the hole in the walnut so the water 338

wouldn’t run out. Then he put the Walnut into his wallet, and ran down to his brothers. 355


“Well, now,” said Peter and Paul, “have you found out where the water comes from? A 371

rare sight it must have been!” 377


“Oh, after all, it was only a hole it ran out of,” said Youngling, and the others laughed 395

and made fun of him again, but Youngling didn’t mind that a bit. 408

**11. “I Wonder Part III”**

**by Kate Douglas Wiggin and Nora Archibald Smith**
**(Adaptation)**


When the brothers had gone a little farther, they came to the King’s palace. So many 16

men had come to try their luck. The oak tree was now twice as wide and tall as it had been 37

at first since two branches grew for every one they chopped out with their axes. 52


The King had started to punish those who failed to cut down the oak tree. If a man 70

failed, he was put on an island. But the two brothers were quite sure they could chop down 88

the oak tree. Peter, as he was the oldest, was to try first. When Peter chopped into the tree, 107

two new branches grew where he cut with the axe. So the King’s men seized him and put 125

him out on the island. 130


Now Paul was to try his luck, but the same thing happened to him! When he had 147

swung the axe for two or three strokes, the oak tree began to grow. The King’s men seized 165

Paul and put him out on the island. 173


So now it was Youngling’s turn to try. He took his axe out of his bag and fitted it to its 194

handle. 195


“Chop away!” said he to his axe, and away it chopped, making the wood chips fly, so 212

that it wasn’t long before down came the oak. 221


When that was done, Youngling pulled out his shovel from his bag. 233


“Dig away!” said he to his spade, and so the spade began to dig until the earth and 251
rock flew out in splinters, and he soon had the well deep enough. 264


And when he had got it big and deep, Youngling took out his walnut and laid it in one 283
corner of the well, and pulled the plug of moss out. 294


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **45**


“Trickle and run,” said Youngling, and so the walnut trickled and ran until the water 309

gushed out of the hole in a stream, and in a short time the well was filled. 326


Since Youngling had chopped down the oak tree and dug a well in the palace yard, he 343

got half the kingdom. It was good that Peter and Paul were on an island so they didn’t have 362

to hear everyone say, “Well, Youngling wasn’t so much out of his mind when he took to 379

wondering about things after all!” 384

**12. “Thomas Jefferson”**


Our third president, Thomas Jefferson, was a wonderful writer. He wrote about 12

nearly everything, because nearly everything interested him. One time, Jefferson was 23

trying to write a very important paper about liberty. Like his friend George Washington, 37

Jefferson thought the king of England was not being fair to the colonists in America, so 53

it was time to start a new country. Not everyone in the colonies felt that way, though. 70

Jefferson, Washington, and their friends needed to give good, strong reasons to make this 84

big change. Leaders from all over America met to talk about what to say. They chose five 101

people to work on a document explaining the reasons for a new nation, including Thomas 116

Jefferson. 117


John Adams worked with Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson and Adams were great friends, 129

though Adams was as different as he could be from Jefferson. However, they were alike 144

in one thing: they agreed it was time to start a new nation. Since John Adams was older, 162

Jefferson suggested, “John, you should write the paper explaining our ideas.” 173


“No, Thomas,” Adams replied. “I have angered many people by arguing for a new 187

country and some of them do not like me. Everyone likes you, though, so they will be 204

more likely to help. Besides, you are a better writer than I am.” 217


Jefferson wanted to make this document the best thing he had ever written. He would 232

call it the “Declaration of Independence.” Jefferson’s declaration said that every person 244

should feel safe to live, to be free, and to decide what to do in order to be happy. Jefferson’s 264

declaration said that this was the reason to start a new nation: the United States of 280

America. His friend John Adams smiled and said, “I told you, Thomas; you were the man 296

to write it.” 299


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **49**


Two days after Jefferson finished the Declaration of Independence—on the Fourth of 312

July—the other leaders voted to officially begin our country, independent from England. 325

That is why we call the Fourth of July “Independence Day.” 336


After the new nation was born, Americans read Thomas Jefferson’s document again 348

and again whenever they were deciding how the country should work. People in other 362

countries said, “We want to be free, too,” and followed America’s example by making 376

changes in their countries. Jefferson’s words about liberty changed people’s lives all over 389

the world. 391

**13. “The Home of the President: Washington, D.C.”**


The American flag is the symbol of our nation, the United States of America. It has 16
red and white stripes and fifty stars. Each star is a symbol for one of the states in the 35
United States of America. There is one very important city in the United States that is 51
not in any of the fifty states. In fact, it is the nation’s capital. It’s the city where most of the 72
decisions that affect the country are made: Washington, D.C. 81


Men from each of the original colonies helped write the Constitution, a plan for how 96
the new country should be run. We call these men the “Founding Fathers.” The Founding 111
Fathers wanted a leader who would listen to what the people wanted and work hard to 127
get them what they needed. They decided the president would have to be elected by the 143
people. 144


When the Founding Fathers started to think about where the president would live, 157
they started to worry. If the president lived in the state he was from, it would make that 175
state feel more important than all the others. The Founding Fathers were afraid that one 190
of the states would try to take over and be in charge of the others. They decided to write 209
into the Constitution that a special city should be built, no bigger than ten miles wide, 225

which would serve as the nation’s capital. This capital city would not be in any state, so no 243

state could say that it was in charge of the country. This city was to be called Washington, 261

in honor of George Washington, our first president. Eventually, Washington grew into the 274

area we now call the District of Columbia, or Washington, D.C. 285


If you visit Washington, D.C., today, you can see the White House, the house where the 301

president lives. The president moves into this house when he or she becomes president, and 316

then moves out when the next president is elected. But not just presidents live in the White 333

House. Their families, and even their pets, come with them to live in the White House. 349


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **53**


The president doesn’t just live in the White House; he or she works there, too. 364

The part of the White House where the president works is called the West Wing. The 380

president’s office has a special name, too: the Oval Office. Sometimes the president signs 394

laws or gives speeches from the Oval Office. 402

**14. “The East African Savanna Habitat”**


A savanna is another name for grassland, a wide-open, vast stretch of grass-covered 13

land. There are not many trees or bushes. The East African Savanna has very warm 28

weather all year round. It only has two seasons: the very rainy summer, and the very dry 45

winter. The plants and animals that live here have adapted to these two very different 60

kinds of weather. 63


Grass is the most important plant in the savannas. The grasses can survive the tough 78

conditions of their habitat. The grass has adapted to these conditions by growing very 92

deep roots. Even if the grass above ground is destroyed, the roots underground survive 106

and the grass can grow back. This grass grows very quickly, as much as an inch per day! 124


Grass is food for many of the larger animals, like elephants, zebras, gazelles, and 138

antelope. They chew on grass all day long. Animals depend on the nutrients in the grass 154

to survive. It would seem that because so many animals eat the grass in the savanna every 171

day, there wouldn’t be very much grass left after a while. But, this grass grows back very 188

quickly, so there’s usually plenty for the different herbivores, like zebras and antelope, to 202

eat! Plus, different animals are adapted to eat different parts of the grass. 215


Many animals get their meals from the acacia tree. Giraffes, with their long necks 229

and tongues, eat twigs and leaves from the top of the acacia. Not only are giraffes’ tongues 246

long, they are also very tough. The twigs of the acacia tree are covered with sharp thorns 263

that the giraffes eat along with the twigs and leaves! Giraffes eat many of the insects that 280

live on the tree as well. 286


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **57**


Acacias have adapted well to their habitat. Acacias have small leaves that don’t dry out 301

as quickly as larger leaves would in the dry, hot months. The roots of an acacia grow very 319

deep into the ground, which allows them to collect water from far underground when 333

there is not much rainfall. And, as we already know, their branches are covered by sharp 349

thorns. These help keep some animals from eating too many of them. These trees are right 365

at home in this habitat. 370

**15. “The Tropical Rainforest Habitat”**


Tropical places are warm and wet. A rainforest is a thick forest of plants that stay 16

green year-round. There are tropical rainforests in many places around the world close to 30

the equator. One rainforest is in South America, and is the largest tropical rainforest on 45

Earth. It is the Amazon rainforest. The Amazon rainforest is so dense that you can easily 61

get lost in it. It’s hot and very humid. The temperature is always very warm, and it rains 79

heavily all year long. There are between eighty and two hundred forty inches of rainfall 94

here every year. That makes this one of the wettest places you can find on land. 110


The Amazon rainforest has broadleaf trees. The trees stay green all year long. The 124

evergreen trees replace their leaves gradually throughout the year as the leaves age and fall. 139

The trees always look green and never have bare branches. Because the climate is the same 155

all year round, plants do not need to slow down for cold winter weather. Animals that live 172

here always have a good supply of food all year, too. 183


The trees in the rainforest are incredibly tall. They grow as tall as thirteen-story 197

buildings, and some grow much taller than that! The trees grow so thickly and so close 213

together that from above, you can see only a canopy of thick green leaves. You can’t see the 231

forest floor at all. Because the sun’s light can’t get through this canopy of leaves, everything [247]

under them is really dark. 252


The plants in the Amazon rainforest have adapted to this climate in many ways. 266

Because it’s so dark in the rainforest underneath the canopy, most plants have large leaves 281

so they can catch as much light as possible. Many of the plants have waxy leaves with ends 299

that are tapered to help the water drip off them, like the water running off an umbrella. 316


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **61**


Because the trees are so tall, they often have large roots that help hold them up. Also, 333

their trunks are covered in smooth, thin bark. The trees don’t need thick bark to protect 349

them from cold weather. There are even some plants that grow high up on tree trunks and 366

branches so that they can get to the sunlight that doesn’t reach the forest floor! 381

» The climate is the same all year round so plants don’t need to slow down
their growth to adjust to cold weather. Because plants don’t need to slow
down their growth, they stay green all year long and gradually replace old
leaves. The trees are never bare and thus, animals have food all year long.

4. _**Literal**_ How have plants adapted to the rainforest habitat?


» growing large leaves to catch light; growing waxy leaves to help water

**16. “The Saltwater Habitat”**


Saltwater habitats contain lots of salt. This means that we can’t use saltwater for 14

drinking. It’s hard to imagine, but more of the earth is covered in water than is covered 31

with land. Most of that water is saltwater in oceans and seas. Oceans are huge areas of 48

saltwater that stretch all around our planet, and they are home to almost half of the world’s 65

species of animals and millions of different plants. The water in the ocean comes from 80

rain as well as from rivers and streams that flow into the ocean. Seas are smaller areas of 98

saltwater that have land around them or around part of them. 109


The largest ocean is the Pacific. The beach, and any land that runs alongside the 124

ocean, is called the coastline or shoreline. You may think that when you are standing on 140

the land looking at the water that the land stops where the water starts. It certainly looks 157

that way. But there is land is under the water. The land slopes downward the farther you 174

go out into the water, which means the water is getting deeper and deeper. 188


The interesting thing about the ocean floor, which is the land under the ocean water, 203

is that it isn’t flat. As on land, the earth beneath the ocean waters has both mountains and 221

valleys. This makes some areas of water in the ocean deeper than others. 234


The Pacific Ocean is full of both plant and animal life, but not all of them share the 252

same space. The conditions under the water are very different in various places. Some 266

parts are deep and some are shallow. There are cool parts and there are warm parts. Some 283

are dark and some are full of light. 291


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **65**


There are plants and animals in nearly every part of the ocean. Some live way out 307

in the deep, open waters far from the land, and some live in the shallow waters closer to 325

the shore. Some animals, like turtles, jellyfish, and crabs, live closer to the shore where 340

it’s shallower and warmer. If you have ever been to the beach and walked in the water 357

splashing on the sand, you’ve been in this shallow part of the ocean. 370

**17. “The Sonoran Desert Habitat”**


There are many deserts all over the world. You know you’re in a desert when it doesn’t 17

rain very much. Many deserts can also be very hot. Because it’s so hot and dry, not too 35

many plants or animals can live there. 42


The Sonoran Desert is in the southwestern part of the United States and the 56

northwestern part of Mexico. The temperature is quite hot during the day, and it doesn’t 71

rain very much. The heat and lack of rain make it hard for plants and animals to live in the 91

desert. They must all be specially adapted to live in the hot weather and survive with very 108

little rain. 110


How do they do it? Some plants can save and store water inside their plant parts when 127

it does rain. Other plants grow only in shady areas near mountains or rocks. 141


Since there are very few plants that can be used as shelter, the animals that have 157

adapted to living in the desert often make their homes underground. Living underground 170

helps them to stay cool when it gets hot, and keeps them hidden from other animals that 187

may want to eat them for lunch! 194


The saguaro cactus is the world’s largest cactus. Cacti don’t have leaves. They have 208

prickly spines instead. The incredible saguaro lives for up to two hundred years. In that 223

time can grow as high as a house and weigh as much as several cars! The most amazing 241

thing about the saguaro is that it is a habitat in itself. Not only does it manage to thrive in 261

the desert habitat, but it provides food, water, and shelter to many different animals. 275


It hardly ever rains in the desert, but when it does, the saguaro cactus saves and stores 292

huge amounts of water in its roots and stems. The cactus saves the extra water and uses it 310

to survive during those times when it is very dry and does not rain. 324


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **69**


In the spring, white flowers grow on the saguaro. At night, when the desert cools 339

down, these flowers open to show sweet nectar, which butterflies, bats, and birds feed on 354

before the flowers close the next day when it once again becomes very hot. In the summer, 371

red fruit begins to grow on the saguaro. Many animals eat the fruit of the cactus. 387

**18. “Animals of the Arctic Habitat”**


Let’s take a tour of one of the coldest habitats on Earth: the Arctic tundra. In the 17

tundra, there aren’t very many plants. In fact, there are no trees at all. The Arctic tundra is 35

very, very cold. The wind is incredibly strong, which makes the air feel even colder. The 51

ground is frozen and nearly everything is covered in ice. In the winter, daylight lasts only a 68

few hours, and at times the sun does not come out at all. The temperatures are so low that 87

most people and animals would freeze. All of these things make the Arctic tundra one of 103

the least friendly habitats on Earth for plants and animals. Some ice will still be here in the 121

summer, but the top layer of ice melts so that the ground gets wet and muddy. 137


Some plants and animals can only live in the Arctic tundra in the summer months 152

when the temperature is warmer. Some plants and animals are able to live there all year 168

long. Arctic plants grow very close together and do not grow very tall, which keeps them 184

from being blown away by the Arctic winds. The kinds of plants include mosses and 199

different types of grasses. 203


The animals that call the Arctic tundra habitat home all year round have adapted 217

to the harsh conditions. This means the animal has changed over the years and now has 233

special things that help it live in that habitat. For example, animals in the Arctic often have [250]

heavy fur coats that help them stay warm in the cold temperatures. 262


One creature that has adapted to the Arctic tundra habitat is called a muskox. It is 278

adapted to the Arctic in several ways. The muskox’s long shaggy coat has an extra layer of 295

hair underneath that keeps it warm when the temperature is frigid. The muskox sheds its 310

extra coat of hair in the warmer, summer months. 319


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **73**


Muskoxen travel in herds so they can huddle together for added warmth. They also 333

have hooves specially adapted to this habitat. Their hooves are very wide to keep them 348

from slipping on the snow and ice, and in the winter muskoxen use their sharp hooves to 365

dig under the snow to find plants to eat. 374

**19. “The Freshwater Habitat”**


A lake is an area of water that is surrounded by land. There is a lot of water in the 20
world; in fact, water covers most of the earth’s surface. But, only a tiny part of the world’s 38
water is freshwater, the kind of water you can drink. 48


Freshwater is found in streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds. The water in these streams, 62
rivers, lakes, and ponds comes from rain and from melting ice and snow. Isn’t it amazing 78
to think that the water from the drinking fountain at school or from the faucets in your 95
house all comes from rain? 100


Freshwater habitats have many kinds of fish, birds, insects, and other animals. Some 113
lakes have water lilies. A water lily is a plant that lives in water near the edges of ponds and 133

lakes. Plants are important in freshwater habitats because they make oxygen for animals to 147

breathe. Plants are also food for the animals to eat, and they can provide shelter to protect 164

animals from their predators. The leaves of the water lily are very large, round, and green, 180

and they float on the surface of the water. The water lily is well adapted for living in this 199

habitat. The lily’s large leaves let it get as much sunlight as it needs for food and energy. 217


Lilies are also food for many animals. Animals—like deer, porcupines, beavers, and 230

turtles—all eat the leaves, while ducks and geese like to eat their roots. Some animals, like 247

fish and frogs, use the lily leaves as hiding places, and the flowers bring bees and other 264

insects. 265


Another plant that lives in lakes is called a cattail. This plant gets its name from the 282

unusual way it looks. Cattails have long, thin stems with foot-long, furry, flower spikes at 297

the top that turn from green in the early summer to brown in the fall. The flower spike 315

feels soft and furry and looks a little like a cat’s tail. The plants can reach up to nine feet in 336

height, which lets them get as much sunlight as they need. 347


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **77**


As with water lilies, some animals use cattails for food and shelter. Muskrats and geese 362

like to eat the roots of the cattail, and the juicy green shoots are a favorite of moose and 381

elk. Many kinds of birds make their homes among the cattails. Cattails grow so thickly, so 397

it’s a good place for birds to build their nests and to lay and hatch their eggs. Predators like 416

snakes and frogs also live among the cattails and search for animals like birds and insects 432

for food. 434

**20. “Confucius”**


Long ago in China, a baby was born. Known as Confucius, he was born at a time 17

when all of China was experiencing great troubles. China, an enormous country, was 30

divided into small areas ruled by many different leaders. No two leaders agreed with one 45

another. They formed large armies and fought long wars against one another. Robbers 58

rode through the countryside hurting other people. Greedy leaders wanted to conquer all 71

of China for their own selfish reasons. 78


Confucius was born into a poor family more than two thousand years ago. His father 93

died when he was very young. His mother believed that education was important and 107

made sure that he learned from the wise teachers in his village. Confucius also taught 122

himself many subjects. He learned that China had not always been so divided. It had 137

once been a peaceful, united country ruled by wise men who wanted to help their people. 153

Confucius began to dream of a time when people could live in a peaceful land led by wise 171

sages once again. He wanted to spread the word that it was possible to live without wars 188

and confusion. He wanted to give people hope for a better tomorrow. 200


Confucius decided to spend his life educating others and teaching them how to 213

live in a more peaceful way. As he taught his students how to build a peaceful country, 230

Confucius would often begin his lessons by asking them to start with their own families. 245

Confucius reasoned that if people could not get along in small groups, how could they 260

expect their leaders to control the behavior of whole cities and towns? Confucius believed 274

that if people always treated one another with kindness, the world would be a better place. 290

Confucius also believed that if leaders were able to stop all wars, feed the hungry, and 306

make sure that people were safe in their cities and towns, everyone could live in a happier 323

world. 324


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **81**


In addition, Confucius believed that education was very important. He thought that 336

it was necessary to study and learn all the time. In ancient China, only people with money 353

were allowed to go to school. Confucius thought that this was wrong. He believed that 368

all people, rich and poor, should have equal opportunities to learn. Learning never stops, 382

according to Confucius. 385

**21. “China’s Great Wall”**


Long ago, in the cold, northern lands beyond the boundaries of China, a group of 15

nomads lived by raising animals. They rode on horses, herding sheep and goats in search 30

of grass for grazing. Life was hard for these nomadic people. Perhaps that is why they 46

became such fierce warriors. They regularly crossed into China on horseback, stealing 58

food, gold, and animals. 62


The Chinese thought of many ways to keep the attackers out. All along the northern 77

border of China they built walls of earth, stone, and wood. The materials they used 92

depended upon what was readily available in the areas where they lived. For hundreds of 107

years, the Chinese built many separate walls to keep out northern invaders. But it was not 123

until the rule of China’s “First Emperor” that the decision was made to connect the many 139

walls together into one long wall. That was over two thousand years ago. 152


Work continued on the Great Wall for another fifteen hundred years! Soldiers, 164

prisoners, and peasants struggled to obey the orders of each new and powerful emperor of [179]

China who wanted to finish the wall. It was not an easy task. The wall stretched out across 197

the land, often built on the highest ground, like mountain ridges, to make it even more 213

difficult for invaders to cross. The work was very dangerous, and many workers died in 228

the process. 230


Spanning four thousand miles across northern China, the Great Wall was built to act 244

like a fort. At places along the way, watchtowers were built. At one time there were nearly 261

twenty-five thousand watchtowers. Soldiers kept watch for invading warriors. If they 272

sensed danger, they used flags and drums to send signals from tower to tower. 286


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **85**


With all of that hard work, do you think the Great Wall protected the Chinese as 302

planned? It did for much of Chinese history. There were times, however, when some 316

determined warriors broke through the wall. On two occasions, lasting for hundreds of 329

years each, nomads from Central Asia forced the Chinese people to live under their rule. 344

**22. “The History of Writing in China”**


Instead of using letters from the alphabet, the Chinese language uses characters. A 13

character is a symbol or picture used in a system of writing to represent spoken words. 29

Each character represents a different spoken word or group of words. There are over 43

fifty-six thousand Chinese symbols, or characters, compared to the twenty-six symbols, 54

or letters, of the English alphabet. Most Chinese use only eight thousand in their everyday 69

lives. 70


The writing system used in China today is very much like the one developed in the 86

Yellow River Valley over three thousand years ago. It is quite remarkable to think that the 102

Chinese are still writing with many of the same characters that their ancestors used many 117

years ago. 119


How do we know that the Chinese writing system has survived all these years? Well, 134

it has to do with a recent discovery of a most unusual writing surface. Today you write on 152

paper. But Chinese farmers, digging in their fields, unearthed writing on a surface quite 166

different from paper. 169


This unusual writing surface is bone! Long before paper was invented, the Chinese 182

used ox bones and the hard protective underbellies of large river tortoises. For thousands 196

of years, the Chinese also wrote on clay pottery, metal vases, silk cloth, wood, and bamboo 212

strips. Bamboo, a woody plant that grows like a weed, was split and scraped to make the 229

smooth, writing surface. 232


Grades 4 and 5 **Fluency Supplement** **89**


The Chinese invented paper! The first paper was made from a rope-like plant. This 246

first paper was very thick and rough. They continued to experiment with other materials, 260

like tree bark, fishing nets, wheat stalks, and cloth rags. They wanted to create a softer, 276

smoother, lighter writing surface. Finally, a man discovered the right combination of 288

materials for a paper that was just right and less expensive to create. 301


After creating a good paper, Chinese inventors came up with a solution for printing
315
more books. Block printing was invented. The text, written on a thin piece of paper,
330
was glued facedown to a wooden block. Then, each character was carved out to make a
346
woodblock printing plate. A separate block was created for each page of the book. If you
362
made a mistake, you had to start all over again! The method wasn’t perfect for sure, but
379
the Chinese never gave up. Over the years they developed better methods that spread
393
throughout the world.

**23. “The Importance of Silk”**


Explorers risked their lives, traveling out from Europe, Asia, and Africa, in search of 14

new lands and people. These explorers were not disappointed by what they found. Their 28

discoveries included new types of clothing, tools, and everyday objects. And, as so often 42

happens when people encounter new things, they wanted what the others had. 54


Thus, trade began between people from different lands. Over time, people from one 67

area of the world started to take the same paths for trade to other areas of the world. One 86

of the longest and most important trade routes was a web of roads known as The Silk 103

Roads. These roads joined towns and shipping ports along the Mediterranean Sea and 116

East Africa, to towns in the northernmost parts of China. For many hundreds of years, 131

Chinese inventions spread to other continents along the five thousand miles of The Silk 145

Roads. 146


Silk is a very fine cloth known for its light, strong texture. Silk is often used to make 164

clothing, scarves, neckties, and decorative wall hangings. In fact, the Chinese used silk to 178

send arrows flying on curved wooden bows, for musical instruments, and for fishing lines. 192

Silk is so strong that the early Chinese even used it for paper and money! But silk is not a 212

good material for building roads. 217


The name “The Silk Roads” has nothing to do with the material used to build the 233

roads. Rather, this long network of roads was named for the beautiful silk fabric, invented 248

by the Chinese. For many years silk was the main item traded on these roads. People 264

wondered how to make this fabric. It had the ability to keep one warm in the winter and 282

cool in the summer. They were willing to travel long distances over dangerous ground to 297

buy and trade goods in exchange for the silk cloth. For many years, the Chinese kept how 314

they made silk a deep secret. 320

Silk comes from special moths on mulberry trees. The moths are blind and unable to 335

fly. They lay hundreds of tiny eggs, each about the size of a pinhead, on these leaves. When 353

the eggs hatch, caterpillars appear and begin munching on the mulberry leaves. Each 366

fattened caterpillar spins a single long thread around itself, forming a cocoon. 378


The Chinese discovered how to stop the growth of these caterpillars in order to 392

make the fine, silk thread. Chinese women began collecting the eggs of the silkworms. 406

Placing them in special trays, they fed chopped up mulberry leaves to the newly hatched 421

caterpillars and waited for them to spin their cocoons. Once the spun cocoons rested for 436

nine or ten days, they were baked to kill the caterpillars inside. Then the cocoons were 452

plunged into hot water to loosen the thread so that it could be unwound and woven into 469

fine cloth. This same process is still used in China and other silk-producing countries 483

today. 484

QUESTIONS



**Comprehension Questions**
**“The Importance of Silk”**

_Assess each student’s comprehension of the selection by asking him or her to respond orally to_
_the following questions one on one with you:_


1. _**Literal**_ What were The Silk Roads?


» a long web of important trade routes, named for silk, the main item
traded on these roads.


2. _**Literal**_ What did people use silk to make?


» clothes, bows, musical instruments, and fishing line


3. _**Inferential**_ What role do special moths play in the making of silk?


» The caterpillars of special moths are important for making silk. Nine or
ten days after a caterpillar spins a cocoon, the spun cocoon is baked to kill
the caterpillar inside. Then the cocoon is plunged into hot water to loosen
the thread so it can be unwound and woven into a fine cloth.


4. _**Evaluative**_ Why might the Chinese have kept the process of making silk a
secret for as long as they could?


» Answers may vary, but could include that people were willing to travel
long distances to buy and trade goods in exchange for the silk cloth. If
the Chinese were the only ones who knew how to make this cloth, people
would go to great lengths to get the cloth, which would mean the Chinese
could trade for other things that may be worth even more than silk.
