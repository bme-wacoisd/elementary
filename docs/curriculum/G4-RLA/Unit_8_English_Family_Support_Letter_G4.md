# **Welcome!**
#### **Grade 4, Unit 8**
## **Geology: This Rock You're** **Standing On**

Dear Family Member,

In this unit, students will learn about Earth's layers and geological features.

### **What's the story?**

Students will learn that the earth is composed of **layers** that, through heat and pressure,
cause movements that result in **geological features** above and below the earth's surface.
They will also explore the relationships between those different **geological processes** and
how they affect the **landscape** and related **environments** of the earth.

### **What will my student learn?**

Students will learn about the scientific theory of **plate tectonics** and how it explains the
presence of **volcanoes, mountains, underwater trenches, ridges**, and other geological
features. They will also study geological processes like **rock formation**, **weathering**, and
**erosion** to understand how the earth changes over time and why it looks the way it does.


Students will review the stages of the writing process and engage in several **short writing**
**projects** . They will have many opportunities to write, some of which include **drafting an**
**informational pamphlet** about tsunamis, writing an **informational flyer** about a specific
volcano, and creating a **descriptive paragraph** about a type of rock or item in the rock cycle.
