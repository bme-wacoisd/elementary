##### Introduction


~~**POETRY: WONDROUS WORDS**~~


This introduction includes the necessary background information to teach the Poetry unit. This unit
contains eleven daily lessons, a Unit Assessment, plus two Pausing Point days that may be used for
differentiated instruction. Lessons and activities address various aspects of a comprehensive language
arts curriculum. Each lesson will require a total of ninety minutes. Lesson 12 is devoted to a culminating
Unit Assessment. It is recommended you spend no more than fourteen days total on this unit.


For many readers—adults and children alike—poetry can be challenging. Readers often find poems
inaccessible, suspecting a secret meaning they cannot decode. In fact, poetry’s reliance on symbolic
and figurative language opens up rather than closes off meaning, giving readers the power of personal
interpretation. This unit gives students tools and strategies for approaching poetry, training them in
the methods and devices poets use and equipping them to read and interpret both formal and free
verse poems. It gives them continual opportunities to create poems themselves, allowing them to
practice what they have learned.


The poems in this unit represent a wide variety of time periods, from Kshemendra’s twelfth-century
treatise on the responsibilities of poets to the work of living writers such as Pat Mora. We haven’t
chosen poems written specifically for children; we have instead selected poems both younger and
older readers will enjoy. The poets come from many backgrounds and nations. The poems themselves
are similarly diverse; some employ precise meter and rhyme schemes, while others use free verse.
Uniting them all is their engagement with language and its potential.


A central goal of this unit is teaching students how to explore that potential. The American poet Emily
Dickinson once compared poetry to “possibility,” perhaps a surprising metaphor in her time, but one
that has proven apt. Poems are often multi-dimensional, using figurative language to yoke together
apparent opposites, to allow imagination and creativity to flourish, to startle readers with glimpses
of the world as it might be. Rather than conceal one secret meaning available only to privileged
readers who understand how to unlock a poem, the best poems open themselves to many possible
interpretations. To that end, this unit encourages students to express their views on a poem, and it
shies away from listing one “correct” meaning.


Introduction
**1**


**2**



That’s not to say that wrong interpretations are impossible—Walt Whitman, who died in 1892, did
not write poems about World War I. However, many student responses are valid, so long as those
interpretations are rationally supported by evidence from the poem’s text.


This unit, which focuses on poetry, is like others in this curriculum in routinely encouraging and
enabling students to read texts purposefully and carefully. To accomplish that, and in recognition
of the differences between poetry and other genres of writing, this unit’s structure, materials, and
activities differ at times from those of other units. Throughout the unit, students practice reading
and writing. They learn about many of the formal elements of poetry as they identify those elements
arising organically from the text.


They also pair that work with practicing as poets themselves. This allows them to demonstrate
their understanding and analysis of the poems through creative application and to become detailed
writers. In turn, this bolsters their ability to analyze others’ writing. These activities offer students
a number of tools with which to approach poetry, building their confidence to interpret poems and
their engagement in the task. Writing activities train students in the craft of poetry, celebrating their
creative potential and imagination while training them to apply and master the knowledge they have
gained from reading and understanding the unit’s poems. Activities allow students the chance to
explore poetic devices, imitate strategies used by the poets they have studied, and learn to think as
poets by considering how the formal choices they make influence the poem’s meaning.


**Why These Poems Are Important**


This unit uses a variety of poems that have been analyzed for complexity and chosen for their diversity
and interest. These poems are particularly good preparation for the complex texts, vocabulary, and
form students will encounter in Grade 5 and beyond. For more information about the quantitative
and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text
Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


Lesson 1


“Wonderful World” and Norman Ault’s “Wishes” both present accessible content (an appreciation
for the natural world and a desire to be king) and structure (statements/questions and answers). By
pairing the poems, students learn how a basic form, such as the question poem, can gain structural
complexity through the inclusion of answers. “Wonderful World” captures the world and its beauty
through sensory imagery. Ault’s poem uses meter and rhyme to shape a melodious description of
human wishes and desire.


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


Lesson 2


Students will recognize that the speaker in Nikki Giovanni’s “My First Memory (of Librarians)” is
remembering a time when she was approximately their age. However, the library she describes differs
dramatically from many twenty-first-century libraries, giving students the opportunity to practice
reading a text carefully for detail and evidence. Giovanni’s poem offers students what might be their first
encounter with free verse, showing them that poetry need not be bound by formal constraints. Students
will be drawn to the narrative qualities and to the rich visual details Giovanni offers in the piece.


Lesson 3


Langston Hughes’s “Harlem,” a classic poem, uses a series of similes to consider the cost of deferring
one’s dreams. Through colorful language such as _fester_ and _stink_, Hughes implies the answer to his
series of questions. Students may use these diction clues to infer the poem’s meaning: that one
should not defer one’s dreams.


Lesson 4


Walt Whitman’s classic poem “I Hear America Singing” proceeds in free verse, the poet’s preferred
form, and uses repetition of the word _singing_ to demonstrate how his countrymen are united through
their diverse labors. Whitman bypasses typical characterizations of the United States and the jargon
associated with those characterizations; he describes what that looks like to everyday Americans
going through their work day. By describing the nation through portraits of its working-class residents,
Whitman underscores his faith in the individual and his affection for humanity.


Lessons 5 and 6


N. Scott Momaday’s “The Delight Song of Tsoai-talee” invites readers to think about what it means
to be alive while making metaphorical connections to nature and using anaphora as a structural
literary device. The anaphora structure’s simplicity is age-appropriate and reduces cognitive load,
allowing students to focus on analyzing the metaphors, which hinge upon both living and nonliving
components.


Pronunciation Guidance: Tsoai-talee: pronounced [ts’oh-igh-tahl-yee] (The ts’ makes a sharp /z/

sound) Tsen-tainte: pronounced [tsayn-t’ighn-day] (The second t makes an emphasized /t/ sound)

_It is an important cultural note that there have been multiple iterations of Kiowa vocabulary which_

_attempt to turn the tonal sounds into a phonetic alphabet. The pronunciations written above are the_

_closest to the Kiowa pronunciation. For additional cultural context, in the Kiowa written language, the_

_words are written as follows: Tsêñt’àiñ:dè [tsayñ-t’ighñ-day], Ts’òâitàlyì: [ts’oh-igh-tahl-yee]_


Introduction
**3**


Lesson 7



**4**



Pat Mora’s “Words Free as Confetti” celebrates words in both English and Spanish, using all five senses
to describe the possibilities of language and the poet’s delight in those possibilities. It celebrates
words’ diversity, their color, and their ability to liberate their speakers. The poem’s narrator dances
through sound, using English and Spanish words to highlight the variation of language and delighting
in the way words appear tactile. A member of the Appendix B text list, this poem offers appropriate
rigor for students approaching the end of the poetry unit; more importantly, it presents the poet’s
genuine delight in language and its possibilities.


Lesson 8


Carl Sandburg’s poem “Fog” is a classic twentieth-century American poem. The extended metaphor

renders the fog vividly and descriptively, adding nuance and depth to the poem’s imagery. Sandburg’s

work presents no human characters, but by endowing the fog with agency and consciousness, it

brings the commonplace weather phenomenon to life and demonstrates the imaginative possibilities

of figurative language.


Lessons 9 and 10


Ernest Lawrence Thayer’s poem “Casey at the Bat” uses diction, voice, and tone to craft the dramatic story

of Casey and the hopes of his fans, who invest all their ambitions into their baseball team’s star player. The

poem’s content raises provocative questions concerning the role of heroes and the nature of fandom, while

its rhyme and meter lend a musical quality to the poem, helping pace students through the work.


Lesson 11


Kshemendra’s excerpt, from a twelfth-century text on poets and poetry, offers a view of the timeless

role poets play in society. By focusing overtly on the responsibilities of poets, this poem challenges

students to consider how poetry remains a distinctive craft. The poem’s call for exploration and

attentive engagement will serve students well in any pursuit, though it also offers a useful springboard

for students to consider how they might continue developing as poets beyond this unit.


**Prior Knowledge**


This unit builds on the literature and reading skills students have developed in previous grades.


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


~~**INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS: GRADE 4 POETRY COMPONENTS**~~


The Grade 4 Poetry unit has slightly different components from other units, to match its approach:


**Teacher Guide**


Each Teacher Guide includes daily lessons that provide detailed directions for comprehensive poetry

instruction. Lessons, instruction, and exercises in the Teacher Guide should be taught in the order

listed. The lessons also suggest group sizes for instruction and exercises (e.g., whole group, small

group, partners, independent). You should use your discretion in following the grouping suggestions

and consider students’ needs.


**Reader for this Unit**


The poems and glossary for this unit can be found in the Grade 4 _Anthology: Personal Narratives,_

_Contemporary Fiction, and Poetry_ . The _Poet’s Journal_ serves as the student workbook and contains

activity pages tied to each instructional lesson. Activity pages provide additional practice for

students to review material, answer questions, and complete activities designed to increase their

comprehension of that material, and compose original writing as a means of applying what they

have learned.


~~**WRITING**~~ ~~**TEKS 4.2.C**~~


A key aspect of the Poetry unit is encouraging and equipping students to write original poems.
This allows for creative and imaginative expression, but it also affords students the opportunity
to implement the poetic devices they have learned in the reading components of each lesson. The
writing portion of the unit allows students to apply their new poetry knowledge, further solidifying
their understanding of the craft of poetry. Throughout this unit, students will practice using the poetic
devices exemplified by each poem. They will compose rhymes, similes, and metaphors; use repetition,
anaphora, and alliteration; and plan, draft, and revise several original poems inspired by the poems
studied in this unit.


The _Poet’s Journal_ has been designed to reinforce the unit’s integration of reading and writing
poetry. The journal resembles a writer’s notebook rather than a textbook or student workbook. By
synthesizing comprehension activities and writing components, the _Poet’s Journal_ indicates the extent
to which reading, writing, and understanding poems are inherently connected. The _Poet’s Journal_ also
contains extra pages to encourage students to compose their own poems—something the unit’s final
lesson will set them up to accomplish.


In Grade 4, students will write legibly in cursive to complete assignments. Writing legibly includes

knowledge of how to connect letters, use appropriate spacing and letter height. In order to master

these skills, encourage students to complete activities in cursive throughout the unit.


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.

~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available in the program’s online materials. This
component was created to accompany materials for Grades 4 and 5. It consists of selections from
a variety of genres, including poetry, folklore, fables, and other selections. These selections provide
additional opportunities for students to practice reading with fluency and expression (prosody). There
are sufficient selections so you may, if desired, use one selection per week. For more information on
implementation, please consult the supplement.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


Throughout this unit, teachers will use the Speaking and Listening Observational Checklist to assess
student progress. See the Teacher Resources at the end of this Teacher Guide.

**Why We Selected It**


“Wonderful World” and Norman Ault’s “Wishes” both present accessible

content (a curiosity about the natural world/a desire to be king) and structure

(statements/questions and answers.) By pairing the poems, students learn

how a basic form, such as the question poem, can gain structural complexity

through the inclusion of answers. “Wonderful World” captures the world and its

beauty through sensory imagery. Ault’s poem uses meter and rhyme to shape

a melodious description of human wishes and desires.

**Reading for Understanding**


1. **Literal.** Ask students to look at the poem and identify what the words on the

first line have in common.


» They all start with the letter _W_ .


2. **Literal.** Let’s re-read the last line of this poem. _Dazzling days dance into the_

_night._ Can days really ‘ _dance_ ’?


» No.


 - Explain to students that this is a type of figurative language called

personification. Personification means that a nonhuman thing or idea is

represented as having a human quality. Authors use personification to help

readers create mental images and connections to their poetry. Ask students to

turn to Poet’s Journal 1.1 and complete questions 1–2.


 - Read the end of the poem again, then use words from the poem to answer the

questions below.


**Poet’s Journal 1.1**


1. Say: Let’s re-read the last line of this poem. _Dazzling days dance into the_

_night._ Can days really ‘ _dance_ ’? This is a type of figurative language called

personification. Personification means that a nonhuman thing or idea is

represented as having a human quality. Authors use personification to help

readers create mental images and connections to their poetry.


2. Why might this person be asking all these questions?


» Answers will vary, as the question allows for student speculation. Possibilities

include that the person is amazed by the world. They may point out that these

descriptions are detailed and appealing to their senses.


Check for Understanding


What similarities do these lines have to one another?

» Each line is about the world and nature and mostly uses words that start

with the same letter.

**Primary Focus:** Students will define the terms _repetition_ and _alliteration_ and create

original work using alliteration. ~~**TEKS 4.10.D**~~


~~**REPETITION AND ALLITERATION (15 MIN.)**~~


**Introducing Repetition and Alliteration**


1. **Literal.** Which letter begins all of the words in the poem’s first line?


» _W_


 - Ask students to write the letter _W_ out to the side of the line, then look at the

remaining lines, seeing what letter begins most (though not always all) of the

words in each line. Have students write that letter to the side of the line.


» Line 1: _W_


Line 2: _0_


Line 3: _R_


Line 4: _L_


Line 5: _D_


 - Explain that _repetition_ is an important poetic device or tool used by some

poets to add emphasis; this poem repeats letters and sentence structure (the

questions), but other poems repeat specific words.


 - Tell students that when an author repeats the same letter or letters at the

beginning of closely connected words, the poet is using a poetic device

called _alliteration_ .


 - Explain that words must appear close together in order to be considered an

example of alliteration. For example, the sentence “Tommy wanted his lunch

early on Tuesday” does not contain alliteration, because the words “Tommy”

and “Tuesday” are too far apart.


 - Ask students to turn to Poet’s Journal 1.1 and complete questions 3–4 there.


**Note:** Students will use their own names for an additional alliteration activity

in Lesson 6, but you may wish to have them create acrostic poems now using

the names of family members or friends.


**TEKS 4.10.D** Describe how the author’s use of imagery, literal and figurative language such as simile and metaphor, and
sound devices such as alliteration and assonance achieves specific purposes.



Support


Provide examples of
alliteration for students to
review. Example: _My puppy_
_is furry, friendly, and feisty._

2. Look at the letters you wrote by each line of the poem. Now write five new

letters of the alphabet in the chart below, making sure not to repeat the ones

you wrote by the lines of the poem. Then fill in the chart, making sure that

each word you use starts with the letter on its line. The first line shows an

example from “Wonderful World”.


» Answers will vary.

|Col1|Animal|Verb or Action Word|Feeling|

|ex:_w_|_whimsical_|_whales_|_whirl_|
|letter 1:||||
|letter 2:||||
|letter 3:||||
|letter 4:||||
|letter 5:||||



Poets use repetition for different reasons. Sometimes they want to stress an

important thought or point. Sometimes they want to repeat certain letters or

sounds, as in rhyming words, to make their poem sound pleasing.


3. Once you have completed the chart above, use the words on each line to

form a sentence. Try to make each one a sentence that you find interesting.

You may revise the chart if you wish. Write your sentences on the lines below.


» Answers will vary.


 - If time permits, allow students to share their sentences with the class.


Check for Understanding


What are _repetition_ and _alliteration_ ?

» Repetition is using the same thing more than one time in a row.

Alliteration is repeating the same letter or letters at the beginning

of closely connected words.

##### Reading


**Primary Focus:** Students identify textual evidence to determine the implicit and

explicit meanings of Norman Ault’s “Wishes” and make comparisons between his

poem and the “Wonderful World” poem. ~~**TEKS 4.6.F; TEKS 4.6.G; TEKS 4.6.H**~~


~~**READ-ALOUD: “WISHES” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Introduce the Reading**


 - Tell students that the next poem is by Norman Ault, a British man known for

his poetry and his artistic abilities as an illustrator. As students listen to the

poem read-aloud, they should pay attention to differences between this poem

and “Wonderful World”.


 - Read the poem aloud.

 - Have a student read the Note to Student aloud. Discuss as needed to make

sure students understand the concept of a slant rhyme.


1. **Evaluative.** What does this poem have in common with the first poem,

“Wonderful World”?


» Both speakers of the poem use sensory imagery.


2. **Literal.** How many lines does this poem contain?


» twelve


3. **Literal.** How many stanzas does this poem contain?


» one


 - Ask volunteers to list the differences they observed in the Ault poem and

the “Wonderful World” poem. Many exist, and it’s fine if students volunteer a

range of answers. However, make sure students recognize that the Ault poem

consists of both questions and answers, rather than just statements.


 - Tell students that they will focus on the difference in structure, or the way that

Note to Student


Most rhyming words share
both a vowel sound and
a consonant sound. For
example, _keep_ and _sleep_
share a long _e_ sound and
the _p_ sound. Sometimes,
though, words do not have
the same vowel sound, but
only share a consonant
sound. An example from
the poem “Wishes” is _own_
and _crown_ . These words
share the _n_ sound at the
end, but the _o_ sounds
different in each word.
When words are not
perfect rhymes but still
share a final consonant
sound, they are called
_slant rhymes._


Challenge


Remind students that
rhyming pairs are usually
the last words of each line
that rhyme. Ask students
to identify the rhyming
patterns in “Wishes” by
circling rhyming pairs.


Support


If students struggle to
identify the speaker’s
desired profession, direct
them to the poem’s final
two lines for help.

~~**ABOUT THE POET**~~


**Norman Ault**


Norman Ault was born on December 17, 1880, in Birmingham, England. One

of eight children, Ault attended King Edward IV Grammar School in Essex,

England. While at school, Ault was recognized for his natural creative talents

and did remarkably well in both his art and architecture courses. His artistic

reputation continued to grow, and he received recognition by _The Artist_

magazine as a “particularly talented artist.”


With his wife, Lena, Ault created beautiful and imaginative children’s books,

such as _The Rhyme Book_ and _The Podgy Book of Tales_ . In 1920, Ault published

_Dreamland Shores_, a children’s book that paired poems with colorful and

whimsical paintings of magnificent adventures. In addition to being a scholar

of seventeenth-century British poetry, Ault was recognized by Oxford

University for his talent as a writer. He died on February 6, 1950.

Lesson 2 “My First Memory (of Librarians)”



**23**


**24**



**Why We Selected It**


Nikki Giovanni’s poem “My First Memory (of Librarians)” uses accessible

language and a conversational tone to describe the common experience

of visiting a library from the point of view of the poet as a child. Students

will recognize that the speaker is remembering a time when she was

approximately their age. However, the library she describes differs

dramatically from many 21st century libraries, giving students the opportunity

to practice reading a text carefully for detail and evidence. Giovanni’s poem

offers students their first encounter with free verse, showing them that poetry

need not be bound by formal constraints. Students will be drawn to the

narrative qualities and to the rich visual details Giovanni offers.


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Reading**


- The poem “My First Memory (of Librarians)” can be found in the Anthology.


- Prepare Component 1 and Component 2, found in the online materials for

this unit.

~~**VOCABULARY**~~


**Core Vocabulary**


**anticipation, n.** excitement about something before it happens


**bankers’ lights, n.** desk lamps used by bankers; their green shades were

believed to help deflect bright light and reduce strain on the eyes—an

important thing for people who spent their day poring over complex numbers

~~**READING SKILL: POINT OF VIEW (25 MIN.)**~~


**Point of View**


 - Tell students that today you are going to talk about different ways to

describe events.


 - Display Component 1 and review it with students. As you review it, ask

for volunteers to define the words (stanza, line, rhyme) reviewed in the

previous lesson.


**Poet’s Journal 2.1, Part 1**


There are many ways to write a poem, and poets have to make choices

about the way they want their poems to look and sound. They have to make

decisions about _content_ —the poem’s message—and _form_ —the poem’s

structure or appearance.

**TEKS 4.8.D** Explain the influence of the setting, including historical and cultural settings, on the plot; **TEKS 4.10.E** Identify
and understand the use of literary devices, including first-or third-person point of view.



Poet’s Journal 2.1



Lesson 2 “My First Memory (of Librarians)”
**25**


Note to Student


Did you know? Not all
poems rhyme! If a poem
does not rhyme or have
a set pattern of beats,
it is usually called a _free_
_verse_ poem.



When considering a poem’s form, poets have to decide:


- how many stanzas, or groups of lines, the poem will have


- how many lines each stanza will have


- whether or not the poem will include a rhyme scheme


When considering a poem’s content, poets have to decide:


- what their poem will be about (the poem’s subject or content)


- what message they want to present about their subject (For example, they

might want to describe their subject, or make a claim about it, or tell a story

about it. The poems we are reading in this unit all tell stories about a subject.)


- what angle or perspective they want to take on their subject, or who the

poem’s narrator will be (This is often referred to as point of view.)


- Tell students that the two most common points of view in poetry are first
person point of view and third-person point of view.


**Note:** This lesson does not address second-person point of view. However,

if students inquire why point of view goes from first to third, you may tell

them that these are the most common points of view, not the only ones.

Advanced students may be interested in learning that second-person point

of view, which uses you rather than I or he/she/it/they, is used in some

contemporary writing—but it is more common in how-to guides and recipes.


**Poet’s Journal 2.1, Part 2**


First-person point of view is used when speakers or narrators describe stories

or events that include them as characters. It often includes words such as I,

_me_, _my_, _we_, or _us_ .


For example, a student named Lauren might say:


“One time I dreamed I could fly.”


This would be first-person, since Lauren is talking about her own experience.

Lauren is a character in the sentence she narrates.


Third-person point of view is used when speakers or narrators describe stories

or events that do not include them as characters. It often uses words such as

_he_, _she_, _it_, or _they_ .


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words



**26**


For example, Lauren’s classmate José might describe Lauren’s dream:


“Once, Lauren dreamed she could fly.”


This would be third-person, since José is talking about someone else’s

experience. José is not a character in the sentence he narrates.


Here’s an example of how José might make his sentence first-person:


“Lauren told me that, once, she dreamed she could fly.”


This sentence is in first-person, since José is a character describing an event

from his perspective.


 - Direct students to Poet’s Journal 2.2 and ask them to complete numbers 1–7.


**Note:** This distinction between the kind of dream one has while sleeping

and the kind of dream to which one aspires often challenges students. It is a

crucial distinction for them to understand when studying Langston Hughes’s

poem “Harlem” in Lesson 3, so introducing it now will help build toward that

material.


**Poet’s Journal 2.2**


**Point of View**


Now that you understand the difference between first- and third-person,

practice applying that knowledge. On the line following each of the sentences

below, write whether it uses first- or third-person.


1. Emily dreamed of going on a trip to India with her uncle.


» third


2. I dreamed about riding a racehorse.


» first


3. My little brother dreamed of being president after he went to Washington, D.C.


» first


4. Austin had a dream about being a Major League baseball player.


» third



Note to Student


First-person point of view
is used when narrators
describe stories or events
from their perspective. It
often includes words such
_as I, me, my, we,_ or _us_ .

Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


~~**READ-ALOUD (25 MIN.)**~~


**Introduce the Poet**


 - Tell students that this lesson is about a poem titled “My First Memory

(of Librarians).”


 - Explain that, since the title reveals that it is a poem about a memory, it might

be useful to know a little bit about the author, Nikki Giovanni, before reading

the poem.


 - Ask students to turn to Nikki Giovanni’s biography in their Poet’s Journal; call

on students to read it aloud to the class.


 - Ask students to answer the following questions, which they may answer in

consultation with the biography.


1. **Literal.** What does Nikki Giovanni do for a living?


» She is an English professor and writer.


2. **Evaluative.** How do those jobs relate to books?


» An English professor teaches students about books, and a writer writes books of

her own.


3. **Inference.** Based on the relationship Giovanni has with books as an adult,

what do you imagine her feelings were about librarians as a child? Make sure

to explain how you reached your answer.


» Answers will vary, but students should use the biography to make inferences.

At this stage, it’s not crucial for them to predict correctly the content of the

poem; the goal is to get them thinking about how the biography might connect

to the poem. The end of the lesson will allow them to assess the success of

their inference.


**Introduce the Poem**


 - Distribute copies of the poem “My First Memory (of Librarians)” by Nikki

Giovanni to students.


 - Tell students to read along as they listen to the poem. Ask students to pay

attention to as many of the details as possible and to try to picture the room.


 - Read the poem aloud.

 - Direct students to Poet’s Journal 2.3. Review the instructions and ask students

to complete numbers 1–7.


**Poet’s Journal 2.3**


**Reading “My First Memory (Of Librarians)”**


Answer the following questions about Giovanni’s poem. Consult the poem for

words and details that can help you develop your answers.


1. Is this poem in first- or third-person? List the word or words in the poem that

make this clear.


» The poem is in first-person, as evidenced by the word _my_ .


2. Based on the title of the poem, what is the narrator describing? Put the

answer in your own words.


» Answers will vary due to paraphrasing, but possible answers include the first thing

she remembers, a visit to the library, and/or librarians.


Note: It is important for students to recognize both elements of this answer—the
act of remembering and the memory’s content. Doing so involves an attention
to detail that will help students read poetry more fluently and continues building
toward the duality poetry uses in figurative language such as metaphor and simile.


3. The narrator lists two reasons the chairs might not have fit her very well.

Name both reasons.


» The chairs were too low, and the narrator was too short.


4. The narrator describes the librarian’s smile. Based on the description, how

do you think the narrator felt about seeing the librarian? Give a reason for

your answer.


» Answers will vary, but the idea is to have students make an inference that is drawn

from the text. For example, they might say that the narrator likes seeing the

librarian because people like being welcomed rather than rejected.


5. In the final stanza, the narrator says she felt anticipation about visiting the

library. Using the third-person, write a sentence that describes, in your own

words, how the narrator felt when she was at the library.


» Answers will vary, but the key is that students are correctly interpreting the

term _anticipation_ .

6. When you read Nikki Giovanni’s biography, you were asked to think about

how she might have felt about libraries and librarians when she was younger.

Based on your answers to questions 4 and 5, does the poem show Giovanni

feeling the way you expected? Explain your answer.


» Answers will vary. The student’s accuracy isn’t the main point here; the goal is to

help students start to think about ways that biographical material might interact

with or inform the content of a poem.


7. How can books be like another world like the speaker describes in the next
to-last line of the poem?


» Answers will vary, but possibilities are that books help us learn about other worlds,

offer a break or chance to escape from everyday life, help us experience new

things, or present a fantasy. The goal is to get students thinking about Giovanni’s

figurative language.


 - If time permits, review some answers in class.


Check for Understanding


Summarize the whole poem in your own words. Student responses should
mention the literal visit to the library and the fact that the speaker is
remembering an event from her childhood.


~~**VISUALIZING DETAIL (25 MIN.)**~~


**Introducing Visual Exercise**


 - Tell students that they will now use the details of the poem to show what the

library looked like to the poet.


 - Direct students to Poet’s Journal 2.4. Review the instructions and tell students

to follow the prompts to imagine what the library looked like.


 - As students work, circulate and check in. Because this exercise asks students

to recreate the library from the poem, they must think and read carefully what

the poem reveals in terms of the room’s arrangement. Make sure students are

using the words of the poem to shape their choices.

Follow these steps to get started:


1. Look back at the poem and underline any words that help describe what the

library looked like.


2. For each item you underlined, think about how to draw that. Use the details

from the poem to help you. For example, does Giovanni remember that some

objects were big? Does she tell you the shape of the furniture? Think about

how these details can help you imagine what the room looked like.


3. Take one description and draw it in the space below. Make sure to think

about where in the space it should be located.


4. The narrator describes the entrance of the library, “In the foyer up four steps

a semi-circle desk _presided_ .” _Presided_ means to watch over or be in charge

of something. What figurative language is this an example of? What does it

make you imagine?


5. As you draw each thing, label it with a word from the poem that helped you

imagine how to draw it.


6. Keep adding objects to your library until it looks like the one in the poem.


If you feel stuck while you work, make sure to consult the poem, as it will help

you know where to put each image. If you finish with time remaining, re-read

the poem. Look for one more detail you could draw in your library.


 - Have students share their images in pairs, comparing their choices and

explaining their text-based reasons for those choices. If time permits, share a

few examples.


Check for Understanding


Call on students to volunteer a detail from the poem that they noticed for

the first time through this exercise.

**Primary Focus:** Students will record information about one of their own

experiences and plan a memory poem that includes sensory details and rich

description. ~~**TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.11.A; TEKS 4.12.A**~~


~~**PLANNING MEMORY POEMS (15 MIN.)**~~


**Brainstorming Material**


 - Direct students to Poet’s Journal 2.5, which asks them to write down a few

sentences describing one of their own memories. Students are expected to

write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.


 - Model this exercise by thinking aloud about each question and answering with

concrete details.


 - Students will use their description of the memory in a later class period, so

collect each Poet’s Journal and provide feedback on their work.


**Poet’s Journal 2.5**


**Planning Memory Poems**


Today’s lesson included Nikki Giovanni’s poem “My First Memory (of

Librarians),” a poem in which the narrator remembers an event from her

childhood and describes it with lots of detail. In this exercise, you’ll think about

a memory of your own, then answer some questions. If you don’t finish during

class time, you may complete your work at home.


1. Think about your favorite place. It might be a place where you go often, or

it could be a place you have only been once. When you have thought of the

place and remembered visiting it, write down the name of the place below.


» Answers will vary.


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.11.A** Plan a first draft by selecting a genre for a
particular topic, purpose, and audience using a range of strategies such as brainstorming, freewriting, and mapping;

2. Think about what you did in this place. Did you talk to anyone? Move around?

Do anything? Touch any objects? Leave anything there or take anything

when you left? Using the lines marked “2a” through “2d,” write down four

different things you did in this place.

3d.


» Answers will vary.


4. Now use your ears! Think about the sounds you heard in this place. Did

anyone talk to you? What did they say? Was music playing? Were there other

noises, or was it very quiet? Remember that, even in quiet places, you can

hear some noises—perhaps you heard your own breathing, or the wind, or

the air conditioner. Using the lines below, write down at least four sounds you

heard in this place.


4a.


4b.


4c.


4d.


» Answers will vary.


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


5. Now write down any other details you can remember about this experience.

These could include how the place feels, how the place smells, or any other

special detail that you remember and want to include.


5a.


5b.


5c.


5d.


» Answers will vary.


If you’ve answered all the questions, that’s great! If you haven’t, remember

that care matters more than speed.


Later in the poetry units you’ll use this exercise as the starting point for a

poem about your memory. To write a strong poem, you’ll need to have lots of

information, so make sure this is as complete as possible. If you remember

other details later, you should add them. Think of all the details Giovanni used

to help make her description memorable; try to do the same in your own work.


Check for Understanding


Ask student volunteers to share a descriptive detail they remembered
about their favorite place. If students focus on a particular type of detail,
encourage them to diversify. For instance, if they only mention actions and
sounds, urge them to consider smells, physical sensations, and so forth.

~~**ABOUT THE POET**~~


**Nikki Giovanni**


Yolande Cornelia “Nikki” Giovanni was born on June 7, 1943, in Knoxville,

Tennessee. She grew up in a suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio, but spent summers

visiting her grandparents in Knoxville. She loved hearing her grandmother’s

stories about her ancestors, which greatly influenced her own love for writing.

She explained in an interview, “I come from a long line of storytellers.”


Giovanni self-published her first book of poetry, _Black Feeling Black Talk_, in

1968. She has since published over two dozen books, including _Rosa_ and

_Hip-Hop_ _Speaks to Children_, and won many awards.


She prides herself on being “a Black American, a daughter, a mother, a

professor of English.” Her distinct and imaginative poetry is inspired by her

fascination with people and their emotions. It is also influenced by music and

her passion for social equality. She is currently a professor of English and

Black Studies at Virginia Tech.

Lesson 3 “Harlem”



**39**


**40**



**Why We Selected It**


Langston Hughes’s “Harlem” uses a series of similes to consider the cost of

deferring one’s dreams. Through colorful language, Hughes implies the answer

to his series of questions. Students may use these diction clues to infer the

poem’s meaning: One should not defer one’s dreams.


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Reading**


- The poem “Harlem” can be found in the Anthology.


- Prepare to arrange the class in pairs.


- Hand back _Poet’s Journals_ .


**Universal Access**


- Prepare vocabulary support for the words in “Harlem.”


- Prepare a word bank with lists of feelings, adjectives, and nouns, and sentence

frames for students to use in completing their similes.


- Prepare sentence frames to assist students in describing their memories.


~~**VOCABULARY**~~


**Core Vocabulary**


**defer, v.** to put off or delay


**deferred, adj.** postponed or delayed


**fester, v.** to grow infected


**renaissance, n.** a time period when many people are interested in big ideas

and in creating art, music, and literature


**Literary Vocabulary**


**figurative language, n.** words or phrases that mean more than their

dictionary definition; similes and metaphors are two examples of

figurative language


**literal meaning, n.** the dictionary definition of a word


**metaphor, n.** comparison that does not use _like_ or _as_

~~**INTRODUCTION TO “HARLEM” (20 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 4.6.C**~~


 - Tell students that they will focus on a poem by a writer named Langston

Hughes. This lesson will offer several different tools for thinking about and

understanding this important poem, titled “Harlem.”


 - Distribute copies of the poem “Harlem” by Langston Hughes to students.

Before they read the whole poem, ask them to look at its first line.


 - Explain that the rest of the poem discusses this one specific question, so it is

important to know what Hughes is asking.


 - Ask a volunteer to share the meaning of the word _deferred_, reminding students that

they may use the glossary at the back of the workbook to look up this definition.


1. **Evaluative.** How could you explain the meaning of Hughes’s question in your

own words?


» Answers will vary, but Hughes is asking what happens if you put off your dreams.


2. **Literal.** What are the two different kinds of dreams a person may have?


» the kind of dreams that you have while sleeping and the kind of dreams that are

your hopes and wishes


 - Tell students to predict what kind of dream Hughes will discuss in the poem.


 - Ask students to raise a hand silently if they predict the poem “Harlem” is

asking what happens if you put off dreaming at night. You may wish to select

one or two students to share their reasoning or supporting ideas with the class.


 - Ask students to raise a hand silently if they predict the poem “Harlem” is

asking what happens if you put off working toward your hopes and wishes. You

may wish to select one or two students to share their reasoning or supporting

the word _predict_ uses the
prefix _pre–_, which means
“to come before.” Ask
students why we might
make predictions before
we read.


**42**




- Remind students that this is just a prediction, so they will have to look carefully

at the poem to see which kind of dream Hughes is discussing.


- Tell students to read along silently as they listen to you read aloud the poem

by Langston Hughes.


Check for Understanding


What kind of dream is “Harlem” about?

» Answers may vary, but students should recognize that the poem is

about hopes and wishes, not dreams while sleeping.


- Ask students to raise their hand if their prediction was correct.


- Invite a few volunteers to ask questions about the poem until you have

generated a class list of several questions.


» Answers will vary, but prompt students to create open questions (e.g., “What is

the dream?”) that cannot be satisfied with a one-word answer.


- Tell students that you have some tools to help understand the poem better

and find answers to their questions. If possible, display the question list during

this lesson.


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


~~**FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE (30 MIN.)**~~


- Direct students to Poet’s Journal 3.1.


- Review Part 1.


Check for Understanding


Before moving to Part 2, ask students to explain literal and figurative
language in their own words.


- Review the directions for Part 2 and model the example. Then have students

work in pairs to determine possible meanings for each of the figurative

expressions listed.


**Poet’s Journal 3.1**


**Figurative Language in Poetry**


**Part 1**


One way to start understanding poetry is to understand the different kinds of

language poets use.


One thing that helps distinguish poetry from other forms of writing is its use

of language. Often when we hear a word, we think of its dictionary definition.

We call that its _literal meaning_ .


Example: Hand me that pen so I can sign Liam’s birthday card.


In this sentence the speaker is asking for an actual, literal pen, which we use

for writing. However, sometimes we mean something slightly different from

the literal meaning.



Poet’s Journal 3.1



Lesson 3 “Harlem”
**43**


Note to Student


The literal meaning of
a word is its dictionary
definition. The figurative
meaning of a word includes
all the associations,
symbols, and emotions
that might be connected
to the word.


**44**



Example: The pen is mightier than the sword.


When people say this, they do not literally mean that in a duel, the person

holding a pen would beat the person holding a sword. What they mean is

that words are often stronger than acts of violence. When people speak this

way, they are using something called _figurative language_ . A word’s figurative

meaning might be a symbol or representative of something else. The key is

that the figurative meaning contains ideas, emotions, or connections that

differ from the dictionary definition.


Although all writers may use the tools of figurative language, it appears in

poetry more frequently than in other kinds of writing.


**Part 2**


Now you will get to practice your own examples of figurative language!


Each item below lists a figurative statement. Your teacher will review the first

example. Then, working with a partner, name the literal meaning for each

figurative expression.


Example:


Figurative statement: I’m so hungry I could eat a horse!


Literal meaning: I am very hungry.


Figurative statements


1. It’s raining cats and dogs!


» It’s raining a lot!


2. The sun smiled on us!


» I’m very happy.


3. Don’t let the cat out of the bag!


» Don’t tell the secret!


4. It sank like a stone.


» It sank very easily.


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


 - Review the answers to questions 1–4. Ask students to explain the visual image

they have as they read the examples of figurative language. Discuss how each

of the examples creates an image.


 - When reviewing question 2, note that the statement, “The sun smiled on us”

is personification, because the sun is described as doing a human action:

smiling.


 - When reviewing question 4, note that the statement “It sank like a stone” is a

unique kind of figurative language known as _simile_ .


3. **Literal.** What is a simile?


» It is a comparison of two different things using the word _like_ or _as_ .


 - Tell students that the rest of this lesson will focus on similes because “Harlem”

uses so many of them.


~~**SIMILES (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students to listen to “Harlem” one more time and to follow along. As you read

the poem aloud, students should underline every simile.


 - Read “Harlem” aloud again.


 - Ask students to volunteer the similes they found.


 - Direct students to Poet’s Journal 3.2.


 - Model how to fill out the chart with simile A, working on the board and allowing

students to fill in the answers along with you.


 - Ask students to complete all four columns for B–E silently at their desks.

materials as you answer the following questions:


1. In one sentence, write the topic of your memory.


2. In revision, you developed a simile to show readers how you felt in this

memory. Copy that simile here.


3. Pick one important word that you want to stress as a way of showing your

poem’s tone. Write that word here.

5. Look back over your writing and revision. These exercises helped you

brainstorm, or gather lots of ideas about your memory, but you might not

need all those details in your poem. Narrow down your ideas to the three

most important details about your memory, and write them here. Next to

each detail, write why this detail will be so important to your poem.


A


B


C


Now think about the order in which the memory happened. What came first?

Second? Last? Put a number by items A through C to indicate the order of

events.


6. Look over your list. Using the space provided, write your poem. Make sure

to write the events in the order you indicated. Use the simile you wrote and

other details from your answers to help develop your poem. Don’t forget to

stress your important word to help readers understand your poem’s tone.


 - Tell students that if they have not finished their poems, they should complete

them this evening at home.

~~**ABOUT THE POET**~~


**Langston Hughes**


Langston Hughes was a poet, novelist, and playwright whose long career

inspired numerous other writers. Born on February 1, 1902, in Joplin, Missouri,

he moved to Lincoln, Ohio, at age thirteen. He began writing poetry there

and eventually became one of the most influential poets of the Harlem

Renaissance, a movement of African American artists and writers during the

1920s.


Hughes wrote about African American life between the 1920s and 1960s. His

experiences traveling the world influenced his poetry. His work covered many

different topics from beautiful things to ugly things. His style was compared

to jazz and blues music, perhaps due to its repetition and rhythm, or perhaps

because his poems are lyrical and emotional. Hughes was proud of his culture

and heritage, despite obstacles he faced. His poetry imagined a world of

equality. He died in 1967.

**Why We Selected It**


Whitman’s classic poem proceeds in free verse, the poet’s preferred form,

and uses repetition of the word _singing_ to demonstrate how his countrymen

are united through their diverse labors. Whitman bypasses typical

characterizations of the United States and the jargon associated with those

characterizations; he describes everyday Americans going through their work

day in detail. By describing the nation through portraits of its working-class

residents, Whitman underscores his faith in the individual.


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~

» Circulate as students practice tone, offering feedback as needed.


- Tell students that sometimes the tone and meaning of a statement depend

on which word or phrase is stressed or emphasized. This emphasis can be an

important tool for helping create a certain tone.


- Point out to students that the term emphasis refers to a weight, importance,

or value placed on a word, symbol, or idea. When you emphasize a specific

word in a sentence, phrase, or poem, you are adding more weight and

importance to that word—which can alter the overall meaning—as well as

giving readers clues about your tone.


- Tell students that they will now read their memory poems to their partners.

Instruct students to think about the tone of their poems as they read them

aloud.


**Read-Aloud in Pairs**


- Tell students that they will begin this lesson by sharing the original memory

poem they worked on throughout the previous lessons.


- Arrange students into pairs and tell them to turn to Poet’s Journal 4.1.


- Review instructions and tips for reading aloud successfully and providing

useful feedback.


- As students work, circulate and evaluate using the Speaking and Listening

Observational Checklist.


**Poet’s Journal 4.1**


**Providing Feedback**


Throughout the previous lessons, you have been working on your own memory

poem. Today you will get to share your poem aloud with a partner. Each person

will read their poem, then each listener will share responses to the questions

below.


When it is your turn to read your work aloud, remember to speak clearly

and slowly.


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


When it is your turn to listen to your partner, think about the following

questions as you listen to the poem. Take a minute to write down your answers

and share them aloud with your partner.

Remember that you should listen attentively to your partner. This means you

should think about what your partner is reading so that you are able to review

the key ideas your partner expresses in their poem. Make sure to look at your

partner while they read the poem aloud.


1. Using your own words, describe the main thing that happens in your

partner’s poem.


» Answers will vary based on the content of each poem; however, students should

be paraphrasing.


2. The previous lesson asked you to emphasize a word or phrase in your poem.

What word or phrase seems to be emphasized in your partner’s poem? You

may look at the written poem as you think about your answer; make sure to

give a reason for your answer.


» Answers will vary; the key is that students are reflecting on the text and its form.


 - Ask students to raise a hand if they added emphasis to a word or phrase in

their poem


   - through repetition


   - by placing it at a line break


   - through repetition and by placing it at a line break


Check for Understanding


Ask students to review the way an author might emphasize a word
or phrase.

» An author may add emphasis by repeating the word or phrase, or

by placing it on a line break.



Challenge


Ask students to think about
why the author selected
the emphasized words.
Why are they the poem’s
most powerful words?

##### Reading


**Primary Focus:** Students will identify how Whitman characterizes America and

make inferences about what Whitman most values about the nation.


~~**TEKS 4.6.F; TEKS 4.8.A; TEKS 4.9.B**~~


~~**READ-ALOUD (15 MIN.)**~~


**Introduce the Reading**


 - Explain that the rest of this lesson presents a poem that also uses repetition.

The poem is titled “I Hear America Singing.” It is by an American poet named

Walt Whitman. Just as students’ poems used repetition to emphasize an

important part of their memory, Whitman uses repetition to show what he

thinks is important about America.

 - Tell students to listen closely and to pick out the repeated words in the poem.

 - Read the poem aloud.


**I Hear America Singing**


**Walt Whitman**


I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,


Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong,


The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,


The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work,


The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand singing on

the steamboat deck,


The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as he stands,


The wood-cutter’s song, the ploughboy’s on his way in the morning, or at noon

intermission or at sundown,


The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work, or of the girl

sewing or washing,


Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,


**TEKS 4.6.F** Make inferences and use evidence to support understanding; **TEKS 4.8.A** Infer basic themes supported by text
evidence; **TEKS 4.9.B** Explain figurative language such as simile, metaphor, and personification that the poet uses to create images.


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


The day what belongs to the day—at night the party of young fellows,

robust, friendly,


Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.


1. **Literal.** Ask students what word they heard repeated most often.


» The word _singing_ is repeated most frequently, aside from articles (the), pronouns

(he), and conjunctions (or).


~~**REFLECTION AND INFERENCE (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain that Whitman describes the whole nation by focusing on some of its

parts—in this case, its people and their songs. To understand more about what

Whitman means, students must look at those songs more closely.


 - Ask a student volunteer to read the poem’s first line: “I hear America singing,

the varied carols I hear.”


1. **Evaluative.** When do we usually hear carols?


» Student answers will likely reference holidays such as Christmas, as they are the

most common association with the term today.


 - Explain to students that while many kinds of songs exist, carols are happy,

joyful songs, which is one reason we may sing them at holidays.


2. **Inferential.** By using the word _carol_, Whitman gives us a hint of how he feels

about America. What does this word choice tell us about Whitman’s feelings

for America?


» He likes it or believes it to be a happy place.


3. **Inferential.** Whitman also uses the adjective _varied_ to describe the carols.

What does the word _varied_ mean?


» different or diverse


 - Explain that Whitman reveals that the people in America are singing, but that

they sing very different songs.


4. **Literal.** Ask students to name all the different people who are singing in

the poem.


» The poem names the following singers: mechanics, the carpenter, the mason,

the boatman, the deckhand, the shoemaker, the hatter, the wood-cutter, the

ploughboy, the mother, the young wife at work, the girl sewing or washing.


 - You may wish to list these on the board or display area.

5. **Inferential.** The phrases Whitman uses to reference these singers are all

nouns that describe people by one particular thing. What is that thing?


» They describe people by their jobs.


 - If students are confused by the portrayal of females in this poem, explain to them

that by naming the responsibilities those women held (care of children is implied

in “mother”; Whitman specifies that the young wife is “at work” and the girl is

“sewing or washing”), Whitman is demonstrating that they, too, are working.


   - You may wish to remind students that in Whitman’s time women usually

did not work outside the home.


 - Tell students to turn to Poet’s Journal 4.2. Review the instructions, ask

questions 1 and 2 aloud as models for the class, then ask students to complete

questions 3–6 to help them think more closely about this metaphor.



~~**TEKS 4.8.A**~~

- Ask students to answer the STAAR Aligned Multiple Choice Question.

What is the theme of Walt Whitman’s poem, “I Hear America Singing?”


A. Work defines you


B. The power of singing


C. The beauty of diversity


D. Joy from a job well-done


» Correct Answer: C


**Poet’s Journal 4.2**


**Understanding Metaphor**



**60**



Up to now, the poems in this unit have used figurative language in clear ways.


However, poets do not always make their comparisons so directly. As readers,

one of the things we must figure out is whether or not Whitman is referring to

literal songs that people would sing out loud, if he is using the idea of singing

as a metaphor, or if he is doing both.


Consult the poem as needed to answer the following questions about how

Whitman uses metaphor.


1. At the end of the poem, Whitman writes, “Each singing what belongs to

him or her and to none else.” Using your own words, explain what Whitman

means here.


» All the people have their own unique songs.


**TEKS 4.8.A** Infer basic themes supported by text evidence.


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


2. Whitman makes sure to explain that the singers are all doing some kind of

work. Here, he is probably not saying that everyone is singing at their jobs!

Instead, he seems to compare work to singing. Write down ways that each of

the following kinds of work might be like singing.


shoemaking


» Answers will vary, but students should understand that shoemakers are creating

something, just as singers create music.


plowing a field


» Answers will vary, but students may connect preparing a field for planting seeds

with music as a way of expressing emotions or letting them blossom.


3. Think of a carpenter who is building a piece of wooden furniture. What kind

of noises might his tools make?


» Answers will vary, but students will likely think of the banging of the hammer, the

twang of a saw, and other such noises.


4. How might someone consider the noises made by a carpenter’s tools to be a

kind of music? Give a reason for your answer.


» Answers will vary, but students might speak of the rhythm of hammering, the

various pitches of tools, or other details.


5. Based on the way Whitman compares the work and the songs, what do you

think he would consider the most important trait about America? Give a

reason from the poem to support your answer.


» Answers will vary, though a reasonable response would explain that Whitman’s

focus on individual song shows how much he values that people are all different.


6. _Harmony_ is a musical term that describes how different notes work together

to create a pleasing sound. It also describes how people work together. How

does Whitman’s metaphor between singing and work use the two definitions

of _harmony_ ?


» Whitman uses the metaphor to show that it is people working together that make

America; a lot of individuals together create harmony.


 - Review answers aloud with students, taking volunteer answers as

time permits.


 - As a wrap-up, explain that Whitman’s poem shows that individual people with

different jobs can still work together in harmony.

Check for Understanding


Ask students to explain why the word _as_ in the second, third, and fourth
lines is not part of a simile.

» It is not used to compare. In these examples, it means “while.”

##### Writing


**Primary Focus:** Students compose original “I Hear My School Singing” poems,

using a number of different episodes throughout the school day to present a varied

portrait of their academic environment. ~~**[TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.11.A; TEKS 4.12.A ]**~~


~~**OBSERVATIONAL WALK/BRAINSTORMING (15 MIN.)**~~


**Introducing Activity Goals**


 - In the writing component of this lesson, students will compose original poems

that demonstrate the different ways they see or hear their school singing. This

activity helps students gather material to use in that poem.


 - Explain that in the remaining portion of this lesson, students will use Whitman’s

approach to compose their own poem titled “I Hear My School Singing.” The

first part of the writing process will help them generate ideas about all the ways

that people might metaphorically sing throughout the school day. Students are

expected to write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.


 - If you are taking students on the optional observational walk, review guidelines

with students. In addition to reviewing safety and behavioral guidelines, explain to

students that they will take an observational walk around the school. The goal of

this time is for students to pay attention and observe many different things that

people are doing throughout the school. When they come back to the classroom,

they will have approximately five minutes to write down the things they noticed.


 - If you are staying in the classroom for the brainstorming session, explain

that students should think about the school day and all the different kinds

of activities that happen throughout it. Allow students to volunteer ideas of

different ways that these activities could be like Whitman’s version of singing.


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.11.A** Plan a first draft by selecting a genre for a

Now you’ll use the evidence you gathered in the previous activity to help you

write a poem about how you hear your school singing. Use that evidence to

answer the following questions:


1. Whitman’s poem describes many different kinds of workers that help make

up America. What different kinds of workers help make up your school?


» Answers will vary, but they might include students, teachers, principals, guidance

counselors, safety officers, custodians, cafeteria workers, and others.


2. Whitman compares the work of Americans to songs. What kind of songs do

you hear in the school? For example, students’ feet as they enter the class

might make a drum-like sound.


» Answers will vary.


Using the material you listed above, compose your own poem on the following

lines. Make sure to write the title, “I Hear My School Singing,” on the very first

line. As you write, try to include at least ten different kinds of songs you hear in

the school day.


If you finish with time to spare, look back over your poem. Go back and add

at least one more detail that helps readers understand how your school sings

throughout the day.


 - If time permits, ask volunteers to read their poems aloud to the class.

~~**ABOUT THE POET**~~


**Walt Whitman**


Born on May 31, 1819, on Long Island, New York, Walt Whitman worked as a

teacher and a journalist before becoming a poet. His poetry related to people

of all backgrounds and made him one of America’s most well-known and

beloved writers.


During Whitman’s time, the civil war split the United States in two. The war

inspired him to write _Drum Taps_, poetry about the war and his experiences as

a battlefield nurse. His writing was powerful; even President Lincoln admired

him. In fact, one of his poems, “O Captain, My Captain,” is a patriotic tribute to

President Lincoln.


Whitman also wrote poems about nature. Whitman died in 1892. However,

his poetry and free-verse style, along with his conversational tone, remain

appreciated and admired.

Lesson 5 “The Delight Song of Tsoai-talee” (Lesson 1 of 2)
**67**


**68**



**Why We Selected It**


N. Scott Momaday’s “The Delight Song of Tsoai-talee” is a poem that invites

the reader to think about what it means to be alive while making connections

to nature through metaphor. In addition to the vivid use of metaphor by

the poet, the poem utilizes anaphora as a structural poetic device. The

predictability of anaphora as a poetic device takes away cognitive load in

the reading, so that students can more readily focus on the analysis of the

metaphors, which hinge upon both living and nonliving components. The poem

highlights the poet’s identity as a member of the Kiowa tribe with references

to Tsen-tainte, a Kiowa chief. Tsoai-talee, meaning “rock tree boy,” was a name

given to the poet as an infant by his tribe.


Pronunciation Guidance: Tsoai-talee: pronounced [ts’oh-igh-tahl-yee] (The ts’

makes a sharp /z/ sound) Tsen-tainte: pronounced [tsayn-t’ighn-day] (The

second t makes an emphasized /t/ sound) _It is an important cultural note that_

_there have been multiple iterations of Kiowa vocabulary which attempt to turn_

_the tonal sounds into a phonetic alphabet. The pronunciations written above_

_are the closest to the Kiowa pronunciation. For additional cultural context,_

_in the Kiowa written language, the words are written as follows: Tsêñt’àiñ:dè_

_[tsayñ-t’ighñ-day], Ts’òâitàlyì: [ts’oh-igh-tahl-yee]_


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Speaking and Listening**

- Prepare the Speaking and Listening Observational Checklist.


- Prepare to assign each student a line or phrase from the poem. You may wish

to photocopy the poem, number its lines, then cut them apart. Each student

may then read their line in sequential order.


**Reading**

- The poem “The Delight Song of Tsoai-talee” can be found in the Anthology.


- Prepare to organize students into at least five groups. If your class size necessitates

more than five groups, assign one metaphor to more than one group.


- Prepare to assign metaphors to each group.

##### Speaking and Listening [25][m]


**Primary Focus:** Students will read N. Scott Momaday’s “The Delight Song of

Tsoai-talee,” following their assigned roles when speaking in and to groups.


~~**TEKS 4.1.D**~~


~~**READ-ALOUD (25 MIN.)**~~


**Introduce the Poem**


 - Ask a student to volunteer to review the class discussion and work on Walt

Whitman’s poem “I Hear America Singing.”


» Answers may vary slightly as students focus on different aspects of the poem,

but they should remember that it involved Whitman describing the United States

through the “songs” of its workers.


**TEKS 4.1.D** Work collaboratively with others to develop a plan of shared responsibilities.


Lesson 5 “The Delight Song of Tsoai-talee” (Lesson 1 of 2)
**69**


**70**




 - Explain to students that, although Whitman’s poem uses the idea of song

as a metaphor for different kinds of work, poetry and music do have things

in common.


 - Tell students that the poet in this lesson, N. Scott Momaday, uses a rhythmic,

repetitive pattern inspired by Kiowa chants and songs. Momaday is a descendant

and member of the Kiowa tribe.


1. **Literal.** Ask students what they notice about the title of the poem.


» Answers may vary, but students should notice the poet’s use of the word _song_ in

the title.


 - Explain that Tsoai-talee, which means “rock tree boy” or “one who lives with

nature,” is a Kiowa name that Momaday was given as an infant.


 - **Evaluative.** Based on this discussion of the title, ask students whose point of view

they think this poem is from.


» Answers may vary but students should understand that this poem is likened to a

song of delight from the poet’s point of view.


 - Explain that while Kiowa chants and songs can take many different forms, they

often include repetition. Tell students that as they listen to the poem, they should

pay attention to repeated words or phrases.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to review some of the reasons a poet might use repetition.


**Read the Poem**


 - Read the poem aloud to students.

1. **Literal.** What phrases were repeated in this poem?


» Answers may vary but students may point out the phrases _I am, I stand in good_

_relation,_ or _I am alive._


 - Students need not notice every variation; for now, it is sufficient for them to

notice the general trend of phrases repeated with some variations.


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


**Class Reading**


 - Explain that in many Kiowa traditions, songs and chants were not written down

but kept alive through being retold to new generations. Tell the class that they

will now read the poem “The Delight Song of Tsoai-talee” aloud together as a

class to practice this.


**Note:** If your students are not accustomed to reading in unison, you might

wish to pause briefly after each section to help with pacing.


2. **Inferential.** How does the poem change when everyone reads it aloud

together?


» Answers will vary, though students may note that when reading aloud, they

need to be aware of the pace of other speakers, which helps create a sense of

community. They may also notice that reading the poem together causes them to

attend to the rhythm of the poem.


**Reading in Turns**


 - Tell students that you all will experiment with one more way of reading the

poem. This time, instead of everyone reading each line, every person will read

aloud a line or phrase independently.

 - Assign each student a line or phrase of the poem and review best practices for

speaking clearly to a group.


3. **Evaluative.** What are some tips to keep in mind for how to read poetry aloud?


» Answers will vary, but students should be reading slowly and clearly, making sure

that they are speaking loudly enough for all to hear, and using an appropriate tone.

 - Read the entire poem in order, allowing each student to speak their

part individually.

 - Use the Speaking and Listening Observational Checklist to evaluate

student participation.

 - Extension: If time permits, you may allow students to collaborate in small

groups to choose lines or phrases of the poem to recite creatively. For

example, students may opt to read some lines through a choral reading and

some lines with one reader, or vary the tempo or tone of their reading, etc.

##### Reading


**Primary Focus:** Students will define _anaphora_ and _metaphor_, identify them in the poem,

and explain the meaning of examples of figurative language in the poem.


~~**READING FOR ANAPHORA (30 MIN.)**~~


**Anaphora**


Direct students to the poem’s first stanza. Ask students what they notice

about the language used in the first stanza. Answers may vary, but students

should notice that each line contains the phrase _I am_ .

 - Have them underline the phrase _I am_ each time it appears in the first stanza of

the poem.


1. **Literal.** Count the number of times the phrase appears in the first stanza.


» The phrase appears eighteen times in the first stanza.


2. **Literal.** Where in each line does the phrase appear in the first stanza?


» It appears at the beginning of each of the eighteen lines in the first stanza.


 - Ask students to continue underlining the phrase throughout the poem.


3. **Inferential** Ask students why they think the poet uses this phrase at the

beginning of each line.


» Answers will vary but may include that the repetition adds a rhythm, it brings the

poem structure, or it adds emphasis to certain words and helps to show which

words have importance.


4. **Evaluative.** Ask students where they have heard this type of repetition used

at the beginning of lines and consecutively in writing.


» Answers will vary but may include songs or speeches that students have heard.


 - Tell students that this is a device that we sometimes also hear in poetry.


 - Explain that when a poet repeats a word or phrase at the start of consecutive

lines, that poet is using a poetic device called anaphora.


 - Ask students to read the second stanza to themselves and continue

underlining examples of anaphora that they find.


5. **Literal.** What are the examples of anaphora in the second stanza?


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.9.B** Explain figurative language such as simile,
metaphor, and personification that the poet uses to create images.


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


» Students should have the phrase _I stand in good relation_ _to_ underlined in the

second stanza.


6. **Evaluative.** Is the phrase _You see, I am alive_ an example of anaphora?

Explain your answer.


» Students should be able to tell you that this phrase is an example of repetition but

not anaphora, since it is not on consecutive lines in the poem.


 - Explain that the effects of repetition are similar to the effects of anaphora,

which is specifically the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of

consecutive lines. However, because the words are repeated in the same

place—at the start of each line—anaphora also adds structure to the poem.

This kind of repetition can make a poem resemble a song or chant.


~~**READING FOR METAPHOR (35 MIN.)**~~


**Metaphor**


Check for Understanding


Ask a student to review the definition of _metaphor_ .

» A metaphor compares two different things without using the word

_like_ or _as_ .


 - Direct students to Poet’s Journal 5.1. Review the instructions and model

the first two examples. Students are expected to write legibly in cursive to

complete assignments.


 - Arrange the class into small groups and give each group one of the lettered

metaphors from the first stanza (listed below). Tell students that there

is no one way to interpret these metaphors. Students may have different

interpretations of each metaphor, but they should use the features of the

poem you have been discussing to interpret their metaphor’s meaning.


**Poet’s Journal 5.1**


**Interpreting Metaphor**


In “The Delight Song of Tsoai-talee,” N. Scott Momaday uses a first-person

point of view to compare the speaker’s life to various elements of the natural

world. Nature occupies a special space in many Kiowa communities. The

comparisons the speaker makes are in the form of metaphors.



Challenge


Where have you heard
anaphora before?


» Answers will vary, but
students might cite
religious ceremonies or
sermons, speeches such
as Martin Luther King Jr.’s
repeated refrain “I have a
dream,” or song lyrics.


Poet’s Journal 5.1



Lesson 5 “The Delight Song of Tsoai-talee” (Lesson 1 of 2)
**73**


**74**



Interpret the meaning of the metaphor you are assigned. Your teacher will

review an example before you start.


Example. Line 1


» Metaphor: I am a feather on the bright sky. Here, the speaker is comparing himself to

the natural element of a feather in the sky. A possible interpretation of the metaphor

could be that the speaker’s life is being likened to a bird flying in the sky. Both the

speaker and the bird are alive and moving through space freely and with ease.


More lines from the first stanza are listed below. Circle the letter of the line

your teacher assigns your group. Then work together as a group to fill out the

graphic organizer for your metaphor.


**Metaphors:**


A. Line 2


» Student answers will vary, but a possibility includes that this metaphor could be

comparing the speaker to blue wildflowers that often grow in the plains regions

and the horses running through the fields of flowers on the plains. This could be

a metaphor for freedom that is represented in flowers growing wildly across the

plain and horses running freely.


B. Line 3


» Student answers will vary, but a possibility includes the rolling fish is one that has

a duller appearance when removed from the water. In the water, the fish is slippery

and shining.


C. Line 4


» Student answers will vary, but a possibility includes that this could be a metaphor

comparing the shadow to a child’s companion that is always following along. This

metaphor could be likening the speaker to a familiar and constant friend. In this

line, nature is still implied, as light is needed for a shadow to appear.


D. Line 5


» Student answers will vary, but a possibility includes that this metaphor could

compare the speaker to the moon, which is the light in nature that is still seen in

the evening.


E. Line 6


» Student answers will vary, but a possibility includes that this could be a metaphor

comparing the eagle’s flight to the speaker’s own enjoyment found in life. The

eagle is a massive bird that could be intimidating, but this metaphor depicts the

eagle experiencing joy from flight.


F. Line 7


» Student answers will vary, but a possibility includes that this could be the beads of


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


dew that cluster on leaves and blades of grass, often reflecting the morning sun.

Like these beads, the speaker feels a connection to nature.


G. Line 8


» Student answers will vary, but a possibility includes that this could be a metaphor

for how present and deep the speaker’s connection is to nature and life. The

farthest star cannot be seen when one looks into the sky, but it is still an important

part of the universe.


Write your metaphor on the line below:


I am _________________________________________________.


As you work on interpreting the metaphor, you must think like poets, which

means thinking very creatively and using your imagination to decide what

Momaday might have meant.

**Why We Selected It**


N. Scott Momaday’s “The Delight Song of Tsoai-talee” is a poem that invites

the reader to think about what it means to be alive while making connections

to nature through metaphor. In addition to the vivid use of metaphor by

the poet, the poem utilizes anaphora as a structural poetic device. The

predictability of anaphora as a poetic device reduces the cognitive load in

the reading, so that students can more readily focus on the analysis of the

metaphors, which hinge upon both living and nonliving elements of nature.

The poem highlights the poet’s identity as a member of the Kiowa tribe with

references to Tsen-tainte, a Kiowa chief. Tsoai-talee, meaning “rock tree boy,”

was a name given to the poet as an infant by his tribe.

What did the metaphors in the first stanza have in common?

» Answers may vary, but students should remember that the

metaphors compare the speaker and his life to elements of nature.


- Explain that in the remaining lines of the first stanza, Momaday uses some of

the same organizational patterns.


- Explain to students that the first stanza is a way for the speaker to use

metaphor to express an appreciation for life, and the second stanza expresses

this appreciation for life concretely.


- Direct students to Poet’s Journal 6.1, review the instructions, and ask them to

complete the questions.


**Poet’s Journal 6.1**


**Figurative Language: Nature**


The first stanza of “The Delight of Tsoai-talee” includes various elements of

nature. The poet uses a first-person voice on each of the anaphoric lines in

the stanza to connect the speaker to the natural world. Since a person cannot

really be a feather, meadow, blue horse, star, etc., we know that Momaday

must be using figurative language. The poet is also reminding readers that

natural elements and human life are connected.


In the previous lesson, you analyzed the metaphors in lines 1–8. The remaining

lines in the first stanza include metaphors, almost all of which are connected

to nature.


Use your best interpreting skills to decide what the figurative language in this

stanza might mean. You may refer to the poem as you work.


Your teacher will practice this with the ninth line of the stanza 1.

seventeenth lines of stanza 1?


Line 16


» Student answers will vary, but a possibility includes that the speaker’s life is being

Line 17


» Student answers will vary, but a possibility includes that the speaker’s life is being

compared here again to a more vivid description of survival, as even the young

wolf must hunt to survive.


 - Ask volunteers to share answers aloud.


 - Have students read line 18 of the first stanza and volunteer to interpret

the line.


» Student answers will vary, but a possibility includes the speaker is using the

metaphor of “the whole dream” to express a desire to be the best version of all

that nature and humanity has to offer.


 - Ask students to read the second stanza silently.


1. **Literal.** What do you notice about the structure of the second stanza?


» The poet uses repetition in the first and last line for added emphasis of the theme.

Anaphora is used in the middle lines, which all begin with “I stand in good relation

to.”


2. **Evaluative.** What is the connection between the metaphors used in the first

eight lines and the repetitive lines or anaphora lines in the second stanza?


» In the first stanza, the speaker uses metaphors about nature to express how

they feel about being alive. The stanzas work together to emphasize a theme of

connection with the natural world.


3. **Evaluative.** In the second stanza, why might the speaker be using the phrase

_I stand in good relation to_ as anaphora in this final stanza?


» Answers may vary but may include it is to show the importance of mutual respect

as one way of living in a community.

**Primary Focus:** Students will plan original poems that use metaphor and anaphora.


~~**TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.11.A; TEKS 4.12.A**~~


~~**PLANNING ANAPHORA POEMS (25 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that now they will work on their own anaphora poems that

contain metaphor, using Momaday’s poem as a model for their writing.


 - Ask whether Momaday’s poem is in first- or third-person point of view.


» The poem is in first-person.


 - Revisit Momaday’s poem as needed to discuss the poet’s use of metaphor

and anaphora. Explain that the students will be writing their own poems in

first-person point of view, using anaphora by starting each line with the phrase

_I am_ .


 - Direct students to Poet’s Journal 6.2. Review the instructions and tell students

to complete steps 1 and 2, which appear in the Planning section.


 - Allow students to share their answers to questions 1 and 2 with a partner

before asking them to move on to steps 3–6, which appear in the Organizing

section of Poet’s Journal 6.2.


 - Allow volunteers to share their answers with a partner.


**Poet’s Journal 6.2**


**Planning Anaphora Poems**


**Planning**


In writing, it is important to think about what you want to accomplish before

you begin. This exercise will help you do that. You will write one stanza during

this lesson. You may choose to continue adding to this poem on your own.

First consider what you are going to write: a poem that uses anaphora to

describe different aspects of your own personality.


Think about how Momaday does this: He uses nature and the environment as

representatives of what it means to be alive.


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.11.A** Plan a first draft by selecting a genre for a
particular topic, purpose, and audience using a range of strategies such as brainstorming, freewriting, and mapping;
**TEKS 4.12.A** Compose literary texts such as personal narratives and poetry using genre characteristics and craft.


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


1. Think about your own life and the things that are most important to you. What

elements of nature will you use as a metaphor to represent different parts of

your life or identity in the lines of your anaphora poem?


Check for Understanding


Ask students to name an element of nature that could represent them and
to explain their reasons for choosing this particular thing.


2. Think about the way Momaday uses anaphora. Start each line of your poem

by saying “I am ____.”


**Organizing**


Now that you have an idea of how you will include anaphora, you need to

develop ideas about how to organize the different characteristics. In this

exercise, you’ll use natural elements just as Momaday did. Think about how

you can use ideas that describe your personality, what you do, and how you

feel as a strategy for drafting your poem. Follow the prompts below to list the

parts of your life or identity that you will write about in the poem.


3. Momaday’s first stanza uses elements of nature. List at least two features

of nature that are metaphors for your personality. For example, if you are

stubborn, you might describe yourself as a boulder or mountains, because

these are not easily moved.


4. Momaday’s first stanza describes actions in the natural world. List at least

two actions you see in nature that describe what you do. Like Momaday, you

may use figurative language here. For example, if you are someone who is

always moving, you might write “I am the crashing of waves.”


5. Momaday and other poets often use feelings to guide their metaphors.

Think of an element of nature that represents your feelings. For example, if you

are often joyful, you might write “I am the rainbow after it storms.”


If you finish this section with time remaining, go back and try to add two

more nature metaphors to each of your lists. For example, for question 3, you

would add two more nature metaphors for your personality; for question 4,

you would add two more nature metaphors for what you do; and for question

5, you would add two more nature metaphors for how you feel. All of these

should be representative of your life, personality, or identity.

Lesson 7 “Words Free as Confetti”
**89**


**90**



**Why We Selected It**


Pat Mora’s “Words Free as Confetti” celebrates words—their diversity, their

color, and their ability to liberate their speakers. The poem’s narrator dances

through sound, using English and Spanish words to highlight the variation

of language and delighting in the way words appear tactile. Included in

the appendix B text list, this poem offers appropriate rigor for students

approaching the end of the poetry unit; more importantly, it presents the

poet’s genuine delight in language and its possibilities.


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Reading**


 - The poem “Words Free as Confetti” can be found in the Anthology.

**Universal Access**


 - Prepare definitions of terms and illustrations of events described in the

poem’s similes.

 - Gather objects for students to use as inspiration in the writing activity.

 - Prepare a word bank and sentence frames for the writing activity.

Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


~~**READ-ALOUD (20 MIN.)**~~


**Introduce Reading**


 - Tell students that this lesson presents a poem titled “Words Free as Confetti.”

 - Ask students to define _confetti_ and state where it is typically used.


» Confetti, small pieces of colorful paper, is usually tossed or dropped for celebrations

such as New Year’s Eve, sports championships, and other festive events.


1. **Evaluative.** Listen to the poem’s title again: “Words Free as Confetti.” What

literary device is Mora using in the title, and what word helps you identify it?


» The word _as_ indicates that the title is a simile.


 - Ask a student volunteer to review the definition of _simile_ .


2. **Literal.** What two things are being compared in the title?


» words and confetti


3. **Literal.** According to the title, how are words and confetti alike?


» Both are free.


 - Tell students that the word _free_ has several definitions— _without cost, without_

_limits, able to move around without barriers or rules_ —and that they will have to

pay close attention to the poem to decide which definition or definitions Mora

uses here. Tell students that as they listen to the poem aloud, they should pay

attention for repeated words or phrases.


4. **Inferential.** Mora compares words to confetti, which is usually used for

celebrations. Based on that, what kind of feelings do you think Mora has

about words?


» Answers will vary, but students should recognize that Mora has a positive feeling

toward words.


 - Direct students to the poem. They may follow along silently as you read the

poem aloud.


 - Read the poem.


 - Students may notice the unusual compounding of several words. Remind

students that this is not the standard way of presenting words, but it is an

example of poetic license, or using a format to help make your point. You may

wish to prompt students to speculate on why Mora made this choice; perhaps

she wished to draw attention to these particular words, or she wanted to show

the connection between each component of the pair, or she wanted to show

that her freedom extends to language.



Note to Student


Pat Mora is bilingual, which
means that she speaks
two languages: in her case
English and Spanish. This
poem uses the following
Spanish words:


_abuelita–_ grandmother


_gatitos–_ kittens


_yo soy libre–_ I am free



Lesson 7 “Words Free as Confetti”

Challenge


Tell students that
alliteration is commonly
used in song lyrics,
jump rope chants,
advertisements, and
commercials. Ask why
alliteration would be used
in these sources.


Poet’s Journal 7.1


**92**



~~**POETIC DEVICE: ALLITERATION (20 MIN.)**~~


**Review Alliteration**


- Ask a student volunteer to review the definition of _alliteration_ .


» Alliteration is the repetition of letters at the beginning of several words that

appear in order or near one another.


Check for Understanding


Name an example of alliteration in the first six lines of this poem.

» The poem contains two examples of alliteration: one in line 4 and

one in line 6.


- Explain that line 4 is an excellent example of alliteration, as the words share

four opening letters: _p, l, u_, and _m_ . Remind students that alliteration can occur

even if the words share fewer letters.


**Practicing Alliteration**


- Direct students to Poet’s Journal 7.1. Review the instructions and ask them to

complete numbers 1–5.


**Poet’s Journal 7.1**


**Alliteration**


In this exercise you’ll practice your alliteration skills. In an earlier lesson you

used alliteration to describe the way an animal might feel. In this lesson you’ll

write new examples of alliteration that link to your own name.


Write a letter from your name on each of the five lines on the next page. Only

use each letter one time. If you run out of letters from your first name, move

on to your last name. For example, if your name were Sid Sawyer, you would

write the following letters on the lines: _S, I, D, A, W._


After you put a letter on each line, write a sentence using each letter. Each

sentence should have at least three words that start with the letter from

your name.


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


Examples:


Letter: _S_


Sid spied swans.


Letter: _W_


Wally watched walruses.


1.


2.


3.


4.


5.


If you finish with time remaining, try to add two more words to each sentence

using alliteration.


Examples:


Letter: _S_


Sid spied swans swimming silently.


Letter: _W_


Wally watched walruses waiting in the water.


 - If time permits, allow each student to share their sentences aloud with

a partner.

~~**READING (25 MIN.)**~~


**Similes**


- Direct students to the chart in Poet’s Journal 7.2. Review the directions and

example, then ask students to complete the chart. They may consult the poem

as they work.


**Poet’s Journal 7.2**


**Interpreting Similes**


Explain that, in addition to alliteration, Mora uses many similes throughout

her poem. In fact, she includes sixteen different similes! Then walk students

through filling out the first row of the chart as an example.


The chart below lists lines from in Mora’s poem. Each line contains a simile

that has to do with one of the five senses: smell, touch, sight, sound, and

taste. For each line, write down the simile and the sense it corresponds to.

Then think about what each simile might say about words, and complete the

possible figurative meaning of the simile.


Your teacher will fill out the first row of the chart with you as an example.


» Answers may vary, but likely possibilities are provided below.











|Line|Simile|Sense<br>(you may have more<br>than one sense)|Figurative meaning:<br>how this applies to words|
|---|---|---|---|
|Line 4|sweet as<br>plump plums|_taste_|_words can be sweet or pleasant_<br>_to your mouth; they can be fun_<br>_to say_|
|Line 5||_taste/smell_|_words can be unpleasant in your_<br>_mouth; they can be harsh to_<br>_say; Mora also mentions sniffng_<br>_words here; the smell of lemons_<br>_is somewhat sharp and crisp,_<br>_but old lemons might be less_<br>_appealing_|

 - Review answers for each simile, allowing students to volunteer their ideas if

time permits.


1. **Evaluative.** We usually think of words as something you hear or see, not

something you taste, touch, or smell. However, Mora uses all five senses to

describe words. What effect do her descriptions have?


» Answers will vary, though many students feel the descriptions present a more full

picture of words.

2. **Inferential.** Mora’s title says that words are free. But at the end of the poem,

she writes about her own freedom. How might words make her feel free?


» Answers will vary, but students should recognize that words, with their many

different qualities, can open up a lot of possibilities. People who know how to use

words effectively gain a kind of freedom.


3. **Evaluative.** Mora uses personification in this poem. Can you find an

example? What image does this create?


» “I’ll watch you, words, rise and dance and spin.”


» Answers may vary, but can include that the freedom and joy that humans feel

when dancing is like the freedom that comes from using words well.

**Writing with All Five Senses**


Now it’s your turn to write using all five senses and alliteration! In this activity

you will follow Mora’s example and write a poem about something that is

extremely important to you. Follow the instructions below to plan, organize,

and draft your poem.


1. Mora writes about words because she values them. In this poem you will

write about something that is very important to you. Take a minute to think

about an object that you value. It may not be something you actually own,

but it should be something you know well enough to describe in a lot of

different ways. When you have decided on the object you will write about,

write it below.


2. Mora’s poem uses all five senses to describe words. You will do the same

thing in your poem. For each letter below, describe how the sense listed

applies to your object. Depending on the object you selected, you may not

be able to give a literal meaning for each sense. For example, if you selected

a favorite rock to write about, you have probably never tasted it! But think

about how Mora uses similes to introduce a figurative meaning into her

descriptions. Try to do the same with your object.


a. What does it feel like when you touch it?


b. What does it smell like?


c. How does it sound?


d. What does it look like?


e. What does it taste like?


3. Mora describes how she feels free, like words. How does your object make

you feel?


4. Describe a way that you are like your object.


5. Now pick one of your answers from above and think about a way to describe

it using alliteration. Write that here.

Students can find
examples of alliteration
and sensory details in
magazines, newspaper

~~**ABOUT THE POET**~~


**Pat Mora**


Pat Mora is a Latina poet and author. Born in El Paso, Texas in 1942 on the

Mexico-US border, she grew up speaking English and Spanish at home. Her

love of poetry started early: “I always liked poetry, and I had lots of books in

my house, so I would just open them up and read.”


Mora became a teacher, a university administrator, and a writer. She is

inspired by her culture and childhood: “Many of my book ideas come from

the desert where I grew up in the open spaces, wide sky, [and] all that sun.”

Mora supports bilingual literacy programs. She is deeply involved in spreading

“bookjoy”—exciting children to read at a young age. Her books _Tomas_

_and the Library Lady_, _The Rainbow Tulip_, and _House of Houses_ capture the

imaginations of young readers. She currently lives and writes in Santa Fe,

New Mexico.

**101**


**102**



**Why We Selected It**


Sandburg’s “Fog” is a classic twentieth-century American poem. The extended

metaphor renders the fog vividly and descriptively, adding nuance and depth

to the poem’s imagery. Sandburg’s work presents no human characters,

but by endowing the fog with agency and consciousness, it brings the

commonplace weather phenomenon to life and demonstrates the imaginative

possibilities of figurative language.

##### Reading


**Primary Focus:** Students identify an extended metaphor and explain its various

details. ~~**TEKS 4.6.F; TEKS 4.6.G; TEKS 4.10.D**~~


~~**READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


**Introduce the Reading**


 - Ask a student volunteer to review the definition of metaphor.


 - Ask students why poets use metaphors.



»



Answers will vary, but you might encourage students to draw on past examples.

For example, Pat Mora’s “Words Like Confetti” uses metaphor to describe her

relationships to different words.




 - You may wish to point out that so far, most of the poems in these lessons

have told stories about characters, such as the boys playing basketball or the

student visiting the library. But poems can do more than tell stories about

people. They can also show a scene or present a picture of nature.


 - Tell students that this lesson presents a poem titled “Fog.” In this poem, the

poet, Carl Sandburg, uses a metaphor to describe the weather. Tell students

that as they listen to the poem they should pay attention and try to identify

the metaphor Sandburg uses.


 - Read “Fog.”


**TEKS 4.6.F** Make inferences and use evidence to support understanding; **TEKS 4.6.G** Evaluate details read to determine key
ideas; **TEKS 4.10.D** Describe how the author’s use of imagery, literal and figurative language such as simile and metaphor,

**Fog**


**Carl Sandburg**


The fog comes


on little cat feet.


It sits looking


over harbor and city


on silent haunches


and then moves on.


~~**EXTENDED METAPHOR (35 MIN.)**~~


**Introducing Poetic Devices: Extended Metaphor**


1. **Inferential.** Based on the poem’s first stanza, what two things does this

poem compare?


» It compares the fog to a cat.


 - Students may answer that the poem compares the fog to cat’s feet. If so, ask

them to look more closely at the first stanza, which says that the fog “comes

on” the cat feet. In other words, the fog moves as if it has cat’s feet; it is not

compared to the feet themselves.


2. **Literal.** How do cats move?


» Answers will vary, though they should recognize that cats are generally considered

light on their feet. They walk softly and quietly.


 - If students reference big cats such as lions and tigers, direct them back to the

poem, which references “ _little_ cat feet” (emphasis added).


3. **Literal.** How do elephants move?


» Answers will vary but should reflect that elephants are louder and more

lumbering. The ground might shake when they pass by.


4. **Literal.** How do kangaroos move?


» Answers will vary but should reflect hopping.


5. **Literal.** How do butterflies move?


» Answers will vary but should reflect flight and flapping wings.


 - Remind students that many different animals exist, and that by comparing the


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


fog to a cat, Sandburg chose to emphasize certain things about the fog. The

next activity will help demonstrate this.


- Direct students to Poet’s Journal 8.1.


- Review the instructions and model the first example. Explain that when

Sandburg writes that the fog “comes on little cat feet,” he is describing how

the fog moves through the city. To think about what he means, readers should

consider how a cat moves. Unlike an animal such as an elephant, most cats

walk lightly and quietly, so write those words under “How this might describe

a cat.” Explain that one way Sandburg might be using those words to make a

comparison to fog is by suggesting that the fog forms quietly, unlike weather

such as a thunderstorm. Write that description under “How this might

describe fog.”


- Arrange students into small groups and have them complete the chart.


**Poet’s Journal 8.1**


**Extended Metaphor**


When a writer’s metaphor continues for more than one sentence of a story or

more than one line of a poem, it is called an extended metaphor.


Carl Sandburg’s poem “Fog” uses an extended metaphor to compare the fog

to a cat. Using the poem as a reference, complete the following chart to show

the different parts of Sandburg’s extended metaphor.



Poet’s Journal 8.1









|Words from poem|How this might<br>describe a cat|How this might describe fog|

- Discuss group answers with the class.





6. **Evaluative.** What kind of scene does Sandburg’s metaphor build in this

poem? Give a reason to explain your answer.

5. Once you have listed three ways in which the animal compares to the

weather, use the following lines to compose your poem.


If you finish with time remaining, look back over your work to make sure your

metaphor extends for more than one line of the poem. Then think of one more

way you could compare the animal to the weather, and add that to your poem.

~~**ABOUT THE POET**~~


**Carl Sandburg**


Carl Sandburg was born January 6, 1878, in Galesburg, Illinois. Sandburg’s

family was desperately poor, so he left school at age thirteen, doing odd jobs

to earn money for the family. While serving in the Spanish-American War years

later, he met a student from Lombard College who persuaded Sandburg to

return to school after the war.


At Lombard College, Sandburg was mentored by a writing professor who

encouraged him to pursue poetry and supported him in publishing his

first collection of poems, _Reckless Ecstasy_ . Sandburg wrote in free verse

inspired by the poetry of Walt Whitman. While living in Chicago as an adult,

he published several volumes of poetry, including _Chicago Poems_ and

_Cornhuskers_ . He became famous for his depictions of urban life and the

industrial city. He won the Pulitzer Prize three times, once for his biography of

President Lincoln and twice for poetry. Sandburg died in 1967.

~~**GROUP LISTENING (30 MIN.)**~~


**Listening to “Casey at the Bat”**


**Note:** Ernest Lawrence Thayer’s poem “Casey at the Bat” is an extremely

long text, so this lesson uses a listening exercise to introduce it.


 - Explain to students that poets have many tools available for explaining their

message. Sandburg decided to use one primary tool, the extended metaphor,

throughout his poem. However, other poets use a number of different kinds of

tools, including rhyme and figurative language, to describe their subjects.


 - Tell students that this lesson and the following lesson look at a very different

kind of poem. This poem, titled “Casey at the Bat,” is a long narrative poem

that uses many different examples of figurative language to tell the story of

Casey, its title character.


    - Remind students that careful readers believe it is important to experience

a poem in different ways a number of times. Today, students will start by

listening to the poem.


 - Remind students that they should not be worried if they do not understand

everything about the poem the first time they hear it. While they listen, they

should pay attention to what things they notice about the poem. They might

listen for rhyming words, descriptions that help them imagine the setting of

the poem, or words that help them understand what story the poem is telling.


 - Read the poem.

Lesson 9 “Casey at the Bat”
**113**


**114**



And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,


A sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game.


A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest


Clung to the hope which springs eternal in the human breast;


They thought, “If only Casey could but get a whack at that—


We’d put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.”


But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,


And the former was a hoodoo, while the latter was a cake;


So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,


For there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.


But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,


And Blake, the much despisèd, tore the cover off the ball;


And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,


There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.


Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;


It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;


It pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,


For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.


There was ease in Casey’s manner as he stepped into his place;


There was pride in Casey’s bearing and a smile lit Casey’s face.


And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,


No stranger in the crowd could doubt ’twas Casey at the bat.


Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;


Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt;


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,


Defiance flashed in Casey’s eye, a sneer curled Casey’s lip.


And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,


And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.


Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped—


“That ain’t my style,” said Casey. “Strike one!” the umpire said.


From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,


Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore;


“Kill him! Kill the umpire!” shouted someone on the stand;


And it’s likely they’d have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.


With a smile of Christian charity great Casey’s visage shone;


He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;


He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the dun sphere flew;


But Casey still ignored it and the umpire said, “Strike two!”


“Fraud!” cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered “Fraud!”


But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.


They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,


And they knew that Casey wouldn’t let that ball go by again.


The sneer is gone from Casey’s lip, his teeth are clenched in hate,


He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate;


And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,


And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey’s blow.


Oh, somewhere in this favoured land the sun is shining bright,


The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;

~~**READING FOR UNDERSTANDING (35 MIN.)**~~


**Introduce Reading by Stanza**


 - Explain that students will now work in groups to focus on a specific stanza.

Then each group will share its summary of what happens in the stanza, and

together the class will have summarized the poem.


 - Remind students that they may not know every word that the poem uses. They

may check their glossary, but they should also practice using context to draw

a reasonable conclusion about an unfamiliar word’s meaning.


 - Explain that because the meanings of words change over time, sometimes

even words that seem familiar may not mean what we expect. An example is

when the poem describes Jimmy Blake as “a cake.” Reading that today, we

might think he is dessert, but we know that doesn’t make any sense.


 - In the author’s time, the word _cake_ could mean dessert, but it was also

sometimes used to describe a silly or foolish person. So when Thayer calls

Jimmy Blake a cake, he is saying that the fans did not think he would help the

Mudville baseball team win its game. Even if you didn’t know the nineteenth
century meaning of the word _cake_, though, you could probably make an

inference from the context that the fans did not have much confidence in Jimmy.


 - Direct students to stanza 1. Read the stanza aloud.


The outlook wasn’t brilliant for the Mudville nine that day:


The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,


And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,

 - Explain that even though students may not know the precise meaning of

everything in the stanza, they can use context clues to figure it out. Go line by

line through the stanza.

Lesson 9 “Casey at the Bat”
**117**


Poet’s Journal 9.2




 - If students have demonstrated comfort with the poem so far, you may wish to

ask volunteers to summarize each line. Otherwise, model how to summarize

each line using stanza 1 as an example.


   - Line 1: The Mudville baseball team was not playing well.


   - Line 2: Mudville was losing by two runs, and the game was almost over.


   - Line 3: We don’t yet know who Cooney and Barrows are, but we can infer

that they are players on the Mudville team. Here, Thayer uses “died” as an

exaggerated way of saying that a player was called out at first base. This

kind of exaggeration is called _hyperbole_ . We use hyperbole in expressions

such as, “We’re starving!” or, “We’ve been waiting forever!” These

statements do not literally mean that we are dying of hunger or that we

have been waiting forever; they mean that we are very hungry or that we

have waited a long time.


   - Line 4: As players strike out, the fans get very quiet. We can infer that they

are distressed by the team’s performance.


**Group Focus on Individual Stanzas**


 - Tell students that they will now work in groups to figure out the meaning of the

remaining stanzas.


 - Assign groups for stanzas 2–13, direct students to Poet’s Journal 9.2, review

the instructions, and ask students to complete the activity.


 - As groups work, circulate and check in with students.


**Poet’s Journal 9.2**


**Summarizing a Stanza**


Working with the group your teacher assigned, follow these steps to figure out

the meaning of your stanza.


1. Read the stanza silently.


2. Have one member of the group read the stanza aloud.


3. If the stanza has any words you do not know, ask your group members for

help. You might look in the glossary to see if the word is defined. If not, work

together as a group to think about how context clues can help you infer the

word’s meaning.


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words



**118**


4. Go through each of the stanza’s four lines and talk about what they mean.


5. Once you agree on a meaning for each line, summarize those into the action

of the stanza. Remember that in a summary, you should describe the most

important things happening. You should not include every detail, but you

should give readers a sense of the basic points of the section.


6. When you have agreed on a summary, write it here.


7. Pick one group representative to share the summary with the class when the

teacher calls on your group.


**Sharing Meanings**


 - Review the answers by calling out the number of each stanza. When a group’s

stanza is called, the representative of the group will read the group’s summary.


 - Example summaries of each stanza follow; they are numbered by stanza.


    - Stanza 1: The Mudville baseball team was losing by two as the game

approached the end. Two players struck out, and the fans got quiet.


    - Stanza 2: Some fans left. The others stayed, hopeful that the team could

win if Casey had a chance to bat.


    - Stanza 3: The two players in front of Casey were not very good, so the fans

worried that Casey would not get the chance to bat.


    - Stanza 4: Flynn and Blake both got hits and got on base.


    - Stanza 5: Fans cheered as they realized that Casey was going to get a

chance to bat.


    - Stanza 6: Casey was confident as he came to the plate; he waved at

cheering fans.


    - Stanza 7: Casey got ready to bat, looking fierce and tough.


    - Stanza 8: Casey did not swing at the first pitch, which was a strike.


    - Stanza 9: The fans got upset that the umpire called a strike.


    - Stanza 10: Casey calmed the fans down. He took another pitch and got

another strike.


    - Stanza 11: The fans were angry again, but again Casey calmed them down.

Casey finally seemed ready to hit the ball.

   - Stanza 12: Casey’s expression changed. The pitcher threw the ball, and

this time Casey swung.


   - Stanza 13: There are happy people elsewhere in the world; the sun is

shining, people laugh, play, and listen to music. But Mudville is not that

happy place, because Casey struck out.


 - Allow a few minutes for student questions; make sure students understand

the basic content of the poem prior to continuing to the next activity.


Check for Understanding


Ask groups to act out the stanzas. If students struggle, refer them back to
the text for review and support.


~~**READING FOR POETIC DEVICES (25 MIN.)**~~


**Working Independently**


 - Tell students that, now that they understand the story the poem tells, they will

look more closely at some of the specific poetic devices the poem uses.


 - Direct students to Poet’s Journal 9.3, review the instructions, and have

students complete the activity. Students are expected to write legibly in

cursive to complete assignments.


**Poet’s Journal 9.3**


**Poetic Devices**


Now it’s time to explore the way this poem uses poetic devices. To do this, you

will need to use things you learned from other lessons in the poetry unit. Think

back to the different kinds of poetic devices you have learned about so far.

Thayer uses a lot of them in his long poem!


Answer the following questions, consulting the poem as needed, to think more

about which devices he used and why he chose them.


1. In stanzas 1 and 2, the phrases “sickly silence” and “deep despair” are

examples of which poetic device?


» alliteration


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


2. This device often adds emphasis to certain details. Look back at the first

two stanzas of “Casey at the Bat.” Why might the “sickly silence” and “deep

despair” be important things to emphasize here?


» These details help show readers how the fans felt and how important the game

was to them.


3. Stanza 4 describes how Blake “tore the cover off the ball.” The poet uses

figurative language here; Blake did not really tear up the ball. What is the

figurative meaning of this statement?


» Blake hit the ball very hard.


4. In stanza 9, the poet writes:


. . . there went up a muffled roar,


Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore.


Read each word carefully. What poetic device is used here? Name the word

that helps you know this.


» This is a simile, as the word _like_ shows.


5. The lines in question 4 compare two different things. What are they?


» They compare a roar and storm-waves.


6. How are the two things compared by the lines in question 4 similar?


» They are both loud and aggressive.


7. Stanza 13 repeats the word “somewhere” many times. Circle the word every

time it appears in the stanza. How many times does it appear?


» five times


8. We know that poets often use repetition to focus on important details. Why

might the author of this poem want to focus on “somewhere” in this stanza?


» Answers may vary slightly, but the poet is emphasizing that the happy things are

not happening in Mudville but somewhere else.


 - Review the answers.


 - Remind students that poets have many tools, or poetic devices, they may use

in a poem. Part of being a good reader of poetry is doing what students just

did: identifying the tools poets use and thinking about the reasons they might

choose these tools to help get their meaning across in a certain way.


 - Tell students that they will spend more time on the poem in the following

lesson, but if they’d like, they may also review the poem again as a take-home.

**Introduce the Reading**


 - Tell students that this lesson continues with Ernest Lawrence Thayer’s poem

from the previous lesson.


Check for Understanding


Ask what students remember about Thayer’s poem.

» Students should remember that the poem’s main character, Casey,

strikes out in the big baseball game. If students recall little about

the poem, direct them to the poem’s title, using it to help them

infer who the poem is about (Casey) and what he is doing (batting

in a baseball game).


 - Read the poem aloud while students follow along silently.


**Casey at the Bat**


**Ernest Lawrence Thayer**


The outlook wasn’t brilliant for the Mudville nine that day:


The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,


And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,


A sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game.

Lesson 10 “Casey at the Bat” (Lesson 2 of 2)
**125**


**126**



A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest


Clung to the hope which springs eternal in the human breast;


They thought, “If only Casey could but get a whack at that—


We’d put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.”


But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,


And the former was a hoodoo, while the latter was a cake;


So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,


For there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.


But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,


And Blake, the much despisèd, tore the cover off the ball;


And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,


There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.


Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;


It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;


It pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,


For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.


There was ease in Casey’s manner as he stepped into his place;


There was pride in Casey’s bearing and a smile lit Casey’s face.


And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,


No stranger in the crowd could doubt ‘twas Casey at the bat.


Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;


Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt;


Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,


Defiance flashed in Casey’s eye, a sneer curled Casey’s lip.


And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,


And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.


Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped—


“That ain’t my style,” said Casey. “Strike one!” the umpire said.


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,


Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore;


“Kill him! Kill the umpire!” shouted someone on the stand;


And it’s likely they’d have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.


With a smile of Christian charity great Casey’s visage shone;


He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;


He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the dun sphere flew;


But Casey still ignored it and the umpire said, “Strike two!”


“Fraud!” cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered “Fraud!”


But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.


They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,


And they knew that Casey wouldn’t let that ball go by again.


The sneer is gone from Casey’s lip, his teeth are clenched in hate,


He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate;


And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,


And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey’s blow.


Oh, somewhere in this favoured land the sun is shining bright,


The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;


And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout,


But there is no joy in Mudville—mighty Casey has struck out.


 - Some students may notice that the poem “Casey at the Bat” has a very regular

rhythm. This is because it is written in meter; it generally follows an iambic

pattern in which each unstressed syllable is followed by a stressed syllable.

Students will learn to recognize metrical patterns in later grades, but if they

hear them now, affirm their listening skills.

**Discussion of Poetry Structures**


 - Tell students that while they may still have questions about this poem, they

already know more about it than they might realize.


 - Remind students of the title of a piece of fictional prose they read as a class,

ask them to raise one finger if they consider the work a poem and two fingers

if they do not.


 - Use students’ responses to briefly discuss and review important elements of

poetry, as described in the unit, that do not usually appear in prose, including

alliteration, verse, stanzas, rhythm, and rhyme.


 - In the Writing segment of the lesson, as students share the poems they wrote

with a peer, have them describe elements unique to poetry that they included

in their poems.


 - Direct students to Poet’s Journal 10.1, review the instructions, and ask them to

complete the questions.


**Poet’s Journal 10.1**


**Poetic Structure**


1. What is a stanza?


» A stanza is a section of a poem; it consists of a line or group of lines.


2. Number the stanzas in the poem “Casey at the Bat.” How many stanzas does

the poem contain?


» The poem has thirteen stanzas.


3. How many lines are in each stanza?


» Each stanza has four lines.


4. Write down the rhyming words in the poem’s first stanza.


» The rhymes are _day_ / _play_ and _same_ / _game_ .


 - Review answers aloud.

» The poem, “Casey at the Bat,” differs from a short story because it has poetic

elements such as alliteration, verse, stanzas, rhythm, and rhyme. For example, the

Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


text is broken up into 13 stanzas instead of paragraphs. Each stanza has four lines

in which the first two lines rhyme and the last two lines rhyme. An example of this

is that the last word of the first line in paragraph thirteen is “bright” and the last

word of the next line is “light”. This sort of rhyming pattern is one of the ways that

the text can be distinguished from being a short story.

~~**ABOUT THE POET**~~


**Ernest Lawrence Thayer**


Ernest Lawrence Thayer was born on August 14, 1863, in Lawrence,

Massachusetts, to a wealthy family. He attended private schools as a boy, then

studied philosophy at Harvard University. He was the editor and president

of _Lampoon_, a Harvard literary magazine. After graduating, he moved to San

Francisco and worked for _The San Francisco Examiner_ writing humorous

columns and poetry.


Thayer left San Francisco due to poor health and moved back to

Massachusetts. He continued to write poetry, however, for several newspapers

around the country. He is most famous for “Casey at the Bat,” which is

considered the most well-known baseball poem. The poem became so popular

that it was made into a short film in 1914. Thayer remained ill for the rest of his

life and did little writing, but he enjoyed reciting his famous poems for friends.

He died in 1940.

Lesson 11 From Kavikanthabharana
**133**


**134**



**Why We Selected It**


Kshemendra’s excerpt, from a twelfth-century text on poets and poetry,

offers a view of the timeless role poets play in society. By focusing overtly

on the responsibilities of poets, this poem challenges students to consider

how poetry remains a distinctive craft. The poem’s call for exploration and

attentive engagement will serve students well in any pursuit, though it also

offers a useful springboard for students to consider how they might continue

developing as poets beyond this unit.


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Reading**


- The poem “From _Kavikanthabharana_ ” can be found in the Anthology.


- Arrange the class into five groups: A–E, based on the sections of poems

listed below.


   - Example section: Lines 1–2


   - Section A: Lines 3–4


   - Section B: Lines 5–6


   - Section C: Lines 7–9


   - Section D: Line 10


   - Section E: Lines 11–14


- Distribute a copy of each group’s section of the poem.


   - The length of a selection does not always indicate its difficulty; for

example, section E is long but straightforward, while section D is brief

but requires more imagination to interpret. You may wish to assign each

section to a group before class so that you match more challenging

sections with groups of students best equipped for those challenges.

**Introduce the Reading**


 - Tell students that the poem in this lesson comes from a twelfth-century book

on poets and poetry. As they listen to the poem, they should think about what

the poet, Kshemendra, believes a poet’s different responsibilities are.


Check for Understanding


After students have accumulated a list of such differences, tell them that
as they listen to the poem, they should think about whether or not the
responsibilities it describes for poets are very different from or similar to
the responsibilities of poets today.


 - Read the poem aloud.

 - _Example_


   - Write the example section below on the board/chart paper. Model the

following questions and answers, also writing them on the board.


2. **Evaluative.** What is the literal meaning of the section?


» Poets should understand how plants are structured.


3. **Evaluative.** What are some possible broader meanings of the section?


» Poets should understand how nature works.


4. **Inferential.** Why might this be an important thing for poets to do?


» This question has many possible answers. Poets may need to understand nature

in order to write about it. They might need to practice careful observational skills

in order to compose poems with strong details. They might be responsible for

describing the mysteries of nature in a way that makes sense to readers.


5. **Inferential.** Often, if we know what something does, we can make an

inference about why it matters. Based on your answers to the previous

questions, why does poetry matter?


» One reason poetry matters is that it helps explain and reveal nature to readers.

It highlights things readers may not have noticed on their own and helps them

experience and understand new things.

**Interpreting a Passage**


In this activity you will work in groups to answer the following questions about

part of the _Kavikanthabharana_ . Your teacher will give your group a section of

the poem to work on and will review the first example.


Use the excerpt of the poem you were given to answer the following questions.


Write your section of the poem in the space below.


» Answers will vary based on the assigned section.


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


1. What is the literal meaning of the section?

(A) Poets should bring people together and make them laugh.


(B) Poets should understand people’s true selves.


(C) Poets should know about the different parts of the earth and space.


(D) Poets should understand the changes taking place in the world.


Note: Section D is perhaps the most challenging section, as it is open to a
wide range of interpretations. Make sure students are considering the text in
crafting their responses.


(E) Poets should travel and learn a lot of languages.


2. What are some possible broader meanings of the section?

(B) If you understand people, you will be better able to communicate with them.


(C) Poets should know how things work together and relate to each other, the way
the moon and the tides of the ocean are connected.


(D) Poets should describe the different ways things work or exist. They should
see how things grow and change.


(E) Poets should be people who experience many parts of the world, who are
always learning new things.

4. Often, if we know what something does, we can make an inference about

why it matters. Based on your answers to the previous questions, why does

poetry matter?


» Answers may vary, but possible answers for each lettered poem section you

distributed are provided below.


(A) People need joy and laughter, and poetry can help provide those things.
Poetry can unite people, which means they might work together toward
common goals.


(B) Poetry can offer people a different way to communicate with one another,
which can sometimes help them understand one another better. It can help
them think about what life is like for others.


(C) When poets use their language to explain how different parts of an
environment influence each other, it provides readers the opportunity to learn
about their perspective.


(D) By understanding the different qualities of things, poets are able to describe
them more fully and accurately to readers. Seeing how things change and
can have different qualities can help poets think about how to use figurative
language or make comparisons between things that might otherwise
seem unalike.


(E) Writing poetry is a way of learning something new. It also requires poets to
use language in new ways, to surprise readers with figurative language or
other new ways of describing things.


 - Review each group’s answers aloud.


 - If groups struggle with this activity, you might review the answers to each

question before allowing each group to move forward to the next question. If

groups are confident in the activity, you may wait to review their answers to

questions 1–4 in a single session.


 - As students answer question 4, list their responses on the whiteboard or other

display area. By the conclusion of their responses, they will have assembled a

list of reasons that poetry matters.


**Reading for Application**


 - Remind students that this poem was written in the twelfth century, so it is

nearly nine hundred years old. Tell students that Kshemendra had excellent

ideas about poetry, but it might be helpful to think about how those ideas

would work in the twenty-first century.


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


 - Direct students to Poet’s Journal 11.2, review the instructions, and then have

each group work together to complete questions 1–3.


1. List at least three ways you could practice this during the next week.


» Count the number of different plants around my house or in my neighborhood.


Draw the leaves of those plants and notice how they are different.


Take a family member or friend on a walk and point out the different plants
you see.


2. List at least three ways you could practice this as you grow older.


» Visit a botanical garden or greenhouse to learn about plants I have never

seen before.


Take a class in botany, the study of plants.


Study a book that teaches how to identify different kinds of plants by the leaves
they have.


3. List at least three different kinds of poems you could write about the

ideas above.


» Write a poem that describes the different plants in your neighborhood. You might

use Walt Whitman’s “I Hear America Singing” from Lesson 4 as an example.


Write a poem that describes your visit to a garden or greenhouse. You might use
Nikki Giovanni’s “My First Memory (of Librarians)” from Lesson 2 as an example.


Write a poem that lists the questions you have about plants. You might use
Norman Ault’s “Wishes” from Lesson 1 as an example.


**Poet’s Journal 11.2**


**Ideas for Poets**


Now it’s time to think about how you can apply Kshemendra’s ideas to your

own life as a poet. Working together with your group and using the section of

the poem assigned to your group, answer the following questions. Your teacher

will review the first example before you start. You may refer to the literal or the

broader meaning of the section in developing your answers.


Write your group’s section of the poem below, then use the ideas in it to

answer questions 1–3.

1. List at least three ways you could practice this during the next week.


» Answers will vary, although in this section it is important that students are crafting

tangible things they might accomplish relatively simply. Therefore, if students

propose traveling to other countries, for example, remind them that it is unlikely

they will do that within the next week. In that time frame they might, however,

learn to say “Hello” in several different languages.


2. List at least three ways you could practice this as you grow older.

~~**WRITING ADVICE POEMS (30 MIN.)**~~


**Introduce Advice Poems**


 - Remind students that just like Kshemendra, they have already made their own

lists of how to continue practicing seeing the world as poets and of ideas for

new poems to write in the extra pages of their journals.


 - Tell students that in the following activity, they will use the knowledge they’ve

learned in this unit to write advice poems for new readers of poetry.


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.11.A** Plan a first draft by selecting a genre for a
particular topic, purpose, and audience using a range of strategies such as brainstorming, freewriting, and mapping;
**TEKS 4.12.A** Compose literary texts such as personal narratives and poetry using genre characteristics and craft.


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


1. **Literal.** What are different poetic devices a poet might use?


» Possible answers include figurative language, metaphor, simile, repetition, rhyme,

stanza or line breaks, dialogue, meter, and tone.


2. **Evaluative.** What is the most important thing you have learned about how to

read a poem?


» Answers will vary. Students may speak about the importance of hearing poems as

well as reading them, looking at poems more than once, or drawing on details to

help figure out what point the author is making.


 - Direct students to Poet’s Journal 11.3, review the instructions, and have them

follow the prompts to compose their original advice poems. Students are

expected to write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.


**Poet’s Journal 11.3**


**Writing Advice Poems**


Now it’s your turn to write an advice poem. In this poem, you will describe

what a reader of poetry should do. Follow the prompts below to compose your

poem. As you work, you may want to think about the list of ideas your class

brainstormed. You may also look back at the excerpt from _Kavikanthabharana_

if you would like.


1. Name at least three things you try to notice when you read a poem for the

first time.


2. What is the most important thing you have learned about reading poetry?


3. What helps you most when you read a poem?


4. When you find a poem you really love, what do you do?


Now use your answers above to write an advice poem for people who have

never read poetry before. What would they need to know in order to read

poetry successfully? Make sure your poem tells them at least four different

things about what poetry readers should know or do.


If you finish with time remaining, read back over your poem. Make sure to

give it a title. Then think about all the tools you have been given in this unit for

reading poetry. Is there someone you know who might enjoy reading poetry,

too? Maybe you could give them a copy of this poem as a way to inspire or

encourage them.

~~**ABOUT THE POET**~~


**Kshemendra**


Writing during the twelfth century, Kshemendra lived in the region today

known as India. Kshemendra wrote in the ancient language Sanskrit. He wrote

epic poems based on various stories and religions. Additionally, Kshemendra

was a playwright, a novelist, and a historian.


Despite being born into a wealthy and powerful family, Kshemendra wrote

about downtrodden or common people, topics that appealed to the masses.

His work remained mostly unknown until its discovery in 1871. In total,

eighteen pieces of his writing have been found and translated. Now people

from all over the world can read his work in their own language and appreciate

this once-forgotten poet.

**Grade 4 Unit 7|**
##### Pausing Point


Please use the final two days to address class results of the Unit Assessment.

Based on the results of the unit assessment and students’ formative

assessments, you may wish to use the remaining time to provide remediation

opportunities that target specific areas of weakness for individual students,

small groups, or the whole class.


~~**REMEDIATION**~~


**Content**

If students demonstrate a need for remediation on any of the elements of

the Poetry unit, refer to the lessons covering that element. You may wish to

reteach any poem as a teacher Read-Aloud, regardless of the type of lesson

initially used for that poem. Additionally, you should focus more heavily on the

questions labeled Support in the Teacher Guide materials for that lesson.


**Fluency**


Students who struggle with fluency will benefit from having multiple

opportunities to re-read a particular text. If students demonstrate a need for

remediation related to fluency, you may have them either re-read selections

from the Reader or choose an excerpt from the Fluency Supplement.


**Writing**


If students demonstrate a need for remediation in writing skills, refer to the

individual lessons in which particular skills were addressed. You may wish to

create specific writing prompts targeting the particular skill in which students

need additional practice.


~~**ENRICHMENT READING AND WRITING ACTIVITIES**~~


If students have mastered the skills in the Poetry unit, their experience with

the concepts may be enriched by re-reading the unit poetry and explaining

the use of figurative language, such as simile, metaphor and personification

that the poet uses to create images in applicable poems. For additional editing

practice and application, consult the Editing Supplement, which can be found

in the Pausing Point. For example, if students are writing a response and need

to edit for capitalization, use the TEKS-aligned sample activities for guidance.


Pausing Point
**151**


**152**



If students are writing a response about Momaday, a Native American poet, it

would be helpful to teach students that we capitalize Native Americans, which

aligns with TEKS 4.11.D.ix.


~~**TEKS 4.9.B; TEKS 4.11.D.ix**~~


**simile - n.** comparison using the words like or as


**metaphor - n.** comparison that does not use like or as


**personification - n.** attributing human-like characteristics to nonhuman things


~~**ENRICHMENT PERFORMANCE ACTIVITIES**~~


**Poetry Performance**


A poetry performance is a fun, energetic celebration of poetry and the

classroom community that gives students an opportunity to commemorate

their writing. It is designed to:


 - allow students to become familiar with poetry, its different forms, and how it

is written.


 - help students become more self-assured when speaking before others.


 - help students improve their reading, spelling, vocabulary, and other

language skills.


Before you begin the performance, have a brief discussion with students

about the expectations for how an audience should work with the performer.

Ask students how they would want to be treated during their performances.

Collect student responses onto a list to post in the classroom as rules

for discussion.


You may wish to change the classroom environment by moving tables and

desks to the sides of the room, making a space for the stage, turning the lights

down, and/or enlisting students to help you plan or make decorations.


**The Performance**


This is a culmination of the Poetry unit, in which all students have generated

their own material. Students may read several lines from an exercise they are

proud of or a full poem they have created.


**TEKS 4.9.B** Explain simile, metaphor, and personification that the poet uses to create images; **TEKS 4.11.D.ix** Capitalization
of historical periods, events, and documents, titles of books, stories and essays; and languages, races, and nationalities.


Unit 7 Poetry: Wondrous Words


As students perform, audience members should reflect on the work of their

peers on paper. Use the short reflection sheet to help students understand

how to construct positive feedback.


**Poet’s Journal PP.1**


**Performance reflection Sheet**


1. What did you like about the subject of the poem—what it was about?


2. What did you like about the language that was used in the poem? Did the

student use figurative language, or alliteration, or anaphora?


3. What did you like about how the speaker performed the poem?


4. Did anything stand out for you? What was it and why?


Remember to focus on positive feedback. Of course you can have constructive

feedback, too—what can be improved. You may wish to write that down, but do

not share it for now.


~~**POETRY PORTFOLIO**~~


Tell students that space has been included in the back of their _Poet’s Journal_

for them to continue working on their drafts and on new poems. At the end of

the year, students may wish to submit a poetry portfolio with their poems and

illustrations. Ask them to add a poet’s bio about themselves.


~~**EMBEDDING THE EDITING PROCESS**~~


Revising and editing can be challenging for students. It may be helpful to follow

the steps below to help your students as they revise and edit their own work.


This process can be done at the sentence level, in addition to extended written

pieces. By using students’ quick writes and shorter responses, instructional

time can be maximized and the writing process will be authentic to what

students are composing.


**Steps for Successful Editing**


1. Model the editing process during writing instruction and target a single skill at

a time.


Pausing Point
**153**


2. Select a text with errors to provide guided practice in small groups.


3. P artner or pair students for collaborative practice using pre-selected texts

with errors.


4. P rovide opportunities for students to practice independently by editing their

own work or the work of a peer.


5. C onference with students in small groups or individually to provide corrective

and informative feedback.


6. Repeat the process by modeling a new grammar or convention skill.


**Last, but not least...**


 - Start with single sentences before moving onto longer pieces of writing.


 - Explicit grammar lessons can be reinforced using a variety of texts. Use

sentences from Read-Aloud or Student Reader texts to use as mentor

sentences.


 - Have students apply their understanding of a targeted skill in their short and

extended constructed responses.


 - Provide rehearsal opportunities during collaborative and independent writing

time.


 - Grammar is best taught in the context of student writing.


 - Incorporate spelling practice including use of high frequency words in written

compositions.

|4.11.D.v|adverbs that convey<br>frequency and adverbs<br>that convey degree|Target common errors in adverb usage such as<br>• Incorrect placement of adverbs (e.g., “She quickly ran”<br>instead of “She ran quickly”).<br>• Overuse or misuse of adverbs (e.g., redundant adverbs like<br>“very quickly”).<br>• Missing adverbs where clarification or emphasis is needed.<br>Model the correct usage of adverbs during writing instruction<br>and encourage students to use adverbs in written responses.<br>Collect responses and use one of the student’s written pieces to<br>edit as a class.|
|4.11.D.vi|prepositions and<br>prepositional phrases|Common errors include:<br>• Incorrect preposition usage (e.g., “She is in the home”<br>instead of “She is at home”).<br>• Incorrect prepositional phrase placement or structure.<br>• Missing or unnecessary prepositions.<br>After teaching students about the function and use of<br>preposition and prepositional phrases, have them notice them<br>in the texts they are reading. As editing practice, have students<br>take turns reading their written piece aloud to a partner.<br>The partner will listen for the incorrect usage and, together,<br>students can edit the sentence to make it correct.|
|4.11.D.vii|pronouns, including<br>reflexive|Provide sentences with subject-object relationships or with<br>multiple instances of reflexive pronouns. Engage students in<br>a class discussion about the errors and how to correct them.<br>Provide students with opportunities to edit their own pieces for<br>the correct usage of reflexive pronouns.|
|4.11.D.viii|coordinating<br>conjunctions to form<br>compound subjects,<br>predicates, and<br>sentences|Provide students with stems that have different coordinating<br>conjunctions. For example, Cooking is rewarding because…<br>Cooking is rewarding, but…Cooking is rewarding, so… This is<br>a fun activity to tie to content students are currently learning<br>about because it can serve as a check for understanding for<br>comprehension. Students can edit their sentences after writing<br>them. Editing for coordinating conjunctions is appropriate to do<br>during revision when students are adding or rearranging their<br>details for clarity and coherence.|
|4.11.D.ix|capitalization of<br>historical periods,<br>events and documents;<br>titles of books; stories<br>and essays; and<br>languages, races, and<br>nationalities|Use lessons and activities provided in the product for<br>capitalizing historical periods, events, documents, titles, stories,<br>essays, and languages, races, and nationalities.
