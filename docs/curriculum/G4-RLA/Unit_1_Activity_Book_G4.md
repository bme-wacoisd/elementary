**A Memory Paragraph**

_In this activity you will write a paragraph describing a school memory. Write your_
_paragraph legibly in cursive. It could be exciting, funny, scary, or surprising, but it must be_
_true._


1. Start by brainstorming some school memories on the following lines. Try to write at
least five different ideas. Then circle the one you want to write about.


2. What makes a good paragraph?


W riters often organize good paragraphs using a common set of guidelines. First,
writers include a topic sentence to introduce the topic or central idea of the
paragraph. The topic sentence tells what the paragraph will be about. Next, writers
include supporting sentences to explain the topic or central idea. Writers usually
include at least three to five sentences to give the reader supporting details and facts
about the topic or central idea. Including interesting facts and details helps make the
paragraph informative and interesting to read. It is important that the sentences stick
to the topic. Finally, writers end the paragraph with a concluding sentence, or their
final thought about the topic or central idea. Using these guidelines can be helpful for
writing a clear and informative paragraph.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **1**


3. Write a paragraph that includes:


A. Topic Sentence: Start with a sentence introducing the memory.

B. Supporting Sentences: Describe what happened, how you felt, how people reacted,
and any other interesting details you remember.

C. Concluding Sentence: End your paragraph by explaining why the memory is
important.


_Do your best with spelling and punctuation—it is OK if you need to guess. This is a rough_
_draft, and the most important thing is to write an interesting, true story. Write your_
_paragraph legibly in cursive._

**Reading Six-Word Memories**

The “six-word memory” challenges writers to share a true story, just like your paragraph
from Activity 1.1, but using very few words. With only six words, narrators must be very
careful to pick words that do a lot of work.

_Read the first two memories and discuss them with your class and teacher._

_Then read the remaining memories. List all the details you can figure out, or infer, from the_
_six words the author has chosen. Be careful only to include inferences you can support with_
_the text. Consider: where and when does the story take place? How does the narrator feel?_
_Explain how you figured it out._


1. Snow angels, loving family, hot chocolate.


2. Snow falling, teeth chattering, keep warm.


3. Swallowed tooth, morning, dollar under pillow.


4. High swings, chain slacks, grass-stained knees.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **7**


5. Wheels spin, pedals slip, hello gravel.


6. Each year, more pie, happy holiday.


7. Moon, lake, camp friends sharing stories.


8. Award ceremony, signed certificate, feeling proud.


9. My dog, tunneling through snow mountains.

**Writing Six-Word Memories**

_Flip back to Activity Page 1.1 and circle the most important words in the paragraph. When_
_choosing your words, think about what is most important in the memory. Also think about_
_what words are most specific, or create the most immediate and interesting picture in your_
_head. There may be a few more than six, but no more than ten. Write them below:_


_Now choose six words from that list that can make a six-word memory that makes sense._


Six-word memory:


1. What facts, events, and details did you include from your longer paragraph?


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **9**


2. Why did you choose to include these facts, events, and details?


3. What did you leave out? Why did you choose to leave it out?


4. What do you think a reader will be able to infer from your six-word memory?

2. Choose sensory details that describe one of the foods you listed on the previous page.
For sound, you might describe the noise the food makes while it cooks (e.g., hot dogs
on a grill sizzle and soda fizzes when it is first opened) or the sound it makes when
you bite into it (apples crunch). Try to come up with more than one detail for some of
the senses. For example, when describing what a food looks like, you might describe
its size, shape, and color.

1. Quotation marks are placed before the first word of the dialogue and after the
punctuation mark that ends the dialogue.


Example:


2. When the tag follows the dialogue, it ends in a period. When the tag precedes the
dialogue, it ends in a comma.


Example:


3. The punctuation that ends a line of dialogue is written inside the quotation marks.


Example:


4. When the tag follows the dialogue, quotes that do not end in an exclamation point or
question mark end in a comma instead of a period.


Example:


Correct: ____________________________________________________________


Incorrect: ___________________________________________________________

ACTIVITY PAGE



Polio is a serious and contagious illness caused by a virus. The polio virus spreads

through contact with feces or less commonly, being coughed or sneezed on. Most people

infected with the virus have no symptoms. For others it results in flu-like symptoms such

as fever, sore throat, nausea, headache, and tiredness. But when the polio virus affects the

brain and spinal cord it is very serious and can cause severe symptoms, including muscle

weakness and paralysis, which may be temporary or permanent. While polio can infect

anyone, it mostly affects children.

Stories and drawings from as early as the year 1500 BC suggest that people have

gotten sick with polio for a long time. In 1789 AD, British physician Michael Underwood

published the first description of polio in medical literature, and in 1840 a German doctor

named it “infantile paralysis.”

Polio epidemics increased in the late 1800s, and polio epidemics occurred regularly

in the United States throughout the first half of the 20th century. Because polio is so

contagious, these epidemics were very frightening, and communities treated the threat

very seriously. Swimming pools closed, and children were not allowed in other public

gathering places, such as movie theaters. In the summer, when polio epidemics were most

likely to occur, some parents kept their children indoors or made them wear gloves.

One of the most famous polio patients was Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In 1921, when

he was 39 years old and already an important politician, he developed polio. Although

he recovered, and worked hard on rehabilitation, his legs were permanently paralyzed.

Even so, he was elected president in 1932 and led the United States through the Great

Depression and much of World War II. During his presidency, he created the National

Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, later called the March of Dimes, which raised money

to help polio patients and to research a vaccine or cure for polio.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **61**


The March of Dimes funded research by two main scientists. Dr. Jonas Salk and Dr.

Albert Sabin were both working on inventing vaccines, but using different approaches.

Dr. Salk’s vaccine was ready first in 1953. He was so sure of his vaccine that he started by

testing it on himself and his family. Some of his lab workers also chose to have it tested on

themselves. The results were promising. No one got sick, and everyone developed polio

antibodies.

In 1954, Dr. Salk and his researchers vaccinated almost two million healthy school

children. A year later the results were in: the vaccine worked! Over the next two years,

polio rates in the United States fell over 80%. Soon after, in 1959, Dr. Albert Sabin’s version

of the vaccine was also proven effective.

Both Dr. Salk and Dr. Sabin chose to make the details of their research and how to

manufacture their vaccines public. If they had chosen to keep it secret, they might have

made a lot of money selling their vaccines, but they decided it was important to share

so that the vaccines could be produced and distributed as quickly and inexpensively as

possible.

Today, thanks to vaccination, polio has been eliminated in the Western hemisphere,

which includes the United States, Mexico, Canada, South and Central America, and parts

of Europe. While polio is still present in a few countries, including Pakistan, Afghanistan,

and Nigeria, programs dedicated to vaccination are working hard to wipe out polio

worldwide.

**Transition Words**

_Transition words and phrases are what you use in writing to connect one idea to the next._

_In a personal narrative, the ideas that are connected might be events or moments. For_
_example, in_ Small Steps, _phrases like “two days earlier” and “three days later” are transition_
_phrases that help the story move smoothly from event to event._

_Sometimes transition words or phrases relate to time (for example,_ the next day, afterwards) _._


1. Reread the following paragraph from “Clara Driscoll: Lessons I Learned on a Cattle
Drive” and underline what you think are the transitional words and phrases. Look
for words that create a sequence, or connect the ideas in a sentence to the previous
sentence.


“While riding together, we passed a farmhouse with the roof missing and walls

stained black from smoke. It looked like a fire had gotten out of control and now all that

was left were the remnants of a once-loved home. “I guess they had to find somewhere

else to live,” I casually said. My daddy was quiet for a minute and then replied, “Your

granddaddy taught me that a home’s worth isn’t just in the walls or the roof, but the

memories that are inside. You can rebuild the walls and roof, but those memories outlive

the fire.” That night, I thought about those words as I drifted off to sleep. I wondered if

memories moved to new houses as people did.”

**Transition Words in List of Events**


1. As a class, read the events of “Clara Driscoll: Lessons I Learned on a Cattle Drive” and
underline the transition words.


**“Clara Driscoll: Lessons I Learned on a Cattle Drive” (the whole essay)**


A. First, Clara describes her memories from going on cattle drives with her father.


B. Next, Clara and her father pass an old farmhouse that had burned down.


C. The next day, Clara and her father have breakfast on the cattle drive.


D. Later, Clara asked her father what happens to our memories when we move, and
he taught her that “memories live inside of us.”


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **75**


E. In the end, Clara’s father teaches her about her grandfather and his legacy.


F. Also, Clara’s father teaches her that her memories will always be with her, and she
reflects on how her experiences make her who she is.


2. Now make a list of events for the memory you chose on Activity Page 7.4. List them
in chronological order. Describe each event in one complete sentence and use a
transitional word in each sentence. You will have time in future classes to add more
sentences and details to describe your event. Try to include at least five events, but feel
free to write as many as you can.

**Feelings and Emotions in “The Diagnosis”**

In a personal narrative, the narrator’s feelings are important details that make the
narrative more interesting and informative.

Reread part 1 and part 2 of “The Diagnosis” aloud with your partner, switching between
each paragraph. Pay particular attention to how the narrator describes the way she feels.

In the left-hand column of the chart on the next page, list the narrator’s feelings. At
least one of these should be physical, and one emotional. Remember: “my head hurt” is
physical. “I felt frightened” is emotional.

List your supporting evidence in the right-hand column. Supporting evidence may be a
quote from the text or a description of what is happening in the text in your own words.
If you use exact words from the text, remember to put them in quotation marks.

**All about Accordions**

When you write a personal narrative, you cannot assume that your readers have had
the same experiences as you. In fact, sometimes the most interesting stories to read
were written by people who have had very different experiences from those of their
readers.

Good writers often describe their experiences so well that readers can understand and
visualize what is happening even if they have not experienced something like it themselves.

_Reread the passage on Reader pages 41–42 in which Peg describes learning to play the_
_accordion. In the space that follows, write down all the textual details you can find that_
_relate to the accordion or how to play it._

_feel it should be longer, or include more events, discuss these changes with your teacher_
_before you write._

_A conclusion helps the reader pull the whole the story together._

**Beginning-of-Year Reading Comprehension Assessment**

_Today you will read three selections. The first selection is called “The Cat,” the second_
_selection is called “The Wolf, the Elk, and the Aspen Tree,” and the third selection is called_
_“Invasive Species.” After reading each passage, you will answer several questions based on_
_the text. Some of the questions have two parts. You should answer Part A of the question_
_before you answer Part B._


**Passage 1: “The Cat”**


1 Once upon a time in Denmark, there was a man named Franz. Franz lived a good life
all year long, until one night. That evening, a pack of horrible, badly behaved trolls
descended on him. The trolls drove poor Franz from his house and took over the
place for the night.


2 This went on for many years on the exact same night every year, until, one year, a
famous hunter visited the house the morning of the dreaded night. The hunter had
just captured a large white bear and planned to present it to the king of Denmark.
The hunter had a long journey ahead of him and asked Franz if he and the bear could
spend the night.


3 “I would let you stay,” said Franz, “but I can’t, for every year at this time I am visited
by trolls at night who drive me out of the house. They will be here tonight and you do
not want to be here when they arrive!”


4 “Oh,” said the hunter, “I am not afraid of trolls. If that is all you are worried about, let
me stay in the house. The bear can sleep under the stove there. I will sleep in the back,
in the comfortable bedroom.”


5 “Very well,” said Franz. “You may stay, at your own risk, but I must get the house
ready for the trolls. If I don’t, they will be furious.”


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **139**


6 Franz worked diligently to get his house ready for the trolls. He chopped wood and
built a fire. He set the table with his best dishes and loaded them with porridge,
assorted fruit, smoked fish, and delicious sausages. When he was done, he left the
hunter and the bear in the house and went to stay with a friend.


7 At sunset, the trolls arrived. They stormed into the house and began a raucous
celebration. They ate and drank, sang songs, and made a terrible mess.


8 One of the trolls caught a glimpse of the bear. It was lying under the stove, with only
an ear sticking out.


9 “Look!” the troll said, “Franz has a cat!”


10 The troll cut off a bit of sausage and tossed it on the floor. Then, he kicked the bear in
the ear and shouted, “Wake up, kitty! Get the sausage!”


11 The bear rose up on its hind legs, ripping the stove away from the floor. The stove was
launched across the room. The bear, in a great fury, roared ferociously. The trolls were
terrified. They screamed and ran for their lives.


12 Franz returned home the next day. He cleaned up the horrific mess the trolls had
made, repaired the stove, and lived another year in his house. When the dreaded
evening arrived once again the next year, he expected the trolls to come again. He
went out into the yard to cut wood for them.


13 After a few minutes, he heard a voice calling, “Franz! Franz!”


14 Franz squinted into the woods but saw nothing but trees.


15 Then, he heard the voice again say, “Franz! Franz!”


16 “Yes?” Franz said. “What is it?”


17 “Have you still got that huge, ferocious cat?” the voice asked.


18 Franz thought for a minute. Then, he replied.

19 “Yes,” Franz said. “I still have the cat. It is lying under the stove, and, earlier this year,
it had seven kittens. Now, all of the kittens have grown up. They are bigger and fiercer
than their mother!”


20 “Egad!” said the voice. “Then, you will never see us again!”


21 Franz heard a rustling of feet in the woods. Then, there was silence.


22 After that, Franz went on with his life and the trolls never bothered him again.

**Passage 2: “The Wolf, the Elk, and the Aspen Tree”**


1 The wolf is the villain in some of the greatest stories ever told.


2 Who chased the three little pigs and blew down their houses? It was the wolf,
of course!


3 Who pestered Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother? The wolf!


4 These are fiction stories, but they tell us a lot about how real people felt about wolves
in the old days. For many years, people were scared of wolves. They worried that
wolves might attack their farm animals. They also worried that wolves might attack
them or their children.


5 People hated wolves. They disliked them so much that they paid people to hunt them.
In England, King William I paid hunters per wolf pelt. The rulers of Russia, the tsars,
paid hunters for an adult wolf and half of the adult wolf amount for a wolf cub. The
kings of Sweden viewed wolf hunting as a civic duty. They expected every able-bodied
man to help out with wolf hunts.


6 The European settlers who came to America brought this way of thinking with them.
They hunted wolves to protect themselves and their livestock. The development of
guns helped them. By 1920, wolves had been wiped out in most parts of the United
States. At the time, almost everyone thought this was a good thing. Most people did
not see any reason to keep wolves around. “Good riddance!” they said.


7 In the past few years, a lot of people have changed their mind about wolves. Scientists
who studied Yellowstone National Park were some of the first to change. They noticed
that certain kinds of trees were starting to die out in the park. One of the trees they
were worried about was the aspen tree. There were lots of old-growth aspen trees in
Yellowstone, meaning there were lots of aspen trees that had been there a long time.
But there were very few young aspens.

**DATE:**

ASSESSMENT



8 Scientists investigated this. They found that elk were a big part of the problem. Elk
like the taste of aspen seedlings and there were lots of elk in the park. In the old days,
packs of wolves preyed on the elk. The wolves kept the herds of elk from getting too
big. But the wolves had been wiped out. There were no predators left who hunted for
elk. A pack of elk could spend all day eating aspen seedlings. They did not have to
worry about predators.


9 The scientists had an idea. They thought they might be able to help the aspen trees
by bringing in wolves. This idea was very controversial. Many farmers and ranchers
objected. They still viewed the wolves as farmers in the old days had—as a threat to
people and livestock. They thought bringing wolves back was a bad idea.


10 It took many years to convince people that it might be a good idea to bring wolves to
Yellowstone. Wolves were finally re-introduced there in 1995.


11 Several years later the scientists went back to the park to see if their plan was working.
They found evidence that it was. Many of the wolves they had brought in survived.
The wolves had formed packs and begun hunting. They were also having pups. There
were still lots of elk in the park, but the elk were starting to get nervous. They could
no longer spend all day nibbling aspen saplings. They had to be a bit more careful.
Some aspen trees had survived. They had grown large enough that elk could no
longer eat them.


12 “This is really exciting!” said one of the researchers. “It’s great news for Yellowstone.
The level of recovery we are seeing is very encouraging.”


13 So here is one story in which the wolf is not the villain!


14 There are some lessons for human beings in this story. One lesson is that we need to
be careful when we make decisions about the impact of a species. In the past, some
animals were thought of as harmful. Some people thought that we would be better
without these animals. In the past few decades we have come to understand that it
can be wrong to think that way. This is because many of the animals and plants in an
ecosystem are interdependent. That means they all depend on each other. They are
connected in ways we may not notice at first. When we get rid of one animal, we may
put other animals or plants at risk. We may remove an animal’s food source or we may
remove its main predator, as happened in Yellowstone. Every ecosystem has its own
balance. If we remove one species, it is possible that the whole system will be thrown
out of balance.

_Questions 9–14 pertain to Passage 2: “The Wolf, the Elk, and the Aspen Tree”_


9. What does the information in paragraph 4 help the reader understand about wolves?

A. Fiction stories about wolves are not true.

B. Scientists view wolves as a threat to people and livestock.

back to Yellowstone?

A. The farmers thought they might be able to help the aspen trees.

Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **149**


**Passage 3: “Invasive Species”**


1 In today’s world, everyone is on the move. People jet from one city to another.
Tourists visit foreign countries. Immigrants leave their homes and settle in new lands.


2 But did you know that animals are also on the move? Sometimes people bring exotic
animals back from their trips. Sometimes, they buy exotic animals in pet shops. Other
times, the animals travel by themselves. They may sneak into crates that are shipped
from one country to another or they may find their way onto ships that cross the
oceans.


3 This animal travel has caused some problems. Sometimes animals end up in a new
place that is just right for them. The land is just right for them. The climate is perfect.
There is lots of food. This is a good thing for them. But it may be a bad thing for other
animals in the ecosystem. The newly arrived animals may settle in and have babies.
They may disrupt the ecosystem by eating up or crowding out the native animals.
When this happens, we say the ecosystem has a problem with “invasive species.” The
ecosystem is being invaded by outsiders.


4 There are invasive species in many parts of the United States. In Florida, the invasive
species that people are most worried about these days is the Burmese python.
Burmese pythons are snakes that are native to Asia and not native to Florida. They are
big snakes. An average Burmese python is twelve feet long.


5 Burmese pythons like to live near water, but they can also slither up into trees. These
snakes are carnivores. They eat small mammals like rats and mice. They also eat birds.
The Burmese python is a constrictor. It bites its victim and holds it. Then, it wraps
itself around the victim and squeezes it to to death, then the snake swallows it whole.

6 So how did these Burmese pythons make their way to Florida? Some people like to
keep snakes as pets. There was only one problem: the snake might eventually get too
big for its cage. Experts think some pet owners set their snakes free when they got too
big. Some pythons may also have escaped when a hurricane hit Florida in 1996.


7 In any case, thousands of Burmese pythons now make their home in the swamps
of southern Florida. This part of Florida is warm, wet, and full of small mammals.
At least, it used to be full of small mammals. A 2011 study found that lots of small
mammals in these areas are in trouble. The pythons are gobbling up raccoons, rabbits,
and opossums. They are even eating larger animals, including deer, bobcats, and
alligators!


8 Experts are worried. They are afraid that the pythons may wipe out some of the
endangered species that live in the area. A new law has made it illegal for pet shops in
the United States to sell Burmese pythons. Another law has allowed hunters to hunt
pythons. Officials are hoping these laws will help keep the python problem under
control.


9 In the Midwest, people are worried about Asian carp. Asian carp are fish that are
native to Asia. Some of them were brought to the United States in the 1970s. They got
loose in the Mississippi River. Now, they are spreading like wildfire. The carp are not
just in the Mississippi River. They have also been found in other rivers that feed into
the Mississippi. People are worried that they may get into the Great Lakes.


10 Asian carp are big eaters. They gobble up food that other fish need. The carp get so big
that other fish can’t eat them. So, the arrival of Asian carp is bad news for other fish.


11 Asian carp are dangerous in another way, too. They are amazing jumpers. An Asian
carp can jump eight to ten feet in the air.


12 Asian carp tend to be scared by boats. If you drive a motorboat past them, they may
start to jump out of the water. You may see hundreds of flying fish. You may even be
hit with a fish. A number of people have been injured by these jumping fish.

13 Invasive species, like the Burmese python and Asian carp, can harm environments
they invade. Animals and plants suffer and some of the damage caused by these
invasive species may be permanent.

**The Elephant and the Ape**


“Look at me!” cried Tusk the elephant. “See how big and strong I am!” 14


“Look at me!” cried his friend Nim the ape. “See how quick and clever I am!” 30


“It is better to be big and strong than quick and clever!” said Tusk. 44


“Not so,” answered Nim. “It is better to be quick and clever than big and strong.” 60


So the two friends began to argue. 67


“Let’s not argue,” said Nim. “Let’s go to Sage and ask him to settle the matter.” 83


“Agreed!” said Tusk and off they ran. 90


Sage was a wise old owl who lived in the darkest corner of an old tower. 106


Sage listened to what Tusk and Nim had to say. 116


“I see,” he said. “There is a way to settle this. You must do just as I say. Then, I shall 137

tell you which is better.” 142


“Agreed!” said Tusk. 145


“Agreed!” said Nim. 148


“Cross the river,” said Sage, “and pick me some of the mangoes that grow on the 164

great tree.” 166


Tusk and Nim set off on their mission. 174


Soon, they came to the river, which was very wide and deep. Nim was afraid. 189


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **159**


“I can’t cross that river!” he cried. “Let’s go back.” 199


Tusk laughed. “Didn’t I tell you it is better to be big and strong than to be quick and 218

clever? It is an easy thing for me to cross the river.” 230


Tusk lifted Nim up with his trunk and put him on his broad back. Then, he swam 247

across the river. 250


Soon, they came to the mango tree. It was so tall that Tusk could not reach the 267

mangoes, even with his long trunk. He tried to knock the tree over but could not do it. 285


“I can’t reach the mangoes,” he said. “The tree is too high. We shall have to go back 303

without the mangoes.” 306


Nim laughed. “Didn’t I tell you it is better to be quick and clever than big and strong? 324

It is an easy thing for me to climb this tree.” 335


Nim scampered up the tree and tossed down a whole basketful of ripe mangoes. Tusk 350

picked them up. Then, the two of them crossed the river as before. 363


When they came again to Sage’s tower, Tusk said, “Here are your mangoes. Now tell us 379

which is better—to be big and strong or to be quick and clever?” 393


Sage answered, “I should think you would know that yourself. You crossed the river, 407

and Nim gathered the fruit. Sometimes it is better to be big and strong and sometimes it is 425

better to be quick and clever. Each thing in its place is best.” 438


“That is true,” answered Tusk. 443


“Indeed it is,” said Nim. 448


Then, away they went, and from that day on, they were better friends than ever before. 464

_**Stickeen: The Story of a Dog**_

_John Muir (1838–1914) was a naturalist and early environmentalist who argued for_
_preserving vast areas of American wilderness. He was one of the first European-Americans_
_to explore Alaska, and it was during one of these excursions that he met Stickeen, the dog_
_about whom he wrote this personal narrative._

_During Muir’s lifetime, many people referred to Native Americans as Indians. Although_
_today people consider the term “Indians” disrespectful to Native Americans, Muir does not_
_mean disrespect when he uses the term. Because his narrative is a true first-person account_
_written in a different time, he uses the language of the time._


_**Stickeen**_ **by John Muir**

In the summer of 1880 I set out from Fort Wrangel in a canoe to continue the

exploration of the icy region of southeastern Alaska, begun in the fall of 1879. After the

necessary **provisions**, blankets, etc., had been collected and stowed away, and my Indian

crew were in their places ready to start, while a crowd of their relatives and friends on

the wharf were bidding them good-bye and good-luck, my companion, the Rev. S.H.

Young, for whom we were waiting, at last came aboard, followed by a little black dog, that

immediately made himself at home by curling up in a hollow among the baggage. I like

dogs, but this one seemed so small and worthless that I objected to his going, and asked

the **missionary** why he was taking him.

“Such a little helpless creature will only be in the way,” I said; “you had better pass him

up to the Indian boys on the wharf, to be taken home to play with the children. This trip is

not likely to be good for toy-dogs. The poor silly thing will be in rain and snow for weeks

or months, and will require care like a baby.”

But his master assured me that he would be no trouble at all; that he was a perfect

wonder of a dog, could endure cold and hunger like a bear, swim like a seal, and was

**wondrous** wise and cunning, etc., making out a list of **virtues** to show he might be the

most interesting member of the party.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **177**


Nobody could hope to unravel the lines of his ancestry. In all the wonderfully mixed

and varied dog-tribe I never saw any creature very much like him, though in some of his

sly, soft, gliding motions and gestures he brought the fox to mind. He was short-legged

and bunchy-bodied, and his hair, though smooth, was long and silky and slightly waved,

so that when the wind was at his back it ruffled, making him look shaggy. At first sight his

only noticeable feature was his fine tail, which was about as airy and shady as a squirrel’s,

and was carried curling forward almost to his nose. On closer inspection you might notice

his thin sensitive ears, and sharp eyes with cunning tan-spots above them. Mr. Young told

me that when the little fellow was a pup about the size of a woodrat he was presented to

his wife by an Irish **prospector** at Sitka, and that on his arrival at Fort Wrangel he was

adopted with enthusiasm by the Stickeen Indians as a sort of new good-luck totem, was

named “Stickeen” for the tribe, and became a universal favorite; petted, protected, and

admired wherever he went, and regarded as a mysterious fountain of wisdom.

On our trip he soon proved himself a queer character—odd, concealed, independent,

keeping invincibly quiet, and doing many little puzzling things that piqued my curiosity.

As we sailed week after week through the long **intricate** channels and inlets among

the innumerable islands and mountains of the coast, he spent most of the dull days

in **sluggish** ease, motionless, and apparently as unobserving as if in deep sleep. But I

discovered that somehow he always knew what was going on. When the Indians were

about to hunt for dinner, or when anything along the shore was exciting our attention,

he would rest his chin on the edge of the canoe and calmly look out like a dreamy-eyed

tourist. And when he heard us talking about making a landing, he immediately **roused**

himself to see what sort of a place we were coming to, and made ready to jump overboard

and swim ashore as soon as the canoe neared the beach. Then, with a **vigorous** shake to

get rid of the brine in his hair, he ran into the woods to hunt small game.


Note: This text contains archaic/old language and includes words that may have been commonplace at the time but are not used in the same context we
use today. For example, the word “queer” is used in the text which meant strange or odd. The meaning of these words can change over time and are not
used in the same way today.

But though always the first out of the canoe, he was always the last to get into it.

When we were ready to start he could never be found, and refused to come to our call.

We soon found out, however, that though we could not see him at such times, he saw us,

and from the cover of the briers and huckleberry bushes in the **fringe** of the woods was

watching the canoe with **wary** eye. For as soon as we were fairly off he came trotting down

the beach, plunged into the surf, and swam after us, knowing well that we would cease

rowing and take him in. When the **contrary** little **vagabond** came alongside, he was lifted

by the neck, held at arm’s length a moment to drip, and dropped aboard. We tried to cure

him of this trick by **compelling** him to swim a long way, as if we had a mind to abandon

him; but this did no good: the longer the swim the better he seemed to like it.

Though capable of great **idleness**, he never failed to be ready for all sorts of

adventures and excursions. One pitch-dark rainy night we landed about ten o’clock at

the mouth of a salmon stream when the water was **phosphorescent** . The salmon were

running, and the myriad fins of the onrushing multitude were churning all the stream into

a silvery glow, wonderfully beautiful and impressive in the **ebon** darkness. To get a good

view of the show I set out with one of the Indians and sailed up through the midst of it to

the foot of a rapid about half a mile from camp, where the swift current dashing over rocks

made the **luminous** glow most glorious. Happening to look back down the stream, while

the Indian was catching a few of the struggling fish, I saw a long spreading fan of light like

the tail of a comet, which we thought must be made by some big strange animal that was

pursuing us. On it came with its magnificent train, until we imagined we could see the

monster’s head and eyes; but it was only Stickeen, who, finding I had left the camp, came

swimming after me to see what was up.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 1** **179**


When we camped early, the best hunter of the crew usually went to the woods for a

deer, and Stickeen was sure to be at his heels, provided I had not gone out. For, strange

to say, he always followed me, forsaking the hunter and even his master to share my

wanderings. The days that were too stormy for sailing I spent in the woods, or on the

adjacent mountains, wherever my studies called me; and Stickeen always insisted on

going with me, however wild the weather, gliding like a fox through dripping huckleberry

bushes and thorny tangles of panax and rubus, scarce stirring their rain-laden leaves;

wading and wallowing through snow, swimming icy streams, skipping over logs and

rocks and the crevasses of glaciers with the patience and **endurance** of a determined

**mountaineer**, never tiring or getting discouraged. Once he followed me over a glacier the

surface of which was so crusty and rough that it cut his feet until every step was marked

with blood; but he trotted on with Indian fortitude until I noticed his red track, and,

taking pity on him, made him a set of moccasins out of a handkerchief. However great

his troubles he never asked help or made any complaint, as if, like a philosopher, he had

learned that without hard work and suffering there could be no pleasure worth having.
