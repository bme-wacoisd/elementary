unusual name
for a historical
period—
especially one

as you and I do today. In
fact, the Middle Ages was
not a phrase used by the people who lived during that time period. It is
a term modern historians use today to refer to that time period between
ancient and modern times.


**1**


We begin our journey into **medieval** Europe—another name for
the Middle Ages—by examining some key events that happened long
before this age began. The first major event that helped to **transform**
western Europe occurred when the mighty Roman **Empire**, having
grown too big for one emperor to rule, broke apart into the eastern
and western parts of the empire. This division had a major impact on
western Europe. With the Roman Empire split into two parts, different
tribes took the opportunity to **seize** some of its lands. Interestingly,
some of these people were given the name _barbarian_ from the Latin
word _barbarus_, meaning foreigner, or not Roman. The Romans may
have considered these people to be uncivilized because they did not

were Germanic
tribes, such as
the Franks, the
Visigoths, and the


**3**


As warlike tribes swept across western Europe, and powerful kings
emerged, another transforming force appeared—the Christian Church.
Throughout these years of change, many people turned to the Church
because it offered them a sense of stability and hope. The heart, or
center, of the Church was in Rome, the seat of the **papacy** . Slowly, more
and more groups of people became Christians, including the Germanic
tribes. Over time, the Church became even richer and more powerful
than many kings and queens.


It is this time—when the Roman Empire was no longer the only
powerful force in Europe—that many historians consider to be the start
of the Middle Ages. Roman, Germanic, and Christian ideas, as well as
powerful kings, began to shape western Europe.


In one of the Germanic regions, a great ruler emerged. His name
was Charles, and he took control of much of the land that later became
France. Charles ruled for more than 45 years. He increased the size of his
empire by gaining land in areas that are now part of Germany, Austria,
Italy, and Spain. As king, Charles defended the authority of the Church.
He promoted the spread of Christianity. On Christmas Day, in 800 AD,
he was crowned Roman Emperor by the Pope in Rome. His reputation
was so great that, later, writers called him Charlemagne, which means
“Charles the Great.”


**Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne Roman Emperor in 800 AD.**


**4**


Charles encouraged new ideas and promoted an interest in
education and art. To help him rule his empire, Charlemagne also
encouraged a system of government that we now call feudalism. He
gave land, instead of money, to those who worked for him in the
military or government. The practice of paying men with land spread
throughout other countries in western Europe.


Life in the Middle Ages was not the same as it is now. For one
thing, people who lived back then probably thought about time
differently. Many people measured time by the rising and

In addition, there was a strong desire to honor
God that appeared to transcend time. As a
result, people undertook impressive, longterm projects such as building magnificent
cathedrals that took centuries to complete.


Language and location helped shape

people’s lives, too. Because travel was so

**years to complete.**

difficult, many people didn’t do it. Generally,
only rich, educated people in Europe traveled. Almost everyone
else stayed close to home. Although Latin was the language of both
the Church and government, only select members of society could
understand that language. Most people lived an isolated existence. They
did not travel far from home. As a result, most people communicated
using the language, or dialect, spoken in the place of their birth. As
strange as it may seem to us, in certain parts of Europe villagers from
places just 30 miles apart could not easily understand each other. For
this reason, most people during the Middle Ages were concerned with
the affairs of their village, what they owed the local lord in the way of
payment, and how to ensure their place in heaven.

**Although this diagram does not include every aspect of medieval feudal**
**society, it does show the people with the most power at the top, and the**
**people with the least power at the bottom.**



**6**


There was another force that had a huge impact on western
European society during the Middle Ages. This force came in the form
of a deadly disease. The disease,
called the Black Death, or plague,
certainly made its mark upon
medieval Europe. This dreadful
plague first appeared in the 500s.
In the second half of the 1300s
it swept through Europe once
again. Spread by infected fleas that
lived on rodents, the Black Death
probably killed one-third of the
population of western Europe.


Despite conflicts and hardships, this
period in history was also a time when people
created impressive and inspiring architecture.
Great castles and churches began to adorn
the landscape. Kings, queens, and **noblemen**
held jousts, and court jesters entertained
noble families.


In the Reader for this Unit, you will discover what it was like to
work on the land for the local lord. You will learn about what life was
like in the incredibly crowded towns of the Middle Ages. You will
wander through a castle and find out how young men trained to be
knights. Are you ready to explore this fascinating time in history?

If you lived during the Middle Ages,
your life followed one of a few set paths. If
you were the child of a king and a queen
or a **lord** and a **lady**, you lived a **privileged**
life. You had enough food to eat and
clothes to wear. You lived in a relatively
nice house. You had servants, too. You may
have been one of the few who learned to
read and write. You even learned to ride
a horse. If you were a boy, you learned to
become a skilled swordsman. Privileged
girls may have learned to embroider, to **Privileged family**
dance, and to play a musical instrument. **in the Middle Ages**
Occasionally girls, too, learned to read.
As a privileged child, you likely grew up to become a king or a queen,
or a lord or a lady, yourself.


But most people in the Middle Ages were not privileged. In the
early Middle Ages, nearly everyone in Europe worked on the land. Most
farmworkers were called serfs. Serfs grew the food and tended to the
livestock, or animals, that fed the people. Some had more freedom than
others and were called freemen. Serfs were at the bottom of the social
order and had the least amount of power.


**9**


Serfs usually spent their entire lives working on a landowner’s or
lord’s estate. In return for the work they did, the lord allowed serfs to
use some of the land to grow their own food. The lord lived in his castle
or manor house. He owned all the land around his home and often
the nearby towns and villages, too. The lord also controlled the lives of
most of the people who worked for him.


**Serfs worked on the land throughout the year.**


Serfs were not educated. They did not learn to read or write. If
serfs wanted to travel to a nearby town, they needed permission from
the lord. When serfs wanted to marry, the lord had the right to approve
or disapprove of the match. When serfs had children, those children
usually grew up to work as serfs for the same lord.


**10**


In the Middle Ages, serfs worked on farmland that was divided
into strips. The serfs spent about half of their time working for the lord.
The rest of the time, they worked on the strips of land where their own
crops were grown.


Most serfs lived in small, simple houses in or near a village. Their
houses were made from wood and mud. The roofs were thatched,
meaning they were made from rushes, or straw. They usually had just
one room. Serfs slept on straw beds. Inside each house was a small
fireplace for cooking. Smoke from the fire escaped through a hole in
the roof.


The lord increased his wealth in many different ways. In addition
to working the farmland for the lord, serfs paid taxes to the lord in the
form of money, crops, and livestock. Sometimes the lord ran a mill and
even charged his serfs a fee to grind their grain into flour.


**11**


to the aid of his serfs. Even when food supplies were low, serfs were not
allowed to hunt in the lord’s forests. However, to avoid starving, people
sometimes hunted illegally. This was called poaching, and serfs who
were caught poaching were severely punished.


Some farmworkers were freemen. Freemen were not under the
same strict control of the lord. If a serf ran away from his home, and
managed to live for a year and a day in a town without being found, he
could become a freeman, too.


The Middle Ages was a violent time compared to how we live
today. There were frequent wars and uprisings, including rebellions
against the king by **rival** nobles. The need for armed protection shaped
medieval society. Usually, high-ranking nobles swore their loyalty to the
king and lords swore their loyalty to higher-ranking nobles. Freemen
and serfs had to be **loyal** to their lord. In exchange for their loyalty,

A good harvest makes everyone,
especially the lord, very happy. It
means there is food to eat during
the winter months. A good
harvest is a time of celebration
for all.


Nevertheless, you have to
get used to having less food to eat
in the wintertime, and to feeling
hungry and cold more often than
not. At times, your parents find
it difficult to make ends meet.

## **Knights**





Whether rich or poor, young men in the Middle Ages learned how
to use a weapon of some kind. Rivalries between nobles, wars with
other nations, even violence between neighbors required that they be
able to fight. When a lord needed to raise an army, he turned to those
he governed.


In the Middle Ages, ordinary foot soldiers were trained to fight
with an axe and a long spear called a pike. Others were trained to be
skillful archers and crossbowmen. Some foot soldiers might have worn
chainmail, an early form of metal **armor**, but most had padded coats
and carried daggers. However, the most **esteemed** soldiers were knights.


**17**


you wanted to be a knight, you had to be able to afford horses and armor.
You also had to find someone willing to train you. Because it was very
expensive to become a knight, these mounted warriors were usually sons
of wealthy, **influential** members of society.


Being a knight was one way of making a fortune. If you were
involved in successful battles and wars, you might receive money or land
as payment for your services. Sometimes a king might also reward you
with a **title** . Having a title usually meant that you were an influential
member of society. Knights also made money by looting and by holding
certain people for **ransom** .


**18**


**Young boy training to be a knight**



Your training to become a
knight begins at a young age. You
leave home to live with a family
friend or relative who has agreed
to train you. In the first several
years of your training, you help to
dress and to serve the lord. You are
known as a page. During these early
years as an **aspiring** knight, you
probably learn to use a sword, to
ride a horse, and to wield a lance, or
long wooden pole with a metal tip.
Later, when you are ready to learn
more challenging skills, you become
a squire.



Although you
are still a servant, as
a squire you are now
responsible for grooming
and saddling the lord’s
horses. You are also
responsible for cleaning
and polishing his armor.
You learn how to fight
while riding a horse.
You learn to use other
weapons, including a
heavier lance. This part
of your training lasts for



**19**


If you are a successful
squire, you might be
knighted by the lord. In
what is called the dubbing
ceremony, the lord taps you
on the shoulder with the flat
part of his sword. Then, a
priest might bless you with
a prayer.

**King knighting a squire**

~~**The Way of the Knight**~~



In France in the 1100s and 1200s,
certain expectations about how knights
should behave in society were developed.
The term **chivalry**, which refers to a
warrior horseman or knight, became the
term used to describe these expectations.
These ideas of chivalry spread to other
European countries. Knights were

**Knights were supposed**
**to be brave in battle.** expected to

serve their
lord. They were required to honor and
protect the Church and weaker members
of society. They were also expected to
treat other knights captured in battle
as honored guests until a ransom was
received. Sometimes it took months
before a captured knight’s family paid
up. Once payment was received, the

~~**Charge!**~~

Knights could prove
their strength and abilities
by taking part in jousting
matches. Jousting matches
were mock, or pretend, battles
between two or more knights.
Knights rode horses, wore
full armor, and carried lances.
Those who took part in jousts
did so to gain respect and
possibly a generous prize.
For the privileged, attending
the jousting matches was

**Jousting was a popular sport.**

considered to be a day of
excitement and entertainment. It was very much like watching a
football or baseball game today. When the joust began, the knights
charged at each other. With the aid of a lance, each knight attempted
to knock his opponent off his horse.

**Cold, Dark, and Gloomy**

Many kings and nobles lived in castles.
Castles provided the inhabitants, or people
who lived there, with a certain amount of
protection from the enemy. They were also
fairly safe places to store weapons and food
supplies. The first castles were wooden forts.
Later, people built stronger castles made
of stone.



**Modern reconstruction of**
**wooden castle**



Castle walls sometimes **enclosed** a
series of small buildings, like a little town.
The castle had a water supply within the
walls. Residents also needed a good supply
of food inside so they could withstand a
**siege** . For added protection, some castles

**Stone castle in France** were surrounded by moats. The moat

was a deep trench, often filled with water.
Sometimes there was a drawbridge that could be raised or lowered.
Over time, castles became more elaborate with interior courtyards,
living quarters for soldiers, and stables.


By today’s standards, life in a castle was not very pleasant. Castles
were cold and gloomy. They were designed for protection, not comfort.
Most castles had only a few rooms. There was typically a Great Hall,
a kitchen, and two or three private
chambers, or rooms, for the lord and
his family. There was no bathroom, just
a tiny alcove that jutted out of the castle
wall. The contents of the toilet emptied
into the moat or a pit directly below.
Can you imagine the smell? **Castle in England with moat**

**A castle’s Great Hall had many uses.**

The Great Hall was where family members and their guests
gathered. Meals were served in the Great Hall. Entertainers performed
there, and guests and even servants slept there. Buckets of hot coals
or fireplaces provided the fire needed for heat and cooking. Small
windows and candles offered little light.


Traveling storytellers, minstrels,
and troupes of actors often visited a
castle. Quite often, jesters lived in the
castle, ready to perform whenever
requested. Noble children and adults
in the Middle Ages enjoyed music and
dancing. They played outdoor sports
as well. Tennis, croquet, and bowling
all began as lawn games during this
period in history. **Medieval musicians**

_rats scurrying about, feeding on discarded trash. Nearby, you hear the_

during

**27**


**Streets in medieval towns were often crowded and muddy.**


**28**


In the early part of the Middle
Ages, most people lived in the
countryside. Between the years
1000 and 1350 AD, **fueled** by
trade, towns began to grow. New
jobs **emerged**, and, as a result,
more and more people left the
countryside to live and work
in towns.



**Peasants farming in the countryside**



With this growth in trade, an increased number of people became
involved in commerce, or business. As a result, a class of people, called
the middle class, grew in importance. **Merchants** and craftsmen were

part of the middle class.
Towns grew as the middle
class created successful
businesses, and therefore
jobs. Some merchants
became rich and
influential members
of town communities.


To protect their
businesses, merchants
established guilds in
towns throughout Europe.
Guilds were organizations
made up of merchants.
Guilds controlled wages
as well as the price and
quality of the goods the

There was a certain pattern to daily life in towns in the Middle

Ages. From Monday to
Saturday, towns were busy
with the **hustle and bustle** of
street vendors, shopkeepers,
craftsmen, and market sellers.
Shops opened as early as 6:00
a.m. Most towns held markets
two or three times a week.
Local farmers sold produce and
animals.

**Town scene in medieval manuscript**


**30**


With a growing economy,
a banking system began to
develop. The increasingly
wealthy churches in towns
created schools called
universities. Places such as
Oxford and Cambridge in
England, and Paris in France,
became important centers
of learning.

**31**


It was not long before many European towns and cities became
terribly overcrowded. People lived in small houses crowded together.

The towns and cities were also diseaseridden. Rats scurrying about helped
spread disease. Unless you lived in a
castle, you did not have a toilet inside
your home. Instead, people used
chamber pots and threw the contents
into the streets!

common. The Black Death spread easily in
such conditions.


As they did in the countryside, people in

Fires frequently broke out and were difficult
to control. Townspeople were required to keep
buckets of water outside their homes—just
in case.


Many Middle Age towns were walled.
People entering or leaving did so through
gates. Often a toll, or fee, was charged to enter
a town. A toll collector stood at the gate to **Fires spread quickly in**

collect the fee. The tolls were either paid in
money or in goods. Gates were designed to keep criminals out, or if
necessary, to lock criminals in so that they could be caught. There
was no organized police force, but instead there were watchmen. Any
member of the public could be asked to help catch an escaping criminal.
The town gates were locked at night when the **curfew** bell sounded.

that it was time to go home.

**If You Were an Apprentice Craftsman**



Just like the boys
who go off to train
to be knights, you,
too, are sent away at
an early age. Your
family arranges your
training. You must
live in the home of
a master, or highly
skilled, craftsman. It
is unlikely that you
will return home
again during your
**apprenticeship** years.



**Apprentice blacksmith assisting his master**



**33**


Your training will take
many years to complete. You
will not receive payment for
any of the work you do. During
this time, you are part of your
master’s household. You live in
his home or shop. You usually
eat with his family. Your new
family provides the clothes you
wear. Even if you are homesick,
or sad, you have to obey your
master.


After a specified period of
time, you advance from being

**for his master.** an apprentice to becoming a

journeyman. As a journeyman,
you are paid by your master
each day for your work. Usually,
you continue to work for your
master as an employee. After
several years as an employee,
you might take the next step in
your career. You might be ready
to submit a piece of your best
work, called your masterpiece,
to the guild for approval. If
the guild accepts your work,
you finally become a master
craftsman. You might even be
able to open your own shop with

**own shop.**


**34**


~~**Women in the Middle Ages**~~

Women in the Middle Ages had few legal rights. However,
a small number of women in positions of power had significant
influence. For example, women who became queens were often in a
position to **advise** their husbands and sons, the kings and princes.
A lord’s widow who did not have sons could manage her deceased
husband’s land and make important decisions. Women could become
skilled in a particular craft, and some trained to be merchants. Other
women joined the Church and became nuns. Many women worked
alongside their husbands in the fields. Regardless of whether they

managed their families’ daily needs.



Two interesting women from this time
period were Empress Matilda and Abbess
Hildegard of Bingen. Empress Matilda lived
during the 1100s and was the daughter of
King Henry I of England. She was

She was also the mother of King Henry II
of England.


Abbess Hildegard was a writer and

wrote about many different subjects, including
philosophy, science, and medicine. She also

It may be impossible for us to understand just how important
the Christian Church was to most Europeans in the Middle Ages. Not
only did the local lords have great influence over people’s lives, but the
Church did, too. The power of the Church had grown gradually over a
long period of time.

who spoke Latin. Finally, in 1054 AD, the
two sides split over differing beliefs. The eastern Church was called
Orthodox. Members of the Orthodox Church thought their beliefs
were orthodox, or correct. The western Church, based in Rome, was
called Catholic. Members of the Catholic Church thought their beliefs
were catholic, or universal. The two Christian Churches that emerged

his followers. People did not work on these days, but instead went to
church. Some holy days were feast days and other holy days were days
of **fasting** . Christmas, an important Christian holiday, was a time of
feasting, or celebration. The 40 days
before Easter, another Christian holiday,
were a time of fasting called Lent.













Architects and craftsmen in the
Middle Ages built beautiful churches
to express their love for God. New
engineering skills enabled stonemasons
to create a style of architecture that
later became known as Gothic. They
built tall towers, arches, **rose windows**,
and **spires** . Sometimes it took
hundreds of years to complete a great
medieval cathedral.

Holy shrines dedicated to people who played an important role in
the history of Christianity were scattered across western Europe. These
shrines were usually places where religious figures had been killed

or buried, or where miracles were believed

or **pilgrimage**, to visit one of these
shrines in their lifetime. For many,
going on a pilgrimage meant
walking or riding long distances,
and eating and sleeping in roadside
taverns or religious houses. Many
men and women made the journey
to fulfill a vow to God, to seek a
cure for a disease, or just to

Monks were men who chose to live apart from society and to
**devote** their lives to the Church. They spent their lives in monasteries,
working on the land, studying, and praying. Monks were often the most
educated people in Europe, especially in the early part of the Middle
Ages. A monastery was a building, or collection of buildings, that
housed monks.
Monasteries
were usually
contained
within high
walls that
provided a
certain amount
of protection.

**Sénanque Abbey in Provence, France, was founded in 1148 AD.**


**40**


Women also joined the Church.
Women who devoted their lives to the
Church were called nuns. Nuns lived in
convents, or nunneries. Nuns received
many of the same benefits as monks. They
were educated and were taught crafts and
other skills.


As the Church grew in power and
influence, it became very wealthy. The
Church raised taxes and it owned land.
People who held powerful positions within

families. They gave large amounts of money
to the Church. The Church also influenced
political decisions and supported or opposed kings.


Not only powerful people gave
money to the Church. All Christians
were required to pay one-tenth of
their earnings to the Church. This
payment was known as a tithe.


However, there was a troubling
side to this deeply religious period
in history. Some people expressed
ideas with which the pope and
other Church leaders disagreed.
Church leaders called these
contradictory opinions heresy,
and the people who held them
were called heretics. Heretics were

By copying these texts, monks and nuns
helped to preserve, or save, ancient
knowledge that would otherwise have

In the late Middle Ages, the higher social classes who could
read, and even write, owned their own prayer books, such as the
_Book of Hours._ These prayer books were read at different times of
the day. In addition to prayers, the books included biblical texts,
calendars, hymns, and
painted pictures.



Many of the books produced
by monks and nuns contained
**exquisite** art and design features.
After the Middle Ages, as a
result of Johannes Gutenberg’s
invention of the printing
press around 1450 AD, more
affordable books were produced.
These printed books began to
replace the beautiful handmade
books and made these original
manuscripts even more rare.

_It is October 14, in the year 1066 AD, near the small coastal town_
_of Hastings, England. At the top of a rolling hill known as Senlac Hill,_
_thousands of foot soldiers stood in a line. At around 9:00 a.m. on this_
_autumn day hundreds of years ago, English soldiers prepared to battle_
_an invading army. What happened next changed the course of_
_English history._


**The English soldiers formed** The English soldiers, led by their
**a shield wall at the top of** king, Harold, stood at least 7,000 strong.
**Senlac Hill.**

However, these brave and loyal soldiers
had recently marched about 200 miles. They came from the north of
England where they had already fought an invading force. Though
victorious, these soldiers were tired.


As they stood on the hill, the English soldiers could see that they
faced a large, well-equipped Norman army. The Normans, who came
from a region of France, had approximately 10,000 men. They had
thousands of skilled archers. They also had thousands of foot soldiers
and knights who fought on horseback. The English, however, had
mostly foot soldiers armed with simple weapons, such as bows and
arrows, axes, spears, swords, and daggers.


Nevertheless, the English line was strong. What they lacked in
energy, they made up for in **determination** . They stood with their

English soldiers left their positions
on Senlac Hill, they encountered
Norman knights on horseback. The
knights surrounded them. Then
King Harold was killed. Although
the English soldiers fought bravely,
the Norman knights charged up
the hill. Without a strong defensive
line, the Norman knights were able
to overwhelm the English soldiers.
What was ultimately an eight-hour
bloody battle ended with a Norman
victory. The Duke of Normandy and
his army had defeated the English.

Although victorious, William could not yet pronounce himself
king. He and his soldiers began to march to the capital city of London.
They chose to follow the old Roman road to London. Along the way,
William met little **resistance** until he reached the capital.

On Christmas Day in Westminster
Abbey, in the year 1066 AD, the Norman
duke was crowned King William I of
England. From that moment
on, he became known as William
the Conqueror.


Why did the Battle of Hastings take
place? It took place because Harold and
William each believed he was the true
king of England. There could be only one
victor, and, in the end, it was William. **William as king**


**50**


About 20 years after the Battle of Hastings, William decided that
he wanted to know how rich England was. He wanted to know how
much money people had in order to determine what taxes he could
collect. William ordered officials from different counties to ride out
across the land to find out. Although these men did not visit every
location, or record every piece of property, they did collect a lot of
information. They sent the information to the king’s clerks who
recorded it in two books. These books later became known as _Great_
_Domesday_ and _Little Domesday_ . Today we simply refer to these books

**Bayeux Tapestry**

The Bayeux Tapestry is a medieval embroidered cloth that tells
the story of the Norman Conquest. The story is told in Latin text and
beautiful images that were embroidered onto 231 feet of linen cloth. The
Bayeux Tapestry is believed to have been **commissioned** around the year
1075 AD by a member of William’s family. Much of what we know about
the Battle of Hastings is because of this extraordinary tapestry.

Over time, these languages were blended together and became
what is called Middle English. In the 1300s, Chaucer wrote _The_
_Canterbury Tales_ in Middle English. If William had not defeated
King Harold, we might be speaking a different language!

that all castles built without royal approval
be torn down. He also imposed a tax on
the nobles. This tax, known as the shield
tax, had been used before by Henry I.
Instead of asking the nobles to provide
soldiers for his army, the king asked for
money. With this money, Henry II

By the time he died in 1189 AD, Henry II had done a lot to **restore** the
power and authority of the English monarchy.

**Murder in the Cathedral**

In the beginning of his **reign**,
Henry II **appointed** a man he trusted
named Thomas Becket to be his chief
advisor. As well as controlling the
nobles, Henry also wanted to limit
the power of the Church in England.
To help him do this, he appointed
Thomas to the position of archbishop
of Canterbury. This meant that Thomas
had become the most powerful Church

**Thomas Becket, Archbishop** leader in all of England. Henry was
**of Canterbury**

confident that his friend would support
his decisions regarding the Church.


But things did
not work out that way.
Thomas took his new
job very seriously. When
Henry wanted to reduce
the power of the Church
courts, Thomas disagreed
with him. Furious, Henry
thought about having his
friend arrested. However,
before this could happen,
Thomas escaped to **Henry II and Becket arguing**
France. The pope
supported Thomas and threatened to excommunicate, or remove,
Henry from the Church. In the Middle Ages, excommunication was
a terrifying prospect. Many Christians believed that if they were
excommunicated from the Church, they would not go to heaven.


**60**


Eventually, Henry
and Thomas reached
an agreement and
Thomas was allowed
to return to England.
Henry and Thomas’s
relationship did not
improve, though. They
continued to argue over
Church matters. Henry
became so frustrated **Knights murdering Becket in Canterbury Cathedral**
that during a royal
dinner, with many nobles in attendance, he is said to have uttered the
words, “Will no one rid me of this troublesome priest?”


Was Henry just **sulking**, or was he encouraging the **assassination**
of Thomas? We will never know for sure. Four knights who heard
these words murdered the archbishop while he was kneeling in prayer

in Canterbury Cathedral. These
knights may not have set out to kill
the archbishop. The reasons behind
the murder of Thomas Becket are
still a mystery.


Three years after Thomas’s
death, the pope declared him to be
a saint. Thomas Becket’s tomb in
Canterbury Cathedral became a holy
shrine that many **pilgrims** visited
during the Middle Ages. It is said that
Henry never forgave himself for the
death of his friend.
**Canterbury Cathedral**

**A Most Extraordinary Queen**

In 1153 AD,
Henry II married a
woman named Eleanor
of Aquitaine. Eleanor
came from a noble
family who controlled
Aquitaine, one of the
richest regions of France.
She had been married
previously to the king
of France. Henry and
Eleanor had eight
children. In 1173 AD,
two of their sons plotted


the plot to overthrow him, so he had her
placed under house arrest. When Henry
died in 1189 AD, Eleanor was released
by her oldest son, Richard I. Richard was
crowned king after the death of his father,
Henry II. Eleanor helped to govern
England during the years King Richard
was away fighting in the wars known as
the Crusades. Because he was so brave,
Richard earned the name _Lion–Hearted_ .
Eleanor of Aquitaine is thought to have

**Eleanor of Aquitaine’s seal** her time.

~~**The Crusades**~~



A series of wars that
became known as the
Crusades helped to define
and shape the Middle Ages.
The origin of these wars
began in 638 AD when
Arab armies captured the
holy city of Jerusalem.
Despite this conquest,
Jerusalem remained open
to travelers, traders, and
pilgrims. The city was, after

**Pope Urban II encouraged the First Crusade at** all, sacred to Jews, Muslims,
**the Council of Clermont in 1095 AD.** and Christians. Over time,

Arab armies were conquered by Turkish armies, and access to Jerusalem
became harder for Jewish and Christian pilgrims. In 1095 AD, the pope
commanded that the Christian kings of Europe raise an army to reclaim

and 1291 AD, there were nine crusades, or
attempts to recapture Jerusalem. On their
way to the holy city, crusaders sometimes
killed Muslims and Jews. Despite the
violence, trading relationships developed
between Europe and the Middle East. In

**The Journey of a Crusader**

Many crusaders left their homes in Europe and traveled to



across land and
sea. Many of the
places crusaders
passed through
had climates very
different from their
native Europe.
Diseases were
also common
along the route.
Crusaders often

that Jerusalem should only be
controlled by Christians. When
the Pope began the Crusades
to take Jersualem from the
Muslims who ruled there at
the time, many crusaders came
to believe that they were given
permission to persecute and kill
non-Christians. Unfortunately,
this happened to many Jewish

##### **King John and the Magna Carta**





King Richard I died in 1199 AD. Although
he had spent very little time in England, people
there still mourned the death of Richard the
Lion-Hearted. Many people had taken up
arms and followed this royal crusader to the
hot deserts of the Middle East. Many fought
alongside him in battle. Without children to

Wars cost money and someone had to pay
for them. To do this, King John raised taxes.
He taxed nobles and wealthy merchants, and
he placed taxes on cities. He also made it more
difficult for people to hunt in the royal forests.
Dissatisfaction with King John grew among the
ruling class.


Then, King John claimed Church property
and disagreed with the pope’s choice of who

**King John holding model** should become the archbishop of Canterbury.

pope was so angry with King John that he

were prevented from participating in the daily and weekly rituals of the


As a result of the feudal system, nobles had a huge amount of
power. King John wanted to lessen their power and claim some of their
land. The nobles wanted to limit the king’s authority. A major conflict
was **inevitable** .


Eventually, King John agreed to the pope’s candidate for archbishop
of Canterbury. But by this time, some of the more powerful nobles
had already decided to act against him. In 1215 AD, following another

1215 AD,
an official seal
was placed on Magna Carta. Copies of Magna Carta were sent out to
different parts of the kingdom. Magna Carta was an important written
statement that limited the power of English kings.


**70**


**Magna Carta**

Magna Carta really only benefited some members of society:
feudal lords, the Church, the merchant class, and, in a general way, all
freemen. Still, the document stated that the king must consult with
others if he wanted to make new laws or raise taxes, and that courts
must recognize the rule of law. In this respect, it is considered to be
one of the most important documents in English history. Many of the
ideas in this document have been included in the constitutions—or
governing documents—of modern democracies.


King John did not have to endure this **humiliation** for too long.
Four months later, he died of a fever as conflict continued to rage
throughout England. King John’s son Henry was crowned king of this
troubled land. Henry III was just nine years old!


Within 50 years of King John’s death, England would have a new
governing body, or parliament. This parliament included the king, the
lords, the knights, and the townspeople in England, providing more
people a say in the government and laws.

~~**Robin Hood**~~

Did the English hero Robin Hood really exist? It is difficult to
say. The earliest reference to the legend of Robin Hood appears to
date from about 1377 AD, and the oldest manuscript is from the
late 1400s. The stories of Robin Hood’s adventures first appeared
in the form of **ballads** . As the legend goes, Robin and his band of
men lived in the forests of northern England. Robin was thought
to be a hero because he challenged the local lords, and even the
king. English kings had raised taxes and introduced strict hunting
laws, which prevented many people from entering royal forests. It
is possible that there really was an outlaw like Robin Hood who
challenged these laws. However, it is also possible that a fictional
character named Robin Hood was created by storytellers to explain

The Middle Ages lasted for more than a thousand years. Wars
occurred, kings and queens ruled, and a deadly disease killed
one-third of the population of Europe. People lived
their lives, seasons came and went, and history was
made. Those days are long gone, but the people
who lived long ago have touched our lives.
Many ideas, laws, inventions, and important
decisions made in the Middle Ages still affect
our lives today.


Certain key events helped define the Middle Ages. You have
already heard about many of them. The Hundred Years’ War is another.
This war began when one man claimed to be the true king of another

land. This time it was the English king,
Edward III, the great-great-grandson
of King John. He claimed to be the
rightful king of France.


The Hundred Years’ War was
not one war, but rather a series of
military **encounters** that began in
1337 and ended in 1453 AD. Between
the battles and sieges were **truces** and
**negotiations**, and periods of peace.

kingdom in Europe. People did not expect this war to last long. The
English, however, made good use of their skillful archers. Many of
these archers used longbows. This powerful weapon helped the English
archers defeat the French knights on the battlefields of France. One
good example was the famous battle of Agincourt. On October 25,
1415 AD, a **mighty** French army faced a much smaller English army.
The English archers with their longbows could not be overpowered by
the French soldiers.


Although this was **indeed** a great victory for the English, France
won the war in the end. They held onto almost all of the lands that the
English had hoped to control. Out of wars such as this one, a stronger
sense of nationalism developed. People fought and died for their king
and for the land they belonged to.


**78**


**Joan of Arc**


**Portrait of Joan of Arc from the 1400s**


When Joan was 13 years
old, she began to have visions
and to hear voices. Joan
believed that God was speaking
to her. These experiences
continued for several years.
When Joan was 17 years old, the
English burned her village of
Domrémy. Joan heard the voices
again. This time she believed
that God was telling her to lead
the soldiers of France to victory
against the English.



France won the Hundred
Years’ War. This might not have
happened if it had not been for
the bravery of a young girl. Her
name was Joan of Arc and this is
her story.


Joan was born into a peasant
family in eastern France in 1412
AD. She lived a simple life. She
did not go to school and never
learned to read or write. During
her childhood, the Hundred Years’
War was raging. The mighty
French army had not been able to
defeat the English. This war caused
hardship and poverty in France.


**Joan riding into battle**


**79**


Joan traveled
to a nearby town.
There she told
the governor of
the town that she
had a message
for the dauphin.
The dauphin was
next in line to the
French throne.
Incredibly, the
governor agreed

**Joan of Arc entering town of Orléans** to allow Joan

to speak to the

and some soldiers. She was able to free the town of Orléans from
English control and helped to ensure that the dauphin was crowned
King Charles VII.

**The Black Death**

Some historians have concluded that traders who had been trading
in the Middle East brought the plague to Europe. This first outbreak in
the 600s was the most terrible of all. It is estimated that at least onethird of the population of Europe died during this outbreak. The plague
existed throughout much of Europe, but it arrived in England in 1348
AD. This terrible disease created a sense of terror. It spread throughout
England and eventually made its way into Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.
Carried by infected fleas that lived on rodents, it spread quickly
through the dirty towns and cities. It affected every level of society.
Nobles as well as serfs were struck down by this terrible disease. The

The following account of the plague was written down by a man named

**All Kinds of Changes**

People fought wars differently by the end of the Middle Ages than
