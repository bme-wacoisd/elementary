**Opening:**


Thrown together by the happenstance of where they live and go to

school, a class of fourth graders has ten episodes to walk the path of

invention and emerge—maybe scarred, maybe stronger, but almost certainly

better inventors. This is the world of the reality game show Eureka!

Student Inventor—where puppets pull the strings and “making it work” is

only the beginning.
