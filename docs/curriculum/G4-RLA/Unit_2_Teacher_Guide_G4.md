~~**EUREKA! THE ART OF INVENTION**~~


**Introduction**


“Have a great idea. Have a lot of them.”—Thomas Edison


_Eureka! The Art of Invention_ is a 10-day ELA Quest. Quests are narrative-driven units that immerse

students in reading adventures. Through them, students read complex literary and informational texts

and consistently demonstrate their ability to find evidence and use it appropriately. Over the course of

the Quest, students write routinely in opinion, informational, and narrative modes, adjusting style for

the task and audience indicated. Beyond this, Quests are deliberately varied. Each aims to immerse

students in a new world, with new content and challenges. Quests are also more flexible than other

units. We have provided suggestions for how to customize the Quest throughout and encourage you to

make your own variations to suit your students’ needs.


As they go through _Eureka! The Art of Invention_, students read a range of informational texts about

inventors, inventions, and the process of creation. In addition to reading, students analyze objects and

situations in the world around them, identify problems, create evidence-based solutions, and ultimately

become inventors themselves. By routinely writing informational and opinion pieces, students practice

research, observation, communication, and persuasion. They also engage in a range of collaborative

discussions, sharing ideas and working in teams with defined roles and agreed-upon rules.


In _Eureka! The Art of Invention_, students are contestants on the bizarre and exciting reality TV game

show of the same name—a show in danger of cancellation because of a few . . . unfortunate incidents

last season. Students are divided into teams (labs) and participate in activities and challenges both

in groups and individually. Guided by inventor-judges Jacques Cousteau, Hedy Lamarr, Thomas

Edison, and George Washington Carver, as well as a host—you, the teacher—contestants learn about

the process of invention through examples and experiments. Throughout the Quest, the judges

will “interact” with students through videos and notes. Your role as host is the key to creating and

maintaining the game-show “world.” We have provided host scripts throughout the unit and hope you

will add in your own elements.


_Eureka! The Art of Invention_ also provides opportunities for students to build content knowledge and

draw connections to social studies and science subject areas. At times throughout the unit, you may

wish to build on class discussions to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the

strands of Science, Technology, and Society and Social Studies Skills from the Social Studies TEKS,

and Scientific and Engineering Practices from the Science TEKS. This content is not a replacement for

grade-level science and social studies instruction.


Introduction
**1**


~~**OVERVIEW**~~


Each lesson in the Quest is a 90-minute “episode” with a variety of activities. These tasks incorporate

reading, writing, and speaking and listening skills, which are explained in each Episode chapter.


~~**READING**~~


During the Quest, students read informational texts, pulling evidence and details to support

arguments. Reading activities are concentrated in the first half of this unit; however, students will

continue to refer back to the material in the _Eureka! Files_ reader throughout the Quest. Students

will read biographical articles about eight inventors, detailed histories of important inventions, and

scientific explanations of simple machines. Some of the content of the Quest will be familiar to

students: the microscope, George Washington Carver, Thomas Edison, and the Wright Brothers all

appear in earlier units.


**Note on Text Complexity and Support**


_Eureka! Student Inventor_ has a fairly high level of text complexity, both owing to the scientific nature

of the material and the character voices of the featured inventors. To help support students with the

reading, we have flagged the most challenging vocabulary in each lesson overview, as well as in the

text and glossary, that you may wish to introduce before you begin the readings or outside of the

Quest. Some text may be best taught as a teacher Read-Aloud or a class read-together, with frequent

pauses to summarize the meaning and check for comprehension.


In circumstances where Read-Alouds are impractical, such as when each lab is tasked with a different

reading, we either include headers that map to the activity questions and help break the reading down into

sections, or we keep the articles short. If there is great range of reading ability within your class, you may

wish to keep these lab-based reading activities in mind when creating labs, to promote peer support. For

more information about the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the

texts, see the Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources


Unit 2 Eureka! The Art of Invention
**2**


~~**SPEAKING AND LISTENING**~~


Comprehension and collaboration skills are developed throughout, as students establish rules

for group work and work together over an extended period in their labs on building, reading, and

presentations. Students make oral presentations about their inventions and demonstrate how and

what they have learned from their peers’ presentations. Audio and video components, as well as

teacher-read texts, give students opportunities to practice active listening.


~~**WRITING**~~ ~~**TEKS 4.2.C**~~


Throughout the Quest, students consistently practice informative and opinion writing. In addition

to working on developing arguments and using support, the writing challenges lend themselves to

adaptation and addition. You can focus on additional language standards by adding requirements

to the challenge. If you have extra time, you can also take advantage of the emphasis on building

collaboration skills and introduce a round of peer editing to one or more of the writing challenges.


In Grade 4, students will write legibly in cursive to complete assignments. Writing legibly includes

knowledge of how to connect letters, use appropriate spacing and letter height. In order to master

these skills, encourage students to complete activities in cursive throughout the unit.


~~**THE STRUCTURE OF EUREKA!**~~


This Quest is divided into two “rounds.” Round 1 consists of seven episodes, in which contestants earn

points by understanding six key skills: collaboration, research, pitching, knowledge, documentation,

and failure. After learning and practicing each skill, students face a “wedge challenge” (usually a short

individual writing assignment). Once all members of the lab successfully complete the challenge, the

lab earns the wedge, representing mastery of that skill, to add to their “Wheel of Invention.” In Lessons

1, 6, and 7, the focus is a building challenge in which students follow criteria established by the judges

to build a new invention and write about it.


Round 2 (three episodes) offers students more creative freedom as they design their own inventions.

The last two episodes of the Quest are especially flexible. Depending on your time, resources, and your

students’ interests and abilities, the final project may involve building working inventions, nonworking

invention models, and/or detailed diagrams. You may choose to have students work independently,

with partners, or as full labs. (We recommend that they continue to compete for their lab for scoring

purposes.) Final presentations may be made orally to the entire class, in a “science fair” style with

museum displays, on paper, or using any combination of these approaches. These options are set out

in detail in the Advanced Planning section of Episode 8.


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.


Introduction
**3**


**Round 1: The Wheel of Invention**


Episode 1: Collaboration


Contestants embark on the Quest and meet the eccentric judges. They review best practices for group

work, embark on collaborating with a whimsical building challenge, and write their first opinion piece

about collaboration.


Episode 2: Research


Contestants open the _Eureka! Files_ to read biographies of the judges. They use their research to

complete inventor cards, until the episode is interrupted by a cranky Thomas Edison.


Episode 3: Research/Introduction to Pitching


Contestants delve further into the _Eureka! Files_ to research the light bulb and write a persuasive

piece for Thomas Edison. Next, they use their research skills to gather evidence on other important

inventions. The host previews pitching, the next skill they’ll need to share that research.


Episode 4: Pitching


Contestants use their research to write and present pitches about the great inventions.


Episode 5: Knowledge


Contestants learn about simple machines and translate their understanding into physical movements

during a “Simple Machine Dance Party.” Next, they use their understanding of simple machines and

knowledge of great inventions to write a creative solution to a technical challenge.


Episode 6: Documentation


Contestants are given another building assignment and challenged to create a record of their work,

including diagrams and written directions.


Episode 7: Failure


Contestants explore the importance of failure in the inventing process. They revisit their invention

from Episode 6 in order to improve its functionality, and write a persuasive piece about the value of

learning from failure.


Unit 2 Eureka! The Art of Invention
**4**


**Round 2: Final Inventions**


Episode 8: Why We Invent


Students make up any unfinished wedge-challenge writing and complete the Wheel of Invention. After

listening to the judges explain what brought them to inventing, students explore problems that can be

addressed by inventing, conduct peer-to-peer interviews to research problems, then select a problem

their final inventions will address.


Episode 9: Invent!


Students complete their final inventions, give and receive feedback from their labs for improvements,

and prepare their final presentations.


Episode 10: The Finale


Students present their final inventions to the class, and the winner is declared.


**Recurring Activities**


While episode activities vary, there are some types that recur:


 - the TV show’s opening audio clip


 - a recap of the previous episode (“Last Time on _Eureka!_ ”), provided by a student


 - the distribution of wedges earned from the previous episode


 - an accounting for bonus points and the distribution of the leader marker, the Light Bulb of Glory, to the

top lab to display for the day


 - the return of workbooks ( _Inventor’s Notebooks_ ) and the collection of any homework


Introduction
**5**


    - Most episodes conclude with “Introspective Inventors,” a reality show-style confessional that asks

contestants to share what they’ve learned and questions brought up that day. (You may opt to do

“Introspective Inventors” more or less frequently than indicated in the script.)


    - videos of judges, teaching students the ways of inventors


    - Judges’ Notes also occur throughout the Quest. We provide these as audio recordings, or you can

choose to read the transcriptions aloud.


    - Inventor Cards: Students are asked to read inventor cards (similar in format to baseball cards), either

in class or as homework.


        - Optional Challenge: Students can complete additional inventor cards for bonus points using

articles about inventors that they themselves locate or that you provide for them.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available in the program’s online materials. This

component was created to accompany materials for Grades 4 and 5. It consists of selections from

a variety of genres, including poetry, folklore, fables, and other selections. These selections provide

additional opportunities for students to practice reading with fluency and expression (prosody). There

are sufficient selections so you may, if desired, use one selection per week. For more information on

implementation, please consult the supplement.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


**This Quest includes:**


     - **Teacher Guide**

The Teacher Guide provides detailed descriptions of the lessons in this Quest, learning objectives,

assessment opportunities, supports for universal access, copies of student reading and workbook

pages, and answer keys. All resources that need to be copied—Find Your Lab clues, Simple Machine

Lightning Round, blank inventor cards, the final pitch rubric—are found in the Teacher Guide at the

point of use and online in the program materials. More information on using the Teacher Guide is

found at the end of this section.


Unit 2 Eureka! The Art of Invention
**6**


- _**Eureka! Files**_ **(Student Reader)**

_Eureka! Files_ is the student Reader accompanying this Quest. Each copy of the _Eureka! Files_

includes all of the readings students will complete over the course of the Quest. Because different

labs are assigned to different topics, students will have more reading in their copy than they need to

complete. Students will need articles from the _Eureka! Files_ to complete the inventor cards assigned

as homework in Episodes 2, 4, 5, and 6. If you prefer students not take the _Eureka! Files_ home, you

can make copies of these articles.


- _**Inventor’s Notebook**_ **(Student Activity Book)**

The _Inventor’s Notebook_ includes all of the worksheets and prompts needed to complete the Quest’s

activities. You will need to collect it regularly to review student work, including the wedge-writing

challenges. At the end of the _Inventor’s Notebook_ is a blank inventor card for student use in Episode 10.


- **Wheels of Invention and Wedges**

There are six Wheels of Invention—one for each lab—and six wedges to every wheel. Display the

Wheels of Invention prominently during the Quest, and watch them fill with wedges! You may wish

to get a set of 36 Velcro dots so students can attach each wedge to the wedge spot on the wheel.


- **Light Bulb of Glory**

Like the yellow jersey in the Tour de France or the Stanley Cup in hockey, the Light Bulb of Glory is a

traveling trophy. The lab with the most points at the top of an episode is awarded the Light Bulb of

Glory to display.



4. Connect the top and
bottom pieces by
sliding each yellow
flap into one of the
four blue slots.



. Cut along the
dotted lines



2. Connect the paper
bulbs by sliding
them together.



3. Wrap and secure the
blue base with tape.



Introduction
**7**


     - **Stickers**

The stickers come in six varieties, and each design indicates a lab. Use them to mark _Inventor’s Notebooks_

for easier scoring of wedge challenges, to label the Wheels of Invention, and to create lab name cards.


     - **Inventor Cards**

There are two different perforated sheets of inventor cards for each student. The first sheet includes all

four judges and can be distributed to students on Episode 2 to tear apart. The second sheet includes

cards used at different points in the Quest, so you may prefer to tear them out and distribute them

on an as-needed basis so students don’t lose them. There are also two blank inventor cards: one at

the end of the _Inventor’s Notebook_, and one at the end of the introduction to this Teacher Guide. This

template can be copied so that students can make supplemental inventor cards for bonus points.


     - **Invention Cards**

These cards are used primarily for the Timeline of Invention in Episode 5. They can also be used

during the Invention Pitch Lightning Round in Episode 4 and can be posted as decorations around

the classroom.


**Digital Components**


Digital Components of the Quest are available in the program’s online materials.


     - **Audio Recordings and Audio Scripts**

Audio recordings are indicated by the speaker icon in the Teacher Guide. Audio recordings are fully

transcribed. They include an audio opening sequence (i.e., a voiceover that introduces the start of

each episode) and the Judges’ Notes. Jacques Cousteau and Hedy Lamarr have accents, so if you have

students who will have difficulty understanding the audio files, you may prefer to read them aloud.


     - **Video Recordings and Video Scripts**

These are indicated by a video-camera icon in the Teacher Guide. Scripts for all the Judges’ Notes

and videos are available as PDFs, if you wish to print copies for students.


Unit 2 Eureka! The Art of Invention
**8**


 - **Scoreboard Poster**

This is available as a PDF to print, display in your classroom, and use to keep track of lab points.

It is also available in this Teacher Guide at the end of the Introduction.


 - _**Eureka!**_ **Image of the Day**

This is a digital image available to project in your classroom to create atmosphere and excitement.

It can also be a fun backdrop for “Introspective Inventors.”

**Note:** This image is not integrated into the lesson.


 - **Digital versions of the print components.**


 - **Quiet and Applause signs**


 - **Winner’s Certificate**


~~**SUPPLIES TO GATHER**~~


These materials are not provided but are necessary or desirable to run the Quest. We have tried to

make them simple and accessible.


 - Materials follow for the building challenges in Episodes 1, 6, and 7, and in Round 2, should you choose

to include building. In testing, we used the following materials—you can adjust the list as appropriate

for your circumstances.


1. table tennis balls (required)


2. rubber bands (required)


3. tissues (required)


4. pencils (required)


5. cardboard


6. scissors


7. tape


8. wooden craft sticks


9. toilet-paper rolls


10. shoeboxes


11. markers


12. hole punchers


13. string


14. poster board


Introduction
**9**


    - Materials such as cardboard and markers are ideal to make lab name cards, as they are sturdy

enough to fold and display in the labs’ workspace. These name cards can stay in the labs’ workspace

throughout the Quest. (Episode 1)


    - music for the Simple Machine Dance Party Challenge (optional, Episode 5)


    - books and articles about additional inventors (optional, for bonus inventor cards)


~~**GRADING AND SCORING**~~


All scoring is done on a lab basis. Students earn points for their labs, even if they are doing individual work.


The bulk of scoring comes from completing each round. The Wheel of Invention earns labs 20 points,

and a trip to Round 2.


**Note:** If your students are having trouble completing the wheel and you want to move them along, you

may alternately choose to award three points along with each wedge as you go, instead of making it all

or nothing. (Completing the wheel then earns a two-point bonus, to add up to twenty points.)


The scoring of Round 2 is left to you. We have provided a possible 20-point rubric for individual

presentations, to be averaged across each lab.


Contestants can earn additional points throughout the Quest by winning games, successfully

completing small challenges, and creating bonus inventor cards. While we have indicated some

places to award bonus points, we encourage you to customize opportunities to your classroom

environment—use them to motivate good behavior, to reward excellent individual work or teamwork,

and/or for extra-credit research assignments.


Keep track of points on the scoreboard. At the end of the Quest, tally the points to determine the winner.


The script is set up so that you can review wedge-challenge writing in the _Inventor’s Notebooks_ after

class, provide feedback, and award wedges the next day. These challenges provide frequent formative

assessment opportunities. The Quest does not require that these challenges be formally graded, so

how you evaluate them is up to you.


Unit 2 Eureka! The Art of Invention
**10**


We build in 15 minutes in Episode 8 to make up incomplete assignments, but as you go you might want to

require students to revise writing as homework in order to earn their wedges. Another option, particularly if

your grading time is tight, is to require labs to submit only one wedge-challenge letter per skill.


The Light Bulb of Glory can go on the table of the lab currently in the lead each day.


~~**MAKE GOOD TELEVISION (AND HAVE FUN!)**~~


A great deal of the fun and excitement of this Quest lies in keeping the spirit of the reality game-show

running throughout.


As the teacher-host, you are the link between the unpredictable real-life action of the Quest and the

scripted animated videos. We’ve provided scripts within the Teacher Guide to help you create and stay

in character, but this is only a guide. You may wish to go off script and create your own host character,

maybe even give yourself a character name, or don a wild game-show jacket. Please have fun with it!

We do recommend that you read the script carefully to review your lines before going “on”—the Quest

is complicated, and there are some twists that it would be good to anticipate.


**Things to know about the show’s “backstory”:**


 - The Judges are unpredictable and crazy, but they really, really care about invention and the students’

success as well.


 - The network is mentioned often. When we mention the network, we are referring to the big, bad

executives downtown just waiting for an excuse to cancel _Eureka!._


 - Last season was a disaster. No one watched, no one learned to invent, and some of the challenges were

fiascos. We don’t know a lot about those challenges, but one involved a run-in with some jellyfish, and

another involved a lot of pudding.


Introduction
**11**


    - Both the Judges and the network regularly contact the host during episodes. These “calls” might be

through an imaginary phone, an invisible earpiece, or some other method that speaks to your character.


    - In addition to the elements in the script, we encourage you to find other ways to incorporate game
show-style flourishes throughout this Quest as seems appropriate.


    - To get students excited and engaged, treat them as a studio audience, as well as contestants. Ask

for a drumroll or a musical flourish before big announcements. Have them shout out the name of the

program at the opening and closing of each episode.


    - Use the applause sign to encourage students to support one another, and the quiet sign for “look at

me” and focus moments.


    - Pick a spot for the “camera” or the “producers” that you can reference throughout the episode.


    - If you have access to a video recorder, you can record “Introspective Inventors” and the Pitches

(Episodes 4 and 10), and show clips as a retrospective in Episode 10.


    - When you check in with students throughout the lessons, remind them of the “viewers at home” who

might have questions.


    - When reviewing students’ written work, make your comments “from the judges.”


    - Use music of your choice, or have students make music, to signal the beginning and ending of writing

time and other activities.


~~**USING THE TEACHER GUIDE**~~


Each episode/chapter in the Teacher Guide begins with an overview.


**This includes:**


    - Primary Focus objectives and Formative Assessments for each lesson


    - Lesson at a Glance, which breaks lessons down into sections, with associated materials and time estimates


    - Advance Preparation, which is divided into Read (reading, previewing Quest content and student

work), Customize (any decisions, choices, or rules teachers must establish for their class), Prop

Master (gathering and assembling materials), and preparation for Universal Access supports.


    - vocabulary from in-class and homework reading (does not appear every day)


Unit 2 Eureka! The Art of Invention
**12**


**Other Components:**


 - Check for Understanding


    - Each lesson provides several spots in which you can informally check that students understand the

ideas and skills in focus.


 - Pages from the _Eureka! Files_ and the _Inventor’s Notebook_ as well as inventor cards are reproduced as

screenshots in the Teacher Guide, so you will see what students see.


 - We include answer keys for activities where appropriate. In cases where students are responding to

different readings, all versions of the activity answer key are included.


 - Measures of Text Complexity


**Homework**


Homework is listed at the end of the episode.

~~**INTRODUCTION (5 MIN.)**~~


**Play audio: Opening**


_Thrown together by the happenstance of where they live and go to school,_

_a class of fourth graders has ten episodes to walk the path of invention_

_and emerge—maybe scarred, maybe stronger, but almost certainly better_

_—as inventors. This is the world of the reality game show_ Eureka! Student

Inventor _—where puppets pull the strings and “making it work” is only_

_the beginning._


**Inform class of its selection for the show.**

~~**FIND YOUR LAB MATCHING GAME (10 MIN.)**~~


**List the activity steps on the board**


1. Read your clue and circle any words that provide details about

your invention.


2. Find your group by discussing your clues with your classmates, and

listening for other clues that match yours.


3. Sit together and raise your hands so the host can confirm you are correct.


4. Create a name card for your lab and write an invention slogan.


  - Each lab will have four to five students. Sentences describe the airplane,

the microscope, paper, the clock, the radio, and the telephone.


**Explain the lab matching game**







Unit 2 Eureka! The Art of Invention
**22**


**Begin Lab Matching Game**


**Note:** You may want to prearrange the distribution of slips in order to ensure

that the labs include a good mix of students with complementary skills.


  - To make this activity easier and quicker, you can provide students with the

lab invention names before they try to match up. Do this by placing simple

prewritten name cards for the labs around the room, or by listing the

names of the labs on the board.


  - The radio and clock groups both include an extra clue, for students 25

and 26. If your class has more than twenty-six students, two students can

share a clue. If your class has fewer than twenty-five students, give a few

students two clues.


  - Once a lab is complete, confirm that the students have found the correct

group. Have them create their lab name card, and give each member of the

lab a sticker for their _Inventor’s Notebook_, plus one for the name card.


  - Award one bonus point to each lab with a catchy and informative slogan.

Record bonus points on the scoreboard.


Check for Understanding


Circulate to each group and confirm that students have found the correct
inventions for their clues. If students have not correctly identified their
inventions, point out key details in the clues and ask them to consider
which other inventions these could be describing.

**to keep track of those hours accurately.**


**People began measuring small units of time with sundials,**
**determining the passage of daylight hours by observing**
**the direction and size of shadows cast by the sun.**


**The next great innovation in timekeeping was a simple**
**bowl with holes carved in it: if you knew how long it took**

Support


Explain that the phrase
_build a better mousetrap_
means to take an existing

product and make it

even better.



**Note:** To make this exercise more competitive, you can freeze everyone

once the first card goes into the air and ask for evidence. If the student

has evidence, the lab gets a point and you move on to the next clue.


- To encourage greater participation, wait until all students have made their

choices, then spot-check for evidence by consulting with one member

from each lab. Every lab with evidence gets a point.


- Sample answers are provided, but there may be a good reason why you’d

want to ask Jacques Cousteau about adhesives! Any answer with a sound

supporting evidence should be accepted.


- Award a point to the top team, and collect inventor cards to review for the

research wedge.

Use the second approach to ensure that each group makes a choice and
supports its choice with textual evidence. Correct misunderstandings or
incorrect use of evidence when necessary.

~~**GOOD PITCH, BAD PITCH (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Once all groups have completed their worksheets and had them

approved, reconvene.


**Define** _**pitch**_ **.**









Support


Ask students questions
such as “Which student’s
facial expression indicates

that they are interested in
the topic?” or “Which pitch

is most focused on a

single invention?”



**Note:** Students may refer to a baseball pitch. Explain that a _pitch_ on our

show is a little like a baseball pitch in that it involves throwing out an idea.


**Play video: Good Pitch, Bad Pitch**


**Note:** The video demonstrates an excellent pitch for the chocolate chip

cookie, and a mediocre one for the light bulb.


Check for Understanding


By a show of hands, poll the class on which pitch was the “good” pitch.
If students do not clearly recognize the first pitch as the good example,
point out examples of good pitching during the following activity.



Unit 2 Eureka! The Art of Invention
**138**


**Make a chart on the board (see below).**


- Lead a discussion on the aspects of a good and a bad pitch, based on

evidence from the video.


- Identify pitching in terms of content (“what you say”) and presentation

(“how you say it”). Suggestions are included below.








|Col1|Good Pitch|Bad Pitch|
|---|---|---|
|What You Say<br>(Content)|<br> <br>many facts, well organized,<br>interesting, surprising,<br>reasonably drawn<br>conclusion based on facts|boring, scattered|
|How You Say It<br>(Presentation)|<br>good eye contact, easy to<br>understand, loud enough,<br>energy|monotone, mumbling, too<br>quiet|

~~**ADDING AUDIO TO THE PITCH (10 MIN.)**~~


**Introduce “Introspective Inventors”**






- Discuss potential audio for a light bulb pitch. Encourage students to think

of songs relating to light, electricity, persistence, etc., as well as sound

effects that would enhance a presentation. You might also ask about some

brief audio narration that would introduce the presentation and set the

proper mood.


- Give the labs a few minutes to decide on audio for their pitches.

~~**PITCHING REVIEW (10 MIN.)**~~


**Review Hedy Lamarr’s Rules for Pitching.**







Unit 2 Eureka! The Art of Invention
**150**


**List the activity steps on the board.**


- As students list rules, put them on the board.


- Remind students that there are rules for content (what you say) as well as

rules for presentation (how you say it).


**Introduce “Hedy Lamarr’s Pitch Planner” (template for pitches**
**that students will use).**






- Have students open their _Inventor’s Notebooks_ to “Hedy Lamarr’s Sample

Pitch Planner.”


- Complete it as a class, using the light bulb as a model. Students are

expected to write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.


- Remind students to refer back to their notes from the previous day and

also to the light bulb article in their _Eureka! Files_ .


- When doing the model pitch, don’t write a skit, but brainstorm ideas about

what that skit could be.


   - Clarify that when students create pitches in their labs, they will need to

write and perform a skit.


   - Skits should use dialogue (how characters speak to each other) and

can also include narration.


Check for Understanding


Check that students are taking notes on the Pitch Planner as you work
through it together. Remind students to refer back to their evidence on the
light bulb from the previous episode, and the article in the _Eureka! Files_ .

Allow students additional
time to take their answers
from Activity Page 4.1,
questions 1–5 and develop
them into a complete
paragraph.




- Students are expected to write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.


- Once students have written their paragraphs, have the lab members

read their paragraphs to one another while the listeners consult Hedy

Lamarr’s Rules for Pitching checklist to ensure that all elements have

been included.


- Each lab should then select one paragraph to present as part of its pitch.







~~**PLANNING: PITCH INTRODUCTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


**Break pitch planning into parts; have students complete the**
**introduction individually.**





Unit 2 Eureka! The Art of Invention
**156**


~~**PLANNING: SKIT WRITING AND AUDIO (15 MIN.)**~~


**Instruct students to complete Part 2 of pitch planning (skit writing).**






  - Labs write their skits.


  - Remind students to write dialogue for the characters in addition to narration.


     - To provide an example of dialogue, refer students back to the “Bad

Collaboration” script on page 5 of their _Eureka! Files_ .


**Note:** If students are having trouble getting started with their skits:


1. Have them start by listing their characters. Inventor plus TV host is a

good combination.


2. Ask them for a secret the inventor might have about the invention

(that students will know from the article). What questions can the TV

host ask in order to get the inventor to reveal this secret?


  - Labs practice giving their pitches and their skits.


~~**PITCHES (25 MIN.)**~~


**Introduce note from Hedy Lamarr.**



Challenge


Ask students to describe
the tone in which their
characters are likely to
speak, then to name words
in the dialogue that show
that tone. If students have
no such words in their
dialogue, have them revise
as needed.





Lesson 4 Speaking with Style—Pitching
**157**


**Play audio, read aloud, or invite student to read** _**Judges’ Note 4A.**_










                   - Labs pitch their inventions.

Check for Understanding


In order to evaluate each presentation and determine the winning group,
score pitches as students are taking notes. One possible scoring system
is 0–2 points for each of four categories: evidence, pitch writing, pitch
presentation, and collaboration.


- After each pitch, students should take a minute to complete “Hedy

Lamarr’s Notes for Knowledge” (Activity Page 4.3).

**Play audio: Opening**


_Thrown together by the happenstance of where they live and go to school,_

_a class of fourth graders has 10 episodes to walk the path of invention and_

_emerge—maybe scarred, maybe stronger, but almost certainly better—as_

_inventors. This is the world of the reality game show_ Eureka! Student Inventor _—_

_where puppets pull the strings and “making it work” is only the beginning._

**Play audio or read aloud Judges’ Note 5A.**










                   - Ask students to open their _Eureka! Files_ to the article on Louis Braille and

to take out the inventor card they completed yesterday or as homework.


Check for Understanding


Poll students on whether or not they think Louis Braille proves the case of
“invention breeds invention.” If students disagree, ask why and use this to
segue to the next discussion.


Unit 2 Eureka! The Art of Invention
**176**


**Discuss the concept “invention breeds invention” using Braille**
**as an example.**





**Note:** Braille can be found on menus, signs, and ATM keypads. Almost

anything that can be printed as a text can also be printed in braille.

Reading
Reading


Beginning
Ask, “What happened to
Braille when he was three?
Who is Charles Barbier?
What did Braille invent?
Could Braille have invented
his alphabet without
Barbier’s night writing
system?”


Intermediate
Guide students to find
evidence in the article to
answer the questions and
explain how “invention
breeds invention” in this
instance.


Advanced/
Advanced High
Remind students to use
information in the Braille
article for this discussion.


~~**ELPS 4.G**~~







**Write responses to “Invention breeds invention” on the board.**


Final list of ideas should include:


1. We use inventions to make other inventions.


2. We rely on earlier inventions within new ones.


3. Some inventions are improvements on old inventions.


4. Some inventions create new needs, which in turn generate

new inventions.


Lesson 5 Invention Breeds Invention—Knowledge
**177**


~~**TIMELINE OF INVENTION (10 MIN.)**~~


**Explain Timeline of Invention activity.**










                   - Distribute invention cards, and ask students to think about the invention

on the card. What had to be invented BEFORE the item on your card?


Check for Understanding


Before forming the timeline, ask students if they can think about a
previous invention that was necessary for their item to be invented. For
students who say “no,” check on their invention and affirm or correct.
After they create the timeline, ask a few students how they determined
where they belonged.


                   - Give students time to put themselves in order. Depending on the layout of

your classroom, decide where the first and last inventions should go.


                   - If you have fewer than twenty-five students in your class, post the extra

invention cards as landmarks in the timeline for students to use as

additional guidelines.


Unit 2 Eureka! The Art of Invention
**178**


**Note:** This is a very challenging (but fun) activity, and we do not expect

students will get the order 100 percent correct! That would require

incredible luck. They will need to make some guesses.


- Here are clues to help guide them:


   - Inventions marked u have their date of invention in the reading.

   - Inventions marked m are referenced in the reading, and there is

information there that will help.


- Compare the order with the correct answers.

explanations.


~~**ELPS 4.D; ELPS 4.F**~~




- Assign each lab one of the simple machine readings in the _Eureka! Files_ .


- Point out that the writers of these articles want to describe inventions and

explain how those inventions work. The writers use different text structures

to do this, often using more than one structure within a text. They use a

sequential structure if they want to describe how an invention works or how

it was developed over time. They use cause and effect to explain how or why

something works the way it does. They use a descriptive structure to provide

details about the invention. All of the writers provide diagrams that explain

how the inventions work in a visual way that supports the text. Tell students to

pay attention to how the writers present the information.


- Students read their articles and complete the “Simple Machine Dance

Party Challenge” (Activity Page 5.1). Students can work on the activity

together, but each student must complete their own notes. Students are

expected to write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.

**Make a list on the board.**


Possible answers include:


1. fork


2. spoon


3. bread


4. chopsticks


5. fingers (not an invention)


- Point out that there are things that spear, that scoop, that pinch—that

is, several different approaches, as well as slightly different designs for

the same approach (for example, a fork and a skewer both spear but are

designed differently).


**Explain the rules of “How Many Ways Can You Solve It?”**



Activity Page 6.1








                   - Play the game. Depending on time, you can play just one round, or all of

them. (You may also wish to play one now and save the others for breaks

later in the Quest or episode.)


                   - Students are expected to write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.


Unit 2 Eureka! The Art of Invention
**228**


**List the activity steps on the board.**


   - After every round, have a member from each lab read out that lab’s list;

record them on the board.


   - Labs earn one game point per accurate invention, plus an extra point if no

other lab has the invention on its list. Keep a running tally of points on

the board.


**Note:** We recommend that these points not equal bonus points on a 1:1

basis! Students often have many answers, and this activity is not that

important! Instead, use points just to determine the winner of the game

and award one bonus point to the winning lab.


   - The lab that wins the game earns a bonus point for the scoreboard.


   - Suggestions for rounds:


1. People need to travel far away: train, car, bus, airplane, etc.


2. People need to do math: calculator, abacus, computer, etc.


3. People need to record information: pens, pencils, tape recorders, video

recorders, etc.


Check for Understanding


Check that all students are participating with their groups and
contributing to the lists. Encourage non-participating students by asking
for additional suggestions or providing clarifying instruction.

- Assign each lab an object in the classroom (pencil sharpener, scissors,

desk) and have members draw a diagram of it on the board. The diagram

should include at least five labeled components. Ensure that each lab

member contributes to the diagram.


- Discuss the diagrams as a class.

_Thrown together by the happenstance of where they live and go to school,_

_a class of fourth graders has 10 episodes to walk the path of invention and_

_emerge—maybe scarred, maybe stronger, but almost certainly better—as_

_inventors. This is the world of the reality game show Eureka! Student Inventor—_

_where puppets pull the strings and “making it work” is only the beginning._


**“Last Time, on** _**Eureka!**_ **”**

   - Ask one or two students to recap what happened last time on _Eureka!_


**Housekeeping**

   - Return _Inventor’s Notebooks_ . For those students who did not successfully

complete the wedge writing, explain the process for making it up so that

they, too, can earn their wedge.


   - Ask students to have their Alexander Fleming card (yesterday’s

homework) available for discussion.

- Discuss what we can learn from failure. Sometimes things don’t work at

all—we need to try to figure out why. Sometimes they don’t work as well as

we would like.


- Discuss the video and Fleming homework inventor card briefly; reinforce

that the work of an inventor is to try to figure out why an invention isn’t

working or how it could be better, and continue from there.


Check for Understanding


Poll students on whether they agree/disagree that their inventions “failed”
in some way. Ask students to discuss why they think this, and how they
might improve their inventions.

Lesson 8 Why We Invent—Identifying Challenges





**279**


~~**EPISODE OVERVIEW**~~


Students will finish up any unfinished wedge-challenge writing and complete
the Wheel of Invention. The judges will explain what brought them to
inventing. Students will work independently and in pairs to identify and
evaluate problems that can be addressed by inventing and then select a
problem for their final invention.


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Note:** This lesson requires a bit more preparation and customization

than the previous episodes, but full preparation before you begin Episode

8 will help you for the remainder of the Quest.


**Read**

                   - Review students’ failure wedge writing (“Letter to the Network”) and

determine which labs have earned their wedge.


                  - Review lesson and video scripts. Preview Episodes 9 and 10.


**Customize**

                  - Review _Inventor’s Notebooks_ from all the previous lessons, and identify

any incomplete assignments or areas for improvement. Prepare individual

supports for the Make-Up writing activity, so that students can address

necessary improvements in this time.


                   - After reading Episodes 8, 9, and 10, determine the parameters and criteria

for the Round 2 invention.


                          - What criteria should students consider in choosing what problem

to solve with their Round 2 invention (see What Problem Should My

Invention Solve?)?


                          - Will students create final inventions alone, in groups of two, or as a lab?

                          - What will the final invention product be? A working invention, a non
working model, a written description, a diagram on paper?


                          - How will they present the final product in Episode 10?


                   - If you wish to provide specific questions for today’s brainstorming activity

(8.3), write them on board or have them ready to distribute. These might

include “What does your invention do?” and “How does it work?”


                   - Determine the format students will use for their final presentations.

Possible ideas:


Unit 2 Eureka! The Art of Invention
**280**


     - Follow a science-fair model—lab. Members set up tables with their

inventions and half the group stays with the inventions to present and

answer questions, while the other half visits other labs.


     - Invite parents or other teachers or staff to come to class and play the

role of “network executives,” checking up on the contestants or as

Special Guest Judges.


     - Have students participate in a “parade of invention.” Each student

looks into the “camera” and does a super-mini-pitch (name of

invention plus slogan).


     - Create an invention catalog with all the inventions included.


  - The script assumes that all labs will have completed all their wedges.

If this is not true, determine if those labs will be allowed to progress to

Round 2, and if so, what the conditions will be.


  - This script assumes students will create their own Round 2 inventions. If

they will be working in groups, adjust the language accordingly.


**Prop Master**

  - Test audio and video resources.


  - Prepare to project the “Image of the Day.”


**Universal Access**

  - Review students’ work in their _Inventor’s Notebooks_ . Identify where more

work is needed for the Make-Up Time, and provide sentence frames and

prompts to support students in revising and completing their work.


  - Prepare sentence frames for Activity Page 8.2:


     - A problem I would like to solve is ___.

     - I am choosing to solve this problem because I believe ___.

     - Which of the criteria does this problem meet or address?

     - How is this problem (big/small/interesting/something you care about, etc.)


  - Prepare sentence frames and guiding questions for Activity Page 8.4:


     - The problem my invention will address is ___.

     - The materials needed to build this invention are ___.

     - Questions might include: How will it ___? I am not certain how to ___. I

**Play video: Man on the Street.**


Judges conduct _“man on the street”_ interviews, asking people what they find

frustrating, what slows them down, what problems they would like to see

solved for themselves, and what problems need solving in their community.


**Introduce interview activity.**







**Brainstorm good questions to ask and write them on the board.**


Some possible questions include:


1. When is a time you were frustrated this week at home? At school?


2. What is something you wish you could do faster?


Unit 2 Eureka! The Art of Invention
**288**


3. What is something you find boring that you wish someone else would

just do for you?


4. What is something you find fun that you would like to do more of?


5. What is something you saw someone else having trouble with today?


6. What is a problem you would like to tell the president about? The

mayor of your town? The principal of your school?


   - Have students pair off within their labs and interview each other using “Problem

Research: Interviews” (Activity Page 8.1) in their _Inventor’s Notebooks_ .


      - First ask students to identify three of the questions that they find the

most interesting.


      - Allow five minutes for students to answer the questions for themselves

in writing.


      - Have students pair off to interview each other and write down their

partner’s answers to their questions.


      - Keep watch on the time. Halfway through the pair-share, remind

students to switch and allow the other person to interview. Students

are expected to write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.


Check for Understanding


Circulate to make sure pairs are following the interview format and
writing down their partner’s answers.


   - If time allows, bring the class together and ask a couple of students to

share an idea they heard during their interview.

   - As a class, decide the criteria for selecting the problems contestants will

address, and write them on the board.


**Note:** We suggest that you preselect a few criteria for selecting

problems, based on your students, classroom resources, and priorities.

Some possible criteria to select problems might include:


1. Do a lot of people deal with this problem? (Everyone brushes their

teeth and could use an improved toothbrush. Fewer people have

snakes for pets and need new snake toys.)


2. Is it a big or a small problem? (Spilling your cereal is annoying, but

easy to clean up. Not knowing that something is poisonous is very

dangerous!)


3. Is it an interesting problem? We’re still trying to make good TV!


4. Is it a problem you care passionately about?


5. Is it a problem you think you can invent a solution to (maybe only a

partial solution, of course) in three episodes?


6. If they will build: Is it something you can build a solution to with the

resources available?

**Transition to brainstorming.**






- Have students open their _Inventor’s Notebooks_ to Activity Page 8.4 and

complete the brainstorming activity. Students are expected to write legibly
in cursive to complete assignments.


- Remind students they have completed brainstorming throughout the

Quest. Today’s brainstorm is the most important because it is for their own
invention idea.


- Let students know they will have more time tomorrow to plan and

document their invention. The objective now is to begin the process by
getting a few ideas on the page.


   - In their brainstorming, encourage students to develop questions about

the invention that they do not have answers for. Their labs can help

with this later.


**Note:** You may want to ask students to answer a few set questions on

their brainstorming worksheets this time, so the “judges” have something

easier to read and respond to after class. Those questions could include:


1. What does your invention do?


2. How does it work?

**Note:** Depending on the presentation format you have selected for

Episode 10, you may wish to adapt these pitch-planning requirements.

For the “science fair” model, students might prepare a whole pitch for

visitors to their table. If students are working in larger groups and you

have time, you might add the requirement for a skit or advertisement.


Explain that a good presentation or pitch involves a multimodal

approach, or using different modes of communication. This means that

the pitch could contain written, oral, digital, and audio materials. Help

students brainstorm ways they could make their pitch multimodal—for

example, using posters, charts, graphs, models, music, sound effects,

video, photographs, and so on. ~~**TEKS 4.9.F**~~


**TEKS 4.9.F** Recognize characteristics of multimodal and digital texts.



Challenge


Have students illustrate
examples of good

Ask partners to watch the pitch and give feedback based on the judges’
criteria you put on the board.


- Remind the labs that one member should be responsible for ensuring the
group has access, as necessary, to digital or physical audio recordings that
will be part of their Episode 10 presentations.


**Note:** When multiple students are rehearsing, it is all right if the classroom
gets noisier and it may seem disorganized. By circulating, you can ensure

students are on-task and encourage them to focus on their own presentations.


Check for Understanding


Ensure that students use some of this time to rehearse their pitches, in
pairs or small groups. They should also practice presenting their models
or illustrations. Encourage them to stand up and imagine they are
speaking for the judges and the network executives. Encourage partners
to provide feedback using the judges’ criteria.

~~**CLOSING: “INTROSPECTIVE INVENTORS” (5 MIN.)**~~


**Introduce “Introspective Inventors.”**








- Invite a student to come to the front of the room and “face the camera, for

the audience at home.” Ask two or three questions, which might include:


1. How did the earlier challenges on _Eureka!_ help you today?


2. What was the best advice you received from someone else about

your invention?


3. What are you most excited about for tomorrow?


4. Which Judge do you think will like your invention the best, and why?
