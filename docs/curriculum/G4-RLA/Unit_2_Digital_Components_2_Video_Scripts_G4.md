### Welcome to Eureka!

Jacques Cousteau, Hedy Lamarr, George Washington Carver and Thomas Edison
sit behind a long table _à la_ judges of _American Idol_ . Jacques is wearing goggles on
his forehead and lots of scarves; Hedy is attired like the 1930s movie star she was,
George has a flower tucked behind one ear, and Thomas wears a period-appropriate
suit with cufflinks that light up. They all turn to look at the camera abruptly and in
unison. It is very dramatic.


**Jacques:** ( _with a thick French accent_ )

_Bonjour_, my intrepid leettle inventors. And welcome to our show!


**Thomas:** But what have they invented? _Maybe_ with enough hard work they’ll
invent something. But right now? They’re not inventors.


**George:** Come on, get excited! These students are themselves an undreamed
invention. What they will make, what they will become, remains to be
seen. Isn’t it thrilling, Hedy?


**Hedy:** ( _with utter boredom_ )

Yes, I could not be more thrilled.


**Jacques:** But—you will be when our show is a beeg heet! Then even you, lovely
Hedy, even you will be excited.


**Hedy:** Oh, Jacques, it is very sweet zat you think our show vill be a hit when
I have heard that ve are in danger of being cancelled at any minute!
Vhy? Because no one actually vatches ze show.


Unit 2 Episode 1 1


**George:** Well, with these intrepid students, as opposed to the more, shall
we say—


**Thomas:** Unimpressive.


**George:** I was going to say “less motivated” students of past seasons, with this
crop of seedlings, the show will certainly be a success.


**Jacques:** It is not in such danger, is it? I know for a fact that my mother’s
elderly friend Mathilde watches it when she is very very bored!


**Thomas:** Every year there is a 45% chance that a television show will survive to
see the next season. That’s not so bad!


**Hedy:** But zis means zere is a 55% chance ze show vill fail. If zere was a 55%
chance I vould die ven I left ze house tomorrow, I do not sink I vould
be leaving ze house.


**Jacques:** But you are already dead.


**Hedy:** How dare you address a lady in zis manner!


**Thomas:** He’s just stating a fact. We are—all four of us—dead.

( _Off camera, one can view the unseen audience’s shocked faces._ )

Yup: dead, dead, dead. That’s right, folks ( _and now Thomas_
_attempts a_ Price Is Right _-announcer-ish voice, and some cheesy_
_music plays after each name is said aloud_ )—Jacques Cousteau, who
invented what today is commonly referred to as _scuba_ —he is dead.
George Washington Carver, who came up with hundreds of ways
to use a peanut—


**George:** And a sweet potato—


Unit 2 Episode 1 2


**Thomas:** ( _annoyed_ )

And a sweet potato—

( _enthuasiastic again_ )

And helped countless people in doing so—even that kind of
extraordinary achievement cannot ward off death. Hedy Lamarr,
who was not only a movie star but an amazing inventor to boot—her
lovely self died many years ago.


**George:** And then we have Thomas Edison—


**Thomas:** Thomas Edison, inventor extraordinaire.


**Hedy:** Extraordinaire?


**Thomas:** Well, I did register over a thousand patents. No one else has come
close to that number—


**Hedy:** ( _interrupting him_ )

Okay, yes, you are very smart, and very accomplished, no von vill
contest zis, but zis show is not all about you.


**Thomas:** ( _matter-of-fact_ )

Sure it is.


**George:** ( _looking at the camera_ )

No, this show is about YOU—the students. You will spend the first
part of the show completing “the Wheel of Invention” so that—oh
it’s just so exciting!—so that by the final episodes you can invent
something _yourselves_ .


**Hedy:** Yes, you vill accumulate ze vedges that vill equip you to invent. Each
vedge corresponds to a skill that you vill need in order to come away
a vinner.


Unit 2 Episode 1 3


**George:** But it is much more about what you, the students, will invent than
about winning. I mean, you will think up something that was never
there before! That’s what this whole show is about, all in the name of—



**Hedy/**
**Jacques:**


**Hedy/**
**Thomas/**
**Jacques/**
**George**



Vinning! And the vinning group vill be crowned—


Eureka! Student Inventor!!!


( _Cut to black. End of Intro._ )



Unit 2 Episode 1 4


### Irate Edison

**Thomas:** Oh no. Oh no, no, no. Oh you’ve got to be kidding me. This is . . .
This is absurd. This is nonsense. This is fiddle-faddle and poppycock
of the highest order. I call fiddlesticks! I call tommyrot! I call rubbish,
rubbish, rubbish!!! Okay—okay, Thomas, calm down. Go take a bath.
That usually works. Is there a warm bath around here anywhere?
Does patenting over 1000 products get a man anything?? Are a tub
and hot water and lavender-scented soap bubbles too much to ask???
Aaaaaah!!!


Unit 2 Episode 2 5


### Good Pitch/Bad Pitch

( _Amber smiles at the class. She is a model student, but not a teacher’s pet._ )


**Amber:** ( _very naturally/enthusiastically_ )

Hello, my fellow inventors! I’m really pleased to be here today to tell
you about one of the truly terrific things that mankind—or in this
case, womankind—gave to the world: the chocolate-chip cookie.

( _She holds up her piece of paper—her pitch—and begins_
_to read, looking up at the class every now and then._ )

That’s right, folks. You heard me. A simple cookie that you take for
granted had to be _invented_ . Someone had to think it up. And that
person was Ruth Wakefield. A woman who owned a restaurant in
Massachusetts and one day in 1930 wondered what would happen if
you added pieces of chocolate to a butter cookie. And what she found
was that the pieces of chocolate didn’t melt! They stayed intact! And
the cookie tasted delicious! So I would argue that, even though this
invention doesn’t fix all the problems of the world, it is really one of the
most important inventions around—because it makes people happy.
Here are two examples. Let’s say you’re on a long car ride and your little
brother is being annoying. Maybe he poked you even though your
mom said “no poking” and then when you poked him back—which
is only fair, he started it—he began to cry. What a baby. But if you give
him a chocolate-chip cookie, he might stop crying—which will make
the trip much easier on everyone. Or, let’s say you’re watching your
favorite TV show while lounging on your couch on a lazy Sunday
afternoon. You think: “life could not get any better than this!” But then
you realize it _could_ get better. You _could_ be eating a chocolate-chip
cookie _while_ watching your show, making the experience even sweeter.

Basically, the chocolate-chip cookie is “happiness in just three bites”
( _or maybe more bites depending on the size of the cookie_ ).


Unit 2 Episode 3



6


**Teacher:**

_(from offstage)_



Thank you, Amber.

Great job, Team Cookie. Okay Team Light Bulb, you’re up.



( _Paul stands and slouches. He looks deeply uncomfortable. He looks at his piece of_
_paper. He looks out at the crowd. He doesn’t say anything._ )



**Teacher:**

_(from offstage)_



Whenever you’re ready, Paul.



**Paul:** ( _mumbling_ )

Okay, so, um, the light bulb. The light bulb is like, good, because, you
know, it lights up and stuff.



**Teacher:**

_(from offstage)_



Could you speak up a bit.



**Paul:** ( _a little louder_ )

People needed the light bulb and then it got made and it made
things easier . . .



**Teacher:**

_(from offstage)_



When did it get made? Who made it?



**Paul:** Oh, right. I think it was made by Thomas Edison in like, eighteen
seventy-something?

( _just occurring to him_ )

Oh hey! Once my dad told me a joke about light bulbs. “How many
policemen does it take to change a light bulb?” . . . And the answer is:
“None. It turned itself in.” Get it? It’s funny because sometimes people
turn themselves in to the police, but here the light bulb _turned itself_
in. Get it? That’s why it’s funny. My dad explained it to me. He’s a cop.


Unit 2 Episode 3 7


**Teacher:**

_(from offstage)_



… Okay, do you have anything else to add?



**Paul:** ( _looks at his paper. Then looks up again._ )

It was really important, the light bulb. It was just, like, important.



**Teacher:**

( _from_ _offstage_ )



( _unimpressed_ )

Is that it?



**Paul:** Yeah, it’s a cool invention.



**Teacher:**

_(from offstage)_



“A cool invention”? Is that really the best you can do?? I don’t think
Mr. Edison is going to be pleased about this. He’s not going to be
pleased at all.



Unit 2 Episode 3 8


### Simple Machines

**George:** Okay, goobers! You heard about how Ms. Lamarr’s remarkable
invention was based on the work of those who came before her. And
how modern scientists then used her invention to develop Wi-Fi,
GPS, cell phones and all sorts of things that none of us could have
imagined when we were inventing.


**Thomas:** Please don’t presume to know what _I_ could have imagined.


**George:** Of course not, Thomas. Just a figure of speech. Anyway, let’s talk
simple machines! I get the tingles just thinking about these six
inventions that became the basis for so many others.


**Thomas:** **(** _chuckles_ **.)**


**George:** Did I say something funny?


**Thomas:** No, no. I suppose when your greatest triumph comes in chunky
and smooth, a _simple_ machine might seem extraordinary. But my
inventions ushered in a new age! Electricity, movies, the phonograph.
I’m way beyond simple machines, and frankly, I think our student
inventors are, too.


**George:** That’s where you’re wrong, Thomas. All of our inventions are based
on inventions that came before them. I mean, consider the humble
screw. It’s one of our simple machines. Without the screw, wouldn’t
your light bulb be difficult to connect?


**Thomas:** **(** _grudgingly_ **)**

I suppose so.


Unit 2 Episode 5 9


**George:** And how about the wheel and axle? Another simple machine.
Doesn’t the handle of your phonograph depend on that mechanism?


**Thomas:** Well . . . yes, you could make that argument, I guess.


**George:** And take a look at the—


**Thomas:** I get your point, Carver!


**George:** Glad to hear it. Now, legumes, let’s go over the simple machines one
by one. Starting with the screw! Just a little cylinder with a spiral
thread running around it. But that thread makes it one of the most
powerful fastening tools around.


**Jacques:** Who invented it?


**George:** Great question, Jacques!


**Jacques:** _Merci, Georges._


**George:** **(** _getting a little annoyed_ **)**

It’s “George.” Just plain “George.”


**(** _back to lecture_ **)**

Anyway, the simple machines were all amazing breakthroughs, but
we don’t know who came up with them first. We just have to imagine
how exciting it would have been to witness the invention of the wheel.


**Hedy:** Vi vould that have been exciting? Did zey have anywhere zey actually
needed to go? “Oh goodie, zis morning ve can use our veels to get us
from one cave . . . to another cave.”


Unit 2 Episode 5 10


**George:** Actually, our number two simple machine, the wheel, wasn’t first used
for transportation. Wheels were attached to axles to make tasks easier.
You see, it’s easier to spin an axle attached to a wheel than an axle
on its own. Think about the handle of a doorknob as a wheel. A few
spins of the wheel and you’ve opened the door. It requires less force to
turn the knob than it would to turn the axle all by itself. Oh, another
great example is—


**Hedy:** Pick up ze pace, vill you? I can almost hear the United States changing
ze channel.


**George:** Fine, our simple machine number three is the wedge! Tools shaped
like a wedge are great for splitting, ploughing, all sorts of things. The
blade of an axe is a wedge.


**Jacques:** So is the front of a boat. The prow. It cuts through ze water like a
plough cuts through the soil.


**George:** The next two simple machines give humans superhuman strength.
Simple machine number four, the lever, is an astounding device that
consists of a beam resting on a fulcrum. You can lift very heavy loads
on one end of the beam by pushing down on the other. Like a see-saw.
Hey, with the right size lever, you could even lift . . . an _elephant_ !


**Hedy:** You could even lift Thomas Edison’s ego.


**Thomas:** Was that warranted?


**George:** Simple machine number five, the pulley, is a rope thrown over a wheel.


**Jacques:** I use pulleys to load cargo onto my boat. I string a rope through a
groove on a wheel, attach my cargo to one end of the rope and pull on
the other end. _Voilà_


**George:** If I were forced to choose a favorite simple machine, this last one
would be it.


Unit 2 Episode 5 11


**Hedy:** How vould zis happen?


**George:** What?


**Hedy:** Zat you vould be _forced_ to pick a favorite machine. Do masked
bandits roam the land threatening to throw inventors off ze roof if zey
do not choose a favorite machine?


**George:** It’s just an expression, Hedy. Now, everybody. Imagine a flat surface
tilted at an angle so that one side is higher than the other.


**Hedy:** It sounds like a ramp. Zis is your favorite machine?


**George:** It is, Hedy! Picture this. A prehistoric family lives in a cave, and the
entrance to the cave is two feet off the ground. One day the cavewoman
comes across a large rock she thinks would make a perfect coffee table
to go in front of her couch. Which is also a rock, by the way.


**(** _He laughs quietly, then continues._ **)**

Before the inclined plane, if the rock was too heavy to lift into the
cave, the family would be out of luck. But if they build an inclined
plane, our simple machine number six, they can roll the rock right
into the living room!


**Thomas:** Okay so that’s six, right?


**(** _to Stage Manager, who is offstage_ **)**

Can we move on?



**Stage**
**Manager:**


**Stage**
**Manager:**



Yeah. Judges—take lunch.


( _The puppets begin to disperse._ )


Oh, Carver. Some guy in a mask wants to talk to you. He’s up on
the roof.



Unit 2 Episode 5 12


**George:** On my way!


**(** _George exits. The others look after him for a moment, then at each other,_
_then quickly hurry after George._ **)**



**Thomas,**
**Hedy,**
**Jacques:**



George! Professor Carver! Stop! Georges!



Unit 2 Episode 5 13


### Failure

**George:** So the producers tell me we should talk about flavor. I’ll start with the
sweet potato! I guess I’d say it’s sweet, like a yam or a pumpkin, but
also—( _he hears something in his earpiece_ ) What? . . . OH, you want us
to talk about failure? I guess I must’ve failed to hear you.

( _He laughs, thinking this is very funny; but looks around and_
_no one else is amused_ )


**Jacques:** Georges ( _pronounced in the French way_ ), can we be _sérieux_ —that
means serious.


**George:** It’s George ( _pronouncing it as an American would_ )! How many times
do I have to—


**Jacques:** That is what I said: Georges ( _still pronouncing it the same way_ ). And
anyway, it does not matter—failure is so closely linked to success;
there is really no sense in trying to distinguish one from the other.


**Hedy:** Vat?? No, there is failure. It exists—all on its own, in ze crude light
of day. I myself—beautiful movie star and brilliant scientific mind—
have experienced failure. I myself have experienced crushing defeat.


**Jacques:** It is not possible.


**Hedy:** It is.


**Jacques:** It is not.


Unit 2 Episode 7 14


**Hedy:** ( _sharply_ )

I vill not play zis game vit you! It is possible. It happened many many
times. For instance, I once invented a cube zat you could put in water
to turn it into vat you Americans call “soda pop.” I worked hard on zis
thing and I thought it would change the world, or at least the beverage
industry, and zen—poof! Nothing. It didn’t make enough fizz.


**Thomas:** But if we don’t risk failure, we don’t stand to gain a thing. In fact,
many of life’s failures are experiments that were so close to success!
So … you just have to keep going. And if you have enough ideas,
some of them, a few of them, 1,093 of them, will be really good ones.


**Jacques:** Maybe it will be more helpful to ze little tadpoles to talk a bit more
specifically about some actual failures on the road to actual success.


**George:** Right, like that light bulb you’re always yammering on about.


**Thomas:** I thought you would never ask. Yes! Finally! Let me paint the
scene—1878: horse-drawn carriages, candles in every window.
There was electricity, but no one had figured out how to light small
areas—rooms—as opposed to whole city streets. I thought I could
figure it out in six weeks. And so I started experimenting with
the filament—the metal wire inside the bulb. I tried making it out
of different materials. But no matter what I did, the bulb would
just—zap!—burn out. It was a year before I found a combination
that worked. Then it took another whole year to make a lamp that
wouldn’t burn out after a week. But in that whole time I never felt
I was failing. I felt I was ruling out possibilities one by one and
getting closer and closer to the answer.


**George:** And that kind of patience and persistence in the face of frustration is
the mark of a good inventor.


**Thomas:** Ahem.


Unit 2 Episode 7 15


**George:** ( _reluctant_ )

A great inventor.


**Thomas:** Ahem ahem.


**George:** ( _really reluctant_ )

Inventor extraordinaire.


**Thomas:** ( _saying George as Jacques does_ )

Indeed it is. Thank you, Georges.


**George:** It’s George!!


( _George throws up his hands and exits. End of video._ )


Unit 2 Episode 7 16


### Why We Invent

**Thomas:** Why we invent?? What an absurd question. We invent because we see
a problem in the world that needs to be solved. Like people not being
able to light their homes! A pretty big problem if you ask me. Why
_else_ would anyone invent?


**Jacques:** I will say only one thing—


**Hedy:** ( _interrupting him_ )

It vill be ze day ze pigs fly when you say only one sing.


**Jacques:** Oh, Hedy, you know me so well! You must be in love.


**Hedy:** I am absolutely one hundred percent not in love with you.


**Jacques:** ( _he doesn’t believe her_ )

If you say so.

( _turning back to Thomas_ )

So I did not invent with the objective of solving a problem in ze
world. I invented for more personal reasons. I created ze scuba
because I wanted to spend more and more time with the great love of
my life—


**Hedy:** Jacques, please cut zis out now. It’s enough!


**Jacques:** The ocean.


Unit 2 Episode 8 17


**Hedy:** ( _a little hurt_ )

Oh.


**Jacques:** At a certain point I wanted to be able to go deeper into the ocean
and to stay there longer. And so, with a friend, I made something
that would allow me to do so. And happily my invention helped
ze world too—what can I say—I am just that good. For instance,
if a ship filled with treasure were to sink, and you wanted to try to
retrieve that treasure, you’d need to be able to stay underwater for
quite a long time.


**George:** But how many people does that help? I mean, sure, maybe a _few_
people get rich from finding lost treasure; maybe a _few_ people get to
enjoy the wonders of the undersea world but is that so practical? Does
it save lives??


**Jacques:** It can!


**George:** Does it help the masses?


**Thomas:** Like the light bulb.


**George:** Like my many ideas about ways to use the peanut, the pecan, the
sweet potato, and the soybean. I saw that southern farmers needed to
make a better living—a problem—and so I came up with a solution:
more and different uses for their crops. According to the Internet, I
figured out ways to make adhesives, axle grease, bleach, buttermilk,
chili sauce, ink, instant coffee, mayonnaise, paper, plastic, pavement,
shaving cream, shoe polish, talcum powder and wood stain. Wow, the
Internet really is thorough.


**Hedy:** I must say, George—you made a lot of use of those crops.


**Jacques:** But you can’t compare scuba gear and mayonnaise.


Unit 2 Episode 8 18


**Thomas:** I can compare _anything_ to the light bulb and find the light bulb
superior every time.


**Jacques:** Anyway, it’s not a competition, Hedy.


**Hedy:** Of course it is. It’s—


**All Judges:** Eureka! Student Inventor!!


Unit 2 Episode 8 19


### Man on the Street

**Jacques:** ( _to the camera, in a conspiratorial whisper_ )

_Bonjour_, it is me, Jacques Cousteau, your _favorite_ judge. What can I
say? I am very likeable. Recently I took that likeability to the streets.
And guess what? Today is your lucky day because I will share with
you the fruits of my labor. Here is the video that we made when I,
Jacques Cousteau, asked the real people on the street about what they
felt needs to be fixed in the world. And by listening to them we all will
get ideas for new inventions! Let’s roll that tape, yes?


( _Jacques Cousteau stops a woman on the street_
_outside_ _the offices._ )


_Bonjour, madame!_ Would you mind very much if I asked you a few
very simple questions about the whole world and your place in it and
where you see it all going in the future?


**Woman 1:** Actually it would be helpful if you narrowed your questions a little.


**Jacques:** ( _a little frustrated_ )

Fine. I suppose I am most curious about problems you experience
in your life, in the world; you know, problems in your home, in your
place of work, in your neighborhood. In your community.


**Woman 1:** Okay, that’s still a lot of questions.


**Jacques:** Really??


**Woman 1:** Yeah …


Unit 2 Episode 8 20


**Jacques:** ( _really frustrated_ )

Fine! Are there any problems in your life, your daily life, that you
would love if someone solved?


**Woman 1:** Can I say “people bothering me on the street?”


**Jacques:** No.


**Woman 1:** Okay … Then I’d say I hate when I get in bed and realize I’ve forgotten
to brush my teeth, but I’m too tired to get out of bed and do it. I think
you should be able to brush your teeth in bed without lifting a finger.


**Jacques:** You would say that, wouldn’t you.


**Woman 1:** Was that a bad answer?


**Jacques:** Well, it has nothing to do with the ocean.


**Woman 1:** Was it supposed to?


( _Producer whispers to Jacques_ )


**Jacques:** Okay, we’re moving on.

( _another man passes by_ )

Excuse me, sir, I’m wondering what problem at your place of work
might be solved with a new invention.


**Man:** Hmm … Maybe … Maybe it would be great to have a watch that
beeped a few minutes before a meeting to remind you about the
meeting and then you’d never be late to meetings … ?


**Jacques:** I’m fairly certain that exists already, but let’s say the problem you’ve
identified is being late to meetings at work.


Unit 2 Episode 8 21


**Man:** Yeah!

( _The man returns to his phone call._ )


**Jacques:** Can’t anyone come up with a decent idea!?

( _A woman sits on a bench._ )

Excuse me! _Excusez-moi, madame._


**Woman 2:** Yes?


**Jacques:** You look like someone who thinks about her community and
problems it might be facing.


**Woman 2:** I _am_ someone who thinks about her community and problems it
might be facing.


**Jacques:** What are some of those problems? Name one.


**Woman 2:** Well, for one, it’s a problem that in the mornings, the early mornings,
the electric company is sometimes drilling in the street, and it’s
incredibly loud and it wakes everyone up.


**Jacques:** How terrible.


**Woman 2:** It’s another problem that when I buy a banana and walk around with
it all day in my bag it’s mushy by the time I want to eat it.

( _She gets out a banana and demonstrate_ s.)

It was just fine this morning.


**Jacques:** ( _unimpressed_ )

And I’m being told that’s all we have time for.

Yes, I think we are out of time.

Thanks so much, and students—I cannot wait to see what kinds of
problems you end up wanting to solve!


Unit 2 Episode 8 22


### Eureka Survives!

**Hedy:** Well, how do you like zat? How do you like zat?!


**George:** Bravo, seedlings! Bravo!


**Jacques:** Those pitches were unparalleled— _sans précédent_ . Far and away
superior to last season’s. Mi-Shell and I are very impressed!


**Hedy:** You certainly exceeded my expectations, even zough zey vere,
admittedly, very low.


( _They all look at Thomas, waiting for him to offer his congratulations._ )


**Thomas:** Yes. That was fine.


**George:** That’s it??


**Jacques:** Well—I’m still not sure they truly appreciate the wonders of the
light bulb—


( _The judges get an announcement from the producers in their earpieces. They_
_spontaneously jump up and down and break out in cheers, drowning Thomas out._ )


**Hedy:** We are saved! Ze show is saved!


**Jacques:** Oh my! Oh my! Oh my! Zis is more exciting than jumping into
the ocean without any clothes on! Oh, how bracing that is. But
also wonderful!


Unit 2 Episode 10 23


**George:** We’ve been renewed! Woo-hoo!!


**Hedy:** Incredible!


( _Jacques raises his hand for a high five._ )


**Jacques:** Come on, Hedy. High five!


( _She pauses and then high-fives him. Thomas stands very still and off to the side a bit._ )


**George:** Thomas!! Live a little. Undo those cufflinks and let your hair down.


**Thomas:** Well, I don’t have much hair to—


**George:** It’s an expression!!


**Hedy:** The leetle inventors saved the show!! This is good news for them,
but also for me. Now I can afford to eat all the bockwurst and
_wienerschnitzel_ I could possibly desire!


**Jacques:** And now we can all be together—forever!


**Hedy:** Or at least for one more season.


( _all the judges dance_ )


**George:** Well, okay—that wore me out! I’m gonna sit down for a spell. And
you might want to sit down too, because the producers tell me you
student inventors did such a good job that you have earned the right
to make some more inventor cards—about yourselves!


Unit 2 Episode 10 24


**Jacques:** Yes, there is immortality in inventing! You stay alive through your
inventions. We four here are a case in point. So make your inventor
cards! And be proud of yourselves! I know I am.


**Hedy:** I am too.


**George:** And me.


( _They look at Thomas._ )


**Thomas:** I am too. Very proud.


**All Judges:** And you should be too!
