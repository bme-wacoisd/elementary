###### Introduction


~~**AMERICAN REVOLUTION: BUILDING A NATION**~~


This introduction includes the necessary background information to teach the American Revolution
unit. This unit contains 16 daily lessons, plus four Pausing Point days that may be used for
differentiated instruction. You may choose to use all four days at the end of the unit, or you may use
one day immediately after Lesson 7 and three days at the end of the unit. If you use one Pausing Point
day after Lesson 7, you may administer Activity Page PP.1 to assess students’ understanding of the
content at this midpoint, or you may use the day to focus on writing, spelling, grammar, or morphology
skills covered in Lessons 1–7. Each entire lesson will require a total of 90 minutes. Lesson 16 is devoted
to a unit assessment. This unit also contains the Middle of Year Assessment, which should take no
longer than two days. It is recommended that you spend no more than 22 days total on this unit.


~~**WHY THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION UNIT IS IMPORTANT**~~


**Note:** To prepare for this unit, read this entire introduction, preview the unit and content

assessments, and preview the Teacher Resources section of this Teacher Guide. You may wish to

collect assessment Activity Pages 16.1, PP.1, and PP.2 from students before beginning the unit.


The Big Idea of this unit is that disagreements about principles of government led colonists in North
America to seek independence from Great Britain. The causes, major figures, and consequences
of the American Revolution provide a framework for understanding what caused the 13 colonies to
break away and become an independent nation, and what significant ideas and values were at the
heart of the American Revolution.


Introduction

**Prior Knowledge**


Students who have received instruction in the program in Grades K–3 will already have pertinent
background knowledge for this unit. For students who have not received prior instruction in the
program, introductory knowledge with particular focus on the bolded objectives that follow will be
presented in the Core Connections lesson in Lesson 1.


Colonial and Native Americans (Kindergarten)


Kings and Queens (Kindergarten)


America: Our Great Country (Kindergarten)


American Independence (Grade 1)


Native American Regions and Cultures (Grade 3)


Early Explorations of North America (Grade 3)


Colonial America (Grade 3)


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


~~**READER**~~


The Reader for this unit, _The Road to Independence_, includes complex text and prepares students
in Grade 4 for the increased vocabulary and syntax demands aligned texts will present in later
grades. _The Road to Independence_ focuses on important events and people that led to the colonists’
decision to declare independence from the British government. Students will examine the sequence
of events leading to the American Revolution and what happened during the war itself. Students will
also read two literary selections about the time period. It is important to remind students that these
literary selections are fictional and cannot happen. For more information about the quantitative
and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text
Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


The Reader also includes two additional selections that may be used for enrichment. Although the
Teacher Guide does not include lessons for these enrichment selections, the Activity Book includes
activity pages that students may complete independently. Please use these selections at your
discretion, considering students’ needs and the time available in your school day.



~~**WRITING**~~



~~**TEKS 4.2.C**~~



In the writing lessons, students will review the stages of the writing process and engage in
an extended writing project. In this unit, students will enact and record key information from
vignettes corresponding to the causes of the American Revolution. These activities will lead to the
development of a five-paragraph cause-and-effect essay.


In Grade 4, students will write legibly in cursive to complete assignments. Writing legibly includes
knowledge of how to connect letters, use appropriate spacing and letter height. In order to master
these skills, encourage students to complete activities in cursive throughout the unit.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available in the program’s online materials. This
component was created to accompany materials for Grades 4 and 5. It consists of selections from
a variety of genres, including poetry, folklore, fables, and other selections. These selections provide
additional opportunities for students to practice reading with fluency and expression (prosody).
There are sufficient selections so you may, if desired, use one selection per week. For more
information on implementation, please consult the supplement.

 - Tell students they will begin a unit called American Revolution. Explain that a
revolution is an attempt by many people, often with violent fighting, to end the
rule of one government and start a new one.


 - Tell students the Reader title for this unit is _The Road to Independence_ . Tell
students independence means freedom from outside control or support.
A person who is independent is not controlled or financially supported by
someone else. A country that is independent is not controlled or ruled by
another country.


 - Explain that before reading the first chapter of the Reader, you will discuss what
life in America was like before the time and events described in the Reader to
help students better understand what they will read about. Tell them they may
already be familiar with some of the events and this time
in history.


 - Remind students who participated in the program in previous grades that they
have read about Native Americans, European explorers, and colonial America.


 - Explain that the events leading to the American Revolution began with another
war that took place in North America called the French and Indian War. Remind
students who participated in the program in Grade 3 that they learned about
the French and Indian War during the _Colonial America_ unit.


**TEKS 4.7.D** Retell, paraphrase, or summarize texts in ways that maintain meaning and logical order; **TEKS 4.13.H** Use an
appropriate mode of delivery, whether written, oral, or multimodal, to present results.



Support


Early explorers called
Native Americans “Indians”
because the explorers
thought they had landed
in Asia, in the country
of India.


Support


In Europe, the French
and Indian War is
recognized as the Seven
Years’ War. French
Canadians know it as La
guerre de la Conquête or
War of Conquest.



Lesson 1 The French and Indian War Brings Change
**9**


Activity Page 1.1



~~**IDENTIFY KEY LOCATIONS (5 MIN.)**~~


- Have students turn to page 91 in the Reader. Alternatively, you may direct
students’ attention to the Colonial North America Map you prepared in advance.
Explain that this is a map of colonial America showing the 13 colonies. Point out
that the area that is now the state of Maine was once part of Massachusetts.


- Next, show students on a globe or world map where Europe and, more
specifically, France and Great Britain, are located. You may also want to point
out where the United States and Canada are located in North America.


~~**ENACT VIGNETTES (20 MIN.)**~~


- Have students turn to Activity Page 1.1 (Core Connections Vignette).


- Tell students they will review the events that led up to the American Revolution
by performing a vignette, or series of short scenes from history.


- Tell students four scenes are included within this vignette. Have a student read
the names of each scene:


   - Scene I: European Explorers and the “New World”


   - Scene II: Native American Alliances


   - Scene III: Competing for the Same Land


   - Scene IV: A Long, Long War


**Note:** You may wish to point out that the royals, explorers, religious pilgrims,

and Native Americans in the vignette are representative of their roles at that

time in history.


- Enact Scene I by having students with assigned roles read and act out
their roles.


**Scene I: European Explorers and the “New World”**


Characters: Narrators (4), Timeline Tracker, Audience Member, English
Royal, English Explorer, French Royal, French Explorer, Pilgrim Leader


Narrator 1: The Age of Exploration occurred from around the 1400s to the
1600s. Ships left busy ports of Spain, Portugal, France, Holland, and England
to sail around the world. The explorers aboard these ships sought more than
adventure. European kings and queens paid them to find gold, spices,
and land. And many explorers came as a way to worship God.



Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**10**


**Timeline Tracker:**


- Point out “Age of Exploration” on the Core Connections Timeline on display.


Audience Member: That’s when Christopher Columbus discovered
America, right?


Narrator 2: That’s right. In 1492, Columbus claimed land in the Americas
for the king and queen of Spain. After that, many other Europeans followed,
curious about what this “New World” had to offer.


**Timeline Tracker:**


- Point out “Christopher Columbus” on the Core Connections Timeline.


Narrator 3: In the mid-1500s, both the English and the French began to
form colonies in the “New World.” In 1607, the English established their first
permanent colony in Jamestown, Virginia. And in 1620, Plymouth Colony was
established by a group of religious pilgrims in Massachusetts.


Narrator 1: After that, as they say, the rest is history!


**Timeline Tracker:**


- Point out “Jamestown” on the Core Connections Timeline.


Narrator 4: Imagine now that you live during the early 1600s. Listen as first
the king (or queen) of England and then the king (or queen) of France each
talk to an explorer about traveling to the New World. Both countries are
anxious to claim more land in North America.


Narrator 1: First, the English.


English Royal: Spain keeps claiming more and more territory across the
Atlantic Ocean. We need to get over there and take a share—a _large_ share—
for our homeland.


English Explorer: Well, sir (ma’am), it seems Spain has already claimed most
of the territory in Central and South America. No worries, though, we will get
as much of the remaining land as we can!


(English Royal and English Explorer sit down.)


Narrator 1: Now, the French.


French Royal: We, too, shall sail to this New World and get as much land and
riches as we can for France.


French Explorer: Yes, your majesty!



Support


Prior to Scene III, tell
students that _non_ means
“no” in French. It is
pronounced /noen/.
Also tell students _unison_
means “all together.” Have
students say _non_ in unison
to practice for the scene.



Lesson 1 The French and Indian War Brings Change
**11**


(French Royal and French Explorer sit down)


Narrator 2: The Age of Exploration also included those seeking a place
to worship God. Listen to an English Pilgrim leader talk to fellow religious
believers who are looking to the New World as a place of freedom.


Pilgrim Leader: The King of England is standing against us. We are not able
to worship as we believe. He will put us in jail unless we change our beliefs.
We will sail to create a New England. We will be free to worship the Lord and
keep his commandments.


**Scene II: Native American Alliances**


Characters: Narrators (4), Timeline Tracker, Native Americans (2), English
Explorer, French Explorer


Narrator 1: At about the same time that English colonists settled Jamestown
and Pilgrims settled Plymouth, French colonists arrived in New France and
settled Québec.


**Timeline Tracker:**


                - Point out Québec on the Core Connections Timeline.


Narrator 2: Many of these French and English explorers encountered Native
American tribes already living on the land, just as Christopher Columbus had
more than 100 years earlier.


Narrator 3: Listen as two Native Americans encounter European explorers
for the first time.


Native American 1: Did they say “New World”?


Native American 2: What “New World”?


Native American 1: Who are these people?


Native American 2: And what do they want?


Narrator 3: There were many different Native American tribes, some trading
with one another, some fighting one another, and some forming alliances
with other tribes, both to trade and to wage war. Now, they had to decide
what to do with these new “tribes,” the Europeans.


English Explorer (to Native American 1): We will trade knives, glass, copper,
and brass in exchange for meat, fish, animal skins, and furs.


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**12**


French Explorer (to Native American 2): We will teach you how to hunt with
metal weapons if you will teach us to hunt in the wilderness.


Narrator 4: For many years, Europeans traded goods with Native Americans.
Over time, some tribes formed alliances with the English and others formed
alliances with the French.


**Note:** The term “British” applies to contexts from the 1700s on, after the

formation of The Kingdom of Great Britain. The Kingdom of Great Britain

includes England, Scotland, and Wales. In this unit, we mainly use the terms

“Great Britain” and “Britain.”


Check for Understanding


**Four Corners.** Assign each corner of the space/classroom a range
of understanding from little understanding (Corner 1) to secure
understanding of vignette content (Corner 4). Ask students to disperse
to the corner that reflects how they feel. Send students from Corners
3 and 4 to partner and help the students with questions. Circulate and
provide clarification as needed.


**Scene III: Competing for the Same Land**


Characters: Narrators (2), Map Guide, British General, French General,
French (all students)


Narrator 1: Explorers from many European countries raced to claim areas
of North America for themselves. The English crown and English religious
pilgrims established colonies along the east coast of North America—between
Spanish settlements to the south, and French settlements to the north.


Map Guide: Point out the English colonies as well as the areas north and
south of the colonies on the Colonial North America Map.


Narrator 2: By 1733, the British had established 13 colonies in America, the
last one being Georgia in 1733. But British colonists prospered, with large
families growing up in America and more settlers coming from Britain. As their
numbers continued to grow, they pushed westward, across the Appalachian
Mountains to an area already occupied by the French—the Ohio River Valley.


British General: We need more land so more of our families can build homes.
We have been blessed. This rich river valley is a true land of opportunity.


Lesson 1 The French and Indian War Brings Change
**13**


French General: The French established forts and trading posts here long
before the British ever crossed the mountains. Everyone knows this land is
called New France.


Narrator 1: This was not a good combination! The British and the French
had been enemies for years on the other side of the ocean. Now, they were
competing for the same land in North America. Listen as French and British
generals justify their claim to the same land.


British General: (clearing throat) Ahem. It is a well-known fact that the land
belongs to Great Britain. The members of the British Parliament even wrote
to tell the French to leave at once.


Narrator 2: Hmm. This was a bad sign! (to audience) Do you think the French
will cooperate with this request?


French (ALL): (pausing as if to consider this request before replying in
unison) _Non!_


Narrator 1: The British prepared to defend the land. And so did the French.
It seemed conflict was unavoidable.


**Scene IV: A Long, Long War**


Characters: Narrators (4), Audience Members (2), Timeline Tracker


Narrator 1: And so it was that fighting began between the British and the
French, both wanting to control land west of the Appalachian Mountains, the
Ohio River Valley.


Narrator 2: Both sides knew they could not defeat the other without the
help of Native Americans. Similar to the British on the coast, the French
established trading partners with Native American allies too.


Narrator 3: The British made trading partners with Native American allies, too.


Narrator 4: Different Native American tribes had been allies with each other,
and waged war with other tribes for centuries. Now, they would be joining in
a fight between Britain and France.


Narrator 1: So both Britain and France received help from different Native
American tribes when the fighting began.


Narrator 2: Eventually, Britain officially declared war on France in 1756. But
the British and French colonists had already been fighting for two years in the
wilderness of North America. The French and Indian War was well underway.


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**14**


Audience Member 1: Wait! The French and Indian War? Why isn’t it called the
French and British War?


Narrator 3: Excellent question. The war is known as the French and
Indian War because the British fought against the French and their Native
American, or Indian, allies.


Narrator 1: That’s right. The French and Indian War was not a war between
the French and the Indians. It was between the French and the British—part
of their ongoing struggle for control of land in other parts of the world.


Audience Member 2: So, fighting was going on in other parts of the world at
the same time?


Narrator 2: Yes, the French and Indian War was just part of more fighting involving
many countries, particularly the French and the British, around the world.


Narrator 3: Fighting continued in the wilderness of North America for a very
long time—almost nine years in all.


Narrator 1: Yes, and that was only the beginning. Even though Great Britain
became the dominant power in North America after the war, life in the British
colonies was never the same.


Narrator 2: But that’s a lesson for another day.


**Timeline Tracker:**


- Point out “French and Indian War Begins” on the Core Connections Timeline.


~~**LESSON WRAP-UP (15 MIN.)**~~


- Have students recall what event in history they will be learning about in this unit.


   - The American Revolution


- Have students work in partners to summarize what they learned in this lesson
in a quick diagram or annotated map.

   - Answers may vary, but should include information about the Age of
Exploration and colonies and settlements in the New World. Native
Americans lived in the New World prior to the arrival of explorers. Some

Support


_Turned a blind eye_ means
they knew about them
but pretended they did
not know about them.
_Prospering_ means “making
a lot of money.”



**Taxes**

The British government had borrowed a lot of money to fight this
war. A lot of that money had been spent on protecting the colonists from
the French and their Native American allies. All of the money had to be
paid back, and the British government felt that the colonists should pay
their share. In addition, more money was continually needed to protect
the colonies as well as the newly acquired land.


To raise the needed funds, the British
government **imposed** new **taxes**, including several
that would have to be paid by the colonists.
In 1765, King George III and his government
proposed the Stamp Act.


The Stamp Act was a tax on printed materials.
Colonists were required to buy stamps when they


**or embossed on paper.**

even playing cards. These were not gummed stamps,
but rather impressions imprinted or embossed on paper. Many people were
upset about the Stamp Act. They thought it was unfair that the king and
his government in London were making decisions about taxes the colonists
had to pay, while the colonists had no say in the matter.


The British government had generally allowed the colonies to
raise taxes themselves. For example, if the government of Virginia
needed money, an **assembly** of representatives from different parts of
Virginia would meet. This assembly was called the House of Burgesses.
Members of the House of Burgesses would determine the best way to
raise money. They would propose taxes, and they would vote. If many
representatives thought the taxes were unfair, they would not vote for
them and, therefore, the taxes would not be approved. Because the
House of Burgesses included representatives from different parts of
Virginia, most everyone felt the process was fair.


**5**


- Read page 5 aloud.


**Inferential.** What was the Stamp Act, and how did the colonists feel about it?


» The Stamp Act required colonists to pay a tax when they bought printed materials

such as newspapers and books. The colonists were angry and thought the tax was

not fair.


- Explain to students that between the late 1600s and the mid-1700s, the 13
colonies enjoyed the British policy of salutary neglect, which meant Britain
turned a blind eye to trade violations. Britain did this because the colonies were
far away and difficult to police but also because everyone was prospering from
the trade. The Stamp Act brought an end to salutary neglect.



Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**22**


**Literal.** What were Great Britain’s new responsibilities and financial burdens?


» The British government borrowed a lot of money to fight the French and

Indian War and had to pay it all back. They also needed to continue to protect

the colonies.


**Inferential.** Why did the British government think the colonists should help pay the
money back?


» Great Britain spent a lot of money protecting the colonists and would have to

spend more money to keep protecting the colonies.


Lesson 1 The French and Indian War Brings Change
**23**


Every colony had an assembly similar to the Virginia House of
Burgesses. The assemblies weren’t all called the House of Burgesses, but
they did the same thing: a group of representatives met to discuss new
laws and taxes.


Although the colonists continued to raise their own taxes even after
1765, they felt that, rather than imposing a new tax on the colonies, the
king and his government should have asked these assemblies to find a
way to raise the money that was needed. Instead,
without even as much as a dialogue, the king and
his government created the Stamp Act. They did
not send it to the colonial assemblies, but directly
to Parliament, part of the British government
responsible for passing laws and raising taxes.


**The Stamp Act was** The colonists agreed that there were bills that
**very unpopular.**

had to be paid, and they wanted to contribute.
But they also wanted some say in how the money was raised. They
were concerned that important decisions about taxes were being
made thousands of miles away, by a parliament that had no colonial
representatives. This process didn’t seem fair to them.


Other regions outside of England, such as
Scotland, had representatives in Parliament. Their
job was to represent—and stand up for—the people
of Scotland. But there were no representatives from
the 13 colonies in Parliament. Not even one!



When the colonists became upset about the
Stamp Act, they expressed their unhappiness in
various ways. They held protest meetings. They
wrote pamphlets. They sent **petitions** to London.
They tried to explain why they thought the Stamp
Act was unfair.

**The Stamp Act was**

Challenge


Tell students that the
thirteen colonies that
rebelled against the Stamp
Act were not the only
British colonies in the
New World. Others existed
nearby in Canada, Florida
and in the Caribbean.
Although they also suffered
from the new British
taxes, these colonists
chose not to rebel. They
felt the benefits of their
relationship with Great
Britain outweighed the
cost of giving it up. Ask:
What do you think? Were
the thirteen colonies right
to rebel? Have students
write a response to the
questions and then share
their work with the class.





**Evaluative.** Why did the colonists feel the Stamp Act was unfair?


» Answers may vary, but should include that without asking the colonists for their

input, the king and British Parliament decided to require colonists to pay taxes

to repay money spent fighting the French and Indian War. The colonists did not

think it was fair that they were not represented in Parliament and were not asked

for their opinion about how to pay for the war. The colonists wanted a say in

the discussion about how the money was raised. The colonists were concerned

that important decisions about taxes were made by a government with no

colonial representatives.

Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share.** Based on the information in the text, what factors
may have contributed to the breakdown in relations between the British
government and the colonists?


**Inferential.** Did the colonists express their unhappiness with the Stamp Act in
peaceful or violent ways? Cite evidence from the text.


» Peaceful, by holding protest meetings, writing pamphlets, and sending petitions to

London are peaceful ways to protest.

**Discuss the Chapter and Wrap Up the Lesson**

- Use the following questions to discuss the chapter.



~~**TEKS 4.7.C**~~



**Note:** Question 1 relates to The Big Question of the chapter.


1. **Literal.** Why did the British government tax the colonists, and why did that

make the colonists angry?


» The British government borrowed a lot of money to fight the French and Indian

War and to protect the colonists. It needed money to repay debts. It passed the

Stamp Act, which worked like a tax because people paid it when they bought

specific items. This made the colonists angry because they did not have any

representation in Parliament or input into how the taxes were collected.


2. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share_ . Do you think the Stamp Act was fair? Do you

think the colonists should have paid their share?


» Answers may vary, but should include evidence from the text.

Who were the
Sons of Liberty?


» The Sons of Liberty
was a group of protestors
who made speeches
against taxes and the
British government.



**Inferential.** The Sons of Liberty led the cry, “No taxation without representation!”
What does the phrase “no taxation without representation” mean?


» The colonists had no representatives to stand up for them in the British

Parliament, where the decision to tax the colonists was made. They wanted a

voice in making decisions that affected them.



Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation

**Teapot celebrating the**
**repeal of the Stamp Act**


Tea was a popular drink in the colonies, just as it was in Great
Britain. However, many people decided they would not buy British tea
if they had to pay an unfair tax. And they thought the new tax on tea
was every bit as unfair as the old tax on paper. After all, the new tax had
been approved by the same British Parliament in London, and there
were still no representatives from the 13 colonies there.


Suddenly, deciding to take a sip of tea meant something more
than just having a drink. If you bought British tea, you were paying a
tax, and, **indirectly**, you were agreeing that Parliament had the right
to tax the colonies. On the other hand, if you refused to buy British
tea, you were making a statement of a different kind: you were saying
that you did not approve of—and would not accept—taxation without
representation.


Colonists who were angry about the new tax agreed not to buy
British tea. But they didn’t stop there. They also visited inns and other
places that sold tea and asked the owners to stop selling it. Many
establishments agreed to **boycott** British tea.


**11**


**Evaluative.** Why didn’t the British government’s repeal of the Stamp Act change the
way colonists felt?


» The British government repealed the Stamp Act but imposed a new tax in

its place. The new tax had been approved without colonial representation in

Parliament, just as with the Stamp Act. Again, the colonists had to pay a tax they

thought was unfair.


Lesson 2 Boycotts and Protests
**39**


In 1768, in response to the protests about the new taxes, the British
government sent soldiers to Boston to keep an eye on the Sons of
Liberty. Because the British soldiers wore red uniforms, the colonists
sometimes referred to them as “redcoats” or “lobster backs.”


In March 1770, several Bostonians got into a tussle with a redcoat.
The Bostonians surrounded the soldier and called him names. They
threw snowballs at him, and some members of the crowd even
threatened him with sticks and clubs.


More British soldiers arrived on the scene. They ordered the
Bostonians to go home, but the angry protestors refused. The situation
became more serious when even more people poured into the
streets. Soon a crowd of 300 angry Bostonians was pressing in on the
outnumbered British soldiers.


**12**


                - Have students read pages 12–14 silently.


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**40**


Some of the Bostonians shouted at the soldiers, daring them to fire
their guns. One of the Bostonians threw something at the soldiers. It
may have been a snowball. It may have been a rock. Whatever it was,
it hit one of the soldiers and knocked him down. Perhaps thinking his
life was in danger, the soldier fired his **musket** . One of the Bostonians
fought back, attacking the soldier with a club. After that, the other
British soldiers responded. They fired into the crowd. When it was over,
five people were dead.


The Sons of Liberty were outraged. They began making speeches
about the incident, which became known as the Boston Massacre. They
insisted that the Bostonians had been protesting peacefully and the
British had no reason to fire on them. One of the Sons of Liberty, a man
named Paul Revere, created an **engraving** that showed British soldiers
firing into a crowd of peaceful protestors. It was not an entirely **accurate**
picture of what had happened, but many colonists thought it was.

**41**


Support


Describe the incident that
became known as the
Boston Massacre.


» Answers may vary,
but should include
the fact that British
soldiers opened fire on
a crowd of protesters in
the streets of Boston.


Challenge


The future president,
John Adams, took on
the politically risky task
of defending the British
soldiers in court. Discuss
why he may have defended
these soldiers.


» Answers may vary, but
should include the fact
that he strongly believed
in doing what he thought
was right even if it was
not popular. John Adams
eventually developed many
ideas that formed the basis
of our democracy.



**Evaluative.** Do you think the British soldiers had good reason to fire on the
Bostonians? Support your answer with evidence from the text.


» Answers may vary, but may include: yes, because the British were outnumbered

and they were provoked by the angry crowd’s actions (shouting, taunting,

throwing objects, and hitting one of the soldiers); or no, because the Bostonians

were unarmed and unable to defend themselves.

**Think-Pair-Share.** Present to students: The Sons of Liberty did not
provide an accurate account of the Boston Massacre. Why do you think
they changed the story? Circulate through pairs and listen to students as
they develop their arguments, providing input as needed.


**Evaluative.** Why do you think the incident in Boston Harbor became known as the
Boston Tea Party?


» Answers may vary, but may include the fact that it is a metaphorical term. Tea is

drunk at a tea party. No tea was drunk, yet there was certainly enough tea in the

ocean for “the world’s largest tea party.”


**Literal.** Why did the Sons of Liberty dump chests of tea into the harbor?


» They had spent a lot of time and effort convincing the people of Boston not to buy

or sell British tea, and they were not going to let the captains unload all that tea.

When the captains did nothing, the Sons of Liberty decided to get rid of the tea so

they dumped it into Boston Harbor.

**Primary Focus:** Students will explain how to use cause and effect to describe

events that led to the American Revolution.

~~**TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.9.D.iii; TEKS 4.12.B**~~


~~**INTRODUCE CAUSE AND EFFECT (15 MIN.)**~~


                 - Tell students they will be writing a cause-and-effect essay for this unit. Today
you will introduce the concept of cause and effect as students begin the
planning stage of the writing process.


                - Refer to the Cause-and-Effect Poster you prepared in advance. Ask one student to
read the definition of cause and another student to read the definition of effect.


               - Share the following example of a simple cause-and-effect statement:


                        - Joshua put on his heavy winter coat because it was cold outside.


                - Have students identify the cause, or reason, which made Joshua put on his
heavy winter coat. Tell them to test their idea of what the cause is by asking if it
answers the question why? (Why did Joshua put on his heavy winter coat?)


                        - Cause: it was cold outside.


                - Have students identify the effect, or the thing that happened, because of it
being cold outside. Tell them to test their idea of what the effect is by asking if it
tells what happened. (What happened because it was cold outside?)


                        - Effect: Joshua put on his heavy winter coat.


                - Point out that the cause or effect may occur at the beginning or the end of the
sentence. For example, the following sentence means the same as the first
sentence, but is ordered differently:


                        - It was cold outside, so Joshua put on his heavy winter coat.


               - Refer to the Cause-and-Effect Chart you prepared in advance.


                - Have a student read the first item under “Cause.”


                - Ask students what effect staying in the sun too long without sunscreen
might have on someone.


» Answers may vary, but could include getting burned by the sun.


                 - Write “I got burned by the sun” in the first row of the chart under “Effect.”


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.9.D.iii** Recognize characteristics and structures of

- Have students formulate different sentences explaining this cause and effect.
For example:

    - Because I stayed out in the sun too long without sunscreen, I got burned
by the sun.


    - I got burned by the sun because I stayed out in the sun too long
without sunscreen.


- Next, refer to the second row in the “Effect” column and have a student read the
item.


- Tell students the balloon popped because of an event or circumstance. Ask
students to suggest why the balloon popped.

    - Answers may vary, but should include reasonable suggestions such as
being punctured by an object or bursting due to pressure of some sort
(heat).


- Write “Someone poked the balloon with a pin” under “Cause” on the second row
of the chart.


- Have students formulate different sentences explaining this cause and effect.
For example:

    - The balloon popped because someone poked it with a pin.


    - Because someone poked it with a pin, the balloon popped.


- Have students turn to Activity Page 2.4. Review the chart, noting that it includes
the two examples completed as a class.


- Have students complete the next row of the chart, filling in one effect for “the

Lesson 3 Voices of Discontent
**57**


**Note:** At this point in the school year, some or all of your students are likely

ready for the challenge of reading the entire chapter independently to

themselves, especially since this lesson is a rereading of the chapter they

read as a whole group yesterday. We encourage you to assign students to

read either independently or with partners, based on their needs.


~~**DISCUSS THE CHAPTER AND WRAP-UP (10 MIN.)**~~


                - Select one student from each pair to share answers to the assigned
questions. Discuss.


Check for Understanding


Distribute exit slips (can be blank half sheets of paper). Give students
three minutes to identify an American Revolutionary described in the
chapter with whom they strongly agree or strongly disagree. Have
students justify their opinions using a metaphor that captures their
agreement or disagreement and relevant evidence from the text.


                - Review the correct answers to Activity Page 3.1 with the whole class. You may
wish to select different students to read each question and share their response,
including the page number where the answer was located.


**Note:** Question 1 relates to The Big Question of the chapter.


1. There, angry crowds took their frustration out on tax collectors.


» Answers may vary, but should include that people got mad at the tax collectors

because they thought the taxes were unfair, and the tax collectors were the ones

who had to enforce payment of them. (page 10)


2. And they thought the new tax on tea was every bit as unfair as the old tax

on paper.


» Answers may vary, but should include that they believed the tax on tea was just as

unfair as the taxes on paper had been. (page 11)


3. In 1768, in response to the protests about the new taxes, the British

government sent soldiers to Boston to keep an eye on the Sons of Liberty.


» Answers may vary, but should include that the British government sent soldiers to

Boston to spy on the Sons of Liberty. (page 12)


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**58**


4. The situation became more serious when even more people poured into

the streets.


» Answers may vary, but should include that the situation got worse because more

angry people came out into the streets. (page 12)


5. Soon a crowd of 300 angry Bostonians was pressing in on the outnumbered

British soldiers.


» Answers may vary, but should include that a group of angry Bostonians

surrounded the British soldiers. (page 12)


- Tell students they will take home Activity Page 3.2 to read for homework.


~~**WORD WORK: ACCURATE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the chapter you read, “It was not an entirely accurate picture of what had
happened, but many colonists thought it was.”


2. Say the word _accurate_ with me.


3. _Accurate_ means “without mistakes,” or “having the right facts.”


4. Sam gave _accurate_ answers to all 10 of his math problems.


5. What are some other examples where it is important to provide _accurate_
information? Be sure to use the word _accurate_ in your response.


- Ask two or three students to use the target word in a sentence. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to make complete sentences: “My
cousin’s _accurate_ directions helped me find her house without any trouble.”


6. What part of speech is the word _accurate_ ?


» adjective


- Use a Synonyms and Antonyms activity for follow-up.


- What does _accurate_ mean? What are some synonyms of, or words that have a
similar meaning to, _accurate_ ?


  - Prompt students to provide words like _exact_, _precise_, and _right_ .


- What are some antonyms, or words that have the opposite meaning,
of _accurate_ ?


  - Prompt students to provide words like _incorrect_, _wrong_, _invalid_, and _faulty_ .


- As students discuss synonyms and antonyms, guide them to use the word
_accurate_ in a complete sentence: “An antonym of _accurate_ is _inaccurate_ .”

Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**70**


The Massachusetts Government Act declared that the people of
the colony were now under stricter control in terms of meetings and
electing their own officials. From that point on, the British king and his
ministers would make all decisions about which colonists would serve
in important positions in Massachusetts.


The Administration of Justice Act made new rules for trials.
Bostonians accused of a crime would no longer be tried in Boston by
fellow Bostonians. Instead, they would be sent either to another colony,
such as Canada, or even to London. They would also be tried in a
special Admiralty court by a judge handpicked by the king.


The Quartering Act declared that the colonists had to provide
quarters, or temporary places to live, for the British soldiers stationed
in the colonies. The colonists also had to provide supplies such as food,
bedding, candles, and firewood. This was significant because the British
government was getting ready to send more soldiers to Boston.


**Inferential.** Why were the British people and government shocked and angry when
they received the news about the Boston Tea Party?


» Answers may vary, but may include that they couldn’t believe the protesters had

dumped all the tea into the harbor; the loss of the tea represented a loss of money

for the British who had planned to sell the tea.


Lesson 4 Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death
**71**


**Literal.** How did British Parliament punish the colonists for the Boston Tea Party?


» British Parliament implemented a series of new laws: the Boston Port Act (closing

of Boston Harbor until colonists paid for destroyed tea); the Massachusetts

Government Act (meetings and the election of officials were under British

control); the Administration of Justice Act (trials would now be held outside

Boston and judges chosen by the king); and the Quartering Act (colonists had to

house and provide supplies to British soldiers.)


**Note:** It is not necessary or expected that students remember the specific names
of each act. What is important is that they get an overall sense that Britain decided
to punish the Massachusetts colonists, and that they be able to give at least one
example of what Britain did.


**Inferential.** How do you predict the colonists in Massachusetts responded to these
new laws? Support your answer with information you have read in earlier chapters.


» Answers may vary, but should be supported by evidence from the text.

Reread the sentence, “How
could they make a living if
goods could not be shipped
in or out of Boston?” _Make_
_a living_ means “to earn
money in order to live.”
Goods are products that
people make or sell to
earn money.




- Have students read page 21 silently.


**Literal.** Why did the people of Massachusetts call the new laws the Intolerable Acts?


» They called them the Intolerable Acts because they could not tolerate them; they

did not want to stand for, or accept, them.


If students do not recall what the core vocabulary word _intolerable_ means, explain the
root word in _intolerable_ is _tolerate_, which means “to stand for, or accept.” The prefix
_in_  - means “not.” Intolerable means “not able to stand for, or accept.” Another way to
phrase the definition of intolerable is “too painful or hard to be accepted.”



Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**74**


**Literal.** How did the other colonies respond when they heard about the new laws
Britain imposed on Massachusetts?


» They were angry and thought the same could happen to them. Twelve of the

thirteen colonies decided to send representatives to a meeting in Philadelphia

called the First Continental Congress.


Lesson 4 Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death
**75**


**Complaints and Grievances**

The 56 members of the First Continental Congress drafted a list of
complaints and **grievances** against the king and his government. They
agreed that all 13 colonies would stop **importing** goods from Great
Britain—not just tea and other items that were taxed, but all British
goods. They also agreed that, unless Parliament repealed the Intolerable
Acts, the colonies would stop **exporting** colonial goods to Great Britain.


Some colonists began to think a war was unavoidable. They
thought it was time to start **stockpiling** muskets and gunpowder.
Others believed that it was not too late to patch up relations with the
king and his government.


Representatives from Virginia debated this issue in March 1775.
Several representatives argued that Virginia should do whatever it
could to keep the peace and restore good relations with the king. But
others felt that it was too late for that. A country lawyer named Patrick
Henry proposed that it was time to stop talking about peace and to start
fighting for liberty:


Many people in Massachusetts agreed with Patrick Henry. They were
organizing militias, stockpiling guns, and preparing to fight. Some of the
Massachusetts militiamen were known as minutemen. These special troops
were created to be ready to fight at a moment’s notice!

The British government knew that these preparations were
underway. In response, they sent a large army to Boston. British
generals were told to confiscate any weapons they could find. They
were also told to find and arrest the biggest troublemakers among the
Sons of Liberty—Samuel Adams and John Hancock.


In April 1775, the British tried to capture some weapons that
members of the patriot movement had hidden in Concord, west of
Boston. Approximately 700 British soldiers marched out of Boston on
the night of April 18, hoping to surprise the militia in Concord. But the
patriots were watching every move the British soldiers made.


- Tell students “Let’s unpack what Patrick Henry was saying.” (Read or ask a
student to read each line of the speech, then pause to discuss the meaning of
his words.)


”Our brethren are already in the field!”


» Our brothers, or fellow colonists, are already having to endure unfair treatment by

the British.


”Why stand we here idle?”


» Why aren’t we doing anything? We must do something!


”Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains
and slavery?”


» Is it worth living under unfair rule just to have a quiet, peaceful life?

How did Paul Revere know
the British soldiers were
coming by boat?
» There were two lanterns
hanging in the belfry.



**The Night Rider**

One of the men keeping an eye on the British was Paul
Revere. He had heard that the British soldiers were getting
ready to march out to Concord. He knew there were only two
ways to get to Concord from Boston. One was to march there
on foot. The other was to cross the Charles River in boats
and then march the rest of the way. It was not possible to tell
which way the British would go until they set out. Revere
came up with a clever plan. He told a friend to hang lanterns
in the **belfry** of the North Church in Boston. If the soldiers
left Boston on foot, Revere’s comrade was to hang one lantern;
if they set off in boats, he was to hang two lanterns.


**Lantern** On the night of April 18, 1775, Revere’s friend ran up to

the belfry and hung two lanterns. Then, Revere and several other patriots
jumped into action. Revere got into a rowboat and rowed across the
Charles River—right past a British warship! Once he made it across, he
jumped onto a horse and set off along the same road the soldiers would
be taking. Paul Revere and other riders, including William Dawes and
Samuel Prescott, rode through the night to awaken the sleeping colonists.


Paul Revere, well-known for the popular cry, “The British are
coming!” never actually spoke those words, let alone yelled them
into the darkness. Today, historians believe it is more likely he quietly
warned colonists, “The regulars are coming out!” Paul Revere never
made it to Concord that night. But he did ride to Lexington to warn
Samuel Adams and John Hancock, who were wanted by the British and
in hiding there.


Because of Revere and the other riders, people who lived along the
road knew the British soldiers were headed toward Concord. Hundreds of
minutemen grabbed their guns and prepared to defend their homeland.

- Have students read page 24 silently.


**Inferential.** Why do you think it was important for Paul Revere and the others to know
which way the British were going to Concord?


» They needed to know which route they would take to Concord in order to warn the

colonists before the British arrived.

» Answers may vary, but may include that Paul Revere quietly warned colonists the

British soldiers were coming; he was not the only rider.

**Evaluative.** People now call the event described in this paragraph the “shot heard
’round the world.” Why do you think this event is called that?


» Answers may vary, but may include everyone in the world must have heard about

what happened because it is what started the Revolutionary War; it is a metaphor

for a small act of big significance.


                - Tell students the Revolutionary War was closely watched by Great Britain’s
enemies. The founding of the U.S. following the Revolutionary War heralded the
demise of tyrannical rule around the world and the rise of democracy.

**Note:** If there isn’t adequate time to complete this chapter, stop at the end of the
main text on page 28, omitting the two text boxes, “Georgia Stays Home” and “Two
Very Important Patriots.”


- Have a student read the box titled “Georgia Stays Home” on page 28 aloud.


**Literal.** Why did Georgia choose not to send a representative to the First Continental
Congress?


» Many Georgians did not want to get involved with the revolution because they

believed they had done well under the king’s rule.


- Tell students another reason Georgia did not participate in the First Continental
Congress was that the Creek Indians were attacking their borders so the
Georgia colonists needed the help of regular British soldiers. It is good practice
to read multiple sources when learning about a topic. Reading other sources
about the American Revolution will uncover a lot of other details not included in
the Reader.


**Inferential.** How did the British colonies in Canada respond to the laws imposed on
Massachusetts? What efforts did the British Parliament make to maintain loyalties in
their other colonies?


» Details students uncover may include: King George and the British Parliament

referred to the Intolerable Acts as the Coercive Acts. One of these acts, the

Quebec Act, extended Canada’s borders to the west into land the New England

colonists had hoped to settle. To gain the loyalty of the French Canadian colonists

who had been under British rule since the French and Indian War, the act

established French civil law and the Roman Catholic Church.

appearance; he did not have nice clothes; he did not have a lot of money.


**Literal.** Besides signing the Declaration of Independence, what else did you learn
about John Hancock from this text?


» Answers may vary, but may include he was a wealthy Boston merchant, a patriot

leader of the American Revolution; he demanded the removal of British troops from

Boston; a speech he gave at Crispus Attucks’s funeral led to an order for his arrest.

Remind students of the
following literary terms

is the repetition of ending
sounds; an end rhyme is
when words at the ends of
lines rhyme.

Paul Revere’s ride took
place in 1775 and Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow
wrote the poem in 1860,
so few people who had
witnessed Paul Revere’s
ride would have been
alive when the poem was
written (85 years later). It
is common for historical

into literary poems
and stories.

- Have students turn to Activity Page 5.1. Tell them they will read part of a
poem that relates to the historical events in the Reader. Explain that Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow wrote the poem “Paul Revere’s Ride” 85 years after the
actual ride by Paul Revere and others as a way to inspire American patriotism.


- Have students read the poem excerpts (three stanzas) silently. Then have a

student read the title, author, date, and first stanza aloud.

4. Hardly a man is now alive


5. Who remembers that famous day and year.


**Evaluative.** What does the title “From ‘Paul Revere’s Ride’” mean?



»



»



It is an excerpt from a larger body of work.



**Inferential.** This poem was first published in a literary magazine, so the original

historic event to future generations.



**Inferential.** What does it mean that “Hardly a man is now alive/Who remembers
that famous day and year”?



This poem was written a long time after that event, so not many people who were

into the horse’s sides to
make the horse run faster.




- Have a student read the first line of the third stanza aloud.


1. Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,


**Inferential.** To whom does the poem refer when it says “Meanwhile, impatient to
mount and ride,” and how do you know?


» The poem refers to Paul Revere. We know this because in the previous stanza, Paul

Revere says, “I on the opposite shore will be/Ready to ride and spread the alarm.”


- Have a student read the second line of the third stanza aloud.


2. Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride,


**Inferential.** What does it mean to say “Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride”?


» At this point in the poem, Paul Revere, wearing his boots with spurs, is pacing

impatiently back and forth.


- Have a student read the third line of the third stanza aloud.


3. On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.


**Inferential.** Where was Paul Revere according to the poem?


» He was on the opposite side of the Charles River, waiting for the signal in

the belfry.


- Have a student read lines 4–6 of the third stanza aloud.


4. Now he patted his horse’s side,


5. Now gazed on the landscape far and near,


6. Then impetuous stamped the earth,


**Inferential.** _Impetuous_ means “done without thinking; acting in an emotional way.”
What does it mean to say “Then impetuous stamped the earth”? [You may want to
demonstrate by stamping your foot loudly.]


» He is getting anxious; he stamped his foot on the ground in an emotional way.


- Have a student read lines 7–11 of the third stanza aloud.


7. And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;


8. But mostly he watched with eager search


9. The belfry-tower of the old North Church,


10. As it rose above the graves on the hill,


11. Lonely and spectral and somber and still.



Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation

**Inferential.** How does Paul Revere feel as he waits for the signal to warn the
colonists? Include examples from the parts of the poem read so far to support
your answer.


» Answers may vary, but may include that he feels impatient, nervous, eager;

“Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride” or “But mostly he watched with

eager search.”


**Inferential.** _Spectral_ means “ghostlike”; _somber_ means “sad and serious.” Why
might the belfry be described as lonely, spectral, somber, and still?


» These words convey the emptiness of the belfry as Paul Revere watched it eagerly,

waiting to see if one or two lanterns appeared. Because Revere was eager to see

the light of one or two lanterns, he must have been very aware of the stillness,

emptiness, quietness, and ghostlike nature of the dark tower.


 - Have a student read lines 12–16 of the third stanza aloud.


12. And lo! as he looks, on the belfry’s height,


13. A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!


14. He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,


15. But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight


16 A second lamp in the belfry burns!


**Inferential.** Why do you think Paul Revere springs to the saddle but then lingers
and gazes?


» When Paul Revere sees the first lantern in the belfry, he knows it is time for him to

alert the colonists about the British soldiers on the way, so he springs, or jumps

quickly, onto his horse. However, he also lingers and gazes at the belfry to see

whether his friend will hang a second lantern.

Authors often take creative

liberties when writing
literary works. Although the

poem is based on events

that actually took place,
many of the details may be

embellished or not entirely

factual. In fact, in the
years after this poem was

published, many people
mistakenly believed it to

be a factual account of
what happened the night
of April 18, 1775. However,

historians now know it to
be a memorable example
of patriotism and a popular

American legend.



~~**DISCUSS THE LESSON AND WRAP-UP (10 MIN.)**~~


**Evaluative.** Based on what you learned in the Reader about Paul Revere’s ride,
do you think the poem excerpt is historically accurate, meaning all the details in
the excerpt you read are exactly how they happened that night in 1775? Include
examples from the Reader text and the poem to support your answer.


» Answers may vary, but examples of inaccuracies might include that the poem

says Paul Revere was waiting on the opposite shore, though the Reader states

he had to row across the Charles River; the poem mentions Paul Revere as the

only rider that night, though the Reader states that two other men, William Dawes

and Samuel Prescott, accompanied Paul Revere; the poem implies that Revere

rode all the way to Concord, while the Reader states that he rode to Lexington to

warn Samuel Adams and John Hancock but never made it to Concord. Examples

of accuracies might include the date of the event (April 18, 1775); the purpose of

the ride (to warn the colonists to prepare for attack); and that Paul Revere was

successful in warning Samuel Adams and John Hancock.


Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share** Ask students, “Do you think people today would
still remember Paul Revere if Henry Wadsworth Longfellow had never
written the poem ‘Paul Revere’s Ride’?” Circulate and listen to partner
discussions. Provide guidance as needed.

6. What part of speech is the word _revolutionary_ ?


» adjective


 - Tell students: When the word _revolutionary_ is used as a proper noun, as in the
Revolutionary War or the American Revolution, it should be capitalized.


7. What makes a revolutionary war different from other wars? How is it

different from a civil war or coup d’etat?


» A revolutionary war is a fight whose goal is to bring about sudden and radical

transformation of an entire government system. Sometimes societies change

their government systems gradually over time, but this is considered _evolutionary_

change. Other types of war that bring change are _civil wars_ and _coups d’etat_ .


» A coup d’etat is an overthrow of the existing government by a small group that

disagrees with it. It does not change the government system, just the people in

charge of it.


» A civil war is a war between two groups within the same country. Usually civil wars

are fought over strong disagreements about government policy or because one

part of the country has such different interests that it wants to be independent.


» Historians have argued over whether the American Revolutionary War was really a

civil war.


8. What do you think?


» Use a Discussion activity for follow-up. Many revolutions have been fought

around the world, each one bringing about great change. Talk with your partner

about the changes the colonists thought were worth fighting for, and why these

changes could or could not be considered revolutionary. Be sure to use the word

_revolutionary_ in complete sentences as you discuss this with your partner.

What worried Prescott
when the British launched
an attack against them?


» He feared the militia
would run out of
ammunition.



The militia waited . . . and waited . . . and waited. Finally,
they opened fire. **Scores** of British troops fell to the ground.
Surprisingly, the redcoats were forced to retreat. The British
attacked a second time, but again they were beaten back. They
attacked a third time—and this time they were successful.
The militia had run out of ammunition. Now it was _their_ turn
to retreat.


Today this battle is known as the Battle of Bunker Hill.
However, that is an unusual name for a battle that was actually
fought on Breed’s Hill. It is possible that the confusion about
the location of the battle was caused by a lack of familiarity
with the area. The two hills are near each other. In fact, a
British officer who mapped the battle site mixed them up on
his map. It is also possible that Prescott had been ordered to
**fortify** Bunker Hill but fortified Breed’s Hill instead when he
realized that it was the more desirable spot.


In one sense, the Battle of Bunker Hill was a victory for
the British. They achieved their goal: they drove the militia off
the hill. In another sense, it felt more like a defeat. Is it really a
victory if 1,000 men are killed and wounded compared to 500
on the other side? The British knew that they could not afford
to continue to lose so many soldiers, even if the eventual
outcome was a victory!


While the Battle of Bunker Hill was raging outside
Boston, 56 representatives from all 13 colonies attended
the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Thomas
Jefferson came north to represent Virginia. John Adams,
Samuel Adams, and John Hancock made their way south from
Massachusetts. Benjamin Franklin, a native Bostonian living
in Philadelphia, did not have far to travel.


**32**


**Literal.** Why were the British generals worried when the colonial militia set up a
series of cannons overlooking Boston Harbor?


» They thought the militia might be able to fire on the British ships in the harbor

below and sink some of them.


**Inferential.** Was William Prescott, commander of the militia, right to be worried
when the British launched an attack against them? Support your answer with
evidence from the text.


» Yes, the militia ran out of ammunition and was forced to retreat after the British

soldiers’ third attack.

**Evaluative.** Do you think the Battle of Bunker Hill was a victory or a defeat for the
British troops?


» Answers may vary, but should be tied to the text, noting a victory for having

achieved the goal of driving the militia off the hill, or a defeat for having lost more

soldiers than the colonial militia.

**A Little Common Sense**


than anyone else to convince people to
declare independence was Thomas
Paine. Paine was an Englishman who
had moved to Philadelphia only a
few months earlier at the suggestion
of Benjamin Franklin. Franklin
thought Paine could help the patriot
movement. Thomas Paine wrote a
pamphlet called _Common Sense_ . It

Second Continental Congress was meeting.



**Thomas Paine**



Paine believed that monarchy was a foolish way to run a country.
“Mankind being originally equals in the order of creation,” Paine wrote;
so how could any one man claim the right to rule over millions?


Paine argued that the colonies should separate from Great Britain
and form a republic—a government made up of elected representatives.
He told his new countrymen they had an amazing opportunity—they
could cast off government by kings and replace it with something
much, much better:

Lesson 6 Declaring Independence
**115**


Support


Paine was British, so he
had firsthand experience

with a monarchy.



_Common Sense_ became a bestseller. Copies were printed in all 13
colonies. Selections were printed in newspapers. Those who could read
studied the pamphlet. Those who could not read listened while it was
read aloud at an inn or coffeehouse. _Common Sense_ convinced many
colonists that it was, in fact, time to declare independence.

**A Final Separation**

By June 1776, most members of the Second Continental Congress
were ready to vote for what Paine referred to as “a final separation.”
Thomas Jefferson, a delegate from Virginia, was asked to write an
official **declaration** of independence. His job was to explain why
the colonies were breaking away from Great Britain, and why it was
necessary for them to do so.


Benjamin Franklin and John Adams reviewed Jefferson’s draft.
They made a few changes, but overall they accepted Jefferson’s work
without reservation. On July 2, 1776, the members of the Second
Continental Congress voted for independence. On July 4, 1776, the
members voted again—this time on whether to accept Jefferson’s
Declaration of Independence as the document that outlined the reasons
for their desire to be independent. No one voted against it. One colony,
New York, **abstained** . The Declaration of Independence was approved!

**Inferential.** Why did Thomas Paine believe “that monarchy was a foolish way to
run a country”?

**No Simple Solution**

The colonists did not initially have a national army ready to fight
on their behalf. The Continental Army, as such, did not yet exist. In
June 1775, the Continental Congress appointed Virginian George
Washington to create such an army. Until then, the army had consisted
of a loosely organized collection of militia units from New England.
The **implications** of what had happened at Lexington and Concord
were far from clear in the days following the battles. While there had
been plenty of outrage, it had taken over a year for independence to
be declared. In fact, after the battles in Lexington and Concord, some
patriots had created a flag called “The Continental Colors.” This flag
featured the red and white stripes from the Sons of Liberty flag with an
image of the British Union Jack superimposed on it, indicating some

**Inferential.** The text says, “Jefferson wrote specific ideals that he and his fellow
colonists wholeheartedly believed to be true.” Look at the quote from Thomas
Jefferson on page 36, and find a word in the opening line that means the same as
_ideals_, or _beliefs_ .


» _truths_

**Evaluative.** Jefferson wrote: “We hold these truths to be self-evident . . .” In this
sentence, the word _self-evident_ means the truths require no proof or explanation.
The first truth, or belief, is that all men are created equal. What do you think this first
truth means?

Interpreting
Meaning



**Literal.** Jefferson continues, writing that all men are “endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable rights.” This means that God, the Creator, provides all people
with rights that cannot be taken away from them. Jefferson names three of these
unalienable rights. What are they?


» life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness


- Have students look at the image on pages 36 and 37.


**Inferential.** How does this image relate to the text? Where do you think the image is
set and whom do you think is pictured?


» Answers may vary, but should include the setting as the Second Continental

Congress in Philadelphia and some of the subjects of the painting as Thomas

Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams.


**Inferential.** When writing the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson
referred to the Intolerable Acts you read about in an earlier chapter. What references
to these acts are included in the text on page 38?


» “It had levied (demanded to collect) unfair taxes, taken away the right to trial by

jury, and quartered British troops in colonial cities.”


**Challenge.** What evidence does the text give to show that people were still
conflicted about declaring independence from Great Britain following the Battles of
Lexington and Concord?


» The flag created following the Battles of Lexington and Concord represented both

sides. The stripes represented a united desire to protect and defend the patriots’

liberties, and the Union Jack, or British flag, represented others’ continued loyalty

to Great Britain.


~~**DISCUSS THE CHAPTER (10 MIN.)**~~


- Use the following question to discuss the chapter.


**Note:** Question 1 relates to The Big Question of the chapter.


1. **Inferential.** What big decision did the colonists make as a result of shots

fired outside Boston and speeches delivered in Philadelphia? How did they

communicate this decision?


» to declare independence from Great Britain; by choosing Thomas Jefferson to

write an official declaration of independence


- Have students turn to Activity Page 6.2. Use the following questions to guide
students in adding these events to their timelines as you do so with the
displayed timeline:



Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**122**


2. **Literal.** What is the name of the battle in June 1775 that took place overlooking

Boston Harbor, in which the British drove back the colonial militia?


» the Battle of Bunker Hill


3. What is the name of the pamphlet published by Thomas Paine in January

1776 to help convince colonists to declare independence from Great

Britain?


» _Common Sense_


4. On what date did members of the Second Continental Congress vote to

adopt Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence?


» July 4, 1776


5. **Evaluative.** Provide a half-sheet of paper. Ask students to interpret the

meaning of “the pursuit of happiness” in the context of the thirteen

colonies in 1776. Remind them to write in complete sentences. Students

are expected to write legibly in cursive to complete assignments. Collect

papers from students.


» Answers will vary but should demonstrate an ability to think like the Founders

and generalize to a more abstract, virtuous idea. For example, not “to get rich”

or “to have a lot of fun” but instead “to become our best selves” or “to build a

strong country.”


6. **Literal.** What two historical documents did we discuss today?


» _Common Sense_, the Declaration of Independence


7. What are the rules for capitalizing historical documents?


» We capitalize the titles of historical documents.


As we continue reading, pay particular attention to the text and the patterns
of capitalization for historical documents, historical events, and nationalities.
This will help you as you draft your own writing.

~~**WORD WORK: TYRANT AND PERFIDY (20 MIN.)**~~


                 - Tell them that they will use dictionaries and thesauruses to find definitions and
synonyms for two words used in the Declaration of Independence to describe
King George III and his actions.


                 - Write the following on the board:

                      - perfidy

                      - tyrant – n., an unjust ruler


                 - Tell students they will have a chance to use a dictionary to define _perfidy_ and a
thesaurus to find synonyms for the word _tyrant_ .


                 - Think-Pair-Share. Review the definition of _tyrant_ . Remind students that
they learned about several actions taken by King George III and the British
Parliament. Then give them a few minutes to think about reasons the
Declaration of Independence refers to King George III as a tyrant.


                 - Have students discuss their ideas with a partner and then invite several pairs
to share their ideas with the class.


                 - Tell students that you will model using references to clarify the pronunciation
and meanings of two other words used in the Declaration of Independence to
describe bad acts by the British and King George the III.


                 - Model using a print or digital dictionary to find the definition, pronunciation
and part of speech of _obstruct_ .


                 - Model using a print or digital thesaurus to find synonyms for the word _harass_ .


                - Break the class into small groups and give each group access to a dictionary or
thesaurus (print or digital).


                - Have each dictionary group work to come up with the following for the
word _perfidy_ :

                      - a definition

                      - the part of speech

                      - pronunciation

                      - a sentence using the word


                - Have each thesaurus groups come up with the following for the word _tyrant_ :

                      - two synonyms for the word _tyrant_

                      - a sentence about King George that uses one of the synonyms


                - Circulate to help the groups as needed.


                 - Have the groups share their work with the class.

 - As you continue in the unit, consider assigning more reference work, in
class or as homework, related to vocabulary words from the Declaration
of Independence.


**Lesson 6: Declaring Independence**
###### Language 35m


~~**GRAMMAR (10 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students will demonstrate understanding of subject-action verb

agreement in the present tense. ~~**TEKS 4.2.A.iv; TEKS 4.11.D.i**~~


**Introduce Subject-Action Verb Agreement**

 - Remind students that a sentence has two parts, a subject and a predicate. The
subject tells who or what the sentence is about. The predicate tells what the
subject is doing, did, or will do. Verbs are part of the predicate.


 - Refer to the sentences on the board/chart paper:

  - Paul Revere warns the colonists.

  - The soldiers march toward Concord.


 - In the first sentence, have students identify the subject ( _Paul Revere_ ) and draw
a single line under it. Have students identify the predicate ( _warns the colonists_ )
and draw a double line under it. Have students identify the action verb ( _warns_ )
and draw a circle around it.


 - Follow this same process for the second sentence. (subject: _the soldiers_ ;
predicate: _march toward Concord_ ; action verb: _march_ )


 - Refer to the Subject-Action Verb Agreement Poster you prepared in advance.
Explain that the examples given on the poster are in the present tense (i.e., the
action is happening in the present, or now).


 - Point out the following:


  - If the subject is singular ( _the government_ ) and the action verb ends in _s, sh,_
_ch, x_, or _z_ (pass), add – _es_ to the verb ( _passes_ ).

  - If the subject is singular ( _Paul Revere_ ) and the action verb ends with _y_ ( _spy_ ),
change the _y_ to an _i_ and add – _es_ ( _spies_ ).


**TEKS 4.2.A.iv** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words using knowledge of prefixes; **TEKS 4.11.D.i**

  - Otherwise, if the subject is singular ( _the farmer_ ), add – _s_ to the verb ( _plows_ ).

  - If the subject is plural ( _the colonists_ ), it is not necessary to change the verb
( _fight_ ).


 - Direct students’ attention to the Subject-Action Verb Agreement Chart you
prepared in advance. Tell students you will complete the chart as a class.
Reference the Subject-Action Verb Agreement Poster as necessary. Combine
subjects with action verbs and write full phrases under “Agreement” on the chart.


 - Next have students help you orally extend the first example from the chart, _The_
_king rules_, into an expanded sentence.

  - Answers may vary, but should reflect the correct use of _The king rules_, and
should be a complete sentence. For example, _The king rules Great Britain and_
_the colonies_ .


 - Have students create an expanded complete sentence using two or three more
examples from the chart.


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 6.3. Review the directions and completed
examples in both sections of the activity page. Direct students to complete
the next item in the chart, and to write an expanded sentence for it. Circulate
around the room to be certain that students understand the directions. Have
students complete the remainder of the activity page for homework.


~~**MORPHOLOGY (10 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students will understand how the prefixes _im_ - and _in_ - modify root

words and will form new words and use those words in sentences. ~~**TEKS 4.3.C**~~


**Introduce Prefixes im– and in–**

 - Refer to the Prefixes Poster on display in the classroom and read the definition
of _prefix_ to students.


**TEKS 4.3.C** Determine the meaning of and use words with affixes such as mis-, sub-, -ment, and -ity/ty and roots such as
auto, graph, and meter.



Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**126**


 - Tell students the two prefixes they will study are _im–_ and _in–_ .


 - Write the prefix _im–_ on the board/chart paper and explain that it is pronounced
/im/. Write the prefix _in–_ on the board/chart paper and explain that it is
pronounced /in/.


 - Explain that _im–_ and _in–_ both mean “not.” Explain further that knowing the

meaning of specific prefixes will help students figure out the meaning of
unfamiliar words.


  - Remind students there are other prefixes that mean “not,” such as _un_ –, _non–,_
_dis–, il_ –, and _ir_ –.


  - Share the following examples of words with other prefixes that mean “not”:

_unoriginal, nondairy, dislike, illegal, irresponsible_ .


 - Tell students that adding _im_ - or _in_ - does not change the part of speech of the
word, but does change the meaning of the word.


  - Note that the prefix _im_   - is added to the beginning of words that begin with
the letters _m, p_, and _b_ . (These letters usually stand for the sounds /m/,
/b/, and /p/, which are made using the lips.) The prefix _in_   - is added to the
beginning of words that begin with most other letters.


 - Write the word “possible” on the board. Briefly discuss the meaning and then
use it in a sentence. ( _Possible_ means “able to be done.” It is _possible_ to finish
my homework before dinner. You may also want to point out that _possible_ can
also mean “able to become.”)


 - Add _im–_ to _possible_ and have students read the new word. Discuss the
meaning of the new word. (Impossible means “not able to be done or not able
to become.”) Point out that the prefix _im–_ does not change the part of speech
of _possible_ . Both _possible_ and _impossible_ are adjectives.


 - Refer to the example sentence for _impossible_ on the board/chart paper:


  - It is _impossible_ to fit the new table in the back of our small car.


 - Have students provide sentences using the word _impossible_ .


» Answers may vary.


 - Ask students for synonyms of _impossible_ .


» _unable, difficult_, etc.


 - Write _correct_ on the board. Briefly discuss the meaning of the word and then
use it in a sentence. ( _Correct_ means “true or accurate.” The _correct_ answer to
the math problem 4 × 11 is 44.)


Lesson 6 Declaring Independence
**127**


- Add _in–_ to _correct_ and have students read the new word; discuss the meaning
of the new word. ( _Incorrect_ means “not true or not accurate.”) Point out that
adding the prefix _in–_ does not change the part of speech of _correct_ . Both
_correct_ and _incorrect_ are adjectives.


- You may also want to explain that _correct_ can also be used as a verb (to _correct_ a
mistake) but that you are referring to _correct_ as an adjective for this lesson.


- Refer to the example sentence for _incorrect_ on the board/chart paper:


 - The student gave an incorrect answer.


- Have students provide sentences using the word _incorrect_ .


» Answers may vary.


- Ask students for synonyms of incorrect.


» _wrong, inaccurate_, etc.


- Continue in this manner for the remaining _im–_ and _in–_ words, using the
following chart as a guide.


**Note:** Do not write the information in the shaded columns on the board/

chart paper, as that information is intended for use during oral instruction.

Complete as many examples as time permits.

Check for Understanding


Ask students to hold a fist in front of their chests and give a thumbsup, thumbs-down, or thumbs-in-the-middle to indicate how well they
understand _im_        - and _in_        - affixes and how those affixes change root words.
Make a plan to pull confused students aside and reteach before the
next lesson.


- Have students turn to Activity Page 6.4. Briefly review the directions and

complete the first sentence together. Have students complete the activity page
for homework.

Lesson 6 Declaring Independence
**129**


Activity Page SR.1



~~**SPELLING (15 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students will practice spelling content-based spelling words by

using syllabic chunking to decode them. ~~**[TEKS 4.2.B.iv; TEKS 4.3.A](https://4.2.B.iv)**~~


**Introduce Spelling Words**

 - Explain that students will practice 10 words related to the content of the
Reader, _The Road to Independence_ . These words do not follow one single
spelling pattern. Tell students they will be assessed on these words and will
write a detailed sentence related to one or more of these words in Lesson 10.


 - Introduce the words by writing them on the board/chart paper. First say the
word aloud, and then sound out each syllable, naming each letter aloud as you
write it. Continue syllable by syllable until the word is spelled correctly, following
the guidance regarding syllable types and syllable division patterns. You may
wish to use the pronunciation chart to guide students in saying the words.


**Note:** Remember to point out specific spelling patterns in each word and

their relationship to the sounds and spellings on the Individual Code Chart

located in the Activity Book (Activity Page SR.1).


1. declaration 6. monarchy


2. grievance 7. representative


3. incident 8. surrender


4. independence 9. valiant


5. militia 10. victory


**Pronunciation/Syllabication Chart**

 - As you introduce and write each word, it may be helpful if you point out
particular spelling patterns within each word and show students where these
spellings are reflected on the Individual Code Chart. For example, you might
note that the word _declaration_ includes a schwa sound (/ /) in the second
syllable of the word (i.e., the vowel sound in the second syllable is pronounced
/ /, but spelled _a_ ) and then point out the _a_ spelling for / / that is included on
the Individual Code Chart located in the Activity Book (Activity Page SR.1).


**[TEKS 4.2.B.iv](https://4.2.B.iv)** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by spelling words using advanced knowledge of syllable division
patterns; **TEKS 4.3.A** Use print or digital resources to determine meaning, syllabication, and pronunciation.

|valiant|/val*y nt/|closed*|
|victory|/vik*t *ree/|closed* *open|



 - After writing and pronouncing the words, use the following chart to define each
word and provide an example of how to use it in a sentence.


**Note:** Do not write the information in the shaded columns on the board/

chart paper, as that information is intended for use during oral instruction.


 - Remind students that we can analyze words using syllable types and syllable
division patterns.


 - Write the word _declaration_ . Explain that when words have the ending - _tion_, this
is actually considered a final stable syllable and that they will be encountering
quite a few words within this unit that have that ending.


 - Model for students how to analyze words using syllable types and syllable
division patterns. For example, when writing the word grievance, underline the
vowel digraph _ie_ in the first syllable and _a_ and _e_ in the second syllable.


 - Remind them that the vowel digraph _ie_ makes the long _e_ sound. Model dividing
the word between the _v_ and _a_ and then read the word aloud to students.


 - Write the word _valiant_ . Have a student demonstrate underlining the vowel
sounds ( _al_, _i_, _a_ ). Guide students to notice the three vowel sounds making this a
three-syllable word. Ask another student to come up and divide the word into
syllables.


 - Point out that we divide this word between two vowels (val/i/ant).

Check for Understanding





Give students one minute to write the two words they think are the
hardest to spell and explain why. If any student claims they are all easy,
clarify with “The words that you think would be hardest for anyone to
spell.” They can do this in their notebooks. Circulate to see what students
write. Offer spelling strategies as appropriate.

Lesson 7 A Final Separation
**135**


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Reading**

                 - You will need to divide students into two small groups for this lesson. Decide
in advance which students will be assigned to Small Group 1 (in need of
scaffolding and support) and Small Group 2 (relatively independent).


                 - You will informally assess students in Small Group 1. If needed, create a tool for
recording anecdotal notes.


**Writing**

                 - Read through Vignette II on Activity Page 7.2 and decide how you will assign
roles to students. You will need one student to be the narrator, one student to
play King George III, four students to play members of Parliament, one student
to play Patrick Henry, and two students to play representatives from Virginia.
Assign the roles prior to class, allowing students time to prepare.


**Language**


Grammar; Morphology; Spelling


                 - Collect Activity Pages 6.3, 6.4, and 6.6 to review and grade, as there are no
grammar, morphology, or spelling lessons today.

Teacher Observation


Activity Page 7.1



**Establish Small Groups**

- Before reading the chapter, divide students into two groups using the
following guidelines:


  - Small Group 1: This group should include students who need extra
scaffolding and support to read and comprehend the text. Use the guided
reading supports to guide students through reading the text. This is an
excellent time to make notes in your anecdotal records. Students will
complete Activity Page 7.1 with your support while reading.


  - Small Group 2: This group should include students who are capable of
reading and comprehending text without guided support. We encourage
you to vary how you assign students to read, either independently or with
partners, based on their needs. Likewise, you may want to ask some or all of
your students to complete Activity Page 7.1 independently, which can then
be used as a formative assessment to determine how well each student
understood what was read. Make arrangements to check that students in
Small Group 2 have answered the questions on Activity Page 7.1 correctly.


~~**RE-READING “SHOTS AND SPEECHES” (30 MIN.)**~~


- The following guided reading supports are intended for use with Small Group 1.



Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**138**


 - Have students read the first paragraph on page 30 silently.


**Literal.** In the previous chapter, the text says that 73 British soldiers had been killed
and 174 wounded by the colonial militia during a day of fighting outside Boston. In
this paragraph, what vocabulary word is used when talking about both the dead and
the wounded soldiers?


» _casualties_


 - Read the remainder of page 30 aloud.


Lesson 7 A Final Separation

Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**140**


The militia waited . . . and waited . . . and waited. Finally,
they opened fire. **Scores** of British troops fell to the ground.
Surprisingly, the redcoats were forced to retreat. The British
attacked a second time, but again they were beaten back. They
attacked a third time—and this time they were successful.
The militia had run out of ammunition. Now it was _their_ turn
to retreat.


Today this battle is known as the Battle of Bunker Hill.
However, that is an unusual name for a battle that was actually
fought on Breed’s Hill. It is possible that the confusion about
the location of the battle was caused by a lack of familiarity
with the area. The two hills are near each other. In fact, a
British officer who mapped the battle site mixed them up on
his map. It is also possible that Prescott had been ordered to
**fortify** Bunker Hill but fortified Breed’s Hill instead when he
realized that it was the more desirable spot.


In one sense, the Battle of Bunker Hill was a victory for
the British. They achieved their goal: they drove the militia off
the hill. In another sense, it felt more like a defeat. Is it really a
victory if 1,000 men are killed and wounded compared to 500
on the other side? The British knew that they could not afford
to continue to lose so many soldiers, even if the eventual
outcome was a victory!


While the Battle of Bunker Hill was raging outside
Boston, 56 representatives from all 13 colonies attended
the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Thomas
Jefferson came north to represent Virginia. John Adams,
Samuel Adams, and John Hancock made their way south from
Massachusetts. Benjamin Franklin, a native Bostonian living
in Philadelphia, did not have far to travel.


**32**


 - Read page 32 aloud.


 - **Support.** _Score_ is another word for the number 20, so scores of troops means
multiples of 20, such as 2 × 20, 3 × 20, or 4 × 20; in other words, large numbers
of men fell to the ground. A score is an old word for a scratch that, in this
meaning, was made to record a count of 20.

Continental Congress?


» It suggests they worked to form a new government and lets the reader know this

is the key idea of the next few paragraphs.

**142**


**Inferential.** In what ways did the Second Continental Congress begin to alter their
behavior, acting independently from Great Britain?


» They began to function as their own government, asserting their rights to make

their own decisions by creating their own money and forming their own army and

postal service. They were part of a representative government, forming their own

rules rather than following the rules of a foreign government in which they had

no representation.

**A Little Common Sense**


than anyone else to convince people to
declare independence was Thomas
Paine. Paine was an Englishman who
had moved to Philadelphia only a
few months earlier at the suggestion
of Benjamin Franklin. Franklin
thought Paine could help the patriot
movement. Thomas Paine wrote a
pamphlet called _Common Sense_ . It

Second Continental Congress was meeting. **Thomas Paine**


Paine believed that monarchy was a foolish way to run a country.
“Mankind being originally equals in the order of creation,” Paine wrote;
so how could any one man claim the right to rule over millions?


Paine argued that the colonies should separate from Great Britain
and form a republic—a government made up of elected representatives.
He told his new countrymen they had an amazing opportunity—they
could cast off government by kings and replace it with something
much, much better:


**34**


Support - Read the first three paragraphs on page 34 aloud.



_Cast off_ means to throw
away or stop a way of
doing something.



**Literal.** What type of government did Thomas Paine think should replace
the monarchy?


» a republic; a government made up of elected representatives


- Have students record the answer to question 2 on Activity Page 7.1.



Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**144**


_Common Sense_ became a bestseller. Copies were printed in all 13
colonies. Selections were printed in newspapers. Those who could read
studied the pamphlet. Those who could not read listened while it was
read aloud at an inn or coffeehouse. _Common Sense_ convinced many
colonists that it was, in fact, time to declare independence.

**A Final Separation**

By June 1776, most members of the Second Continental Congress
were ready to vote for what Paine referred to as “a final separation.”
Thomas Jefferson, a delegate from Virginia, was asked to write an
official **declaration** of independence. His job was to explain why
the colonies were breaking away from Great Britain, and why it was
necessary for them to do so.


Benjamin Franklin and John Adams reviewed Jefferson’ s draft.
They made a few changes, but overall they accepted Jefferson’ s work
without reservation. On July 2, 1776, the members of the Second
Continental Congress voted for independence. On July 4, 1776, the
members voted again—this time on whether to accept Jefferson’ s
Declaration of Independence as the document that outlined the reasons
for their desire to be independent. No one voted against it. One colony,
New York, **abstained** . The Declaration of Independence was approved!

these famous words by
Thomas Jefferson many
times during their lifetime.
These words helped to

- Read page 36 aloud.


**Inferential.** Jefferson noted three inalienable rights of the people: life, liberty
(freedom), and the pursuit (search) of happiness. Which of these rights had Great
Britain taken away? Provide examples from your reading.


» Answers may vary, but students may identify the right to liberty (i.e., freedoms

taken away from the colonists, including the Intolerable Acts). They may also

identify the right to life, considering the colonists killed in the Boston Massacre,

Bunker Hill, etc.

Based on the way it is used
in the final sentence of this
paragraph, we can infer the

**Evaluative.** Do you agree with Jefferson’s conclusion that King George left the
colonists no other option but to declare independence from Great Britain?


» Answers may vary, but should be supported by the text.


- Have a student read the text box “Happy Birthday to Us!” on page 38 aloud.


**Inferential.** Why is July 4 called Independence Day?


» It is the day on which members of the Second Continental Congress voted

whether to accept Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence from Great Britain. So,

ever since then, this is the date that Americans celebrate their independence, or

freedom, from British control.

**No Simple Solution**

The colonists did not initially have a national army ready to fight
on their behalf. The Continental Army, as such, did not yet exist. In
June 1775, the Continental Congress appointed Virginian George
Washington to create such an army. Until then, the army had consisted
of a loosely organized collection of militia units from New England.
The **implications** of what had happened at Lexington and Concord
were far from clear in the days following the battles. While there had
been plenty of outrage, it had taken over a year for independence to
be declared. In fact, after the battles in Lexington and Concord, some
patriots had created a flag called “The Continental Colors.” This flag
featured the red and white stripes from the Sons of Liberty flag with an
image of the British Union Jack superimposed on it, indicating some

**Evaluative.** Look at the heading on page 39, “No Simple Solution.” What does the
heading mean, and does it accurately represent what the paragraph is about?
Support your answer with evidence from the text.


» Answers may vary, but may include that the problem the colonists faced—to

remain under British rule or to declare independence—was not an easy one to

solve. This paragraph discusses the colonists’ conflicted feelings, as evidenced by

the length of time it took to actually declare independence after the Declaration of

Independence was written.

 - Use the following question to discuss the chapter.


**Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share_ . Have you ever heard the idiom “Actions speak louder
than words”? It means that what you do is more important than what you say. In
this chapter, you read about the actions (shots) of the militia and words (speeches)
of the members of the Second Continental Congress. Which was more essential—
actions or words—in the colonists’ decision to go to war with Great Britain? Turn
and share your opinion with a partner.


» Answers may vary, but should draw support from the text. Students may conclude

that shots were more important because of the loss of life or that speeches were

more important because they represented a majority opinion from all 13 colonies.


Check for Understanding


Give students a choice: 1) In one minute, describe the most meaningful
thing you’ve learned from this chapter, or 2) in one minute, write what
most confuses you. Provide half-sheets of paper or allow students to write
in their notebooks. Circulate to see what students are writing, providing
feedback and clarification as needed. Remind students to capitalize
historical documents, nationalities, and historical events. This can be used
as a formative assessment to determine who may need additional support

Armies of trained soldiers
march or fight “in
formation.” That phrase
means that they arrange
themselves in lines or a
particular order and learn
to march forward together
to fight their enemies.



**Literal.** Why were the British confident they could defeat the colonists at the
beginning of the war?


» The British had more soldiers, cannons, and ships, and they had much more experience.


**Literal.** Who fought in the Continental Army?


» The Continental Army was made up of farmers and shopkeepers, among others.


**Literal.** Military leaders usually have a strategy for how to defeat the enemy. What
was the British army’s strategy?


» They planned to divide the colonies in half and fight them on two fronts.

**Crossing the Delaware**

Having retreated from Boston, the British turned their attention to
New York City. They recognized the **strategic** importance of this port
city. If their plan to gain control was to succeed, they needed to capture
it. However, George Washington was equally aware of the importance
of having control of New York City. He marched his troops there to
**confront** the British army.


In the summer of 1776, the British and Continental armies engaged
in a battle on Long Island and Manhattan Island. George Washington and
his men failed to keep New York City out of British hands. By November
1776, having lost New York City, George Washington retreated along
the Hudson River and then into New Jersey. Washington knew his army
was simply not as strong as the British army. If he tried to challenge the
British in a major battle, he knew he would lose. He would have to look
for opportunities to attack when his enemies were not expecting it.


On December 25, 1776, that is exactly what Washington did. It was
Christmas night, and the Hessian troops who were camped in Trenton,

The Hessians were soldiers
who were paid to help the
British fight the colonists.


Lesson 8 The Continental Army’s Plight
**161**


New Jersey, had been on round-the-clock alert for over a week. They were
exhausted. Finally, they had been allowed to sleep. Because they were not
expecting an attack on Christmas night, many were unarmed.


Washington crossed the Delaware River from Pennsylvania and
took the Hessians completely by surprise. More than 1,000 of them
were forced to **surrender** in the sneak attack.


The victory at Trenton was extremely good for the **morale**
of Washington’ s troops, but it was followed by a string of defeats.
Washington and his men were defeated at the Battle of Brandywine in
September 1777 and again at the Battle of Germantown in October. At
Germantown, some of the soldiers in the Continental Army became
confused and fired on their own troops. Because of these defeats, the
British were able to capture Philadelphia. The Continental Congress
was forced to break up and relocate to another city.


Farther north, a British army marched down from Canada, recaptured
Fort Ticonderoga, and began to close in on the Continental Army fighting
in this area. The Continental Army was in trouble. It was time to retreat
and regroup—but the British were right behind them.


**Literal.** Why did the British focus on New York City?


» New York was strategically important because of its port.


**Literal.** Recall how Washington and his army surprised the Hessians in Trenton.


» They attacked them on Christmas night when the Hessian troops were sleeping.


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**162**


**Evaluative.** Look at the image “Washington Crossing the Delaware” on pages 42
and 43. What does Washington’s posture and placement in the boat tell you about
his position in the army?


» Answers may vary, but may include that Washington is important because he

does not have to row the boat; he is standing with one foot resting on the boat’s

edge looking across the river. This suggests he is thinking deeply and searching

for shore; he is the tallest figure in the image and is close to the middle, suggesting

that he is important. An artist would say Washington is the focal point of the

painting because the eye is drawn to him first.


**Challenge.** This image shows Washington staring across the river during an
important moment in the Revolutionary War. The image suggests that he has great
vision. When someone has great vision, it means they can see the consequences or
potential in a situation. How might Washington be described as having
great vision?


» Washington was able to see beyond individual battles and realize that his army

may lose sometimes, or even frequently, but that it could still win the war. He used

creative techniques and also paid attention to morale, or how his troops felt.


**Evaluative.** Why do you think Washington is not rowing the boat?


» He was the leader of the army and too important to row the boat.


Lesson 8 The Continental Army’s Plight

**Outsmarting the Enemy**

The Continental Army also needed a plan. Fortunately, a man
named Tadeusz Kościuszko had one. Kościuszko was a Polish
engineer who had joined the colonists in their fight for independence.
Kościuszko shared certain strategies that the Continental Army might
use to slow down the British army.


At Kościuszko’s suggestion, the Continental soldiers cut down trees
and let them fall across roads as they retreated. They destroyed bridges,
and they built dams so rivers would overflow onto the roads.


These **tactics** gave the soldiers time to set up defenses near
Saratoga, New York. Kościuszko played an important role in that, too.
He suggested the best defensive spots to build forts, thus preventing
the British from continuing south to Albany. He also taught the
Continental soldiers how to build strong defensive walls.


In September 1777, the British attacked the forts near Saratoga.
Despite repeated efforts, they were not able to break through the
Continental Army defenses. On October 17, the British general
surrendered. More than 6,000 British soldiers handed over their weapons.
The Battle of Saratoga was the first big victory for the Continental Army.


In December 1777, Washington and his tired men limped into the
Pennsylvania town of Valley Forge. Washington had decided that his army
would spend the winter there. In those days, armies scaled back fighting
during the winter. That winter, Washington’s army had to face another
enemy—Mother Nature.


Mother Nature was not kind to the Continental Army during the
winter of 1777 to 1778. It was a bitterly cold winter, and the soldiers were
not prepared for it. Most of them did not have winter coats. Many did not
even have shoes. Their injured feet left bloody footprints in the snow.

strategies were successful.

**Evaluative.** Using evidence from the image on page 45, what details support the
idea that the soldiers were miserable that winter?


» Answers may vary, but may include that the soldiers are outside. They are wearing

what looks like coats but they don’t look very thick, and the ground is covered with

snow. One soldier is warming himself by a fire; the sky looks gray and bleak, and

nighttime must be coming because the clouds are turning colors as the sun sets.

**166**



During December and January, the soldiers cut down trees and
used them to build log cabins. These cabins provided some shelter from
the cold, but they were crowded and damp.


There were other problems, too. The soldiers did not have enough
to eat. They had to survive for many weeks on firecake, a tasteless
mixture of flour and water baked over a fire. Occasionally, they might
have a bowl of pepper pot soup, a thin broth made from beef and a
handful of peppercorns.


Clean drinking water was also in short supply. Many soldiers drank
dirty water and got sick. A few died of frostbite or starvation; many
more died as a result of diseases.


One army surgeon, Albigence Waldo from Connecticut, kept a
diary during his time in Valley Forge. Here is an excerpt from his diary:


George Washington was worried about the state of the army.
On December 23, 1777, he wrote a letter to the Continental Congress
explaining that many of his men were in such poor health that they
were no longer fit for combat. The situation was so bad, Washington
wrote that he was worried that his men might give up and go home:

Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


As the New Year dawned in 1778, things looked **bleak** for George
Washington and the Continental Army. However, the tide was
beginning to turn in their favor.


**Among Washington’s men at Valley Forge was a young French nobleman named the**
**Marquis de Lafayette. Lafayette was to have a prominent role in the Revolutionary War.**


**47**


**Inferential.** Why is Mother Nature referred to as another enemy?


» The weather and conditions were dangerous and many men died from disease,

frostbite, and hunger. During that winter, nature was more dangerous to

Washington’s troops than the British army.


**Literal.** According to the text, Washington was worried about the health of his
soldiers. What else worried him?


» Washington was concerned that the soldiers would simply leave the army

and go home.

» “A force to be reckoned with” means someone or something is intimidating

or powerful and would be difficult to defeat. Here, the author means that the

Continental Army was not very threatening.


**Inferential.** What can be inferred from the statement that the Continental Army
was made up of “farmers and shopkeepers”?


» The Continental Army was less prepared than the British army. Farmers and

shopkeepers were not professionally trained to be in the military, unlike many of

the British soldiers and mercenaries, who had full-time military careers.

**Inferential.** Which phrase is an example of foreshadowing? In other words, which
phrase suggests that, although the Continental Army was not intimidating at the
beginning of the war, things would change?


» The phrase “at least at first” indicates that the Continental Army would get

stronger as the war progressed.

**Crossing the Delaware**

Having retreated from Boston, the British turned their attention to
New York City. They recognized the **strategic** importance of this port
city. If their plan to gain control was to succeed, they needed to capture
it. However, George Washington was equally aware of the importance
of having control of New York City. He marched his troops there to
**confront** the British army.


In the summer of 1776, the British and Continental armies engaged
in a battle on Long Island and Manhattan Island. George Washington and
his men failed to keep New York City out of British hands. By November
1776, having lost New York City, George Washington retreated along
the Hudson River and then into New Jersey. Washington knew his army
was simply not as strong as the British army. If he tried to challenge the
British in a major battle, he knew he would lose. He would have to look
for opportunities to attack when his enemies were not expecting it.


On December 25, 1776, that is exactly what Washington did. It was
Christmas night, and the Hessian troops who were camped in Trenton,


- Have students read page 42 and the first sentences on the top of
page 43 silently.


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


New Jersey, had been on round-the-clock alert for over a week. They were
exhausted. Finally, they had been allowed to sleep. Because they were not
expecting an attack on Christmas night, many were unarmed.


Washington crossed the Delaware River from Pennsylvania and
took the Hessians completely by surprise. More than 1,000 of them
were forced to **surrender** in the sneak attack.


The victory at Trenton was extremely good for the **morale**
of Washington’s troops, but it was followed by a string of defeats.
Washington and his men were defeated at the Battle of Brandywine in
September 1777 and again at the Battle of Germantown in October. At
Germantown, some of the soldiers in the Continental Army became
confused and fired on their own troops. Because of these defeats, the
British were able to capture Philadelphia. The Continental Congress
was forced to break up and relocate to another city.


Farther north, a British army marched down from Canada, recaptured
Fort Ticonderoga, and began to close in on the Continental Army fighting
in this area. The Continental Army was in trouble. It was time to retreat
and regroup—but the British were right behind them.


**Literal.** Who won the battle on Long Island? Use evidence from the text to support
your answer.


» The British won the battle. We know this because the text says Washington “failed

to keep New York City out of British hands” and that he “retreated.”


**Inferential.** The topic sentence in the third paragraph on page 42 says, “that is
exactly what Washington did.” What did Washington do?


» He attacked when the British were not expecting it.

Challenge


What are some synonyms,
or words that have
the same meaning, for
_limped_ that convey the
feelings, physical state of
the soldiers?


» Answers may vary, but
may include _dragged_
_themselves_, _hobbled_,
_stumbled_, _lurched_,
or _staggered_ .


**182**




- Have students read page 44 silently.


Check for Understanding


Ask students: Take one minute to think, then describe how Tadeusz
Kociuszko helped the Continental Army. Do you think his help made a
big impact or a small impact in the war against the British? Explain your
thinking. Provide additional response time, as needed. Check to see
how quickly and fluently students can answer the question. Review the
contents of page 44 if needed.


**Inferential.** In the first sentence of the fifth paragraph on page 44 of the Student
Reader, what does the word _limped_ imply about the condition the soldiers were in
when they arrived at Valley Forge?


» The verb _limped_ conveys the fact that the soldiers were exhausted and possibly

injured from the difficult fight at the Battle of Saratoga.


**Evaluative.** _Personification_ is a literary device whereby the author assigns human
characteristics to something nonhuman. Locate an example of personification in
the last paragraph and explain how it is an example of personification.


» “Mother Nature was not kind to the Continental Army during the winter of 1777

to 1778” is an example of personification because it describes nature (which is

nonhuman) as a mother and as being unkind to the army (when only humans can

be kind or unkind to others).


**Evaluative.** Instead of, “Their feet hurt,” the Reader states, “Their injured feet left
bloody footprints in the snow.” Which sentence is more effective and why?


» The second sentence is more effective because the author uses imagery to paint a

vivid picture of the soldiers’ suffering. The phrase “bloody footprints in the snow”

shows that the soldiers were in pain and bleeding. It also contrasts their suffering

with the clean, white snow.


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


**Outsmarting the Enemy**

The Continental Army also needed a plan. Fortunately, a man
named Tadeusz Kościuszko had one. Kościuszko was a Polish
engineer who had joined the colonists in their fight for independence.
Kościuszko shared certain strategies that the Continental Army might
use to slow down the British army.


At Kościuszko’s suggestion, the Continental soldiers cut down trees
and let them fall across roads as they retreated. They destroyed bridges,
and they built dams so rivers would overflow onto the roads.


These **tactics** gave the soldiers time to set up defenses near
Saratoga, New York. Kościuszko played an important role in that, too.
He suggested the best defensive spots to build forts, thus preventing
the British from continuing south to Albany. He also taught the
Continental soldiers how to build strong defensive walls.


In September 1777, the British attacked the forts near Saratoga.
Despite repeated efforts, they were not able to break through the
Continental Army defenses. On October 17, the British general
surrendered. More than 6,000 British soldiers handed over their weapons.
The Battle of Saratoga was the first big victory for the Continental Army.


In December 1777, Washington and his tired men limped into the
Pennsylvania town of Valley Forge. Washington had decided that his army
would spend the winter there. In those days, armies scaled back fighting
during the winter. That winter, Washington’s army had to face another
enemy—Mother Nature.


Mother Nature was not kind to the Continental Army during the
winter of 1777 to 1778. It was a bitterly cold winter, and the soldiers were
not prepared for it. Most of them did not have winter coats. Many did not
even have shoes. Their injured feet left bloody footprints in the snow.

Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


During December and January, the soldiers cut down trees and
used them to build log cabins. These cabins provided some shelter from
the cold, but they were crowded and damp.


There were other problems, too. The soldiers did not have enough
to eat. They had to survive for many weeks on firecake, a tasteless
mixture of flour and water baked over a fire. Occasionally, they might
have a bowl of pepper pot soup, a thin broth made from beef and a
handful of peppercorns.


Clean drinking water was also in short supply. Many soldiers drank
dirty water and got sick. A few died of frostbite or starvation; many
more died as a result of diseases.


One army surgeon, Albigence Waldo from Connecticut, kept a
diary during his time in Valley Forge. Here is an excerpt from his diary:


George Washington was worried about the state of the army.
On December 23, 1777, he wrote a letter to the Continental Congress
explaining that many of his men were in such poor health that they
were no longer fit for combat. The situation was so bad, Washington
wrote that he was worried that his men might give up and go home:

As the New Year dawned in 1778, things looked **bleak** for George
Washington and the Continental Army. However, the tide was
beginning to turn in their favor.


**Among Washington’s men at Valley Forge was a young French nobleman named the**
**Marquis de Lafayette. Lafayette was to have a prominent role in the Revolutionary War.**

worried about the state of the army.

**Literal.** What words or phrases provide clues about the meaning of _state_ ?


» poor health; no longer fit for combat; situation was so bad


**Literal.** The text reads “[Washington] wrote a letter to the Continental Congress
explaining that many of his men were in such poor health that they were no longer
fit for combat.” Restate this sentence in your own words.


» He wrote a letter to the Continental Congress to tell them that his soldiers were so

sick they could not/would not be able to fight the British.

~~**DISCUSS THE CHAPTER AND WRAP-UP (5 MIN.)**~~


- Use the following question to discuss the chapter.


**Note:** Question 1 relates to The Big Question of the chapter.


**Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share_ . At the beginning of the war, it seemed the British were
most likely to win the war. However, the end of this chapter suggests the British
might not win the war after all. What words or phrases in the text suggest the British
might not win the war?


» The last sentence of the chapter says, “However, the tide was beginning to turn

in their favor.” In this sentence _their_ refers to the Continental Army. This means

changes were going to occur that would favor, or benefit, the Continental Army.


~~**WORD WORK: CONFRONT (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the chapter you read, “George Washington marched his troops there to
confront the British army.”


2. Say the word _confront_ with me.


3. _Confront_ means to challenge or fight against.


4. When I discovered that my brother had been hiding my blocks, I decided to
confront him and ask where he hid them.


5. What are some other examples of _confront_ ? Be sure to use the word _confront_
in your response.


- Ask two or three students to use the target word in a sentence. If necessary, guide
and/or rephrase students’ responses to make complete sentences: “When I heard
about, I decided to confront .”


6. What part of speech is the word _confront_ ?

Check for Understanding


**Think-Pair-Share.** Direct students: Talk with your partner about a time
when you or someone you know confronted someone about an idea,
misunderstanding, or problem. Be sure to use the word _confront_ in
complete sentences as you discuss this with your partner. Rotate and
correct grammar and usage as needed.

**Primary Focus:** Students will demonstrate understanding of subject-action verb

agreement in the present tense. ~~**TEKS 4.11.D.i**~~


**Introduce Pronoun-Action Verb Agreement**

- Tell students that in this lesson they will learn about pronoun-action verb
agreement.


- Ask students what a pronoun is. (A _pronoun_ is a word that can be used in place
of a noun. Pronouns include: _I_, _you_, _he_, _she_, _it_, _we_, and _they_ .)


- Refer to the Pronoun-Action Verb Agreement Poster you prepared in advance.
Explain that the examples given on the poster are in the present tense (that is,
the action is happening in the present, or now).


- Point out the following:


    - If the subject is the pronoun _it_, _he_, or _she_ and the action verb ends in ‘s’,
‘sh’, ‘ch’, ‘x’, or ‘z’ (catch), add – _es_ to the verb (catches).


   - If the subject is the pronoun _it_, _he_, or _she_ and the action verb ends with ‘y’
(dry), change the ‘y’ to an ‘i’ and add – _es_ (dries).


   - Otherwise, if the subject is the pronoun _it_, _he_, or _she_, add – _s_ to the
verb (hums).


   - If the subject is the pronoun _I_, _we_, _you_, or _they_, it is not necessary to change
the verb (prepare).


- Direct students’ attention to the Pronoun-Action Verb Agreement Chart you
prepared in advance. Tell students you will complete the chart as a class.
Reference the Pronoun-Action Verb Agreement Poster as necessary. Combine
pronouns with action verbs and write full phrases in the “Agreement” column of
the chart.


**TEKS 4.11.D.i** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including complete simple and compound sentences with
subject-verb agreement and avoidance of splices, run-ons, and fragments.

- Next, have students help you orally extend the first example from the chart,
“I learn,” into an expanded sentence.


    - Answers may vary, but should reflect the correct use of “I learn,” and

should be a complete sentence. For example, I learn about why the
colonists wanted to be free from British rule.


- Have students create an expanded complete sentence using two or three more
examples from the chart.


- Have students turn to Activity Page 9.1. Review the directions and completed Activity Page 9.1
examples in both sections of the activity page. Direct students to complete
the next item in the chart, and to write an expanded sentence for it. Circulate

- Briefly review the prefixes _im_ - and _in_ - that you added to the poster in Lesson 6.
Remind students the prefixes _im_  - and _in_  - both mean “not.”


- Ask students to answer the following Multiple Choice Question.


~~**TEKS 4.2.A.iv; TEKS 4.3.C**~~


Which sentence uses the correct affix to clearly express the idea?


A. Alma wanted to bring her favorite novel on the hike, but it was heavy and
impractical.


B. Marcos was proud of his drawing, even though it was inperfect, because he
had done his best.


C. Renya was embarrassed by her sister’s inpolite request for a piece of her
neighbor’s freshly baked pie.


D. Shan wanted to beat his record for running a mile during this year’s PACER
test, but his broken leg made it inpossible.


- After students consider the options, identify A as the correct answer.


- Remind students the prefixes _im_ - and _in_ - are added to root words that are
adjectives. The prefixes _im_  - and _in_  - do not change the part of speech of the
new words; the new words are also adjectives.


- Remind students that the prefix _im_ - is added to the beginning of words that
begin with the letters ‘m’, ‘b’, and ‘p’. (These letters usually stand for the sounds
/m/, /b/, and /p/, which are made using the lips.) The prefix _in_  - is added to the
beginning of words that begin with most other letters.


- Refer to the word lists you prepared in advance.


   - _im_   - impossible, imperfect, impractical, impatient, impolite


   - _in_   - incorrect, inconvenient, incomplete, incapable, inactive


- Have one student read the _im–_ words aloud: _impossible_, _imperfect_, _impractical_,
_impatient_, _impolite_ . Have another student read the _in–_ words aloud: _incorrect_,
_inconvenient_, _incomplete_, _incapable_, _inactive_ .


- Tell students you will read some sentences aloud, but will leave a word out.
Students must decide which word from the list best completes the sentence.


- Read the following sentences aloud and have students identify the missing word
for each:


    - It was to go home before soccer practice because we were already

By 1773, the colonists had been living with unfair taxation for many years.

The Stamp Act had been repealed, but the British government imposed
new taxes on the colonists. When the British imposed a tax on tea, the
colonists boycotted, refusing to buy British tea. Led by the Sons of Liberty,
a group of patriots protested and tossed tea into Boston Harbor.


- Continuing to think aloud, tell students that you are going to check to see

whether you have included the necessary information found in the “Body”
section for paragraph 1 in your response to the writing prompt. Model how to
add content to the paragraph, writing on the board/chart paper.


- Note the first item in the rubric: repeal of the Stamp Act.


  - Ask a student to read the sentence where you included the repeal of the

Stamp Act: “The Stamp Act had been repealed, but the British government
imposed new taxes on the colonists.”

  - Have students check their own response to the writing prompt. If they did

not include the repeal of the Stamp Act, have them circle it on the rubric as a
reminder that they need to do so.

- Note the second item in the rubric: the Boston Massacre.


  - Ask a student to read the sentence where you included the Boston Massacre

(this is not included). Tell students you did not include this information, so
you will add it now. After the second sentence, insert “Angry crowds gathered
in the streets of Boston, and the British soldiers opened fire, killing five
patriots. This incident became known as the Boston Massacre.”

  - Have students check their own response to the writing prompt. If they did not

include the Boston Massacre, have them circle it on the rubric as a reminder
that they need to do so.

- Note the third item in the rubric: the Boston Tea Party.


  - Ask a student to read the sentence(s) where you included the Boston Tea

Party: “When the British imposed a tax on tea, the colonists boycotted,
refusing to buy British tea. Led by the Sons of Liberty, a group of patriots
protested and tossed tea into Boston Harbor.”

  - Have students check their own response to the writing prompt. If they did not

include the Boston Tea Party, have them circle it on the rubric as a reminder
that they need to do so.

Lesson 10 The French Intervention



**205**


Von Steuben taught the Continental
soldiers how to march and stand in
formation. He taught them how
to advance on the battlefield. He
also taught them how to use the
**bayonets** attached to their muskets.
Von Steuben trained a **model**
**company** . Then, the members
of this model company trained
other companies.


Things began to improve in
the spring of 1778. Washington sent
out **foraging** parties to gather cattle, horses, **Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben**
corn, hay, and grains from the local people.
They returned with enough food to feed the soldiers at Valley Forge.
Washington also appointed a new quartermaster whose job was to make
sure the army did not run out of food or supplies. And, last but not least,

Washington convinced the Continental Congress to

send more money and to **recruit** more soldiers.



**Lord Cornwallis**



By the time the Continental Army
marched out of Valley Forge in June
1778, they were much better prepared
to fight as an army. The newly trained
Continental Army began to win more
battles. Their first **decisive** victory came
in the fall of 1781. At this point, much of

the fighting had shifted south to Virginia

and the Carolinas. British troops in the south
were led by Lord Cornwallis.

between France and Great

Britain caused the British

**Literal.** What European country joined the Continental Army to fight the British
and why?


» France joined the Continental Army to fight the British because it was a longtime

enemy of Great Britain.


**Inferential.** How do you think the colonists felt about French involvement in the war
and why?


» Answers may vary, but may include that the colonists felt happy or excited about

France’s involvement because France had a strong, organized military, whereas

the colonists did not.


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


**Evaluative.** Why was the time the Continental Army spent in Valley Forge significant?


» Von Steuben trained the Continental Army to be more professional—marching

and standing in formation, advancing on the battlefield, using weapons, and

training other companies. In addition, food and supplies were better managed, so

they didn’t run out. Washington was able to convince the Continental Congress

to send more money and recruit more soldiers. The Continental Army was much

better prepared to fight as an army than when they first arrived at Valley Forge.

**The Beginning of the End**

In August 1781, Cornwallis and his men camped at Yorktown, at
the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, in Virginia. They were waiting for
reinforcements and supplies.


While Cornwallis was setting up camp at Yorktown, Washington
was meeting with several French generals outside New York City.
The French had sent thousands of troops to assist Washington. Now
Washington and the French generals had to decide how to best utilize
these new troops. Should they attack the British in New York City, or
should they head south and attack Cornwallis in Virginia?


Eventually they decided to march the main Continental Army and
most of the French troops south to Virginia and try to trap Cornwallis.
But Washington was crafty. He sent out fake messages to make the
British think he was actually going to attack New York. The British were
fooled by the messages.


- Have a student read the heading on page 50.


**Inferential.** What does the heading suggest will happen next?


» The war will end soon.


- Have students read pages 50 and 51 silently.


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


In late September, Washington arrived at Yorktown with 4,000
French soldiers and 3,000 Continental soldiers. The Major General of
the Continental Army was the Marquis de Lafayette. These new soldiers
**reinforced** Lafayette’s men who were already there. The French navy
arrived as well, and one of the first things they did was drive away a
**convoy** of British ships that were carrying supplies for Cornwallis and
his men. That was when Cornwallis knew he was in trouble. He was
cornered by the French and Continental armies, and the French navy
had cut off his escape route as well as his supplies!


The French and Continental armies set up cannons and began
firing on the British. For days the guns fired constantly. Washington
gave orders to fire through the night so the British would not have any
quiet time to rest or make repairs.


Cornwallis and his men could not protect themselves and,
because of the position of the French **fleet**, they could not sail away.
Eventually, on October 19, 1781, Cornwallis accepted that he had no
choice but to surrender.


**Inferential.** Why was it important for Washington to trick the British into thinking he
planned to attack New York?


» If the British army knew Washington’s plan, they could potentially stop his troops

on their march south. Washington wanted to make a surprise attack on Cornwallis

at Yorktown so Cornwallis would not be prepared.


**Inferential.** In what way was the French fleet important to Washington’s plan?


» The French fleet enabled the Continental Army to corner Cornwallis on all sides,

both land and water. Cornwallis and his men could not sail away because of the

position of the French fleet.

**Establish Small Groups**

- Before reading the chapter, divide students into two groups using the
following guidelines:


  - Small Group 1: This group should include students who need extra
scaffolding and support to read and comprehend the text. Use the guided
reading supports to guide students through reading the text. This is an
excellent time to make notes in your anecdotal records. Students will
complete Activity Page 11.1 with your support while reading.

  - Small Group 2: This group should include students who are capable of
reading and comprehending text without guided support. We encourage
you to vary how you assign students to read either independently or with
partners, based on their needs. Likewise, you may want to ask some or all
of your students to complete Activity Page 11.1 independently, which can
then be used as a formative assessment to determine how well each student
understood what was read. Make arrangements to check that students in
Small Group 2 have answered the questions on Activity Page 11.1 correctly.

Von Steuben taught the Continental
soldiers how to march and stand in
formation. He taught them how
to advance on the battlefield. He
also taught them how to use the
**bayonets** attached to their muskets.
Von Steuben trained a **model**
**company** . Then, the members
of this model company trained
other companies.


Things began to improve in
the spring of 1778. Washington sent
out **foraging** parties to gather cattle, horses, **Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben**
corn, hay, and grains from the local people.
They returned with enough food to feed the soldiers at Valley Forge.
Washington also appointed a new quartermaster whose job was to make
sure the army did not run out of food or supplies. And, last but not least,

Washington convinced the Continental Congress to

send more money and to **recruit** more soldiers.



**Lord Cornwallis**



By the time the Continental Army
marched out of Valley Forge in June
1778, they were much better prepared
to fight as an army. The newly trained
Continental Army began to win more
battles. Their first **decisive** victory came
in the fall of 1781. At this point, much of
the fighting had shifted south to Virginia
and the Carolinas. British troops in the south
were led by Lord Cornwallis.

Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


**The Beginning of the End**

In August 1781, Cornwallis and his men camped at Yorktown, at
the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, in Virginia. They were waiting for
reinforcements and supplies.


While Cornwallis was setting up camp at Yorktown, Washington
was meeting with several French generals outside New York City.
The French had sent thousands of troops to assist Washington. Now
Washington and the French generals had to decide how to best utilize
these new troops. Should they attack the British in New York City, or
should they head south and attack Cornwallis in Virginia?


Eventually they decided to march the main Continental Army and
most of the French troops south to Virginia and try to trap Cornwallis.
But Washington was crafty. He sent out fake messages to make the
British think he was actually going to attack New York. The British were
fooled by the messages.


**Literal.** In August 1781, where was Lord Cornwallis camped with the British troops?

Lesson 11 Five Years and 700 Miles



**223**


**224**



In late September, Washington arrived at Yorktown with 4,000
French soldiers and 3,000 Continental soldiers. The Major General of
the Continental Army was the Marquis de Lafayette. These new soldiers
**reinforced** Lafayette’s men who were already there. The French navy
arrived as well, and one of the first things they did was drive away a
**convoy** of British ships that were carrying supplies for Cornwallis and
his men. That was when Cornwallis knew he was in trouble. He was
cornered by the French and Continental armies, and the French navy
had cut off his escape route as well as his supplies!


The French and Continental armies set up cannons and began
firing on the British. For days the guns fired constantly. Washington
gave orders to fire through the night so the British would not have any
quiet time to rest or make repairs.


Cornwallis and his men could not protect themselves and,
because of the position of the French **fleet**, they could not sail away.
Eventually, on October 19, 1781, Cornwallis accepted that he had no
choice but to surrender.


**Inferential.** How quickly did the colonial troops march to Virginia? Support your
answer with evidence from the text.


» Less than two months. They left New York in August and arrived in Virginia in late

September, so while the text doesn’t provide precise dates, we can infer that it

was less than two months.

After General O’Hara surrendered, the British troops were
directed to ground their arms. More than 7,000 British soldiers laid
down their guns. Of course, as James Thatcher recorded, many of
them were not happy about it:

**Primary Focus:** Students will demonstrate understanding of subject- _to be_ verb

agreement in the present tense. ~~**[ TEKS 4.11.D.i ]**~~


**Introduce Subject-to be Verb Agreement**

 - Remind students that in the previous lessons, they learned about subjectaction verb agreement. Review that an action verb describes a subject’s action.
Write the following sentence on the board:


    - The British general surrenders at Yorktown.


 - Have students identify the action verb (surrenders).


 - Have students provide a list of action verbs and record their answers on the
board/chart paper.


 - Tell students that today they will learn about a different kind of verb. This type
of verb does not show action.


 - Refer to the Subject- _to be_ Verb Agreement Poster you prepared in advance.


 - Read the definition of _to be_ verbs.


    - _To be_ verbs are linking verbs that link, or connect, the subject to the
predicate without showing action. Explain that the examples given in the
poster are in the present tense.


**Note:** The copula be–the _to be_ verb–and the third-person singular inflection

pose problems for English learners at all levels. Thus, detailed treatment is

given to the present tense forms of the _to be_ verb.


 - Point out the following:


   - If the subject is _I_, the correct form of the _to be_ verb is _am_ .

   - If the subject is _he_, _she_, _it_, or a singular noun, the correct form of the _to be_
verb is _is_ .

   - If the subject is _you_, _we_, _they_, or a plural noun, the correct form of the _to be_
verb is _are_ .


**TEKS 4.11.D.i** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including complete simple and compound sentences with
subject-verb agreement and avoidance of splices, run-ons, and fragments.


Lesson 11 Five Years and 700 Miles



**229**


Activity Page 11.2



**Note:** Action verbs describe an action or what the subject is doing (e.g., run,

walk, paint, write, study). Stative/non-action verbs represent a state of being

(e.g., to be, like, love, seem, think, believe).


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 11.2. Divide students into pairs or small

groups to complete the chart in the first part of the activity page. Review the
completed chart as a class. Review the directions and completed examples
in the next two sections of the activity page. Tell students to complete the
remainder of the activity page for homework.


~~**MORPHOLOGY (15 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students will understand how the suffixes – _able_ and – _ible_ modify

root words, form new words, and use those words in sentences. ~~**TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.3.C**~~


**Introduce Suffixes –able and –ible**

 - Refer to the Suffixes Poster on display in the classroom and read the definition
of a suffix to students.


 - Tell students that the two suffixes they will study this week are _–able_ and _–ible_ .
Explain that the Latin suffixes _–able_ and _–ible_ both mean “able to.”


 - Write the suffix _–able_ on the board/chart paper and explain that it is
pronounced /ә*bәl/. Write the suffix _–ible_ on the board/chart paper and
explain that it is also pronounced /ә*bәl/.


 - Tell students that when _–able_ and _–ible_ are added to nouns or verbs, the word
becomes an adjective.


 - Write _enjoy_ on the board. Briefly discuss the meaning of the word and then use
it in a sentence. ( _Enjoy_ means to take pleasure in doing or experiencing. I enjoy
being outside when it is sunny.)


 - Add the suffix _–able_ to _enjoy_ and have students read the new word. Discuss
the meaning of the new word. ( _Enjoyable_ means able to take pleasure in; able
to enjoy.) You may want to point out that the suffix _–able_ changes the part of
speech from a verb (enjoy) to an adjective (enjoyable).


 - Share the following example of _enjoyable_ used in a sentence.


    - Grocery shopping is more enjoyable when the store is not crowded.


 - Have students provide sentences using the word _enjoyable_ .


» Answers may vary.


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.3.C** Determine the meaning of and use words with
affixes such as mis-, sub-, -ment, and -ity/ty and roots such as auto, graph, and meter.

**230**


 - Ask students for synonyms of _enjoyable_ .


» pleasant, delightful, fun


 - Write _collect_ on the board. Briefly discuss the meaning of the word and then
use it in a sentence. ( _Collect_ means to gather. The children collect leaves from
the ground in the fall.)


 - Add _–ible_ to _collect_ and have students read the new word; discuss the meaning
of the new word. ( _Collectible_ means worthy of being collected.) Point out that
the suffix _–ible_ changes the part of speech from a verb (collect) to an adjective
(collectible).


 - You may also want to explain that _collectible_ can sometimes be spelled
_collectable_ . (able to be collected)


 - Share the following example of _collectible_ used in a sentence:


    - Baseball cards are collectible because they can be very valuable.


 - Have students provide sentences using the word _collectible_ .


» Answers may vary.


 - Ask students for synonyms of _collectible_ .

 - Introduce the words by writing them on the board/chart paper. First say the
word aloud, and then sound out each syllable, naming each letter as you write
it. Continue syllable by syllable. Remember to model isolating the vowel sound
in each syllable to help students decode the words. It may be helpful to draw
students’ attention to the syllable types within each word. You may wish to use
the pronunciation chart to guide students in saying the words.

 - It may be helpful to point out spelling patterns within each word and show

students these spellings on the Individual Code Chart. For example, you might
note that _greasy_ includes an /ee/ sound in the first syllable of the word (i.e.,
the first syllable is pronounced /ee/ but spelled ‘ea’) and then point out the ‘ea’
spelling for /ee/ that is included on the Individual Code Chart.

Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


**Helping Hands**

There were also many heroes from other countries
who came to support the colonists and help them gain
independence from Britain. Kościuszko, from Poland,
helped the Continental Army win the Battle of Saratoga.
Von Steuben, the German, helped Washington transform
untrained farmers into a disciplined, well-regulated army. **Tadeusz Kościuszko**
The Marquis de Lafayette was the young Frenchman who was a major in
the Continental Army and helped Washington win the Battle of Yorktown.


Another hero was the Scottish sea captain John Paul Jones. Jones

went to live in the colonies, and when war broke out he decided

to fight on the side of his adopted homeland. In 1779, his ship,



**John Paul Jones**



_Bonhomme Richard_, became involved in a sea battle with the
British ship _Serapis_ . The _Bonhomme Richard_ had 42 guns. The
_Serapis_ had 50 guns. For a while, the two ships floated right
next to each other, blasting away. At one point, a British sailor
shouted to Jones, asking him if he was ready to surrender.



“Surrender?” Jones shouted back. “I have not yet begun to fight!”
In the end, it was the British captain who had to surrender. The story
of the victory—along with Jones’s **defiant** reply—was printed in
newspapers and John Paul Jones became a hero.



Nathan Hale, a schoolteacher from Connecticut,
demonstrated his heroism in a different way. In 1776, he
volunteered to help General Washington with a very
dangerous mission. He agreed to sneak behind British
lines in New York City and spy on the British army there.
Unfortunately, Hale was captured and the British gave
orders that he be hanged. However, before he died, according
to legend, Hale uttered, “I only regret that I have but one life to
lose for my country.”

hand cupped as though shouting to the boat in the distance; the image helps the

reader visualize the scene.


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


**Unsung Heroes**

Saul Matthews, an African **enlisted** in the Continental Army,
served as a soldier in Virginia. His name may be less recognizable
today than some of the others, but he became a hero in his own right.
Matthews was a successful spy and provided key information about
British troop positions. Colonel Josiah Parker commissioned Matthews
to go on spying missions in British military camps.


Another unsung colonial hero,

to become a servant to Lord
Cornwallis to spy on him. At
some point, Lord Cornwallis
asked Armistead to become
a spy. Armistead agreed,
but what Cornwallis didn’t
know was that Armistead
was secretly working for
the colonial side. He passed
along important information
to the Continental Army and
gave unimportant information
to Lord Cornwallis.


Peter Salem, a freed enslaved

**James Armistead**

person, was one of the militiamen who
fought in the Battles of Concord and
Lexington. He also fought in the Battle of Bunker Hill. Salem went on
to join the Fifth Massachusetts **Regiment** and served in the Continental
Army for seven years. Few soldiers served for that length of time. He
was considered to be a war hero. As a result, in 1882, a monument was
erected in Framingham, Massachusetts, in his honor.

- Read the heading and first paragraph on page 60 aloud.

- Read the remainder of page 60 aloud.


**Inferential.** What do the three men introduced on this page have in common?


» All three helped the Continental Army win the war.

Support


An unsung hero is
someone who may be
less well-known for their
heroism, and whose name
is less familiar than other
heroes who receive a
great deal of attention
and notoriety.


**245**


There were also many **heroines** during this time in American
history. George Washington’s wife, Martha, played an important role
in helping the Continental Army survive at Valley
Forge. She helped make clothing for the
soldiers and helped take care of the sick.



Abigail Adams, the wife of John
Adams, raised their children and
managed their farm, but she also
housed and fed Continental soldiers.
Mrs. Adams was known to write
letters to her husband, one of the most
important delegates in the Continental
Congress. In these letters, Mrs. Adams
advocated for women’s rights, especially with
regard to educational opportunities. She also let
him know that she was opposed to slavery.



**Abigail Adams**



At the time, most people believed that fighting in the army was
strictly a job for men. Some women were allowed to serve in the army,
performing duties such as nursing, cooking, searching for food, and
even burying the dead. But women who tried to enlist were turned
away. Some women, however, disguised themselves as men so they, too,
could fight for their country.


Deborah Sampson, from Massachusetts, signed up for the army
using the name Robert Shurtlief. Sampson served for a year and a half
and fought in several **skirmishes** . In one of them, she was wounded.
Two musket balls lodged in her thigh. Sampson removed one of
the balls herself, but the other was buried too deep to be removed.
Fortunately, her wound healed and she survived. After the war,
Deborah Sampson was recognized by John Hancock for having shown
“an extraordinary instance of female heroism.”

Support - Read page 61 aloud.



A heroine is a woman who
is respected for bravery or

good qualities.


**246**



**Inferential.** How does the text on this page suggest what the meaning of the word
_heroine_ is?


» The text describes great or brave actions by women during the American Revolution.


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


Another woman, Mary Draper, also fed and clothed Continental
soldiers as they marched through her hometown. But she even went
so far as to melt down the pewter dishes she owned so that the metal
could be used to make bullets.


Still other women became heroes by simply standing up for what
they believed. Historians have recorded the story of Mum Bett, an
enslaved woman from Massachusetts. It seems Mum Bett may have
heard her patriot master reading the Massachusetts State Constitution
aloud. Bett thought about the words in that document, “All men are

opposed to slavery and
convinced him to take
her case. To the surprise
of many, she won the
lawsuit. In 1781, the
Supreme Court of
Massachusetts ruled
that Mum Bett could
no longer be held as
an enslaved person.

~~**INTRODUCE CHAPTER 8 (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students they will read Chapter 8, “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” (adapted
from the story by Washington Irving).







Explain that Washington Irving was an American author who lived and wrote

during the years following the American Revolution. He wrote many wellknown short stories set during this time period and is considered one of the
first authors of American literature. “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” was first
published in 1820, nearly 40 years after the American Revolution, as part of a
collection of stories.



**256**




 - Point out that this story was adapted from one of Irving’s short stories. Explain

that, when a story is adapted, it is changed in some way to make it more
suitable for a particular audience. In this case, some of the language has been
simplified for modern-day students.


 - Explain to students that this is a work of fiction and is not meant to be real in

any way.

central idea and genre characteristics and craft.


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


 - Review the following elements of a strong concluding paragraph as you write/
display them in front of the students:


   - An opening sentence that summarizes the central idea of the essay


   - Sentences that summarize the body paragraphs


   - An ending sentence that makes a significant statement and wraps up

the essay


 - Restate to students that the goal with the conclusion is to reinforce the ideas
already presented in the essay, not to rehash or add new arguments. The
conclusion should be concise.


~~**DRAFTING A CONCLUDING PARAGRAPH (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students you will first model how to write a concluding paragraph.


 - Write your sentences on the board/chart paper as you model and continue to
refer back to the elements of a strong conclusion as a cue for the students.


 - Remind students the central idea of the cause-and-effect essay is contained
in the introductory paragraph. Ask the class to tell you the central idea of
the essay.


 - Revise the central idea with the class until satisfied and write it on the board/
chart paper. Examples include:


    - The American Revolution resulted from multiple disagreements between
Great Britain and the colonists that lasted over the course of many years.


   - The American Revolution was caused by many things.


 - Remind students that their body paragraphs address the multiple causes and
effects leading to the American Revolution.


 - Follow the opening sentence with few sentences that summarize the body
paragraphs. For example:


    - Great Britain owed a lot of money following the French and Indian War and
taxed the colonists to help pay their debts. The British government passed
the Stamp Act, forcing the colonists to pay a tax when they purchased
paper products. Angered by this new tax, the colonists protested, and
Great Britain repealed the Stamp Act.


 - Finally, effective concluding paragraphs often end with a sentence that makes

a significant statement and wraps up the essay. For example:


    - But the colonists were not satisfied and decided to declare independence

from Great Britain—even if it meant going to war.

remainder of this unit. Alternatively, you may access a digital version provided
in the online materials for this unit.


**Irregular Past-Tense Verbs, Adverbs that Convey Frequency and**
**Degree, and Prepositions**


**Irregular Past-Tense Verbs**


      - Regular verbs use past-tense forms that follow an established pattern.

Add _–ed:_ “We parked the car.”


      - Irregular verbs use past-tense forms that are completely different from
their present-tense forms.


Examples: go/went/gone


      - Irregular past-tense verbs must be memorized.


**Adverbs**


      - Adverbs that convey frequency tell how often something happens.


For example, the adverb _always_ tells how often the homework is
done on time: _I always do my homework on time._


      - Adverbs that convey degree tell how much or to what degree.


For example, the adverb _completely_ is a word that shows to what
degree something is done: _Rachel cleared the table completely._


**Prepositions and Prepositional Phrases**


      - Prepositions indicate where or when something exists.


For example, the word _under_ in the statement _The dog crawled under_
_the bed_ lets a reader know the where the dog is in relation to the bed.


      - Prepositional phrases begin with the preposition and include its object
and any words used to modify the object. Prepositional phrases can be
used to modify a verb, like _climbed_ in _We climbed up the hill,_ or to modify a
noun, like _homework_ in _The homework in my backpack is due tomorrow._

- Tell students they will read independently to gain a deeper understanding of the
classic short story, “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” and identify literary devices,
such as simile, metaphor, and hyperbole.


~~**RE-READING “THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW” (20 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** At this point in the school year, some or all of your students are likely

ready for the challenge of reading the entire chapter independently to

themselves, especially since this lesson is a reread of the chapter read as a

whole group yesterday.


- Pair students to read and discuss the chapter. Alternatively, some or all
students may read independently.


- Have students complete Activity Page 14.1 with their partners while they
read. Likewise, you may want to ask some or all students to complete Activity
Page 14.1 independently, which can then be used as a formative assessment to
determine how well each student understood what was read.


Check for Understanding


Circulate to make sure students understand Activity Page 14.1 and can
read all of the words in the questions. Provide clarification and support
when needed.


~~**DISCUSS CHAPTER AND COMPARE PROSE TO DRAMA (20 MIN.)**~~


- Review the correct answers to Activity Page 14.1 with the whole group. You
may wish to select different students to read each question and share their
responses, including the page number where the answer was located.


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


1. A simile is a literary device that uses the word like or as to compare two things.
This simile helps describe the setting:


A drowsy, dreamy atmosphere hangs over the valley, as if it were under the
sway of some bewitching power.


**Literal.** What two things are compared in this simile?


» the atmosphere of the valley and the sway of some bewitching power


**Inferential.** What mood does this simile convey about the setting?


» Answers may vary, but should include words similar to spellbinding, haunting,

magical, or enchanting. (page 64)


2. **Literal.** A hyperbole is a literary device that uses exaggeration. Underline

the hyperbole used to describe the main character, Ichabod Crane, in the

following text:


In this out-of-the-way place there lived a teacher by the name of Ichabod

Crane. His name was well-suited to him. He was tall and very lanky, with

narrow shoulders, long arms and legs, and hands that dangled a mile out

of his sleeves.


**Inferential.** Explain the hyperbole in your own words.


» Answers may vary, but should include the fact that a man’s hands would never

hang a mile below his shirtsleeves. This hyperbole means Ichabod has very long

hands. (page 64)


3. **Literal.** Underline the two similes used to describe Ichabod Crane in

this sentence:


His elbows stuck out like a grasshopper’s, and as he rode, his arms flapped
like a pair of wings.


**Literal.** What two things are compared in each simile?


» Ichabod’s elbows are compared to a grasshopper’s; Ichabod’s arms when he rides

are compared to a pair of wings.


**Evaluative.** How do these similes help describe what Ichabod Crane looks like?


» Answers may vary, but should include that comparing Ichabod’s elbows and arms

to a grasshopper’s hind legs and wings helps the reader visualize how Ichabod

looks riding the horse. (page 67)


4. Personification is a literary device in which human characteristics are assigned

to nonhuman objects. Personification is used in this statement:


What fearful shapes and shadows jumped across his path! How often did

he dread to look over his shoulder, for fear of catching a glimpse of some
ghostly being close behind him!


Lesson 14 Literary Devices in “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow”



Support


If students struggle to
identify the hyperbole, give
an example of how long a
mile is, such as “The river
is one mile away from our
classroom.” Then ask them
to reread the passage and
look for a detail that may
be exaggerated.


Challenge


Ask students to revise
this description of Crane
into one that includes a
metaphor instead of a
simile.


**279**


**280**



**Literal.** What nonhuman object(s) are assigned human characteristics?


» shapes and shadows


**Evaluative.** Explain the personification in your own words.


» Answers may vary, but should explain that the path seems more frightening

because the shapes and shadows are described as having human characteristics

(jumping) (page 66).


5. **Evaluative.** Authors often use fear or suspense to build excitement. Do you
think this story was scary or suspenseful? Why or why not? Support your
answer with examples from the story.

» Answers may vary, but may include yes, because of the mystical setting of the

story, Ichabod’s interest in the supernatural, ghostly sounds, Ichabod’s travels

after dusk in a dark wood, tales of a headless horseman, the encounter with this

mysterious rider, and Ichabod’s unexplained disappearance. Students may also

mention the mood suggested by the illustrations and words used in the text

( _bewitching, formidable, dread, fear, horror-struck, terror, etc._ ). Students may say

no, because there isn’t much action in the story.


6. **Inferential.** A theme is a recurring idea or subject in a story. One theme in
“The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” is greed. A second theme is real vs. imaginary.
Select one theme and provide examples from the text, showing how the author
weaves this theme into the story.

» Answers may vary, but may include Ichabod’s desire to marry Katrina Van Tassel

to gain wealth (greed); or ghosts, a headless horseman, imaginative thoughts in

the darkness (real vs. imaginary).


**Prose and Drama**

- Direct students to Activity Page 1.1, Scene III (pages 5-6 in the Activity Book).
Have students read the scene aloud.


- Remind students that they have read several of these vignettes over the
course of the unit and ask them how the vignettes differ from chapters in
the Reader.


» Answers will vary but may include that in the vignettes the characters are listed on

top and most of the text consists of dialogue.


- Explain to students that the vignettes in the Activity Book are written as
dramas, which are different from poems like “Paul Revere’s Ride” and from
stories like “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” which is written in prose. Discuss the
differences, including the character list, the dialogue on the page and the fact
that the vignette is called “Scene III.”


- Explain that dramas are stories acted out, and spoken out loud, in front of people.


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


- Have a student read British General’s last line on page 5 of the Activity book. If the
student did not read the word in brackets, ask the class why they did not. If the
student cleared their throat before reading the line, ask the class why.


- Tell students that the words in brackets are called “stage directions.” Ask them
why they think the words are called that.


» Because dramas are often performed on stage and the stage directions give the

actors direction on how to speak or act.


- Ask students for examples of books that have been made into movies. Then
lead them in a discussion of how the same story can be told in more than one
way, for example in prose and as a drama.


- Direct students to the first two sentences on page 66 of the reader: “He loved
to pass long winter evenings with the farmers’ wives as they sat spinning by the
fire. He listened with interest to their tales of ghosts and goblins—and of the
headless horseman.”


- As homework, have them write the scene described in those two sentences as
a short drama. Remind them that dramas are stories told by actors playing the
characters and speaking dialogue out loud in front of an audience.


- Once students have completed the homework assignment, give them a chance
to perform their dramas in front of the class, using their classmates as additional
actors. Have audience members describe the differences between the prose
description (the two sentences from the Reader) and the dramatic performances.


- Have the student playwrights tell the class what structural elements of drama
they included in their scenes (e.g., stage directions, character list, dialogue).


~~**WORD WORK: FORMIDABLE (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the chapter you read, “The most formidable of all [suitors] was a local hero
known as Brom Bones.”


2. Say the word _formidable_ with me.


3. _Formidable_ means extremely powerful, worthy of respect.


4. The British army was a very formidable foe for the Continental Army.


5. What are some other examples of things or people who could be described as
formidable? Be sure to use the word formidable in your response.

- Ask two or three students to use the target word in a sentence. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to make complete sentences:
“ is formidable because ”


Lesson 14 Literary Devices in “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow”



**281**


**282**



6. What part of speech is the word formidable?

» adjective


- Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.


- Say, “I am going to read several sentences. If the sentence I read describes
something that is/was formidable, say, ‘That is/was a formidable .’ If the
sentence I read does not describe something that is/was formidable, say ‘That
is/was not a formidable .’”


1. The hurricane damaged a lot of the trees in our yard. Would you say that was or
was not a formidable storm?

» That was a formidable storm.


2. The last soccer team we played was the only team we couldn’t beat. Would you

say that the soccer team was or was not a formidable opponent?

» That was a formidable opponent.


3. Our dog rolls over to have his tummy rubbed when someone comes in the

room. Would you say our dog is or is not a formidable guard dog?

» That is not a formidable guard dog.


4. The British army had more experience and more weapons than the Continental
Army. Would you say that the British Army was or was not a formidable
enemy?

» That was a formidable enemy.


**Note:** In French, _formidable_ means “great or terrific” in a positive sense,

which sounds close but is not exactly the same as the English meaning.

**Primary Focus:** Students understand how to form the past tense of irregular verbs, use

adverbs that convey frequency and degree, and use prepositions. Language
Using Verbs

~~**TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.11.D.ii; TEKS 4.11.D.v; TEKS 4.11.D.vi**~~



**Introduce Irregular Past-Tense Verbs, Adverbs that Convey**
**Frequency and Time, and Prepositions**

- Refer to the Irregular Past-Tense Verbs, Adverbs that Convey Frequency and
Degree, and Prepositions Poster you prepared in advance.


**Irregular Past-Tense Verbs**

- As a class, read the information about irregular past-tense verbs.


- Ask students what a verb is. _(A word that shows action.)_


- Explain to students that a regular verb forms different tenses (present, past,
and future) according to an established pattern (adding _–s, –ed,_ or _–ing_ ). For
example, the verb _walk_ is a regular verb (e.g., _I walk to school every day. I walked_
_to school everyday. I will be walking to school every day._ ).


- Explain to students that an irregular verb does not follow the normal rules of
conjugation and that the structure of the word completely changes in the past
tense. For example, the verb _run_ is an irregular verb. The past tense of _run_ is _ran_
(e.g. _I ran to school yesterday._ ). Another example of an irregular verb is _eat._ The
past tense of _eat_ is _ate_ (e.g. _I ate an apple yesterday._ ).


- Write the following verbs on the board: _play, meet_


- Ask students to study each word and decide whether it is a regular verb or
irregular verb.


- Ask students what is the past-tense form of the verb _play. (played)_


- Ask students what is the past-tense form of the verb _meet. (met)_


- Point out to students that the verb _play_ is a regular verb because it follows the
same pattern (adding _–ed_ ) when changing from present to past tense and that
the verb _meet_ is an irregular verb because it does not follow specific patterns or
rules when changing from present to past tense.


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.11.D** Edit drafts using standard English conventions,
including (ii) past tense of irregular verbs; (v) adverbs that convey frequency and adverbs that convey degree; (vi)
prepositions and prepositional phrases.


Lesson 14 Literary Devices in “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow”



Beginning
Provide 1:1 support using
irregular past-tense
verbs first through model
sentences created by the
teacher which can compare
easily to those being used
on Activity Page 14.2.


Intermediate
Ask partners to work
together on Activity Page
14.2, and then make
one additional original
sentence using the same
irregular past-tense verb
featured in each question.


Advanced/Advanced High
Have students individually
write one additional
original sentence using
the same irregular pasttense verb featured in
each question. Then,
have students read
their sentence aloud to
a partner.

~~**ELPS 3.C**~~


**283**


**284**




- Have students turn to Activity Page 14.2 and complete Part I. Students are
expected to write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.


- Have a few students share their corrections to the paragraph with the class.


**Adverbs that Convey Frequency and Degree**

- Ask students what an adverb is. _(A word that can describe a verb.)_


- Explain to students that adverbs that convey degree are words that tell about
the intensity of something. Adverbs that convey degree answer how much or to
what degree.


- Explain to students that adverbs that convey frequency are words that indicate
how often something happens.


- Write the following sentences on the board. Read each sentence aloud to students.

   - The students were almost finished with their classwork.

   - I always brush my teeth before I go to bed.

- Ask students what the verb is in the first sentence. _(finished)_


- Ask students to what extent are the students finished. _(almost)_ Explain to
students that the word _almost_ is an adverb that conveys degree. The word
_almost_ shows to what degree something is done.


- Ask students what the verb is in the second sentence. _(brush)_


- Ask students how often does the person brush their teeth. _(always)_ Explain to
students that the word _always_ is an adverb that conveys frequency. The word
_always_ shows how often something is done.


- Direct students back to Activity Page 14.2. Have them complete Part II.


- Have students share their sentences with the class.


**Prepositions and Prepositional Phrases**

- Explain to students that a preposition is a word that can answer how, when,
what, or where questions about something in a sentence. For example the word
_under_ in the statement _The ants crawled under the picnic basket_ lets the reader
know where the ants are in relation to the picnic basket.


- Explain to students that a prepositional phrase is a phrase that begins with
a preposition and is followed by an object (e.g., _We climbed up the hill_ ). A
prepositional phrase answers the same questions, how, when, what, where that
a preposition answers about something in a sentence.


- Write the following sentence on the board. Read the sentence aloud to students.

   - The cat walked slowly above the box.

- Ask students where the cat is walking. _(above the box)_


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


- Ask students what is the preposition _(above)._ How do you know? ( _The word_
above _tells where the cat is in relation to the box._ )


- Ask students what is the prepositional phrase in the sentence. _(above the box)_
How do you know? _(The phrase begins with the preposition above and tells_
_where the cat is.)_ Activity Page 14.2


- Direct students back to Activity Page 14.2 and have them complete Part III.


- Have several students their responses with the class.


- Have students complete Activity Page 14.2 for homework if needed.


Check for Understanding


Ask students: Does this make sense to you? Please show me how well
you understand. Place your fist discreetly on your chest and put your
thumb up, thumb out, or thumb down. Explain information a different
way for students who did not understand (thumb down) or were unsure
(thumb out).


~~**MORPHOLOGY (10 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students understand how the suffixes – _able_ and – _ible_ modify root

words, will form new words and use those words in sentences. ~~**TEKS 4.3.C**~~


**Practice Suffixes –able and –ible**

- Refer to the Suffixes Poster on display in the classroom. Review what a
suffix is and review the suffixes  - _able_ and – _ible_ you added to the poster in
Lesson 11. Remind students that when – _able_ or – _ible_ are added to verbs or
nouns, the new word is an adjective.


- Refer to the word list on the board/chart paper. Have a student read
the words aloud: _visible, accessible, collectible, portable, comfortable,_
_predictable, enjoyable._


- Model aloud how to think about the meaning of the word _predictable_ : “You can
predict something that you know about in advance. So _predictable_ describes
something that is able to be known in advance, or predicted.”


- Tell students you will read some sentences aloud, but will leave a word out.
Students must listen carefully and decide which word from the list best
completes the sentence.


**TEKS 4.3.C** Determine the meaning of and use words with affixes such as mis-, sub-, -ment, and -ity/ty and roots such as
auto, graph, and meter.

- Read the following sentences aloud and have students identify the missing
word for each:


   - The chair was really soft with big arms and a matching footrest, so it was
the most seat in the room ( _comfortable_ ).


   - My teacher has a computer that he can take home with him
( _portable_ ).


   - We had a very day visiting the science museum and the new exhibit
on sharks ( _enjoyable_ ).


- Have students turn to Activity Page 14.3. Briefly review the directions, complete
the first sentence as a group, and then have students complete the remainder
independently.


- Collect Activity Page 14.3 to review and grade at a later time.


~~**SPELLING (15 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students spell targeted words with an increased rate of accuracy.


~~**TEKS 4.2.B.i; TEKS 4.2.B.iii; TEKS 4.2.B.iv; TEKS 4.2.B.v**~~


**Practice Spelling Words**

- Tell students they will practice writing the spelling words.


- Have students turn to Activity Page 14.4, explaining that the spelling words are
listed in the box on the activity page.


- Have students read sentence 1 silently and fill in the blank. After students
complete it, call on one student to read the sentence aloud with the spelling
word in the blank.


- Ask students if anyone had a different answer. Discuss the correct answer to
ensure students understand why it is correct.


- Have students check their spelling with the spelling in the word bank at the top
of the activity page, make corrections if needed, and then turn their page over.


- Have students say, spell, and say the word again with you without looking at
their paper. Students may close their eyes, look up at the ceiling, or trace on the
back of their paper with their finger to help them visualize the spelling as they
spell with you.


**TEKS 4.2.B** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling multisyllabic words with closed syllables, open

 - Students might make the following errors:


   - greasy: using ‘ee’ instead of ‘ea’ for /ee/; using ‘ee’ instead of ‘y’ for /ee/

   - noisy: using ‘z’ instead of ‘s’ for /z/

   - tasty: using ‘ee’ instead of ‘y’ for /ee/

   - easily: using ‘z’ instead of ‘s’ for /s/; using ‘u’ instead of ‘i’ for /ә/; using ‘ee’

 - Although any of the above student-error scenarios may occur, misspellings

may be due to many other factors. You may find it helpful to use the analysis
chart to record any student errors. For example:


   - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?

   - Is the student consistently making errors at the ends of the words?

   - Is the student consistently making errors in multisyllable words, but not
single-syllable words?


 - Also, examine the dictated sentence for errors in capitalization and
punctuation.

###### Writing 30m


**Primary Focus:** Students will engage in collaborative discussions with peers,

providing and receiving constructive criticism in regard to cause-and-effect essays,

and will use feedback to strengthen and develop writing by planning, revising, and

editing. ~~**TEKS 4.1.A; TEKS 4.1.C; TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.11.C**~~


~~**REVIEW CAUSE-AND-EFFECT ESSAYS (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Return the essays you collected during the previous lesson, ensuring that each
student has their cause-and-effect essay draft.







Point out that now students have a complete draft of their cause-and-effect

essay. Tell students today they will be working in the share and evaluate stages
of the writing process to receive feedback and reflect on their essay. Receiving
feedback and reflecting on writing helps writers refine what they have written
to make it clearer and more enjoyable for readers to read.



**294**




 - Discuss expectations for speaking, listening, and responding. Remember that
active listening includes asking questions that restate what is heard and
clarify for additional information. Tell students receiving feedback that they
should wait until they have received the feedback and then ask at least one
follow-up question.


**TEKS 4.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and make pertinent comments; **TEKS 4.1.C**
Express an opinion supported by accurate information, employing eye contact, speaking rate, volume, and enunciation,
and the conventions of language to communicate ideas effectively; **TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete
assignments; **TEKS 4.11.C** Revise drafts to improve sentence structure and word choice by adding, deleting, combining,
and rearranging ideas for coherence and clarity.

finish sharing in their small writing group.


~~**SHARE AND RECEIVE FEEDBACK (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students move into their small writing groups with their drafts and pencils.


 - Tell students that, after each student reads their cause-and-effect essay, other
students in the group should each share one compliment and one question.


 - Have groups decide who will share first and begin.


Check for Understanding


Observe students to make sure they are providing appropriate feedback
and that groups are staying on task. Model how to make suggestions and
how to respond to feedback when needed.


 - As groups finish, students may return to their seats to complete
Activity Page 15.4. Students are expected to write legibly in cursive to complete
assignments.


 - If students complete Activity Page 15.4, they may begin revising their essays
with the time remaining.


~~**WRAP-UP (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Have a few students share the revision goals they set for their cause-and­

~~**READ “RIP VAN WINKLE” (25 MIN.)**~~


- Read the first two paragraphs on page 72 aloud.


**Literal.** What kind of person is Rip Van Winkle? Find words in the text to
describe him.


» He is a simple, good-natured fellow; a kind neighbor; a lovable soul who is ready

to attend to anybody’s business but his own; one of those happy fools who lives

without a care.


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


**Literal.** How does Rip’s wife respond to him? Support your answer with evidence
from the text.


» She complains about him. (“His wife was continually complaining about his

laziness and the ruin he was bringing upon his family.”) When he shrugs and

doesn’t reply to her complaints, it provokes “a fresh attack from his wife.” In other

words, his inactivity causes his wife to yell at him. By helping his neighbors but not

his own family, Rip’s wife feels Rip is “bringing ruin” on his family; in other words,

he is not working to take care of his family. (Point out the last sentence of the first

paragraph: As to keeping his own farm in order, he found it impossible, and his

children were as ragged as if they belonged to nobody.)


 - Read the final paragraph on page 72 aloud, continuing to the end of the
paragraph at the top of page 74.


Lesson 15 Rip Van Winkle

**Rip used to console himself, when driven from home, with the company of a group of**
**other men who met on a bench in front of an inn.**


**73**


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


One day, seeking to escape the hard work of the farm and the
complaints of his wife, Rip grabbed his gun and walked into the Catskill
Mountains to hunt for squirrels. All day the mountains echoed with the
sound of shots fired from his gun. Finally, he sat down on a little green
hill that looked down into the valley below. Rip admired the scene as
evening gradually advanced and sighed as he thought about the
journey home.


As he was about to descend, he heard a voice calling, “Rip Van
Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!” He caught sight of a strange figure climbing
up the rocks, carrying something on its back. Rip was surprised to see
any human being in this lonely place, but he concluded that it must be
one of his neighbors in need of assistance. Rip hurried down to help. The
stranger was a short old fellow with a grizzled beard. His clothes were
old-fashioned. He made signs for Rip to assist him, and together they
clambered up a narrow gully. Every now and then long rolling **peals** like
thunder seemed to issue out of a deep ravine. Passing through this ravine,
they came to a hollow.


In the center was a company of odd-looking persons playing at
**ninepins** . The thunderous noise Rip had heard from afar was the sound
of the ball rolling toward the pins. Like Rip’s guide, they were dressed
in an outlandish fashion, with enormous **breeches** . What seemed
particularly odd to Rip was that these folks looked very serious indeed.
They played without speaking and were, in fact, the most **melancholy**
party he had ever witnessed. They stared at Rip in such a way that his
heart turned within him and his knees banged together.


Rip and his guide joined the party. Before long, the events of the
day and the mountain air overpowered Rip, and he fell into a deep
sleep.

**Literal.** Look at the image on page 73. Work with your neighbor to identify people
and objects mentioned in the text that are shown in the image.


» Students should be able to identify the two men at the inn who are identified by

name in the text (Van Bummel, standing with the newspaper in his hands, and

Nicholas Vedder, sitting on the bench), as well as the portrait of King George III

hanging above the door of the inn.

Challenge


What clue does the portrait

of King George III hanging

above the door of the inn

provide about the time
period in which this part of

the story takes place?


The text refers to His
Majesty, suggesting
that King George is the
present king, so this part
of the story likely takes
place before or during the
Revolutionary War.

Lesson 15 Rip Van Winkle



**303**


**304**



Upon waking, Rip found himself on the green hill where he had
first seen the old man. It was a bright, sunny morning. “Surely,” thought
Rip, “I have not slept here all night.” He recalled the strange men. “Oh!
What excuse shall I make to Dame Van Winkle?” He looked around
for his gun, but found only an old, rusty firearm. Suspecting he had
been robbed, he decided to find the old-fashioned men and demand
his gun. As he rose to walk, he found himself stiff in the joints. With
some difficulty, he found the gully up which he and his companion
had ascended, but could find no traces of the ravine that had led to the
area with the odd little men playing ninepins. He shouldered the rusty
firearm and, with a heart full of trouble, turned his steps homeward.


As he approached the village, he met a number of people, but none
whom he knew. This surprised him, for he thought he was acquainted
with every one of his neighbors. Their dress, too, was of a different
fashion. They all stared at him with surprise and stroked their chins.
When Rip did the same, he found to his astonishment that his beard
had grown a foot long! A troop of children ran at his heels, hooting
after him and pointing at his gray beard. There were houses in the
village that he had never seen before, with unfamiliar names over the

village that he had never seen before, with unfamiliar names over the
doors. He began to wonder whether both he and the world around him
were bewitched.


With some difficulty he found his own house. The roof had fallen
in and the door was off its hinges. He entered and called for his wife
and children, but all was silent. He spotted a dog that looked like his
own and called out to him, but the dog snarled and showed his teeth.
“My own dog has forgotten me,” sighed poor Rip.


He hurried to the village inn. Before it now hung a flag with stars
and stripes. He spotted the face of King George on the sign, but now
his red coat was blue, his head wore a cocked hat, and underneath the
figure was printed GENERAL WASHINGTON. There was a crowd of
people around the door, but none that Rip knew. He inquired, “Where’s
Nicholas Vedder?”


**77**


**Inferential.** Look at the image at the bottom of page 76. What is happening in
the picture?


» It appears that the odd little men are putting Rip Van Winkle under a spell.


**Inferential.** _Bewitched_ means under a spell. Why does Rip Van Winkle wonder
whether he and the world around him are under a spell? Cite specific examples from
the text.


» Answers may vary, but may include that everyone and everything seems strange

to him upon waking; he is unable to find his gun; unable to find familiar paths; has

There was silence. Then an old man replied, “Nicholas Vedder?
Why he is dead and gone these eighteen years!”


“Where’s Van Bummel, the schoolmaster?” asked Rip.


“He went off to the wars and is now in Congress,” the old man
answered.


Rip’s heart sank at hearing of these sad changes. “I’m not myself,”
he said sadly. “I was myself last night, but I fell asleep. Now everything
has changed, and I can’t tell who I am!”

The bystanders looked at each other in puzzlement. Then a young
woman pressed through the throng. She had a child in her arms, which,
frightened by the gray-bearded man’s looks, began to cry. “Hush, Rip,”
she murmured. “The old man won’t hurt you.”


The name of the child and the air of the mother awakened longago memories in Rip’s mind. He caught the mother in his arms and
said, “I am your father—young Rip Van Winkle once—old Rip Van
Winkle now! Does nobody know poor Rip Van Winkle?”


All stood amazed for a while. Then an old woman exclaimed, “Sure
enough! It is Rip Van Winkle! Welcome home again, old neighbor!
Why, where have you been these twenty years?”


Rip’s story was soon told, for the whole twenty years had been
to him but one night. Many were **skeptical**, but an old man who
was well-versed in the local traditions confirmed his story in the
most satisfactory manner. He assured the company that the Catskill
Mountains had always been haunted by strange beings, and that his
own father had once seen these odd little men playing ninepins in the
hollow of the mountain.


Rip’s daughter took him home to live with her. (Her mother had
died some years before.) Having arrived at that happy age when a man
can retire and rest, Rip took his place once more on the bench at the
inn and was **revered** as one of the wise, old men of the village. He used
to tell his story to every stranger that arrived. Some doubted the truth
of it, but the old villagers gave Rip full credit.


Even to this day, whenever a thunderstorm blows in, they say that
the odd little men are at their game of ninepins; and it is a common
wish of all **henpecked** husbands in the neighborhood, when life hangs
heavy on their hands, that they might take themselves up into the
Catskill Mountains in search of an adventure.

Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Unit Assessment**

  - Determine how many students will be assessed for fluency, and make that

number of copies of the Recording Copy of “Patrick Henry” and the Fluency
Scoring Sheet.


**Start Lesson**


**Lesson 17: Unit Assessment**


~~**UNIT ASSESSMENT (90 MIN.)**~~


  - Make sure each student has a copy of Activity Page 16.1. You may have Activity Page 16.1
collected this activity page from students at the beginning of the unit.


  - Tell students they will read two selections, answer questions about each, and
respond to a writing prompt. In the next sections, they will answer grammar
and morphology questions evaluating the skills they have practiced in this unit.
Students are expected to write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.


  - Encourage students to do their best.


  - Once students have finished the assessment, encourage them to review their
papers quietly, rereading and checking their answers carefully.


  - Circulate around the room as students complete the assessment to ensure
that everyone is working individually. Assist students as needed, but do not
provide them with answers.


**Reading Comprehension**


The reading comprehension section of the Unit Assessment contains
two selections and accompanying questions. The first selection is an
informational piece about Benjamin Franklin and the Revolutionary War. The
second selection is a fictional excerpt from a boy’s diary during the start of
the American Revolution.


These texts are considered worthy of students’ time to read and meet the
expectations for text complexity at Grade 4. The texts feature core content
and unit vocabulary from the American Revolution unit that students can
draw on in service of comprehending the text.


Lesson 16 Unit Assessment



**313**


~~**OPTIONAL FLUENCY ASSESSMENT**~~


You may wish to assess students’ fluency in reading, using the selection
“Patrick Henry.”


**Administration Instructions**

 - Turn to the student copy of “Patrick Henry” that follows the Unit Assessment
Analysis section. This is the text students will read aloud. Turn to this copy
each time you administer this assessment.


 - Using one Recording Copy of “Patrick Henry” for each student, create a
running record as you listen to each student read orally.


 - Call the student you will assess to come sit near you.


 - Explain that you are going to ask them to read a selection aloud, and you
are going to take some notes as they read. Also, explain that they should not
rush but rather read at their regular pace.


 - Read the title of the selection aloud for the student, as the title is not part of
the assessment.


 - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the selection. As the
student reads aloud, make a running record on the Recording Copy using the
following guidelines:





|Words read correctly|No mark is required.|
|---|---|
|**Omissions**|Draw a long dash above the word omitted.|
|**Insertions**|<br> <br>Write a caret (^) at the point where the insertion was made.<br>If you have time, write down the word that was inserted.|
|**Words read incorrectly**|Write an “X” above the word.|
|**Substitutions**|Write the substitution above the word.|
|**Self-corrected errors**|Replace the original error mark with an “SC.”|
|**Teacher-supplied**<br>**words**|Write a “T” above the word (counts as an error).|


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation



**314**


  - When one minute has elapsed, draw a vertical line on the Recording Copy

to mark where the student was in the text at that point. Allow the student to
finish reading the selection aloud.


  - Assess the student’s comprehension of the selection by asking them to

respond orally to the following questions:


1. **Literal.** How did people describe Patrick Henry as a boy?


» idle, shiftless, will never amount to anything


2. **Inferential.** What was the “same old story” referring to once Patrick Henry

got married?


» He did the same thing he had done as a child—he didn’t take care of the farm his

parents had given him and let things drift.


3. **Literal.** What did Patrick Henry try again after his farm failed?


» storekeeping


4. **Literal.** What did Patrick Henry do well in?


» his law practice


  - Repeat this process for additional students as needed. Scoring can be done

later, provided you have kept running records and marked the last word
students read after one minute elapsed.


**Unit Assessment Analysis**


Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of the Text


The texts used in the reading comprehension assessment, “Benjamin
Franklin and the Revolutionary War” (informational text) and “A Fictional
Excerpt from a Boy’s Diary, Written in New York City, New York—July 11,
1776” (literary text), have been profiled for text complexity using standard
quantitative measures.

Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


**Patrick Henry**


As a boy, Patrick Henry did not like to study or work on his father’s farm.
His delight was to wander through the woods, gun in hand, hunting for
game, or to sit on the bank of some stream fishing by the hour. When not
outdoors, he might be heard playing his violin.


The neighbors said, “A boy so idle and shiftless will never amount to
anything.” His parents did not know what to do with him. When he was
fifteen years old, they had him work as a clerk in a little country store. Here
he remained for a year, and then opened a store of his own. But he was still
too lazy to attend to business, and soon failed.


When he was only eighteen years old, he married. The parents of the young
couple gave them a small farm and a few enslaved people. But it was the
same old story. Patrick did not take care of the farm and let things drift.
Before long, the farm had to be sold to pay debts. Once more Patrick turned
to storekeeping, but after a few years he failed again.


At the age of twenty-three years, he decided to become a lawyer. He
borrowed some law books, and after studying for six months, he applied
for permission to practice law.


He did well in his law practice. In a few years, he had so much business
that people in his part of Virginia began to take notice of him. In 1765, soon
after the Stamp Act was passed by the British Parliament, he was elected
a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses.

Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


**Guidelines for Fluency Assessment Scoring**

  - To calculate a student’s W.C.P.M. (Words Correct Per Minute) score, use the

information you wrote on the Recording Copy and follow these steps. You
may wish to have a calculator available.


1. _Count Words Read in One Minute_ . This is the total number of words the
student read or attempted to read in one minute. It includes words the
student read correctly as well as words the student read incorrectly. Write
the total in the box labeled Words Read in One Minute.


2. _Count the Uncorrected Mistakes in One Minute._ You noted these on
the Recording Copy. They include words read incorrectly, omissions,
substitutions, and words you had to supply. Write the total in the box labeled
Uncorrected Mistakes in One Minute on the Fluency Scoring Sheet. (A
mistake that the student self-corrects is not counted as a mistake.)


3. _Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes in One Minute from Words Read in One_
_Minute to Get Words Correct._ Write the number in the box labeled W.C.P.M.
Although the analysis does not include any words the student read correctly
(or incorrectly) after one minute, you may use this information from your
Recording Copy for anecdotal purposes.


  - As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider.


It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.
scores. However, a major goal of Grade 4 is to read with sufficient fluency
to ensure comprehension and independent reading of school assignments
in this and subsequent grade levels. A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be
compared with the score of other students in the class (or grade level) and
also with the national fluency norms obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal
(2006). Hasbrouck and Tindal suggest that a score falling within 10 words
above or below the 50th percentile should be interpreted as within the
normal, expected, and appropriate range for a student at that grade level at
that time of year. For example, if you administered the assessment during
the fall of Grade 4, and a student scored 94 W.C.P.M., you should interpret
this as within the normal, expected, and appropriate range for that student.

Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


~~**MIDDLE-OF-YEAR ASSESSMENT**~~


You should spend no more than two days total on the MOY Assessment. There are three main group
components of the assessment: a written assessment of silent reading comprehension, a written
assessment of grammar, and a written assessment of morphology. Two other components, the oral
reading of words in isolation and the fluency assessments, are administered one-on-one with students.


The written assessment of silent reading comprehension is meant to be completed in one
90-minute block of time and will be administered on MOY Assessment Day 1. The grammar
and morphology assessments are meant to be completed during one 50-minute block and one
40-minute block of time on MOY Assessment Day 2.


In addition you will pull students aside, one at a time, and administer the Word Reading in Isolation
Assessment to students who scored 10 or fewer on the Reading Comprehension Assessment. As time allows
you may also administer the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment to students who scored between 11 and
13 on the Reading Comprehension Assessment. Administer the Fluency Assessment to all students.


After administering the MOY Assessment, you will complete an analysis summary of individual
student performance using the Grade 4 MOY Assessment Summary Sheet, found in each individual
student’s Activity Book (Activity Page A.2). See the Foundational Skills Instruction Appendix at the
end of Unit 1 to support students in advanced phonics.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


  - Prepare to distribute Activity Page A.1 that you may have collected from
students at the beginning of the unit.


  - Plan to have reading material available for students to select from and read
independently as they finish the MOY Assessment.


~~**MIDDLE-OF-YEAR ASSESSMENT**~~


During the first day of the two-day assessment, all students will complete
the Reading Comprehension Assessment (Activity Page A.1) independently.
It includes four passages and corresponding comprehension questions.
After students complete this portion of the assessment, use the MOY
Assessment Summary (Activity Page A.2), which you will have collected from
students, to analyze each student’s performance. Please score the Reading
Comprehension Assessment prior to Day 2 of the MOY Assessment, as you
will use the scores to determine which students should complete the Word
Reading in Isolation Assessment.


Beginning on Day 2 of the MOY Assessment, all students will work
independently on the Grammar Assessment (Activity Page A.3) and the
Morphology Assessment (Activity Page A.4).


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation


In addition you will pull students aside, one at a time, and administer the
Word Reading in Isolation Assessment to students who scored 10 or fewer on
the Reading Comprehension Assessment (and, as time allows, to students
who scored 11–13). Administer the Fluency Assessment to all students.


The Word Reading in Isolation Assessment uses Activity Page A.5 (Word
Reading in Isolation Assessment Scoring Sheet), which you will have
collected from students, as well as the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment
located under MOY Assessment Day 2 in this Teacher Guide. A Word Reading
in Isolation Analysis and a Word Reading in Isolation Remediation Guide have
also been included under MOY Assessment Day 2 in the Teacher Guide.


The Fluency Assessment uses Activity Pages A.2 and A.6 (which you may have
collected from students), as well as the student copy of the Fluency Assessment
text “Scout’s Honor” located under MOY Assessment Day 2 in this Teacher Guide.
of this Teacher Guide. You will use Activity Page A.6 (MOY Fluency Assessment
Recording Copy) to create a running record while students read the fluency
passage. Activity Page A.2 (MOY Assessment Summary) includes a Fluency
Assessment Scoring Sheet.


~~**READING COMPREHENSION ASSESSMENT (90 MIN.)**~~


 - Ensure each student has a copy of Activity Page A.1. You may have collected
this activity page from students at the beginning of the unit.


 - Have students work independently to complete the Reading Comprehension
Assessment on Activity Page A.1. Answers are provided on the next page. After
you have scored the assessment, record individual scores on each student’s MOY
Assessment Summary (Activity Page A.2).


The reading comprehension questions pertaining to these texts are aligned
to the standards and are worthy of students’ time to answer. Questions
have been designed so they do not focus on minor points in the text, but
rather, they require deep analysis. Thus, each item might thus address
multiple standards. In general the selected-response items address Reading
standards and the constructed-response items address Writing standards.
To prepare students for digital assessments, some items replicate how
technology may be incorporated in those assessments, using a paper and
pencil format.

**Reading Comprehension Assessment Analysis**


Students who answered 10 or fewer questions correctly out of 15 total
questions may have significant skill deficits. Administer the Word Reading in
Isolation Assessment and the Fluency Assessment to these students to gain
further insight as to possible weaknesses. Carefully analyze their performance
on the Reading Comprehension Assessment, the Word Reading in Isolation
Assessment, and the Fluency Assessment to determine whether students
may need to be regrouped to an earlier point of instruction in the grade-level
materials.


Administer the Fluency Assessment and, as time permits, the Word Reading
in Isolation Assessment to students who answered 11–13 questions correctly
out of 15 total questions. Use results from the Word Reading in Isolation
Assessment to identify gaps in the mastery of specific letter-sound spellings.


You do not need to administer the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment to
students who answered 14–15 questions correctly out of 15 total questions.
However, please administer the Fluency Assessment to determine whether
practice and progress monitoring in the area of fluency are warranted.

~~**MORPHOLOGY ASSESSMENT (40 MIN.)**~~


 - Make sure each student has a copy of Activity Page A.4. You may have
collected this activity page from the students at the beginning of the unit.


 - Have students work independently to complete the Morphology Assessment
on Activity Page A.4. Record all student scores into the Morphology
Assessment Scoring Sheet. To receive a point for multiple-part questions,
students must correctly answer all parts of the question.

~~**WORD READING IN ISOLATION ASSESSMENT (ONGOING)**~~


Begin to administer the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment individually
to all students who scored 10 or fewer on the Reading Comprehension
Assessment and, as time permits, to students who scored 11–13, in order to
gain further insight as to possible weaknesses.


This section of the MOY Assessment assesses single-word reading to identify the
specific letter-sound correspondences a student may have not yet mastered.


**Administration Instructions**

 - Locate the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment on the next page. Students
will read from this copy.


 - Cover all of the words with a sheet of paper before calling a student to
complete the assessment.


 - Tell the student they will read words aloud to you and that it is important to
do their best reading.


 - Uncover the first row of words by moving the paper down.


 - As the student reads a word, mark any incorrect letter-sound
correspondences above the word on the Word Reading in Isolation
Assessment Scoring Sheet (Activity Page A.5 that you collected from
students). Also, note whether the student incorrectly chunks letters into
syllables, leading to mispronunciation. If the student reads the word
correctly, place a check mark above the word.


 - If, after 10 seconds, the student is unable to read the word at all, simply tell
the student the word and move on. Mark an ‘X’ above the word on the scoring
sheet.

~~**WORD READING IN ISOLATION ANALYSIS**~~


The more words a student is able to read and the farther the student is able
to progress in the assessment, the stronger their preparation is for further
instruction. A Word Reading in Isolation Analysis chart and a Word Reading in
Isolation Remediation Guide are located in this lesson.


The number of words read correctly indicates the following:


 - Students who correctly score 43 or fewer words out of 63 appear to have
significant deficits in decoding and word recognition.


 - Students who correctly score 44–51 out of 65 words appear to have
adequate decoding and word recognition skills.


 - Students who correctly score 52–65 out of 65 words appear to have
outstanding decoding and word recognition skills.


After scoring the assessment, you might find it helpful to determine which
letter-sound correspondences students missed that caused them to score
below the benchmark for word recognition. Note that one-syllable words are
not included in the Syllabication Analysis.

~~**FLUENCY ASSESSMENT (ONGOING)**~~


This section of the MOY Assessment assesses students’ fluency in reading by
using the selection “Scout’s Honor” (literary text) located on the next page
of this Teacher Guide.


**Administration Instructions**

 - Turn to the student copy of “Scout’s Honor” on the next page. Students will
read from this copy.


 - Using the Recording Copy of “Scout’s Honor” (Activity Page A.6) for each
student, you will create a running record as you listen to each student
read orally.


 - Explain that the student will read a selection aloud while you take some
notes. Encourage the student not to rush and to read at their regular pace.


 - Read the title of the selection aloud for the student, as the title is not part of
the assessment.


 - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the selection. As the
student reads aloud, make a running record on the Recording Copy of the
text using the following guidelines:

|Words read correctly|No mark is required.|
|---|---|
|**Omissions**|Draw a long dash above the word omitted.|
|**Insertions**|<br>Write a caret (^) at the point where the<br>insertion was made. If you have time,<br>write down the word that was inserted.|
|**Words read incorrectly**|Write an ‘X’ above the word.|
|**Substitutions**|Write the substitution above the word.|
|**Self-corrected errors**|Replace original error mark with an ‘SC’.|
|**Teacher-supplied words**|<br>Write a ‘T’ above the word (counts as <br>an error).|



 - When one minute has elapsed, draw a vertical line on the Recording Copy to
mark the student’s place in the text at that point. Allow the student to finish
reading the selection aloud.

Scouts Honor
by Avi


1 Back in 1946, when I was nine, I worried that I wasn’t tough enough.

Tat’s why I became a Boy Scout. Scouting, I thought, would make a

man of me. It didn’t take long to reach Tenderfoot rank. You got that for

joining. To move up to Second Class, however, you had to meet three

requirements. Scout Spirit and Scout Participation had been cinchy. Te

third requirement, Scout Craf, meant I had to go on an overnight hike in

the country. In other words, I had to leave Brooklyn, on my own, for the



frst time in my life.

2 Since I grew up in Brooklyn in the 1940s, the only grass I knew was in 115

Ebbets Field where the Dodgers played. Otherwise, my world was made 126

of slate pavements, streets of asphalt (or cobblestone), and skies full of tall 139

buildings. Te only thing “country” was a puny pin oak tree at our curb, 153

which was noticed, mostly, by dogs. 159


3 I asked Scoutmaster Brenkman where I could fnd some country. Now, 170
whenever I saw Mr. Brenkman, who was a church pastor, he was dressed 183

either in church black or Scout khaki. When he wore black, he’d warn us 197
against hellfre. When he wore khaki, he’d teach us how to build fres. 210


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**342**


4 “Country,” Scoutmaster Brenkman said in answer to my question, “is

anywhere that has lots of trees and is not in the city. Many boys camp in

the Palisades.”



219

235

237



5 “Where’s that?” 239


6 “Just north of the city. It’s a park in Jersey.” 249


7 “Isn’t that a zillion miles from here?” 256


8 “Take the subway to the George Washington Bridge, then hike across.” 267


9 I thought for a moment, then asked, “How do I prove I went?” 280


10 Mr. Brenkman looked deeply shocked. “You wouldn’t lie, would you? What 291

about Scout’s honor?” 294


11 “Yes, sir,” I replied meekly. 299


Word Count: 300


Middle-of-Year Assessment
**343**


                  - Assess the student’s comprehension of the selection by asking them to
respond orally to the following questions:


1. **Inferential.** What does the word cinchy (paragraph 1) mean?


» Easy.


2. **Literal.** What is the lowest rank in the author’s Boy Scout troop?


» Tenderfoot.


3. **Inferential.** Why couldn’t the author meet his Scout Craft requirement

close to home?


» Because the author lived in the city and Scout Craft required hiking in the country.


4. **Inferential.** Where did the author most likely hear Mr. Brenkman warning

against hellfire?


» In church.


                 - Continue administering the Fluency Assessment as time permits.


                  - You may score the assessment later, provided you have kept running records
and marked the last word students read after one minute elapsed.


**Guidelines for Fluency Assessment Scoring**

                 - Use one Fluency Assessment Scoring Sheet for each student taking the
assessment. The Fluency Assessment Scoring Sheet appears on each
student’s MOY Assessment Summary (Activity Page A.2). To calculate a
student’s Words Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M) score, use the information
you recorded on the Recording Copy and follow these steps. You may wish to
have a calculator available.


1. Count Words Read in One Minute. This is the total number of words that the

student read or attempted to read in one minute. It includes words that the

student read correctly as well as words that the student read incorrectly.

Write the total in the box labeled Words Read in One Minute.


2. Count the Uncorrected Mistakes in One Minute. You noted these in the

running record. They include words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions,

and words that you had to supply. Write the total in the box labeled


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**344**


Uncorrected Mistakes in One Minute on the scoring sheet. Note that a mistake

that the student self-corrects should not be counted as a mistake.


3. Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes in One Minute from Words Read in One

Minute to get Words Correct. Write the number in the box labeled W.C.P.M.

Although the analysis does not include any words the student read correctly

(or incorrectly) after one minute, you may use this information from the

Recording Copy for anecdotal purposes.


As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider.


It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.
scores. However, a major goal of Grades 4 and 5 is to read with sufficient
fluency to ensure comprehension and independent reading of school
assignments in this and subsequent grade levels. A student’s W.C.P.M. score
can be compared with the score of other students in the class (or grade
level) and also with the national fluency norms obtained by Hasbrouck and
Tindal (2006). Hasbrouck and Tindal suggest that a score falling within 10
words above or below the 50th percentile should be interpreted as within
the normal, expected, and appropriate range for a student at that grade
level at that time of year. For example, if you administered the assessment
during the spring of Grade 4, and a student scored 113 W.C.P.M., you should
interpret this as within the normal, expected, and appropriate range for that
student.


**Oral Reading Fluency Norms from Hasbrouck and Tindal (2006)**

|Percentile|Spring Grade 4 W.C.P.M.|Fall Grade 5 W.C.P.M.|
|---|---|---|
|90|180|166|
|75|152|139|
|50|123|110|
|25|98|85|
|10|72|61|

**345**


**Interpreting End-of-Year Assessment Scores**


To determine students’ skill level for ongoing Grade 4 instruction, use the
results of three assessments: the Reading Comprehension Assessment, the
Word Reading in Isolation Assessment (if administered), and the Fluency
Assessment. Please refer to the Grade 4 Middle-of-Year Assessment
Summary (Activity Page A.2) and consider students’ performance on these
three assessments, in combination.


It is most challenging to analyze results for students with ambiguous
or borderline scores. This might include students who answered most
questions correctly on one passage of the Reading Comprehension
Assessment but not other passages, or this might include students whose
performance was uneven on the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment or
Fluency Assessment.


In analyzing results from the Reading Comprehension Assessment, be
aware that some students may not be strong test-takers. They may struggle
to answer the questions even if they read the selection and understood it.
You may wish to have students with borderline scores read the selection(s)
aloud to you and then discuss it with you so you can better determine if their
struggles are a result of comprehension difficulties or other factors.


In analyzing results from the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment,
remember that not all poor scores are the same.


Students who have difficulty reading one-syllable words may have a
major problem reading the words or spellings in question and need
intensive remediation.


Benchmark results for individual students are not included for the Grammar
Assessment or the Morphology Assessment. You should use the results of
the Grammar Assessment and the Morphology Assessment to determine the
extent to which students may benefit from the additional practice of certain
grammar and morphology skills taught in the program.

###### Pausing Point


~~**END-OF-UNIT CONTENT ASSESSMENT**~~


Use the first day of the Pausing Point to administer the assessment of
content knowledge acquired by reading _The Road to Independence_ . Make
sure each student has a copy of Activity Page PP.2. You may have collected
this activity page from students at the beginning of the unit.


  - Allow students as much time as they need to complete the assessment

during the first Pausing Point day. In most cases, this assessment will take

Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**350**


~~**PAUSING POINT FOR DIFFERENTIATION OF INSTRUCTION**~~


Please use the final days of this unit to address results of the Content
Assessment, Unit Assessment (for reading comprehension; fluency,
if applicable; grammar; and morphology), and Spelling Assessments.
We suggest you begin with the whole-class Read-Aloud and Extending
Knowledge activities to reinforce unit content and strengthen students’ skills
in reading across genres.


~~**EXTENDING KNOWLEDGE: HAMILTON AND BURR**~~


  - Ask students to review what happened at Valley Forge. _(Answers may vary,_

_but students should recall that George Washington and other members of the_
_Continental Army spent the winter of 1777 there. It was a very hard season,_
_with bitter cold, and the soldiers were already worn out from the fighting._
_Many of the soldiers were miserable during their stay at Valley Forge.)_


  - Explain that many soldiers who served in the Continental Army and spent

the winter at Valley Forge became famous for their actions in the American
Revolution. Others are most well-known for their actions beyond the
Revolutionary War. Two of those soldiers, Alexander Hamilton and Aaron
Burr, fought in the war and spent the winter at Valley Forge, but they are
perhaps most well-known today for their relationship with each other, which
culminated in a fateful duel in 1804.


  - Read _Aaron and Alexander: The Most Famous Duel in American History_ by

Don Brown and ask students to think about how these two men acted in
ways that reflected and contradicted the goals of the Revolution.


During the reading, use the following questions to facilitate discussion.


1. The book calls both Burr and Hamilton “smart,” though it notes that they

had very different educational experiences as young men. Describe those
differences.


» Burr was born into a family of educators and lived in a college community.

He received formal schooling as a young man. Hamilton’s family had fewer

connections to educational institutions, and he did not start college until he was

older. He was able to attend college because people in his community helped

pay for his education.


2. What is the key idea of the book, and what evidence supports it?


» The author explains the book’s key idea on the opening pages. Though Burr and


Pausing Point
**351**


Hamilton were very similar, they had a few critical differences that made them

fierce rivals. These differences and similarities appear throughout the book; for

example, it explains how they were both orphans (a similarity) but that they had

very different experiences with formal education as young men (a difference).


3. Ask students to name some of the text features in this book and explain how

they contribute to the text’s overall meaning.


» Answers may vary, but students should recognize that the images reinforce

both the differences and similarities between the men. For example, one spread

shows both men using the same word, “despicable,” to describe each other. The

Author’s Note offers additional information about their history.


4. What is the author’s perspective on these men, and how does he reveal this

perspective?


» The author explains in the Author’s Note that he feels sympathetic to Burr.


5. How did these men’s actions reflect and contradict the ideals of the

American Revolution?


» Answers may vary but should reflect evidence students have learned from

the unit. For example, they may say that both men were willing to fight for the

freedoms in which they believed, but by participating in a duel, they contradicted

the belief that all men are entitled to “life and liberty.”


~~**EXTENDING KNOWLEDGE: THE BILL OF RIGHTS**~~


                 - Ask students to review some reasons that the colonists rebelled against
England. _(Answers may vary, but students should recall that the colonists_
_believed their rights were being abused by England.)_


                 - Ask students to review the “unalienable rights” named in the Declaration of
Independence. _(“life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”)_


                 - Explain that after the United States achieved independence, its leaders had
to decide which rights the new nation would protect.


                 - Some of those rights are in the United States Constitution. However, leaders
eventually decided that the Constitution needed to name some other rights
explicitly to make sure that they stayed protected. To do this, they created
ten amendments to the Constitution. These amendments are known
collectively as the Bill of Rights.


                - Read _The Bill of Rights_ by James Madison and ask students to think about
which rights are guaranteed in this document.


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**352**


**The Bill of Rights**


Amendment I


Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or
of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition

(National Archives and Records Administration)


During the reading, use the following questions to facilitate discussion.


1. The Bill of Rights is a primary source document. A primary source document

is one that was written or created during the time period being studied.
Primary source documents often give us a window into certain perspectives
at a specific time in history. Whose perspective does this primary source
document show us and during what time?


» This shows the perspective of colonists, particularly revolutionaries, living at the

time that America became an independent nation.


2. Most parts of the Student Reader for this unit are secondary sources. Unlike

primary sources, secondary sources are written or created after the time
being studied by someone who did not experience or participate in the
events being described. Each type of source presents information about
a topic in a different way. What does the Student Reader tell us about the
rights colonists expected? How does the Bill of Rights connect to those
rights?


Unit 5 American Revolution: Building a Nation
**354**


» Answers may vary but should reflect material from the texts. For example, the

Student Reader details that the colonists at the Second Continental Congress

wanted to make their own decisions concerning the American postal service,

currency, and military.


3. Compare the rights promised in the Bill of Rights with those of the

Declaration of Independence. What differences do you notice between the
rights named in each document?


» Answers may vary, but students should base their answers on the text. For

example, the Declaration of Independence covers basic rights of all humans. The

Bill of Rights names more specific rights to explain how the government should

treat its citizens. For example, people are guaranteed a jury trial, and they may

speak freely.


**Remediation**


Content


For a detailed description of remediation strategies, which address lagging
skills in Reading Comprehension, Fluency, Language, and Writing, refer to the
Program Guide.


Writing


Use time during the Pausing Point to return students’ cause-and-effect essay
drafts, along with the completed Cause-and-Effect Essay Rubric and Editing
Checklist. Meet briefly with individual students to discuss areas in which
improvement is needed. You may wish to allow students additional time to
revise and edit their cause-and-effect essays. You may also wish to allow
students to publish their cause-and-effect essays by recopying their revised
and edited draft onto a clean page.


You may wish to suggest that students needing more practice write a new
cause-and-effect essay on a different topic, such as the French and Indian
War. Provide additional structure and guidance for students, making copies
of both the Cause-and-Effect Essay Rubric and Editing Checklist available
(see Student Resources in the Activity Book). Circulate and check in with
students as they write.


**Enrichment**


If students have mastered the content and skills in the American Revolution
unit, their experience with the unit concepts may be enriched by the
following activities:


Pausing Point
**355**


Activity Pages
1.3 and 6.2




 - Students may read the enrichment selections contained in the Reader. The
first selection, “Points of View,” illustrates two sides to every issue, with
examples from the Revolutionary War, including colonists, British, enslaved
Africans, and Native Americans. The second selection, “Artillery Training,” is
an engaging dialogue between an army sergeant and his men as the sergeant
instructs his soldiers in the proper care and use of field cannons in the 1770s.


 - Students may respond to any of the following writing prompts, conducting
independent research necessary to support their response:


 - Research the impact of the American Revolution on other countries around
the world. Are there any rights guaranteed in the constitution here that
appear in the constitutions of other countries? Were there other revolutions
for democracy after that of the United States?


 - Imagine you are a writer for a newspaper in England during the 1770’s.
Choose an event from the American Revolution that you would like to write
about and turn it into an interesting story for the people of England. Your
story should include answers to the questions, _Who, What, Where, How, and_
_When?_ Be sure to include a headline for your story, too!


 - If I had lived in Boston in 1775, I would . (Describe who you are and

state your point of view regarding American independence, citing three
reasons that influence your point of view.)


 - Students may share, either with a small group or with the class, the writing
they generated in this unit or in response to the writing prompts in this
Enrichment section.


**Timeline**

 - This would be an appropriate time to have students cut out their completed
timelines from Activity Pages 1.3 and 6.2, taping them together to see the
sequence of events leading up to the American Revolution and Revolutionary
War and ending with the Treaty of Paris. You may suggest that students
make either two separate timelines (Activity Pages 1.3 and 6.2) or one long
timeline (attach both timelines).

~~**EMBEDDING THE EDITING PROCESS**~~


Revising and editing can be challenging for students. It may be helpful to follow

the steps below to help your students as they revise and edit their own work.


This process can be done at the sentence level, in addition to extended written

pieces. By using students’ quick writes and shorter responses, instructional

time can be maximized and the writing process will be authentic to what

students are composing.


**Steps for Successful Editing**


1. Model the editing process during writing instruction and target a single skill at

a time.


2. Select a text with errors to provide guided practice in small groups.


3. Partner or pair students for collaborative practice using pre-selected texts with

errors.


4. Provide opportunities for students to practice independently by editing their

own work or the work of a peer.


5. Conference with students in small groups or individually to provide corrective

and informative feedback.


6. Repeat the process by modeling a new grammar or convention skill.


**Last, but not least...**

 - Start with single sentences before moving onto longer pieces of writing.


 - Explicit grammar lessons can be reinforced using a variety of texts. Use

sentences from Read-Aloud or Student Reader texts to use as mentor

sentences.


 - Have students apply their understanding of a targeted skill in their short and

extended constructed responses.


 - Provide rehearsal opportunities during collaborative and independent writing

time.


 - Grammar is best taught in the context of student writing.


 - Incorporate spelling practice including use of high frequency words in written

compositions.

**Guidance for Teacher Use of Rubrics**


Rubrics are provided for evaluation of the content and structure of student writing composed within
each unit. The criteria within the descriptions correspond to what is taught in the writing lessons.
“Exemplary” to “Beginning” performance columns provide graduated descriptions for each criterion.
The columns for “Strong,” “Developing,” and “Beginning” performance are shaded to help students
initially attend to the description for “Exemplary” performance. The rubrics allow teachers and
students to identify graduated steps for improvement when aspects of the writing do not meet all
the taught criteria. To do this, teachers (and students) may highlight the language from each row
that best describes the student writing.

**Guidance for Teacher Use of Editing Checklists**


Editing checklists allow students and teachers to evaluate students’ command of language
conventions and writing mechanics within unit writing projects. They serve a different purpose
than rubrics; rubrics measure the extent to which students apply specific instructional criteria
they have been building toward across the unit, whereas editing checklists measure the extent to
which students apply English language conventions and general writing mechanics. With regard to
expectations for accountability, we recommend using the editing checklist to measure students’
command of language conventions and writing mechanics only when students have received the
appropriate instructional support and specific opportunity to review their writing for that purpose.


Evaluating Student Writing


Make enough copies of the rubric and editing checklist found in this section for evaluating each
student’s writing piece.


~~**RESOURCES FOR THE ENRICHMENT SELECTIONS IN THE ROAD TO INDEPENDENCE**~~


The enrichment selections in The Road to Independence are intended to be used at your discretion.
They are intended to be read by more advanced readers, as they are more difficult to read and
include more challenging vocabulary than Chapters 1–9. You may want to assign these selections to
students who need more challenging reading material. An introduction to the selections is provided
here. Core vocabulary is also listed for each selection; these words are bolded in the Reader and
appear in the glossary.


**Core Vocabulary for “Points of View”**


“Points of View” describes the events of the American Revolution from the varying historical figures’
or groups’ viewpoints. This selection helps students better understand that conflicts in history can
be understood by thinking about events from different historical perspectives. Activity Page E1.1
corresponds to this enrichment selection.


The following core vocabulary words are bolded in the selections and appear in the glossary. Remind
students they can look up a word in the glossary if needed.


**so-called, adj.** implying the name or description of something or someone may be

inaccurate (80)


**tyrannical, adj.** ruling people in a threatening or cruel way (80)


**oppressive, adj.** harsh and unfair; cruel (80)

|ELPS 4.C|<br> <br> <br>develop basic sight vocabulary, derive meaning<br>of environmental print, and comprehend English<br>vocabulary and language structures used routinely in<br>written classroom materials|p. 86, p. 221|
|ELPS 4.D|<br> <br> <br>use prereading supports such as graphic organizers,<br>illustrations, and pretaught topic-related vocabulary<br>and other prereading activities to enhance<br>comprehension of written text||
|ELPS 4.E|<br> <br>read linguistically accommodated content area<br>material with a decreasing need for linguistic<br>accommodations as more English is learned||
|ELPS 4.F|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>use visual and contextual support and support from<br>peers and teachers to read grade-appropriate content<br>area text, enhance and confirm understanding, and<br>develop vocabulary, grasp of language structures,<br>and background knowledge needed to comprehend<br>increasingly challenging language|p. 15, p. 57, p. 61, p. 195, p. 221, p. 278|
|ELPS 4.G|<br> <br> <br> <br>demonstrate comprehension of increasingly complex<br>English by participating in shared reading, retelling or<br>summarizing material, responding to questions, and<br>taking notes commensurate with content area and<br>grade level needs||
|ELPS 4.H|<br>read silently with increasing ease and comprehension<br>for longer periods||
|ELPS 4.I|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>demonstrate English comprehension and expand<br>reading skills by employing basic reading skills such<br>as demonstrating understanding of supporting ideas<br>and details in text and graphic sources, summarizing<br>text, and distinguishing main ideas from details<br>commensurate with content area needs|p. 57, p. 61, p. 92, p. 214|
