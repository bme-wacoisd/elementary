## Introduction

Welcome to the _Eureka! Files_ .

As a contestant on _Eureka! Student Inventor_ you are entitled
to one (1) copy of the _Eureka! Files_ . Guard it carefully. We’ve
seen what inventing without any reading can look like and it’s
not pretty. You will need to refer to these articles throughout the
Quest. You will not be able to complete the Wheel of Invention
without them.

In this collection you will find:

   - a carefully preserved transcript from an episode from last
season that the network would just as soon forget

   - uncensored, frank articles about your judges

   - notes from experienced inventors

   - information about inventions

   - challenging vocabulary is in bold and defined in the
glossary at the back.

These documents are only the beginning—remember that
you can earn bonus points for reading and creating inventor
cards for additional inventors. There are no rules against extra
research in this Quest.

Good luck, contestants!

Eureka! Files | Transcript 5


One day he rescued a child from the path of a moving
train, and the boy’s father, who was trained to operate a **tele-**
**graph**, offered him lessons in telegraphy. He soon became a
telegraph operator and before long was inventing remarkable
improvements to the telegraph that got the attention of **finan-**
**ciers** . With their support, he opened a laboratory in Menlo
Park, New Jersey.




**-**




**-**



His lab was the first of its kind. It was a busy place where
experts collaborated, working on multiple inventions at the
same time. Research and **marketing** happened under one
roof. In this idea-rich environment, Edison invented the **pho**
**nograph** —the first device for recording sound!—and the
incandescent light bulb, his most famous invention.




**-**



By the time he died, in 1931, Edison had patented an
astounding 1,093 inventions in the United States, and more
abroad. These also include the Kinetoscope (which launched
the movie industry), the microphone, the rechargeable battery,
and a cement manufacturing process. Edison believes this list
cements his place in history.

## Jacques Cousteau
###### Lover of croissants and aquatic life, seafaring Frenchman Jacques Cousteau returns to Eureka!’s judging panel

Producers are frustrated that Jacques Cousteau has returned
this season as a judge on _Eureka!_, despite the fact that he was
not invited back after the mess he caused last season. Jacques,
however, is thrilled to be on the panel, and claims that this will
be _Eureka!’_ s most exciting season ever!

Jacques Cousteau likes excitement. Born on June 11, 1910,
in the small town of Saint-André-de-Cubzac, France, Cousteau
was a curious child. Although not a good student, he was always
building things and taking things apart to see how they worked.
At age twenty-six he was in a terrible car accident that required
months of **rehabilitation** . Armed with a pair of goggles, he
began swimming daily in the sea. He quickly realized that he
wanted to be able to explore the ocean, but to do so he would
need better equipment for breathing under water. So he decided
to try inventing it.


Cousteau and his inventing partner developed the AquaLung, which allowed people to stay under water while breathing
from air cylinders (small tanks that can hold hours’ worth of
air). This advance opened human eyes to **aquatic** life in a new
way, and also allowed for undersea rescues and recoveries that
would have been impossible before.

Cousteau also helped invent a deepwater camera. (As an
**avid** undersea explorer he wanted to share with the world what
he experienced in person.) He increased interest in underwater
archeology by **spearheading** the exploration of a famous
Roman shipwreck. He went on to lead many more explorations,
to write books, and to make films about his voyages and about
ocean life. His television series, _The Undersea World of Jacques_
_Cousteau_, was so popular it ran for eight years (a distant hope
for _Eureka!_ ).

Jacques died at the age of eighty-seven in Paris, on land. But
he was most himself when he was at sea. He once said, “From
birth, man carries the weight of gravity on his shoulders. He is
bolted to earth. But man has only to sink beneath the surface
and he is free.”

## George Washington Carver
###### Peanut expert George Washington Carver joins Eureka! as judge, brings love of plants, general human kindness to program

Producers are pleased to announce that well-known inventor, professor, and all-around good guy George Washington
Carver has joined the cast of _Eureka!_ Carver brings to the
judging panel a love of research, a deep knowledge of plant life
and **agricultural** inventions, and a much-needed friendly and
**optimistic** perspective.

A biography of George Washington Carver might as well
also be a biography of the peanut. And the sweet potato.
Carver **arguably** devoted more time, care, and love to these
two crops—finding over 400 new uses for them—than any
person devoted to plant life before or since. The road to **bot-**
**any** -based greatness wasn’t easy, however. Carver was born
into slavery in Diamond, Missouri, around January 1864 (he
wasn’t sure of his exact birth date). He could not enroll at the
first college to which he’d been admitted because of his race.
When he finally started college in 1890, he studied painting


lege in Iowa, did not have a science program. But these studies
led him back to science and nature when an instructor was
impressed by his pictures of plants. The instructor pointed
Carver toward Iowa State Agricultural College’s botany program, where he was the first black student.

This is where his unlikely career **took root** . He was a
talented **botanist** and was soon hired to lead the **prestigious**
Tuskegee Institute’s agricultural department. While at Tuskegee,
Carver set out to help struggling farmers and **sharecroppers** in
the South. He worked hard to get the latest information about
farming methods to them, even in remote locations, to help
them remain **self-sufficient** . Until this time farmers in the
South had produced mostly cotton. Carver helped to introduce
many more cash crops—crops that could be sold for money. He
also instructed farmers to grow crops that broke down the soil,
such as cotton one year, and then the next year to grow crops
that improved the quality of the soil, such as peanuts, sweet
potatoes, peas, and soybeans. This method of **crop rotation**
kept the soil rich and **fertile** .

Carver became an inventor when he turned his attention to
finding new uses for some of these new crops. He developed
countless paints, dyes, and plastics made from peanuts, sweet
potatoes, pecans, and soybeans. And, of course, he is often
credited with inventing (or at least popularizing) peanut butter!
When asked why he didn’t try to make a personal **profit** from
his inventions, he said, “God gave them to me. How can I sell
them to someone else?”

## Hedy Lamarr
###### Brainy beauty Hedy Lamarr reluctantly agrees to judge season two of Eureka!, citing boredom and a salary that will help pay for her guilty pleasure: strudel

Producers are reportedly “OK” with Hedy Lamarr rejoining
_Eureka!_ as a judge. For her part, Ms. Lamarr claims “ **indiffer-**
**ence** ” about returning to the panel. Her hopes for the student
contestants include that they don’t give her a head cold, or lice.

Born on November 9, 1914, as Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler,
to Jewish parents in Vienna, Austria, Hedy Lamarr changed her
name in the early 1940s and became a movie star known for her
stunning looks. But there was more to Hedy Lamarr than starring roles in popular Hollywood films and great beauty. She was
also an avid inventor.

Her inventing began out of a need to entertain herself. She
disliked Hollywood parties, so she had free time. She dedicated a
room in her house entirely to inventing. Some of the things she
developed there were everyday items (a better traffic signal, an
improved Kleenex box—neither of which succeeded). But some
of her other inventions were advanced technologies. She is best


known as an inventor for coming up with _**frequency**_ _hopping_, the
concept of changing the frequencies of the radio signals steering
a torpedo so that an enemy would not be able to block them. She
and her friend and inventing partner, a composer named George
Antheil, stumbled on the idea when discussing a piece of music
he’d composed that made use of **synchronized** **player pianos** .
The two hoped to help America in World War II with their idea.
It was acquired by the US Navy, but the navy never found a way
to use it. It took twenty more years for the idea to be put to use,
a major disappointment to Lamarr. Today a more advanced
version of frequency hopping is used in wireless phones, GPS—
anything that makes use of Wi-Fi.

Lamarr never profited from the idea and she was rarely
appreciated for her brilliant mind. This oversight **irked** her to
no end and certainly contributes to her sometimes, shall we say,
“quick-tempered” responses on _Eureka!_


Lamarr’s patent sketches

that. In 1930 my husband Kenneth and I opened a restaurant
near Boston called the Toll House Inn. The Inn was my pride
and joy, and I took its operation very seriously. Some have
suggested I was a bit of a tyrant with the staff, and I don’t deny
it. If a waitress wasn’t able to fold a napkin exactly right, I would
suggest that perhaps her skills were better suited to one of those
“ **greasy spoons** .” Yes, I wanted my restaurant to be the best,
and I’m fairly certain that’s no crime. Therefore I was always
trying to come up with new dishes and desserts to attract more
business. So I set out, _quite_ _**deliberately**_, to invent a new cookie.
And, after some trial and error with different ingredients,
I created the chocolate-chip cookie in 1938 by improving a
butterscotch cookie already on the menu. That’s all there is to it.

And while I know quite well that my cookie did not change
the course of history, I’ll leave you with this question. If you were
stranded on a desert island, which would you prefer to have with
you—a box of light bulbs or a box of chocolate-chip cookies?

## The Light Bulb

###### BEFORE THE LIGHT BULB: Life in the Dark

For most of human history, people got up at sunrise and
didn’t do much after sunset because there wasn’t much light
indoors and traveling in the dark was dangerous—people could
easily get lost or fall and hurt themselves.

Of course people lit their homes before the light bulb, but
there were lots of **drawbacks** to these early sources of light.
Candles, for example, didn’t give off much light. Wood fires
took a lot of effort to build and gave off unwanted heat when
the weather was warm. Some species of whales almost became
extinct because the oil in their blubber was used as fuel for oil
lamps. Accidental fires were a problem with all of these light
sources and with the gas lamps that became popular in the
nineteenth century.
###### INVENTING THE LIGHT BULB: Edison’s Innovation

Electric lights existed before Thomas Edison’s light bulb,
but they were expensive and unreliable, and the lighting was
very **dim** . One reason is that early inventors could not come up
with a proper filament, which is the tiny wire that runs through
the center of a light bulb. When the filament heats up, it glows,
which is the source of the bulb’s light. Before Edison, inventors
made filaments from metals that would catch fire at the slightest
heat. As a result the bulbs burned out very quickly, or the


28 Invention | Eureka! Files


filament would burn so hot that the bulb would explode. Starting in 1878, Edison experimented for two years before he came
up with a **charred** bamboo filament that provided 1,200 hours of
**illumination** .
###### HOW THE LIGHT BULB CHANGED THINGS: The Impact

As a smart businessman, Edison realized the **potential** in
selling both light bulbs and electricity. He quickly started a
company to supply electricity to customers, and in 1882 his first
power station lit up fifty-nine homes in New York City.

Almost every part of our lives has been affected by electric
light. Think about all the things people do before sunrise or
after sunset that would not have been possible before the light
bulb. Today, factories that would have shut down at night can
run around the clock because of the light bulb. The headlights
on all sorts of vehicles, including ambulances and fire engines,
allow for safe travel after dark. And nighttime activities that we
take for granted, from sleepovers to concerts to reading in bed,
would be more difficult or impossible without electric light.
The light bulb also led to lots of other inventions, because once
electric outlets were installed in homes, many inventors realized
that things other than lamps could be plugged into these outlets.
They then got busy inventing all sorts of home appliances—like
the toaster, dishwasher, and electric fan—that make our lives
easier and more comfortable.

## Paper

###### BEFORE PAPER: A Record-Keeping Nightmare

Throughout most of history, only a very small amount of
human knowledge was ever written down. Most knowledge was
communicated through spoken words. This meant that what
a person knew was limited to what they could remember. One
reason for this is that writing was very inconvenient. The writing surface made from the papyrus plant in ancient Egypt was
extremely fragile. In other parts of the world people wrote on
vellum, a **parchment** made from animal skin. But vellum was
expensive and time-consuming to produce.

Almost two thousand years ago, around the year 105, a man
named Cai Lun was keeping official government records for
the Chinese Emperor He of Han. At that time in China people
wrote on silk, which was very expensive, or on scrolls of bamboo, which were very heavy and difficult to manufacture. Cai
Lun was frustrated with those choices and believed he could
come up with a better option—a writing surface that was light,
cheap, and easy to make.
###### INVENTING PAPER: The First Paper

Cai Lun experimented with lots of different materials and
methods before discovering his winning formula: He mixed
tree bark, old cloth, and discarded pieces of rope and fishing
nets in a big kettle of boiling water. As the water **evaporated**, he
mashed up the mush that was left into a paste, which he then


32 Invention | Eureka! Files


set to dry on screens in thin layers. As they dried, these layers
of Cai Lun’s strange mixture hardened into the first sheets of
paper! Cai Lun’s lightweight invention made writing, transporting, and storing records much easier. Emperor He was very
pleased. He rewarded Cai Lun with great wealth. Neither of
them could have predicted that a few hundred years later the
Chinese would find two new uses for Cai Lun’s invention that
would become hugely popular: paper money and toilet paper.
###### HOW PAPER CHANGED THINGS: Portable Knowledge

Cai Lun’s invention changed civilization. People could now
spread knowledge of science, literature, and art over great
distances by carrying paper documents with them when they
traveled. Paper also helped people communicate across hundreds and even thousands of years because stories, poems,
artwork, and history could now be recorded, stored, and copied
over generations. By allowing political thinkers to share their
ideas with many people, paper also toppled mighty kings and
brought about great revolutions. For example, Tom Paine’s _Com-_
_mon Sense_, a pamphlet that **inspired** the American Revolution,
would not have been read up and down the thirteen colonies
had it not been printed on paper. Paper is also used for fun—
coloring books, comics, crosswords, and novels would not exist
without paper! Through the spread of books, paper has enabled
billions of people to learn to read, receive an education, and
read for pleasure.

## The Airplane

###### Leonardo’s Flying Machines



Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), the famous artist
who painted the _Mona Lisa_, was also a brilliant inventor.
About four hundred years before the Wright Brothers’
first flight, he was writing and sketching his ideas for
man-powered flying machines. After carefully studying the way birds and bats fly, da Vinci drew plans for
a human-powered flying machine with giant flapping
wings. He also sketched ideas for a helicopter. The technology for this kind of flight didn’t exist during his life,
so his ideas were ahead of their time.










###### BEFORE THE AIRPLANE: Flights before the Wrights

Human beings first flew in the year 1783 in a hot-air
balloon, but people wanted to do more than float in the sky. In
the 1800s, a German man named Otto Lilienthal made over
two thousand flights in gliders, motorless aircraft that ride air
currents as a bird does in between flapping its wings. As new
and more powerful engines were developed, lots of inventors
attached them to aircraft frames and tried to fly. They failed
because they didn’t understand that successful flight requires a
pilot to carefully balance and control the aircraft.


36 Invention | Eureka! Files


###### INVENTING THE AIRPLANE: The Wright Brothers Take Control

Orville and Wilbur Wright understood the importance of
control. That’s why they practiced flying and steering gliders for
two years before building the _Flyer_, their first motorized plane.
They succeeded in keeping the _Flyer_ **airborne** at Kitty Hawk,
North Carolina, in 1903 because they had installed controls to
keep the plane balanced and steady. Afterward they continued
experimenting for two more years, eventually building the _Flyer_
_III_ . That plane had improved controls to adjust its pitch (lifting
the nose or tail), roll (tilting from side to side), and yaw (steering right or left). These controls are still found on airplanes
today. They help planes take off, fly, and land much more safely,
especially in bad weather or high winds.


###### HOW THE AIRPLANE CHANGED THINGS: The Sky’s the Limit



It wasn’t long before people saw the potential of the Wright
Brothers’ invention. Planes began carrying mail in 1911. In
1914, at the start of World War I, France and Germany used
airplanes for military purposes for the first time, permanently
changing how wars are fought. That same year a businessman
in Florida started the very first airline, charging passengers five
dollars to fly between St. Petersburg and Tampa, Florida. In
1927 Charles Lindbergh made the first flight across the Atlantic Ocean. By the end of the next decade, an airline called Pan
Am was offering weekly passenger and mail flights between the
United States and England. A trip that had taken a week by boat
now took less than a day, with a few stopovers. Today that trip
takes less than seven hours on a jet.

Hundreds of millions of people travel on airplanes every
year. Airplanes have also saved countless lives by quickly bringing aid to areas hit by natural disasters. The Space Shuttle, a
descendent of the airplane, sent men, women, and equipment,
like communications satellites, into space. By making it possible
for us to travel the world, the airplane has helped people appreciate and value different cultures, as well as understand what all
people have in common.

## The Clock

###### BEFORE THE CLOCK: Telling Time



Even prehistoric men and women kept track of the passing
of time. They noted the sunrise and sunset, the locations of the
stars and planets, the changes in weather, and the cycle of the
moon. These clues helped them know when to plant, when to
hunt, and perhaps when to move to someplace warmer. As time
went on, people began measuring smaller units of time with
**sundials**, which told time using the direction and size of shadows cast by the sun. But sundials could not tell the exact time
and were of no use on cloudy days or at night. As people started
interacting with each other in more complicated ways, they
divided the day into twenty-four hours and needed more accurate ways of keeping track of those hours.










###### INVENTING THE CLOCK: Water Clocks

The next great innovation in timekeeping was the water
clock. The first water clocks, which the Egyptians started
using about 1400 BC, were simple bowls with holes carved
into them. If you knew how long it took for all the water to
flow out of a full bowl, you could measure the passage of time
by checking the water level. Over time water clocks improved,
and in the eleventh century a Chinese engineer named Su
Song built a water clock that was an architectural and mechanical wonder. Su Song’s clock was powered by a waterwheel


42 Invention | Eureka! Files


and stood forty feet high. **Intricate** puppets playing musical
instruments emerged from five different doors to announce
each hour. It also displayed the positions of the planets. Water
clocks like Su Song’s were the most accurate timepieces for
hundreds of years.


###### Keeping Time at Sea



As the centuries marched on, clocks became more accurate
as water power was replaced by springs and **pendulums** . However, these early clocks were very breakable and didn’t work
on ships because of all the motion caused by the sea. Sailors
were desperate for a clock that would keep working on a ship.
Knowing the time at home by using such a clock, and the time
on board, which they could calculate using the stars, would let
them figure out their ship’s exact longitude (its location on one
of the horizontal lines that circle a globe). Not knowing longitude often led to shipwrecks or ships becoming lost at sea. After
more than 1,400 British sailors drowned in 1707 because of the
“longitude problem,” a carpenter named John Harrison spent
almost fifty years designing clocks and watches that kept time at
sea. His inventions helped sailors navigate safely.












###### HOW THE CLOCK CHANGED THINGS: Time Marches On

As the number of clocks in the world continued to grow,
more and more people were better able to coordinate with one
another because of their shared understanding of time. Friends
who planned to get together at 10:30 a.m. instead of “midmorning” were much more likely to arrive at the same time. Clocks
also made workplaces run more smoothly because bosses could
plan and assign work knowing exactly when their employees
would be arriving and leaving. Railroads and airlines, which
need to operate according to schedules, would not have been
possible without clocks. And television stations need clocks to
schedule their programming. Let’s just hope the clock doesn’t
run out on _Eureka!_


Eureka! Files | Invention 45

## The Microscope

###### BEFORE THE MICROSCOPE: Bad Air

One reason doctors and scientists had difficulty curing
many diseases before the invention of the microscope is that
they couldn’t see the tiny **organisms** that often spread sickness. Until about 150 years ago, most people believed that dirty,
smelly air rising from rotting plants or dead animals formed a
poisonous gas that spread illness. This idea of bad air causing
disease made some sense at the time. After all, people could
smell the bad odor of rotten meat, but could not see germs.
A few scientists in ancient and medieval times suggested the
existence of tiny living organisms, but not many people believed
them. “Seeing is believing,” they thought. And by the middle of
the seventeenth century, no one had figured out how to examine
tiny objects and organisms.
###### INVENTING THE MICROSCOPE: An Amateur Inventor



In 1654 a young man named Antonie van Leeuwenhoek opened up a shop in Holland selling cloth and textiles.
Although he was a successful merchant, he was more interested in science, and began experimenting with glass lenses,
like those used in eyeglasses. Van Leeuwenhoek manufactured
a tiny lens that was double convex, which means the glass
bulged out on both sides of the lens, like two tiny domes. He
attached his lens to a brass plate and eureka!, he’d made a











48 Invention | Eureka! Files


microscope. He started studying the tiniest details of organisms like mold, bees, and lice, while working on improving his
lenses. By 1676 he had invented a microscope so powerful that
he was able to see single-celled organisms, like bacteria. He
wrote to a group of famous scientists in London about his discoveries, but they didn’t believe him. “Seeing is believing,” they
thought. But when they sent representatives to look through
the microscope themselves, they realized the importance of
van Leeuwenhoek’s invention.










###### HOW THE MICROSCOPE CHANGED THINGS: Tiny Organisms, Huge Impact

Over the years the microscope has been an important tool
in great scientific and medical discoveries. Thanks to the microscope, nineteenth-century scientists like Robert Koch and Louis
Pasteur were able to see the bacteria that cause many deadly
diseases. Once these bacteria had been identified, scientists
invented **vaccines** that saved millions of lives by preventing these
diseases. The microscope has also helped the environment. For
example, by studying river water samples, scientists have been
able to analyze and improve the health of **ecosystems** .

Van Leeuwenhoek’s most powerful microscope had a
magnification of 270, which means tiny objects appeared 270
times their actual size. Today’s most powerful microscopes can
achieve a magnification of ten million. Modern microscopes
have more uses than van Leeuwenhoek could have imagined.
They are used to manufacture tiny computer parts. They also
make possible many complicated medical procedures, like
surgery on the eyes and blood vessels.

## The Radio

###### BEFORE THE RADIO: Wired!

For most of the nineteenth century, many Americans lived
fairly **isolated** lives. They may not have ever traveled more than
twenty or thirty miles from their homes. For entertainment
they visited with neighbors, played cards and games, and maybe
danced, sang, and played music together. Concerts and the
theater were mostly for those who lived in cities. People didn’t
have much reason to communicate with those outside their
communities, and when they did it was by mail, which could
take weeks or months to arrive.

In 1861 the Western Union Company completed the first
transcontinental electric telegraph, connecting the East and
West Coasts of the United States. The telegraph was a machine
that sent coded messages over a wire in the form of electricity
in a matter of minutes. A telegraph operator tapped out the
message in code in one city, and then a second operator
decoded and wrote down the message in another city. At the


time the telegraph was the fastest and most efficient means
of communicating over long distances, but putting up the
wires (and making sure they stayed up) was so expensive that
telegraph companies did it only where there were significant
populations. This left many Americans who lived far from big

cities out of reach of the telegraph.
###### INVENTING THE RADIO: Wireless



In 1894 a young man in Italy named Guglielmo Marconi
read a book that explained electromagnetic waves—that’s electricity that travels through the air. He reasoned that if electricity
could travel through the air without a wire, then he could send
telegraph messages wirelessly. He quickly got to work in his attic
building a wireless **transmitter** (to send messages) and a wireless receiver (to receive messages). Soon Marconi was sending
wireless signals across the room, and by 1895 he was sending
them over a distance of a mile and a half.

Marconi wrote to an Italian official asking the government
for money to help him further develop his invention. The official thought he was crazy, so Marconi moved to England, where
he found people who believed in him. In 1898 Marconi sent a
wireless message across the **English Channel** to France, and
in 1902—only eight years after he built his first machine in the
attic—Marconi sent a wireless message all the way across the
Atlantic Ocean! Soon scientists and businesspeople realized
that the future of Marconi’s technology was in sending sound
directly to receivers in people’s homes. These receivers were
called radios.

###### HOW THE RADIO CHANGED THINGS: Radio Waves of the Future



The first commercial radio station began broadcasting in
1920, and by 1930, long before televisions were available, radios
were in twelve million American homes. Radio stations broadcast news, music, comedies, adventure shows, game shows, soap
operas, talent contests—almost everything you can see on TV
today. Lots of families gathered in the evenings to listen to the
radio the same way many families now watch TV together. And
along with the movies, the radio created national celebrities, as
many radio performers became superstars. Today the electromagnetic waves that Marconi first sent across his attic are also
used for cell phones, GPS, radar, and TV (including _Eureka!_ ),
and even to control satellites in outer space.

## The Telephone

###### BEFORE THE TELEPHONE: Voiceless Communication



For thousands of years, the only way for most people to stay
in touch with those who lived far from them was through the
mail, and letters could take weeks or even months to arrive.
In the middle of the nineteenth century an invention called
the telegraph was revolutionizing long-distance communication around the world. With the telegraph, an operator in one
city could transmit a message to an operator in another city in
minutes by sending an electric current over a wire. The telegraph did have some drawbacks, however. Most importantly,
the telegraph could not transmit sound—only a complicated
code of clicks that few people could understand. People couldn’t
hold back-and-forth conversations over a telegraph line. They
had to go to special telegraph offices to give their messages to
an operator to send, which meant messages were never completely private. And sending a message over the telegraph might
require a lot of traveling if you didn’t live in a city or town with
an office.














###### INVENTING THE TELEPHONE: The Voice!

The telegraph proved that electrical signals could be sent
across a wire. Alexander Graham Bell aimed to send the human
voice across a wire by turning it into electrical signals. In 1875
he was **tinkering** in his lab when he accidentally spilled acid


58 Invention | Eureka! Files


on his pants. He called to his assistant, Thomas Watson, who
was in the next room, where the receiver of Bell’s invention sat
on a table. Eureka! Watson heard Bell’s voice coming out of the
machine. The first phone call!



Bell worked on improving the invention and the next year,
he and Watson had a telephone conversation over a distance of
two miles. When Bell spoke into the telephone, his voice caused
a thin piece of parchment (the **diaphragm** ) to vibrate. A magnet turned those vibrations into electricity that traveled over
the telephone line. At Watson’s end, a second magnet and diaphragm turned the electrical signal back into sound vibrations.










###### HOW THE TELEPHONE CHANGED THINGS: A Ringing Success

By 1886 more than one hundred thousand Americans had
telephones in their homes. The country, and eventually the
world, became much more connected because people were
able to pick up their phones and speak to anyone anywhere.
Businesses saved money, as meetings that had once required
long-distance travel could now be held over the phone. People who lived in isolated areas were now able to call for help in
an emergency. News traveled more quickly and long-distance
friendships became possible. Eventually the telephone put the
telegraph out of business and became one of the most successful
inventions of all time.


## The Inclined Plane

An inclined plane is really just a ramp—a flat surface tilted
so that one side is higher than the other. It is the one simple
machine that doesn’t move, but it sure makes moving things
a lot easier.



Here’s an example of how it might be used: There is a rumor
going around that the network is thinking of replacing _Eureka!_
with a monkey modeling competition ( _Next Top Monkey_
_Model_, in case you were wondering). Now let’s say some network **bigwigs** are planning to load a barrel of beautiful **baboon**
contestants into the trailer of a truck to bring them down to
the studio. (Don’t worry, the barrel is equipped with air holes,
and magnifying mirrors for last-minute makeup application).
The barrel may be too heavy to lift into the truck, but it’s probably not too heavy to roll up an inclined plane into the trailer.
That’s because by lifting the barrel, you are carrying the entire
weight of those stunning **simians**, but when you roll the barrel
up the inclined plane, a big part of the weight is now supported
by the plane (and not you). That’s the _mechanical advantage_ of
the inclined plane—it helps you accomplish a task _indirectly_ (by
rolling the barrel instead of lifting it) and with less effort.











You probably encounter inclined planes all the time. A
winding trail up a mountain is an inclined plane. So is a wheelchair ramp. The inclined plane is a tool that has been around a
long, long time. Archaeologists tell us that humans were using
inclined planes to move things way back in prehistoric times.
The ancient Egyptians hauled stones to build the pyramids by


60 Simple Machine | Eureka! Files


sliding them up inclined planes. And just the other day, some
desperate TV producers used an inclined plane to roll a barrel
of monkeys into a truck. For _Eureka!_ ’s sake, I hope those **pri-**
**mates** aren’t ready for prime time.

## The Lever

We don’t know who made the first lever, but the ancient Greek
scientist Archimedes figured out the math of how levers work. He
once said, “Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to
place it, and I shall move the world.” He understood the power of a
lever (and a fulcrum), a small force can lift up a massive object.

A lever consists of a beam and a _fulcrum_, which is the hinge
or support that the beam rests on. The object lifted by the lever
is called the _load_, and the work that you put in to operate the
lever is called the _effort_ . Like all the simple machines, the lever
provides a mechanical advantage allowing you to do more with
less effort. The size of the mechanical advantage depends on the
location of the fulcrum. The closer the fulcrum is to the load,
the easier it is to lift the load by pushing down on the other side
of the lever. A playground seesaw is one example of a lever.

Now, suppose Professor Carver hears that Mr. Edison is
interested in planting a garden. The professor is thrilled to share
his passion for agriculture with his friend, so he brings Mr. Edison a gift to help him get started: a two-hundred-pound bag of
**manure** . Mr. Edison isn’t around, so Professor Carver decides to
leave the bag on Mr. Edison’s dressing room coffee table. Perhaps
the bag is too heavy for the professor to lift onto the table, but
if he manages to get it onto one end of a lever beam and place a
fulcrum near the end of the lever closest to the load (the bag),
he can push down on the other end to lift the manure, and then
just slide it onto the coffee table. The closer the fulcrum is to the
bag of manure, the easier it will be for Professor Carver to lift the
bag. Let’s hope Mr. Edison enjoys his gift!

## The Pulley

Ever opened up the blinds? You’ve used a pulley. Ever flown a
flag up a flagpole? You’ve used a pulley. Ever had a dream where
you were being chased by a tiger? No pulley there, but it happens to the best of us. The important thing to remember is that
a simple pulley is a wheel with a groove in it that is attached to
something sturdy and has a rope running over it. The elevator is
another important invention that makes use of a pulley.

How does it work? Last season Jacques needed to load two
hundred pounds of jellyfish food onto his boat, the _Calypso_ . As
we know now, that was a big mistake, but let’s take a look at how
he did it anyway. First he hoisted the bag onto his shoulder and
tried carrying it up the gangplank, but it was too heavy. Then he
attached a simple pulley to a beam hanging over the edge of the
boat. He tied the jellyfish food to one end of the pulley’s rope and
pulled on the other end. This way he was using his body weight
to help lift the jellyfish food, but the bag was still too heavy.

Don’t worry, though. Jacques knew that by attaching one end
of the pulley’s rope to the beam, and then hanging a second pulley from that rope, he could make a double pulley, which would
give him a mechanical advantage. That means the machine lets
him do more with less effort. Specifically, with a double pulley, a
bag that actually weighs two hundred pounds feels as if it weighs
only one hundred pounds. Unfortunately, that mechanical
advantage almost got _Eureka!_ canceled for good!

## The Screw

The humble screw is everywhere. Hardware stores have
thousands of them. The desk or table you’re sitting at was
probably put together with screws. But don’t take the screw for
granted; it is actually a remarkable simple machine that makes
tough jobs a lot easier. For example, a lid is attached to a water
bottle through a screw.

Just ask Professor Carver. Not surprisingly, he is the only
judge who regularly offers to pitch in to help the _Eureka!_ construction crew build the set. Today the crew is working on a
wooden banner that will hang over the judges’ table. Professor
Carver has generously volunteered to fasten together two planks
of wood that will make up part of the letter _E_ in _Eureka!_

Using a screw and a screwdriver will make the job so easy
that Professor Carver will be able to finish the whole _E_ and
maybe even start on the _U_ during his break (while the other
three judges drink coffee and eat pastries). After all, it doesn’t
take a lot of strength to turn a screw clockwise with a screwdriver, but the screw then converts that circular movement into
a powerful force that drives it through the wood. That’s called
a mechanical advantage. The advantage depends on the space
between the threads, the length, and the width of the screw. If
the threads are close together, it will be easy to turn, but will
take more turns. If the space between the threads is wider, it will
take more effort to turn, but take fewer turns.

A final word: one of your esteemed judges should thank his
lucky stars for this simple machine. We won’t name names, but
how many inventors does it take to screw in a light bulb?

## The Wedge

A wedge is a piece of material (usually hard) with two sloping
sides that meet to form an edge (usually sharp). Pound a wedge
into something hard enough, and it will split that something
apart. The blade of an ax is a good example of a wedge. The two
large sides of the blade slope diagonally toward each other until
they meet to form the sharp edge.

Like all the simple machines, the wedge offers a mechanical
advantage. In other words, it takes whatever effort you put into a
task and provides an output that is greater. Imagine, for example,
that you are a lumberjack splitting a tree stump with an ax. The
wedge shape of the blade turns the force of your swing into an
even stronger force once the blade makes contact with the stump.

You can find wedges all over. The pointed ends of a fork are
wedges. The slider you pull down to unzip your jacket is a wedge
that splits apart the “teeth” of the zipper. And speaking of teeth,
you have about ten wedges with you at all times—built right into
you, as a matter of fact. Feel the upper and lower teeth near the
front of your mouth. (Ms. Lamarr hopes your hands were clean.
Otherwise, “Yuck.”) Your teeth start out thick near your gums,
and then narrow to a sharp edge. Those tiny personal mouth
wedges work the same way as an ax blade. The force of your bite
causes the sharp edges of your teeth to split apart that delicious
Brussels sprout.


68 Simple Machine | Eureka! Files


Humans were using wedges to split things way back in the
**Stone Age**, which makes the wedge one of the first inventions
ever. Wedges helped early humans cut wood for fire, hunt (the
sharp ends of spears and arrows are wedges), and grow food
(the blade of a plow, a very important farming tool, is a wedge).
Think about that as you’re brushing your mouth wedges tonight.





Eureka! Files | Simple Machine 69


## The Wheel and Axle

When you finally have all those invention wedges you’re
competing for, they are going to form a wheel. Join a wheel with
an axle and you’re looking at a simple machine that has been a
building block for many other machines.

You might think of the wheel as an invention mainly
connected with transportation. But wheels can be used for
a lot more than moving things from place to place. Attach a
long, thin cylinder (an axle) to a wheel and you’ve got a simple machine that offers a mechanical advantage, helping you
accomplish more with less effort. For instance, imagine pulling
a bucket full of water up from an old-fashioned well. The bucket
hangs from a **cylinder** (the axle) that you turn with a crank
(the wheel). You could try raising the bucket by pulling the
rope directly or by turning the axle by hand, but either of those
methods would require more effort than hoisting the bucket by
turning the crank (the wheel).

When Jacques steers his boat, the _Calypso_, he’s using a wheel
and axle, too. Boats change direction when the rudder, a flat
plank attached to the back of a boat, moves left or right. But at
sea, a boat’s rudder is under water, which means moving it by
hand would be a very hard (and wet) job. The wheel and axle
make the job easy. A boat’s steering wheel (which sailors just
call the wheel) is attached to an axle, which is connected by rope
to the rudder. With very little effort, Jacques can turn the wheel
of his boat, which turns the axle. Then the axle does the hard
work of moving the rudder left or right. Let’s hope he steers
clear of jellyfish.

a communication system he’d invented for soldiers on the battlefield. Night writing was a complicated code of dots pressed into
paper. And I do mean complicated! The system was so hard to
learn that the army gave up on it. But it got me thinking … what
if there were an alphabet for the blind that could easily be read
but didn’t have to be written in extra-large letters? And what if
blind people could also write in this alphabet without using big,
clunky machines?

Transforming night writing into this new alphabet became
my mission, and by age fifteen I had done it. In my new system,
each letter was represented by a simple arrangement of tiny
raised dots. Just as I hoped, my invention allowed full-length
books for the blind to be lighter and smaller, so they were much
easier to print. And even more importantly, my alphabet was
very easy to read by touch, and also gave the blind a practical
way to write using only a simple **stylus** . In the years that followed, I added to my invention so that blind people could read
and write music and mathematical equations. The _Braille alpha-_
_bet_ caught on, and Braille books have been published all over
the world. _**Quelle merveille**_ ! It is incredible, don’t you agree?

## Bette Nesmith Graham



Howdy, guys and gals. And thank you all so much for the
chance to appear on the program. I’m afraid my invention may
seem a little old-fashioned today, but in the 1950s it was **rev-**
**olutionary** . Back then I worked as a secretary at a big bank in
Dallas, Texas—which also happens to be the town where I was
born on March 23, 1924. Of course, we didn’t have computers
and printers in those days. All our letters and business documents were typed on typewriters. You’ve seen typewriters,
haven’t you? Oh gosh, maybe not—you’re all so young! Anyway,
we had the darndest time if we typed even one letter wrong. A
pencil eraser doesn’t work on typewriter ink. No eraser does—
believe me, I tried lots of them. The **upshot** was, if you made a
mistake, you had to go back to the beginning and start again.
Can you imagine?




**-**







Then, one December, I was painting holiday snowflakes
on the bank windows when it suddenly hit me. Painters don’t
erase their mistakes; they paint over them. Maybe the same idea
would work for fixing typing mistakes! So I mixed up a batch of
quick-drying paint that matched the color of the bank’s typing
paper, and put it in a bottle with a tiny little paintbrush. The
next day at work, when I made a mistake in my typing, I just
painted over the wrong letters and then typed the correct ones


were asking for my magical Mistake-Out. A chemistry teacher
at the local high school helped me improve the formula, and
all of a sudden I was selling my invention—now called Liquid
Paper—all over the world. I ran my own company, bringing a
rarely seen feminine touch to the business world: for instance,
it was almost unheard of in the 1970s for a company to have
a child care center, as mine did. I was unstoppable and one of
the most successful women in business (My company sold for
nearly fifty million dollars in 1979!). So you little pups should
really keep your eyes open for problems to solve, and keep your
minds open for all kinds of different ways to solve them. You
never know what you’ll think up!

## Alexander Fleming

Hello and good day to you, student inventors! It’s a pleasure to be on the show. My name is Alexander Fleming—well,
Sir Alexander Fleming, as of the day I was knighted by King
George VI in 1944. But I’m getting ahead of myself. I was born
on August 6, 1881, on a farm in Ayrshire, Scotland. But I wasn’t
meant for farm life. I moved to London as a young man and
became a **bacteriologist** —a scientist who conducts experiments
on bacteria. During World War I, I served as a captain in the
Royal Army Medical Corps. There I saw too many men die
needlessly in field hospitals, where I suspected the **antiseptics**
used to clean their infected wounds were more dangerous than
the wounds themselves. But no one **heeded** my warnings and
the antiseptics continued to be used—it was, to say the least, a
frustrating time for me.

After the war I was busy at St Mary’s Hospital in London,
studying a particularly nasty bacterium called staphylococcus that causes **boils**, **abscesses**, and sore throats. I had a very
good reputation amongst those studying bacteria, though I
was known to be a little sloppy—OK, very sloppy—in my lab.
I admit it: being orderly isn’t my strength. You can’t imagine
the trouble this got me into growing up on the farm—I mean,


do you know how angry a cow gets when you forget to milk
her? But I **digress** . On September 3, 1928, I returned from a
lengthy family holiday to find that I’d left a stack of **petri dishes**
filled with live bacteria **cultures** sitting out on a bench (needless to say, this is not where cultures ought to be left, even for a
night or two!). Unsurprisingly, one of the cultures had become
**contaminated** —invaded—by a fungus, a kind of mold. But
surprisingly, the fungus seemed to be preventing the bacteria
from growing around it. This was curious. So I decided to grow
the fungus, which I called penicillin, again, and realized that it
successfully killed bacteria!

This was great, but I still didn’t comprehend the huge import
of what I’d discovered. What can I say? We can’t always see
precisely what we have when we have it. After all, I tested penicillin for a number of years, but came to the conclusion that it
couldn’t survive long enough within the human body to fight
infection successfully, and I moved on. Luckily, other scientists
stuck with it. By the end of World War II, penicillin was saving
many soldiers’ lives. And shortly thereafter I became Sir Alexander Fleming and shared the Nobel Prize in medicine. Penicillin
was the first **antibiotic** and it unquestionably changed the
world. It is widely considered one of the most important inventions of the twentieth century. The moral of the story? I think
I’d put it something like this: “One sometimes finds what one
is not looking for. When I woke up just after dawn on [that day
in September, 1928], I certainly didn’t plan to revolutionize all
medicine by discovering the world’s first antibiotic, or bacteria
killer. But I guess that was exactly what I did.”
