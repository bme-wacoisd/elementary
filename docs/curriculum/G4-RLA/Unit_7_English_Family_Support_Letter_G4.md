# **Welcome!**
#### **Grade 4, Unit 7**
## **Poetry: Wondrous Words**

Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will be given tools and strategies to approach poetry.

### **What’s the story?**

Students will explore the **methods** and **devices** used by **poets**, which will prepare them to **read** and
**interpret** both **formal and free verse poems** . The poems they will read represent a wide variety of
periods and can be enjoyed by younger and older readers alike.

### **What will my student learn?**

Students will learn to read texts **carefully** . Because poems are often multidimensional, students will
have opportunities to let their imagination flourish, **explore figurative language**, and **expand** their
**creativity** .

Students will use a **Poet’s Journal**, which has been created to reinforce the unit’s **integration of**
**reading and writing poetry** . The poems and activity pages in this journal will allow students to
**review** material, **answer** questions, and **complete activities** designed to increase their
comprehension. Students will also use these pages to **compose original texts** and apply what they
have learned throughout the unit.
