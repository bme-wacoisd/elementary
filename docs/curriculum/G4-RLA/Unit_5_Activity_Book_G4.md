**DATE:**


**Core Connections Vignette**

**Scene I: European Explorers and the “New World”**

**Characters** : Narrators (4), Timeline Tracker, Audience Member, English Royal, English Explorer,
French Royal, French Explorer, Pilgrim Leader


**Narrator 1** : The Age of Exploration occurred from around the 1400s to the 1600s. Ships

left busy ports of Spain, Portugal, France, Holland, and England to sail around the

world. The explorers aboard these ships sought more than adventure. European kings

and queens paid them to find gold, spices . . . and land. And many explorers came as a

way to worship God.


**Timeline Tracker** : [Point out “Age of Exploration” on the Core Connections Timeline on

display.]


**Audience Member** : That’s when Christopher Columbus discovered America, right?


**Narrator 2** : That’s right. In 1492, Columbus claimed land in the Americas for the king

and queen of Spain. After that, many other Europeans followed, curious about what this

“New World” had to offer.


**Timeline Tracker** : [Point out “Christopher Columbus” on the Core Connections

Timeline.]


**Narrator 3** : In the mid-1500s, both the English and the French began to form colonies

in the “New World.” In 1607, the English established their first permanent colony in

Jamestown, Virginia. And in 1620, Plymouth Colony was established by a group of

religious Pilgrims in Massachusetts.


**Narrator 1** : After that—as they say—the rest is history!


**Timeline Tracker** : [Point out “Jamestown” on the Core Connections Timeline.]


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **1**


**Narrator 4** : Imagine now that you live during the early 1600s. Listen as first the king (or

queen) of England and then the king (or queen) of France each talk to an explorer about

traveling to the “New World.” Both countries are anxious to claim more land in North

America.


**Narrator 1** : First, the English.


**English Royal** : Spain keeps claiming more and more territory across the Atlantic Ocean.

We need to get over there and take a share—a LARGE share—for our homeland!


**English Explorer** : Well, sir (ma’am), it seems Spain has already claimed most of the

territory in Central and South America. No worries, though, we will get as much of the

remaining land as we can!


[English Royal and English Explorer sit down.]


**Narrator 1** : Now, the French.


**French Royal** : We, too, shall sail to this “New World” and get as much land and riches as

we can for France.


**French Explorer** : Yes, your majesty!


**Narrator 2:** The Age of Exploration also included those seeking a place to worship God.

Listen to an English Pilgrim leader talk to fellow religious believers who are looking to

the New World as a place of freedom.


**Pilgrim Leader:** The King of England is standing against us. We are not able to worship

as we believe. He will put us in jail unless we change our beliefs. We will sail to create a

New England. We will be free to worship the Lord and keep his commandments.

**Scene II: Native American Alliances**

**Characters** : Narrators (4), Timeline Tracker, Native Americans (2), English Explorer, French
Explorer


**Narrator 1** : At about the same time that English colonists settled Jamestown and Pilgrims

settled Plymouth, French colonists arrived in New France and settled Québec.


**Timeline Tracker** : [Point out “Québec” on the Core Connections Timeline.]


**Narrator 2** : Many of these French and English explorers encountered Native American

tribes already living on the land, just as Christopher Columbus had more than 100 years

earlier.


**Narrator 3** : Listen as two Native Americans encounter European explorers for the

first time.


**Native American 1** : Did they say “New World”?


**Native American 2** : What “New World”?


**Native American 1** : Who are these people?


**Native American 2** : And what do they want?


**Narrator 3** : There were many different Native Americans tribes, some trading with one

another, some fighting one another, and some forming alliances with other tribes, both

to trade and to wage war. Now, they had decide what to do with these new “tribes,” the

Europeans.


**English Explorer (to Native American 1)** : We will trade knives, glass, copper, and brass in

exchange for meat, fish, animal skins, and furs.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **3**


**French Explorer (to Native American 2)** : We will teach you how to hunt with metal

weapons if you will teach us to hunt in the wilderness.


**Narrator 4** : For many years, Europeans traded goods with Native Americans. Over time,

some tribes formed alliances with the English and others formed alliances with the

French.

**Scene III: Competing for the Same Land**

**Characters** : Narrators (2), Map Guide, British General, French General, French (all students)


**Narrator 1** : Explorers from many European countries raced to claim areas of North

America for themselves. The English crown and English religious pilgrims established

colonies along the east coast of North America—between Spanish settlements to the

south and French settlements to the north.


**Map Guide** : [Point out the English colonies as well as the areas north and south of the

colonies on the Colonial North America Map.]


**Narrator 2** : By 1733, the British had established 13 colonies in America, the last one being

Georgia in 1733. But British colonists prospered, with large families growing up in

America and more settlers coming from Britain. As their numbers continued to grow,

they pushed westward, across the Appalachian Mountains to an area already occupied

by the French—the Ohio River Valley.


**British General** : We need more land so more of our families can build homes. We have

been blessed. This rich river valley is a true land of opportunity.


**French General** : The French established forts and trading posts here long before the

British ever crossed the mountains. Everyone knows this land is called New France.


**Narrator 1** : This was not a good combination! The British and the French had been

enemies for years on the other side of the ocean. Now, they were competing for the same

land in North America. Listen as French and British generals justify their claim to the

same land.


**British General** : [clearing throat] Ahem. It is a well-known fact that the land belongs to

Great Britain. The members of the British Parliament even wrote to tell the French to

leave at once.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **5**


**Narrator 2** : Hmm. This was a bad sign! [to audience] Do you think the French will

cooperate with this request?


**French (ALL)** : [pausing as if to consider this request before replying in unison] _Non!_


**Narrator 1** : The British prepared to defend the land. And so did the French. It seemed

conflict was unavoidable.

**Scene IV: A Long, Long War**

**Characters** : Narrators (4), Audience Members (2), Timeline Tracker


**Narrator 1** : And so it was that fighting began between the British and the French, both

wanting to control land west of the Appalachian Mountains, the Ohio River Valley.


**Narrator 2** : Both sides knew they could not defeat the other without the help of Native

Americans. Similar to the British on the coast, the French established trading partners

with Native American allies too.


**Narrator 3** : The British made trading partners with Native American allies, too.


**Narrator 4:** Different Native American tribes had been allies with each other, and waged

war with other tribes for centuries. Now, they would be joining in a fight between

Britain and France.


**Narrator 1** : So both Britain and France received help from different Native American

tribes when the fighting began.


**Narrator 2** : Eventually, Britain officially declared war on France in 1756. But the British

and French colonists had already been fighting for two years in the wilderness of North

America. The French and Indian War was well underway.


**Audience Member 1** : Wait! The French and Indian War? Why isn’t it called the French

and British War?


**Narrator 3** : Excellent question. The war is known as the French and Indian War because

the British fought against the French and their Native American, or Indian, allies.


**Narrator 1** : That’s right. The French and Indian War was not a war between the French

and the Indians. It was between the French and the British—part of their ongoing

struggle for control of land in other parts of the world.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **7**


**Audience Member 2** : So, fighting was going on in other parts of the world at the same

time?


**Narrator 2** : Yes, the French and Indian War was just part of more fighting involving many

countries, particularly the French and the British, around the world.


**Narrator 3** : Fighting continued in the wilderness of North America for a very long time—

almost nine years in all.


**Narrator 1** : Yes, and that was only the beginning. Even though Great Britain became the

dominant power in North America after the war, life in the British colonies was never

the same.


**Narrator 2** : But that’s a lesson for another day.

**Sequencing Events**

_Sequence the following events from first to last. The first event, the French and Indian War,_
_is already labeled. Number the remaining events 2–5._


Parliament passed the Stamp Act, taxing colonists to raise money for Great
Britain.


Great Britain was left with enormous debts after the war and needed additional
funds to maintain the new lands it acquired from France.


The British fought and defeated the French in the French and Indian War to gain
control of land in North America.


The colonists protested the Stamp Act with meetings, pamphlets, and petitions to
London.


The colonists felt the Stamp Act was unfair because they had no representation in
the British Parliament where the laws were made.

**From “Paul Revere’s Ride”**

**Henry Wadsworth Longfellow**

**Written in 1860**



Listen, my children, and you shall hear

Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,

On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-Five;

Hardly a man is now alive

Who remembers that famous day and year.


He said to his friend, “If the British march

By land or sea from the town to-night,

Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch

Of the North-Church-tower, as a signal-light, —

One if by land, and two if by sea;

And I on the opposite shore will be,

Ready to ride and spread the alarm

Through every Middlesex village and farm,

For the country-folk to be up and to arm.


Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,

Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride,

On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.

Now he patted his horse’s side,

Now gazed on the landscape far and near,

Then impetuous stamped the earth,

And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;

But mostly he watched with eager search

The belfry-tower of the old North Church,

As it rose above the graves on the hill,

Lonely and spectral and somber and still.

And lo! as he looks, on the belfry’s height,

A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!

He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,

But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight

A second lamp in the belfry burns!

**DATE:**


**Vignette I**

**Characters** : Narrator, Members of Parliament (5), Members of Sons of Liberty (8), Paul Revere


**Narrator** : The year is 1766 and the British colonies of North America are unhappy

with what they consider to be unfair taxes levied on them by Great Britain. Listen as

members of the British Parliament discuss what to do about these angry colonists.


**Great Britain 1766**


**Member of Parliament 1** : The colonists are not calming down. They continue to protest

the Stamp Act and boycott British goods. I am told they may rebel if we don’t do

something soon.


**Member of Parliament 2** : Can the Stamp Act be repealed to quiet them down?


**Member of Parliament 3** : It can. However, we still need to collect taxes to cover the debts

from the French and Indian War and pay to maintain our newly acquired land.


**Member of Parliament 4** : Perhaps we could repeal the Stamp Act and impose a new tax,

such as a tax on tea. The colonists might be so pleased to have the Stamp Act gone that

they won’t worry about new taxes.


**Member of Parliament 5** : A brilliant solution! We need to keep the peace with the British

colonists, but we also have to pay off Great Britain’s debts. Let us repeal the Stamp Act

and pass another act as quickly as possible to tax the colonists on other goods. If they do

not have to buy stamps, they may not even be aware of being taxed.


**Narrator** : The British Parliament voted to repeal the Stamp Act in March of 1766, only

one year after the Stamp Act was passed. But, four years later, the colonists are still

unhappy. Listen to find out why.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **55**


**Four Years Later: Colonies 1770**


**Member of Sons of Liberty 1** : King George and his Parliament must think we are fools!

Nothing has changed! They merely replace one tax with another! These taxes are

imposed on us by a far-away government.


**Member of Sons of Liberty 2** : We have been able to raise our own taxes in the past. Have

they lost faith in our ability to govern ourselves?”


**Member of Sons of Liberty 3** : Whatever their reason, it is not fair. We deserve a voice in

how to raise the money.


**Member of Sons of Liberty 4** : The British Parliament thinks we are weak. We cannot

tolerate unfair taxes that are set by a ruler who is across the ocean.


**Member of Sons of Liberty 5** : Yes, and look where it has led—a massacre in the streets of

Boston! We must stand up for those who died.


**Three Years Later: Colonies 1773**


**Narrator** : The year is 1773, three years after the Boston Massacre, and the colonists still

feel unheard by Great Britain. Listen as Paul Revere discusses what action to take next

with his fellow members of the Sons of Liberty.


**Paul Revere** : We are no better off than we were three years ago! It is true that Parliament

repealed some taxes after the Boston Massacre, but the tax on tea remains.


**Member of Sons of Liberty 6** : It’s not too late. We need to send Parliament a message and

show them we are strong.

to drink tea. Think how much money Great Britain will lose if the contents of more than

300 chests of tea sink to the bottom of the bay.


**Member of Sons of Liberty 8** : Agreed. It’s time to do something! No more taxation

without representation!


**Continued chanting by all members of Sons of Liberty** : No taxation without

representation!

**Characters** : Narrator, King George III, Members of Parliament (4), Patrick Henry,
Representatives from Virginia (2)


**Narrator** : In December of 1773, the Sons of Liberty dumped chests full of tea in Boston

Harbor. Listen to discover how King George III reacted when he received word of the

Boston Tea Party. In this scene, the king discusses the event with members of the British

Parliament.


**British Parliament, Great Britain 1774**


**King George III** : This is an outrage! Dumping 340 chests of tea into Boston Harbor is just

foolishness! They thought the taxes were bad? Now they will have to repay Great Britain

for the tea they dumped.


**Member of Parliament 1** : We can send British ships and keep the harbor closed until the

colonists pay for the cost of the tea they threw away. No ships will be able to enter or

leave the harbor.


**King George III** : Yes. And closing the harbor will not be all. Boston must be reminded

that they are British subjects. They live with protection and privileges provided by Great

Britain, and they will live with the laws of their king.


**Member of Parliament 2** : What other laws do you propose, Your Majesty?


**King George III** : The colonists are taking too many liberties. I want stricter control of

their meetings and how they elect officials. I or my minsters will decide who holds

important government positions in Massachusetts.


**Member of Parliament 3** : I quite agree. There should also be new rules for trials.

Bostonians should be tried by the king’s judges outside of Boston.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **79**


**Member of Parliament 4** : It would also relieve the burden and expense on Great Britain if

the colonists provided food and shelter for British soldiers.


**King George III** : Agreed. Make it so, and send more soldiers to Boston. I have a feeling we

may need them there.


**Narrator** : Parliament passes a series of acts, known as the Intolerable Acts, during 1774.

Word spreads, raising debates throughout the colonies. Should the colonists obey the

laws of a far-away government or break away from Great Britain altogether? Listen as

Patrick Henry declares his views before a group of representatives in Virginia.


**Richmond, Virginia 1775**


**Patrick Henry** : Gentlemen, I attended the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia last

year, as did some of you. We agreed that Parliament’s new laws are indeed intolerable.

These laws show that King George is not going to allow any colonists the independence

we desire and have had in the past.


**Virginia Representative 1** : But Mr. Henry, King George knows he must repeal the

Intolerable Acts or we will stop exporting goods to Great Britain.


**Patrick Henry** : The king shows no sign of hearing our complaints and grievances. Mere

words are not enough. We need to take action.


**Virginia Representative 2** : What are you suggesting, Mr. Henry? Do you believe that war

is unavoidable?


**Patrick Henry** : Gentlemen may cry, “Peace! Peace!” But there is no peace. The war is

actually begun! . . . I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me

liberty or give me death!

**Narrator** : Patrick Henry’s cry for liberty rang out through the colonies, and many people

agreed with him that war was unavoidable and the time had come for the colonies

to arm themselves. Listen to King George’s reaction to news from his soldiers in

Massachusetts that the colonists are preparing to fight.


**Great Britain, Early April 1775**


**Member of Parliament 1** : Your Majesty, word has come that the colonists are organizing

militias, stockpiling guns, and preparing to fight.


**King George III** : Then the soldiers we have in Boston will not be enough. It is time to

send an army. Are the Sons of Liberty still leading this revolt?


**Member of Parliament 2** : There is support trickling throughout the colonies; but, yes, the

Sons of Liberty are still at the heart of things in Boston. Word has it Samuel Adams and

John Hancock are two of the biggest troublemakers.


**King George III** : Tell my army to confiscate any weapons they can find and arrest Samuel

Adams and John Hancock.


**Narrator** : Tensions had been high in and around Boston for many years now. Constant

clashes between British soldiers and colonists finally came to a head in the nearby towns

of Lexington and Concord. Listen as Samuel Adams and John Hancock discuss the

events of April 19, 1775, and what it means for the future.

Boston in Concord.


**John Hancock** : Well, they found the weapons, but not how they had hoped!


**Samuel Adams** : Ha, that’s right! Little did they know that Paul Revere and other riders

had a plan to warn people when the British army marched out of Boston.


**John Hancock** : We all owe those men a great debt, for we were able to be ready to stand

our ground in Lexington and prepare to fight as the army marched to Concord and

back.


**Samuel Adams** : The British army was smaller when it got back to Boston than when it

left. But we lost many men, too.

**Excerpt from “Rip Van Winkle”**

_Read the following excerpt from the Reader and complete the activity that follows._


One day, seeking to escape the hard work of the farm and the complaints of

his wife, Rip grabbed his gun and walked into the Catskill Mountains to hunt for

squirrels. All day the mountains echoed with the sound of shots fired from his gun.

Finally, he sat down on a little green hill that looked down into the valley below. Rip

admired the scene as evening gradually advanced and sighed as he thought about the

journey home.


As he was about to descend, he heard a voice calling, “Rip Van Winkle! Rip

Van Winkle!” He caught sight of a strange figure climbing up the rocks, carrying

something on its back. Rip was surprised to see any human being in this lonely place,

but he concluded that it must be one of his neighbors in need of assistance. Rip

hurried down to help. The stranger was a short old fellow with a grizzled beard. His

clothes were old-fashioned. He made signs for Rip to assist him, and together they

clambered up a narrow gully. Every now and then long rolling **peals** like thunder

seemed to issue out of a deep ravine. Passing through this ravine, they came to a

hollow.


In the center was a company of odd-looking persons playing at **ninepins** . The

thunderous noise Rip had heard from afar was the sound of the ball rolling toward

the pins. Like Rip’s guide, they were dressed in an outlandish fashion, with enormous

**breeches** . What seemed particularly odd to Rip was that these folks looked very

serious indeed. They played without speaking and were, in fact, the most **melancholy**

party he had ever witnessed. They stared at Rip in such a way that his heart turned

within him and his knees banged together.

Rip and his guide joined the party. Before long, the events of the day and the

**Benjamin Franklin and the Revolutionary War**


1 You could say Benjamin Franklin played an important role in the American
Revolution. However, it would be more accurate to say Franklin played several
important roles.


2 Before discussing Franklin’s roles in the Revolutionary War, it is necessary to describe
something important Franklin did long before the Revolution. Back in the 1750s,
during the French and Indian War, it seems Franklin created and printed a popular
cartoon, which showed a snake divided into several sections. The tail was labeled S.C.,
for South Carolina. One of the middle sections was labeled N.J., for New Jersey. The
head was labeled N.E., for New England. Underneath the snake Franklin printed the
words “JOIN, or DIE.” What was he trying to say? It’s likely he was trying to say that if
the colonies joined together to fight against the French, they would be much stronger.
And if they did not join together, the French would defeat them. Franklin was urging
the colonies to join together against a common enemy.


3 The colonies did eventually join together during the French and Indian War. With
help from the British, as well as their own Native American allies, the colonists were
able to defeat the French. However, when the British government tried to pay for
the war with new taxes, another crisis occurred. This brings us to one of Franklin’s
important roles in the American Revolution—helping to oppose the Stamp Act.


4 Franklin was in England in 1765, when Parliament was voting on the Stamp Act.
He was serving as a diplomat representing the Pennsylvania Assembly. His job was
to represent the colony and try to protect the colonists’ interests. Franklin opposed
the Stamp Act and tried to convince members of Parliament to vote against it. Even
though Franklin argued against the Stamp Act, Parliament approved it.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **147**


5 The colonists at home protested against the Stamp Act. The Stamp Act was a tax on all
paper items. Many people refused to buy these items, therefore refusing to pay the tax.
These protesters thought it was important for all colonies to join together and oppose
the tax.


6 Some protesters remembered the cartoon Franklin had created 10 years earlier—the
one with snake parts. They felt this cartoon was perfect for the current situation.
Once again, the colonies had to join together against a common enemy. This time,
the common enemy was not the French. It was Parliament and the king’s ministers.
Franklin’s cartoon was reprinted in many colonial newspapers.


7 The colonists’ reaction to the Stamp Act surprised the king and his government.
Franklin was called to speak in the Houses of Parliament. He tried to persuade
Parliament to remove the Stamp Act by explaining why the colonists were so upset
about the new law, and his remarks helped convince Parliament to repeal the act.
Helping convince Parliament to repeal the Stamp Act was another one of Franklin’s
important roles in the American Revolution.


8 Many colonists were pleased with Franklin because he had opposed the Stamp Act.
Several other colonies decided to make him their representative in London. He not
only served as a representative for Pennsylvania, he also represented Massachusetts,
New Jersey, and Georgia.


9 In 1774, Franklin met with several top British ministers. They believed Franklin was
being disloyal to them and unsupportive of their views. By this time, Franklin was
getting very frustrated with King George III and Parliament. It seemed to him the
king and Parliament were not listening to the colonists’ concerns or caring about their
needs. Franklin felt the colonists would have no choice but to break away and declare
independence. Despite Franklin’s frustration, he still had some hope that the British
and colonies would come to an agreement. However, a few months later, he decided it
was time to return home to help the patriots—a cause he now firmly supported.

**A Fictional Excerpt from a Boy’s Diary, Written in New York City,**
**New York—July 11, 1776**


1 Yesterday was a day I will never forget. I got up early and ran to Dickie’s house. Then
the two of us went out to see the soldiers from Connecticut march into town. Dickie
thought there were about 400 soldiers.


2 After lunch, they called out each of the colonial regiments, and they all lined up in
formation. Then they read the Declaration of Independence aloud. There were so
many people there that we couldn’t see General Washington. In fact, we couldn’t see
much of anything, but we could hear some of the words. And what fine words they
were! Dickie and I liked the part that began, “We hold these truths to be
self-evident . . .” because it sounded so eloquent and poetic. The last part of it was a bit
less exciting, though. It listed many complaints against King George: _he has raised our_
_taxes, he has quartered troops in our cities, he has_ —The list seemed to go on forever.


3 Dickie whispered, “This long list makes it clear that while King George may be a good
king for the British, he is not a good king for the colonists.”


4 When they finished reading the list, the soldiers fired a salute and everybody cheered.
It was so exciting that I was sad when I had to go home for supper. However, it turned
out my day was not over yet.


5 Later that night, while I was lying in bed, I heard a noise that sounded like a bird
call. The sound seemed to be coming from right outside our front door, and it kept
repeating. Somehow, I didn’t think it was a bird.


6 I got out of bed and tiptoed over to the door. Then I made the same bird call. There
was a short pause before I heard a voice whisper, “Come outside!”


7 It was Dickie!


8 I tiptoed over to look at Papa, and he was snoring loudly. Mama was sleeping, too, so I
slipped on my breeches and tiptoed out.

9 “You won’t believe it!” Dickie said. “They are tearing down the statue!”


10 “Which one?” I asked.


11 “The statue of the king in the Bowling Green Park!” Dickie said.


12 We ducked over to Broadway and then ran as fast as we could all the way down to
Bowling Green. There stood the statue of King George III—the one that shows him
dressed up like a Roman general riding on a horse.


13 A noisy crowd of people had gathered and most of them were men. Some of them
were men I knew, men who were proud to call themselves Sons of Liberty. Others
were men I had never seen before. They were shouting and yelling and singing
patriotic songs. There were bonfires burning, and some men were pulling on ropes,
trying to pull the statue down.


14 It took a lot of tugging, but eventually the statue tipped over and came crashing down.
A great roar rose from the crowd.


15 Then a soldier with red hair jumped up on the statue and made a speech. “Good
people!” he shouted. “Noble patriots and lovers of your country, I am a humble soldier
from the great, independent state of New Jersey.”


16 The crowd applauded loudly for the speaker.


17 “I thank you in advance for the musket balls you have promised to make from this
fallen statue. I assure you that my fellow soldiers and I will use those musket balls for
a good cause.”


18 The crowd applauded loudly again after hearing this.


19 Dickie and I stayed at Bowling Green a while longer before returning home. I
managed to sneak back into bed without Mama or Papa noticing I was gone.


20 When I woke up the next morning, Papa was reading the paper.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **153**


21 He said, “Well, my boy, it’s a good thing we were home in our beds last night! For it
seems that the patriot crowd got a little out of hand. It says here that they tore down
the statue of the king!”


22 “Really?” I said, trying to sound surprised while hiding my smile.

**Passage 1:**
**Colonial America, Part I**


1 Colonial America was a time of change and development. Before there were
Jamestown and Plymouth, the land that is now known as the United States was home
to diverse Native American cultures and communities. The arrival of explorers from
the Eastern world in 1492 brought changes to what we know as the United States.


**The Voyage to Virginia**


2 In 1606, the British king told a group to travel across the Atlantic Ocean. Their job
was to create a colony. The colony was still a part of Britain, even though it was far
away. The king hoped the colonies would help British trade. At the time, he thought
they might find gold or silver there. He also wanted to explore the area for new routes
to Asia. This would have helped trade too.


3 In 1607, the group landed. They made the colony of Virginia. People kept settling
there. Anyone who moved there was given the same rights they had in Britain.


4 The first year in Virginia was brutal. The colonists would not have survived without
trade with the Native Americans. But their relationship was not always peaceful.
There were many times that it was rough. It took a few years for the colonists and
Native Americans to make peace.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **163**


**The Pilgrims Set Sail**


5 Have you heard of the Pilgrims? Well, around this same time, there was a group called
the Pilgrims. The Pilgrims wanted to move across the Atlantic Ocean. One group
offered to pay for their trip on a ship called the Mayflower. In return, the Pilgrims
gave them money for seven years.


6 On the way to their new home, the men signed the _Mayflower Compac_ t. It set rules
that they all agreed to live by. The rules were meant to keep order. They arrived in
1620. But instead of landing near Virgina, they were much farther north. They landed
in what is now Massachusetts! Within ten years, their colony was doing well. By the
1630s, their city of Boston was thriving.


**The American Colonies**


7 The English colonies came to be known as the American colonies. The time from
1492 to 1763 is often called Colonial America. Each colony had a unique story. Yet
three groups of colonies grew similarly.


8 The New England Colonies had long and cold winters. Farming could only take place
during a few months of the year. So people learned other jobs. As a result, large cities
formed for trade. One example is Boston, Massachusetts.


9 The Middle Colonies had fertile soil and a lot of wood. As a result, jobs that used
wood, like building ships, grew. With easier ways to move farm goods by boat, trade
increased.


10 The Southern Colonies had the perfect climate for year-round farming. At first, a few
crops were grown to make cash. Later, cotton became the major crop. A lot of workers
were needed to grow these crops. As a result, most enslaved people were moved to the
South for farming.

**People of the Colonies**


11 People who first arrived in the colonies were often sick. They also lived through many
hardships. To live with the difficulties they faced, most adults married. They also had
many kids. It was common for families to have more than ten people.


12 As families grew, so did the number of people in the colonies. At the same time,
people continued to flee from Europe to the colonies. They did this for many reasons.
A lot of people were looking for freedom. At the same time, many people were
enslaved and forced to work on farms.


13 In the 1600s, most of the people in the colonies were from Britain. However, people
also came from many different places. It took time for them to see themselves as a
unified group. By the 1700s, the word “American” was used to describe people living
in the colonies. The English language became the most spoken language. Many parts
of English culture remained too. By 1780, the number of people living there grew to
almost three million!


1. According to “Colonial America, Part I,” why did the Pilgrims sign the _Mayflower_
_Compact_ ?

A. because they wanted a paid trip to the northeast

B. because they hoped to live in a safe and organized place

C. because they planned for their religion to grow in the colony

D. because they made a pact with the king to help people move there


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **165**


**Passage 2:**
**Colonial America, Part II**


**Roots of Democracy**


14 Do you know who was in charge of the colonies? The British king! He was the top
of the government. He made or approved the rules. He also made sure they were
followed.


15 How could one man be in charge of the colonies that were so far away? He had a
group of people called the council. The council went to Virginia to help the king run
the colony. The council had one big rule to follow: They could not make rules that
went against the king.


16 The council made rules—called “laws”—for the people of Virginia. If someone had
a problem with the law, they could go to court. The council led the court. After a few
years, the council picked a governor to lead them.


17 By 1619, the council changed the way they worked. They created a new government.
The governor was one part of it, and the other part was chosen, or elected, by the
people. Their job was to make laws. This was the first example of democracy in the
colonies. Later, several other colonies also elected members of government.


18 The Pilgrims of Massachusetts created a somewhat different government. In Virginia,
the authority for their government came from a charter written in England. But the
Pilgrims were the first to write down a document defining how they would govern
themselves, the _Mayflower Compact_ . The leaders of the government they established
were chosen by the church. Though they did not have elected leaders, the Pilgrims
cared a lot about liberty. They regularly attended town meetings. In those town
meetings, they talked about problems and solutions.


**Religious Freedom**


19 Do you know why the Pilgrims came to the colonies? They came to America because
they wanted to practice their religion. For years back in England, they were not

allowed to believe what they wanted. The Pilgrims thought that their religion would
keep peace in the colonies. Their plan for peace was to connect their government to
one religion. Anyone who did not practice their religion was forced to leave.


20 Rhode Island was the first colony to allow different religions. Pennsylvania was the
second. By the mid-1700s, the colonies were more accepting of different religions.
The church also had less of a role in government. People with different faiths settled
in New York and the Carolinas. Enslaved people brought African religions to the
colonies too.


21 How did religious freedom impact the government? Over time, the colonists tried to
think of religion and the government as two different groups. The church did not lead
the government. This was very different from Britain, where the king claimed he was
chosen by God to lead the government.


**A More Unified Culture**


22 How did such unique colonies agree on anything? By the middle of the 1700s, the
colonies became more connected. Newspapers were printed throughout the colonies.
Each colony had at least one. By 1765, there were twenty-five newspapers in the
colonies. This helped people in the colonies to debate current events. Pamphlets and
books were also printed to share ideas. This meant the colonies didn’t have to get their
books from Europe. Ideas began in and were shared throughout Colonial America.


23 The colonies also became more connected by building roadways. Traveling from one
colony to another was easier. People began to trade goods more easily. They could also
mail letters through the first post office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Speaking of
Philadelphia, the city became the second-largest city in the British Empire!


24 Did the colonies rely on Europe for their best and brightest? No! American skilled
craftsmen and artists became well-known around the world. Colleges were formed
and trained people in many jobs. With this, the colonists were able to educate their
own lawyers, doctors, teachers, and more.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **167**


**The Roots of Revolution**


25 Is it okay to break a law that does not seem fair? This was a question many people
asked in Colonial America. They did not like the way things were run in the colonies.
Some Americans felt that their lives would be easier if the British king was not their
ruler. Some people broke laws or rules because they were not fair. This became more
common over time.


26 Still, most colonists were loyal to Britain. In 1763, war broke out between the French
and British near the colonies. Many colonists fought as soldiers for Britain.


27 The atmosphere changed after the war. The colonists and the British had different
views about the war. They also had different ideas about government. A series of
events unfolded. These led the colonists to unite for good. They declared their

**Passage 3:**
**Marshfield Dreams, Part I**
_Ralph Fletcher_

**Marshfield**


1 There’s a town called Marshfield in the state of Vermont. You can also find a
Marshfield in Maine, one in Missouri, and one in Wisconsin. I grew up in Marshfield,
Massachusetts. The curly part of Massachusetts that sticks out into the ocean is Cape
Cod. Marshfield sits on the ocean, just above that curl.


2 I lived on Acorn Street in a regular house bordered by forest on two sides. Dad owned
seven acres of woods in back. Across a dirt driveway we had Ale’s Woods, a forest of
pine trees. The pines dropped millions of needles, which gave the forest floor a nice,
springy feel. Those trees were great for climbing. If I crawled out too far on a limb and
fell, the soft needles cushioned my fall, so I never got hurt.


3 The woods held magical things. We found snake skins, real Indian arrowheads, box
turtles, beehives, snake spit on tall grass. We dug up the buried trash from people who
lived there many years before. We saw gravestones so old we could no longer read
the names carved in them. We found all kinds of mushrooms. Some were edible, and
others were poisonous toadstools. Mom said to think of them as strangers—some are
good, some are bad, and since you couldn’t tell the difference it was best to leave them
alone. One morning in the woods I stepped into a fairy ring of mushrooms, a big
circle ten feet across.


4 There was a tiny stream in our backyard small enough so you could step from one
bank to the other. This stream flowed under the dirt driveway and formed a swamp
at the edge of Ale’s Woods. I loved the dank smell of that swamp and all the things
that lived there: mossy logs and goggle-eyed frogs, bloodsuckers and eels and
foul-smelling skunk cabbage. Half the swamp was underwater, and the other half
contained thick, dense mud. It was impossible to walk through that muck without
getting stuck. More than once I tried and left behind one of my sneakers, a lost sole
sunk forever at the bottom of the swamp. I got in trouble for that. But today I’m glad
to know that something of mine was left behind in Marshfield.


5 Here is my story.

Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **171**


**Junior**


6 As the oldest of nine, I was named after my father and my grandfather. Some kids
on Acorn Street teased me, calling: “Hey, Juuuu-nioooor!” not that I minded. I liked
having the same name as my father, but it did cause confusion in the house.


7 Whenever Mom called out, “Ralph!” Dad and I would both answer, “Yeah?”


8 “No, Big Ralph!” or, “Little Ralph!” she yelled back, to clarify things. I guess that
would have annoyed some people, but it didn’t really bother me. Dad was tall and
handsome. I bragged to my friends that my father was so cool he had three jobs:
teacher, milkman, bartender. I was proud of him. I loved knowing that Ralph could fit
us both in one snug syllable.


9 By the time I was three I already had a brother, Jimmy, who was a year younger than
me. My sister Elaine was a year younger than Jim. Dad worked as a traveling book
salesman, and Mom took care of us when Dad was away. Dad came home on Friday
nights. On Saturdays, after breakfast, the whole family would play outside.


10 As soon as I saw Mom and Dad coming out the door, I’d get excited and run to the big
boulder in the front yard. We were about to play my favorite game, Statue. I arranged
my body in a certain pose and froze. Then I closed my eyes, waiting. My heart beat
faster as they came closer.


11 “What’s this?” Dad asked.


12 “It looks like a statue!” Mom said. She had Jimmy and Lainie in the stroller and
pushed them closer.


13 “A statue of a little boy!” Dad exclaimed. “It’s beautiful! It’s absolutely perfect! Amazing!”


14 Mom knelt to touch my nose. I could feel the eyes of my whole family studying me
closely. Jimmy laughed. The baby just stared.


15 “A little boy, carved in stone!” Mom exclaimed. “You think we could buy it?”

16 “Hey, look!” Dad said. “There’s a price tag right here on the sleeve!”


17 I remained absolutely still, barely breathing, while Dad examined the invisible tag.


18 “How much?” Mom asked impatiently. “How much is it?”


19 “It’s a lot—one hundred dollars!” Dad told her. “But who cares? It’s worth every
penny! I’d pay five hundred dollars for a statue like this! I’d pay a thousand!”


20 I tried hard not to smile.


21 “Excuse me, madam,” Dad said to baby Lainie. “Is this your store? My wife and I
would like to buy this statue here. A hundred dollars? Certainly. Here you go. Ten,
twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred. What? Ship it?
No, no thank you. We’ll just put it in our car and drive it home.”


22 He handed Lainie to Mom and picked me up. With me in his lap, stiff as a board, he
sat on the boulder. Mom sat beside him. Dad pretended to turn on the car ignition.


23 “Drive carefully,” Mom said. “We don’t want the statue to get damaged.”


24 “Don’t worry,” Dad replied, while turning the steering wheel. He pretended to park
the car. “Here we are.”


25 “Where should we put the statue?” Mom asked.


26 “I’ve got the perfect place for it,” he said. “Right here in our front yard.”


27 “How wonderful,” Mom exclaimed. “We’ve got two boys, but I’ve always
wanted another.”


28 “Look at the detail on the face.” Dad bent down to examine me closely. “It almost
looks alive!”


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **173**


29 That was my cue. Slowly, I lifted my chin and looked up, first at my father, then at
my mother.


30 “My goodness!” they shouted. “He’s alive!”


31 Hugs! Kisses!


32 “It’s a real boy!” Dad exclaimed. “Would you like to live with us?”


33 Shyly, I nodded. With more hugs and kisses, they welcomed me into the family.


34 “It’s a miracle,” Dad kept saying. “An absolute miracle.”

**Passage 4:**
**Marshfield Dreams, Part II**
_Ralph Fletcher_

**Jimmy**


35 When Jimmy and I were in our bunk beds, we talked about everything. Most of the
time I knew what he was thinking, and he knew my thoughts too.


36 One time, Jimmy led a bunch of kids through a part of Ale’s Woods we’d never
explored before. It was hot, and the rest of us wore shorts, but Jimmy always wore
heavy jeans because he liked to climb through thickets of briars and prickers. His face
was sweaty and streaked with dirt. We’d just entered a sunny meadow, running full
speed, when Jimmy suddenly slammed on the brakes. He pointed at a wooden shack
caved in on one side.


37 “C’mon!” he yelled.


38 Jimmy climbed in. I heard a muffled cry, and then he climbed out again. Everyone
gasped: He was triumphantly holding two fistfuls of snakes! There must have been six
of them in each hand, garter snakes twisting in the sunlight, furious that their sleeping
place had been disturbed.


39 Another time, after a bad windstorm, Jimmy and I went hiking through a swampy
part of the woods. The storm had knocked over a tree, and a shallow pool had formed
in the crater left by the mass of uplifted roots. We went for a closer look, and as I
moved to the water’s edge, something lurched into the water.


40 “Did you see that?” Jimmy asked.


41 “Yeah.” I nodded. “Looked like some kind of newt or salamander.”


42 “That was no ordinary salamander,” Jimmy informed me. “Didn’t you see the red on
its gills?”


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **175**


43 At home Jimmy searched through the World Book Encyclopedia to find the animal
he’d seen. For a long time he sat on the living room floor paging through volumes A
(amphibians), L (lizards), and R (reptiles).


44 “Found it,” he said, showing me the page. “A mud puppy. That’s it. We saw a mud puppy.”


45 Mud puppy! I fell in love with the odd name, the funny picture it made in my head.
The name clicked. Pretty soon all the neighborhood kids were calling that uprooted
tree Mud Puppy Place, although we never did see any mud puppies after that day in
the woods.


**School**


46 It was time for me to start first grade. Jimmy stood with me at the bus stop. Mom
waited with us.


47 “What are you going to do in school?” Jimmy asked, frowning.


48 “I don’t know,” I said. “Learn stuff.”


49 “Why can’t I come too?”


50 “You’re not old enough,” I told him.


51 “Next year,” Mom said.


52 Jimmy kicked a stone across the street. Finally, the bus rumbled up, huge and yellow.
It opened its doors; Jimmy stepped back as I climbed the stairs. I found a seat next to
my friend Steve Fishman and waved through the window. Mom waved and flashed a
big smile, but my brother kept both hands at his sides.

53 I liked school. And on that first day I knew I’d be good at it. I could just tell. I was
good at figuring out what the teacher wanted me to do and exactly how she wanted
me to do it–add, read, copy letters (though my handwriting was terrible). I even liked
the hot dog, wax beans, and fried potatoes they served for lunch. The day flew by.
That afternoon when I got off the bus, Jimmy was at the bus stop, tapping his feet,
eagerly waiting for me.


54 “Look!” He had a small animal skull in his hands.


55 “What is it?”


56 “I think it’s a beaver,” he said. “Too big to be a cat. I found the bones in the woods.
Here. It’s for you.”


57 The next day when I stepped off the bus he gave me an old wasp nest. Every day, as
soon as I got off the bus, he’d hand me a treasure he’d found in the woods.


58 I knew Jimmy would be going to school soon, and I was worried about him. I tried to
get him ready for it.


59 “It’s not like home,” I said. “You’ve got to follow the rules, or you’ll get in trouble.”


60 “What rules?”


61 “Like, you can’t just talk whenever you want,” I explained. “You raise your hand if you
want to say something. Okay?”


62 “Okay!” Eyes closed, he raised his hand and pointed straight up.


63 “This is serious,” I told him. “Do you know the Pledge of Allegiance?”


64 “The what?” he asked. I made him stand with me in the kitchen, put his hand on his
heart, and pledge allegiance to an imaginary flag on the wall. Jimmy groaned and
rolled his eyes.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 5** **177**


65 “They say the Pledge every morning, so you’ve got to know it, and you’ve got to know
it by heart,” I said, jabbing him lightly in the chest. “Better learn it now.”


66 The following September, the big day came. Jimmy held my hand and giggled nervously
when the bus arrived. We ran up the stairs together, and Jimmy sat on the edge of his
seat all the way to school. When we got there, a woman met us and pinned a paper circle
to his shirt. My brother shot me one last look before the lady led him away.


67 That day I spotted Jimmy only once, walking in a line with other kids, headed into the
cafeteria. In the woods he always knew exactly where he was. But standing in that noisy
cafeteria, with his freckles and thick glasses and cowlicky hair, Jimmy looked lost.


68 When Jimmy got off the bus that afternoon he went straight to the woods. I didn’t see
him again until supper time.


69 That night I asked Jimmy if he liked school.


70 “Boring.” He didn’t want to talk about it.


71 And that’s the way it was for him every day. He’d come home and go straight to the
woods. He didn’t even wait to change out of his school clothes or eat a snack.


72 School was fine for a kid like me, because I knew how to shut up and listen. But it
seemed wrong to take an outside kid like Jimmy and lock him inside for six hours a
day. They should have had a different kind of school for Jimmy, maybe a place with
acres of unexplored woods and streams and swamps and steep rocky cliffs where he
could spend hours making forts or digging for fossils and animal bones.

sneaked a peek at Jimmy’s. His grades were
lower than mine, a lot lower, which didn’t
make any sense. I knew that Jimmy was
smarter than me, but on that report card,
there was no grade for knowing where
snakes sleep in the heat of day, for being
able to tell the difference between the skull
of a cat or a beaver, a salamander or a
mud puppy. It wasn’t fair, but I told myself
that the woods would always be the place
where Jimmy learned best. In that school
he would always be a straight-A student.

**Scout’s Honor**

1 Back in 1946, when I was nine, I worried that I wasn’t tough enough.

That’s why I became a Boy Scout. Scouting, I thought, would make a

man of me. It didn’t take long to reach Tenderfoot rank. You got that for

joining. To move up to Second Class, however, you had to meet three

requirements. Scout Spirit and Scout Participation had been cinchy. The

third requirement, Scout Craft, meant I had to go on an overnight hike in 79



the country. In other words, I had to leave Brooklyn, on my own, for the

first time in my life.


2 Since I grew up in Brooklyn in the 1940s, the only grass I knew was in

Ebbets Field where the Dodgers played. Otherwise, my world was made

of slate pavements, streets of asphalt (or cobblestone), and skies full of tall 139



buildings. The only thing “country” was a puny pin oak tree at our curb,

which was noticed, mostly, by dogs.


3 I asked Scoutmaster Brenkman where I could find some country. Now,

whenever I saw Mr. Brenkman, who was a church pastor, he was dressed

either in church black or Scout khaki. When he wore black, he’d warn us

against hellfire. When he wore khaki, he’d teach us how to build fires.

4 “Country,” Scoutmaster Brenkman said in answer to my question, “is

anywhere that has lots of trees and is not in the city. Many boys camp in

the Palisades.”


5 “Where’s that?”


6 “Just north of the city. It’s a park in Jersey.”


7 “Isn’t that a zillion miles from here?”


8 “Take the subway to the George Washington Bridge, then hike across.”


9 I thought for a moment, then asked, “How do I prove I went?”

about Scout’s honor?”

Phillis Wheatley Cunne-Shote enslaved African

|Description|Who Am I?|
|---|---|
|I fought for the British because I was promised I<br>would be freed if I fought for them.||
|My pastor says it is important to be loyal<br>to the Church of England and to the British<br>government, even though I don’t live in<br>England.||
|I fought alongside colonists in the French<br>and Indian War, so naturally I chose to fight<br>with General Washington’s army during the<br>Revolutionary War.||
|I protest the Stamp Act and hope we will<br>defeat the British!||
|I fought for the British because I believed they<br>would help keep the colonists from moving<br>west.||
