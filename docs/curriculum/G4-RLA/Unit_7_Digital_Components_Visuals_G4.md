##### Wonderful World

Whimsical whales whirl in the wide ocean.

Outstanding orange orchards smell so sweet.

Refreshing rainbows radiate a range of colors.

Lush leaves line the limbs of trees.

Dazzling days dance into the night.

##### Thinking like a Poet

Many ways exist to write a poem, and poets have to make choices about the way they want their poems to look and sound. They have to
decide things about content, or the poem’s message, and form, or the poem’s structure or appearance.

Here are some things poets have to decide about a poem’s form:

        - How many stanzas, or groups of lines, the poem will have

       - How many lines each stanza will have

       - Whether the poem will include a rhyme scheme

Here are some things poets have to decide about a poem’s content:

        - What their poem will be about (the poem’s subject or content).

        - What message they want to present about their subject. For example, they might want to describe their subject, make a claim about it,
or tell a story about it. The poems in this unit all tell story about a subject.

        - What angle or perspective they want to take on their subject, or whom the poem’s narrator will be. This is often referred to as point
of view.


Unit 7 Lesson 2 **Component 1** **8**


**First-person** point of view is used when speakers or narrators describe stories or events that include them as characters.
It often includes words such as I, me, my, we, or us.


For example, a student named Lauren might say:
_One time I dreamed I could fly._


This would be first person, since Lauren is talking about her own experience. Lauren is a character in the sentence she narrates.


**Third-person** point of view is used when speakers or narrators describe stories or events that do not include them as characters.
It often uses words such as he, she, it, or they.


For example, Lauren’s classmate José might describe Lauren’s dream:
_Once Lauren dreamed she could fly._


This would be third person, since José is talking about someone else’s experience. José is not a character in the sentence he narrates.


Here’s an example of how José might make his sentence first person:
_Lauren told me that once she dreamed she could fly._


This sentence is in first person, since José is a character in it. He describes an event he experienced with Lauren.


Unit 7 Lesson 2 **Component 2** **9**


## Oh great! I’m starving now.

Unit 7 Lesson 4 **Component 1** **10**


##### Short Constructed Response Reading Question

Read the question carefully. Then write your answer.

How does the poem, “Casey at the Bat,” differ from a short story?

Support your answer with evidence from the text.

To obtain full credit (2 points), the student will write a complete response that:

          - explains what distinguishes the text as a poem.

          - includes at least one piece of supporting evidence from the text.

          - cites the text evidence with a stanza, line, or page number.

          - uses evidence accurately to support the response.


Unit 7 Lesson 10 **Component 1** **11**


##### Vocabulary

1. Determine the **syllabication** of a word by clapping or tapping syllables.

2. Identify known word parts.

3. Use your knowledge of root words, prefixes, and suffixes to help you determine the **word’s origin** .

4. Use your knowledge of decoding and the word’s origin to help you determine the word’s **pronunciation** .

5. Lastly, use your background knowledge and your understanding of word parts to help you determine the word’s **meaning** and **part of**
**speech** .

6. After analyzing the word on your own, use the glossary or an online dictionary to check your work.


Unit 7 Appendix **12**


##### Vocabulary

1. Let’s think about how the pronunciation and syllabication of words affect the sound and meaning of a poem.

2. We will break into five small groups.

3. Each group will be given one of our core vocabulary words from today’s poem (i.e. _crave, lack, radiate, steed, whimsical_ )

4. Each group will:

         - Determine how many syllables are in the word

         - Determine the word’s pronunciation

         - Use the glossary or an online dictionary to determine the word’s meaning

         - Try rereading the poem, this time replacing your word with a synonym. Does this change how the poem sounds? Does it
change the meaning?

5. Each group will share what they learned about how the poet’s word choices can affect the sound and meaning of a poem.


Unit 7 Appendix **13**


##### Vocabulary - Dice Vocabulary Game

1. With a partner you will play the Dice Vocabulary Game.


2. Using the vocabulary words from the lesson and the glossary pages in the Activity Book, do the activity according to what

number is rolled.


a. Roll a 1 - give the definition


b. Roll a 2 - give a synonym or antonym


c. Roll a 3 - create a sentence using the word


d. Roll a 4 - determine how many syllables


e. Roll a 5 - determine the part of speech


f. Roll a 6 - identify word parts & predict the word’s origin
