**World War II & Resistance**


**The Start of World War II and Nazi Resistance**


1 What do you think is the most defining event in world history in the past one
hundred years? It is hard to narrow it down to one event, but many people would
answer that question with World War II. Lasting from 1939 to 1945, World War II
involved more than seventy countries all over the world. Take a look at the map. Can
you name some of the countries involved?


**The Role of World War I**


2 To understand the events of World War II you must look at a war fought about
twenty years earlier. World War I was fought from 1914 to 1918. The war was fought
between two major **alliances** . The Central Powers were an alliance primarily between
Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. They fought against the Allied
Powers. The Allied Powers over time became an alliance of many countries, including
Great Britain, France, Russia, and eventually, the United States.


3 After four years of fighting, Germany and the other Central Powers had been worn
down by World War I and its leaders agreed to surrender to the Allied Powers in
1918. The leaders of the Allied Powers met to plan for the future of the countries
involved in the war.


4 Germany and the Allied Powers signed the Treaty of Versailles (/vair*sy/) in June
1919. The Treaty of Versailles impacted all of the Central Powers, but especially
Germany. It limited the size of Germany’s military, required Germany to pay a huge
amount of money to fix the damage caused by the war, and forced Germany to give
up land that was previously part of Germany to other countries.


**Nazi Germany**


5 By the early 1920s, Germany’s economy was struggling. Many German citizens
became very poor. They felt that their leaders’ decisions had caused the difficult

continued



economic times. They felt ashamed that their country, which had once been so strong,
was now so weak. Many were ready for a change. A new political party led by Adolf
Hitler called the National Socialist German Workers Party, or Nazi Party, was formed
in 1920.


6 Hitler and the Nazi Party blamed the problems that Germans faced on its enemies.
He stoked the anger of the German public, saying that the countries Germany had
fought in World War I were preventing the German people from succeeding. He
also blamed minority groups who lived in Germany for being part of a plan to keep
ordinary Germans from being successful. Jewish people had lived in Germany for
more than a thousand years but represented a small minority in the country. Hitler
and the Nazi party falsely claimed Jewish people were responsible for Germany’s
defeat in World War I and Germany’s economic problems.


7 The Nazi Party grew in popularity in Germany because many German people
thought the party would be better for their country. After the Nazis came to power in
Germany, they established a **totalitarian** government, which meant that the people
of the country had few rights and were required to do what the government said.
Hitler and the Nazi government targeted Jews and other groups for discrimination,
persecution, and **incarceration** . Discrimination against Jewish people is known as
Anti Semitism. Eventually, the Nazis would establish large prisons or **concentration**
**camps** where Jews and other minority groups were forced to move. Ultimately,
millions of Jewish people would be killed by the German government.


8 During the 1930s, Hitler directed Germany to build up its military in order to take
control of more land. This directly violated the Treaty of Versailles. The Nazis wanted
to spread their beliefs, and they wanted Germany to become a world power.


9 How did countries around the world respond to Hitler’s actions? Other countries
condemned Germany’s action with strong statements but did not do anything
militarily. With the memory of World War I still fresh, they wanted to avoid another
war. But this only led Hitler to take more land. When Hitler invaded Poland in
September 1939, many in Europe knew Hitler had to be stopped. This was the official
start of World War II.

10 Countries involved in the war were divided into the Axis Powers and the Allied
Powers. The Axis Powers included Germany, Japan, and Italy. At the beginning of the
war, the Allied Powers included France and Great Britain. The Allies later included
the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and many other countries.


**Resistance to the Nazis**


11 From 1939 to 1941, there was a series of Nazi invasions in Europe. The Nazis used
their military to take control of other countries quickly. In May 1940, Germany
attacked France, taking control of the country in just six weeks. A month earlier, in
April 1940, Germany took over Norway before the Allies could **mobilize** to protect
the country. At the same time, Germany also invaded Denmark.


12 Denmark’s king, Christian X, knew that his country was not prepared to fight against
the Germans. Instead of fighting back militarily, he decided that Denmark would
agree to German demands when they invaded, in order to protect the people of
Denmark. The people of Denmark, the Danish, made plans to refuse Nazi rule in
secret. Plans to refuse, prevent, or challenge Nazi rule was called **resistance** .


13 The Danes wanted to make things more difficult for the Germans, but in order to
survive, they had to look like they were obeying German commands in public. This
is because the civilians in **occupied** zones had to follow the Nazi’s orders or else risk
their lives. People in German-occupied cities had to follow strict rules. German
soldiers often stopped citizens on the street for questioning. They also searched their
homes and took things without warning. There was often a curfew, which meant
people were not allowed to leave their homes after a certain time at night. Breaking
curfew in a Nazi-occupied area meant risking death.


14 Life was hard for the people in Nazi-occupied cities. The war led to shortages of food,
supplies, and electricity, especially in occupied zones. These supplies were often used
to feed and support the Nazi military. Yet many resisted in secret ways. In Denmark,
one way the people resisted was by destroying war materials and supplies. They also
stopped trains and ships from transporting German goods. King Christian X even
destroyed Denmark’s own warships in order to keep Germany from using them. One
of the most remarkable resistance movements in Denmark involved saving Jewish
people living there. You will read more about this in the novel _Number the Stars_ .

15 In Europe, the Nazis were eventually defeated. America joined the Allies in 1941.
Allied armies led by America and Great Britain drove the Nazis out of France. They
eventually pushed into Germany, and **liberated** Denmark. The Army of the Soviet
Union also attacked Germany, and together, Hitler and the Nazis were defeated in
1945.

**Passage 1: “Mercury and the Woodman,” by Aesop**


1 A poor Woodman was cutting down a tree near the edge of a deep pool in the
forest. It was late in the day and the Woodman was tired. He had been working since
sunrise and his strokes were not so sure as they had been early that morning. Thus it
happened that the axe slipped and flew out of his hands into the pool.


2 The Woodman was in despair. The axe was all he possessed with which to make a
living, and he had not money enough to buy a new one. As he stood wringing his
hands and weeping, the god Mercury suddenly appeared and asked what the trouble
was. The Woodman told him what had happened, and straightway the kind Mercury
dived into the pool. When he came up again, he held a wonderful golden axe.


3 “Is this your axe?” Mercury asked the Woodman.


4 “No,” answered the honest Woodman, “that is not my axe.”


5 Mercury laid the golden axe on the bank and sprang back into the pool. This time he
brought up an axe of silver, but the Woodman declared again that his axe was just an
ordinary one with a wooden handle.


6 Mercury dived down for the third time, and when he came up again, he had the very
axe that had been lost.


7 The poor Woodman was very glad that his axe had been found and could not thank
the kind god enough. Mercury was greatly pleased with the Woodman’s honesty.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 10** **57**


8 “I admire your honesty,” he said, “and as a reward you may have all three axes, the
gold and the silver as well as your own.”


9 The happy Woodman returned to his home with his treasures, and soon the story
of his good fortune was known to everybody in the village. Now there were several
Woodmen in the village who believed that they could easily win the same good
fortune. They hurried out into the woods, one here, one there, and hiding their axes
in the bushes, pretended they had lost them. Then they wept and wailed and called on
Mercury to help them.


10 And indeed, Mercury did appear, first to this one, then to that. To each one he showed
an axe of gold, and each one eagerly claimed it to be the one he had lost. But Mercury
did not give them the golden axe. Oh no! Instead he sent them home. And when they
returned the next day to look for their own axes, they were nowhere to be found.

**Passage 2: “Benjamin Banneker”**


1 Imagine that you are given an old-fashioned pocket watch. Because you are a curious
person and you are interested in how the watch works, you take it apart. Looking at
the array of watch parts, you have an idea. Is it possible to use the watch as a model
and build a large clock with the same kinds of working parts? It sounds like it could
work, but where will you begin? How will you enlarge the design of the watch to build
the clock? What materials will you use for the clock parts? It sounds challenging,
doesn’t it? Believe it or not, a man named Benjamin Banneker accomplished this task
in 1753—more than 250 years ago. And he did it without the use of modern tools
or technology. He built the clock from wood, and he carefully carved each of the
gears. That clock ran for more than 40 years and kept almost perfect time. Benjamin
Banneker used his brilliant mind in this and other ways to examine and improve the
world around him.


2 Benjamin Banneker was born near Baltimore, Maryland, in 1731. Many African
Americans were enslaved during this time in American history, but Benjamin was
born a free man. Benjamin grew up on his family’s farm. When he was young, his
grandmother taught him to read. Later, Benjamin went to a nearby school where he
showed great skill in mathematics and science. Benjamin’s schooling did not last long,
however, because he was needed on the family farm. While working on the farm,
Benjamin created an irrigation system that allowed crops to be watered even during
dry times. The irrigation system was made up of ditches and small dams. The system
controlled water that flowed from springs near the farm.


3 Banneker was in his early 20s when he built his famous clock. But that
accomplishment didn’t satisfy his curiosity about the world around him. He
continued to learn and grow. When he was older, Banneker began to teach himself
astronomy. Astronomy is the study of the sun, moon, stars, planets, and other bodies
in space. This area of study fascinated Banneker. He loved astronomy so much that he
built a cabin with a skylight. Through this window in the roof, he could observe the
sky during the day and at night. Banneker used his observations to record the weather
and the appearance of stars in the sky. He used his outstanding mathematical abilities
to calculate the tides and correctly predict eclipses of the sun and the moon.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 10** **61**


4 Benjamin Banneker decided to create an almanac in which he would publish all the
useful information that he gathered. Each year between 1792 and 1797, Banneker
published an almanac that included all of his astronomical calculations and weather
predictions. Readers used the facts in their daily lives. They also enjoyed the puzzles,
health tips, and advice on farming that were included in the pages.


5 Benjamin Banneker’s abilities were outstanding. People who knew him thought he
could put his skills to use in other areas. Thomas Jefferson was among those who were
made aware of Banneker’s talents. At that time, Jefferson was secretary of state under
President George Washington. Jefferson requested that Banneker be made part of a
group that was planning the design for the nation’s capital. In 1791, Banneker was
made an assistant to Major Andrew Ellicott. Major Ellicott was the man appointed
by President Washington to lay out the boundaries for the area. Banneker used his
mathematical abilities to help plan the way that Washington, D.C., would look in the
years to come.


6 In 1791, Banneker also sent a copy of the manuscript for his first almanac to Thomas
Jefferson. Along with the almanac manuscript, Banneker included a letter to Jefferson
that expressed how he felt about slavery. Banneker felt that slavery should be
abolished, or ended, and that the abilities of African Americans like himself should be
recognized. Jefferson reacted favorably to the almanac and responded to Banneker’s
comments politely. However, it would be years before slavery was abolished in the
United States.


7 As Banneker grew older, he continued to observe the natural world around him
and to support the anti-slavery movement. He had become well-known and widely
respected, and he often enjoyed visits from scientists and others who admired his
work. Benjamin Banneker died at his home in 1806. Today the contributions of this
farmer, scientist, mathematician, astronomer, writer, and city planner are recognized
around the world. In 1980, the U.S. Postal Service remembered the contributions of
Benjamin Banneker by issuing a stamp in his honor.

**Passage 3: “The Circulatory System”**


1 If you have ever cut your finger or scraped your knee, you know what your own
blood looks like. But have you ever wondered why you need blood or how your blood
travels through your body? Long ago, people did not know a lot about blood. For
example, it was once thought that bloodletting, or taking blood from a person, would
help a sick person. People thought bloodletting would allow a disease to flow out of
a person who was ill. Today we know this is not true. Modern scientists and medical
professionals have learned a great deal more about blood. They have also learned
more about the way blood moves through the body.


2 Blood has many important jobs in the body. It carries life-giving oxygen to body cells
and removes carbon dioxide. Blood also moves nutrients from food to body tissues,
and it carries away waste products. Some cells in blood help protect the body against
disease. Blood also helps distribute heat throughout the body. In addition, it carries
the hormones that a body needs to grow and function.


3 Your blood moves through your body along a network called the circulatory system.
The circulatory system is made up of the heart, blood vessels, and blood itself. At one
time, it was thought that blood was constantly being made and used up in the body.
This idea came from an ancient Greek physician, or doctor, named Galen. Galen
believed that the food we eat was turned into blood in the liver. He thought that blood
flowed through the veins into the body where it was used up. Then new blood would
be made. In the 1600s an English physician named William Harvey proved that this
was not true.


4 William Harvey was a physician at a hospital in London, England. He was also a
doctor to two English kings. Harvey observed blood flow in animals and in the bodies
of humans. He confirmed that the heart is an organ that pumps blood through the
body. He discovered that blood vessels have valves in them that stop the blood from
flowing back the wrong way. In 1628, Harvey published a book that explained how
blood is pumped from the heart through the body and then returned to the heart
again. His paper proved that blood was circulated over and over again in the body.
Harvey also explained the pulse we feel in our bodies. He said the pulse is caused by
blood vessels that expand, or grow larger, each time the heart contracts and sends out
blood. Harvey’s work changed the way doctors thought of the heart and blood vessels.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 10** **65**


5 So just how does the circulatory system work? Let’s begin with the heart and blood
vessels. The heart is a muscular organ that is about the size of a person’s fist. It pushes
blood out when it contracts, or squeezes together, and it pulls blood in when it
relaxes. The blood vessels make up the “pipeline” through which blood flows. You
have so many blood vessels in your body, they could circle the earth more than two
times if they were strung together! There are different kinds of blood vessels. Arteries
are large blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. The arteries take blood
to tiny blood vessels called capillaries. The capillaries are the connections between
arteries and veins. Veins are the blood vessels that take blood back to the heart.


6 Blood itself is made up of liquid and solid particles. The liquid is called plasma.
Plasma is made mostly of water, proteins, and minerals. The solids in blood are called
red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The red blood cells carry oxygen and
carbon dioxide. The white blood cells protect the body from disease and infection.
Platelets help the blood clot. Without the clotting substances in platelets, blood would
keep flowing from a wound and a person might bleed to death.


7 What happens during blood circulation? The heart pumps blood to the lungs where
the blood mixes with oxygen. The blood then goes back to the heart again and is
pumped through the arteries to the capillaries. As the blood travels through the
capillaries, oxygen and nutrients are delivered to body tissues. The blood also picks
up carbon dioxide and other waste products that the body does not need. The blood
crosses through the capillaries into the veins. Now it’s on its way back to the heart.
When the blood reaches the heart, it is pumped into the lungs. In the lungs, carbon
dioxide is removed from the blood and fresh oxygen is mixed with the blood again.
Other waste products have already been removed from the blood along the way by
the liver and the kidneys.


8 Your heart, blood, and blood vessels do an amazing job of making sure your body
stays strong, healthy, and alive. And they do it in a very short time. It might seem that
it would take hours or even days for blood to circulate through your body. But it takes
less than a minute. The circulatory system is one of the most important systems in
your body. The next time you feel your pulse or hear your heartbeat, remember how
hard your circulatory system is working for you!

**Paul Bunyan**


Even as a baby, Paul Bunyan was mighty big. How big? Well, he was so big that his 18

parents had to use a covered wagon for his cradle. 28


As you might imagine, young Paul Bunyan had a big appetite. He gobbled up five 43

barrels of porridge a day, and his parents had to milk four dozen cows every morning and 60

evening just to keep his baby bottle filled. 68


Paul was so big it caused some problems in the little town in Maine where he grew 85

up. When he sneezed, he blew the birds from Maine to California. When he snored, the 101

neighbors ran out of their houses hollering, “Earthquake! Earthquake!” 110


After that, Paul’s father thought it might be better if Paul didn’t sleep in town. He built 127

a cot on a large raft for Paul and floated it off the coast. Paul slept on the raft for a few 149

nights, but the floating cot didn’t work out. When Paul turned over in his sleep, he created 166

gigantic waves that knocked down houses along the coast. 175


Eventually, Paul’s father decided that the East Coast was just too small for Paul 189

Bunyan. The only sensible thing to do was to move out West. So the Bunyan family 205

moved to Minnesota. In those days Minnesota was full of logging camps, sawmills, and 219

lumberjacks. Americans were moving west and “building the country.” They had to cut 232

down a lot of trees to make their homes, not to mention their schools, churches, boats, 248

and furniture. 250
