#### **Point of View**

###### In literary works of fiction, point of view is a literary device that authors use to give perspective to the story being told. The narrator’s point of view is important to how readers understand the story. The narrator is the one telling the story. First-person and third-person point of view are often used in works of fiction. The second-person point of view is less common.

Unit 10 Lesson 2 Component 2.3 **9**


#### **Point of View (continued)**



|First-Person|Second-Person|Third-Person|
|---|---|---|
|**• When the story is told from a**<br>**first-person point of view, the**<br>**narrator is a character in the**<br>**story and describes events as**<br>**they happen or happened to or**<br>**around them.**<br>**• First-person pronouns like I**<br>**and we are used to tell the**<br>**story.**<br>**Example:** I spent all afternoon<br>searching with no luck. Finally, my<br>sister arrived and, as we ate lunch,<br>my hope was renewed.|**• When the story is told from a**<br>**second-person point of view,**<br>**the narrator continuously**<br>**addresses the reader or**<br>**audience directly.**<br>**• Second-person pronouns like**<br>**you and your are used in the**<br>**text.**<br>**Example:** You can’t go on thinking<br>you’re the only person who<br>understands what’s happening.<br>Other people see what you see and<br>want the same things you want.|**• When the narrator tells the**<br>**story from a third-person**<br>**point of view, the story is not**<br>**happening to them. It’s as**<br>**though they’re watching or**<br>**remembering the characters**<br>**and events.**<br>**• Third-person pronouns like he,**<br>**she, and they are used to tell**<br>**the story.**<br>**Example:** Stacey went into the<br>restaurant thinking she would see<br>Jeff sitting at the corner table. She<br>should have known that he would<br>let her down yet again.|

Unit 10 Lesson 6 Component 6.2

#### **Language and Voice**

###### **Author’s Language:**


**• The author’s language sets the overall tone of the written work. The author may use language**
**in different ways to create unique voices for the narrator and/or characters.**

**• Language can include the vocabulary and point of view in a written work, as well as other**
**literary devices, such as dialogue, metaphor, simile, repetition, etc.**

**• Language may be formal, informal, serious, funny, dramatic, emotional, suspenseful, etc.**

**• To understand the author’s use of language in a text, ask yourself how the words the author is**
**using make you feel. Do the words make you feel relaxed? Do they make you laugh, cause you**
**to think deeply about a topic, or feel disturbed?**

###### **Character’s Voice:**


**• The character’s voice is created by the author and expresses the character’s unique**
**personality traits and feelings.**

**• An author’s use of language reveals the voices of the characters they are writing about.**

**• To understand a character’s voice in a text, ask yourself what the character’s traits are and**
**reflect on how the character interacts with others in the story. What words does the character**
**use? Does the character use many words or few? What sorts of feelings do their words**
**express? How is the character’s personality reflected in the text?**
