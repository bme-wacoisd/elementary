**Powerful Forces and Gradual Change**

During the 1700s and 1800s, many people skilled in
scientific **observation** became convinced that Earth’s surface
features do indeed change. They noticed how great masses
of rock appeared to have been lifted up to form cliffs and
mountains over time. They began to think that once-tall
mountains had been worn down by wind, rain, and ice and
that, over thousands of years, valleys had been carved by rivers
flowing through them. These scientists found **evidence** that
seemed to show that sea levels had been higher—and lower—
at different times in the past. They found layers of rock on
mountain peaks that contained **fossils**, the preserved remains
of things that lived long ago. These scientists observed how big
rocks gradually broke down into tiny pieces called **sediments** .
They saw how new rocks formed as they observed volcanic lava
cool and harden.


**Fossils help provide information**
4 **about the history of the earth.**


All these observations led many scientists to think that powerful
natural **forces** were at work changing Earth’s surface. Most of these
changes were thought to have taken place very slowly. Over long
periods of time, slow, gradual changes added up to produce dramatic
results. These scientists were convinced that Earth’s rocky surface
had changed continuously throughout the planet’s long history. It had
changed in the past, and Earth was changing in the present, too.


These ideas laid the foundation for the modern science of geology.
Geology is the study of the makeup of the earth and the forces and
processes that shape and change it. Rocks are very important in
geology. That’s because rocks hold clues to how Earth’s surface has
changed over time. Together with fossils, rocks provide information
about the history of the earth.

##### **Shen Kua’s Observations**

Shen Kua was a Chinese
scientist and mathematician
who lived from 1031–1095 AD.
He studied rocks and fossils
and made many observations
of Earth’s surface features.
Shen Kua realized that Earth’s
surface is shaped very slowly
by powerful forces. Some
forces wear rocks down.
Others make new rocks and
push them up to become
mountains. Shen Kua reached
these conclusions hundreds of years before European scientists did.

**Discoveries of rock layers, as well as coal and salt,**
**indicated that the continents had once been joined.**



**Search for Clues**

So what about the
jigsaw-puzzle fit of the
continents? During the
1800s and early 1900s,
**geologists** studied rock
layers on the continents.
They made many intriguing
discoveries. For example,
rock layers along the
northern and eastern
coasts of South America
match rock layers along
Africa’s western coast. Also,
deposits of **coal** and salt in
eastern North America are
similar to those in southern
Europe.



Geologists found fossils of an ancient fern called _Glossopteris_ in
similar rock layers in Africa, India, Australia, and South America. They
found fossils of an ancient reptile, _Lystrosaurus_, in both southern Africa
and India. In South America and Africa, fossils of another ancient
reptile, _Cynognathus_, turned up directly across the Atlantic Ocean from
each other.


These discoveries seemed to indicate that the continents had once
been joined—but how? Furthermore, how had they become separated?
Several scientists proposed explanations, but they were quite farfetched. One involved a gigantic eruption from the center of the earth
that ripped all the land apart. Another suggested that part of Earth’s
land broke away to become the moon and what was left became the


6


continents. Few people paid much attention to these ideas. A better
explanation was needed, one with evidence to support it. In the early
1900s, Alfred Wegener provided just that.

**Enter Alfred Wegener**

Born and educated in Germany,
Alfred Wegener was interested in
many scientific subjects, including
weather, astronomy, and cold, polar
regions. Around 1910, Wegener
read a scientific paper about similar
fossils and rock formations found on
different continents. He was intrigued
by the mystery of continents
matching and wanted to solve it.


Wegener gathered evidence. He
pulled together discoveries made
by many other scientists about rock **Alfred Wegener**
formations, fossils, and mountain
ranges. Polar explorers had recently unearthed fossils of _Glossopteris_ in
Antarctica. Similar fossils had previously been found in other parts of
the world. This seemed to indicate that ice-covered Antarctica might
once have been joined to South America, Africa, India, and Australia.
It also meant that Antarctica had once had a **climate** warm enough for
ferns to grow.


From this evidence, Wegener **concluded** that all the presentday continents had been joined as one huge landmass long ago. He
understood, as with any new discovery, that his conclusions might be
altered or challenged in the future by more evidence. Nonetheless, he
thought that the existing evidence supported his conclusions.

**Continents that Drift**

If Wegener’s conclusions were correct, then how had the continents
moved apart? An important clue came from the ocean. The ocean
was still largely unexplored in Wegener’s day. In the 1870s, however,
scientists discovered that much of the ocean bottom was made of
basalt, a heavy, **dense** rock that is formed when lava cools and hardens.
Lava is magma that has erupted up above Earth’s crust from deep
underground. Most rocks that make up the continents are lighter and
less dense than basalt.
##### **Seafloor Discoveries**


about the ocean floor. The ship visited every
ocean except the Arctic Ocean. Scientists on
board dredged up mud, rocks, and ocean
creatures from the seafloor.


depth, by lowering weighted
lines into the water. They
measured out the line until
the weight landed on the
bottom. The scientists used
the soundings to make
rough maps of the seafloor
in different places. They
discovered that the seafloor
has vast plains, tall mountain
ranges, and deep valleys. **HMS** _**Challenger**_


8


wondered. “Could they float over the denser rocks of the ocean bottom and
move around?”





In 1915, Wegener published a book titled _The Origins of Continents_
_and Oceans_ . In it, he presented his **hypothesis** about how the earth’s
continents had moved over time. He called the process **continental drift** .


Wegener estimated that about 240 million years ago, Earth had one
huge landmass. He described it as a supercontinent and named it Pangaea,
from the Greek word _pangaia_, meaning “all the Earth.” At some point,
Pangaea broke up, and the pieces—the continents—very slowly **drifted**
away from each other. As the continents moved, mountain ranges pulled
apart. Rock formations split. New oceans filled in the widening gaps
between the landmasses. Groups of plants and animals that had once lived
together were separated. As continents drifted, their climates changed.
Antarctica’s climate, for example, grew so cold that the continent’s plants
and animals died. Only their fossils remained, buried under snow and ice.


9


**The Missing Puzzle Piece**


Wegener’s continental drift hypothesis explained the fit of the
continents. It explained how matching rocks, fossils, and land features
ended up in different places. It explained how the climate had changed
on some continents, too. Yet other scientists criticized Wegener’s
ideas and rejected his hypothesis. Why? It didn’t explain how drifting
continents actually moved. He had not identified a natural process
powerful enough to slowly move enormous pieces of land across Earth’s
surface. There was a good reason Wegener hadn’t found it, though.
It was hidden beneath Earth’s rocky crust.


10


11


#### **and Moving Plates**





Alfred Wegener’s continental drift hypothesis explained many of
the “why” questions. It explained why the edges of some continents
fit together like puzzle pieces. It explained why continents separated
by vast oceans have similar types of rock formations and fossils. What
the hypothesis couldn’t explain was “how.” How could a mass of solid
rock as large as Asia or North America move thousands of miles across
Earth’s surface? It would take an enormously powerful force to do that.
Geologists in Wegener’s day didn’t know of any force on Earth’s surface
powerful enough to move continents.

12


As a result, most geologists rejected the idea of continental drift.
For decades, Wegener’s hypothesis was harshly criticized. Still, a few
geologists thought Wegener was on the right track. What if the driving
force behind continental drift was below Earth’s surface? How can you
discover what lies beneath Earth’s crust? Oddly enough, earthquakes
helped scientists answer these questions.

**What Waves Reveal**

Have you ever tossed a small rock into a pond? Little waves travel
out from the spot where the rock hits the water’s surface. Although you
can’t see them, waves travel through the water below the surface, too.


An earthquake is a bit like a rock plunking into water. During
an earthquake, the ground shakes. The shaking is caused by waves of
energy traveling out from the earthquake’s source through the earth.
Scientists call these **seismic waves** . Powerful seismic waves can travel
very long distances. They can travel through Earth’s crust and deep
into its interior.


13


Around the time Alfred Wegener was thinking about continental drift,
scientists were studying Earth’s interior using seismic waves. How, you might
ask? By using instruments called seismographs! With this invention they
were able to track seismic waves traveling through the planet. Seismic waves
move in slightly different ways as they move through different materials. For
instance, they travel faster through solids than liquids. Studying seismic waves
helped scientists identify Earth’s four main layers.


Earth’s deepest layer is a solid inner core of very hot metal. This metal
may be nearly as hot as the sun’s surface. The next layer, the outer core, is also
made of hot metal, but it’s liquid, not solid. The mantle surrounds


The slow movement and behavior of this material, caused by heat
and **pressure**, have an impact on Earth’s surface. Above the mantle is
Earth’s outermost layer, the thin, rocky crust. There are two types of
crust: oceanic crust and continental crust. Oceanic crust is covered by
ocean water. Most of the continental crust is dry land, but some of the
crust around the edges is covered by water. Oceanic crust is thinner but
heavier than continental crust.


For scientists interested in continental drift, it was the slowly
moving material in the mantle that caught their attention. Did material
movement in the mantle contribute to crust movement, too? Could
this be part of the reason why continents drift? Some


**Clues from the Seafloor**

During the 1940s and 1950s, new technology using sound waves
enabled scientists to make detailed maps of the seafloor. The maps
revealed long chains of underwater mountains, called mid-ocean
ridges, in all of Earth’s oceans. There was a split, or rift, that ran down
the center of these ridges. The rift was like a seam in a pants leg, where
two pieces of fabric come together.


Scientists dredged up rock samples from mid-ocean ridges. All
the rocks were **basalt** . Mid-ocean ridges seemed to be like long, skinny
strings of volcanoes running along the seafloor.


Scientists collected rocks at various distances from the rift along
a mid-ocean ridge. They discovered that rocks from the edge of the rift
had formed very recently. Rocks farther away from the rift were older.
The farther scientists got from the rift, on either side, the older the
rocks were.


The scientists concluded that mid-ocean ridges form along huge
cracks in Earth’s crust. **Magma** beneath the crust erupts through these
cracks as **lava** . The lava cools into basalt, causing new oceanic crust on
either side of the rift to form.


As new crust is added, older crust gets pushed outward, away from
the rift. Inch by inch, year after year, oceanic crust spreads outward into
ocean **basins** on either side of mid-ocean ridges. Scientists called this
process seafloor spreading. They theorized that as the seafloor slowly
spreads, continents bordering the ocean slowly move apart. Here was
one explanation of how continents could drift!


Scientists knew the earth wasn’t getting bigger. If new crust forms
along mid-ocean ridges, then old crust must be melted or recycled
somewhere else. Scientists guessed that deep **ocean trenches** are places
where crust is sinking down into the mantle.


In the 1960s, scientists formed a new **theory** about how Earth’s
surface changes. They called the theory **plate tectonics** .

**A Matter of Time**

At some boundaries, tectonic plates are
moving apart. As the plates separate, molten rock
flows up from the mantle into the space between
them, forming new crust. Mid-ocean ridges are an

plates along the mid-ocean ridge in the Atlantic
Ocean are moving apart at a rate of about 0.8 to 2 inches per year. That
may not seem like much, but it adds up. Assuming this rate of change
was consistent in the past, then two hundred million years ago, the
landmasses of North America and Europe would have been joined. The
same would be true for South America and Africa. Thanks to separating
plates, these continents now lie on opposite sides of a vast ocean.


At other plate boundaries, tectonic plates

one of the colliding plates slides under the
other. Two plates are colliding this way along the western coast of South
America. A heavier oceanic plate is sliding under a lighter continental
plate. Scientists call this process subduction. Subduction has formed
a deep ocean trench off the coast of Chile and Peru. It has also had a
role in causing the towering Andes Mountains
along the western edge of South America to form.
Similar plate interactions have formed mountain
ranges throughout Earth’s long history.


Finally, tectonic plates slide sideways past

**past one another.**


20


edges press together hard. They often get stuck while the pressure keeps
building. Eventually the pressure gets too great. The stuck edges break
free, causing the plates to jerk past each other.

**Providing the Answers**

The theory of plate tectonics answered many questions in geology.
It explained how Wegener’s Pangaea broke apart. It explained how the
continents have been slowly rearranged over millions of years. The
movement of the plates also explained mid-ocean ridges, deep ocean
trenches, patterns in the locations of mountains, and many other
features on Earth’s surface. The theory has become the cornerstone of
modern geology.


As plates move, interesting things happen. Most of the time, they
happen incredibly slowly. Sometimes, though, the effects of plate
movements are sudden and dramatic. Think earthquakes and volcanoes!
##### **Core Conclusions**

You may never have heard of the
Danish scientist Inge Lehmann. Among
seismologists, however, she is famous.
Around 1900, scientists thought the
earth had just three layers: an outer
crust, a solid mantle, and a liquid core.
Lehmann studied seismograph records
of earthquakes. She analyzed how seismic waves changed as they
traveled through Earth’s interior. Lehmann collected thousands of
records organized in boxes—there were no computers back then!
She saw patterns in how seismic waves behaved as they moved
through Earth. Lehmann concluded that Earth’s core has two parts: a
liquid outer core and a solid inner core. In 1936, she announced her
findings and changed our view of Earth!

#### **and Quakes**

Italian writer Francesco
Petrarch penned the
following **eyewitness**
account in the Middle Ages.
Can you guess what he was
writing about?


_“The floor trembled_
_under my feet; when the_
_books crashed into each_
_other and fell down I was_
_frightened and hurried to_
_leave the room. Outside_
_I saw the servants and_
_many other people running_
_anxiously to and fro. All_





If you said an earthquake, you’re correct! People in northern Italy had
good reason to be pale and frightened on a winter’s day in 1348 AD. On
that day, a large earthquake struck. Thousands of people lost their lives.


Earthquakes are violent natural disasters that strike without
warning. Suddenly, the ground begins to shake. Furniture topples,


22


objects tumble from shelves, and buildings may even collapse. In
1348 AD, people had no idea what caused earthquakes. Today we know
that earthquakes are the result of powerful natural forces at work in
Earth’s crust and mantle.


As you read in Chapter 2, scientists developed the theory of plate
tectonics in the 1960s. The theory explains how Earth’s surface and
interior change over very long periods of time. Some plates are pulling
apart at their boundaries, other plates are colliding, and still others are
sliding past each other. A lot happens at plate boundaries, including
most earthquakes. In fact, one of the easiest ways to locate plate





**Locations of plate boundaries and past earthquake epicenters**

**Forces and Faults**

Try a little **experiment** . Extend your arms out in front of you
parallel to the floor and put your hands together. Keep your palms and
fingers flat against each other. Now start pressing your hands together.
Gradually increase the pressure. When you can’t press any harder, let
your right hand quickly slide forward. That sudden slipping is what
happens at a **fault** .


A fault is a fracture, or crack, in Earth’s crust. Most faults occur along
the boundaries of tectonic plates. As plates move, huge rough blocks
of rock along either side of a fault get stuck against each other. Beneath
the plates, however, material in the mantle keeps moving. This material
exerts more and more pressure on the plates to also keep moving.
Pressure builds along the stuck edges of the fault. Think of your hands
as these edges, pressing harder and harder together. The pressure builds
until the stuck blocks of rock suddenly break and slip past one another.
As they do, a tremendous burst of energy is released. How much energy?
Well, all the energy that accumulated in the rocks during the time they
were stuck and couldn’t move.



**A fault in Iceland**

The Pacific Plate is Earth’s largest
tectonic plate. It lies beneath the
Pacific Ocean. Imagine how much
energy it takes to move that gigantic
rocky plate plus all the water on top of
it. Then imagine all that energy being
released at a fault in just a moment.
Such a colossal burst of energy
travels outward from the fault in all
directions as seismic waves. Seismic
waves make the ground **heave** and
shake. This violent shaking is what
we call an earthquake.


~~**San Andreas Fault**~~


In the United States, one of the most famous faults is the San
Andreas Fault in California. It lies along the boundary between
two tectonic plates that are slowly moving past each other. The
movement, however, is far from steady. For years at a time, blocks
of rock bordering the San Andreas Fault stay stuck. Pressure slowly
builds. Then—wham!—they slip and **trigger** an earthquake. The
1906 San Francisco earthquake was one of the worst in American
history. The sudden slip that triggered it was huge. It caused rocks
on either side of the fault to move more than 20 feet in just seconds!


**Effects of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake**


25


**Shake, Heave, Sway, and Lurch**

All earthquakes begin with huge blocks of rock moving along
faults. The place in Earth’s crust where this happens is an earthquake’s
**focus** . Think of it as the earthquake’s heart, the source of seismic waves.
The focus may be deep in the crust or close to the surface.


The **epicenter** is the point on Earth’s surface directly above
an earthquake’s focus. Some kinds of seismic waves produced by
earthquakes travel deep into Earth’s interior. These seismic waves are the
first noticeable waves at the epicenter. During an earthquake, another
kind of seismic wave called surface waves, make the ground shake, heave,
sway, and lurch. Surface waves are the cause of most earthquake damage.


In Chapter 2, you read about seismographs, which scientists use
to record the shaking of Earth’s surface caused by seismic waves. The
time it takes for seismic waves to reach a seismograph is important in
determining where the earthquake occurred. The longer that seismic
waves take to reach a seismograph, the farther away the earthquake is
from the seismograph.


26


27


**Measuring an Earthquake’s Size**

Scientists also use seismographs to measure an earthquake’s
size, or **magnitude** . During a small earthquake, Earth’s surface may
shake only a little. The seismogram shows these relatively low-energy
seismic waves as little wiggles. During a big earthquake, Earth’s
surface shakes a lot harder. The seismogram shows these high-energy
waves as big zigzags.


The Richter scale is another way scientists measure an earthquake’s
magnitude. The Richter scale assigns a number to an earthquake based
on the largest seismic wave recorded for that earthquake. The higher
the Richter scale number, the stronger the earthquake. For example,
a magnitude 5.0 earthquake on the Richter scale causes 10 times as
much ground shaking as a magnitude 4.0 earthquake. A magnitude 6.0
earthquake causes 10 times more shaking than a 5.0, and so on.


**Damage caused by earthquakes**


28


The Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale uses numbers to measure
earthquake intensity, or the amount of shaking. The numbers are based
on survivors’ descriptions and the amount of earthquake damage. The
higher the number, the stronger the earthquake. The Mercalli scale is less
scientific than the Richter scale, as few people describe events in the same
way.


Pressure along faults can build up for years, even centuries. When
blocks of rock along a fault finally move, the resulting earthquake happens
very quickly. Most earthquakes last just a few seconds. Still, the trouble
may not be over after the ground stops shaking. Large earthquakes are
often followed by **aftershocks** . Aftershocks are like mini-earthquakes.
They are usually smaller and weaker than the main earthquake event.
Aftershocks happen as blocks of rock along the newly slipped fault settle
into place.

**Earthquakes at Sea**


Remember that most earthquakes occur along the boundaries
of tectonic plates. Several plate boundaries are in the ocean, so many
earthquakes occur in the oceanic crust that forms the seafloor. This
is especially true around the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific has many
deep ocean trenches along the edges of its ocean basin. Ocean
trenches form where one tectonic plate is sliding, or subducting,
beneath another plate. Earthquakes are very common in the
continental crust along ocean trenches.


Earthquakes that occur in the crust forming the ocean bottom
can cause the seafloor to shift. This shift can cause seawater, from
the ocean bottom to its surface, to suddenly start to move. The result
is a series of gigantic waves called a **tsunami** .


Tsunamis travel fast—as much as 500 miles per hour. Out in
deep water in the middle of the ocean, you’d hardly notice this great
pulse of water passing by. All that water piles up as the tsunami
approaches a coastline. It becomes a towering wall of water that may
be as tall as a three- or four-story building. The tsunami crashes
onto the shore with incredible force. It **surges** far inland. Then it
goes roaring and churning back out to sea. Tsunamis can cause
terrible destruction.


30


**While scientists cannot predict earthquakes, they are able to give some**
**warning for tsunamis. Depending on its starting point, a tsunami may**
**take many minutes, even hours, to reach land. Several countries have**
**set up tsunami warning systems in the Pacific and other oceans.**


31


32


##### **The Year** **without a Summer**

In the spring of 1815, a
volcano called Tambora erupted
in Indonesia. It was the largest
volcanic eruption in recorded
history. Tambora’s eruption
blasted enormous amounts of
ash high into the atmosphere. In
the months that followed, winds
distributed the ash around the
globe. The **fine** ash particles
in the air blocked some of the
sunlight reaching Earth’s surface.
Less sunlight meant less warmth.
Because of Tambora, the weather
was much colder than normal in
1816. There were hard frosts in
New England all summer long.
A foot of snow fell in eastern
Canada in June. Weeks of cold
rain killed most of the crops in
Europe. Many people called 1816
“the year without a summer.”


33


**What is a Volcano?**

A volcano is a hill or
mountain that forms over a
crack in Earth’s crust from which
lava erupts. The crack leads down to a
chamber, or huge space, filled with magma,
which comes from the mantle.Tremendous
pressure and heat in the mantle force
magma in the chamber upward
through the crack. If the pressure
is great enough, magma erupts
on the surface as lava.


34



**Lava**


**Magma**
**chamber**


Some volcanic eruptions
are relatively calm and quiet
whereas others are sudden and violent.
Each time lava erupts, a new layer of rock
forms, making the volcano bigger and bigger.
Many volcanoes gradually become high, cone-shaped
mountains. Mount Vesuvius in Italy and Mount Fuji in Japan
are good examples of volcanoes with this distinctive shape.


Vesuvius and Fuji have something else in common. They are active
volcanoes. An active volcano is one that is estimated to have erupted
in the past 10,000 years and is likely to erupt again. When an active
volcano hasn’t erupted in a long time, it is considered a dormant
volcano. Extinct volcanoes are those that are estimated to
have not erupted for at least 10,000 years.


**Crust**


**Mantle**


35


**Action at the Edge**

If you wanted to see a lot
of volcanoes, where would
you look? Volcanoes form
where there are cracks and
weak spots in Earth’s crust.
You’ll find those mostly along
the boundaries of tectonic
plates that are moving apart.
Volcanoes are also common
where two plates are slowly
colliding and one plate is
subducting under the other.


The Pacific Plate is one of
Earth’s largest tectonic plates.
It lies beneath the Pacific
Ocean. Along its boundaries,
the Pacific Plate is subducting
under several other plates.
Geologists call the places
where this is happening
**subduction zones** . Deep ocean
trenches and many volcanoes
have formed along subduction
zones. This is because the edge
of a subducting plate melts as
it **descends** into Earth’s hot
mantle. Magma moves up
through cracks in the crust and
erupts to form volcanoes above
the subduction zone.


36


##### **World’s Tallest** **Mountain**

The largest active volcano is
Mauna Loa, a volcano on the island
of Hawaii. Mauna Loa’s last big
eruption was in 1984. The volcano’s
peak is 13,796 feet above sea level
but its base sits on the seafloor.
From top to bottom, this enormous
volcano measures more than 33,000
feet. Mount Everest is considered
the world’s highest mountain at
29,029 feet above sea level, even
though Mauna Loa is taller. This is
because nearly 20,000 feet of Mauna
Loa are hidden beneath the sea.

More than 450 active volcanoes
lie around the edges of the Pacific
Plate. Those are just the ones on
land! Many more rise up from the
seafloor and are hidden beneath the
ocean’s surface. Together, all these
volcanoes form what is called the
Ring of Fire around much of the
Pacific Ocean. It is one of the most
volcanically active regions on Earth.

**A Garden of Geysers**

Have you ever been to Yellowstone
National Park? If so, you’ve stood over
North America’s largest hotspot. A great
**plume** of magma rises from the mantle
at this spot. It fills an enormous magma
chamber beneath Earth’s crust. In short, Yellowstone sits on top of one
of the world’s largest volcanoes. Geologists call it a supervolcano.


Heat from the magma beneath Yellowstone causes the park’s **hot**
**springs** and geysers to form. Geysers are hot springs that periodically
erupt, like volcanoes of hot water. Geysers form when water drains
down into openings in the ground above the magma chamber. Heat
from the magma turns the water scalding hot. As the hot water rises
back up through the openings, some of it turns to steam. This increases
the pressure, forcing the mixture of steam and hot water to rush and
bubble upward. When it reaches the surface, a hissing fountain of hot
water and steam explodes out of the ground. Yellowstone’s most famous
geyser is called Old Faithful. It got its name because it erupts reliably
more than a dozen times a day.


Magma itself hasn’t erupted from the Yellowstone hotspot for
hundreds of years. Could the Yellowstone supervolcano erupt again? It’s
possible, geologists say, but most doubt it will happen anytime soon.


**Yellowstone National Park’s geysers and hot springs are all formed by the heat of the**

buildings. Indoors, pieces of rock often make up floors, walls, stairs,
and countertops. Museums are good places to see rocks that artists
have carved into sculptures. The polished stones in some types of
jewelry are rocks that people wear.


42


**Rocks are all around us.**


**Rocks and Building Blocks**

Just what are rocks, exactly? Rocks are naturally occurring materials
made of solid, nonliving substances called **minerals** . Think of minerals
as the building blocks of rocks. Some rocks are formed from just one
mineral. Most rocks, however, are combinations of two or more minerals.
Minerals appear as different-sized pieces, or grains, in rocks. Some rocks
have very tiny mineral grains, giving the rocks a smooth, even **texture** .
Other rocks have larger mineral grains and a rougher texture.


Imagine hiking up a mountain and picking up rocks along the way.
When you reach the top, you’ll probably have quite a collection. Your
rocks may have different colors and textures. Some may have stripes
or layers. Some might be hard and others crumbly. Some have tiny
grains whereas others have large grains that glitter when they catch the
light. All this variety might seem confusing. Yet geologists organize all
rocks into just three classes, or basic types: igneous, sedimentary, and
metamorphic.


43


**Born from Magma: Igneous Rock**

Let’s start with **igneous rocks**, the most abundant class of rocks on
the earth. Igneous rocks form when magma cools and **solidifies** . When
you think of igneous rocks, think of volcanoes.


There are two basic types of igneous rock. One type forms from
magma that erupts onto Earth’s surface as lava. The lava cools and
hardens into rock. The faster it cools, the smaller the mineral grains will
be in the resulting rock. **Obsidian** is an igneous rock formed from lava
that cooled very quickly, so quickly, there wasn’t time for the minerals
to form grains. As a result, obsidian is as smooth and shiny as glass. In
fact, it is often called volcanic glass. Basalt is an igneous rock formed
from lava that took longer to cool. Basalt is typically a dark-colored
rock. It has fairly small mineral grains that give it a fine-grained texture.


The second type of igneous
rock forms from magma that
solidifies below Earth’s surface.
Magma cools very slowly when
it’s deep beneath the surface.
Slow cooling leads to igneous
rocks with relatively large
mineral grains. The slower the
cooling, the larger the grains.
**Granite** is a common igneous
rock that forms from magma
that cooled within Earth’s crust.
Granite usually contains mineral
grains that are large enough to
see with the naked eye.


**Granite was used in the construction of**
**the Texas state capitol building**


44


##### **The Art of Making Stone Tools**

Many prehistoric cultures made tools out of rock. Scientists
working in East Africa have found obsidian stone tools that scientists
estimate to be nearly two million years old. Obsidian was especially
prized by ancient tool makers. Obsidian breaks into pieces with
sharp edges that are good for cutting and piercing.


To make a very sharp cutting tool, ancient tool makers struck a
block of obsidian with another, harder rock. This caused a long, thin
blade of obsidian to flake off. Although the blade was fragile, it had
incredibly sharp edges. In fact, the edges of obsidian blades are much
sharper than metal scalpels used by surgeons today.


45


**Layer after Layer: Sedimentary Rock**

**Sedimentary rock** is the second major class of rocks. Sedimentary
rocks are made of sediments. Sediments are tiny bits of rock and sand
combined with fragments of once-living things. Sediments collect in
low-lying areas both on land and in bodies of water. They form layers,
one on top of another. Over long periods of time, the weight of overlying

skeletons and shells of tiny ocean creatures. You can see these fossils in
some limestone buildings common to central Texas. Some sedimentary
rocks get their name from their sediments. Sandstone started as grains
of sand, whereas mudstone formed from ancient mud.


46


**The eroded formations of these sedimentary rocks in Badlands National Park in South**
**Dakota show their distinct layers. The oldest layers are at the bottom.** 47


**Changing Form: Metamorphic Rock**

The third major class of rocks is **metamorphic rock** . Metamorphic
rocks form when igneous or sedimentary rocks are exposed to extreme
heat and pressure. They can even form from older metamorphic rocks.
High temperatures and crushing pressure alter the minerals in the rocks.
Mineral grains may be flattened or rearranged into layers, swirls, or
stripes. They may also be changed into completely different minerals!


Remember granite, the igneous rock? When granite is subjected to
intense heat and pressure, it becomes a metamorphic rock called gneiss.
When the sedimentary rock limestone is squeezed and heated deep
below ground, it becomes a metamorphic rock called marble.



Metamorphic rocks tend to form deep within Earth’s crust. The
pressure from countless tons of overlying rock is tremendous. Equally
powerful is the heat rising from hot magma in the mantle beneath the
crust. Metamorphic rocks often form where tectonic plates are slowly
colliding. They can also form as magma travels up through cracks
in Earth’s crust and heats the rocks around the cracks. If the heat
of the magma

##### **Agnes Nyanhongo’s Stone Sculptures**

Zimbabwean sculptor
Agnes Nyanhongo became
interested in carving rock at
an early age. Her father, Claud
Nyanhongo, was a sculptor. She
worked in his studio as a young
girl and learned how to cut and
polish rock. She is now one of
Zimbabwe’s most well-known
artists. Agnes Nyanhongo carves
many of her sculptures from a
type of rock called serpentine.
Serpentine is a metamorphic
rock. The type of serpentine

**Agnes Nyanhongo**

Agnes Nyanhongo uses for
many of her sculptures is very dark in color. She usually polishes only
some parts of her sculptures, leaving the rest simply raw stone.


**Sculptures carved from serpentine**



49


Now imagine that the sedimentary rock is near the edge of a
tectonic plate. The plate collides with another plate—very slowly,
of course. Tremendous heat and pressure generated by the collision
gradually turn the sedimentary rock into metamorphic rock. As the
plates continue colliding, their rocky edges crumple. The metamorphic


50


Alternatively, one tectonic plate might be sliding beneath another.
The metamorphic rock along the edge of the descending plate gets
hotter and hotter as it nears the mantle. At some point it melts into
magma—magma that someday might erupt from a volcano again.


Understanding how rocks change helps geologists understand how
Earth has changed over time.


51


#### **Forces of Change**





Have you ever dodged a pothole while riding your bike? Or
skidded on grit that rain had washed in your path? Potholes and grit
might seem like little more than bike-riding hazards. Yet they are
evidence of two powerful forces at work. Weathering and erosion,
as you read in Chapter 5, are processes that drive the rock cycle.
They break down rock into sediments and then move them to new
locations. Together, weathering and erosion are slowly but
steadily reshaping Earth’s surface. They are changing
everything from the streets in neighborhoods and
towns to the world’s tallest mountains.

**Weathering at Work**

Weathering breaks rock into smaller
pieces. Some of these tiny pieces combine
with once-living material to form topsoil.
Other small pieces of rock collect as
sediments. This breakdown of rocks
happens as they interact with air,
water, and living things. There are
two basic types of weathering:
physical weathering and
chemical weathering.


52


Physical weathering breaks big rocks
into smaller ones without changing the
minerals they contain. Widely swinging
temperatures cause physical weathering.
For example, rocks in a desert bake during
the day beneath the sun’s scorching heat.
As rocks get hot, they **expand** . At night,
temperatures in the desert fall. As rocks
cool down, they **contract**, or shrink slightly.
Expand, contract, expand, contract—this
endless cycle gradually causes the rocks’
outer layer to crumble or flake off.


Water also causes physical weathering.
Water seeps into tiny cracks in rocks. If
temperatures drop below freezing, the water
turns to ice. Water expands as it freezes,
pushing outward and enlarging the cracks.
Geologists call this process ice wedging. Each
time the water freezes, it opens cracks a little
wider. Eventually, the rocks split apart. Ice
wedging is what makes potholes in streets, too.


Plants and animals also cause rocks to
weather. Tree roots squeeze into the cracks
in rocks. As the roots grow, they act like
wedges, forcing the cracks wider and wider.
Eventually the rocks break apart. Badgers,
chipmunks, and other animals burrow into
cliffs and hillsides like tiny bulldozers. As
they dig or tunnel into the ground, they
push buried rocks to the surface where


53


**Glaciers, like this one in**
**Alaska, are powerful forces**
**that can cause erosion.**
58


**Heading Downstream**

Like wind, water also causes erosion. The tug of gravity pulls
sediments out of wind and water. Flowing water picks up sediments
and carries them downhill to new locations. A summer rain can wash
fine sediments onto sidewalks and into gutters. A rushing mountain
stream can sweep small stones into a valley. A flooded river can surge
along with enough force to move large rocks many miles downstream.


As moving water slows, sediments sink to the bottom of the river
or stream. The heaviest sediments are the first to be deposited. The
finest sediments are the last. Layers of sediment accumulate at the
mouths of rivers and on the bottoms of lakes. Vast layers of sediment
are also deposited on the ocean floor over long periods of time. Like
wind-deposited sediments, those laid down by water may someday be
transformed into sedimentary rock.


Water doesn’t have to be in its liquid **state** to erode sediments.
Glaciers are enormous masses of ice found in polar regions and near
the tops of tall mountains. Although ice is solid, glaciers do move.
They flow—very, very slowly—downhill. As countless tons of ice
creep over land or down mountainsides, they push, drag, and carry
eroded sediments along. Moving glaciers also causes sediments to
form as they grind against rocks beside or below them. Glaciers
are such powerful forces that they can carve huge U-shaped valleys
through mountain ranges.


When glaciers melt, they deposit the sediments they have
been carrying. Scientists estimate that 20,000 years ago, glaciers
covered large parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. As the
climate warmed, the glaciers melted and retreated northward. They
left behind massive deposits of sand, gravel, and **silt**, along with
collections of rocks and boulders. You can still see these deposits as
hills, mounds, and ridges on the landscape.


59


**Weathering, Erosion, and Time**

Weathering and erosion work slowly. It takes a long time to see
their effects. Given time, these processes reshape Earth’s surface on a
scale so large it’s almost impossible to grasp. For example, scientists
hypothesize that the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States
did not exist when dinosaurs roamed North America. Wind, rain, and
the Colorado River slowly formed it. These forces cut and shaped the
landscape into what it is today—one of the world’s largest canyons.
The Palo Duro Canyon, known as “The Grand Canyon of Texas,” is
the second largest canyon in the United States and located in the Texas
panhandle near Amarillo.


Scientists think that the Appalachian Mountains in eastern North
America were once a towering mountain range millions of years ago.
The highest peaks may have been more than 20,000 feet above sea level.
Weathering and erosion gradually wore the Appalachians down. Their
highest point today is just 6,684 feet high. As permanent as mountains
seem, weathering and erosion inevitably change them. Even Earth’s
tallest peaks—Everest in Asia, Aconcagua in South America, Africa’s
Kilimanjaro, and Europe’s Mont Blanc—won’t last. They will eventually
be worn down by these endless geological processes. But don’t worry.
Other geological processes are causing new mountains to take their
place to form.


#### **Mountains**





The year was 1953. Mountain climbers Edmund Hillary and
Tenzing Norgay stood on the hard-packed snow. They gasped for


Hillary and Norgay had
just made it to the top of Mount
Everest. They were the first
people to reach Earth’s highest
point, 29,029 feet above **sea level** .


Mountains are some of
Earth’s most awe-inspiring
features. In 1953, geologists
were still searching for answers
as to how mountains form. By
the 1960s, scientific evidence
pointed to plate tectonics as a
driving force behind mountain
building. As you read in
Chapter 2, our planet’s rocky
exterior isn’t one solid piece. It
is broken up into a collection of
gigantic tectonic plates.


Earth’s tectonic plates move
slowly, but their movements
have dramatically changed
Earth’s features over time.
Plate movements have shuffled
Earth’s continents into different
positions. They have destroyed
old oceans and formed new
ones. They have also built
mountains and mountain
ranges in several different ways.



63


**Colliding Continents**

Scientists think that some of
Earth’s highest mountain ranges
formed as sections of continental crust
collided over millions of years. The
collision that formed Mount Everest is
a good example. Everest is part of the
Himalayas, a vast, towering mountain
range between India and China. The
Himalayas formed when continents on
two tectonic plates met head-on.


Can you find India on the map?
It lies along the southern edge of Asia.
India wasn’t always where it is today.
Based on measurements, geologists
conclude that hundreds of millions of
years ago, India was an island. It sat out
in the middle of the Indo-Australian


met, subduction took place. The heavier
oceanic crust of the Indo-Australian
Plate slid under the lighter continental
crust of the Eurasian Plate.


64




As the Indo-Australian Plate kept moving northward, India was
carried along. It inched closer and closer to Asia. The Tethys Sea began
to disappear. Scientists estimate India finally collided with Asia around
40 million years ago. India’s rocky continental crust pressed directly
against Asia’s continental crust.


As the two landmasses continued to be pushed harder and
harder together, the continental crust began to crumple. Enormous
pressure caused by the moving tectonic plate led the rocky crust to
heave upward. Great masses of rock gradually rose up into a series of
enormous folds. The Himalayas were born!


More and more rocks were uplifted as the Indo-Australian Plate
kept moving. The Himalayas rose higher and higher. In fact, they are
still rising. They are growing taller at about the same rate that your
fingernails grow!


Geologists classify the Himalayas as **fold mountains** . The name refers
to the way rocks are pushed up into huge folds by moving tectonic plates.
The Alps, Europe’s highest mountains, are fold mountains that formed
much like the Himalayas. The Appalachians in North America, the Urals in
Russia, and the Sierra de Juarez Mountains in Mexico near El Paso, TX also
formed through collisions of continental crust.


Like many other fold mountains, the Himalayas contain quite a bit
of sedimentary rock. Why? In the case of the Himalayas, it started with
the Tethys Sea. Geologists estimate that for millions of years, erosion
washed sediments from Asia and the ancient island of India into the
Tethys Sea. Countless layers of sediments, along with remains of ocean
animals, were deposited on the seafloor. Over time, pressure and heat
helped turn these sediments into sedimentary rock.


As plate movements slowly brought India and Asia together, some
of these seafloor sedimentary rocks were pushed up. Heat and pressure
from the colliding plates transformed some of them into metamorphic
rocks. Other sedimentary rocks remained relatively unchanged. This is

##### **Fossils at the Top of the World**

Trilobites and crinoids are two of the most

bottom of Earth’s ancient oceans, including the Tethys Sea. Crinoids
were animals, too, but they looked more like plants. Scientists
estimate trilobites and most crinoids became extinct about 250
million years ago. A few types of crinoids still survive far below the
ocean’s surface.


66


**The Andes Mountains in Peru are fold mountains.**

**Folding at the Edges**

Along South America’s western coast, the oceanic Nazca Plate has
been sliding under the South American Plate for millions of years based
on current rates. This has caused massive folds of rock to pile up along
the edge of the continent. These folds are now the Andes Mountains,
the longest mountain range on land.


As you read in Chapter 4, the edge of a subducting plate melts
as it descends into Earth’s hot mantle. The resulting magma moves
up through cracks in the crust. It may erupt on the surface to form
volcanoes. The edge of the Nazca Plate is melting as it slides beneath
the South American Plate. Erupting magma has formed many
volcanoes in the Andes Mountain range.


67


**Faults and Blocks**

The longest, highest mountain ranges on land are mostly fold
mountains. However, moving tectonic plates build mountains in other
ways. **Fault-block mountains** form when gigantic blocks of rock move
up and down along faults.


At some faults, such as the San Andreas Fault in California, blocks
of rock move horizontally past each other as they slip. At other faults,
slips cause blocks of rock on one side of the fault to move up. These
slips also cause blocks on the other side of the fault to move down.
Repeated slips gradually force these rock blocks higher—and lower—to
cause fault-block mountain ranges to form.


Fault-block mountains typically have one steep side and one
sloping side. The steep side forms a high, sheer cliff. Germany’s
Harz Mountains are one example of fault-block mountains. Others
include the Grand Tetons in Wyoming, the Guadalupe Mountains in
west Texas, and the Basin and Range Province of Utah, Nevada, and
Arizona.


**Fault-block mountains form when blocks of rock move up and down along fault lines.**


68


**The Grand Teton Mountains in Wyoming**
**are fault-block mountains.**



69


**Under the Dome**

Most people think of sharp, jagged peaks when they hear the word
_mountains_ . **Dome mountains** are quite different. Dome mountains
look like great humps of rock with rounded tops. They usually occur as
isolated mountains on otherwise flat plains.


Some dome mountains form when magma pushes upward into
Earth’s crust from the mantle. The magma cools into igneous rock
before reaching the surface. This huge lump of igneous rock causes the
crust above it to **bulge**, like a blister on skin. Texas’ Enchanted Rock is a
good example of a dome mountain that formed this way.


**Enchanted Rock is near Austin, Texas**


70


**Mountains on the Prairie**

You can see the
Black Hills of western
South Dakota from a
long way off. These dome
mountains rise up from
the surrounding grassy
plains as dark, hunched
shapes. They are the
highest mountains east of
the Rocky Mountains. Very
ancient granite forms the core of the Black Hills. Weathering and
erosion have exposed this igneous rock in many places. The sculptor
Gutzon Borglum made one tall granite formation in the Black Hills
famous. He carved the faces of four presidents into the rock to create
Mount Rushmore National Memorial. Another sculpture in the
Black Hills has also gained attention—as the world’s largest sculpture
in progress. Crazy Horse Memorial honors North American Indian
heritage and depicts the face of the Sioux leader Crazy Horse. Started


71


Imagine that you are dropping down, down, down into the middle
of the Atlantic Ocean. The seawater outside the **submersible** gets
darker and darker. Soon the light fades completely. Outside is a watery
world as black as night. Finally, the sub’s lights pick up shapes below as
the ocean bottom comes into view. You see lumpy hills and looming
peaks of dark volcanic rock. Welcome to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The
ridge marks the boundary between several enormous tectonic plates.
Portions of these plates form the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.


**Mountains and Moving Plates**

In Chapter 7, you learned some of the ways Earth’s slowly moving
tectonic plates build mountains. Over extremely long periods of time,
their movements have formed many mountains and mountain ranges
on land. Moving plates also build mountains underwater. In fact, there
are more mountains on the seafloor than on all of Earth’s continents
and islands combined.


The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a long, **rugged** underwater mountain
range. It runs for thousands of miles along the boundary between
tectonic plates that meet in the center of the Atlantic Ocean. The plates
are very slowly moving apart at this boundary.


Remember Alfred Wegener? Wegener proposed the idea of
continental drift in the early 1900s. At the time, though, no one knew of
any force powerful enough to move continents around on Earth’s surface.
The theory of seafloor spreading was a big clue to solving the mystery.





**Seafloor spreading was one of several key pieces of geological evidence that led to the**
**theory of plate tectonics. Think of the continents as riding on top of the plates. As the**
**plates move, so do the continents.**


73


It was the study of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that first made scientists
consider the possibility of seafloor spreading. They concluded that, as
the seafloor spreads, the continents on either side of the Atlantic are
pushed farther apart.


Scientists soon discovered that the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is just one
of many mid-ocean ridges. These ridges are found in all the world’s
oceans, wherever tectonic plates are slowly moving apart. Altogether,
mid-ocean ridges form a near-continuous chain of mountains that
wraps around the earth like the stitching on a baseball. Spanning
40,389 miles, the chain of mid-ocean ridges is by far the world’s longest
mountain range. It is also the most volcanically active.


The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is just a part of this gigantic underwater
mountain chain. Erupting lava has built up high walls of basalt on either
side of the rift. The rift itself is nearly as deep as the Grand Canyon! If you
travel along the ridge, you’ll soon see more than just high walls of dark rock.






**Hydrothermal Vents**

At first glance, it looks like a fire. Black smoke is billowing up from
a spot in the ridge. It’s not smoke, though. It’s searing hot, dark water
gushing out of cracks in the rock. It’s a **hydrothermal vent** .


Hydrothermal vents are a bit like geysers in Yellowstone National
Park. These deep-sea geysers are much, much hotter than anything on
land. Hydrothermal vents form as seawater sinks down through cracks
in the oceanic crust. As it nears the magma lying below the crust,
the water is heated to incredibly high temperatures. It can reach an
astonishing 750°F! The water is so hot that it dissolves minerals from
the surrounding basalt. The minerals become part of the hot liquid, like
salt does when it’s stirred into a glass of water.


At a hydrothermal vent, the super-heated, mineral-rich water
comes roaring back up through cracks in the crust. It shoots out of the
rock with the force of water blasting out of a fire hydrant. When hot
vent water meets cold seawater, the dissolved minerals in vent water
become solid again. They form tiny particles. The particles make the
vent water look like dark smoke.


75


##### **Hunting for Hydrothermal Vents**

How do scientists find
hydrothermal vents? They hunt for
them from ships at sea. Hot, mineralrich vent water moves slowly away from
hydrothermal vents. It forms a plume,
or cloud, of mineral particles that drifts
away from the vent, like smoke from a
chimney. If the scientists locate a plume,
they send down a robot vehicle. When
it locates the vent, the robot sends
pictures back to the scientists.


**Hydrothermal vents**


There is more to hydrothermal vents than clouds of hot, black
water. Communities of amazing and unusual animals live around many
of these deep-sea geysers. Red-topped giant tube worms are the largest
animals near vents. Some types of giant tube worms can grow as tall as
a person. The vents are also home to ghostly white crabs, football-sized
clams, and pale, blind shrimp.


Scientists estimate there are tens of thousands of hydrothermal
vents along the world’s
mid-ocean ridges.
Scientists, however, have
explored only a handful of
them. Finding a new one is
always exciting. Scientists
often discover new types of
animals as well.


**Giant tube worms near a hydrothermal vent in the**

**Pacific Ocean**


**Seamounts and Subduction Zones**

**Seamounts** are another type of underwater mountain. Seamounts
are underwater volcanoes that come in many shapes and sizes. Some
are just a few hundred feet high. Others tower thousands of feet above
the seafloor, although their tops are still far beneath the ocean’s surface.
If a seamount grows high enough to rise above the ocean’s surface, it
becomes an island.


Seamounts can form wherever
magma is erupting through the
oceanic crust. Many seamounts form
alongside mid-ocean ridges or along
subduction zones.



Finally, seamounts can also
form over hotspots far from plate
boundaries. The islands that make up
the Hawaiian Island chain began as
seamounts. As you read in Chapter
4, each island formed over a hotspot
that **underlies** the center of the Pacific
Plate. As a result of repeated volcanic
eruptions, each island began as a
small seamount that grew over time.
Eventually, its top broke the water’s
surface, making it an island.



**Seamount that grew into an island**



Scientists estimate that there are at least 100,000 seamounts over
3,000 feet tall in the world’s oceans. Since most seamounts are far
below the ocean’s surface, studying them is a challenge. Scientists have
explored a few **firsthand**, traveling down in submersibles. More often,
they send robot vehicles down to do the investigating.


77


No two seamounts are exactly alike. Many are teeming with life,
even those that are very deep. Water flowing around these deep-sea
volcanoes brings up nutrients from the ocean bottom. Nutrients fuel
the growth of tiny, single-celled organisms in the water. These, in turn,
become food for larger organisms, including animals that live on and
around seamounts. Seamounts are often home to deep-sea corals,
sponges, brittle stars, crabs, and anemones. Great **schools** of fish live
around seamounts, too.


**Deep-sea coral** **Brittle star**
**Into the Trenches**

Seamounts aren’t the only undersea features that form along
subduction zones. Where one plate slides under another, the seafloor
dips down to cause narrow, extremely deep valleys to form. These
ocean trenches are the deepest places on the planet.


The Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean is the deepest ocean
trench. It lies just off the Mariana Islands, east of the Philippines. The
Mariana Trench is hundreds of miles long, but just 43 miles wide. It
is like a deep slash in the ocean bottom. The trench’s deepest known
point is an area called the Challenger Deep. It is 36,070 feet beneath
the ocean’s surface, which is almost 7 miles down. By comparison, the
average depth of the ocean is about 14,000 feet.


78


What is it like in the ocean’s deepest spot? It is pitch black. The
temperature of the water is only a few degrees above freezing. The water
pressure is very high—equivalent to having three big SUVs pressing
down on every inch of your body!


Only three people have traveled to the bottom of the Mariana
Trench. (More people have landed on the moon!) Several robot vehicles
have also made the trip. These visits have provided only brief glimpses
of this remote and extreme environment.
##### **The Lucky Three**

As of 2014, only three people have
traveled to the bottom of the Mariana
Trench only twice. The first expedition
took place in 1960. The explorers were
U.S. Navy Lieutenant Don Walsh and
Swiss scientist Jacques Piccard. Their
underwater vehicle was _Trieste_ . It took
_Trieste_ almost five hours to descend
from the ocean’s surface to the bottom
of Challenger Deep. Piccard and Walsh
peered out a small window onto a part
of the planet that humans had not seen
before.


In 2012, Canadian filmmaker and **Piccard and Walsh in** _**Trieste**_
ocean explorer James Cameron also made the trip. His vessel, _Deepsea_
_Challenger_, was a slim, one-person, underwater vehicle. Cameron’s
descent took just over two and a half hours. He did something Walsh
and Piccard weren’t able to do. He filmed the descent and the view he
had of the ocean floor at 35,756 feet.

#### **The Rock Towns of Cappadocia**


Few houses are as old—or as unusual—as those in Cappadocia,
Turkey. The houses have rock walls, rock floors, and rock ceilings.
Their doors and windows are simply openings in rock. Some houses
have tall, pointed rock towers rising from their rock roofs. Others
have hidden rooms, secret passageways, and tunnels that lead deep
underground. Everything is made of rock.


Cappadocia is a region of Turkey found
in the west-central part of the country. Its
cave-like rock houses are famous, and there
are thousands of them. The houses are
**clustered** into rock villages and towns. People
have been carving and living in these houses
for more than 2,000 years.


Volcanoes, however, laid the original

towns. It is an active volcano and the highest mountain in this part of
Turkey. Erciyes’s rocky peak is 12,848 feet high. In winter, it is often
dusted with snow.


Only minor eruptions
have shaken Erciyes in
recorded history. At times
in the **distant** past, however,
Erciyes and other volcanoes
near it were much more
active. During one or
more major eruptions,

##### **Hoodoos around the World**

You can find hoodoos on almost every continent. Most are
formed from sedimentary rock rather than volcanic tuff. All of them,
though, are the product of weathering and erosion. Bryce Canyon
in the western United States has an abundance of hoodoos. Wind,
rain, and ice wedging have carved them out of sedimentary rock that






**Carving Out Caves**

No one knows who first carved into Cappadocia’s rock formations
to make living—or hiding—spaces. Creating a cave wasn’t difficult.
Tuff is quite soft before it is exposed to air. Scrape away the hard outer
surface and the fresh rock can be cut easily with simple tools. The
surface of newly carved rock hardens quickly in dry air. After that, it
will keep its shape for hundreds of years.


During the 300s AD, Cappadocia became a destination for many
early Christians. It was a place where they felt safe and isolated from
the rest of the world. These religious refugees expanded the existing
caves into larger
rock **dwellings** . They
created rooms for
eating and sleeping.
They carved out
stables for animals
and storage areas
for food. They
cut staircases into
hoodoos and formed
high towers. The
towers had windows
that looked out onto
the surrounding
plains. From these
high places, they
could see trouble
coming from a long
way off. Blocks of
dwellings grew into

**Beautiful paintings cover the walls and ceilings of this church in Cappadocia.**

The early Christian settlers expanded underground, too. They dug
into the underlying tuff, carving out living areas more than five stories
deep. A maze of tunnels, staircases, and passageways connected different
sections. There were even rock ventilation systems for bringing down
fresh air from above ground! The underground **excavations** eventually
grew into several dozen towns. They were large enough to shelter
thousands of people. If invaders or any other kind of threat appeared,
inhabitants of the rock towns above ground headed underground.


By the 600s AD, Christian monks had built more elaborate
rock dwellings. They built large monasteries in which to live. These
monasteries had sleeping quarters, large kitchens, and cellars for
stored food and drink. Each monastery had its own church. At first
the churches were simple and plain. Over time they became more
elaborate. By the 1000s and 1100s AD, Cappadocian monks were
building churches with high, arched ceilings and large **altars** . Artists
decorated the walls and ceilings with beautiful paintings. Thanks to
the region’s dry climate, many of these works of art have survived for
hundreds of years with little damage.

85


**Preserving the Past**

In 1985, part of Cappadocia’s rock town complex was made a
World Heritage Site. World Heritage Sites are considered special places
that are important to protect. The rock houses of Cappadocia are being
carefully maintained to preserve their historical value.


Tourists come
from all over the
world to visit these
unique rock towns.
Guides lead them
through tunnels
and passageways,
as it is easy to get
lost. Visitors can
stay in rock houses
that have been
turned into small
hotels. Imagine **People entering an underground town**
spending the night
in a rock room carved by hand hundreds of years ago! One thing
visitors discover is that there is no need for air conditioning or central
heating. Houses made of tuff stay cool in summer and warm in winter.


Many people walking the streets of Cappadocia’s rock towns are
not tourists. They live there, and the rock houses are their homes.
The walls and floors are hundreds of years old, but the houses have
running water, carpets on the floor, and curtains in the windows. When
homeowners make changes, though, they sometimes get a surprise.
Some have tried to make new rooms in their rock houses. They’ve
started scraping the walls only to break through into old caves that have
been undisturbed for hundreds of years.

##### **The Tuff Carvers of Easter Island**

Easter Island is another place famous for structures carved from
tuff. Hundreds of giant statues dot the hills of this South Pacific island.
The statues, called **moai**, are partial human figures with large heads,
high cheekbones, and heavy brows. Except for differences in height,
all the moai on the island look very much the same. The Rapa Nui
people, the native inhabitants of Easter Island, carved the moai from


To make the statues, Rapa Nui carvers used blocks of tuff cut from
the crater walls. They used sharp stone tools made of basalt to cut
and shape the softer rock. The carvers shaped moai right in the wall
of the crater. When the fronts were finished, they chipped the huge
statues free from the crater wall. Then the moai were moved to a final
destination. Scientists are still debating how they think the Rapa Nui
moved the moai. However they did it, it was quite a task. The largest
moai weigh over 80 tons!


**Enrichment**
#### **Violent Vesuvius**


Mount Vesuvius looms above the Bay of Naples on Italy’s west
coast. Vesuvius is one of several Italian volcanoes that formed where
two tectonic plates are very slowly colliding. As one plate creeps
beneath the other, magma rises up through cracks in Earth’s crust. Over
time, erupting magma has formed Vesuvius and its volcanic neighbors.


Many volcanologists, or volcano scientists, consider Vesuvius one
of the world’s most dangerous volcanoes. Why? Vesuvius has been one
of Europe’s most active volcanoes. It is within a few miles of several
large Italian cities. A major eruption could threaten the lives of at least
3 million people.


Scientists monitor Vesuvius closely. They have placed dozens of
**sensors** on the sides of the mountain. If you hiked to the crater on
Vesuvius’s top, you would see some of these sensors along the trail.
The sensors record the mountain’s slightest movement. Any unusual
shaking can be a sign that an eruption is coming. The sensors also
record information about the hot gases rising from the volcano’s crater.
A change in these gases is also a sign of trouble.

**People living around the Bay of Naples must live with the threat of a Vesuvius eruption.**


Scientists analyze sensor data 24 hours a day. They issue a warning if
the data suggests an eruption is brewing. When this happens, people living
around the Bay of Naples are urged to **evacuate** . Scientists worry, however,
that there might not be enough time for thousands of people to get a safe
distance away from the volcano. Vesuvius has a history of erupting very
suddenly.


Vesuvius’s last eruption occurred in 1944. For nearly two weeks, the
volcano released billowing clouds of ash and gas. Fountains of lava shot
up from the volcano’s crater. Yet this eruption was minor compared to the
eruption in 79 AD. It was the largest, most devastating Vesuvius eruption in
recorded history. Millions of tons of hot ash and volcanic rock buried several
ancient Roman towns at the volcano’s base. As many as 16,000 people died.


The 79 AD eruption of Vesuvius happened almost 2,000 years ago. Yet we
know a great deal about it because of evidence left behind. Part of the evidence
is an eyewitness account. A 17-year-old Roman known as Pliny the Younger
lived through the disaster and wrote about it in a letter.


92


**Eyewitness to Disaster**

In the summer of 79 AD, Pliny and his mother were staying with
his uncle. They lived in Misenum, a town at the northern edge of the
Bay of Naples. Misenum was about 20 miles from Vesuvius. They could
see Vesuvius across the bay.


On an August afternoon, Pliny’s mother noticed a strange cloud
forming across the bay. Pliny described it in his letter:


_“The cloud was rising from a mountain that we later learned was_
_Vesuvius. Its shape was a pine tree. It rose into the sky on a trunk that_
_seemed to have branches.”_


What Pliny and his mother saw was the first stage of Vesuvius’s
eruption. Hot gas from deep inside the volcano had erupted, sending
a gigantic column of ash and volcanic rock blasting up into the air.
At its top, the cloud was spreading outward. It created a shape like a
mushroom or umbrella—or in Pliny’s imagination, an Italian pine tree.


**A Vesuvius eruption depicted in a wood engraving**
93


While his uncle sailed across the bay to investigate, Pliny stayed
behind with his mother. Earthquakes shook the ground again and
again. Ash and smoke filled the air. By morning, the sky was still dark.
The air was so thick with volcanic ash that sunlight was blocked. Ash
fell like snow from the sky. Pliny and his mother decided to head for
the hills above Misenum. They were joined by a crowd of **panicked**,
terrified people from the town.


From the hillside above the town, Pliny looked back across the
bay toward Vesuvius. The towering pine-tree-shaped cloud above the
volcano was still there, but had turned black. Lightning and **sheets** of
orange flame flickered inside it. Then, as Pliny watched, the gigantic
cloud seemed to collapse. It fell from the sky and swept down the side
of the volcano. Part of it surged out over the water of the bay and rolled
toward them. Pliny grabbed his mother’s hand and tugged her farther
up the hillside. He wrote:


_“A dense cloud came up behind us. It spread over the earth.”_


**Towering black cloud forms over Vesuvius**

94


Have you ever been in a room with no windows when the lights
went out? That is how Pliny described the darkness. He and his mother
crouched down, afraid to move because they couldn’t see anything at
all. He described the scene:


_“Ashes began to fall again, this time in heavy showers. We shook_
_them off, otherwise we would have been buried beneath them.”_


Time dragged. Pliny
was sure he was going to
die. Then gradually, the
darkness lifted. The ashfall
slowed and eventually
stopped. He saw that
everything around him was
covered in drifts of volcanic
ash. He was sure the worst
was over.


A few days later, Pliny
and his mother learned that
his uncle was dead. He had
died trying to help evacuate
people from Pompeii, a
nearby city.



**Darkness surrounds the erupting Vesuvius**



What about the towns
around the bottom of the
volcano? Pompeii and other
towns at the volcano’s base
were gone, completely
buried under volcanic ash
and rock.


95


**Buried Evidence**

Pliny’s letter gave scientists important clues about Vesuvius’s
eruption in 79 AD. The buried towns, and in particular Pompeii,
provided even more information. It took hundreds of years, however,
to unearth them. In 1748, people looking for Roman artifacts began
digging near what had been Pompeii.


As shovels cut into
the soft volcanic rock,
the diggers discovered
that volcanic ash had
preserved Pompeii.
Buildings were still
standing. Streets were
still **littered** with objects
people had dropped
as they tried to escape.
Inside homes, loaves of
bread and food inside
clay jars were still


The remains of some living things were also eerily recognizable. As
the volcanic cloud swept down from Vesuvius, hot volcanic ash covered
people and animals in seconds. They were **entombed** where they had
fallen.


Excavations continue at Pompeii. Herculaneum, another town
buried by Vesuvius in 79 AD, has also been uncovered. Workers have
restored many of the houses, temples, and streets in these towns. They
have cleaned and repaired paintings, sculptures, and mosaics. If you
visit Pompeii and Herculaneum, you can walk down ancient Roman
streets that look much like they did the day before the volcanic disaster.

96


You can see where children your
age played games, ate their meals,
and slept. You can look out ancient
windows and see Vesuvius, still
active, high above the towns.

**Details of the Disaster**

Scientists have pieced together
a detailed account of the event.
When Vesuvius erupted, it created
the enormous cloud that Pliny saw.
Hot volcanic material rained down
from this cloud onto Pompeii and
other nearby towns. Hot ash fell
and accumulated into piles on the

in the towns at the volcano’s base **Pompeii**
apparently survived the ashfall. Some fled on foot or in boats. Most of
the people stayed and returned to their homes. Scientists suspect they
thought the worst was over. They were wrong.


The towering cloud that hung above Vesuvius collapsed. Pliny
witnessed it from his position across the bay. As millions of tons of hot
volcanic materials dropped toward Earth, they gained speed, creating
what scientists call **pyroclastic flows** . A pyroclastic flow is a sort of
avalanche of intensely hot ash, rock fragments, and volcanic gas. It rolls
down the side of a volcano as fast as a speeding train.


When Vesuvius’s pyroclastic flows hit Pompeii and Herculaneum,
there was no time for people to react. In seconds, these volcanic
avalanches swallowed up everything in their path. They preserved a
moment in time. It was a terrifying moment for the towns’ inhabitants.
For us, it is a unique glimpse into a world long ago.

**Plinian Eruptions**

The most powerful volcanic eruptions produce an enormous
cloud of ash, bits of rock, and toxic gas. The cloud shoots
skyward at hundreds of feet per second. This **eruption column**,
as scientists call it, can soar several dozen miles into the air. At

In the early 1970s, scientists took water samples along other midocean ridges. Time and again, they found places where the seawater was
unexpectedly warm. The scientists dredged up rocks from these sites.
Most were dark volcanic basalt. A few rocks, however, were brightly
colored. The scientists analyzed these colored rocks. They discovered
that the rocks had started out as basalt but their minerals had changed.
The changes were characteristic of rocks exposed to very hot water.


101


Was hot water from hydrothermal vents what had changed the
rocks? The scientists suspected it was. They guessed that as magmaheated seawater rises up through cracks in oceanic crust, it heats the
basalt around it. The heat changes minerals in the basalt. Furthermore,
some of those minerals dissolve in the hot water. As the hot water
erupts from the seafloor, these dissolved minerals turn solid again and
leave the water to mix with seafloor sediments.


At this point, the scientists were convinced that hydrothermal
vents existed on mid-ocean ridges. The next step was to find one.

**The Search Begins**

Scientists headed into the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans aboard
research ships. They sailed along mid-ocean ridges. They lowered
instruments to measure water temperature and dredged up rocks. At
sites that looked promising, they sent down small robots with cameras
to snap pictures of the scene far below. Some photos showed mounds
of rock covered with mineral deposits. Were these warm, mineral-rich
sites the hydrothermal vents they were looking for? To be sure, they
needed to get a firsthand look.


At the time, there were only a few underwater vehicles that could
carry people all the way to the seafloor. These small submersibles
belonged to the military. They were designed to retrieve objects from
the ocean bottom and help rescue sailors trapped in sunken ships.
Many people thought using submersibles for ocean exploration
would be a waste of time and money. Even so, the scientists looking
for hydrothermal vents eventually won support for a joint FrenchAmerican expedition. It was called Project FAMOUS for FrenchAmerican Mid-Ocean Undersea Study. Its destination was the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge.


102


The expedition was a huge **undertaking** . It took two years to get
everything ready. Three submersibles took part, including one called
_Alvin_ . In 1974, a handful of lucky scientists became the first people to
come face-to-face with a mid-ocean ridge. They saw great mounds of
volcanic rock. They even saw the narrow rift along the top of the ridge
where lava erupts to cause new crust to form. However, they didn’t see a
single hydrothermal vent.

**Galapagos Luck**

The scientists were disappointed but didn’t give up. Another team
decided to look for vents along the Galapagos Rift. This is a mid-ocean
ridge west of Central America. Data gathered by instruments and
cameras revealed both warm water and mineral deposits at several sites
along this ridge.


103


_**Alvin**_


104


The Galapagos Hydrothermal Expedition began in early February 1977.
The science team had many instruments, but just one submersible: _Alvin_ .
The expedition began with scientists lowering a camera-equipped vehicle
down near the seafloor. For many hours, they towed the little vehicle over
the ridge. It snapped a picture every few seconds.


The scientists studied the photos carefully. It took a long time because
there were 3,000 photos! Nearly all showed only barren volcanic rock, but
13 photos made the scientists’ hearts beat faster. The photos were taken
at a place on the ridge where the temperature was higher. They clearly
showed rocks covered with mineral deposits. Nestled among the rocks were
hundreds of large white clams. Were the animals there because the water was
warm? Were they clustered around a hydrothermal vent?


On February 17, 1977, _Alvin_ headed down to the site. A pilot and two
scientists sat cramped together inside the small submersible. When the
sub reached the ridge, the men stared out through small **portholes** at an
amazing sight. Jets of hot, shimmering water were gushing out of cracks in
the rock. As it mixed with cold water, the hot vent water instantly turned
cloudy as dissolved minerals solidified. Tiny mineral particles fell like snow.



They had done it! The scientists had
followed the clues to a major discovery.
For the first time, they had located a
hydrothermal vent along a mid-ocean
ridge. Along with the vent, they had also
discovered unexpected life. Seeing big
white clams in a photograph was one
thing. Seeing them in person was much
more exciting. The clams around the
vent were huge, unlike any clams the
scientists had ever seen.



**Mussels, crabs, and shrimp live along**
**hydrothermal vents.**


105


**Communities of animals live off bacteria and**
**bacteria-eaters around hydrothermal vents.**


106


**The Big Surprise**

In the months and years that followed, scientists found many more
hydrothermal vents. Bizarre animals lived around most of them. What
were the animals doing there? How did they survive in a world of total
darkness with only rock, minerals, and hot water? Research provided
the answer, and the answer shocked the world.


On or near Earth’s surface, most living things depend on sunlight
as the ultimate source of energy. Green plants and algae use sunlight to
make food. They do this through a process called photosynthesis. Many
animals eat plants or algae. Other animals eat plant-eaters.


Sunlight doesn’t reach the seafloor, so how do vent dwellers
survive? Scientists discovered the animals survive thanks to bacteria.
Vents are home to unusual types of bacteria that use chemicals in hot
vent water—instead of sunlight—to make food. The process is called
chemosynthesis. Around hydrothermal vents, chemosynthetic bacteria
are like plants and algae in the sunlit world above. Some vent animals
eat the bacteria directly. Others eat the bacteria-eaters. It is a deep-sea
food chain scientists didn’t know existed until 1977. Finding deep-sea
hydrothermal vents—and their communities of animals—was one of
the most important discoveries of the 1900s.
