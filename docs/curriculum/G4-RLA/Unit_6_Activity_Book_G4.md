**Excerpts from “The Man on the Island”**

_Read each excerpt from “The Man on the Island” and then answer the question(s) that follow_
_it._


At first, Treasure Island seemed a fascinating place. There were marshes full of

willows and odd, outlandish, swampy plants and trees. Here and there I saw snakes,

and one raised his head from a rock and hissed at me with a noise not unlike that of a

spinning a top. I explored for a while until I wandered into a thicket of live oak trees,

which grew along the sand.


1. Why do you think the narrator describes Treasure Island as “a fascinating place”?


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **65**


All of a sudden, he was interrupted. Faraway out in the marsh arose an angry

roar, then another. Tom jumped at the sound, like a horse pricked by a rider’s spurs,

but Silver winked not an eye. He stood resting lightly on his crutch, watching his

companion, like a snake about to strike.


_This question has two parts. Answer Part A and then answer Part B._


2. **Part A** : There are two similes in the passage. Underline each one.


**Part B** : Choose one of the similes and explain the comparison it makes.

The figure flitted from trunk to trunk like a deer, but it ran on two legs like a

man. I was tempted to cry for help, when another sighting reassured me that the

creature was indeed a man. I took some comfort in this discovery, and in the fact I

had just remembered I carried a pistol in my pocket. I put one hand on my pistol and

took a few steps forward. At that precise moment, the man leaped out in the open,

threw himself on his knees, and held out his hands as if begging for mercy.


I could see that he was an Englishman like myself, but his clothes were old and

tattered, and his skin had been burned by the sun. In fact, his bright eyes looked quite

startling on a face so burned.


“Who are you?” I demanded.


“I’m Ben Gunn, I am,” he replied. His voice sounded like a rusty lock. “I haven’t

spoken with a man for three years! I am surprised I still know how to speak.”


3. What about Ben Gunn might suggest to Jim Hawkins that he is an Englishman?


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **67**


4. The narrator describes Ben Gunn’s voice as sounding “like a rusty lock.” How does
this simile help support the description of Ben Gunn?


“Well, now, Jim,” he said. “If I ever get back to England, I’m changing my ways

and the company I keep. I’m a changed man.


“And, Jim . . .” he continued, looking around and lowering his voice to little more

than a whisper. “I’m rich! You’ll thank your lucky stars, you will, that you was the first

that found me!”


5. Foreshadowing is a technique authors use to give a warning or suggestion of events to
come before those events happen. How might Ben Gunn’s statement that he is rich be
an example of foreshadowing? What might this mean?

After talking with Ben Gunn for a few minutes, I no longer feared him. In fact, I

told him the story of our voyage, and he heard it with the keenest of interest.


“Well,” he said, “you and your friends are in a pinch, ain’t you? Well, never you

mind. Just put your trust in Ben Gunn. But tell me one thing—is this squire of yours

an honest man?”


6. What do you think the phrase “in a pinch” means in this context?

**The Escape from the** _**Hispaniola**_

(As told by Dr. Livesey)


1 _Much of_ Treasure Island _, by Robert Louis Stevenson, is narrated from the first-person_
_point of view of young Jim Hawkins. However, many events occur when the narrator_
_is not around. For example, while Jim is exploring the island, the other crew members_
_are embarking on adventures of their own. In the story that follows, Dr. Livesey is the_
_narrator. He explains what happened to him and the other men while Jim was off_
_exploring the island._


2 It was about half-past one when the _Hispaniola_ reached Treasure Island. Thirteen men
were to go ashore and six were to remain on the _Hispaniola_ . Shortly afterward, we
learned that Jim Hawkins had sneaked into a boat and gone ashore. It never occurred
to us to doubt Jim, but we were worried about him. We were not sure we would ever
see him again.


3 Hunter, one of the squire’s men, and I decided to go ashore as well. We steered a small
rowboat ashore and discovered a stockade. I recognized that it would be a splendid
fortress if ever we needed one. An abundant spring flowed with fresh water and small
holes dotted the walls for weapons. It would be easy to defend the place against an
entire regiment of experienced soldiers.


4 While we were inspecting the stockade, Hunter and I heard a blood-curdling scream.
It was the anguished cry of a man who had been injured seriously. My first thought
was, “Jim Hawkins is gone!”


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **127**


5 Hunter and I ran to the small boat and rowed back to the _Hispaniola_ . The squire and
the others had heard the cry, as well, and were all shaken.


6 It became evident that we could no longer stay onboard with the pirates. We
determined that it would be in our best interest to relocate to the stockade Hunter and
I had discovered.


7 We set up Redruth, another of the squire’s men, as a guard. We provided him with
three loaded muskets and a mattress for protection. Hunter brought the landing boat
’round under the stern, and I loaded her with powder, muskets, bags of biscuits, kegs
of pork, my medicine chest, and other essential supplies. Then, all the remaining good
gentlemen climbed aboard and we shoved off.


8 The small boat was gravely overloaded. Onboard were five grown men, and three of
them—Squire Trelawney, Redruth, and the captain—were over six feet tall. Several
times we took on a little water, and my breeches and the tails of my coat were soaking
wet before we had gone a hundred yards.


9 Besides sinking, we were worried about one other possible danger—the cannons on
the _Hispaniola_ . The pirates did not have muskets, but they might well fire one of the
cannons. We had heard that Israel Hands was Captain Flint’s gunner. We kept an eye
peeled on the ship and soon noticed that they were, in fact, preparing to fire upon us.


10 “Trelawney,” barked the captain. “Stop these men. Israel Hands, if possible.”


11 Trelawney was as cool as steel. He calmly primed his gun.


12 “Careful!” said the captain. “We mustn’t swamp the boat.”


13 The squire raised his gun. The rowing ceased and we leaned over the other side to
keep the balance. Trelawney fired, but we had no luck. He had missed Israel Hands.


14 The other pirates were too preoccupied with priming the cannon to notice the shot.


15 Suddenly, boom! The cannon fired.

16 The ball passed over our heads. We ducked, and our sudden movement caused the
boat to rock and tip to one side. Water began to gush into the boat. It sank by the
stern, quite gently, in three feet of water. Since the water was shallow, we were able to
stand up and rescue some of our supplies. We carried the supplies over our heads to
keep them dry and waded ashore as fast as we could, leaving the small boat behind,
along with half of our powder and provisions.


17 To add to our concern, we heard voices drawing near us in the woods along the shore.
We figured it must be Silver and his crew. We soon realized that we were in danger of
being cut off from the stockade. At the same time, I was wondering about poor Jim’s
fate, when suddenly I heard a voice from the land side.


18 “Doctor! Squire! Captain! Hello, Hunter, is that you?” came the cries.


19 I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins, safe and sound, climbing over the
stockade.

**Pirates, Parrots, and Pieces of Eight**


1 _Treasure Island_ seems to have inspired some popular beliefs about pirates and piracy.
However, some of the story’s details about pirates are accurate and others are not.
Each of the following sections introduces historic or scientific evidence to set straight
common myths and misunderstandings about pirates and piracy. Each section also
explains which details about pirates and piracy could have been accurate in _Treasure_
_Island_ .

**Parrots**


2 One of the most well-known characters from _Treasure Island_ is Long John Silver’s
parrot, Captain Flint. The talkative bird has become so iconic that many people
believe every pirate had a parrot. Some people think of parrots as the symbolic pet for
pirates. Historians say that was probably not the case. It would have been difficult to
carry a parrot with you everywhere, as Long John Silver did. Also, when pirates’ food
ran out, a parrot might have been in danger of becoming something other than a pet!


3 However, many details about parrots in the story are accurate. Parrots are intelligent
and really can learn to repeat single words and short phrases. If a pirate did have a pet
parrot, it might have learned to mimic a phrase like “pieces of eight.”


4 Parrots are native to tropical areas. Many varieties are found in Central and South
America. There are more than 350 species of parrots in warm climates all over the
world. It is thus possible they would be native to the Spanish Main.


5 Parrots typically live 30 to 50 years, but some species live more than 80 years. That’s not
quite the 200 years old Captain Flint was said to be, but still a long lifespan for a pet.


**Pieces of Eight**


6 “Pieces of eight” were Spanish coins made of silver. They were first created a few years
after Christopher Columbus landed in the Americas. Each piece of silver was worth
eight reales (Spanish coins), which is why they were called “pieces of eight.” Reference
to “pieces of eight” in _Treasure Island_ is thus historically accurate.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 6** **133**


7 The Spanish conquistadors who came after Columbus conquered much of South
America. In Peru and elsewhere, they set up large silver mines. They had the native
people dig out the silver ore. Then they melted the ore down to make coins—coins
that pirates were eager to steal!


8 Although Spain issued pieces of eight, people in many other countries used them, too.
The silver they contained was valuable, so people were willing to accept the coins as
payment. People used pieces of eight in the United States until 1854—just before the
Civil War.


9 The United States began minting its own coins in the 1790s. They stamped pieces
of metal, creating coins similar to pieces of eight. Back then, a U.S. dollar was worth
“eight bits.” Two bits were equal to a quarter. Later, the United States switched to a
monetary system in which a dollar represented one hundred cents. However, people
continued referring to “bits” even after the new system was introduced.


**Pirates**


10 Pirates were much more interested in loot than in taking prisoners or fighting others.
The amount and kind of violence was likely different from the violence in _Treasure_
_Island_ . Instead of fighting violently, pirates generally held prisoners for ransom or
marooned them. Pirates often set captured crews free with their ships after stealing
their goods.


11 The so-called golden age of piracy began in the 1500s, during the reign of Queen
Elizabeth I. This golden age lasted until the early 1800s. Around that time, the
United States and European navies ended the practice. The time period during which
_Treasure Island_ was set probably coincided with the golden age of piracy. Thus, the
timing in the story could have been accurate. However, contrary to how piracy was
portrayed in _Treasure Island_, it was not a fun and adventurous way of life. It was
actually a serious business, not something a young boy like Jim Hawkins would have
wanted to be part of.
