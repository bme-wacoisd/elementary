**French and Indian War**

In the treaty, France agreed to give up almost all of the land it had
claimed in North America. The French handed over control of this land
to Great Britain. However, with new land came new responsibilities and
financial **burdens** .

**Taxes**

The British government had borrowed a lot of money to fight this
war. A lot of that money had been spent on protecting the colonists from
the French and their Native American allies. All of the money had to be
paid back, and the British government felt that the colonists should pay
their share. In addition, more money was continually needed to protect
the colonies as well as the newly acquired land.


To raise the needed funds, the British
government **imposed** new **taxes**, including several
that would have to be paid by the colonists.
In 1765, King George III and his government
proposed the Stamp Act.


The Stamp Act was a tax on printed materials.
Colonists were required to buy stamps when they


**or embossed on paper.**

even playing cards. These were not gummed stamps,
but rather impressions imprinted or embossed on paper. Many people were
upset about the Stamp Act. They thought it was unfair that the king and
his government in London were making decisions about taxes the colonists
had to pay, while the colonists had no say in the matter.


The British government had generally allowed the colonies to
raise taxes themselves. For example, if the government of Virginia
needed money, an **assembly** of representatives from different parts of
Virginia would meet. This assembly was called the House of Burgesses.
Members of the House of Burgesses would determine the best way to
raise money. They would propose taxes, and they would vote. If many
representatives thought the taxes were unfair, they would not vote for
them and, therefore, the taxes would not be approved. Because the
House of Burgesses included representatives from different parts of
Virginia, most everyone felt the process was fair.


**5**


Every colony had an assembly similar to the Virginia House of
Burgesses. The assemblies weren’t all called the House of Burgesses, but
they did the same thing: a group of representatives met to discuss new
laws and taxes.


Although the colonists continued to raise their own taxes even after
1765, they felt that, rather than imposing a new tax on the colonies, the
king and his government should have asked these assemblies to find a
way to raise the money that was needed. Instead,
without even as much as a dialogue, the king and
his government created the Stamp Act. They did
not send it to the colonial assemblies, but directly
to Parliament, part of the British government
responsible for passing laws and raising taxes.


**The Stamp Act was** The colonists agreed that there were bills that
**very unpopular.**
had to be paid, and they wanted to contribute.
But they also wanted some say in how the money was raised. They
were concerned that important decisions about taxes were being
made thousands of miles away, by a parliament that had no colonial
representatives. This process didn’t seem fair to them.


Other regions outside of England, such as
Scotland, had representatives in Parliament. Their
job was to represent—and stand up for—the people
of Scotland. But there were no representatives from
the 13 colonies in Parliament. Not even one!



When the colonists became upset about the
Stamp Act, they expressed their unhappiness in
various ways. They held protest meetings. They
wrote pamphlets. They sent **petitions** to London.
They tried to explain why they thought the Stamp
Act was unfair.

**The Stamp Act was**
**seen as an unfair tax.**


**The British Parliament made decisions**
**on laws and taxes, including those that**
**affected the colonies.**


**7**


Many of the colonists were proud British subjects. But they also felt
that they had rights—rights that the king and his government could not
take away. **Opposition** to the Stamp Act spread.


In Virginia, the House of Burgesses passed a motion protesting the
Stamp Act. The burgesses agreed that the British Parliament had no
right to tax the people of Virginia.


~~**Prime Minister Grenville**~~



In 1765, the prime
minister of Great Britain
was George Grenville.
He was the **mastermind**
behind the Stamp Act.
Grenville was faced with
the challenge of finding
money to support the
thousands of British
soldiers stationed in the
North American colonies.
As far as he was concerned,
the British soldiers were
protecting the colonists,
so the colonists should
help pay for the soldiers.



**George Grenville**



At first, the British government was surprised by the colonists’
response to the Stamp Act. As prime minister, Grenville remained
unsympathetic to the colonial complaints and protests. However, he
did not have widespread support, and other government ministers
criticized him. He was replaced as prime minister in 1766.

~~**A Leader Emerges**~~

George Washington fought in the French and Indian War
alongside the British. He served as a major and led a group of **militia**
against the French in the Ohio River Valley. As a result of a successful
mission against a French scouting party, Washington was promoted
to colonel. He became the commander of a group of soldiers from
Virginia and North Carolina. Although his next mission was not as
successful, Washington had made a name for himself as a valiant
leader. In 1755, he became the commander of all the Virginia
militiamen. He was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1758.

# ~~**Trouble Is**~~ **Brewing**



**THE BIG QUESTION**
Who were the Sons of
Liberty, and what form
of protest did they lead
in Boston Harbor?



Some of the most passionate protests against the Stamp Act
took place in Boston, Massachusetts. There, angry crowds took their
frustration out on tax collectors.


A new group of protestors formed in Boston in response to the
Stamp Act. The group met under a tree that they called the **Liberty**
Tree. They made public speeches against taxes and the British
government. They cried, “No taxation without representation!” This
group became known as the Sons of Liberty.


Eventually, after much protest, the British government decided
to **repeal** the Stamp Act in 1766. Parliament **eliminated** the tax on
paper products, but in 1767
it replaced it with other
taxes—including taxes on
imported goods, such as tea.
These taxes were officially


**10**


Tea was a popular drink in the colonies, just as it was in Great
Britain. However, many people decided they would not buy British tea
if they had to pay an unfair tax. And they thought the new tax on tea
was every bit as unfair as the old tax on paper. After all, the new tax had
been approved by the same British Parliament in London, and there
were still no representatives from the 13 colonies there.


Suddenly, deciding to take a sip of tea meant something more
than just having a drink. If you bought British tea, you were paying a
tax, and, **indirectly**, you were agreeing that Parliament had the right
to tax the colonies. On the other hand, if you refused to buy British
tea, you were making a statement of a different kind: you were saying
that you did not approve of—and would not accept—taxation without
representation.


Colonists who were angry about the new tax agreed not to buy
British tea. But they didn’t stop there. They also visited inns and other
places that sold tea and asked the owners to stop selling it. Many
establishments agreed to **boycott** British tea.


**11**


In 1768, in response to the protests about the new taxes, the British
government sent soldiers to Boston to keep an eye on the Sons of
Liberty. Because the British soldiers wore red uniforms, the colonists
sometimes referred to them as “redcoats” or “lobster backs.”


In March 1770, several Bostonians got into a tussle with a redcoat.
The Bostonians surrounded the soldier and called him names. They
threw snowballs at him, and some members of the crowd even
threatened him with sticks and clubs.


More British soldiers arrived on the scene. They ordered the
Bostonians to go home, but the angry protestors refused. The situation
became more serious when even more people poured into the
streets. Soon a crowd of 300 angry Bostonians was pressing in on the
outnumbered British soldiers.


**12**


Some of the Bostonians shouted at the soldiers, daring them to fire
their guns. One of the Bostonians threw something at the soldiers. It
may have been a snowball. It may have been a rock. Whatever it was,
it hit one of the soldiers and knocked him down. Perhaps thinking his
life was in danger, the soldier fired his **musket** . One of the Bostonians
fought back, attacking the soldier with a club. After that, the other
British soldiers responded. They fired into the crowd. When it was over,
five people were dead.


The Sons of Liberty were outraged. They began making speeches
about the incident, which became known as the Boston Massacre. They
insisted that the Bostonians had been protesting peacefully and the
British had no reason to fire on them. One of the Sons of Liberty, a man
named Paul Revere, created an **engraving** that showed British soldiers
firing into a crowd of peaceful protestors. It was not an entirely **accurate**
picture of what had happened, but many colonists thought it was.


**Paul Revere’s engraving of the event that became known as the Boston Massacre**


**13**


**The World’s Largest Tea Party**

In December 1773, there was another incident in Boston. Three
ships loaded with tea were docked in Boston Harbor. The captains had
orders to unload the tea so it could be sold in Boston.


The Sons of Liberty refused to let this happen. They had spent a
lot of time convincing the people of Boston not to buy or sell British tea.
There was no way they were going to let the captains unload all that tea.
The Sons of Liberty demanded the captains raise anchor and sail away.


The captains weren’t sure what to do, so they did not do anything.
The ships sat in the harbor until the Sons of Liberty finally decided
to get rid of the tea once and for all. Dressed as Native Americans,
they and other members of the **patriot** movement boarded the ships
and threw the tea into Boston Harbor. They dumped approximately
340 chests of tea—worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in today’s
money—into the Atlantic Ocean. Later, this act of protest came to be
known as the Boston Tea Party.

~~**Phillis Wheatley**~~

When the Stamp Act was repealed,
many people in the colonies were delighted.
Some people wrote articles, letters, and songs
expressing their gratitude. One woman,
named Phillis Wheatley, wrote a poem. Phillis

on a ship that transported enslaved people. She was
taken to work in the home of a merchant named John Wheatley.
The Wheatleys taught her to read and write. Eventually, she began to
write poetry. A book of her poems was published in 1773. Her poem
to King George became one of her best-known works:

_**To the King’s Most Excellent Majesty 1768**_

_YOUR subjects hope, dread Sire—_
_The crown upon your brows may flourish long,_
_And that your arm may in your God be strong!_
_O may your sceptre num’rous nations sway,_
_And all with love and readiness obey!_
_But how shall we the British king reward!_
_Rule thou in peace, our father, and our lord!_
_Midst the remembrance of thy favours past,_
_The meanest peasants most admire the last*_

_May George, beloved by all the nations round,_
_Live with heav’ns choicest constant blessings crown’d!_
_Great God, direct, and guard him from on high,_
_And from his head let ev’ry evil fly!_
_And may each clime with equal gladness see_
_A monarch’s smile can set his subjects free!_

~~**Crispus Attucks**~~

Crispus Attucks was among the people
killed during the Boston Massacre. Attucks
was part African and part Native American.
He had been enslaved, but at the time of the
Boston Massacre he was a sailor. During the
crossfire, Attucks was shot in the chest and

a fourth, also died as a result of the incident in **Crispus Attucks**
Boston. On the day of the funerals, many shops closed. Thousands
of people filed through the streets of Boston following the victims’
coffins. Attucks and the others became heroes.


~~**The Sons of Liberty**~~

The Sons of Liberty was largely made up of small business
owners. Several were merchants and tradesmen. The group got its
name from an Irishman named Isaac Barre. Barre was a soldier and a

fought in the French and Indian War. He was
involved in the defeat of the French at the
Battle of Québec. He was strongly opposed
to the taxes that were being imposed on
the colonists. In one of his speeches, Barre
referred to the colonists as Sons of Liberty.
The name inspired some of the protestors in

the Sons of Liberty ever since. **Isaac Barre**


**17**


When news of the Boston Tea Party reached Great Britain in 1774,
many people were shocked. Many members of the British government
were furious. They made a decision to punish the people of Boston.


Over the next few months, Parliament approved a series of new
laws. The Boston Port Act declared that Boston Harbor would remain
closed until the colonists paid for the tea that had been destroyed. No
ships were allowed to enter or leave without British permission.


The Massachusetts Government Act declared that the people of
the colony were now under stricter control in terms of meetings and
electing their own officials. From that point on, the British king and his
ministers would make all decisions about which colonists would serve
in important positions in Massachusetts.


The Administration of Justice Act made new rules for trials.
Bostonians accused of a crime would no longer be tried in Boston by
fellow Bostonians. Instead, they would be sent either to another colony,
such as Canada, or even to London. They would also be tried in a
special Admiralty court by a judge handpicked by the king.


The Quartering Act declared that the colonists had to provide
quarters, or temporary places to live, for the British soldiers stationed
in the colonies. The colonists also had to provide supplies such as food,
bedding, candles, and firewood. This was significant because the British
government was getting ready to send more soldiers to Boston.


**Members of the First Continental Congress gather at Carpenters’ Hall in Philadelphia**


**20**


The people of Massachusetts were very angry about these new
laws. How could they make a living if goods could not be shipped in
or out of Boston? How would they get a fair trial if they were sent to
faraway courts? And how could they trust the government if all of the
top officials were selected by the king? The Bostonians called these new
laws the **Intolerable** Acts. They would not stand for them!


News did not travel fast back then. People did not have television,
cell phones, or e-mail. But when people in other colonies heard about
the events unfolding in Massachusetts, they became alarmed. Some
were angry, too. They thought the same could happen to them! Twelve
of the 13 colonies decided to send representatives to a meeting in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, known as the First Continental Congress.
The First Continental Congress met in September 1774. Of the 13
colonies, only Georgia did not attend.


**21**


**Complaints and Grievances**

The 56 members of the First Continental Congress drafted a list of
complaints and **grievances** against the king and his government. They
agreed that all 13 colonies would stop **importing** goods from Great
Britain—not just tea and other items that were taxed, but all British
goods. They also agreed that, unless Parliament repealed the Intolerable
Acts, the colonies would stop **exporting** colonial goods to Great Britain.


Some colonists began to think a war was unavoidable. They
thought it was time to start **stockpiling** muskets and gunpowder.
Others believed that it was not too late to patch up relations with the
king and his government.


Representatives from Virginia debated this issue in March 1775.
Several representatives argued that Virginia should do whatever it
could to keep the peace and restore good relations with the king. But
others felt that it was too late for that. A country lawyer named Patrick
Henry proposed that it was time to stop talking about peace and to start
fighting for liberty:


Many people in Massachusetts agreed with Patrick Henry. They were
organizing militias, stockpiling guns, and preparing to fight. Some of the
Massachusetts militiamen were known as minutemen. These special troops
were created to be ready to fight at a moment’s notice!


**22**


The British government knew that these preparations were
underway. In response, they sent a large army to Boston. British
generals were told to confiscate any weapons they could find. They
were also told to find and arrest the biggest troublemakers among the
Sons of Liberty—Samuel Adams and John Hancock.


In April 1775, the British tried to capture some weapons that
members of the patriot movement had hidden in Concord, west of
Boston. Approximately 700 British soldiers marched out of Boston on
the night of April 18, hoping to surprise the militia in Concord. But the
patriots were watching every move the British soldiers made.


**The Night Rider**

One of the men keeping an eye on the British was Paul
Revere. He had heard that the British soldiers were getting
ready to march out to Concord. He knew there were only two
ways to get to Concord from Boston. One was to march there
on foot. The other was to cross the Charles River in boats
and then march the rest of the way. It was not possible to tell
which way the British would go until they set out. Revere
came up with a clever plan. He told a friend to hang lanterns
in the **belfry** of the North Church in Boston. If the soldiers
left Boston on foot, Revere’s comrade was to hang one lantern;
if they set off in boats, he was to hang two lanterns.


**Lantern** On the night of April 18, 1775, Revere’s friend ran up to
the belfry and hung two lanterns. Then, Revere and several other patriots
jumped into action. Revere got into a rowboat and rowed across the
Charles River—right past a British warship! Once he made it across, he
jumped onto a horse and set off along the same road the soldiers would
be taking. Paul Revere and other riders, including William Dawes and
Samuel Prescott, rode through the night to awaken the sleeping colonists.


Paul Revere, well-known for the popular cry, “The British are
coming!” never actually spoke those words, let alone yelled them
into the darkness. Today, historians believe it is more likely he quietly
warned colonists, “The regulars are coming out!” Paul Revere never
made it to Concord that night. But he did ride to Lexington to warn
Samuel Adams and John Hancock, who were wanted by the British and
in hiding there.


Because of Revere and the other riders, people who lived along the
road knew the British soldiers were headed toward Concord. Hundreds of
minutemen grabbed their guns and prepared to defend their homeland.


**24**


**This painting of Paul Revere’s ride was created more**
**than 100 years after the night of April 18, 1775. The**
**scene depicted is not an entirely accurate account of**
**what happened. However it does convey the tension**
**and drama of the events that took place that night.**



**25**


**The Shot Heard ’Round the World**

It was April 19, 1775. In Lexington, a town on the road to Concord,
80 militiamen lined up in formation. They had their guns with them,
but they were not planning to fire on the redcoats. After all, a war had
not been declared. Still, they knew there was a chance fighting might
break out, and they wanted to be ready if it did.


As the British approached, John Parker, the leader of the Lexington
militia, told his men, “Stand your ground; don’t fire unless fired upon,
but if they mean to have a war, let it begin here.”


A British officer told the armed men to go home. According to one
report, he shouted, “Lay down your arms, you **rebels** !” However, as the
militiamen were turning to go, a shot rang out.


Who fired that shot? Even today nobody knows for sure. The
British soldiers thought the militiamen fired it. However, Parker and
his men said later that they did not. The shot may have been fired by
someone who was not part of Parker’s militia. He may have been firing
into the air to sound an alarm. In any case, the soldiers thought they
were under attack. They fired a **volley** and—in a matter of seconds—
guns were flashing and smoking on both sides.


**26**


**Battle of Lexington**


**27**


Seven members of the militia were killed in Lexington that day,
and nine more were wounded. On the other side, only one British
soldier was wounded.


Next, the British soldiers marched on to Concord. They searched
Concord and found a few cannons and some **musket balls** . By this
time, word of the fighting was spreading rapidly. Hundreds of men

~~**Two Very Important Patriots**~~

**Samuel Adams**

In 1765, Samuel Adams was elected
to the Massachusetts colonial assembly
and became the leader of opposition to
the British government. As a delegate
to the First and Second Continental
Congress, Adams fought for colonial
independence. Though Harvard-educated,
Adams was not part of the social elite who **Samuel Adams**
typically held government positions at the time. Several of Adams’s
acquaintances helped to give him a gentlemanly appearance, more
befitting a political leader of the time. For his first trip to Philadelphia,
one friend provided him with financial assistance and another gave
him the outfit he wore to the meeting.

**John Hancock**

John Hancock’s name tops the list of signatures on the
Declaration of Independence. His prominent signature is familiar

the American Revolution. Following the
Boston Massacre in 1770, John Hancock
was one of the committee members
chosen to go to the governor to demand
the removal of British troops from the

**John Hancock**

**30**


**John Ward Dunsmore,** _**Bunker Hill (Fight at Rail Fence)**_


**31**


The militia waited . . . and waited . . . and waited. Finally,
they opened fire. **Scores** of British troops fell to the ground.
Surprisingly, the redcoats were forced to retreat. The British
attacked a second time, but again they were beaten back. They
attacked a third time—and this time they were successful.
The militia had run out of ammunition. Now it was _their_ turn
to retreat.


Today this battle is known as the Battle of Bunker Hill.
However, that is an unusual name for a battle that was actually
fought on Breed’s Hill. It is possible that the confusion about
the location of the battle was caused by a lack of familiarity
with the area. The two hills are near each other. In fact, a
British officer who mapped the battle site mixed them up on
his map. It is also possible that Prescott had been ordered to
**fortify** Bunker Hill but fortified Breed’s Hill instead when he
realized that it was the more desirable spot.


In one sense, the Battle of Bunker Hill was a victory for
the British. They achieved their goal: they drove the militia off
the hill. In another sense, it felt more like a defeat. Is it really a
victory if 1,000 men are killed and wounded compared to 500
on the other side? The British knew that they could not afford
to continue to lose so many soldiers, even if the eventual
outcome was a victory!


While the Battle of Bunker Hill was raging outside
Boston, 56 representatives from all 13 colonies attended
the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Thomas
Jefferson came north to represent Virginia. John Adams,
Samuel Adams, and John Hancock made their way south from
Massachusetts. Benjamin Franklin, a native Bostonian living
in Philadelphia, did not have far to travel.

**33**


**A Little Common Sense**


than anyone else to convince people to
declare independence was Thomas
Paine. Paine was an Englishman who
had moved to Philadelphia only a
few months earlier at the suggestion
of Benjamin Franklin. Franklin
thought Paine could help the patriot
movement. Thomas Paine wrote a
pamphlet called _Common Sense_ . It

Second Continental Congress was meeting. **Thomas Paine**


Paine believed that monarchy was a foolish way to run a country.
“Mankind being originally equals in the order of creation,” Paine wrote;
so how could any one man claim the right to rule over millions?


Paine argued that the colonies should separate from Great Britain
and form a republic—a government made up of elected representatives.
He told his new countrymen they had an amazing opportunity—they
could cast off government by kings and replace it with something
much, much better:


**34**


_Common Sense_ became a bestseller. Copies were printed in all 13
colonies. Selections were printed in newspapers. Those who could read
studied the pamphlet. Those who could not read listened while it was
read aloud at an inn or coffeehouse. _Common_ _Sense_ convinced many
colonists that it was, in fact, time to declare independence.

**A Final Separation**

By June 1776, most members of the Second Continental Congress
were ready to vote for what Paine referred to as “a final separation.”
Thomas Jefferson, a delegate from Virginia, was asked to write an
official **declaration** of independence. His job was to explain why
the colonies were breaking away from Great Britain, and why it was
necessary for them to do so.


Benjamin Franklin and John Adams reviewed Jefferson’s draft.
They made a few changes, but overall they accepted Jefferson’s work
without reservation. On July 2, 1776, the members of the Second
Continental Congress voted for independence. On July 4, 1776, the
members voted again—this time on whether to accept Jefferson’s
Declaration of Independence as the document that outlined the reasons
for their desire to be independent. No one voted against it. One colony,
New York, **abstained** . The Declaration of Independence was approved!


**35**


In the first part of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson
wrote specific ideals that he and his fellow colonists wholeheartedly
believed to be true:


_“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are_
_created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with_
_certain unalienable rights that among these are Life, Liberty_
_and the pursuit of Happiness.”_


Jefferson believed that the role of government is to protect these
rights. However, if a government failed to protect these rights—if it
actually took these rights away—then the people had the right to rebel
and set up a new government.


**36**


**John Trumbull,** _**Declaration of Independence**_ **, 1817–1819**


**37**


Jefferson argued that this was what the British government had
done. In the second half of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson
presented a long list of unacceptable actions the British government
had taken. It had **levied** unfair taxes, taken away the right to trial by
jury, and quartered British troops in colonial cities. For all of these
reasons (and more), Jefferson wrote, the colonists had no other option
but to declare independence from Great Britain.


~~**Happy Birthday to Us!**~~

Ever since 1776, the Fourth of July has been a national holiday
in the United States. On this day every year, Americans celebrate
their independence by watching fireworks, singing patriotic songs,
and attending picnics and parades. Although it took another
month to get all the signatures on the Declaration of Independence,
Americans still celebrate Independence Day on July 4.


**Independence Day in Washington, D.C.**


**38**


**No Simple Solution**

The colonists did not initially have a national army ready to fight
on their behalf. The Continental Army, as such, did not yet exist. In
June 1775, the Continental Congress appointed Virginian George
Washington to create such an army. Until then, the army had consisted
of a loosely organized collection of militia units from New England.
The **implications** of what had happened at Lexington and Concord
were far from clear in the days following the battles. While there had
been plenty of outrage, it had taken over a year for independence to
be declared. In fact, after the battles in Lexington and Concord, some
patriots had created a flag called “The Continental Colors.” This flag
featured the red and white stripes from the Sons of Liberty flag with an
image of the British Union Jack superimposed on it, indicating some

**Crossing the Delaware**

Having retreated from Boston, the British turned their attention to
New York City. They recognized the **strategic** importance of this port
city. If their plan to gain control was to succeed, they needed to capture
it. However, George Washington was equally aware of the importance
of having control of New York City. He marched his troops there to
**confront** the British army.


In the summer of 1776, the British and Continental armies engaged
in a battle on Long Island and Manhattan Island. George Washington and
his men failed to keep New York City out of British hands. By November
1776, having lost New York City, George Washington retreated along
the Hudson River and then into New Jersey. Washington knew his army
was simply not as strong as the British army. If he tried to challenge the
British in a major battle, he knew he would lose. He would have to look
for opportunities to attack when his enemies were not expecting it.


On December 25, 1776, that is exactly what Washington did. It was
Christmas night, and the Hessian troops who were camped in Trenton,


New Jersey, had been on round-the-clock alert for over a week. They were
exhausted. Finally, they had been allowed to sleep. Because they were not
expecting an attack on Christmas night, many were unarmed.


Washington crossed the Delaware River from Pennsylvania and
took the Hessians completely by surprise. More than 1,000 of them
were forced to **surrender** in the sneak attack.


The victory at Trenton was extremely good for the **morale**
of Washington’s troops, but it was followed by a string of defeats.
Washington and his men were defeated at the Battle of Brandywine in
September 1777 and again at the Battle of Germantown in October. At
Germantown, some of the soldiers in the Continental Army became
confused and fired on their own troops. Because of these defeats, the
British were able to capture Philadelphia. The Continental Congress
was forced to break up and relocate to another city.


Farther north, a British army marched down from Canada, recaptured
Fort Ticonderoga, and began to close in on the Continental Army fighting
in this area. The Continental Army was in trouble. It was time to retreat
and regroup—but the British were right behind them.


**Outsmarting the Enemy**

The Continental Army also needed a plan. Fortunately, a man
named Tadeusz Kościuszko had one. Kościuszko was a Polish
engineer who had joined the colonists in their fight for independence.
Kościuszko shared certain strategies that the Continental Army might
use to slow down the British army.


At Kościuszko’s suggestion, the Continental soldiers cut down trees
and let them fall across roads as they retreated. They destroyed bridges,
and they built dams so rivers would overflow onto the roads.


These **tactics** gave the soldiers time to set up defenses near
Saratoga, New York. Kościuszko played an important role in that, too.
He suggested the best defensive spots to build forts, thus preventing
the British from continuing south to Albany. He also taught the
Continental soldiers how to build strong defensive walls.


In September 1777, the British attacked the forts near Saratoga.
Despite repeated efforts, they were not able to break through the
Continental Army defenses. On October 17, the British general
surrendered. More than 6,000 British soldiers handed over their weapons.
The Battle of Saratoga was the first big victory for the Continental Army.


In December 1777, Washington and his tired men limped into the
Pennsylvania town of Valley Forge. Washington had decided that his army
would spend the winter there. In those days, armies scaled back fighting
during the winter. That winter, Washington’s army had to face another
enemy—Mother Nature.


Mother Nature was not kind to the Continental Army during the
winter of 1777 to 1778. It was a bitterly cold winter, and the soldiers were
not prepared for it. Most of them did not have winter coats. Many did not
even have shoes. Their injured feet left bloody footprints in the snow.


**44**


**Washington riding through the camp at Valley Forge**


**45**


During December and January, the soldiers cut down trees and
used them to build log cabins. These cabins provided some shelter from
the cold, but they were crowded and damp.


There were other problems, too. The soldiers did not have enough
to eat. They had to survive for many weeks on firecake, a tasteless
mixture of flour and water baked over a fire. Occasionally, they might
have a bowl of pepper pot soup, a thin broth made from beef and a
handful of peppercorns.


Clean drinking water was also in short supply. Many soldiers drank
dirty water and got sick. A few died of frostbite or starvation; many
more died as a result of diseases.


One army surgeon, Albigence Waldo from Connecticut, kept a
diary during his time in Valley Forge. Here is an excerpt from his diary:


George Washington was worried about the state of the army.
On December 23, 1777, he wrote a letter to the Continental Congress
explaining that many of his men were in such poor health that they
were no longer fit for combat. The situation was so bad, Washington
wrote that he was worried that his men might give up and go home:


**46**


As the New Year dawned in 1778, things looked **bleak** for George
Washington and the Continental Army. However, the tide was
beginning to turn in their favor.


**Among Washington’s men at Valley Forge was a young French nobleman named the**
**Marquis de Lafayette. Lafayette was to have a prominent role in the Revolutionary War.**

# ~~**From Valley Forge**~~ **to Yorktown**



**THE BIG QUESTION**
What European
country joined the
Continental Army
to fight the British,
and how did their
help influence the
outcome of the war?



There is a saying, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” The
winter of 1777 to 1778 was a difficult time for Washington and his men.
Those who survived that winter in Valley Forge came to think they
were strong enough to survive just about anything!


In February 1778, the French military entered the war to fight
alongside the Continental Army. France was a longtime enemy of
Great Britain, so they welcomed the opportunity to assist the colonists
in their fight against the British. This was good news for the colonists.
France had a strong, organized military. French involvement meant
help was on the way!


Then, in late February, a man with a heavy German accent arrived
in Valley Forge. His name was Friedrich Wilhelm Ludolf Gerhard
Augustin von Steuben. The purpose for his arrival began during the
previous summer when von Steuben traveled to Paris to volunteer
his services to the Count de St. Germain, the French Minister of
War. St. Germain had been so **impressed** with von Steuben’s military
experience that he sent him across the Atlantic Ocean to meet George
Washington. George Washington was equally impressed and asked von
Steuben to train his soldiers. There was just one problem: von Steuben
knew only a few words of English. So, he shouted his commands in
German, then someone would translate the words into English.

soldiers how to march and stand in
formation. He taught them how
to advance on the battlefield. He
also taught them how to use the
**bayonets** attached to their muskets.
Von Steuben trained a **model**
**company** . Then, the members
of this model company trained
other companies.


Things began to improve in
the spring of 1778. Washington sent
out **foraging** parties to gather cattle, horses, **Friedrich Wilhelm**

**von Steuben**

corn, hay, and grains from the local people.
They returned with enough food to feed the soldiers at Valley Forge.
Washington also appointed a new quartermaster whose job was to make
sure the army did not run out of food or supplies. And, last but not least,


By the time the Continental Army
marched out of Valley Forge in June
1778, they were much better prepared
to fight as an army. The newly trained
Continental Army began to win more
battles. Their first **decisive** victory came
in the fall of 1781. At this point, much of

**Lord Cornwallis**


**49**


**The Beginning of the End**

In August 1781, Cornwallis and his men camped at Yorktown, at
the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, in Virginia. They were waiting for
reinforcements and supplies.


While Cornwallis was setting up camp at Yorktown, Washington
was meeting with several French generals outside New York City.
The French had sent thousands of troops to assist Washington. Now
Washington and the French generals had to decide how to best utilize
these new troops. Should they attack the British in New York City, or
should they head south and attack Cornwallis in Virginia?


Eventually they decided to march the main Continental Army and
most of the French troops south to Virginia and try to trap Cornwallis.
But Washington was crafty. He sent out fake messages to make the
British think he was actually going to attack New York. The British were
fooled by the messages.


In late September, Washington arrived at Yorktown with 4,000
French soldiers and 3,000 Continental soldiers. The Major General of
the Continental Army was the Marquis de Lafayette. These new soldiers
**reinforced** Lafayette’s men who were already there. The French navy
arrived as well, and one of the first things they did was drive away a
**convoy** of British ships that were carrying supplies for Cornwallis and
his men. That was when Cornwallis knew he was in trouble. He was
cornered by the French and Continental armies, and the French navy
had cut off his escape route as well as his supplies!


The French and Continental armies set up cannons and began
firing on the British. For days the guns fired constantly. Washington
gave orders to fire through the night so the British would not have any
quiet time to rest or make repairs.


Cornwallis and his men could not protect themselves and,
because of the position of the French **fleet**, they could not sail away.
Eventually, on October 19, 1781, Cornwallis accepted that he had no
choice but to surrender.


Thousands of people who lived in nearby towns and villages came
out to watch the official surrender. The Continental Army lined up on
one side of the road and the French on the other. At about two o’clock
in the afternoon, the British army marched between the lines of French
and Continental troops to surrender. James Thatcher of Massachusetts
was present at Yorktown and wrote an account of the surrender:


_“It was about two o’clock when the captive army advanced_
_through the line formed for their reception. Every eye was_
_prepared to gaze on Lord Cornwallis, the object of peculiar_
_interest and solicitude; but he disappointed our anxious_
_expectations; pretending indisposition, he made General_
_O’Hara his substitute as the leader of his army. This officer_
_was followed by the conquered troops in a slow and solemn_
_step, with shouldered arms, colors cased and drums beating a_
_British march.”_

_—James Thatcher_

**John Trumbull,** _**Surrender of Lord Cornwallis**_


**53**


After General O’Hara surrendered, the British troops were
directed to ground their arms. More than 7,000 British soldiers laid
down their guns. Of course, as James Thatcher recorded, many of
them were not happy about it:


_“Some of the platoon officers appeared to be exceedingly_
_chagrined when giving the word ‘ground arms,’ . . . many_
_of the soldiers manifested a sullen temper, throwing their_

~~**The Marquis de Lafayette**~~

The Marquis de Lafayette was one of the first Europeans to
volunteer to assist the colonists in their fight for independence. When
he offered to help the colonists fight the British, he was told that no
one could afford to pay him. Lafayette agreed to serve without pay.
The King of France did not want Lafayette, a nobleman, to go off to
war, but Lafayette was determined—even if it meant disobeying the
king! Lafayette went so far as to purchase a ship to carry him to North
America. Only 19 years old when he arrived, he quickly established
himself as one of Washington’s top generals in the Continental Army.

**Helping Hands**

There were also many heroes from other countries
who came to support the colonists and help them gain
independence from Britain. Kościuszko, from Poland,
helped the Continental Army win the Battle of Saratoga.
Von Steuben, the German, helped Washington transform
untrained farmers into a disciplined, well-regulated army. **Tadeusz Kościuszko**
The Marquis de Lafayette was the young Frenchman who was a major in
the Continental Army and helped Washington win the Battle of Yorktown.


Another hero was the Scottish sea captain John Paul Jones. Jones

to fight on the side of his adopted homeland. In 1779, his ship,
_Bonhomme Richard_, became involved in a sea battle with the
British ship _Serapis_ . The _Bonhomme Richard_ had 42 guns. The
_Serapis_ had 50 guns. For a while, the two ships floated right
next to each other, blasting away. At one point, a British sailor
**John Paul Jones** shouted to Jones, asking him if he was ready to surrender.


“Surrender?” Jones shouted back. “I have not yet begun to fight!”
In the end, it was the British captain who had to surrender. The story
of the victory—along with Jones’s **defiant** reply—was printed in
newspapers and John Paul Jones became a hero.



Nathan Hale, a schoolteacher from Connecticut,
demonstrated his heroism in a different way. In 1776, he
volunteered to help General Washington with a very
dangerous mission. He agreed to sneak behind British
lines in New York City and spy on the British army there.
Unfortunately, Hale was captured and the British gave
orders that he be hanged. However, before he died, according
to legend, Hale uttered, “I only regret that I have but one life to
lose for my country.”

**Nathan Hale**


**“Surrender?” Jones shouted back. “I have not yet begun to fight!”**



**59**


**Unsung Heroes**

Saul Matthews, an African **enlisted** in the Continental Army,
served as a soldier in Virginia. His name may be less recognizable
today than some of the others, but he became a hero in his own right.
Matthews was a successful spy and provided key information about
British troop positions. Colonel Josiah Parker commissioned Matthews
to go on spying missions in British military camps.


Another unsung colonial hero, James
Lafayette Armistead, was asked
to become a servant to Lord
Cornwallis to spy on him. At
some point, Lord Cornwallis
asked Armistead to become
a spy. Armistead agreed,
but what Cornwallis didn’t
know was that Armistead
was secretly working for
the colonial side. He passed
along important information
to the Continental Army and
gave unimportant information
to Lord Cornwallis.


fought in the Battles of Concord and
Lexington. He also fought in the Battle of Bunker Hill. Salem went on
to join the Fifth Massachusetts **Regiment** and served in the Continental
Army for seven years. Few soldiers served for that length of time. He
was considered to be a war hero. As a result, in 1882, a monument was
erected in Framingham, Massachusetts, in his honor.


**60**


There were also many **heroines** during this time in American
history. George Washington’s wife, Martha, played an important role
in helping the Continental Army survive at Valley
Forge. She helped make clothing for the
soldiers and helped take care of the sick.



Abigail Adams, the wife of John
Adams, raised their children and
managed their farm, but she also
housed and fed Continental soldiers.
Mrs. Adams was known to write
letters to her husband, one of the most
important delegates in the Continental
Congress. In these letters, Mrs. Adams

him know that she was opposed to slavery.



**Abigail Adams**



At the time, most people believed that fighting in the army was
strictly a job for men. Some women were allowed to serve in the army,
performing duties such as nursing, cooking, searching for food, and
even burying the dead. But women who tried to enlist were turned
away. Some women, however, disguised themselves as men so they, too,
could fight for their country.


Deborah Sampson, from Massachusetts, signed up for the army
using the name Robert Shurtlief. Sampson served for a year and a half
and fought in several **skirmishes** . In one of them, she was wounded.
Two musket balls lodged in her thigh. Sampson removed one of
the balls herself, but the other was buried too deep to be removed.
Fortunately, her wound healed and she survived. After the war,
Deborah Sampson was recognized by John Hancock for having shown
“an extraordinary instance of female heroism.”


**61**


Another woman, Mary Draper, also fed and clothed Continental
soldiers as they marched through her hometown. But she even went
so far as to melt down the pewter dishes she owned so that the metal
could be used to make bullets.


Still other women became heroes by simply standing up for what
they believed. Historians have recorded the story of Mum Bett, an
enslaved woman from Massachusetts. It seems Mum Bett may have
heard her patriot master reading the Massachusetts State Constitution
aloud. Bett thought about the words in that document, “All men are

opposed to slavery and
convinced him to take
her case. To the surprise
of many, she won the
lawsuit. In 1781, the
Supreme Court of
Massachusetts ruled
that Mum Bett could
no longer be held as
an enslaved person.
She celebrated her
victory by taking a new

**From Hero to Villain**

Benedict Arnold was a hero—
at first. Later, he became more
of a villain. He was one of the top
Continental Army generals at the
Battle of Saratoga and was praised after
the victory there. However, Arnold
opposed joining forces with the
French in 1778. He believed the
colonists had traded one enemy
for another.


In 1780, Benedict Arnold
made a plan to surrender the
colonial fort at West Point
in New York to the British.
When this plan was **foiled**,
Arnold joined the British
army. He went on to fight
for the British. The cheers
for Benedict Arnold the hero
quickly turned to **jeers** for
Benedict Arnold the **traitor.**

# ~~**The Legend of**~~ **Sleepy Hollow**
#### **(Adapted from the story** **by Washington Irving)**



**THE BIG QUESTION**
Why do people
believe a headless
horseman haunts
the village of
Sleepy Hollow?



Not far from the eastern shore of the Hudson River is a little valley
known as Sleepy Hollow. A drowsy, dreamy atmosphere hangs over the
valley, as if it were under the sway of some bewitching power. The
valley **abounds** with local tales, haunted spots, and twilight
superstitions. But the dominant spirit that haunts the region is the sight
of a ghostly figure on horseback without a head. It is said to be the spirit
of a Hessian soldier, whose head was carried away by a cannonball
during the Revolutionary War. The ghost is said to ride out nightly
to the scene of the battle in search of his head, and to return to the
churchyard before daybreak.


In this out-of-the-way place there lived a teacher by the name
of Ichabod Crane. His name was well-suited to him. He was tall and
very lanky, with narrow shoulders, long arms and legs, and hands
that dangled a mile out of his sleeves. He had huge ears, large green
eyes, and a long nose. To see him striding along on a windy day,
with his clothes fluttering about him, one might have mistaken him
for a scarecrow.


From his schoolhouse, his pupils could be heard reciting their
lessons. They were occasionally interrupted by the voice of the
master or by the sound of his **switch** .


**64**


According to custom, Ichabod Crane was boarded and lodged at
the houses of the farmers whose children he taught. He lived with each
family a week at a time. His arrival at a home caused great excitement,
for the ladies thought his taste and accomplishments superior to those
of the rough, country farmers. He had read many books. He was a
perfect master of Cotton Mather’s book on _History of the Supernatural_
_in New England_ . He himself was a firm believer in the supernatural.
Ichabod would sit in the schoolhouse after the students had departed,
reading old Mather’s book until dusk. Then, as he made his way back to
where he was staying, every sound of nature encouraged his overexcited
imagination.


**65**


He loved to pass long winter evenings with the farmers’ wives as
they sat spinning by the fire. He listened with interest to their tales of
ghosts and goblins—and of the headless horseman. But the cost of the
pleasure in all this was the terror of his walk home. What fearful shapes

but for her vast inheritance. Her father was a thriving farmer, and his
barn was filled with the fruits of his labor. Sleek porkers grunted in their
pens. Regiments of turkeys went gobbling through the farmyard. The
teacher’s mouth watered as he pictured every pig roasted with an apple in
its mouth and every turkey wearing a necklace of savory sausages. As he
cast his eyes upon the trees **laden** with fruit, and considered the obvious
wealth that surrounded him, he became determined to win the affections
of the farmer’s daughter.


However, he was not the only **suitor** . The most **formidable** of all
was a local hero known as Brom Bones. He was a **burly** young fellow,
famous for his horsemanship and always ready for a fight or some
fun. Whenever a crazy prank occurred in the neighborhood, people
whispered that Brom Bones must be at the bottom of it.


**66**


When Brom Bones began **wooing** Katrina, most other suitors gave
up the chase. But Ichabod Crane continued to hope he might convince
Katrina to marry him. He was therefore delighted when he received an
invitation to attend a party at Van Tassel’s home. When the day arrived,
he dismissed his pupils an hour early. He brushed his old black suit and
fussed over his appearance. He borrowed a horse so that he could arrive
gallantly mounted. The horse was gaunt and old. His mane was knotted
with burrs and he was blind in one eye. Ichabod was a suitable figure for
such a steed. His elbows stuck out like a grasshopper’s, and as he rode
his arms flapped like a pair of wings.


By the time he arrived, many people from the
surrounding countryside were already gathered in the
home of Van Tassel. Many beautiful young women
stood shoulder to shoulder. But what caught our
hero’s gaze as he entered the home was the sight
of a table piled high with food. There were sweet
cakes and short cakes, ginger cakes and honey
cakes. There were roasted chickens, slices of
glazed ham, and smoked beef. There were
apple and peach and pumpkin pies, and
delectable dishes of preserved plums.
As Ichabod sampled every dainty,
he chuckled to think that he
might one day be lord of all
this **splendor** .



**67**


lchabod danced proudly with Katrina, his loosely hung frame
clattering about the room, while Brom Bones sat brooding by himself in
the corner. When the party began to break up, lchabod stayed behind to
have a little talk with Katrina. He was fully convinced that he was now
on the high road to success. However, Ichabod’s talk did not go well, for
he soon sadly departed. He went straight to the stable and, with several
hearty kicks, galloped off into the night.


It was the bewitching time of night, and, as lchabod made his way
home, all the ghost stories that he had heard over the years now came
to mind. The night grew darker. The stars seemed to sink deeper in the
sky. Ichabod had never felt so lonely. A splash beside the bridge caught
his ear. In the darkness, he caught sight of something huge, misshapen,
black, and towering. The hair upon his head rose.


“Who’s there?” he stammered.


He received no reply.


The shadowy object put itself in motion and bounded into the
middle of the road. It appeared to be a large horseman, mounted on
a black horse. lchabod quickened his pace, in hopes of leaving the
mysterious horseman behind. The stranger quickened to an equal pace.
The reason for the silence of lchabod’s companion soon became clear.


**68**


For upon seeing his fellow traveler, gigantic in height, and muffled in
a cloak, Ichabod was horror-struck to notice that he was headless. The
figure carried his head before him on his saddle. In terror, lchabod
rained kicks upon his horse. The spirit followed close behind. Away the
two dashed, stones flying.


Ichabod cast a fearful look behind to see if he had escaped
the other horseman. Instead, he saw the horseman rising up in his
stirrups, preparing to hurl his head at Ichabod. Ichabod tried to dodge
the horrible missile, but he was too late. It hit his own head with a
tremendous crash. He tumbled into the dust, as the rider passed by like
a whirlwind.


**69**


**70**


The next morning Ichabod’s old horse was found grazing near the
home where Ichabod had been staying. The pupils assembled at the
schoolhouse, but no schoolmaster arrived. By the riverbank they found
the hat of poor Ichabod and, close beside it, a shattered pumpkin.


There was much gossip and speculation about the disappearance
of Ichabod Crane. Some said he had been carried off by the headless
horseman. Others said that he had simply left in humiliation because
he did not convince Katrina to be his wife. Shortly after Ichabod’s
disappearance, Brom Bones triumphantly married Katrina. Whenever
the story of Ichabod was told, Bones looked exceedingly knowing. The
old country wives, however, maintain to this day that Ichabod was
spirited away. It is said that one may still hear his voice humming a tune
among the solitude of Sleepy Hollow.

#### **by Washington Irving)**





In a village in the Catskill Mountains, there lived a simple, goodnatured fellow by the name of Rip Van Winkle. He was a kind neighbor,
and the children would shout with joy whenever he approached. Rip Van
Winkle was a lovable soul who was ready to attend to anybody’s business
but his own. As to keeping his own farm in order, he found it impossible,
and his children were as ragged as if they belonged to nobody.


Rip was one of those happy fools who lived without a care, ate
white bread or brown, whichever required less thought or trouble, and
preferred to starve on a penny than work for a pound. If left to himself,
he would have whistled his life away in perfect contentment, but his
wife was continually complaining about his laziness and the ruin he
was bringing upon his family. Rip would shrug his shoulders, shake his
head, cast up his eyes, but say nothing. This always **provoked** a fresh
attack from his wife, and so he frequently left the house to go outside.


Rip used to **console** himself, when driven from home, with the
company of a group of other men who met on a bench in front of
an inn. Sitting beneath a portrait of His Majesty King George III,
they talked over village gossip and told stories. If by chance an old
newspaper fell into their hands, they would listen as Van Bummel, the
schoolmaster, read aloud its contents. All kinds of discussions followed
the reading of the newspaper. Nicholas Vedder, a respected elder
member of the village, made his opinions known.


**72**


**Rip used to console himself, when driven from home, with the company of a group of**
**other men who met on a bench in front of an inn.**


**73**


One day, seeking to escape the hard work of the farm and the
complaints of his wife, Rip grabbed his gun and walked into the Catskill
Mountains to hunt for squirrels. All day the mountains echoed with the
sound of shots fired from his gun. Finally, he sat down on a little green
hill that looked down into the valley below. Rip admired the scene as
evening gradually advanced and sighed as he thought about the
journey home.


As he was about to descend, he heard a voice calling, “Rip Van
Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!” He caught sight of a strange figure climbing
up the rocks, carrying something on its back. Rip was surprised to see
any human being in this lonely place, but he concluded that it must be
one of his neighbors in need of assistance. Rip hurried down to help. The
stranger was a short old fellow with a grizzled beard. His clothes were
old-fashioned. He made signs for Rip to assist him, and together they
clambered up a narrow gully. Every now and then long rolling **peals** like
thunder seemed to issue out of a deep ravine. Passing through this ravine,
they came to a hollow.


In the center was a company of odd-looking persons playing at
**ninepins** . The thunderous noise Rip had heard from afar was the sound
of the ball rolling toward the pins. Like Rip’s guide, they were dressed
in an outlandish fashion, with enormous **breeches** . What seemed
particularly odd to Rip was that these folks looked very serious indeed.
They played without speaking and were, in fact, the most **melancholy**
party he had ever witnessed. They stared at Rip in such a way that his
heart turned within him and his knees banged together.


Rip and his guide joined the party. Before long, the events of the
day and the mountain air overpowered Rip, and he fell into a deep
sleep.


**74**


**the pins.**


**75**


Upon waking, Rip found himself on the green hill where he had
first seen the old man. It was a bright, sunny morning. “Surely,” thought
Rip, “I have not slept here all night.” He recalled the strange men. “Oh!
What excuse shall I make to Dame Van Winkle?” He looked around
for his gun, but found only an old, rusty firearm. Suspecting he had
been robbed, he decided to find the old-fashioned men and demand
his gun. As he rose to walk, he found himself stiff in the joints. With
some difficulty, he found the gully up which he and his companion
had ascended, but could find no traces of the ravine that had led to the
area with the odd little men playing ninepins. He shouldered the rusty
firearm and, with a heart full of trouble, turned his steps homeward.


As he approached the village, he met a number of people, but none
whom he knew. This surprised him, for he thought he was acquainted
with every one of his neighbors. Their dress, too, was of a different
fashion. They all stared at him with surprise and stroked their chins.
When Rip did the same, he found to his astonishment that his beard
had grown a foot long! A troop of children ran at his heels, hooting
after him and pointing at his gray beard. There were houses in the
village that he had never seen before, with unfamiliar names over the

doors. He began to wonder whether both he and the world around him
were bewitched.


With some difficulty he found his own house. The roof had fallen
in and the door was off its hinges. He entered and called for his wife
and children, but all was silent. He spotted a dog that looked like his
own and called out to him, but the dog snarled and showed his teeth.
“My own dog has forgotten me,” sighed poor Rip.


He hurried to the village inn. Before it now hung a flag with stars
and stripes. He spotted the face of King George on the sign, but now
his red coat was blue, his head wore a cocked hat, and underneath the
figure was printed GENERAL WASHINGTON. There was a crowd of
people around the door, but none that Rip knew. He inquired, “Where’s
Nicholas Vedder?”


**77**


There was silence. Then an old man replied, “Nicholas Vedder?
Why he is dead and gone these eighteen years!”


“Where’s Van Bummel, the schoolmaster?” asked Rip.


“He went off to the wars and is now in Congress,” the old man
answered.


Rip’s heart sank at hearing of these sad changes. “I’m not myself,”
he said sadly. “I was myself last night, but I fell asleep. Now everything
has changed, and I can’t tell who I am!”


**“I was myself last night, but I fell asleep. Now everything has changed, and I can’t tell**
**who I am!”**


**78**


The bystanders looked at each other in puzzlement. Then a young
woman pressed through the throng. She had a child in her arms, which,
frightened by the gray-bearded man’s looks, began to cry. “Hush, Rip,”
she murmured. “The old man won’t hurt you.”


The name of the child and the air of the mother awakened longago memories in Rip’s mind. He caught the mother in his arms and
said, “I am your father—young Rip Van Winkle once—old Rip Van
Winkle now! Does nobody know poor Rip Van Winkle?”


All stood amazed for a while. Then an old woman exclaimed, “Sure
enough! It is Rip Van Winkle! Welcome home again, old neighbor!
Why, where have you been these twenty years?”


Rip’s story was soon told, for the whole twenty years had been
to him but one night. Many were **skeptical**, but an old man who
was well-versed in the local traditions confirmed his story in the
most satisfactory manner. He assured the company that the Catskill
Mountains had always been haunted by strange beings, and that his
own father had once seen these odd little men playing ninepins in the
hollow of the mountain.


Rip’s daughter took him home to live with her. (Her mother had
died some years before.) Having arrived at that happy age when a man
can retire and rest, Rip took his place once more on the bench at the
inn and was **revered** as one of the wise, old men of the village. He used
to tell his story to every stranger that arrived. Some doubted the truth
of it, but the old villagers gave Rip full credit.


Even to this day, whenever a thunderstorm blows in, they say that
the odd little men are at their game of ninepins; and it is a common
wish of all **henpecked** husbands in the neighborhood, when life hangs
heavy on their hands, that they might take themselves up into the
Catskill Mountains in search of an adventure.

# ~~**Points of View**~~


Imagine you live in England in the 1770s. You read in the
newspaper about protests against taxes in Boston. You don’t understand
what all of the fuss is about. You pay your taxes. Why won’t the
colonists just settle down and pay theirs? Then you read about the
Boston Tea Party. From your point of view, the Sons of Liberty and
other patriots have behaved very badly. What gives them the right to
destroy tea that doesn’t belong to them? You feel like these **so-called**
patriots are really just criminals. They ought to be arrested and thrown


Boston Massacre was a friend
of yours. Imagine there are
soldiers with muskets all
over town, watching you.
How do the same events
look now? They probably
look very different. You
may see the Sons of Liberty
as heroes fighting against a

**oppressive** government.
**Bostonians reading the Stamp Act**


**80**


Let’s try the same exercise again. But this time let’s imagine how
things might look if your religious point of view changed. Imagine you
live in Virginia and are a member of the Church of England. You go to
church every Sunday and try to do what the pastor says is right. You are
a loyalist. You have been taught that it is important to remain loyal to
the king and the British government. So how can you possibly support
the rebellion in the colonies?


Now change your point of view again. Imagine that you live in
Massachusetts. You are a descendent of the Puritans who settled that
colony. You also go to a Christian church on Sundays, but you are not
a member of the Church of England. Your church is an independent
church that broke away from the Church of England many years
ago. Your church does not demand loyalty to the king. In fact, your
church was founded by men who stood up to kings. Members of your
family stood up to King Charles I in the 1640s. And their children
and grandchildren stood up to King James II in the 1680s. Does it
seem wrong to you to stand up to King George III? Not at all. On the
contrary, it seems like the right thing to do! You believe every citizen
has a right to stand up to a tyrannical king—and not just a right, a duty.


**Colonial protestors**


**81**


Now let’s imagine that your ancestors did not come to the colonies
from Europe. This was the case for many enslaved Africans. The
American Revolution was about taxes and self-government. It was
not about freeing the enslaved people or ending slavery. In fact, Thomas
Jefferson and many of the men who signed the Declaration of Independence
owned enslaved people. Still, many enslaved people agreed with their
words about “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”


Some African Americans saw things from the

poem for George Washington.
In it, she expressed her hope
that Washington and the
Continental Army would
eventually defeat the
British.


There were also
African American
soldiers. African American
militiamen fought with the **Phillis Wheatley**
colonists at Lexington and
Concord. There were also African
Americans at the Battles of Bunker Hill and Yorktown.


**82**


However, some African Americans fought for the British. In
November 1775, Lord Dunmore, the loyalist Governor of Virginia,
made a **proclamation** . He announced that any enslaved person who
ran away and joined the British army would be set free. Many did run
away and serve in the British army. Some of these soldiers wore a patch
on their uniform that read “Liberty to Slaves.”


Native Americans had their own point of view about the war. Or,
rather, they had many different points of view. It is **misleading** to think
of Native Americans as a single group. Each tribe had its own leaders,
its own history, and its own traditions.


Early in the war, colonists tried to convince many Native
Americans not to get involved. In fact, the Second Continental
Congress sent a message to six nations of native people specifically
asking them to avoid involvement in the conflict.


Some Native Americans **heeded** this advice and remained **neutral** .

moving west of the Appalachian Mountains.
They were to stay on the East Coast. If this law
were enforced, it could be a positive thing for
Native Americans. It could stop the westward
expansion of the colonists, which might
mean the native people would be able to
stay on their land. That is one reason Native
Americans, such as the Cherokee, fought for

**Cunne-Shote, Cherokee leader**

the British and against the colonists. **who sided with the British**


**83**


Some Native American
tribes sided with the
colonists. The Mohican,
who lived in western
Massachusetts, are one
example. The Mohican had
fought with the colonists
in the French and Indian
War, and they sided with
the colonists again in the
American Revolution.
Mohican Indians fought with
General Washington’s army
when he surrounded the
British army in Boston. They
also served in the army that
was victorious at Saratoga.


The events of the
American Revolution were
extraordinary. People from
different cultures, different
occupations, and different
opinions came together to
change the course of history.
A new nation was formed
and, in less than 200 years,
it would become the most
powerful nation in the world!

# ~~**Artillery Training**~~


“Gentlemen, welcome to the Third Continental Artillery
Regiment, under the command of Colonel Crane! I am Sergeant
Campbell. You are here to learn to fire a six-pound field cannon, like
the one you see before you.


“This cannon is not like the musket your father taught you to fire
back on the farm. It fires a six-pound cannonball and has a maximum
**range** of 2,000 yards, or a little more than a mile! But, if you want to fire
with accuracy, you will want to select a target that is no more than 1,000
yards away.


“This cannon has wheels on it, so it can be wheeled around on the
battlefield. That is why we call it a field cannon,” explained the sergeant.


“To fire this weapon you will need to work together, in teams of
seven. Each of you will have a job, and I will explain what you must do.
Are you ready to **master** the weapon?”


**85**


“Yes, sir,” the men replied.


“I can’t hear you!” yelled Sergeant Campbell.


“YES, SIR!” the men shouted as loudly as they could.


“That’s more like it,” continued Sergeant Campbell.


“Now, gentlemen, what you see before you is a muzzle-loading
cannon. That means that the cannonball is inserted at the **muzzle** end
of the cannon, rather than at the breech end. This is the muzzle end.
And this is the breech end,” said the sergeant, pointing first at the front
and then at the back of the cannon.


“At this point, you might think it would be perfectly fine to talk
about ‘the front of the cannon’ and ‘the back of the cannon.’ But you
would be mistaken. A skilled artillery man does not speak of ‘the front
of the cannon,’ or ‘the back of the cannon.’ He speaks of ‘the muzzle’
or ‘the breech.’ So, what is this end of the cannon called?” Sergeant
Campbell quizzed the men as he pointed to the front of the cannon.


“The muzzle!” said the men in unison.


“That is correct,” proclaimed Sergeant Campbell. “And this end?”
he bellowed, pointing at the other end.


“The breech!” yelled the men.


“Good. Now is this cannon a muzzle-loader or a breech-loader?”


“A muzzle-loader, sir!” yelled the men again.


“Correct! This is a muzzle-loader, which means the cannonball
is inserted at the muzzle end of the weapon,” continued Sergeant
Campbell. “However, there is something else that needs to be inserted


**86**


into the cannon first, before the cannonball. Do any of you know what
that is?” asked the sergeant.


Several hands shot up.


“Yes?” asked the sergeant.


“The powder?” said one of the soldiers.


“Correct!” Sergeant Campbell retorted. “Gentlemen, there is no
point in putting a cannonball in unless you have already put in a **charge**
of gunpowder. The powder is going to explode behind the cannonball,
and the force of the explosion is going to send the ball flying out of the
cannon. But the powder has to be behind the
cannonball. So it has to go in first.


Do any of you know what this is called?” he asked.


No one spoke.


“Repeat after me: the sponge!”


“The sponge!” the soldiers repeated.


devotion to the colonial cause. The sponge is attached to this pole. The
pole is about 10 feet long to allow you to reach down inside the cannon
and clean parts you could not **otherwise** reach.


**87**


“It is very important to clean out the cannon. Otherwise there
could be sparks in the pipe. Bits of paper or gunpowder might still
be burning from the last time you fired the gun. And believe me,
gentlemen, you do not want to stuff a new charge of gunpowder into
the cannon if there is still fire in the pipe. That will put a speedy end to
your war service! Do I make myself clear? So—always, always, always
dip the sponge in a pail of water and _then_ clean out the cannon.”


The soldiers nodded their heads enthusiastically.


“Next, use this thing here—the mop—to
dry out the inside of the cannon,” Sergeant
Campbell continued. “If it is too wet inside the

wet either.


drive the charge all the way down to the back of the cannon. See?


“Only then are you ready to insert the cannonball. Again, use the
ramrod to make sure it is pressed all the way down. Ram it down, like
this.


“Once the cannon is loaded, it must be aimed. This is a very
complicated business, which I will begin to explain tomorrow. For
now, let’s just say the higher you point the cannon, the farther the ball
will travel—at least until you get it tilted at a forty-five degree angle.
However, as I said, that is a topic for tomorrow.


**88**


“Now let’s move from the muzzle end to the breech end. Do you
see this small hole at the breech end of the gun?” he prompted, with a
serious expression on his face.


Once again the soldiers nodded.


“It is called the touch hole. Sometimes we also call it the vent. This
is where you will light the powder and fire the gun. First, however, you
need to puncture the charge.


“In order to fire the cannon, you must poke a hole in the charge
of powder that you stuffed into the cannon. See this little poker? Stick
it into the touch hole and poke a hole in the charge so that some of the
gunpowder is exposed.


gunpowder to waste any of it.


“The last step is to insert a quill fuse filled

filled with powder.


“Once the quill has been inserted, you must call out
‘PRIMED!’ That means the gun has been loaded and is ready to fire.


“Then wait for your commanding officer to call out, ‘GIVE FIRE!’
When he does, you will touch the quill with a long match. Then, stand
back! And, gentlemen, don’t stand here, behind the gun, because the
cannon will recoil, and if you’re standing at the breech end, it may well
knock you on your backside.


**89**


“Once you touch the match to the quill, BOOM! The cannonball
will go sailing out at the redcoats, teaching them new respect for the
