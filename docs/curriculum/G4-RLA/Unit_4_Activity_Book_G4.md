**If You Were a Boy Serf**


_Read the following excerpt from “To the Manor Born” aloud to a family member and_
_complete the activity that follows._


From an early age, you work a full day. You wake up just before sunrise and go to sleep

when it is dark. For breakfast, you have rye bread and water. Even before the sun is fully

risen, and regardless of the weather, you begin your work on the land. In springtime, you

are busy plowing and planting seeds. You assist in the delivery of baby lambs and calves. At

midday, you walk home for a simple meal of rye bread and maybe a small piece of cheese.

After lunch, you return to work, cutting logs for the lord’s fire.


In the summer months, you tend to the crops you planted in the spring. You keep the

hungry birds and insects away from the growing crops.


Autumn, the time to harvest crops, is perhaps the busiest time of all. You help your

mother and sisters pick fruits and berries, which they preserve and store for the winter.

Using a simple tool called a **scythe**, you harvest grain crops such as wheat, oats, rye, and

barley. You help store the grain. A good harvest makes everyone, especially the lord, very

happy. It means there is food to eat during the winter months. A good harvest is a time of

celebration for all.


Nevertheless, you have to get used to having less food to eat in the wintertime, and to

feeling hungry and cold more often than not. At times, your parents find it difficult to make

ends meet. Even if ice and snow lay upon the frozen earth, you still have jobs to do. You have

to feed and care for the livestock. You repair fences and barns. All the while, you continue

to work on your family’s strips of land. Each evening as the sun is setting, you return home

quite exhausted. You end your day with a meal called pottage that your mother or sisters

have prepared. Pottage is a vegetable stew with grain and a tiny piece of meat or fish in it.

After a good night’s sleep, you will wake up and do it all again!

It is raining again! You stand in a puddle on the edge of a narrow street. You have

just entered town through one of two gates. The gates are the only ways in and out of

this walled town. Inside the walls, tiny townhouses stand side-by-side. As you move

through the crowd, you spot rats scurrying about, feeding on discarded trash. Nearby,

you hear the varied cries of people selling fruits, vegetables, eggs, and pies. It is market

day and people have set up their stalls in the town square.


As you make your way through the muddy streets, you hear the sound of church

bells. They ring out to sound the hour and to call people to church.

**End-of-Unit Assessment—The Middle Ages**

**Reading Comprehension**

_Today you will read two selections related to the Middle Ages. After reading the first_
_selection, you will answer several questions based on it. Then, you will read the second_
_selection and answer several questions based on it. Some of the questions have two parts._
_You should answer Part A of the question before you answer Part B._

**Early Castles in England and France**


1 Castles in the Middle Ages served to protect and shelter kings and nobles. They were
also a base from which to launch an attack. Castles were initially wooden fort-like
structures. Over time, people replaced the wood with stone, and they added towers,
walls, and moats.


2 In France during the Middle Ages, a style of defensive structure developed that was
called the motte and bailey castle. The motte and bailey castle became a common
structure for defense.


3 A motte and bailey castle was a strong wooden structure built on top of a manmade
hill called a motte. Wooden steps or a ramp connected the courtyard, or bailey, to
the motte. People removed
these walkways during a siege
to prevent enemies from
entering. Royals and nobles
sometimes lived in the part of
the structure which sat on top
of the motte. The bailey housed
and provided protection for
the people who served the
king or the noble. The bailey
was also a safe place in which
to keep animals and food
supplies. A high wooden wall
encircled the entire structure,


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 4** **155**


4 To build the motte, men used soil they dug out of the earth to create the ditches. It
took hundreds of tons of soil, and many men, to construct the motte. But once that
was done, they could build the wooden structures in a matter of weeks. This work was
done without the aid of modern machines.


5 William the Conqueror brought this style of castle to England after his conquest in
1066. William the Conqueror had his soldiers build motte and bailey castles in the
most rebellious regions. In addition, he seized land from the Anglo Saxon nobles and
gave it to Norman nobles. The Norman nobles built motte and bailey castles on their
new land. Towns often sprang up around these castles.


6 Over time, as the weapons used to attack castles became more powerful, castles had
to become stronger, too. Eventually, people built castles with stone. This new style of
castle had thick stone walls and could better withstand fire and siege weaponry. A
moat often filled with water surrounded many of these stone castles. The only way
into a castle like this was across a wooden drawbridge that guards raised or lowered as
needed.


7 In the 1300s, people built even stronger castles with several outer walls. These walls
provided extra defense. Then, in the 1400s, people began to develop strong artillery
fire power. Even the strongest defensive features could not always withstand this
stronger firepower. As
a result, the function
and purpose of castles
changed. They became
impressive homes
rather than defensive
structures. Today, many
of these stone castles
still stand. They serve
as a reminder of what
life was like during this
period in history.

**Harry’s Life**


1 My name is Harry. I live in a small thatched cottage with my two younger sisters,
Mary and Margaret, and my parents. Lord Percy owns our home and the estate on
which our home sits. My family and I work for Lord Percy, planting and tending to his
crops, and taking care of his livestock. We own a pig, two cows, and several chickens.
Our cows graze on land nearby. Our pig lives in a small pen close to our cottage. My
sisters named our pig Chancellor in honor of the Lord Chancellor of England. The
Lord Chancellor is rich and very powerful. My father said that our pig looks a little
like the Lord Chancellor. However, my father spoke in a hushed tone when he uttered
those words.


2 When we are not working for Lord Percy, my sisters and I have our own chores to do.
We tend to our own crops, feed our livestock, and gather wood for the fire. My sisters
are often busy weaving, sewing, and baking, while I learn carpentry skills from my
father. Everyone looks after the garden that grows right outside our cottage. In the
garden we grow herbs such as fennel, dill, rosemary, cloves, and lemon thyme. My
mother uses the herbs for flavoring our food and for medicines. When I injured my
eye carving a longbow, she used fennel to ease the wound. When the plague struck,
my mother made clove tea, using cloves from our garden. We all survived and my
mother said it was because of her tea. Other families were not so fortunate.


3 During the spring, summer, and autumn months, we are usually busy working on the
land. We scatter the seeds, tend to the crops as they grow, and help to harvest them
when they are ready. There is little time to play, but whenever we can, we do. We have
lots of friends and we all like to race each other, play hide and seek, and climb trees.


4 My entire family lives and sleeps in one room. A fire fueled by wood warms our
house. My mother and sisters cook stews and soups on the fire. Whenever we can,
we eat meat such as rabbit and deer. My mother roasts the meat on a spit in front of
the fire. It is my job to turn the spit. The smell of the meat cooking makes my mouth
water. Our cows provide us with milk to drink. But we also churn the milk into cream
and we make cheese, too. Our chickens Ann, Eleanor, Mabel, and Gertrude provide
us with eggs.


Grade 4 Activity Book **| Unit 4** **159**


5 Holy days are very special. We go to church and we celebrate, or we fast. Our church
has beautiful stained-glass windows that show stories from the Bible. When the
sun shines through the colorful stained glass, the colors of the rainbow light up the
church. It is truly a wonderful sight.


6 My father says that seven generations of my family have worked for Lord Percy or
his ancestors. In each generation in our family, there has been a boy named Harry.
That’s why my father calls me Harry the Seventh. I expect I will live here all my life,
watching the seasons come and go. I am quite happy to do that. But sometimes I
dream about becoming a knight and riding off to seek my fortune.


**Questions**


_The following question has two parts. Answer Part A and then answer Part B._


9. **Part A** : In paragraph 5, Harry says the colors of the rainbow light up the church.
