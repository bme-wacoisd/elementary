**Writing a Description**

Excerpt 1 from _Letters from Heaven_ introduces the character Celeste. After reading, write
a paragraph describing this character’s mood, interests, and the way she acts toward
other people. Some of this information appears directly in the text, but you may have to
make inferences about other parts of Celeste’s personality. Focus on details from the text
and word choice that the author uses when writing about the character. Remember that
authors choose specific words and an attitude or feeling for each character they write,
giving each character a distinct voice.

**Dialogue and Action in Excerpt 3**

_Answer the following questions._


1. Who are the characters in the scene that makes up the frst part of Excerpt 3?

________________ and ________________


2. Underline the dialogue in the paragraphs below.

Mami gets home from the factory exhausted, like always. She opens the door, throws
her bag on the foor, takes of her shoes, and falls onto the couch.

“Mami, Mami! Close your eyes!” I say eagerly.

“ _Ay, cielo._ I’m so tired that if I close my eyes I’ll fall asleep right here.”

“No, Mami, close your eyes for a second,” I tell her, “and smell.”

I watch her close her eyes and her lips slowly curl up into a little smile.

“Something smells wonderful,” she says.

“Don’t open your eyes just yet,” I say, running to get the tray of _cangrejitos_ .

“Now,” I tell her.

When she sees them, the smile is erased from her face and she begins to cry. I start to
cry too. I place the tray on the table so that the _cangrejitos_ don’t get wet with tears and
I hug her. We stay like that for a while until we catch the scent of the _cangrejitos_ again
and we devour them in silence.


3. Now highlight the actions in the scene—something that is done, such as any
movement or activity, by the characters.

**Acting and Directing**

_In your group of three, one of you will be the director, and the other two will play Celeste and_
_her mother in the first scene of_ Excerpt _3 from Letters from Heaven._

_The director’s job is to make sure the scene accurately shows what the characters say, do and_
_how they feel. To do that, the director has to concentrate on the text, listen to the actors, and_
_give them feedback. The actors have to make the audience believe they are the mother and_
_Celeste and accurately convey their feelings._

_Read and think about the following questions to prepare for your role._


1. As Celeste, think about:

  - How would your character show that she is eager to talk to Mami?

  - Why does your character begin to cry when Mami cries?

  - Why does your character want her mother to close her eyes before your character
brings out the tray of _cangrejitos_ ?


2. As Mami, think about:

  - How is your character feeling when she arrives home? Why?

   - Why does your character curve her lips into a smile?

   - How does your character’s feelings change as the scene continues?


3. As the director, think about:

   - Are the characters standing or sitting? Where are they looking?

  - How do they emphasize their words?

  - How does what one character says impact the other character?


4. When listening as an audience, think about:

  - How did the actors show the emotions of the characters?

  - Did what they say and do match the text?

   - Look at the actors’ facial expressions. How do they change throughout the scene?
