# **Welcome!**
#### **Grade 4, Unit 10**
## **Novel Study: Number the Stars**

Dear Family Member,


Welcome to Grade 4, Unit 10 Novel Study: _Number the Stars_ . In this unit, students will read the
novel _Number the Stars_ by Lois Lowry and will focus on analyzing character development and
making text-to-life connections. Here is what your student will be learning about and
accomplishing over the next few weeks.

### **What’s the story?**

Students will learn about **bravery** and **friendship** as they read _Number the Stars._ This novel
study will help students grow in their reading abilities and their enjoyment of **authentic**
**texts** and will encourage them to appreciate other people's **perspectives** and **experiences** .

### **What will my student learn?**

Students will learn about the **author's craft and purpose** as they analyze the relationships
among the characters in the story. They will be challenged to **evaluate** their definitions of
**heroism** and **bravery**, **reflect** on their relationships, and **integrate** the different kinds of
learning they do throughout the school day. They will gain an understanding of the conflict
between the two alliances during World War II and the threat inherent to a totalitarian
government.


Daily **reading** and **writing activities** to practice **literary analysis** will support students'
