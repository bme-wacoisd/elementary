# **Welcome!**
#### **Grade 4, Unit 3**
## **Contemporary Fiction**

Dear Family Member,


This unit is centered around excerpts from the novel _Letters_ _from_ _Heaven_ by Lydia Gil.
The chapters students will study are appropriate for Grade 4 and have been included
in this unit.
### **What’s the story?**

Lydia Gil’s novel _Letters_ _from_ _Heaven/Cartas_ _del_ _Cielo_ centers on the main character's,
Celeste’s, journey of preserving traditions, memories and relationships after losing her
grandmother. Celeste mysteriously receives letters from her deceased grandmother,
containing recipes for some of the family’s favorite Cuban dishes. As she cooks her way
through these dishes, Celeste processes the loss of her grandmother and discovers ways to
carry on family traditions and keep her grandmother close to her heart. Students will read
excerpts from this novel that have been chosen to appropriately support their
understanding of contemporary fiction in Grade 4. The unit includes guidance for teachers
to aid students in understanding the theme of loss throughout the novel. The lessons build
on each other throughout the unit to help students explore the **characters** and **themes** in
the text with **multiple** **readings**, **uncovering** **the** **rich** **English** **and** **Spanish** **language** and
**vocabulary** used throughout the story.

### **What will my student learn?**

Students will learn to be slow, **careful** **readers** who can peel back many **layers**
**of** **meaning** in a text. They will dig deeper and discover new meaning as they **read**
**excerpts** from the novel.


Students will move flexibly between **reading** and **writing** . They will engage in lessons that
teach them to take what they have learned in their reading and **apply** **that** **understanding**
**to** **their** **writing** .

### **Conversation starters**

Ask your student questions about the unit to promote discussion and continued learning:


1. At this point in your reading, what do you know about the main character?

2. Where do you think the letters are coming from? Why do you think the author chose
to keep it a mystery from Celeste and from the reader?

3. You have been learning about themes in your reading. What is a theme? What is a
theme that you have explored in _Letters_ _from_ _Heaven_ ?


4. You have been discussing relationships between characters in this unit. What are
some of the relationships that affect Celeste's feelings and behavior in the story?
**Follow** **up:** Why do you think relationships have such an impact on Celeste? What
are some relationships that are important to you?

5. What are some of the types of figurative language you have learned about?

**Follow** **up:** Can you give me some examples of those types of figurative language
you have seen in your reading?
