Unit 2 Episode 1 1


Find Your Lab Clues: Airplane


**Orville and Wilbur Wright practiced flying and steering gliders**
**for two years before building the** _**Flyer**_ **.**


**They succeeded in keeping the** _**Flyer**_ **airborne at Kitty Hawk,**
**North Carolina, in 1903 because they had installed innovative**
**controls to keep it balanced and stable.**


**They continued experimenting for two more years, eventually**
**building the** _**Flyer III**_ **which had separate levers for turning it left**
**or right, lifting its nose or tail, and tilting it from side to side.**


**These additions, known as three-axis controls, were the secret**
**to their success. Three-axis controls are still used today.**


Unit 2 Episode 1 2


Find Your Lab Clues: Microscope


**In the 1650s a young Dutchman named Antonie van Leeuwenhoek**
**began experimenting with glass lenses.**


**He manufactured a tiny lens that he**
**then attached to a brass plate.**


**By 1676 he had improved his invention to the point where he was**
**even able to see single-celled organisms, like protozoa.**


**Thanks to van Leeuwenhoek’s invention, nineteenth-century**
**scientists like Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur were able**
**to identify the bacteria that cause deadly diseases like**
**cholera and tuberculosis.**


Unit 2 Episode 1 3


Find Your Lab Clues: Paper


**In ancient China, people wrote on silk, which was very**
**expensive, or on scrolls of bamboo, which were very heavy**
**and difficult to manufacture.**


**Around the year 105 AD, a record-keeper named Cai Lun decided**
**he would come up with a better option—a writing surface that**
**was light, cheap, and easy to make.**


**He succeeded, and his invention made his job of writing down,**
**transporting, and storing records much easier.**


**His invention also enabled people to spread knowledge over**
**great distances by carrying lightweight documents with**
**them wherever they traveled.**


Unit 2 Episode 1 4


Find Your Lab Clues: Clock


**As people started interacting with one another in more**
**complicated ways, time became important.**


**They divided the day into twenty-four hours and needed**
**to keep track of those hours accurately.**


**People began measuring small units of time with sundials,**
**determining the passage of daylight hours by observing the**
**direction and size of shadows cast by the sun.**


**The next great innovation in timekeeping was a simple bowl with**
**holes carved in it: if you knew how long it took for all the water to**
**flow out of a full bowl, you could measure the passage of time by**
**checking the water level.**


**As the centuries marched on, these inventions became more**
**accurate as water power was replaced by springs and pendulums.**


Unit 2 Episode 1 5


Find Your Lab Clues: Radio


**In 1894 a young man in Italy, Guglielmo Marconi, read a book**
**that explained how to produce electromagnetic waves—electricity**
**that travels through the air.**


**He quickly got to work in his attic building a wireless transmitter**
**(to send messages) and a wireless receiver (to receive messages).**


**Soon scientists and businesspeople realized that the**
**future of Marconi’s technology was in sending sound directly**
**to receivers in people’s homes.**


**The first commercial stations began broadcasting in**
**1920, and by 1930 programs were being heard in twelve**
**million American homes.**


**Stations broadcast news, music, comedies, adventure shows,**
**game shows, soap operas, talent contests—almost everything**
**you see on TV today.**


Unit 2 Episode 1 6


Find Your Lab Clues: Telephone


**Alexander Graham Bell aimed to send the human voice**
**across a wire by turning it into electrical signals.**


**Bell worked on improving the invention, and in 1876 he and his**
**assistant had a conversation over a distance of two miles. The**
**first words spoken were “Mr. Watson, come here. I want to see**
**you.”**


**Businesses saved money, as meetings that had once required**
**long-distance travel could now be held using his invention.**


**People living in isolated areas were now able to call**
**for help in an emergency.**
