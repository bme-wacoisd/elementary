# **Welcome!**
#### **Grade 4, Unit 2**
## **Eureka! The Art of Invention**

Dear Family Member,


This unit offers a unique learning experience for students as they read a range of
informational texts about inventors, inventions, and the process of creation.

### **What’s the story?**

Students will have the chance to ultimately become inventors themselves while they
**analyze the world** around them, **identify problems**, and **create solutions** for those
problems.

### **What will my student learn?**

Students will become contestants of an exciting reality TV game show. As part of the show,
they will **practice observation**, **communication**, and **persuasion** in fun and interactive
ways.

Students will engage in **collaborative discussions** and will **share ideas** with their
classmates. They will work in teams to **participate in activities** and **challenges** that will be
guided by both the teacher and inventor-judges, such as Thomas Edison and George
Washington Carver.
