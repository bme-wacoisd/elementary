Introduction


~~**TREASURE ISLAND: X MARKS THE SPOT**~~


This introduction includes the necessary background information to teach the Treasure Island
unit. This unit contains 19 daily lessons as well as three Pausing Point days that may be used for
differentiated instruction. Each entire lesson will require a total of 90 minutes. Lesson 15 is devoted
to a unit assessment. It is recommended that you spend no more than 22 days total on this unit.


~~**WHY THE TREASURE ISLAND UNIT IS IMPORTANT**~~


This unit examines the fiction genre through a classic novel, _Treasure Island_ . Students will focus
on character development, setting, and plot, as well as literary devices, while reading an abridged
version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s popular adventure story. It is important for students in
the upper elementary grades to read longer works of fiction and trace the development of plot,
characters, and literary elements over the course of a novel; this unit will provide students that
opportunity. In addition, this text presents an opportunity for students to learn about the adventure
story as a unique subgenre of fiction. Students will also be exposed to other relevant aspects of
the text, such as geography, pirates, and sailing. For more information about the quantitative and
qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text
Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


The texts that students will be reading and discussing in this unit also provide opportunities for
students to build content knowledge and draw connections to the social studies subject area. At
times throughout the unit, you may wish to build on class discussions to support students in making
cross-curricular connections to the strand of Social Studies Skills from the Social Studies TEKS.
This content is not a replacement for grade-level social studies instruction.


Introduction
**1**


**Prior Knowledge**


Students who have received instruction in the program in Grades K–3 and up to this point in Grade
4 will already have pertinent background knowledge for this unit. These students may have gained
relevant background knowledge during the following units:


Kings and Queens (Grade K)


Fairy Tales and Folktales (Grade K)


Sharing Stories (Grade 1)


The War of 1812 (Grade 2)


Early Explorations of North America (Grade 3)


Colonial America (Grade 3)


Classic Tales: The Wind in the Willows (Grade 3)


American Revolution: Building a Nation (Grade 4)


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**2**


~~**READER**~~


The Reader for this unit, _Treasure Island_, includes complex text and prepares students in Grade 4
for the increased vocabulary and syntax demands aligned texts will present in later grades. This
is an abridged version of the original novel written by Robert Louis Stevenson and published in
1883. _Treasure Island_ chronicles the adventures of the young narrator, Jim Hawkins, who discovers
a treasure map when an old pirate stays at his family’s inn. After joining forces with a doctor and
a squire, Jim travels in search of treasure on a distant island. The novel vividly portrays a host of
challenges, including encounters with dangerous pirates and a mutiny on the ship. Jim uses his wits
to outsmart the pirates in this tale of greed, adventure, duplicity, and bravery.


The Reader also includes two selections that may be used for enrichment. Although the Teacher
Guide does not include lessons for these enrichment selections, the Activity Book includes activity
pages students may complete independently. Please use these selections at your discretion,
considering students’ needs and the time available in your school day. You may wish to have
students read “The Voyage” after they have read Chapters 3 and/or 4 in the Reader, as the selection
includes text from the original _Treasure Island_ that corresponds to the events covered in these
chapters. You may also wish to have students read “Blackbeard” after they have read Chapter 2 in
the Reader, as the selection is about the infamous pirate, who is referenced in that chapter.


Also remind students that the original language of the text has not been adjusted. This means
historic language has been preserved in the text for the purpose of this unit. Remind students that
some words that we use today may have had different meanings back then.


Introduction
**3**


~~**WRITING**~~ ~~**TEKS 4.2.C**~~


In the writing lessons, students will engage in an extended writing project, while continuing to
practice the various stages of the writing process. They will begin by drafting a character sketch and
then will write, publish, and share an original adventure story. While working on the adventure story,
students will focus on character development, dialogue, verb choice, and revision methods.


In Grade 4, students will write legibly in cursive to complete assignments. Writing legibly includes
knowledge of how to connect letters, using appropriate spacing and letter height. In order to master
these skills, encourage students to complete activities in cursive throughout the unit.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available in the program’s online materials. This
component was created to accompany materials for Grades 4 and 5. It consists of selections from
a variety of genres, including poetry, folklore, fables, and other selections. These selections provide
additional opportunities for students to practice reading with fluency and expression (prosody). For
more information on implementation, please consult the supplement.


~~**TEACHER RESOURCES**~~


At the back of this Teacher Guide, you will find a section titled “Teacher Resources.” In this section,
you will find the following:

**Primary Focus:** Students will identify relevant geographical points, historical events,

and key ship terms to prepare for reading the adventure story _Treasure Island_ .

~~**TEKS 4.1.A; TEKS 4.8.D**~~


~~**REVIEW GEOGRAPHY AND HISTORY (10 MIN.)**~~


                  - Tell students they will begin a literary unit called _Treasure Island: X Marks the_

_Spot_ ; the Reader for this unit is called _Treasure Island_ . Explain that before
reading the first chapter of the Reader, you will discuss some things they may
already know, as well as some important new information, that will help them
understand what they will learn in this unit.

                  - Explain that _Treasure Island_ is a literary text in the subgenre of adventure

stories. It is a specific type of adventure story—a romance. This kind of
romance is not about love, but about the brave feats, or acts, of heroes, such
as knights or explorers, who strive for noble goals. Romance also refers to
a kind of writing that focuses on mysterious characters, faraway places,
exaggerated heroes, and adventure.

                  - Tell students that _Treasure Island_ was written by Robert Louis Stevenson. Robert
Louis Stevenson was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. Refer to the world map you
prepared in advance and point out the location of Scotland on the map.

                 - Explain that Robert Louis Stevenson was sick for much of his life. He traveled

frequently as an adult, looking for a place with a climate that was good for
his health. At different times in his life, he lived in England, Scotland, and
the Samoan Islands in the South Pacific. He also visited France, Germany,
Switzerland, and the United States. Stevenson’s traveling experience is
reflected in the imaginative settings of _Treasure Island_ .

                 - Explain that the beginning of _Treasure Island_ is set near Bristol, England. Point
out the location of England on the map.

                  - Tell students that _Treasure Island_ also mentions the Spanish Main, which were
the Spanish-claimed lands along the northern coast of South America and
in the Caribbean. Locate this area of South America and the Caribbean on
the map.

                 - Ask students how the settings of _Treasure Island_ might influence the plot of the
story. (Answers may vary.)


**TEKS 4.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and make pertinent comments; **TEKS 4.8.D** Explain
the influence of the setting, including historical and cultural settings, on the plot.


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**10**


 - Tell students that _Treasure Island_ was published in 1883. Although the novel
was written in 1883, the action of _Treasure Island_ takes place in the 1700s.
In other words, Stevenson imagined the story happening over a hundred
years earlier.


 - Refer to the Core Connections Timeline you prepared in advance. Record two
new items on the Core Connections Timeline: 1883: Robert Louis Stevenson
publishes _Treasure Island_ ; 1700s: setting of _Treasure Island_ .


 - Explain that in the 1700s, England was one of the most powerful countries in
the world.


 - Based on the information on the Core Connections Timeline, have students
tell what other events they have learned about that occurred during the 1700s.
(the French and Indian War; the American Revolution)


 - Tell students that during the late 1400s and throughout the 1500s and 1600s,
rulers of European countries sent explorers to new lands, or the New World,
to claim land and riches for their homelands. People were also sent to various
parts of the world to conduct trade. Students may remember this from
learning about kings and queens, Christopher Columbus and other explorers,
and colonial America.


 - Point out the following related historical events on the Core Connections
Timeline: the Age of Exploration, in which European countries engaged in
exploration, colonization, and trade; Christopher Columbus’s arrival in the
New World; the settling of Jamestown; the Pilgrims’ landing at Plymouth.


 - Have students ask questions that they have so far. You may wish to record the
questions on chart paper to return to as the unit progresses.


~~**INTRODUCE PIRATES AND PIRACY (25 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain that _Treasure Island_ features pirates. Pirates are people, usually
criminals, who attack and rob ships at sea.


 - Explain that piracy became especially problematic in the 1500s, 1600s, and
1700s. Remind students that the 1700s is the period during which _Treasure_
_Island_ takes place.


 - Tell students that during that time, there were many ships at sea because of a
rise in trade and exploration.


Lesson 1 The Old Seadog
**11**


Check for Understanding


Ask students why they think piracy was a frequent occurrence during a
time of trade and exploration. Prompt students to consider what types of
goods and riches could be found on such ships and consider why pirates
would be interested in the contents of these ships.


» Pirates would attack merchant ships in search of gold, goods,

and supplies.


                 - Explain that pirates would attack ships as they sailed in the Atlantic Ocean.
Areas where piracy was common included the East Coast of the American
colonies and states, and the Caribbean. As needed, point out these areas on
the map.


                - Tell students piracy was a significant problem because European goods
were stolen and sailors were killed. Pirates, like Blackbeard, were fierce,
dangerous criminals who threatened the wealth and lives of people all over
Europe, particularly British sailors. Piracy became so prevalent that the British
Parliament passed laws to try to resolve the problem.


                 - Explain that as European navies grew in size and power in the 1700s and
1800s, Europeans were able to gain the upper hand, and piracy declined
dramatically after the 1830s. Record one new item on the Core Connections
Timeline: “1830s: Piracy largely disappears.”


                  - Explain that literature often reflects trends in history and culture. _Treasure_

_Island_ was written after piracy had largely declined, but it takes place during
the “Golden Age of Piracy” (1650–1720) and reflects a fascination with a
disappearing part of history. Record one new item on the Core Connections
Timeline: “1650–1720: Golden Age of Piracy.”


                - Tell students that there have been many different books and movies

portraying pirates during the Golden Age of Piracy. Ask students to share
any books or movies they have seen that portray pirates. Students may be
familiar, for example, with the _Pirates of the Caribbean_ films. Ask students to
describe pirates based on what they may have already read in books or seen
in films. (Answers may vary.)


                 - Point out that modern-day pirates still exist and are active in some parts of the

world today, for example attacking large ships off the coast of Africa.


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**12**


- Explain that books and movies often give very vivid depictions of pirates, but
there are not enough eyewitness accounts of interactions with pirates for us
to be absolutely sure what they really looked like.


- Ask students to turn and talk with a peer and name some of the stereotypical
features of pirates.


◦Some pirates may have worn eye patches, for example, to keep one eye
prepared for darkness at all times, so if they needed to duck below deck,
they could switch the patch to the other eye and see in the dark instantly.


◦Pirates are often described in books and movies as having exotic, or very
unusual, pets, such as monkeys or parrots. Explain that we don’t know for
sure whether pirates actually kept these animals, but if they did, it is unlikely
that they were pets. Instead, they were exotic souvenirs or loot from their
travels to be sold upon return home.







Images of pirates often include a hook or peg leg. Piracy was a dangerous
job. Injuries were frequent and could have included the loss of a limb. In
those cases a hook or peg leg might have been used to replace the lost hand
or leg and could have helped a wounded pirate.




 - Have students turn to Activity Page 1.1. Working in small groups, have students
draw what they think a pirate may have looked like during the 1700s based on
the information you have given them.


 - Once students have had time to draw, bring the whole group back together
to discuss the drawings. Have students explain why they included certain
characteristics and relate their drawings back to the information they’ve
learned about pirates.


 - Have students ask any additional questions that they may have. Add them to
the questions chart if one was created.


~~**INTRODUCE NAUTICAL TERMS (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that _Treasure Island_ focuses on a sailing adventure. Many of the

book’s characters have experience and knowledge dealing with ships. There
are various nautical terms and references to areas of ships throughout the
story. To help them prepare for reading the book, tell students you will define
and explain some key terms.


 - Explain that pirates traveled by ship. Ships were obtained in various ways,

including through theft. A common type of vessel, or ship, used by pirates of
the 1700s was the _schooner._

- Refer to the displayed Core Connections Schooner Diagram and explain that
this diagram shows the type of 1700s-era schooner that was commonly sailed
by merchants and pirates of the time on the high seas, or ocean.


- Tell students that you will explain some of the important aspects of the ship.


- First tell students that specific directional terms describe the different areas
of a ship. Explain the following directional terms and point out the related
areas on the Core Connections Schooner Diagram:


◦Fore: toward the bow, or front, of the ship











Aft: toward the stern, or back, of the ship


Starboard: toward the right-hand side of the ship (when one is facing the
front of the ship)


Port: toward the left-hand side of the ship (when one is facing the front of
the ship)




- Next, tell students that there are different levels of a ship.


- Tell students that the top level of a ship includes the _masts_ and _sails._ Explain
that masts are tall poles that hold the sails. Point out the two masts on the
diagram. Explain that sails are pieces of fabric used to catch wind as a way to
move a ship through the water. Point out the sails on the diagram.


- Tell students that the main level includes the main deck. This is the open-air

area of a ship that is the surface, or floor, of the ship. This open-air area might
have different levels. It’s where the people on the ship usually work. Point out
the main deck on the diagram.

 - Read the title of the Reader with students and explain that this Reader
is a literary adventure story. Students will learn more about what makes
something an adventure story later in this unit.


 - Remind students _Treasure Island_ is a work of fiction by Robert Louis
Stevenson. The word _fiction_ describes a story about events that are not real
but that instead come from the author’s imagination.


 - Tell students that the story was first published as a book in 1883. The author
decided to write the story after creating a map of an imaginary island with his
12-year-old stepson.


 - Explain that the version of the story students will read is _abridged_, meaning it
has been shortened and edited without alterations to the theme, style, or plot
of the original novel.


 - Have students turn to the table of contents. Either read several chapter titles
from the table of contents aloud or have students read them. Ask students to
describe the information they gather by reading the chapter titles in this table
of contents.


 - Give students a few moments to flip through the Reader and comment on the
images they see.


 - Ask students to share any questions or comments they have about the
Reader. Encourage them to think about their questions as they read.


~~**INTRODUCE THE CHAPTER (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students you will read aloud Chapter 1, “The Old Seadog and the Black
Spot.” They should follow along in their Reader as you read.

worked through that,’ he said, looking fierce”.).

are all I need. You can call me Captain.” Then, as if by magic, he threw
down four gold pieces. “Tell me when I’ve worked through that,” he
said, looking fierce.


During the daytime, in sunshine or in driving rain, the old captain
hung ’round the cove, keeping watch with a brass **spyglass** . In the
evenings, he sat beside a roaring fire. We soon learned to let him be,
lost as he was in his own private thoughts.


Every day he would ask if any **seafaring** men had gone by on the
road. At first we thought he wanted company of his own kind, but we
eventually realized he wanted to avoid them. It wasn’t long before I
understood the reason for this odd behavior. He took me aside one day
and promised me a penny on the first of every month if I would keep my
eyes peeled for a seafaring man with one leg.


“Let me know the moment he appears!” he growled.


How the man with one leg haunted my dreams! On nights when
the wind shook the house and the surf roared in the cove, I would see
him in a thousand forms. Sometimes his leg would be cut off at the
knee. Sometimes it would be cut off at the thigh. In my nightmares, the
man with one leg chased me, calling out my name and hopping along
on his good leg. He was always just a matter of inches behind me. I paid
pretty dear for my monthly penny in the shape of those terrible dreams.


Often, in the evenings, the old captain would sing a wild sea
song and force the inn guests to sing the chorus. On these occasions,
it seemed as if the house was quaking as the words echoed within its
walls. The old seaman’s stories about bloodthirsty pirates, ferocious
storms at sea, and wild deeds on the Spanish Main terrified our guests.
He must have lived among some of the most wicked men ever to sail
the seas.


**3**


**Inferential.** Make an inference about why the captain says, “This is the perfect
place for me” and justify your inference with evidence from the text.


» Answers may vary, but should include evidence from the text. The captain

might think the inn is perfect because he is looking for a quiet place to stay. It is

possible he doesn’t want to be bothered by other people or he might be hiding

from someone. One could draw these inferences because the captain declares

the inn the perfect place for him after the narrator replies they don’t have much

company there.

Remind students that the
setting is where and when
the story takes place.


Support


Explain that the captain
gives the narrator money
as payment up front in
exchange for food and
lodging at the inn. When
the captain says, “Tell me
when I’ve worked through
that,” he is saying that he
wants the narrator to tell
him once he has spent all
of his money.

- Read the rest of page 3 aloud.


**Literal.** What details can you gather about the narrator so far?


» Answers may vary, but should include that the story is told in first person by

someone whose family ran the Admiral Benbow Inn; the story is being told by this

person at the request of Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, and other gentlemen, who

have not been introduced yet; the narrator is interacting with a captain who has

come to stay at the inn.


**Literal.** What details can you gather about the setting so far?


» Answers may vary, but should include that the story is set sometime in the past;

the story begins at the Admiral Benbow Inn.


**Evaluative.** What questions do you have about the narrator or the setting so far?


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot


He stayed for several months and never offered us any further
payment. Whenever my father mentioned his bill, the captain would
raise his voice and stare ominously at him until he retreated. I am sure
the terror in which my father lived greatly hastened his death.


One morning, while the captain was out walking and taking in the
salty sea air, another seafaring man arrived. I was setting the breakfast
table when the door opened and the man stepped in. He was a pale,
rascally looking creature, and I noticed he was missing two fingers.


“Is this here table for my mate Bill?” he asked, pointing to a
table that had indeed been set for our secretive guest. It was not a
straightforward question, and he uttered those words with more than
a hint of sarcasm.


I told him the table was for a man who called himself the captain.


“Has he got a nasty scar on one cheek?” he inquired.


“Yes,” I replied.


“Well, that would be my mate Bill. Is he here?” he continued.


“He’s out taking a stroll,” I explained.


The stranger announced that he would wait for his mate to return.
Then he stood inside the door, peering out like a hungry cat waiting for
a mouse. After a while, the captain strode in.


“Bill!” shouted the stranger.


The captain spun around. He had the look of a man who had seen
a ghost.


“Black Dog!” he gasped.

- Read pages 4 and 5 aloud.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to provide a meaning for the word _ominously_ based on how it
is used in the text. If students cannot reach the correct definition, explain
that _ominously_ is an adverb meaning “giving a sign something bad will
happen.” Then explain that this could be determined using evidence from
the text, such as “the captain would raise his voice and stare,” “until he
retreated,” “the terror in which my father lived greatly hastened his death.”



Challenge


Ask students to identify
the simile on page 4 (“like
a hungry cat waiting for a
mouse”) then explain what
this simile suggests about
how the stranger feels
about the captain.



Lesson 1 The Old Seadog
**21**


Support


The seafaring man comes
looking for a man named
Bill with a nasty scar on
one cheek. The seafaring
man also calls the man
Billy Bones. The narrator
notes that the man who
came to stay at the inn
has a sabre cut on his
cheek and asked to be
called Captain.



“And who else?” returned the other. “Black Dog’s come to see his
old shipmate Billy Bones.”


“Now look here,” hissed the captain. “You’ve managed to run me
down. What’s your business?”


“I’ll have a drink,” said Black Dog. “Then we’ll sit down and talk
square, like old mates.”


They sat down, and for a long time I could hear nothing but low
mumbling. Gradually their voices grew louder until the interaction
became a cacophony of unpleasant exchanges. This was followed by an
explosion of crashing sounds—the chair and table went over, a clash
of steel followed, and then a cry of pain. The next instant I saw Black
Dog in full flight, and the captain in hot pursuit, both men with sabres
drawn. Blood streamed from Black Dog’s left shoulder. At the door, the
captain aimed one last tremendous blow, which would certainly have
struck Black Dog had it not been intercepted by the inn’s signboard.


Black Dog, in spite of his wound, disappeared over the hill in half
a minute. The captain stood staring like a bewildered man. At last he
turned, staggered, gasped for breath, and grabbed the door with one
hand.


“Jim!” he croaked. “Water!”


I ran to fetch him water, but as I fumbled with the jug, I heard
a loud crash. Running back, I saw the captain lying on the floor.
Immediately I heard my mother’s footsteps on the stairs. Moments later
she was standing beside me. Together, we gently raised the captain’s head.
It was clear that he needed a doctor, so we sent for Dr. Livesey. Then, as
carefully as we could, we moved the captain into the parlor.

**Inferential.** Who is Billy Bones?


» the captain



Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**22**


Check for Understanding


Ask students to provide a meaning for the word _cacophony_ based on
how it is used in the text. If students cannot reach the correct definition,
explain that _cacophony_ is a noun meaning “a mixture of harsh, unpleasant
sounds.” This could be determined from evidence in the text, such as
“gradually their voices grew louder,” “unpleasant exchanges,” and the fact
that the two men begin to fight.


**Evaluative.** What kind of relationship do you think the captain and Black Dog have?
How do you know?


» Answers may vary, but may include that they do not have a good relationship,

even though they are old shipmates. The captain looks like he has seen a ghost

when he hears Black Dog call out his name, likely because the captain is not

expecting to hear Black Dog’s voice. Black Dog may have been the one the captain

was on the lookout for and trying to avoid during his stay at the inn. The captain

hisses at Black Dog when asking why he has come to find him (“run [him] down”).

The fact that the two men sit down and talk for a long time, with their voices

gradually getting louder, and then eventually fight with each other, indicates they

do not have a good relationship.


**Inferential.** Who is narrating the story and how do you know?


» Jim is narrating the story. We know because the captain says, “‘Jim! Water!’” and

then the narrator says, “I ran to fetch him water.”


Lesson 1 The Old Seadog
**23**


Shortly after Dr. Livesey arrived, the captain opened his eyes and
looked about.


“Where’s Black Dog?” he mumbled.


“There’s no Black Dog here,” the doctor said. “You’ve had a **stroke** .
Now lie back and rest.”


Dr. Livesey drew some blood, and the old sailor fell asleep.


“He needs to rest for at least a week,” said the doctor emphatically.
“Another stroke will surely kill him.”


Later, when the captain woke up, his first words were, “Black Dog!”


“Jim,” he moaned, “you know I’ve been good to you. I’m pretty low
and deserted by all. You’ll help me, won’t you?”


“But the doctor—” I began.


“Doctors! What do they know?” he growled. “What does that
doctor know about seafaring men like me?”


Somewhat reluctantly, I agreed to help him. When I offered him
water, he greedily gulped it down.


“Aye,” said he, “that’s better. Now, then, did that doctor say how
long I’m supposed to lie here wasting time?”


“A week, at least,” I said.


“Thunder!” he cried. “Out of the question! They’d have the black
spot on me by then.”


He attempted to sit up but fell back, weak and helpless on the bed.
Then, after further contemplation, he spoke to me again.

                - Read pages 6 and 7 aloud.


**Inferential.** Casual language is often used to portray character. When the pirates
speak to each other in _Treasure Island_, some of the dialogue includes shortened
forms of words, slang, and incorrect grammar. An example of this is when Bill
says, “He’s a bad ’un, but there’s worse than him after me.” What does this casual
language portray about the characters?


» Answers may vary, but may include that this language shows that the pirates

are not very well-educated, they are rough around the edges, or they say things

quickly without thinking first.


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**24**


“Jim,” he said, “you saw Black Dog? He’s a bad ’un, but there’s worse
than him after me. I hope I may get away from them yet. If I can’t, and
if they put the black spot on me, it’s my old sea chest they’re after. You
go and see that doctor and tell him to send all hands— **magistrates** and
such—to the Admiral Benbow. Tell him Captain Flint’s men are here—
or all that’s left of the old crew. I was Flint’s first mate, and I’m the only
one who knows the place where he hid his **loot** . But don’t tell the doctor
unless they get me with the black spot, or you see Black Dog again—”


At that moment, he paused before continuing, “Or a seafaring
man with one leg. Keep an eye out for him above all!” he concluded.


“But what is the black spot, Captain?” I asked.


“That’s a summons, mate. **Mutiny** ! Keep your wits about you, Jim,
and I’ll share with you equals, upon my honor,” he continued.


His voice grew weaker as he said this, and soon he fell into a heavy
sleep. I should have told the story to the doctor, but my poor father died
quite suddenly that evening, which naturally put all other matters aside.


The day after my father’s funeral, I was standing at the door full of
sad thoughts when I saw a blind man slowly walking up the road. He
wore a green mask over his eyes, and he tapped the ground with a stick.
He was hunched, as if from age, and wore a hooded sea cloak.


As he drew near, he called out, “Will anyone inform a poor blind
man who has lost his sight in the defense of England—God bless King
George—where he may now be?”


“You are at the Admiral Benbow Inn,” I explained.


“I hear a young voice,” said he. “Will you lend me your hand and
lead me in?”


**7**


**Inferential.** How might you rephrase the sentence to be proper English?


» Answers may vary, but the sentence could say, “He’s a bad person, but there are

worse people coming after me.”


**Inferential.** Why is the captain trying to get away from Black Dog and other
seafaring men?


» The captain is trying to get away because, besides wanting his sea chest, the men

want to find Captain Flint’s treasure, and only he knows where it is hidden.

- Read page 8 aloud.


**Support.** Who is Bill?


» The captain, or Billy Bones.


**Inferential.** What do you think the blind man gives to the captain?


» Answers may vary, but students may deduce that it is the “black spot” (i.e., the

note or piece of paper indicating a mutiny) the captain dreaded.


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot


“Now that’s done,” said the blind man. With incredible nimbleness,
he scurried out of the inn and back along the road. I could hear his
stick tapping as he hurried away.


The captain gazed at the piece of paper the blind man had given
him.


“Ten o’clock!” he cried. “That’s six hours from now. We’ll do them yet!”
With that, he lurched forward and managed to get to his feet. Then,
quite suddenly, he reeled about and put one hand to his throat. For a
moment or two, I watched him as he swayed from side to side before
crashing to the floor. I hurried to assist him, but it was too late.


My mother descended the stairs and saw the old seaman lying on
the floor. I explained to her as best I could what had just happened.
After much discussion, we decided we should open the captain’s sea
chest and take the money he owed us. First, we had to retrieve the key
from the captain.


The captain lay on his back with his eyes open and one arm
outstretched. By his hand was the slip of paper, marked with the
anticipated black spot. Scrawled on it was the message, “You have till
ten tonight.”


I searched the dead man’s pockets, but could not discover the key
to the chest.


“Perhaps it’s ’round his neck,” suggested my mother anxiously. I
opened up his shirt, and there it was, hanging from a piece of string.


I cut the string with the old captain’s knife, and then my mother
and I raced upstairs intent upon opening the captain’s sea chest.


**9**


- Read page 9 aloud.


**Inferential.** What is this note and what does it mean?


» The note is the black spot and it means that the seafaring men are declaring a

mutiny against the captain. Based on what Bill told the narrator about the black

spot, the note is ordering Bill to appear somewhere or do something before ten

that night. If he doesn’t, the rest of the crew plan to declare a mutiny against him.

They want his sea chest and to find out where Flint’s treasure is.


**Evaluative.** Why are Jim and his mother in such a hurry to open the captain’s
sea chest?


» The captain told Jim that the other seafaring men are after his sea chest. Jim also

knows that the men will be returning at ten that night. Jim and his mother likely

want to get to the captain’s sea chest before the men return.



Support


_Mutiny_ means “a rebellion
or uprising against those in
charge on a ship.”


Support


Jim and his mother want
to open the sea chest to
retrieve the money that he
owes them.

words, or actions from the text. You may wish to elaborate on points in the
chart with the following information when discussing Jim Hawkins:


◦Jim Hawkins is the narrator of Treasure Island. He seems to be a young boy,

as he is described as having a young voice by the blind man. He lives with his
parents and helps them run the Admiral Benbow Inn. His father dies during
the first chapter. Jim seems somewhat naïve, meaning he lacks experience
or realistic judgment. He leads two seafaring men to the captain, even
though he knows the captain is trying to hide out from other seafaring men.

**Evaluative.** How does the description of the natural setting reflect the situation in
which Jim and his mother find themselves?


» Just as the storm clouds appear threatening in the sky, the appearance of the

“shadowy figures”—the pirates—threaten the safety of Jim and his mother.

Nature helps Jim and his mother. Just as they run from the house, the moon

peeps out from behind the clouds, and the moonlight allows them to see the ditch,

where they hide safely and listen.

“Search him!” shrieked the blind man. “Find the key—or you’ll
answer to me!”


There was a lengthy pause, and then another cry. “Someone got
here before us! The key’s gone!”


“Then find the sea chest and smash it to pieces!” screeched the
blind man. The sound of his voice sent a cold shiver running down
my spine.


I heard a commotion and the sound of footsteps coming from
the upstairs area of the inn. Moments later the window to the captain’s
room was flung open. Such force caused the glass to shatter and break.
Then a man with a face resembling that of an angry **gargoyle** leaned
out of the window into the moonlight.


“Pew!” he shouted. “It’s like I told ya already. Someone’s been here
before us! They rifled through Bill’s chest!”


“Is it there?” Pew roared.


“There’s some money,” said the gargoyle-faced man.


“Forget the money!” Pew spat. “Flint’s map, I mean!”


“It’s nowhere to be found, I tell ya.”


“Blast it!” cried the blind man. “It’s that boy! I should have dealt
with him earlier. He was here just a few minutes ago—I know it. Scatter,
lads, and hunt the rascal down!”


A great to-do **ensued** in our old inn. Furniture was thrown about
and beds were stripped. Doors were forcefully kicked in until finally the
men came out and declared that I was nowhere to be found.


**13**


                 - Have students read page 13 silently.


**Literal.** Describe the scene inside and outside of the inn. What is happening?


» The blind man, Pew, stays outside the inn, while the others rush inside. As the

others search the inn, they call back and forth, talking to Pew. Those inside

discover that Bill is dead and the key is missing. Pew orders them to find the sea

chest and smash it to pieces. When they locate the sea chest, they find some

money, but realize that, because the map is missing, someone else has been there

before them.

**Inferential.** Does the blind man, Pew, seem satisfied with finding the money from
the chest? Cite evidence from the text to support your answer.


» No, Pew does not seem satisfied. When told that there is some money, Pew says,

“Forget the money!” He is searching for something else: Flint’s map.


**Inferential.** Why does Pew tell the men to search for Jim?


» He suspects Jim has taken Flint’s map.


Lesson 2 The Sea Chest

Challenge


Imagery is used on page 14

to describe the pirates.
Identify the imagery and

explain its significance.


» “Pew, however, attempted
to convince the others
to hold their ground and
not flee like scalded rats”
(paragraph 3). Comparing
the men to rats suggests
that the men are cowardly.

Rats are also pests that
scavenge and feed on
trash, so this comparison
is insulting. The simile
not flee like scalded rats

helps readers visualize
the frenzied scene as men
run in fear. It sounds like
something Pew would
yell in anger at his men.

He often belittles them
to make them follow his
orders.



Just then we heard a whistle in the darkness. I guessed it was some
sort of signal. The men had left a guard, and he was warning them of
**impending** danger.


“There’s Dirk,” one of them pronounced. “We’ll have to **scarper**,
and quick, mates!”


Pew, however, attempted to convince the others to hold their
ground and not flee like scalded rats.


“The boy can’t have gone far,” he urged desperately. “That rascal was
here no more than a few minutes ago. Scatter and look for him, you lilylivered cowards! Oh, if I had my eyes, what I wouldn’t do right now!”


Two of the men obeyed Pew and began to search around the exterior
of the inn, but the others stood in the road, unsure of their next move.
Pew sensed the men’s confusion.


“Get to it!” he yelled. “If we find what we came for, we’ll all be
as rich as kings. Don’t stand there skulking! If you had the pluck of a
weevil in a biscuit, you would catch him.”


“Hang it, Pew!” grumbled one of the men. “Don’t you think we
should take the money and run?”


“He could be anywhere hereabouts,” moaned another. “Let’s call it a
day and run before we get caught!”


Pew’s anger escalated and he began swinging his walking stick. He
struck at the others right and left in his blindness. They, in turn, cursed
the blind man, threatened him in horrid terms, and tried in vain to
catch his stick and take it from him.


This quarrel saved us. For while it was raging, another sound came
from the top of the nearby hill—galloping horses. A pistol shot came


**14**


- Have students read page 14 silently.



Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**44**


from the hedge. That must have been the final signal warning the men
of serious danger, for they scattered like rabbits in every direction. In
half a minute, only Pew remained.


He tapped up and down the road in a frenzy, calling out to his
comrades.


“Johnny!” he shouted. “Black Dog! Dirk! Don’t leave old Pew here
without eyes to guide him!”


At that moment, five riders swept down the hill at full gallop. Pew
sensed he was in their path and cried out, but it was too late. One of the
horses knocked him to the ground, and another trampled over him.
Pew made one last gasp and then lay silent on the ground. I saw that the
horsemen were actually officers. One of them dismounted and checked
on Pew, but there was nothing to be done.


I jumped up out of the ditch, and after conversing with the officers
and calming my mother, I made my way to Dr. Livesey’s home.


**15**


 - Have students read page 15 silently.

**Evaluative.** What does Jim mean when he says, “This quarrel saved us”?


» The quarrel delays and confuses the men, so they don’t search far beyond the

exterior of the inn. If the men had not been delayed, they might have found Jim

and his mother hiding. During the confusion of the quarrel, there is also the sound

of galloping horses. A warning shot is fired to warn the men that they need to flee.

The Spanish Main refers
to the Spanish-claimed
lands along the coast of
South America and in
the Caribbean.



“What does it mean?” I asked.


“This is the old captain’s account book,” said the squire. “This entry
tells us that the pirates got seventy pounds of loot after they attacked a
ship off the coast of Caracas on the Spanish Main.”


Next, we inspected the sealed paper. The doctor opened it
carefully, and a map fell to the floor. It was a map of an island, labeled
with latitude and longitude, water depths, names of hills, bays, and
inlets, and all the details needed to bring a ship safely to anchorage
upon its shores.


It seemed to me that the island was shaped like a portly dragon.
From the map, we could see that the island was about nine miles long
and five wide. It had two harbors, and there was a large hill in the
center marked ‘Spyglass’.


Several things had been added to the map in red ink. There were
three crosses—two on the north part of the island and one in the
southwest. Next to one of these, written in a small, neat hand, very
different from the captain’s, were the words: _**Bulk**_ _of treasure here_ .


On the back of the map, in the same hand, we read:


_Tall tree, Spyglass shoulder, bearing a point to the N. of N.N.E._
_Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E. Ten feet. The bar silver is in the north_
_**cache**_ _. Find it by the trend of the east_ _**hummock**_ _, ten_ _**fathoms**_ _south of_
_the crag with the face on it. The arms are in the sand hill, N. point of_
_north inlet cape, bearing E. and a quarter N. —J.F._


It did not make much sense to me, but the squire was delighted.


“Tomorrow I’ll set off for Bristol,” he effused. “In ten days we’ll have
the best ship and crew in England. Hawkins shall come with us as **cabin**
**boy** . You, Livesey, will be the ship’s doctor, and I will be the admiral.

- Have students read page 18 silently, stopping before the final paragraph.


**Literal.** What do Dr. Livesey, Squire Trelawney, and Jim find in the sealed paper?

**Inferential.** How do Jim, the doctor, and the squire react to finding the
treasure map?


» Jim is confused because he doesn’t understand the directions on the map. The

squire is excited and happy. The reader does not know the doctor’s reaction, as it

is not described in the text.

same meaning as the other phrases?


Select the correct answer.


“I’ll accompany you,” said the doctor. “And I hope Jim will, too. There’s only one
man who concerns me.” ~~**[“Name the dog, sir!”]**~~ cried the squire. “You!” replied
the doctor. “You cannot ~~**[hold your tongue]**~~ . Those fellows who ransacked the inn
tonight are looking for this map—and for Flint’s treasure. We have to be extremely
careful. You go to Bristol and take my two loyal servants, Joyce and Hunter, with
you. Remember, ~~**[do not breathe a word]**~~ of what we’ve found.” “Quite right!” said

the squire. “You can rely on me to be ~~**[as silent as the grave]**~~ _!_ ”


» Correct Answer: “Name the dog, sir!”


**Inferential.** What plan does the squire propose?


» The squire proposes that he go to Bristol to get a ship and crew, and then they will

all set off in search of the treasure. He would be the admiral, Livesey would be the

ship’s doctor, and Jim would be the cabin boy.


**Inferential.** What is the doctor worried about? How do you know?


» He is worried that the squire will tell people about the treasure map. In the fourth

paragraph, it says, ‘ “You!” replied the doctor. “You cannot hold your tongue.” ‘

~~**TEKS 4.11.D.ii**~~


 - Tell students that today they will practice using the correct past-tense of
irregular verbs. Ask students what they think the word _irregular_ means.
_(Irregular means that something is not regular, or does not follow a usual_
_pattern.)_


 - Refer to the Irregular Past-Tense Verbs poster you prepared in advance.
Present the poster in the following manner:


◦Remind students that irregular verbs do not follow the normal rule for
making the word past-tense. For most verbs, adding -ed at the end of the
word makes the verb past-tense. However, some verbs are irregular, and
their past-tense forms are completely different from their present-tense
forms. Also, some past-tense forms are exactly the same as their present
tense forms.


 - Have a student read each present-tense verb, past-tense verb, and the
corresponding example sentences.


 - Have a student create one sentence orally that correctly uses an irregular
past-tense verb.


 - As time allows, have students turn to Activity Page 2.2. Tell students they will

~~**MORPHOLOGY: INTRODUCE ROOT BIO (15 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students will identify the meaning of words with the root _bio_ and

use these words correctly in sentences. ~~**[ TEKS 4.3.C ]**~~


Students will decode words using advanced knowledge of syllable division patterns

such as VV. ~~**TEKS 4.2.A.iii**~~


 - Tell students today they will learn about the Greek root bio.


 - Remind students that a root is a main element of a word that forms the base
of its meaning.


 - Write the Greek root bio on the Roots Poster displayed in the classroom from
the previous lesson and explain that it is pronounced /bie*oe/.


 - Explain that bio means “life.” Add the meaning to the poster as well.


 - Tell students that words with the root bio can be nouns, verbs, or adjectives.


 - Write biology on the board/chart paper. Briefly discuss the part of speech
and the meaning of the word. Then use it in a sentence. (Biology is a noun. It
means “the study of life.” When we learn about biology, we learn about how
plants and animals live.)


 - Model dividing the word _biology_ using the VV syllable division pattern (bi/
ol/o/gy). Explain that in the first syllable, we divide between the two vowels,
creating an open syllable in the first syllable. After the second syllable, we
divide between the consonant _l_ and vowel _o_, which creates a closed second
syllable. Next, dividing between vowel _o_ and consonant _g_, makes the third
syllable open.


Check for Understanding


Have students provide sentences using the word biology on index cards or
sticky notes. (Answers may vary.) Identify students in need of additional
support and re-teach in a small group.


**TEKS 4.3.C** Determine the meaning of and use words with affixes such as mis-, sub-, -ment, and -ity/ty and roots such as

- Write biography on the board/chart paper. Briefly discuss the part of speech
and the meaning of the word. Model dividing the word using the correct
syllable pattern (bi/og/ra/phy). Then use it in a sentence. (Biography is a
noun. It means “a history of a person’s life.” I enjoyed reading Robert Louis
Stevenson’s biography.)


Check for Understanding


Have students provide sentences using the word biography on index cards
or stick notes. (Answers may vary.) Identify students in need of additional
support and re-teach in a small group.


- Continue in this manner for the remaining bio words, using the following chart

**Lesson 2: The Sea Chest**
Writing 15m


**Primary Focus:** Students will select a setting for their original adventure story.


~~**TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.9.A; TEKS 4.11.A**~~


~~**INTRODUCE AN ADVENTURE STORY (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain that there are many types of stories, including fairy tales,

personal narratives, science fiction stories, biographies, mysteries, and
adventure stories.


 - Explain that Treasure Island is an adventure story.


 - Direct students’ attention to the Features of an Adventure Story Chart you
prepared in advance. Review the features with students by having different
students read the features aloud.






|Features of an Adventure Story|Col2|
|---|---|
|**Character(s)**|a memorable hero|
|**Setting(s)**|faraway, often imagined place|
|**Plot**|fast-paced action<br>dangerous elements<br>mystery or quest|
|**Theme**|<br>relates to characteristics demonstrated<br>by characters in the story, such as<br>bravery, trustworthiness, loyalty, etc.|




                - Explain that adventure stories have a memorable hero, who may go on a quest
or solve a mystery.


                 - Explain that adventure stories usually have a unique setting. Remind students
that the setting is where and when the story takes place.


                 - Have students identify the setting of _Treasure Island_ as it is described in the
first chapter. (Admiral Benbow Inn)


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.9.A** Demonstrate knowledge of distinguishing
characteristics of well-known children’s literature such as folktales, fables, legends, myths, and tall tales; **TEKS 4.11.A** Plan a
first draft by selecting a genre for a particular topic, purpose, and audience using a range of strategies such as brainstorming,
freewriting, and mapping.


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**58**


- Explain that adventure stories often describe a particular setting, like an inn,

but they rarely give a date or a specific place. In Treasure Island, the inn could
be anywhere in England, and Treasure Island could be anywhere in the Atlantic
Ocean. Adventure stories’ settings are both specific (an inn) and general (lack
a date or the general geographic location).


- Explain that adventure stories often take place in a faraway place and time.

They require readers to use their imaginations.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to think of other Adventure Stories they have read in the
past and identify the setting of these stories. If students have a difficult
time generating ideas, they may turn and talk with a peer, or you may
provide students with some examples (e.g., _Hatchet_, by Gary Paulsen,
takes place in the Canadian mountains).


- Ask students to think about the first two chapters of Treasure Island. Ask
whether there seems to be more focus and attention paid to the plot or the
personal feelings of the characters. (the plot)


- Ask students to provide evidence from the text that shows the action-based
plot is more important than the characters’ feelings. (The narrator focuses
on the events or action in the story. He rarely tells us how he feels, although
sometimes we can guess how he feels from his actions. For example, Jim
describes how the old captain receives the black spot and how he and his
mother hide in the ditch as the pirates ransack the inn; but he does not detail
his feelings about the events.)


- Explain that adventure stories usually involve a quest, mystery, or task that
must be accomplished by the hero of the story.


- Have students identify the mystery that must be solved in _Treasure Island_,
based on the first two chapters. (searching for and finding the buried treasure)


- Tell students that adventure stories often share common themes, which
include bravery, duty, trustworthiness, loyalty, and curiosity. Ask students if
they have noticed any of these themes so far in Treasure Island. (For example,
curiosity could be a theme in Treasure Island, as many of the characters seem
very curious about the buried treasure and its location.)


- Tell students they will write their own original adventure story over the course
of this unit.

 - Remind students that they will write an original adventure story. Tell them that
today they will choose a setting and write a character sketch.


 - Review the features of an adventure story using the displayed Features of an
Adventure Story Chart.


Check for Understanding


Have students explain how the setting in an adventure story is both
specific and general. Revisit the meaning of both specific and general
settings for the whole group if needed. (Adventure stories take place
in a particular place like an inn or on an island, but the location of that
particular inn or island is usually unknown.)


 - Tell students that to prepare to write their adventure story, they will first

choose a setting. Choosing a setting first will help them in creating a plan for
their main character using a character sketch.

 - Refer to the displayed Writing Prompt. Have one student read it aloud.


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 3.2. Have another student read the first

question on the “Setting” chart aloud.


 - If there was not sufficient time in the previous lesson for students to

brainstorm settings, have them do so quickly now. Write possible settings
on the board/chart paper (jungle, deserted island, a mountaintop, under the
ocean, the Arctic, another planet, a space station, an underground civilization,
a different period in history, etc.).


**TTEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.11.A** Plan a first draft by selecting a genre for a

Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**68**


- Choose one setting from the list and ask students what types of characters

might populate a story about that location. (For example, if the jungle is the
setting, students might list animals, such as a snake, monkey, or tiger, as
possible characters.)


- Tell students to select a setting that they would like to use for their adventure

story, keeping in mind that the setting will help determine the kind of
characters they will create. Remind them that their character will be stranded
in this location.


- Have students write the setting they will use for their adventure story in the

first row on Activity Page 3.2. Tell students to use descriptive language and be
as specific as possible in describing the setting.


- Students are expected to write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.


- Then, have students read the second question on the “Setting” chart and write

the kinds of characters that might appear in the setting they selected for their
adventure story.


~~**PLAN A CHARACTER SKETCH (30 MIN.)**~~


- Display the Character Sketch Poster you prepared in advance.


- Have students take turns reading the quotations and inferences on the
poster. Engage students in a brief discussion about some of the inferences,
discussing how the quotation led to that inference, paying particular attention
to the examples of descriptive language.


- Have students identify important details about Billy Bones that are listed in
the Character Sketch Poster (he is unique and mysterious; he is an old man
with a sabre cut scar on his cheek; his demeanor, appearance, and behavior
are frightening to those around him).


- Explain that the information in the chart is a character sketch about Billy
Bones. It explains the kind of character he is.


- Direct students’ attention back to Activity Page 3.2. Tell them to complete the
“My Character” chart on the activity page to create a character sketch about
the main character for their adventure story.


- Tell students to be as specific as possible when they describe their character.


- Remind students to use descriptive language to show rather than tell. Explain
that to show rather than tell means using descriptive language to make writing
more interesting and detailed.

but rather a likeable, clean landlord. He seems to have a positive first impression

of Long John Silver.


**Support.** How does Jim describe Long John Silver?

only one leg. He says that Long John Silver is intelligent, also noting that he talked

in a friendly way to each of the tavern guests.

Lesson 4 A Real Adventure
**81**


“What was that you said, boy?” John Silver asked. “Black what?”


“Black Dog,” I replied. “Didn’t Mr. Trelawney tell you about the
buccaneers? Black Dog was one of them.”


“Was he indeed?” cried Silver. “Black Dog, did ya say? The name’s
not familiar, yet I think I’ve seen him. He used to come here with a
blind beggar.”


“Yes!” I said. “That would be old Pew!”


“Yes!” cried Silver, his voice rising as all kinds of thoughts clearly
flooded his mind. “Pew! That were his name alright. Well, never fear,
my men will run him down.”


However, the moment I saw Black Dog in Silver’s tavern, I sensed
something was wrong. Why was he there, and was Silver telling the
truth when he said he did not know him? I watched Silver closely, but
he continued to create the impression that he was an honest man.


The two men came back, out of breath, and confessed that they
had lost Black Dog in a crowd by the quay. Silver scolded them and
shook his head in a display of disappointment.


“Well, Hawkins,” said Silver, “we had better go and tell the squire
about this, eh? Here this **scoundrel** is sitting in my house, right in front
of me. We wouldn’t want the squire to get the wrong idea now, would
we?”


As we walked along the quay, Silver proved himself a most
interesting companion. We even stopped beside a large sailing ship, as
he pointed out its different parts and the proper terms for each one. He
taught me **nautical** terms such as _fore_ and _aft_, _starboard_ and _port_ . He
showed me the forecastle at the front of the ship and the quarterdeck
toward the back. He pointed out the mainmast in the middle and the

crow’s nest on top. The crow’s nest was the spot where sailors went to
keep a lookout. He explained that the cables sailors use to raise a sail are
called halyards _._ He had me repeat these phrases till I could recite them
perfectly. I knew he was the best possible shipmate for a novice sailor
like me.


When we got to the inn, Silver gave Mr. Trelawney and Dr. Livesey
an account of all that had happened.


“I won’t stand for scoundrels of that sort in my tavern,” he said.
“But there was not much chance of me catching him myself, with this
old timber I hobble on. So I sent two of my mates after him. Thought
they might catch him, but in the end he slipped away. And that’s what
happened, isn’t it Hawkins?”


“It is,” I said.


The doctor and the squire were sorry that Black Dog had escaped,
but they agreed there was nothing else to be done.


Then Silver paid me a compliment: “This is a fine lad you’ve signed
up,” he said. “A good fellow—and smart as paint!”


I was pleased by this compliment, and I smiled as Silver hobbled
away.


“All hands on deck by four this afternoon!” the squire shouted after
him.


“Aye, aye, sir!” cried Silver.


“Well,” said Dr. Livesey to the squire. “As a rule, I don’t put much
faith in your discoveries, but this John Silver suits me.”


“Yes,” said the squire. “He’s quite a remarkable man.”


**27**


**Evaluative.** What might suggest that Jim’s positive first impression of Long John
Silver may be wrong?


» Jim sees Black Dog in Long John Silver’s tavern. This suggests that Long John

Silver might be connected to the pirates that ransacked the Admiral Benbow Inn

in Chapter 1. This could mean that Long John Silver isn’t as honest and good as

Jim first thinks.

Lesson 4 A Real Adventure

**Evaluative.** What does Jim think of Long John Silver after seeing Black Dog in
Silver’s tavern?


» Answers may vary, but should include that Jim seems to have mixed feelings,

sensing that something isn’t quite right because Black Dog was in Silver’s tavern.

On the other hand, he concludes Silver is an honest man when he sees Silver

scold the men for not catching Black Dog; Silver also tells Squire Trelawney what

happened rather than keeping it a secret. Jim also mentions that Long John

Silver takes the time during their walk to stop and teach Jim the proper terms

for parts of a sailing ship. He says later that he is pleased by Silver paying him a

compliment in front of the doctor and squire.

The captain threatens to
resign, or quit, unless Squire

Trelawney does one thing.

What is that one thing?
» keep the location of the
treasure map a secret



especially when the secret is no longer secret. Why, even a parrot seems
to know our business.”


“Do you mean Silver’s parrot?” asked the squire.


“Gentlemen, do you understand what you’re getting into?” came
the captain’s reply.


“We most certainly do!” said the squire.


“Please explain,” said Dr. Livesey, “what is it that you don’t like
about the crew?”


“I should have been able to pick them myself,” explained Captain
Smollett. “I do not approve of your officer. He’s a good seaman, but he’s
too friendly, familiar if you like, with the crew. And another thing—
the men are putting the guns and powder in the forehold. I don’t like
that. Why not put them under the cabin and give your own people the
**berths** ?”


“Is there anything else?” asked the squire.


“Yes,” said the captain. “I’ve heard the exact latitude and longitude
of our island location. I’ve heard you have a map of the island. I’ve
even heard this map shows the exact location of treasure—as all good
treasure maps should do!”


“Egad!” cried the squire. “I did not tell a soul about any of this!”


“Gentlemen,” continued the captain, “I don’t know who has this
map, but I ask that it be kept somewhere secret—even from me. If you
won’t do that much, I would ask you to let me resign.”


“I see,” said the doctor. “You are afraid the men may mutiny.”


**29**


**Evaluative.** Why is Captain Smollett upset?


» Answers may vary, but may include that Captain Smollett is upset because he

thinks treasure voyages are dangerous, especially when everyone seems to know

about the map and the location of the treasure; he doesn’t trust the crew and is

worried about the location of the guns and powder; he is concerned because he

was not able to select the crew himself and is afraid the men may mutiny.

“Sir,” said Captain Smollett. “They may be honest men, for all I
know, but I am responsible for the ship’s safety and the life of every man
aboard. I’m concerned, and I ask you to be cautious or let me resign.
That’s all.”


Trelawney grumbled, but eventually he agreed.


“I will do as you wish,” he said, sighing deeply. “But it grieves me
that you do not trust me.”


“As you please, sir,” said Captain Smollett. “You’ll find I do my
duty.” And with that, he left.


“Trelawney,” said the doctor, “I believe you have at least two good
men on board—that man and John Silver.”


“Silver, perhaps,” cried the squire, still in a huff, “but I believe
Captain Smollett to be difficult and downright rude.”


“Well,” said the doctor, “we shall see.”


Early the next morning we lifted anchor and set sail. The
_Hispaniola_ began her voyage to Treasure Island.


The _Hispaniola_ proved to be a good ship. The captain and crew
were very capable. I was especially fond of Long John Silver, or
Barbecue, as some of the men called him. He was always glad to see me
in the ship’s galley, which he kept as clean as a pin. The old sea cook
even introduced me to his pet parrot.


“This is Cap’n Flint,” he told me. “Named for the famous
buccaneer. And she predicts success for our voyage. Don’t you, Cap’n?”


I wondered at this choice of name.

 - Have students preview question 5 on Activity Page 4.2 and then read
page 30 silently.


**Literal.** What is the doctor’s opinion of Captain Smollett? What is the squire’s
opinion of the captain?


» The doctor thinks highly of Captain Smollett and says that he thinks the captain is

a good man. The squire thinks that the captain is difficult and rude.


Lesson 4 A Real Adventure
**87**


**Evaluative.** What do you think Jim means when he says he wonders about Silver’s
choice of name for his parrot, Captain Flint?


» Answers may vary, but may include that Jim might think it is odd that Long John

Silver’s parrot is named after the pirate Captain Flint. Billy Bones was Captain

Flint’s first mate, and the journey to Treasure Island is to find Captain Flint’s

buried treasure. Earlier in the story, Squire Trelawney describes Flint as “the

bloodthirstiest pirate that ever flew the Jolly Roger.” Naming a parrot after a

known pirate is not necessarily something that an average person would do. The

choice of name may also suggest Long John Silver has a connection to Captain

Flint and the treasure.

Then the parrot squawked, “Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!”


“That bird is maybe two hundred years old,” said Silver. “If
anybody’s seen more wickedness, it must be the devil himself. She
sailed with Cap’n England, the pirate. I reckon that’s how she learned
about pieces of eight.”


Silver gave the bird a lump of sugar and smiled in a way that made
me think he was either the best of men—or the worst of men.

Pieces of eight are silver
coins common in the
1600s and 1700s.



All the crewmen respected and obeyed Silver. He had a way of
talking to everybody and doing each one some particular service.


“He’s no common man, Barbecue,” Israel Hands, one of the crew,
told me. “He can speak like a book when he wants, and he’s brave—a
lion’s nothing alongside him. I’ve seen him, unarmed, grapple four men
and knock their heads together!”


I had no doubt that Silver was a man to be reckoned with.

made me think he was either the best of men—or the worst of men”?

**Challenge.** What effect is created by making Long John Silver such a mysterious
character and not revealing whether he is truly good or bad?

and makes Long John Silver interesting.

~~**CHAPTER DISCUSSION (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Bring the class back together as a group and use the following questions to
discuss the chapter:


1. **Evaluative.** Why do you think the chapter is titled “The Real

Adventure Begins”?


» Answers may vary, but should include that Jim leaves home, experiences a new

city, and meets Long John Silver. The crew and the plans for the voyage are

finalized in this chapter as well, and they set sail on their adventure.


2. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share_ . How does Jim’s view of Long John Silver vary

from the beginning to the end of the chapter?


» Although Jim is a little skeptical in the beginning, he likes and trusts Long John

Silver because he tries to catch Black Dog and he tells the squire about Black

Dog’s escape. Long John Silver also compliments Jim and spends time teaching

him nautical terms. By the end of the chapter, Jim is skeptical again, wondering

whether Long John Silver is really a good or bad person.

                       - The ball bounced down the sidewalk. (it)


                       - The men took the train. (they)


                       - My family and I went to the movies. (we)


                       - Rachel is in my class. (she)


                       - Juan likes video games. (he)


                 - Point out to students that all of these examples are subjective pronouns.
This means that the pronoun replaces a noun in the subject of the sentence.
Tell students that pronouns can also replace the object of a sentence. For
example, we could say “Juan likes them,” to replace “video games.”


                - Remind students that some pronouns show possession. Ask students
what pronouns they would use to replace the following nouns. As students
volunteer answers for each example, ask the remaining students to signal
their agreement with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down. Re-teach to the whole
group as necessary based upon student response.


                       - We visited Ben and Susie’s house. (their)


                       - My family’s trampoline is so much fun to jump on. (our)


                       - The red car is Grandma and Grandpa’s. (theirs)


                 - Refer to the Reflexive Pronouns Poster you prepared in advance, telling
students that they will learn about a new type of pronoun today.


                 - Explain that reflexive pronouns end in - _self_ or - _selves_ . What is special about
reflexive pronouns is that they show that the object of the sentence is
referring to the same person, place, or thing as another noun in the sentence.
Point out that _reflexive_ comes from the word _reflect_ . Reflexive pronouns reflect
back to another noun in the sentence.


                 - Explain that there are two main categories of relative pronouns. The first main
category is People. The relative pronouns in this category refer to or replace
nouns like _she, he, they, teacher, friend, aunt_, and so on. The relative pronouns
that refer to or replace people nouns are _who, whom_, and _whose_ .


                 - Refer to the first pair of sentences you prepared in advance. Have a student
read the sentences. Ask students how these two sentences are different. (One
says “herself” while the other says “Gloria.”)


                       - Gloria told Gloria to listen closely to the teacher.


                       - Gloria told herself to listen closely to the teacher.


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**94**


- Point to the second sentence, which uses “herself.” Draw an arrow from the
word “herself” to the word “Gloria.” Tell students that when people talk about
themselves, they usually use reflexive pronouns rather than using their own
names, like in the first sentence.


- Explain that the reflexive pronoun in this sentence is _herself_ . Underline _herself_ in
the sentence. Ask students which noun _herself_ refers to in the sentence. _(Gloria)_
_Herself_ is used in this sentence because the herself pronoun refers to or replaces
a noun in the sentence. _Gloria_ is the subject, so the reflexive pronoun is _herself_ .


- Refer to the second pair of sentences you prepared in advance. Have a student
read the sentences. Ask students how these two sentences are different. (One
says “themselves” while the other says “the students.”)


  - The teacher told the students to pack lunches for the students.


  - The teacher told the students to pack lunches for themselves.


- Tell students that the subject of the sentence is “The teacher” and the object

of the sentence is “the students.” Ask students who the reflexive pronoun
is referring to in this sentence. (The pronoun “themselves” refers to the
students.)


- Draw an arrow from the word “themselves” to the word “students.” Ask

students how the reflexive pronoun in the second pair of sentences is different
from how the pronoun was used in the first pair of sentences. (In the second
pair of sentences, the reflexive pronoun refers to the object, while in the first
sentence, it refers to the subject.)


- Refer to the third pair of sentences you prepared in advance. Have a student

read the sentences. Ask students how these two sentences are different. (One
says “himself” while the other says “the boy.”)


  - The boy taught the boy how to play chess.


  - The boy taught himself how to play chess.


- Have students turn to Activity Page 4.3. Read the directions aloud and go over

the chart with students.


- Have students complete Activity Page 4.3 for homework, or if you feel they

need more assistance, complete the activity page as a teacher-guided activity.

pronouns instead of

 - Write the following sentence on the board:


» They’re storing their camping gear over there.


 - Have a student read the sentence aloud and ask the class to identify the
homophones in the sentence.


» _they’re, their,_ and _there_


 - Circle _they’re_ in the sentence. Tell students that it is a contraction and write a

 - Ask students what two words each of the contractions combine and have
them use the contractions in sentences.


 - Ask students what two words are combined in the contraction _they’re_ .


» _They_ and _are_ .


 - Tell students that _they’re_ is only used as a contraction of _they_ and _are_ . To
figure out if _they’re_ is the correct homophone to use in a sentence, they should
substitute _they are_ and see if the sentence makes sense.


 - Circle the word _their_ and tell them it is a pronoun that shows ownership or

 - Ask students for sentences using the pronouns _my, your,_ and _their_ .


 - Tell students that in order to figure out of _their_ is the correct homophone to
use in a sentence, they should ask themselves if they want to show ownership
or possession. If so, they should use the word _their._


 - Circle the word _there_ . Tell students that the word is often used to designate
that someone or something is in or at a certain place.


 - Ask students for sentences using the word _there_ .


 - Write the following on the board:


1. they’re


2. their

~~**WRITE DESCRIPTIVE DETAILS (15 MIN.)**~~


                 - Tell students that characters come alive to readers through descriptive

language and specific details. Remind students they have used descriptive
writing in earlier units.


                 - Explain that the more specific and descriptive their writing is, the more

interesting their character will be.


                  - Tell them to use all five senses in their writing to write about how their

character looks and sounds, as well as what the character sees, hears, smells,
and touches.


                - Have one student read the sentence you prepared in advance aloud.


                       - The girl had brown hair.


                 - Ask students to revise the sentence using descriptive language, especially the
five senses, to add more details. Share their descriptions first with a partner,
then with the whole group. As students answer aloud, write their words or
phrases on the board/chart paper. Alternatively, you may have a student
record the answers. If necessary, guide students by asking some of the
following questions. Sample answers are provided as a guide.


                       - How long is her hair? (Her hair is short.)


                       - How does her hair feel? (It feels coarse and rough, as if she went swimming

and didn’t wash the chlorine out.)


                       - What kind of brown is her hair? Is it light brown, dark brown, blondish brown?

(Her hair is blondish brown, as if she has been out in the sun all summer.)


                       - What does her hair color remind you of? (Her hair is dark brown like the

**Reading**

                 - Write the following discussion questions on the board/chart paper:


                       - A simile is a comparison of two things, usually using like or as. Identify a
simile on this page.


                       - Hyperbole is figurative language that describes something in a highly

exaggerated way, or as better or worse than it really is. Identify an example
of hyperbole on this page.


                       - The idiom “a man to be reckoned with” means someone is influential,

strong, or powerful and difficult to deal with. What does it mean when Jim
thinks Silver is a man to be reckoned with?


**Writing**

                 - Ensure that students have a writing journal or paper to write on for their

Lesson 5 Interpreting Figurative Language
**103**


~~**RE-READING CHAPTER 3 (25 MIN.)**~~

                  - Read the title of the chapter as a class, “The Real Adventure Begins.” As you
read portions of the chapter, pause to explain or clarify the text at each point
indicated.

                - Have one student read the second paragraph aloud.


**Inferential.** A _simile_ is a literary device that compares two different things, usually
using _like_ or _as_ . In the last sentence of the first paragraph, a simile is used to describe
the sunrise Jim sees as he arrives in Bristol. What is the simile and what does it mean?


» The simile is “as the sun was rising like a shimmering peach above the city.” It

means as the sun rose, it looked like a peach lit up and shining in a way that the

light appears to be moving a little bit.


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**104**


**Inferential.** What effect does this simile have?


» It creates vivid imagery in the reader’s mind about what Jim saw as he arrived in

Bristol and what seeing the sunrise might have been like.


**Inferential.** What effect does the comparison of the rigging to a spider’s web have?


» It shows that the ropes look weak and thin, as though they cannot support the

weight of the men climbing on them. The image also suggests that the rigging

looks beautiful, making intricate patterns like spider webs above the ships. Such

language paints a picture for the reader and illustrates how captivated Jim is by

the quay.



Support


Rigging is the series of
ropes used on a ship to
hold up the masts and
control the sails.



Lesson 5 Interpreting Figurative Language
**105**


                 - Have students read the third paragraph silently.


**Inferential.** What does the word _emerged_ mean in the first sentence of
the paragraph? Explain how you know using evidence from the text.


» came out or appeared


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**106**


**Inferential.** A simile is a literary device that compares two different things,
usually using _like_ or _as_ . A simile in this paragraph is, ”He managed the crutch with
wonderful skill, hopping about on it like a sprightly bird.” What is compared in the
simile in this paragraph and why?


» The simile compares Long John Silver to a sprightly bird. This could be because

Long John Silver only has one leg and uses a crutch to walk, which makes

his movements jerky, like hopping. Birds also make a series of quick, small

movements when they move that look like hopping. The simile also suggests

Long John Silver uses the crutch surprisingly well. Although his movements are

different, they look natural for him.


Lesson 5 Interpreting Figurative Language
**107**


                 - Have students read page 25 silently.


**Evaluative.** When Long John Silver notices Jim has a letter from the squire, why do
you think he talks to Jim “quite loudly”?


» Answers may vary, but may include that Silver wants the people in the tavern to

hear him announce that Jim is the new cabin boy for the ship. This may be a signal

to Black Dog to flee, suggesting Silver and Black Dog are actually acquaintances

or friends, even though Silver later says he doesn’t know him. Even though Jim

doesn’t seem to suspect anything yet, the reader might be suspicious of Silver’s

motives and honesty.


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**108**


 - Have students read page 27 silently, beginning with “When we got to the inn . . .”


**Inferential.** When Long John Silver calls Jim “smart as paint,” what do you think he
means?


» Answers may vary, but may include that Long John Silver means that Jim is smart

or clever. Explain that this is also a play on the fact that smart has two meanings

that are commonly accepted in Great Britain. Not only does smart mean

intelligent in Great Britain, it also means fashionable or well-groomed. “Smart

as paint” could mean as clean and fresh-looking as a new coat of paint. This is a

playful use of words, saying that Jim is as clever as a new coat of paint is fresh.


**Evaluative.** Why might Jim be so pleased with Long John Silver’s compliment?
What does it portray about each character’s personality?


» Answers may vary, but may include that Jim wants Long John Silver’s approval

and, therefore, responds well to his flattery. Jim is young and wants to be

successful in his new job as cabin boy. He may also miss his father and be looking

for attention from an adult. Long John Silver likes to flatter those around him (he

gives everyone a merry word or a slap on the shoulder in the tavern). It is possible

that Silver compliments Jim to gain Jim’s trust and loyalty.


Lesson 5 Interpreting Figurative Language
**109**


                 - Have students read page 28 silently.


**Inferential.** Why does the squire ask Captain Smollett, “Perhaps you do not like
your employer, either?”


» Answers may vary, but may include that the squire feels insulted and defensive.

The captain has criticized the crew the squire hired for the ship. Squire Trelawney

is Captain Smollett’s employer, so the squire is implying that the captain does

not like him either. This remark shows the squire’s anger toward the captain. The

squire could be telling the captain to remember his place, reminding the captain

that he was hired by the squire, not the other way around. The squire could also be

threatening the captain, implying that he could just as easily get rid of him.


» Have students think of any questions they have about the story after reading.

Encourage a few students to share their thinking.


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**110**


~~**CHAPTER DISCUSSION (10 MIN.)**~~


- Have a student read page 33 aloud.


- Use the following questions to understand the language and Long John
Silver’s character in more depth.


1. **Literal.** A _simile_ is a comparison of two things, usually using _like_ or _as_ .
Identify a simile on this page.


» He can speak like a book when he wants.


**Inferential.** What does this _simile_ mean?


» It means Silver is well-spoken and intelligent.


2. **Literal.** _Hyperbole_ is figurative language that describes something in a highly
exaggerated way, or as better or worse than it really is. Identify an example of
hyperbole on this page.


» “. . . he’s brave—a lion’s nothing alongside him.”


**Inferential.** What does the hyperbole portray about Silver’s character?


» It emphasizes points about Silver’s character. Hands compares Silver to a lion,

saying he is braver than a beast and able to win fights against four men at a time, a

feat even more amazing considering Silver only has one leg.


3. **Inferential.** The idiom _a man to be reckoned with_ means someone is
influential, strong, or powerful and difficult to deal with. What does it mean
when Jim thinks Silver is a man to be reckoned with?


» Jim suspects Silver is not the honest man he appears to be. Even though he is

hired as the ship’s cook, Jim thinks he has the potential to be difficult to deal with

and to have a powerful influence on events.


- Tell students they will take home Activity Page 5.1 to read and complete
for homework. Explain that the Activity Page provides activities related to the
vocabulary in the text. Remind students that they can use the context of the
sentences to help them understand vocabulary. They can also make use of
print and digital resources to help them find the meanings of words.

Lesson 6 The Apple Barrel
**121**


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**122**


While I was sitting in the barrel, comparing the quality of two
apples, several members of the crew arrived. They were talking, and
before I had heard a dozen words, my mood changed to one of fear
and anxiety. You see, their conversation revealed that the lives of all the
honest men aboard the _Hispaniola_ depended upon me.


“No, not I,” said Silver. “Flint was cap’n and I was part of the crew.
I lost my leg on that voyage, and old Pew lost his eyes. But I got my
hands on some money, and it’s all safe in the bank. You see, boys, it’s not
earning that does it—it’s saving.”


Another seaman mumbled something I could not hear.


“Look here, mate,” Silver said in reply, “you’re young, but you’re as
smart as paint, and I’ll talk to you like a man.”


You can imagine how I felt when I heard those words “smart as
paint,” as that was what Silver had said about _me_ that day in Bristol! In
fact, those were his exact words! I wanted to pounce on him, but he was
unaware that I was listening, and he continued to speak.


“Gentlemen of fortune live rough, and they risk death every day,”
Silver explained. “But when a cruise is done, they’ve got money in their
pockets. Most spend it carelessly, but that’s not the course for me. I put
it all away. I’m fifty years old now. Once I get back from this cruise, I’ll
set myself up as a gentleman. My missus has gathered up all my money.
She’s sold the Spyglass by now, and I’ll meet up with her when I return.”


“Well,” said one of the men named Dick, “I didn’t like this job till I
had this talk with you, but now things are startin’ to look up! Here’s my
hand on it, John!”


“A brave lad you are!” Silver answered. “And smart, too!”


**36**


Lesson 6 The Apple Barrel
**123**


By this time I understood what was happening. By “gentlemen of
fortune,” Silver meant pirates, and he had just convinced another one of
the honest men to join the mutiny he was planning.


Silver gave a little whistle and a third man joined them.


“Dick’s square,” said Silver to the newcomer.


“I knew he was no fool!” said the other. “But here’s what I want to
know, Barbecue: When will we strike? I’ve had more than enough of
Captain Smollett.”


“Listen, Israel,” said Silver. “Keep your eyes peeled till I give the
order.”


I concluded that the new arrival must be Israel Hands.


“I don’t say _no_,” Hands growled, “but I say _when?_ ”


“At the last possible moment, that’s _when_,” replied Silver. “We’ve got
a first-rate captain sailing the ship for us, and the squire and the doctor
have Flint’s map. We’ll let them find the treasure and haul it onboard.
Then we’ll strike.”


“And what will we do with them?” asked Dick.


“Well,” said Silver, “we could leave them on the island,
**marooned** —or we could cut ’em down. That’s what Flint would have
done—and Billy Bones, too.”


“Billy was the man for that,” added Hands. “‘Dead men don’t bite,’
he used to say. If ever a rough man came to port, it was Billy Bones!”


“Rough and ready,” said Silver, “and on this point, I agree with him.
When I’m a rich man, back in England and riding in my coach, I don’t

was cap’n and I was part of the crew. I lost my leg on that voyage, and old Pew lost his
eyes. But I got my hands on some money, and it’s all safe in the bank”? (page 36)


» Long John Silver knows all of the pirates who tried to steal the treasure map

from the Admiral Benbow Inn, as described in earlier chapters. He was actually

a member of the crew on the original voyage, when the treasure was hidden

and buried.

Remind students that “as
smart as paint” is a simile.




- Have students record the answer(s) to question 1 on Activity Page 6.2.


**Evaluative.** Why do you think Jim says he wants to pounce on Silver when he hears
Silver say, “you’re as smart as paint” to another crew member? (page 36)


» Jim wants to pounce on Silver because he is angry when he realizes that Silver

is not the honest man Jim believed him to be. Silver had complimented Jim by

calling him “smart as paint” when they were in Bristol. This made Jim feel special,

which made him like Silver. Now it is obvious to Jim that Silver says things like that

just to get people on his side, and he really does not mean what he says. Jim feels

tricked and deceived.


- Have students record the answer(s) to question 2 on Activity Page 6.2.


**Inferential.** Why does Jim’s mood turn to fear and anxiety after he overhears the
conversation among the crew? (page 36)


» He discovers that Long John Silver is a dishonest man, and that he is organizing

a mutiny. He has convinced other members of the crew to join him. Silver plans

to steal the treasure once the captain, the doctor, the squire, and the honest

members of the crew bring it on board the ship.


**Evaluative.** Why do you think Silver suddenly breaks off when he is talking about
what he will do to other members of the crew once the treasure is found? (page 38)
Have a few students share their thinking with the whole group. Ask students to
signal their agreement with the answers given with a thumbs-up/thumbs-down.
Redirect students back into the text and clarify as needed.


» Answers may vary, but may include that perhaps Silver thinks he has already said

too much about his plans to steal the treasure and get rid of the other members

of the crew. Perhaps he wants to change the topic or distract the others so he

doesn’t reveal anything else he is thinking of doing, in case the men he is speaking

with tell others about his plans.

 - Have students preview question 4 on Activity Page 6.2 and then read the rest
of page 38 and page 39 aloud.


**Inferential.** Why does Captain Smollett have a copy of the map that does not show
where the treasure is buried?


» Answers may vary, but should include that Captain Smollett asks early on that the

treasure map be hidden from the crew, including himself. The captain suspects

some of the crew may be dishonest, so he likely made a copy of the map to

protect the actual location of the treasure from people who likely can’t be trusted,

including Silver.

Lesson 6 The Apple Barrel
**127**


“Yes, sir,” he said. “This is the spot—and I believe the best
anchorage is right over here in this little cove.”


I was surprised at the coolness with which Silver declared his
knowledge of the island. I had, by this time, such a fear of his cruelty
and **duplicity** that I could scarcely conceal a shudder when he called
out, “Ahoy there, Jim!” and laid his hand on my shoulder.


“This island is a sweet spot for a lad,” Silver said. “When you want
to do a bit of exploring, just ask old John, and I’ll fix up a snack for you
to take along.”


After Silver hobbled off, I met with the captain, the doctor, and the
squire. I proceeded to tell them everything I had heard. Everyone sat
quietly for a few moments until, at last, the squire broke the silence.


“Captain,” he said, “I believe I owe you an apology. You were right,
and I was wrong. I await your orders.”


“Well,” said the captain, “I accept your apology, but now I must
present to you my opinion of our current **predicament** . I see three or
four important points for our consideration. First, we can’t turn back.
If I gave orders to go back, Silver and the others would mutiny at once.
Second, we have some time—at least until the treasure’s found. Third,
we will come to blows sooner or later. What I propose is that we choose
a time to fight when they least expect it. I take it we can count on your
servants—Hunter, Joyce, and Redruth—Mr. Trelawney?”


“As upon myself,” declared the squire.


“That’s three honest men,” said the captain. “Ourselves make seven,
counting Hawkins here. Now, what about the others?”


“I fancy we can also count on the men Trelawney hired,” said the

and 41 aloud.


**Inferential.** Why does Captain Smollett want Silver to get the dishonest members
of the crew under his control?


» The captain is concerned the men may begin to fight among themselves,

overthrow Silver, and mutiny on their own. If Silver can talk them out of beginning

the mutiny now, it will give the captain more time and more control.

doctor. “I mean the men he found by himself before Silver intervened.”


“Nay,” replied the squire. “Hands was mine.”


“Well, gentlemen,” said the captain, “we must determine who can
be trusted.”


I felt helpless. There were only seven out of twenty-six who were
known to be good—and one of those was me, a young boy.


Silver helped the captain guide the _Hispaniola_ to the best
anchorage. He knew the passage like the palm of his hand and never
hesitated once. Still, there were problems afoot. Discipline had begun
to break down. The men were now unfriendly and unwilling to take
orders. They seemed to be on the verge of mutiny. Only Silver showed
a willingness to obey. When an order was given, he was on his crutch
in an instant with a cheery, “Aye, aye, sir!” and, when there was nothing
else to do, he sang old sea songs.


The captain called a meeting with our group in his cabin.


“Gentlemen,” he said, “we are in a real pickle here. I believe that if I
continue to command this ship, the men will mutiny. If I don’t, Silver will
know that something is up. I believe there’s only one thing to do.”


“What’s that?” inquired the squire.


“Leave things to Silver,” the captain replied. “He’s as anxious as we
are to cover things up. He doesn’t want the men to mutiny—at least not
yet—and I say we give him a chance to talk them out of it. Let’s allow
the men to go ashore if they like. Then Silver can talk with them and
get them under his control. If they go, you mark my words, Silver will
get them back in line. He’ll bring ’em on board again, mild as lambs.”

are alone on the island, Silver will have time to convince them all to wait to mutiny.

~~**CHAPTER DISCUSSION (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Bring the class back together as a group and use the following questions to
discuss the chapter:


1. **Evaluative.** Conflict is a literary device often used by authors, in which

something stands in the way of the main character achieving their goal.

Why might this chapter be an example of conflict?


» Jim, the narrator and main character, finds out that many members of the crew

are disloyal. They are planning a mutiny. Jim, the squire, the doctor, and the

captain now must face the dangerous possibility of a mutiny. They will no longer

be able to easily and safely get the treasure and go back home. They have to deal

with enemies who are planning to fight them for the treasure.


2. **Inferential.** At the end of Chapter 3, Jim is unsure about Long John Silver’s

character, or morals. Is Jim still unsure about Silver at the end of this

chapter? How do you know?


» No, after he overhears Silver’s plan to overthrow the crew and steal the treasure,

Jim knows Silver is not honest.

or three students share their sentences aloud. Ask all other students if they
believe the word was used properly by signaling with a thumbs-up/thumbs­
down. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to make
complete sentences: “ is a predicament.”

~~**GRAMMAR: REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS (15 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students will edit sentences using reflexive pronouns
correctly. ~~**TEKS 4.11.D.vii**~~


                - Refer to the Reflexive Pronouns Poster on display. Remind students that

a reflexive pronoun is used when the object of the sentence is referring to
the same person, place, or thing as another noun in the sentence. Remind
students that reflexive pronouns end in - _self_ or - _selves_


                 - Ask students to answer an Inline Choice Question.


~~**TEKS 4.11.D.vii**~~


Ravi wants to use a reflexive pronoun to edit his sentence. Select the response that
correctly uses relative pronouns.


**TEKS 4.11.D.vii** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including pronouns, including reflexive cases.


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**134**


My father told my sister that she needed to clean up after [_____].


   - myself


   - ourselves


   - herself


   - itself


     - Correct Answer: herself


 - Remind students that reflexive pronouns can replace a noun that was already
used in the sentence. Tell students that relative pronouns can also be used to
show that someone did something without anyone else’s help.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to create a sentence that correctly uses a reflexive pronoun.
Review reflexive pronouns as needed in a small group or all together.


 - Refer to the first sentence you prepared in advance. Have a student read the

sentences aloud.

   - I will fix the bike on my own without any help.

 - Ask students what parts of this sentence sound repetitive _(on my own_ and

_without any help)_ . Then, ask students how they could use a reflexive pronoun
to make this sentence more concise _(I will fix the bike myself; I will fix the bike_
_by myself)._


 - Refer to the second sentence you prepared on the board/chart paper. Have a

student read the sentence.


   - The caterpillar spun a cocoon around the caterpillar’s own body.


 - Ask students what parts of this sentence sound repetitive _(the caterpillar’s_

_own body)_ . Then, ask students how they could use a reflexive pronoun to make
this sentence more concise _(The caterpillar spun a cocoon around itself)_ . Write
the following sentence on the board/chart paper.


   - The caterpillar spun a cocoon around itself.


 - Explain that the reflexive pronoun in this sentence is _itself_ . Underline _itself_ in
the sentence. Ask students what _itself_ refers to in the sentence. ( _caterpillar_ )
_Itself_ is used in this sentence because it refers to an insect instead of a person.
Point out that in this case, the reflexive pronoun refers to the subject of the
sentence _(The caterpillar)_ . Draw an arrow from _itself_ to _caterpillar_ .


Lesson 6 The Apple Barrel
**135**


Challenge


Point out the apostrophe
in this sentence.
Remind students that
an apostrophe shows
possession. In this
sentence, the apostrophe

   - _s_ tells us that the body
belongs to the caterpillar,
so we know that we can use

a reflexive pronoun instead

of repeating the noun.

 - Refer to the third sentence you prepared on the board/chart paper. Have a
student read the sentence. Ask students how they think we should edit the
sentence _(change themselves to himself)_ .


  - Antonio’s mom said he could ride his bike to a friend’s house all by
themselves.


 - Edit the two sentences into one sentence by writing the following on the
board/chart paper:


  - Antonio’s mom said he could ride his bike to a friend’s house all by himself.


 - Ask students which reflexive pronoun appears in this sentence ( _himself_ ).
Underline _himself_ in the sentence. Ask students what _Antonio_ refers to in the
sentence ( _he_ ). Draw an arrow from _himself_ to _he_ . Explain that in this sentence,
we know that he is referring to Antonio. Tell students that it is important to
consider which noun the reflexive pronoun is referring to, because we would
use different pronouns if it were referring to _Antonio’s mom_ or _a friend’s_
_house_ . _Himself_ is used in this sentence because it refers to one person,
while _themselves_ refers to more than one person. _Himself_ is singular, while
_themselves_ is plural.

the chart with students.


 - Have students complete Activity Page 6.3 for homework, or, if you feel they

~~**MORPHOLOGY: PREFIXES AND ROOTS (15 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students will use the prefixes _im_ - and _in_ - and the roots _port_ and

_bio_ to understand the meaning of words. ~~**TEKS 4.3.C**~~


 - Tell students that today they will review prefixes and roots covered in previous
lessons and units.


 - Refer to the Prefixes Poster on display in the classroom and read it. Focus on
the prefixes _im–_ and _in–_, reminding students that they are of Latin origin. Both
mean “not.” Point out that _im–_ is pronounced /im/ and _in–_ is pronounced
/in/.


 - Remind students that adding _im–_ or _in–_ does not change the part of speech of
the root word, but it does change the meaning of the root word.


 - Write _mature_ on the board/chart paper. Briefly discuss the part of speech
and meaning of the word. Then use it in a sentence. ( _Mature_ is an adjective
meaning “fully grown, developed, or thought out.” Once the seeds grew into
mature plants, we took them out of pots and planted them in the ground.)



~~**ELPS 4.C; ELPS 5.E**~~ **TEKS 4.3.C** Determine the meaning of and use words with affixes such as mis-, sub-, -ment, and -ity/ty and roots such as
auto, graph, and meter.


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**136**


 - Add the prefix _im–_ to mature. Have students read the new word; then, discuss
the part of speech and the meaning of the word, and use it in a sentence.
( _Immature_ is an adjective meaning “not fully grown, developed, or thought
out.” The fruit they picked was immature and not ripe yet, so it didn’t taste
very good.)


 - Write _dependent_ on the board/chart paper. Briefly discuss the part of speech
and meaning of the word. Then use it in a sentence. ( _Dependent_ is an adjective
meaning “relying on someone or something else.” We couldn’t drive, so we
were dependent on them for a ride around town.)


 - Add the prefix _in–_ to dependent. Have students read the new word; then,
discuss the part of speech and the meaning of the word. Then use it in a
sentence. ( _Independent_ is an adjective meaning “not relying on someone or
something else.” When he went on a trip to Germany by himself, he felt very
independent.)


 - Refer to the Roots Poster on display in the classroom and read it. Focus on the
root _port,_ reminding students that it is of Latin origin. It means “to carry” and
is pronounced /port/.


 - Write _important_ on the board/chart paper. Briefly discuss the part of speech
and meaning of the word. Then use it in a sentence. ( _Important_ is an adjective
meaning “carrying great power, influence, or significance.” Getting an
education is important to your future success.)


 - Remind students that _bio_ is of Greek origin. It means “life” and is pronounced
/bie*oe/.

 - Write _biodiversity_ on the board. Briefly discuss the part of speech and the
meaning of the word. Then use it in a sentence. ( _Biodiversity_ is a noun
meaning “a variety of plant and animal life in a particular place.” A rainforest is
an ecosystem with biodiversity because so many different plants and animals
live there.)

 - Have students engage in a choral response to the questions below. Review
meanings of prefixes and roots as needed.

1. What does the prefix – _im_ mean?


» not


2. What does the prefix – _in_ mean?


» not


3. What does the root _port_ mean?


» to carry


4. What does the root _bio_ mean?


» life

~~**SPELLING: INTRODUCE SPELLING WORDS (15 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students will apply grade-level phonics and word-analysis skills to

spell targeted words. ~~**[ TEKS 4.2.A.i; TEKS 4.2.B.iii ]**~~


                 - Explain that students will practice 10 words related to the content of the

proves they cannot be trusted; Silver plans to lead a mutiny and take the treasure

once the honest men find it and bring it on board the ship; Jim meets with the

captain, the doctor, and the squire to tell them what he heard; they decide to let

the dishonest men go ashore upon reaching the island in hopes that this will give

Silver an opportunity to convince the men not to mutiny yet; Jim decides to sneak

ashore in one of the boats.

**Inferential.** Remind students that often, casual language is used to portray
characters. When the pirates speak to each other in _Treasure Island_, some of the
dialogue includes shortened forms of words, slang, and incorrect grammar. Which
sentences use casual language or slang in this paragraph? How can you rephrase
these examples using proper English?


» Answers may vary, but students may select the sentence, “Skeleton Island, they

calls it. It were a main hideout for pirates once.” A possible rephrasing could be,

“They call it Skeleton Island. It was a main hideout for pirates once.” Or, “It is called

Skeleton Island. It was once a main hideout for pirates.”


**Inferential.** What effect does the use of this casual language have here?


» Answers may vary, but may include that casual language shows the difference

between Long John Silver and Captain Smollett in terms of how they speak. It may

suggest that the captain is well-educated and a proper gentleman, while Silver is

less educated and is rougher around the edges.

_Cool_ is a multiplemeaning word. It is often
used to describe the
temperature of something
as being a little cold. Here,
it means to act in a calm
way. Why is Silver acting
cool, or in a calm way?


» He doesn’t want the
captain to know he is up
to something.



“Yes, sir,” he said. “This is the spot—and I believe the best
anchorage is right over here in this little cove.”


I was surprised at the coolness with which Silver declared his
knowledge of the island. I had, by this time, such a fear of his cruelty
and **duplicity** that I could scarcely conceal a shudder when he called
out, “Ahoy there, Jim!” and laid his hand on my shoulder.


“This island is a sweet spot for a lad,” Silver said. “When you want
to do a bit of exploring, just ask old John, and I’ll fix up a snack for you
to take along.”


After Silver hobbled off, I met with the captain, the doctor, and the
squire. I proceeded to tell them everything I had heard. Everyone sat
quietly for a few moments until, at last, the squire broke the silence.


“Captain,” he said, “I believe I owe you an apology. You were right,
and I was wrong. I await your orders.”


“Well,” said the captain, “I accept your apology, but now I must
present to you my opinion of our current **predicament** . I see three or
four important points for our consideration. First, we can’t turn back.
If I gave orders to go back, Silver and the others would mutiny at once.
Second, we have some time—at least until the treasure’s found. Third,
we will come to blows sooner or later. What I propose is that we choose
a time to fight when they least expect it. I take it we can count on your
servants—Hunter, Joyce, and Redruth—Mr. Trelawney?”


“As upon myself,” declared the squire.


“That’s three honest men,” said the captain. “Ourselves make seven,
counting Hawkins here. Now, what about the others?”


“I fancy we can also count on the men Trelawney hired,” said the

to the captain.

Check for Understanding


There is a lot of information in the second sentence of the second
paragraph. Let’s unpack this sentence so we can understand it all.
Ask each question and have students share ideas with a peer. Ask a
few students to share their thinking aloud with the whole group. Bring
students back into the text to help them answer difficult questions.


**Inferential.** When Jim says, “I had, by this time, such a fear of his cruelty and
duplicity . . .,” what does he mean?


» Jim means now that he knows Silver is dangerous and not trustworthy, he is afraid

of Silver.


**Inferential.** What does it mean when Jim says, “I could scarcely conceal
a shudder”?


» It means he could barely hide that he shakes with fear when Silver says his name.


**Inferential.** The last part of the sentence says “ . . . laid his hand on my shoulder.”
_Laid_ is the past tense of the verb _lay_, which is used here to mean “place” or “put.”
Why would Jim be afraid when Silver places his hand on Jim’s shoulder?


» Jim knows Silver is a dishonest man and that he is planning to mutiny. Jim is

afraid of what Silver might do to him because Jim doesn’t trust Silver.

doctor. “I mean the men he found by himself before Silver intervened.”


“Nay,” replied the squire. “Hands was mine.”


“Well, gentlemen,” said the captain, “we must determine who can
be trusted.”


I felt helpless. There were only seven out of twenty-six who were
known to be good—and one of those was me, a young boy.


Silver helped the captain guide the _Hispaniola_ to the best
anchorage. He knew the passage like the palm of his hand and never
hesitated once. Still, there were problems afoot. Discipline had begun
to break down. The men were now unfriendly and unwilling to take
orders. They seemed to be on the verge of mutiny. Only Silver showed
a willingness to obey. When an order was given, he was on his crutch
in an instant with a cheery, “Aye, aye, sir!” and, when there was nothing
else to do, he sang old sea songs.


The captain called a meeting with our group in his cabin.


“Gentlemen,” he said, “we are in a real pickle here. I believe that if I
continue to command this ship, the men will mutiny. If I don’t, Silver will
know that something is up. I believe there’s only one thing to do.”


“What’s that?” inquired the squire.


“Leave things to Silver,” the captain replied. “He’s as anxious as we
are to cover things up. He doesn’t want the men to mutiny—at least not
yet—and I say we give him a chance to talk them out of it. Let’s allow
the men to go ashore if they like. Then Silver can talk with them and
get them under his control. If they go, you mark my words, Silver will
get them back in line. He’ll bring ’em on board again, mild as lambs.”

a mutiny.

opposed to the use of “He knew the passage well”?


» The figurative language is more descriptive and helps convey how well Silver

knows the passage; he knows it very well, just like he knows his own hand

very well.


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**150**


- Have students read the rest of page 41 silently.


**Inferential.** _We are in a real pickle_ is an idiom that means, “We are in a difficult
situation.” How does the vocabulary word _predicament_ relate to the meaning of
this idiom?


» _Predicament_ means “in a dangerous or difficult situation,” which is very similar to

the idiom _we are in a real pickle_ .


**Inferential.** In the final paragraph, the simile “He’ll bring ’em on board again, mild
as lambs” is used. How does this simile help the reader understand the expected
behavior of the men after Silver talks to them?


» Lambs are very mild animals; if Silver can get the men to be mild as lambs, it

means he will calm them down and they will no longer be ready to rebel.



Support


The idiom _mark my words_
means someone is positive
that what they just said will
happen.

                 - Have students read page 42 silently.


**Inferential.** What do you think the phrase “taken into our confidence” means?


» It means Jim, the squire, captain, and doctor trust the other honest crew

members enough to tell them what is going on and trust that they will still be loyal

after they learn about what is being planned.


**Inferential.** What does the narrator mean when he says, “the men must have
thought they would trip over treasure as soon as they landed”?


» The narrator means that the men think the treasure will be easy to find

and plentiful.

**152**


~~**CHAPTER DISCUSSION (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Use the following question to discuss the chapter:


1. **Inferential.** _Think-Pair-Share._ Why does Jim think it would be more useful

for him to go ashore than to stay aboard the ship?


» He thinks it would be more useful to explore the island and perhaps keep an eye

on what Silver and his men are doing. Also, because Silver does not leave very

many men behind, Jim is confident that the men left behind on the ship will not try

to do anything to the ship or the others on it.


~~**WORD WORK: DUPLICITY (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the chapter, you read, “I had, by this time, such a fear of his cruelty and
duplicity that I could scarcely conceal a shudder when he called out, ‘Ahoy
there, Jim!’ and laid his hand on my shoulder.”


2. Say the word _duplicity_ with me.


3. _Duplicity_ means “dishonest behavior meant to trick someone.”


4. The spy used his duplicity to learn secrets from the enemies.


5. What are some other examples of duplicity?


 - Be sure to use the word _duplicity_ in your response. Ask two or three students

to use the target word in a sentence. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase
students’ responses to make complete sentences: “An example of duplicity
is .”


6. What part of speech is the word _duplicity_ ?


» noun

**Note:** Use a Making Choices activity for follow-up.

 - Tell the students: “I will read several sentences. If the sentence I read is an
example of duplicity, say, ‘That is duplicity.’ If the sentence I read is not an
example of duplicity, say, ‘That is not duplicity.’”


1. The spy sneaked behind enemy lines to get information that helped the army
win the war.


» That is duplicity.


2. The children told their parents the truth about what happened when the
window broke.

 - Tell students that today they will begin planning their adventure story.



45m




                  - Explain that all stories have a shape or structure. Explain that you will use
_Treasure Island_ to model how a story is organized.


                 - Direct students’ attention to the Shape of a Story chart you prepared in
advance. Ask students what the chart resembles.


» a mountain


                - Tell students the shape illustrates how suspense increases and decreases
in a story. Explain that suspense is a feeling of excitement or nervousness
caused by wondering what will happen. Explain that a story starts off flat, with
minimal suspense, and gradually increases in suspense until the end, when
the problem in the story is resolved.


                  - Point to the “Introduction” line. Explain that the “Introduction” line is flat
because it does not increase suspense. An introduction establishes the
setting, introduces the main characters, and captures the reader’s attention.


                  - Explain that, in most stories, the introduction is part of the beginning of
the story.

such as personal narratives and poetry using genre characteristics and craft.


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**154**


Check for Understanding


Have students recall what happens in the introduction to _Treasure Island_ .


» Several characters are introduced, including Jim Hawkins (the

narrator), Billy Bones, and Black Dog. The setting is established—The

Admiral Benbow Inn. The reader’s attention is captured by interesting

characters and elements of danger, such as the sea chest and the

sudden death of Billy Bones.


 - Explain that the second part of a story is the problem or conflict.


 - Have students identify the problem or conflict at the beginning of
_Treasure Island_ .


   - The pirates and the honest men are searching for the same buried treasure.

Students may also say the first problem is that Billy Bones is a hunted man.


 - Explain that the third part of a story is called Rising Action. Tell students that
Rising Action occurs as the story becomes more exciting or the problem
worsens.


 - Explain that _Treasure Island_ is a relatively long story, so there are many points
of Rising Action. Shorter stories, like the one they will write, will have fewer
points of Rising Action.


 - Have students brainstorm some of the events in _Treasure Island_ that might
be Rising Action. Because students have read only through Chapter 4 at this
point, be sure not to give away any plot twists.


   - Events so far: Trelawney goes to Bristol to find a ship and crew; Jim gets to

know Long John Silver and wonders if he is trustworthy; Captain Smollett
doesn’t trust the crew; the _Hispaniola_ sets sail; Jim overhears Long John
Silver convincing some members of the crew to mutiny; Jim tells Trelawney
and Livesey what he overheard, and they form a plan.


 - Explain that because they have not yet read the entire story, students are not
yet able to identify parts of the story that align with the rest of the chart.


 - Tell students that all stories have a turning point or climax. This occurs when
the problem is addressed. It is the most exciting point in the story.

**164**


All of a sudden, he was interrupted. Faraway out in the marsh
arose an angry roar, then another. Tom jumped at the sound, like a
horse pricked by a rider’s spurs, but Silver winked not an eye. He stood
resting lightly on his crutch, watching his companion, like a snake
about to strike.


“John!” said Tom, “what was that?”


“That?” said Silver, with a **treacherous** smile. “Oh, I reckon that
was Alan.”


Then Tom seemed to understand everything all at once.


“Alan!” he cried, fearing the worst for his friend. “Well, John
Silver, you’re no mate of mine, and that’s a fact! I’ll have no part in
your mutiny.”


With that, the brave fellow turned his back on the cook and set off
toward the beach, but he was not destined to go far. With a cry, Silver
seized the branch of a tree, whipped the crutch from under his armpit,
and sent the missile hurtling through the air. It struck poor Tom right
between the shoulders in the middle of his back. His hands flew up, he
let out a gasp, and fell.


I felt faint. The whole world seemed to swim before me in a
whirling mist. When I gathered my courage to look again, I saw Silver
standing next to Tom, who was motionless on the ground.


A moment later, Silver pulled out a whistle and blew upon it. I
guessed he was calling the other pirates, and I was worried they might
find me. I crawled out of the undergrowth and ran as fast as I could. It
was all over for me, I thought. I would be captured by the mutineers.


**45**


The following guided reading supports are intended for use with Small Group 1.


**Literal.** How does the reader know the exchange between John Silver and the
seaman Tom takes place?


» The narrator, Jim, witnesses the exchange from a distance. He hides in a nearby

area, watching and listening to them.


**Inferential.** What do you think is the narrator’s main point in describing this
interaction? Why is the interaction important?


» The narrator’s main point in describing the interaction is to confirm that Long

John Silver is planning to lead a mutiny. This interaction is important because

it shows Long John Silver is willing to hurt people who are not willing to join his

mutiny as well as those who might go against him.

 - Have students record the answer(s) to question 1 on Activity Page 8.2.


Lesson 8 The Man on the Island
**165**


I ran without knowing where I was going, until a new alarm
brought me to a standstill. With a thumping heart, I saw a dark shaggy
figure leap behind a tree trunk. Was it a bear? Or a monkey? I could not
tell, but I was afraid because I was now cut off on both sides. Behind me
were the ferocious pirates, and in front of me, the lurking creature.


The figure flitted from trunk to trunk like a deer, but it ran on two
legs like a man. I was tempted to cry for help, when another sighting
reassured me that the creature was indeed a man. I took some comfort
in this discovery, and in the fact I had just remembered I carried a
pistol in my pocket. I put one hand on my pistol and took a few steps
forward. At that precise moment, the man leaped out in the open,
threw himself on his knees, and held out his hands as if begging
for mercy.


I could see that he was an Englishman like myself, but his clothes
were old and tattered, and his skin had been burned by the sun. In fact,
his bright eyes looked quite startling on a face so burned.


“Who are you?” I demanded.


“I’m Ben Gunn, I am,” he replied. His voice sounded like a rusty
lock. “I haven’t spoken with a man for three years! I am surprised I still
know how to speak.”


“Three years?” I cried. “Were you **shipwrecked** here?”


“Nay, friend,” said he. “I was marooned.”


I had heard the word, and I knew it stood for a horrible kind
of punishment common enough among buccaneers. It was my
understanding that when a person is marooned, he is abandoned on a
**desolate** island with not much to rely on other than his wits.


**46**


                - Have students preview question 2 on Activity Page 8.2 and then read pages 46
and 47 silently.


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**166**


**Inferential.** Who is Ben Gunn?


» Ben Gunn is an English buccaneer who has been marooned on Treasure Island for

three years.


**Inferential.** What do you think Ben Gunn means when he says, “If I ever get back
to England, I’m changing my ways and the company I keep”? As needed, guide
students in a discussion of what Ben Gunn’s “ways” may have been like prior to
being marooned on the island. Ask what kind of company he kept in the past and
how he plans to change in the future.


» Ben Gunn was a pirate until another group of pirates marooned him on the island.

When he says he’s going to change his ways, he means that he is going to stop

being a buccaneer. When he says he will change the company he keeps, he means

that he will not associate with pirates anymore.

**167**


“And, Jim . . .” he continued, looking around and lowering his voice
to little more than a whisper. “I’m rich! You’ll thank your lucky stars,
you will, that you was the first that found me!”


Then a shadow passed over his face, and he took hold of my hand
and raised one finger threateningly before my eyes.


“Now, Jim,” he said, “tell me true. Is that Flint’s ship you came on?”


“No,” I replied. “It’s not Flint’s ship. Flint is dead, but we have some
of his men with us.”


“Not a man . . . with . . . one leg?” he gasped.


“John Silver?” I asked.


“Yes, that were his name,” he said anxiously.


After talking with Ben Gunn for a few minutes, I no longer feared
him. In fact, I told him the story of our voyage, and he heard it with the
keenest of interest.


“Well,” he said, “you and your friends are in a pinch, ain’t you?
Well, never you mind. Just put your trust in Ben Gunn. But tell me one
thing—is this squire of yours an honest man?”


“Yes,” I said.


“Suppose I gave him a share of my money. Do you think he would
let me sail home with you?” he asked.


“I’m sure he would,” I replied. He seemed greatly relieved to hear
this.


“Well, then,” he went on, “I’ll tell you my story. I was on Flint’s ship
when he buried his treasure. He went ashore on this very island, with

six strong men. They were ashore nearly a week, and left the rest of us
on the ship. Eventually, Flint came back, all by himself. There he was!
And the six men? All dead. How he done it, not a man aboard could
make out. Billy Bones was the mate back then, and Silver was also part
of the crew.


“Then, three years back, I was on another ship, and we sighted
this island. ‘Boys,’ said I, ‘this is where Flint buried his treasure. Let’s go
ashore and find it!’ Twelve days we spent lookin’ for it. Then the others
gave up and went back aboard. ‘As for you, Benjamin Gunn,’ says they,
‘here’s a musket, and a spade, and a pickaxe. You can stay here and find
Flint’s money for yourself.’”


“Well, Jim, that’s my story. Now, be a good lad and run and speak
with the squire. Tell him I know this island like it’s my own.”


“How am I to get back to the ship?” I asked.


“You can use my boat,” he said. “I made it with my own two hands.
I keep it under a white rock along the shore.”


Then, quite suddenly, we heard the boom of a cannon.


“They’ve begun to fight!” I cried.


We stayed together in the undergrowth, unaware of time passing,
listening to the sound of cannon and pistol fire. Eventually I decided I
should make my way toward the anchorage. Ben agreed to accompany me.
At some point along the way, we spotted a **Union Jack** fluttering above
the trees.


“That must be your friends,” said Ben Gunn.


“It can’t be,” I said, stunned by the sight of the flag. “They’re on the
ship. That must be Silver, or some of the other mutineers.”


**49**


**Evaluative.** Do you think Ben Gunn is a trustworthy character? Why or why not?


» Answers may vary, but students should support their opinions with evidence from

the text. Students may say Ben Gunn is not a trustworthy character because he

is a pirate and, so far in the text, it has become apparent that pirates are often

disloyal and not trustworthy. Alternatively, students may say Ben Gunn is a

trustworthy character because, after being marooned on an island, he has vowed

to change his ways, stop being a pirate, and live a more honest life.

Support


What is the Union Jack?

» The Union Jack is the
official flag of Great Britain.


Support


What is the Jolly Roger?

» The Jolly Roger is the
unofficial flag of pirates,

featuring a skull and
crossbones on a
black background.




- Have students record the answer(s) to question 3 on Activity Page 8.2.


**Inferential.** When Jim Hawkins and Ben Gunn see the Union Jack, why do you think
Ben Gunn says, “That must be your friends”?


» Jim Hawkins and his fellow shipmates are British. Because the Union Jack is the

British flag, it makes sense that Englishmen would fly it, because England is part

of Great Britain. Pirates do not often fly the flags of their homelands; they often fly

the Jolly Roger.



Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**170**


“Not likely,” said Ben Gunn. “In a place like this, where nobody
puts in but gentlemen of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly Roger. You
see, Jim, just over that hill is an old **stockade** . Flint built it many years
ago. I reckon that your friends have retreated to the stockade, and Silver
has the ship.”


“Well,” I said, “if it really is them, I should try to help.”


“I’ll not go with you,” said Ben Gunn, “not till I have an
opportunity to meet with the squire in private. If he wants to talk, tell
him where he can find me and to come with a white flag to show he
means well.”


At that moment, a cannonball came whizzing through the trees
and tore up the sand, not a hundred yards from us. I ran one way and
Ben Gunn ran another.


After parting with Ben Gunn, I decided to assess the situation.
First, I went to check on the _Hispaniola_ . I saw she was still anchored in
the same place, but now she was flying the Jolly Roger. It seemed that
the pirates had indeed taken over the ship. Next, I **scouted** the shore
line. I spotted a big white rock and I figured it must be the rock beneath
which Ben Gunn hid his boat. Then I made my way through the woods
until I came to the stockade, a plain log house surrounded by a tall fence.
I saw that Ben Gunn had been right. My friends were in the stockade
with the Union Jack flying above them. I called out to them and was
warmly welcomed. They told me their story, and I told them mine.


When fighting broke out on the ship, they had decided they would
be safer on the island, so they escaped in two of the landing boats with
some guns and supplies. They had heard about the stockade. When the
pirates saw them rowing away, they fired on them from the ship and
then attacked the stockade. Old Redruth had been killed, and another
of our loyal men, Gray, had been injured.

Lesson 8 The Man on the Island
**171**


**Evaluative.** Based on what you have read, would you characterize buccaneers or
pirates as trustworthy or not trustworthy? Why?


» Answers may vary, but students should support their position with evidence from

the text. For example, buccaneers are not trustworthy people, as they lie, steal,

and treat one another poorly. Marooning Ben Gunn on an island is an example of

how buccaneers can be disloyal and not trustworthy. Ben Gunn wanting to take

Captain Flint’s treasure is also an example of being disloyal, as that treasure does

not belong to him.

~~**CHAPTER DISCUSSION (10 MIN.)**~~


- Bring the class back together as a group and use the following question to
discuss the chapter:


**Inferential.** What significant events occur during this chapter?


» Answers may vary, but should include: Jim Hawkins meets Ben Gunn, a pirate

who has been marooned on Treasure Island for three years; a mutiny takes place,

leaving John Silver and his crew of pirates in charge of the _Hispaniola_ and Jim

Hawkins and his friends taking shelter in a stockade on the island.


- Have students turn to Activity Page 1.3 and refer to the displayed
Character Chart.


- Remind students that this chart is being used throughout the unit to
record key details and information revealed in each chapter about
significant characters.


- Explain that students will record information about Ben Gunn, a character
introduced in Chapter 5.


- Use the information in the chart below to engage students in a discussion

about the character introduced in the chapter. Tell students to draw
on specific details in their responses, such as words, descriptions of
appearances, or actions in the text.

**Lesson 8: The Man on the Island**
Writing 45m


**Primary Focus:** Students will write an introduction to an adventure story using

descriptive details. ~~**TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.11.B.ii; TEKS 4.12.A**~~


~~**DISCUSS A MODEL INTRODUCTION (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Direct students’ attention to the _Treasure Island_ excerpt you prepared in
advance. Explain that this excerpt is the first paragraph of the story and,
therefore, serves as the introduction.


Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, and the other gentlemen have asked me to
record the story of Treasure Island, keeping nothing back but the bearings
because there is still treasure there. Therefore, I take up my pen and go
back to the time when my family ran the Admiral Benbow Inn, and the old
seaman with the sabre cut on his cheek came to stay with us.


 - Have students explain the purpose of an introduction. (to introduce the main
characters, describe the setting, and capture the reader’s attention)


 - Have one student read the excerpt aloud.


 - Have students identify the characters introduced in the excerpt. (Squire
Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, the old seaman with the sabre cut on his cheek, and
the narrator)


 - Point out that the introduction also names the setting, the Admiral Benbow
Inn. A fuller description follows throughout the chapter.


 - Explain that a hook is the information an author provides to capture the
reader’s attention. A hook can be particular information, a specific idea, or
particular images.


 - Have students explain how the reader’s attention is captured in the excerpt.
(The name “Treasure Island” is mentioned, which evokes mystery, wealth, and
adventure. The first-person narrator also implies he has an interesting tale to
tell because others have been urging him to do so. The last sentence ends with
a mysterious, scar-faced character—the reader wants to learn more.)


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.11.B.ii** Develop drafts into a focused, structured, and
coherent piece of writing by developing an engaging idea with relevant details; **TEKS 4.12.A** Compose literary texts such as
personal narratives and poetry using genre characteristics and craft.

~~**PLAN AN INTRODUCTION (15 MIN.)**~~


- Tell students they will plan and draft the introductions to their own
Adventure Stories.


- Refer to the displayed Adventure Story Rubric and have students turn to
Activity Page 8.4. Tell students they will use the Adventure Story Rubric to plan
their introductions.


- Have a student read the “Exemplary” column in the “Introduction” row aloud.


- Tell students the descriptions for each writing element in the “Exemplary”
column will help them plan their introductions. Have students refer to the
rubric, and tell them they should focus on three things:


 - Are the characters portrayed clearly?


 - Is the setting described effectively?


 - Does the introduction have a hook?


- Have students refer to the displayed Writing Prompt and Activity Page 7.2.
Students may also refer to Activity Page 3.2 and their completed character
sketches. Note that they should use the work they’ve produced on character
and setting to help them plan their introductions.


- Tell students to write down their ideas for the introduction in their writing
journals. They do not have to write complete sentences yet; instead, they can
jot down important phrases, names, and details to use in the introduction.


~~**DRAFT AN INTRODUCTION (25 MIN.)**~~


- Have students draft their introductions.


- Students are expected to write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.


- Explain that they should use complete sentences and include figurative
language whenever possible. As needed, students can continue referring
to the displayed Writing Prompt, Activity Pages 3.2, 7.2, and 8.4, and their
completed character paragraphs.


- Explain that their introductions will vary in length, but that they should write

at least five sentences. Some students may need more than one paragraph to
introduce their story.


- Guide students to focus on one element of the introduction at a time. For
example, have students focus on starting the introduction with a description
of the setting. Then students can lead into describing the character(s) in
that setting.

Check for Understanding


Check in with students. Provide reinforcing or corrective feedback:

        - I like the way you’ve described the setting for your story. Can you add

another detail after the second sentence?


        - It looks like you have identified two interesting characters for your story.

How could you use sensory details to help the reader imagine what the
characters smell, hear, or see?


**Lesson Wrap-Up**

- Have students share a favorite sentence from their introductions.


- If students do not finish writing the introduction, they should complete it
for homework.


- Tell students they will reference Activity Page 8.4 in Lessons 12 and 13.


Guidance for Teacher Use of Rubrics


- Rubrics are provided for evaluation of the content and structure of student
writing composed within each unit. Consider the following sample rubric with
bolding. The rubric communicates that a corresponding piece of writing was
evaluated as:


 - Strong for the “Introduction” section


 - Developing for the “Body” section


 - Strong for the “Conclusion” section


 - Between Strong and Exemplary for the “Language” section

cap’n, after your **desertion**, sir. We’re willing to submit, if we can come
to terms, and no bones about it.”


Captain Smollett agreed to meet with Silver—and only Silver. Silver
threw his crutch over the fence, got a leg up, and, with great vigor and
skill, climbed over the fence and dropped to the other side.


“Well, now,” he said, “that was a good scare you gave us last night.
We lost some men, but you mark me, cap’n, it won’t work twice!” said
Silver. “We want that treasure and we’ll have it! You would just as soon
save your lives, I reckon. We want the map, so if you hand it over, we
won’t do you no harm.”


“Not a chance,” replied the captain.


“Give us the map,” said Silver, “and stop shooting poor seamen. If
you do that, we’ll give you a choice. You can come aboard with us once
the treasure is stowed away, and I’ll give you my word of honor to put
you ashore somewhere safe. Or, if that ain’t to your fancy, you can stay
here. We’ll divide the supplies with you, and I’ll send the first ship I
sight to pick you up.”


“Is that all?” Captain Smollett asked. “Now hear me! If you come
up one by one, unarmed, I’ll clap you all in irons and take you home to
a fair trial in England. If not, it won’t end well for you.”


Silver looked scornfully at the captain.


“Give me a hand up!” he cried.


“Not I,” returned Captain Smollett.


“Who’ll give me a hand up?” Silver roared.


Not one among us moved. Silver had to crawl along the sand,

**Evaluative.** John Silver says he’ll give Captain Smollett his “word of honor.” Do you
think Captain Smollett should trust Silver? Why or why not?


» Answers may vary, but students should support their opinion with evidence

from the text. Some students may say Captain Smollett should not trust John

Silver because his prior actions have proven he is a disloyal and dishonest man.

Alternatively, some students may say that perhaps John Silver has changed his

ways and means what he says.

grumbling, till he got close to the door and could hoist himself up on
his crutch. Then he spat into the spring.


“Before an hour’s out, I’ll knock in your old log house. Them that
die will be the lucky ones!” he cried.


As soon as Silver left the stockade, we returned to our posts and
loaded our muskets. There were several small holes in the walls of
the log house. We peered out through the holes and waited for the
**onslaught** .


“Put out the fire!” shouted the captain. “We mustn’t have smoke in
our eyes.”


Suddenly, with a loud cry, a group of pirates leaped from the
woods on the north side and ran straight toward the stockade. At the
same time, gunfire opened from the woods. A rifle ball sang through
the doorway and knocked the doctor’s musket to bits.


The pirates climbed over the fence like monkeys. We fired at them,
and immediately three of them fell to the ground. Four others made it
over the fence and charged forward. In an instant, they were upon us.


“At ’em, all hands!” one of the pirates roared in a voice of thunder.
One pirate grasped Hunter’s musket and wrenched it out of his hands.
With one stunning blow, he laid poor Hunter senseless on the floor.
Meanwhile, another pirate appeared in the doorway and descended
upon the doctor with his **cutlass** .


The log house was filled with smoke, cries, and confusion. Flashes
and the reports of pistol shots rang out.


“Out, lads, and fight ’em in the open!” cried Captain Smollett.


**55**


 - Read the rest of page 55 aloud.


**Inferential.** Why does the fight between Captain Smollett’s men and John Silver’s
men break out? What is the purpose?


» The fight takes place because Silver and Smollett could not come to an

agreement in their discussion. Because Smollett does not give in to Silver’s offers,

Silver and his men attack the stockade. Smollett and his men are forced to defend

themselves. The purpose of the fight is to determine who will continue on the

journey to claim the treasure.


Lesson 9 The Plan
**187**


I snatched a cutlass and dashed out into the sunlight.


“’Round the house, lads! ’Round the house!” the captain cried.


I raised my cutlass and ran ’round the corner of the house. The next
moment I found myself face to face with the pirate named Job Anderson.

He roared and raised his cutlass. I leaped to one side and rolled headlong
down the slope.


Gray followed close behind me and took down Anderson before he
had time to recover. Another pirate was shot while firing into the house.
The doctor had taken down a third. Of the pirates who had made it over

the fence, only one remained, and he had seen enough. He dropped his
cutlass and clambered back over the fence. In three seconds, nothing
remained of the attacking party but the ones who had fallen.


I ran full speed back to the house. Somewhat cleared of smoke,
I assessed the price we had paid for the victory. Hunter lay on the
ground, stunned. Joyce had been killed. In the center, the squire was
holding up the captain, one as pale as the other.


“The captain’s wounded,” said Mr. Trelawney.


“Have they run?” asked Captain Smollett.


“All that could,” returned the doctor. “But there are some that will
never run again.”


“That’s good!” cried the captain. “That means fewer men. That’s
better odds than when we started.”


The mutineers did not return. They had had enough, so we were
able to tend to our wounded and get some food. After dinner, the
doctor grabbed his hat, pistols, and a cutlass. He slipped the map in his
pocket, and with a musket over his shoulder, climbed the fence, setting
off briskly through the trees.


“Is he mad?” Gray asked me.


“I would not have thought him capable of such a thing,” I said.
“I bet he’s going to see Ben Gunn.”


I was right, as I found out later. In the meantime, I had another
thought. The house was stifling. I began to envy the doctor, walking
in the cool shadows of the woods. I longed to escape and set about
gathering supplies for my own **excursion** . I filled both coat pockets
with biscuits, then took two pistols to arm myself.

**Inferential.** Why do you think Jim leaves the safety of the stockade and goes out on
his own?


» Jim describes the stockade as stifling and wants to escape. The doctor goes out on

his own, which gives Jim the idea to do the same. He decides to try to locate Ben

Gunn’s boat. What he plans to do once he locates Ben Gunn’s boat is not entirely

clear, but it seems as though he might try to get to the _Hispaniola_ because he

checks to see where the ship is located in relation to his spot on Treasure Island.


Lesson 9 The Plan
**191**


I thought the mutineers might be planning to raise anchor and sail
away. I wondered how I might be able to prevent this. I could paddle
out in Ben Gunn’s boat under cover of night, cut the ship loose, and let
her drift toward the shore.


I waited for darkness to fall. As the last rays of daylight disappeared,
absolute darkness settled over Treasure Island, and I shoved Ben Gunn’s
boat out of the hollow.


The little coracle was a safe boat for someone my size, but she was
the most difficult **craft** to manage. Turning round and round was the
maneuver at which she was best. She turned in every direction but
the one I chose. However, by good fortune, the tide swept me down to
where the _Hispaniola_ was anchored.


As I drew near, I could hear loud voices in the cabin. One I
recognized as Israel Hands, who was having a disagreement with
another pirate. Both men were angry and oaths flew like hailstones.


I quietly rowed next to the schooner, then carefully cut the ropes
that held the ship in place. The _Hispaniola_ drifted free in the current.
To my surprise, the coracle suddenly lurched. She seemed to change
course and her speed had strangely increased. I realized that I was
being whirled along by the wake of the _Hispaniola_ .


The current turned at right angles, sweeping the tall schooner
and the little coracle out to sea. Not knowing what to do, I lay on the
bottom of my boat, sure this would be my final day. I must have lain
there motionless for some time, but then, even in the midst of my fear,
weariness overcame me and I fell asleep.


When I awoke, it was broad daylight. I found myself tossing about
in the boat at the southwestern end of Treasure Island. I was barely a
quarter of a mile from the shore, and my first thought was to paddle in.


**60**


**Literal.** When Jim reaches the _Hispaniola_, what does he find?


» Jim finds two pirates in what appears to be the aftermath of a fight. Jim is not

even sure the pirates are alive until Israel Hands opens his eyes and asks Jim

for help.


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**192**


I soon saw the problem with this idea. The coast was rocky, and
powerful waves crashed against the rocks. If I tried to land, I might be
dashed to death upon the rough shore.


I attempted to paddle to a safer landing spot along the cape, but
there was no use. Try as I might, the current carried the coracle past the
point of the cape. There, I beheld a sight that changed the nature of my
thoughts. It was the _Hispaniola_ . I knew there were at least a few pirates
on board, but I could not see any of them. To and fro, up and down, the
ship sailed by swoops and dashes, as if nobody was steering. I thought
maybe the pirates had deserted the ship, or maybe they were sleeping. I
figured if I could get onboard, I could return the ship to the captain.


I set myself to paddle and did so till I drew up alongside the ship,
and the bowsprit was just over my head. I sprang to my feet, and leaped
up, pushing the coracle under water. Then, with one hand, I caught the
jibboom and pulled myself up onto the deck of the _Hispaniola_ .


At first I did not see a soul. However, on the afterdeck I discovered
the two men who had been left to watch the ship. One was on his back,
lifeless. A little further on sat Israel Hands, propped against the ship
wall, with his chin on his chest. His hands lay open, and his face was as
white as a candle.


I saw the signs of a fight and felt sure the two men had killed each
other. Just then, Israel Hands gave a low moan. He opened his eyes
wearily and caught sight of me. He said only two words, “Help me!”

~~**CHAPTER DISCUSSION (10 MIN.)**~~


- Use the following questions to discuss the chapter:


**Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share._ Why do you think this chapter is titled “The Plan”?


» Answers may vary, but should be supported with evidence from the text. The

chapter may be called “The Plan” because most of the main characters have

some sort of plan they attempt to put into motion over the course of this chapter.

The following events take place during this chapter: John Silver reveals his plan

of finding and claiming the treasure for himself and then leaving the island—with

or without Captain Smollett and his men; Captain Smollett tells of his own plan to

capture John Silver and the pirates and take them to England for a trial; the doctor

appears to have a plan, even though it is still unclear by the end of the chapter;

most importantly, Jim Hawkins has a plan to bring the _Hispaniola_ to the shore of

Treasure Island so Captain Smollett can regain control of the ship.


**Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share._ At the end of this chapter, who do you think has
the upper hand, or has more power and control—Captain Smollett’s men or John
Silver’s men? Support your opinion with evidence from the text.


» Answers may vary, but should be supported with evidence from the text. Students

may say Captain Smollett’s men have the upper hand because they are victorious

in the battle, are safe in the stockade, and are in possession of the map to the

buried treasure, whereas most of John Silver’s men are now dead or wounded.

Alternatively, students may say John Silver’s men have the upper hand because

they are still in control of the _Hispaniola_ and could, therefore, sail off to safety,

while Captain Smollett’s men are stuck on the island.

                - Although any of the above student-error scenarios may occur, misspellings

may be due to many other factors. You may find it helpful to use the analysis
chart to record any student errors. For example:


                       - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


                       - Is the student consistently making errors at the ends of the words?


                       - Is the student consistently making errors in multisyllable words, but not

single-syllable words?


                 - Also, examine the dictated sentence for errors in capitalization
and punctuation.

~~**INTRODUCE THE CHAPTER (5 MIN.)**~~


- Tell students they will read Chapter 7, “‘Shiver Me Timbers.’”


- Explain that the title is an idiom that would be difficult to understand without
some background. “Shiver me timbers” is a catchphrase often attributed to
pirates in literature. It is used to express shock, surprise, or annoyance. The
phrase comes from nautical slang, and the word _timbers_ refers to the wooden
support frames of a sailing ship. In rough waters, ships would be lifted up
and down by the waves so hard as to “shiver” or shake the timbers, startling
the sailors.


- Have students turn to the table of contents, locate the chapter, and then turn

to the first page of the chapter.


- Tell students they may want to refer to pages 107 and 108 of the Reader, as
well as Activity Pages SR.1 and SR.2, if they have questions about particular
ship references while reading the chapter.


- Preview the core vocabulary words before reading the chapter.


- Begin by telling students the first vocabulary word they will encounter in this
chapter is _lashed_ .


- Have them find the word on page 64 of the Reader. Explain that each
vocabulary word is bolded the first time it appears in the chapter.


- Explain that in this context the word _lashed_ means to have tied something
down with a cord or a rope.


- Remind students that definitions for all bolded vocabulary words can be found
in the Glossary at the back of the Reader.


- Have students reference Activity Page 10.2 while you read each word and
its meaning.


**Vocabulary**


**lash, v.** to tie down with a rope or cord (lashed) (64)


**pretext**, **n.** a pretend reason given to hide one’s true reason for doing

something (64)


**treachery**, **n.** a betrayal; an act of hurting someone who trusts you (64)

**Establish Small Groups**

- Before reading the chapter, divide students into two groups using the
following guidelines:


  - Small Group 1: Students will complete Activity Page 10.3 with your support
while they read.


  - Small Group 2: You may want to ask some or all students to complete
Activity Page 10.3 independently, which can then be used as a formative
assessment to determine how well each student understood what was read.
Make arrangements to check that students in Small Group 2 have answered
the questions on Activity Page 10.3 correctly.

**Literal.** Describe the scene on the _Hispaniola_ when Jim arrives.


» The ship is a mess; every chest has been opened and ransacked as the pirates

searched for the treasure map.


Lesson 10 “Shiver Me Timbers”
**209**


**Evaluative.** Jim seems much surer of himself in this scene than in earlier chapters.
How does he show leadership on the _Hispaniola_ ?


» Answers may vary, but may include that Jim acts fairly but authoritatively with

Israel Hands. He gives him a drink and addresses him politely, as a gentleman or

captain would. However, Jim also speaks confidently, telling Hands he will now

take over the ship and be his captain. Jim takes charge of the situation, making

him seem mature.


                 - Have students record the answer(s) to question 1 on Activity Page 10.3.


**Inferential.** Why does Jim take down the Jolly Roger and shout, “God save
the king!”?


» Answers may vary, but may include that Jim takes down the Jolly Roger to show

that the pirates no longer control the ship. “God save the king!” is a victory cheer

meant to intimidate Hands, assert Jim’s authority, and give Jim courage to

proceed with his plans to secure the ship. It also indicates that the ship is again

sailing under the British Flag.


                 - Have students record the answer(s) to question 2 on Activity Page 10.3.

Lesson 10 “Shiver Me Timbers”
**211**


“Well, Cap’n Hawkins,” he groaned. “I reckon you’ll want to get
ashore, so suppose we talk. This man,” he said, nodding feebly at the
body on the deck, “this man and me got the ship ready to sail back
home. Who’s to sail her now? You’re not a sailor, and I reckon unless I
give you a hint, you ain’t the man for the job. Now, look here, we need
to join forces. Get me a scarf and help me tie up this wound, and then
I’ll tell you how to sail her.”


I agreed to work with him, at least for the time being. I **lashed** the
wheel in place and went below to get a handkerchief. I returned to the
deck and helped Hands bind up the wound in his thigh. After another
gulp or two of water, he sat up straighter, spoke clearer, and looked in
every way a revived man.


“Cap’n,” he said, after a while. “I’d take it kindly if you’d get me
something to eat. I need some sustenance if we are to manage this ship.”
I guessed that this was just a **pretext**, as his face contained the look of
**treachery** . He wanted to get me off the deck for some reason, though I
wasn’t sure why. However, I cleverly masked my suspicions.


“All right,” I answered. “I’ll bring you up some food, but I may have
to dig around a bit to find something worth eating.”


I went below, slipped off my shoes, and ran quietly along the
gallery deck until I got to the forecastle ladder. I climbed up toward the
deck and popped my head out, as I knew Hands would not expect to
see me there.


He had risen to his hands and knees, and, though his leg was
obviously injured, he was pulling himself across the deck at a good clip.
At length, he grabbed a dagger, which he concealed inside his jacket,
and then hurried back into his old place against the wall of the ship.


This told me all I needed to know. Hands was mobile, he was

                - Have students preview question 3 on Activity age 10.3 and then read pages 64

and 65 silently.


**Inferential.** Why does Jim agree to help Israel Hands by binding his wound and
getting him food?


» Jim doesn’t know how to sail a ship, so he needs Hands’s help to get to shore.


**Inferential.** How does Jim know that Hands will turn against him?


» Jim says Hands has a “look of treachery,” meaning he can see the deceit in

Hands’s expression. Jim cleverly peeks out onto the deck without Hands knowing

and watches as the pirate grabs a dagger and hides it in his shirt.


                 - Have students record the answer(s) to question 3 on Activity Page 10.3.

armed, and it was clear that I was to be his next victim. Yet I felt sure
Hands would not attack me right away. He wanted to get back to
land as much as I did. Therefore, he would wait until the ship was
safely at anchor.


Hands and I worked in **unison** to guide in the ship. The entrance
to the anchorage was narrow. He gave orders, and I obeyed without
giving him the slightest hint that I trusted him as much as I trusted my
worst enemy.


Finally, as we approached the anchorage, I heard something creak
and saw a shadow moving toward me. I looked around, and there was
Hands, coming at me with the dagger in his hand. He roared with
fury, like a charging bull. I leaped sideways, letting go of the wheel and
ducking away from him. The wheel caught him, leaving me just enough
time to reach into my pocket and draw my pistol. I hastily took aim
and pulled the trigger. The hammer fell, but the pistol did not fire—the
gunpowder was wet.


Hands came after me again, and with no time to reload, my only
hope was to retreat. As I fled, the _Hispaniola_ ran aground on a sandbar.
The ship tilted to the port side, till the deck stood at an angle of fortyfive degrees. Hands and I fell and rolled about the deck.


I got up first and sprang into the ropes. Hands struck at me with
his dagger but missed. I began to reload my pistol, and Hands realized
the odds were going against him. He hauled himself up into the rigging
after me with the dagger clenched between his teeth. He was a third of
the way up by the time I readied my pistol.


“One more step, Mr. Hands,” said I, “and I’ll shoot!”


He stopped, and I could see in his eyes that he was considering his
next move.


**65**


**Inferential.** It seems that Hands has an advantage in the fight on deck because he
is a stronger, more experienced fighter, but Jim has luck on his side. How does Jim
gain the advantage in their battle?


» When Jim dodges Hands’s first attack, the wheel catches Hands, giving Jim time

to grab his pistol. Then, the ship runs aground, knocking both of them down. Jim

manages to get up quickly and load his pistol while Hands climbs up the ropes.

» Hands tries to trick Jim into thinking he will surrender, so he can surprise Jim by

throwing the dagger when Jim is least expecting it.

to myself how my friends were taking such a great risk sleeping when
they should be standing watch. What if Silver and the pirates launched

» Long John Silver and his men took over the stockade.


**Inferential.** How does Long John Silver try to convince Jim to join the pirates?


» Silver flatters Jim by telling him he’s always liked him, praising his spirited nature,

and telling him he should get a share of the treasure. Silver argues that Jim has

no choice but to join the pirates because the Captain and doctor have turned

against him.

“Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!”


It was Silver’s parrot, Captain Flint!


I turned to run, but as soon as I did, I collided with another man
who grabbed me and held me tight.


Soon the red glare of a torch lit up the interior of the log house. I
saw Silver’s face. First he squinted at me and then he smiled.


“Well, shiver me timbers!” he said. “It’s Jim Hawkins! Welcome,
lad!”


Even though his greeting was deceptively friendly, Silver had his
men tie me up. I counted that he had five men left, but one of them was
ghostly pale, with a blood-stained bandage ’round his head, so I figured
he would not be able to put up much of a fight.


I could not imagine how these six buccaneers could have driven
my friends out of the stockade.


Silver patted me on the back.


“I knew you were smart, Hawkins,” he said. “You’re a lad of spirit,
too. I’ve always said you should get a share of the treasure yourself. And
now, I’m afraid you’ve got no choice but to side with us. Cap’n Smollett
won’t have you back, and even the doctor has turned against you.
‘Ungrateful scamp.’ That’s what he called you. No, you can’t go back
to your own lot now, for they won’t have you. You’ll have to join with
Cap’n Silver!”


From this exchange, I learned that my friends were still alive. As
for what Silver said about my friends being angry with me, I confess I
partly believed him.

business has gone to wreck, and if you want to know who did it—I’m
the one! I was in the apple barrel the night we sighted land, and I heard
you talking with the others. I heard every word you said—and told my
friends before the hour was out. As for the _Hispaniola_, it was I who cut
her loose, it was I who killed the men you had left aboard, and it was
I who anchored her where you’ll never see her more! Kill me, if you
please, or spare me, but one thing I’ll say, and no more. If you spare me,
bygones are bygones, and when you are in court for piracy, I’ll save you
if I can. You choose. Kill me and do yourself no good, or spare me and
keep a witness to save yourself from the fate of a judge and jury.”


At last I stopped. I was out of breath. Not a man moved. The
pirates sat staring at me.


“Well, well,” said Silver, with a curious accent. “That’s a mighty fine
speech.”


I could not decide if he was laughing at me or if he was impressed
by my apparent courage.


**71**


**Inferential.** Why does Jim tell Silver he sabotaged the pirates’ plans, or caused
them to fail?


» Jim wants to show Silver he is brave and clever in the hopes Silver will spare his
life. Jim is proud that he outwitted the pirates, and he seems to relish the chance
to tell his story.


**Evaluative.** Why does Jim give Silver a choice rather than simply beg for his life?


» Rather than begging for his life, he offers arguments that show his cleverness and
bravery. Jim hopes if he can convince Silver that he is not only brave and smart, but
also more valuable as an ally and witness, Silver will not have the pirates kill him.
Although Jim is probably scared, he doesn’t show it. Instead, he speaks confidently,
showing his wits and courage. Jim says, “You choose,” which is a command. So at his
most vulnerable, dangerous moment, Jim tells Silver what to do. In other words, the
language Jim chooses makes him sound as if he is in control.



Support


Explain that the saying
“bygones are bygones”
means let the past stay in
the past. This means that
Jim will not hold a grudge
and will not allow himself
to be affected by what has
transpired with Silver in
the past.

                 - Have students record the answer(s) to question 6 on Activity Page 10.3.


**Evaluative.** Explain why the chapter is titled “‘Shiver Me Timbers.’” If needed,
remind students that “shiver me timbers” is a catchphrase often attributed to
pirates that is used to express shock, surprise, or annoyance.


» Long John Silver uses the phrase on page 69 to emphasize his surprise at

seeing Jim enter the stockade. The chapter is full of surprises—the battle on the

_Hispaniola_, Jim returning to the stockade to find the pirates there, Jim telling

Silver that he is the one who foiled Silver’s plan—so the chapter title captures the

idea of surprise by referring to that phrase.

~~**INTRODUCE DIALOGUE (30 MIN.)**~~


                  - Tell students you will discuss dialogue and how to insert it in a story.


                - Have students define the term _dialogue_ .


» when two or more characters speak in a story


                - Ask students why dialogue is important to a story. Answers may include:
It helps readers get to know the characters and how they interact with one
another. It also involves the reader in the story and makes events seem
more real. Dialogue transmits important information and shows characters’
feelings. Dialogue shows rather than tells.


                 - Direct students’ attention to the sentence from the Reader you prepared in
advance. Have a student read the sentence aloud.


                       - “No one lays a finger on the boy!” Silver growled.

                 - Have students turn and talk with a peer about what is happening in the story.

(Long John Silver is defending Jim against the other pirates.) Ask students
why _growled_ is a stronger verb choice than _said_ or _stated_ . (The strong verb
lets us imagine what Silver sounded like. _Growled_ implies that he sounded
angry and similar to an animal. The word choice also shows that Silver is a
leader and has influence over the other pirates.) Ask students to brainstorm
other verbs that could be used in place of “growled” that would have a similar
impact. Offer support to those students who struggle to think of alternative
word choices. Encourage students to take note of suggestions from
other classmates.

- Tell students as they write dialogue, they should imagine what the characters
are thinking and feeling.


- Have students reread the example sentence from page 72 in _Treasure Island_ .


- Remind students that quotation marks show exactly what is being said by a
particular character. The quotation marks set off what is being quoted from
the rest of the text.


- Remind students that punctuation for dialogue should be located inside the
quotation marks. For example, the exclamation point at the end of Silver’s
statement is included inside the quotation marks because it relates to
the dialogue.


- Remind students that punctuation not for dialogue should remain outside of
the quotation marks.


- Explain that students should begin a new paragraph each time there is a new
speaker, starting on a new line and indenting.


- Direct students’ attention to the sentences you prepared in advance and have
students read the sentences silently.


  - Mr. Silver sir I asked hesitantly


  - Yes lad said he


- Tell students the sentences are examples of dialogue. Have students
punctuate the sentences correctly, either orally or by appointing a
student scribe.


» “Mr. Silver, sir?” I asked hesitantly.


» ”Yes, lad,” said he.


- Once the punctuation is in place, have students turn to page 25 in the Reader
to see if the sentences are punctuated correctly.


- Tell students that they will be incorporating dialogue into their adventure story
drafts at least twice.


- Have students think about the characters they created in their introduction
and create dialogue for their story in their writing journal for the remainder of
the lesson.

**Reading**

                 - Post the following questions for end-of-chapter discussion:


                       - _Think-Pair-Share._ This chapter is titled, “My Life Hangs in the Balance.” The
expression “hang in the balance” is an idiom. When something hangs in the
balance, it means it is dependent upon something else in order to continue
to exist or thrive. Why do you think this chapter is titled “My Life Hangs in
the Balance”?

~~**REVIEW (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students summarize Chapter 7, “‘Shiver Me Timbers,’” noting how the
chapter ends. As needed, prompt students with questions about Chapter 7,
eventually noting the events listed below.


» Answers may vary, but should include the following: Jim Hawkins takes over the

_Hispaniola_ ; he fights Israel Hands; Jim gets back to the island and returns to

the stockade, only to find that the pirates are there; the pirates tie Jim up; John

Silver tells Jim that he made a bargain with the doctor and that the doctor, the

squire, and the others are still alive but he doesn’t know where they are. Students

should note that the chapter ends with Jim making a speech to the pirates taking

responsibility for the state of things. He says the pirates can kill him or spare

him—but if they kill him, they have nothing, and if they spare him, he will try to

help them when they are in court for piracy.


~~**INTRODUCE THE CHAPTER (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students they will read Chapter 8, “My Life Hangs in the Balance.”

look up, but it was not me they were looking at. It was Silver. Eventually
they went outside, leaving Silver and me alone.


“Now, look here, Hawkins,” Silver said in a whisper that was barely
audible. “You’re within half a plank of death. They’re going to try to
throw me off, but I’ll stand by you through thick and thin. I didn’t mean
to. No, not till you spoke, but now I see what sort of man you are. You
stand by me, and I’ll stand by you. I’ll save your life if I can—but, if I
do, it’s tit for tat, Jim. You’ve got to help me out if I get into a sticky spot
with the squire and your people. You’ve got to do what you can to save
John Silver.”


I was bewildered. It seemed a hopeless thing he was asking. After
all, he had been the **ringleader** from the beginning. I told him I would
do what I could if it should come to that.


“Then, it’s a bargain!” he said, still whispering. “I’m on the squire’s
side from now on, and you and I will stick together.”


We sat in silence for a few moments and then Silver continued,
“While we’re sittin’ here, perhaps you can explain somethin’. Why do
you suppose the doctor decided to give me Flint’s map?” he asked.


My face must have expressed complete astonishment. I could
not imagine why Dr. Livesey would have given Silver the map, and I
wondered if he really had. Silver saw that I was surprised, but he did
not press me for an answer.


“There’s a reason for it, no doubt,” he said, shaking his head like a
man who expects the worst.


Just then the door opened, and one of the mutineers stepped
in. Or, more like it, he was pushed in by the others. He was visibly
trembling.


**73**


**Inferential.** Based on what Silver tells Jim, why is Silver protecting Jim?


» Based on what Silver tells Jim, Silver is protecting Jim because Silver has decided

he is on the squire’s side now. He says that Jim’s speech showed him what sort

of man Jim is and that the speech changed Silver’s mind about what to do. Silver

says that, in turn, he expects Jim to help him later.

                 - Have students preview question 1 parts A and B on Activity Page 11.2 and then
read pages 74 and 75 silently.


**Support.** Why do the pirates give Silver the black spot?


» The pirates give Silver the black spot because they want to mutiny. The pirates no

longer want Silver as their leader. They say Silver has made a mess of their original

plan, he let the other men get away, and he will not let them hurt Jim.


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**232**


You all know what my plan was, and if we had stuck to it, we’d a
been aboard the _Hispaniola_ this night, every man of us alive, and the
treasure stowed safely in the hold. Now you have the **insolence** to stand
for cap’n over me—you, that sank the lot of us!”


Silver paused, and I could see by the other men’s faces that these
words had not been said in vain.


“You say this cruise is ruined,” Silver continued. “By gum, you’re
right about that. We’re close to being locked up, but there’s one thing
that may save us yet and that’s this boy. You **scurvy** dogs want to kill
him? What sort of a fool plan is that? Much better to keep him alive.
Maybe you didn’t know that there’s a rescue boat coming to get these
gentlemen, but there is, and when that boat arrives, you’ll be glad we
have a **hostage** to bargain with.”


Silver spat on the ground and went on, “And as for why I made
a bargain with the squire, well, look here!” As he spoke, he pulled the
map out of his pocket. “Right here’s why I done it!”


I looked and saw that it was the map with the three red crosses, the
one I had found in the captain’s sea chest. Dr. Livesey really had given it
to Silver! But why? I could not imagine.


The other mutineers were stunned, too. They leaped on the map
like ravenous beasts. It was passed from hand to hand, one tearing it
from another, and by the oaths and the cries and the childish laughter
with which they accompanied their examination, you would have
thought they were fingering the gold itself, already loaded safely on
the ship.


“Yes,” said one, “it’s Flint’s writing, sure enough!”


“Then there’s hope in it yet!” exclaimed another.


**75**


**Inferential.** What is the reason Silver gives the other pirates for why he is
protecting Jim?


» Silver tells the pirates he is protecting Jim because they’ll need to use him as a

hostage in order to bargain with the other men later.



Challenge


The text says the men
“leaped on the map like
ravenous beasts.” What
does this simile suggest
about the men’s feelings in
this moment?


Support


What is the black spot?


» The black spot is the sign
for mutiny.



Lesson 11 My Life Hangs in the Balance
**233**


Support


Remind students that a
hostage is someone who
is taken and held against
their own will by another
person or a group of
people. A hostage can
be used to bargain with
because the people who
have the hostage can
ask for money, goods,
or other rewards in
exchange for returning the
hostage safely.

~~**ELPS 3.G; ELPS 4.J**~~



**Inferential.** How is the explanation that Silver gives the pirates for why he is
protecting Jim different from the one he gives Jim?


» Answers may vary, but may include that Silver tells Jim he is on his side, yet he

tells the pirates he is on their side. Silver tells Jim that he is on the squire’s side

and is protecting him because they are on the same side. Silver tells the pirates

that he is on their side and protecting Jim as a way to bargain with the others later.


- Have students record the answer(s) to Part A of question 1 on Activity
Page 11.2.


**Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share._ Of the two reasons Silver gives for protecting Jim,
which do you think is more likely to be true? Support your answer with evidence
from the text.


» Answers may vary, but should include evidence from the text as support. Some

students may say that the reason he gives Jim is true because he wants to

side with the squire and his men, thinking that is the best option for getting off

the island. Other students may say that the reason he gives the pirates is true

because, despite what he tells Jim, his allegiance is to his pirate crew and he

knows he will need to bargain with the other men. Alternatively, students may say

that Silver has proven himself as not trustworthy and could be tricking both Jim

and the pirates for his own personal gain.

**234**


 - Have students preview question 2 on Activity Page 11.2 and then read pages
76 and 77 aloud.


**Inferential.** Why do the pirates decide not to go forward with their mutiny?


» The pirates decide not to mutiny when Silver produces the treasure map. They

decide they still have an opportunity to retrieve the treasure if they continue on

with Silver as their leader, so they decide not to mutiny.


 - Have students record the answer(s) to question 2 on Activity Page 11.2.

**236**


 - Have students preview questions 3 and 4 on Activity Page 11.2 and then read
pages 78 and 79 silently.


**Inferential.** Casual language and slang are often used to portray character.
As mentioned in earlier chapters, some of the dialogue in _Treasure Island_ uses
shortened forms of words and even non-standard grammar to imitate the speech
and rhythm of the pirates speaking to each other. Rephrase the following sentences
using standard English: “Aye,” said Silver. “You wouldn’t find a Bishop here, I reckon,
but what sort of a way is that for bones to lie? It ain’t in nature.”


» Answers may vary but should sound something like, “Yes,” said Silver. “You

wouldn’t find a Bishop here, I bet, but look at those bones. You will not find bones

positioned that way naturally.”


Lesson 11 My Life Hangs in the Balance
**237**


“Aye,” said Silver. “You wouldn’t find a bishop here, I reckon, but
what sort of a way is that for bones to lie? It ain’t in nature.”


The dead man lay perfectly straight, with both arms raised above
his head like a diver. We stood and stared at the skeleton for a minute
before Silver broke the silence.


“I’ve taken a notion into my old skull,” he said. “I think this poor
fellow is a pointer. Get out the compass and take a bearing—along the
line the bones is pointin’.”


It was done and, sure enough, the bones seemed to be pointing the
way to the treasure.


“I thought so!” cried Silver. “This is one of Flint’s little jokes. Him
and those six fellows was alone here. He killed ’em, every man, and this
one he laid down by compass to point the way!”


After a few minutes, we set off again, but the pirates no longer
ran. They kept side by side and spoke softly. The terror of the fallen
buccaneer had dampened their spirits.


When we reached the top of the hill and saw the Spyglass before
us, Silver took bearings with his compass.


“There are three tall trees,” he said, “and they are in the right line.
Should be child’s play to find the loot now!”

                 - Have students record the answer(s) to question 3 on Activity Page 11.2.

» It points in the direction of the buried treasure.


                 - Have students record the answer(s) to question 4 on Activity Page 11.2. As
needed, discuss the events in the chapter and encourage students to turn

~~**CHAPTER DISCUSSION (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Bring the class back together as a group and use the following question to
discuss the chapter.


1. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share._ This chapter is titled, “My Life Hangs in the

Balance.” The expression “hang in the balance” is an idiom. When something

hangs in the balance, it means it is dependent upon something else in order

to continue to exist or thrive. Why do you think this chapter is titled “My Life

Hangs in the Balance”?


» Jim is the narrator, so “my life” means Jim’s life. His life hangs in the balance

because whether he lives or dies is currently dependent on Silver. Silver agrees

to save Jim’s life in exchange for his support in talking to the squire. The chapter

refers to the fact that Jim’s life depends on things working out according to

Silver’s plan—and on finding the treasure.


~~**WORD WORK: EXPRESS (5 MIN.)**~~


1. In the chapter you read, “My face must have expressed complete

astonishment.”


2. Say the word _express_ with me.


3. _Express_ means to represent or convey a feeling or opinion in words

or actions.


4. After my sister flawlessly performed her piano solo at the recital, she

expressed complete joy and had a huge smile on her face for the rest of the

day.


5. What are some other examples of feelings or opinions people express? Be

sure to use the word _express_ in your response.


 - Ask two or three students to use the target word in a sentence. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to make complete sentences:
“ expressed when .”


6. What part of speech is the word _express?_

**Primary Focus:** Students will correctly use coordinating conjunctions in sentences

with appropriate punctuation. ~~**[ TEKS 4.11.D.viii, TEKS 4.11.D.x]**~~


 - Tell students that today they will learn about coordinating conjunctions.


 - Remind students that conjunctions connect words or groups of words. Explain
that conjunctions often connect words to words, phrases to phrases, and
clauses to clauses.


 - Tell students that there are three types of conjunctions, but they will only
focus on one type: coordinating conjunctions.


 - Refer to the Coordinating Conjunctions Poster you prepared in advance. Tell
students that coordinating conjunctions are words that join together words,
phrases, or clauses of equal importance. Coordinating conjunctions include
_and, but, so_, and _yet_ .


 - Refer to the example sentences you prepared in advance that include _and_ .
Have different students read them aloud.

   - I like cake and pie.

   - She loves cats, and I love dogs.


 - Point out that in one of the examples, there is no comma in the sentence. Point
out that in the other example, there is a comma in the sentence.


 - Explain that in the case of compound sentences, a comma must be added to
the sentence before the conjunction. Explain that a compound sentence is one
with more than one independent clause.


 - Explain that an independent clause is a clause, or part of a sentence, that has
a subject and a predicate. This means that each clause could stand alone as a
separate sentence.


**TEKS 4.11.D** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including (viii) coordinating conjunctions to form compound
subjects, predicates, and sentences; (x) punctuation marks including apostrophes in possessives, commas in compound
sentences, and quotation marks in dialogue.



Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**240**


- Refer to the first example sentence. Have students identify the subject(s)
in the sentence _(I)_ . Then have students identify the predicate(s) ( _like cake_
_and pie_ ). Explain that, because there is only one subject and predicate in this
sentence, the sentence does not have two independent clauses. Therefore, a
comma is not needed.


- Refer to the second example sentence. Have students identify the subject(s) in
the sentence ( _she_ and _I_ ). Then have students identify the predicate(s) ( _loves cats_
and _love dogs_ ). Explain that, because there are two subjects and two predicates
in this sentence, the sentence has two independent clauses. Rewrite the parts as
individual sentences on the board/chart paper to illustrate this point. (“She loves
cats. I love dogs.”) Because this sentence contains two independent clauses, a
comma is needed before the conjunction _and_ .


- Refer to the example sentences you prepared in advance that include _but_ .
Have different students read them aloud.


  - She wanted to go to the park but couldn’t go.


  - We wanted pineapple, but we got watermelon instead.


- Point out that in one of the examples, there is no comma in the sentence. Point
out that in the other example, there is a comma in the sentence.


- Refer to the first example sentence. Explain that this sentence does not have
two independent clauses, so no comma is needed.


- Refer to the second example sentence. Explain that this sentence does have
two independent clauses, so a comma is needed before the conjunction but.


- Refer to the example sentences you prepared in advance that include _so_ . Have
different students read them aloud.


  - Christopher was sick, so he stayed home from school.


  - Olivia needed to buy sugar, so she went to the market.

~~**MORPHOLOGY: SUFFIXES –FUL AND –LESS (15 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students will distinguish between root words and words with
the suffix – _ful_ or – _less_ and use those words correctly in sentences.

~~**TEKS 4.2.A.v; TEKS 4.3.C**~~


 - Tell students today they will learn about the suffixes – _ful_ and – _less_ .


 - Write the suffixes – _ful_ and – _less_ on the Suffixes Poster on display in the
classroom. Point out that – _ful_ is pronounced /f ә l/. Point out that – _less_ is
pronounced /les/.


Check for Understanding


Ask students if they know what the suffix – _ful_ means. (“full of”) Ask
students to signal their agreement with a classmate’s answer with a
thumbs-up/thumbs-down. Clarify meaning of the suffix – _ful_ as needed.
Write the meaning of the suffix on the poster. Ask students if they know
what the suffix – _less_ means. (“without” or “lacking”) Ask students to
signal their agreement with a classmate’s answer with a thumbs-up/
thumbs-down. Clarify meaning of the suffix – _less_ as needed. Write the
meaning of the suffix on the poster.


**TEKS 4.2.A.v** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words using knowledge of suffixes, including how
they can change base words such as dropping e, changing y to i, and doubling final consonants; **TEKS 4.3.C** Determine the
meaning of and use words with affixes such as mis-, sub-, -ment, and -ity/ty and roots such as auto, graph, and meter.



Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**242**


 - Explain that when you add the suffix – _ful_ or – _less_ to a noun, the new word is
an adjective.


 - Write “power” on the board/chart paper. Briefly discuss the meaning of the
word and then use it in a sentence. ( _Power_ means “strength, influence, or
authority.” My parents have the power to make the rules in our house.)


 - Add the suffix – _ful_ to power and have students read the new word; then
discuss the meaning of the new word and use it in a sentence. ( _Powerful_
means “full of strength, influence, or authority.” Our principal is a powerful
person in our school.)


 - Think-Pair-Share. Have students provide sentences using the word powerful.
(Answers may vary.)


 - Erase or cover – _ful_ and add the suffix – _less_ to power and have students
read the new word; then discuss the meaning of the new word and use it in a
sentence. ( _Powerless_ means “without strength, influence, or authority.” The
people were powerless to stop the storm, so they just had to prepare for its
arrival as best they could.)


 - Remind students that some words change the spelling when adding a suffix.
Point out that the _–y_ (pronounced /i/) changes to _–i_ (pronounced /I/) when
adding _–ful_ to the word _beauty_ .


**Note:** Adding the suffixes – _ful_ and – _less_ to the same root word creates

words with opposite meanings. _Powerful_ and _powerless_ are _antonyms_, or

words with opposite meanings.


Check for Understanding


On an index card or a sticky note, have students provide sentences using
the word _powerless_ . (Answers may vary.) Convene a small group for
review/re-teach as needed.


 - Continue in this manner for the remaining words, using the following chart as
a guide.


**Note:** You will not write the information in the shaded columns on the board/

chart paper, as that information is intended for use during oral instruction.

Complete as many examples as time permits.

Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**244**


~~**SPELLING: INTRODUCE SPELLING WORDS (15 MIN.)**~~


**Primary Focus:** Students will apply grade-level phonics and word analysis

skills to decode and encode targeted words.

~~**TEKS 4.2.A.i; TEKS 4.2.A.ii; TEKS 4.2.B.iii ; TEKS 4.2.B.vi**~~


- Explain that students will practice 12 words related to suffixes they have studied

in morphology. Apart from the suffixes, these words do not follow one single

spelling pattern. Tell students they will be assessed on these words and will write

a dictated sentence related to one or more of these words in Lesson 15.


- Introduce the words by writing them on the board/chart paper. First say the

word aloud, and then sound out each syllable, naming each letter aloud as

you write it. Continue syllable by syllable until the word is spelled correctly.

You may wish to use the pronunciation chart to guide students in saying the

words.

**Note:** Remember to point out specific spelling patterns in each word and

their relationship to the sounds and spellings on the Individual Code Chart.



9. powerful


10. helpless


11. senseless


12. endless



1. enjoyable


2. predictable


3. comfortable


4. accessible



5. visible


6. edible


7. faithful


8. successful



**Pronunciation/Syllabication Chart**


 - As you introduce and write each word, it may be helpful if you point out particular

spelling patterns within each word and show students where these spellings

are reflected on the Individual Code Chart. For example, you might note that the

word _faithful_ includes a schwa sound (/ ә /) in the second syllable of the word

(i.e., the second syllable is pronounced /f ә l/, but spelled ‘ful’) and then point out

the ‘ul’ spelling for / ә l/ that is included on the Individual Code Chart.

|Word|CK Code|Syllable Type|
|---|---|---|
|enjoyable|/en*joi*ə*bəl/|closed*digraph*ə*ə|
|predictable|/pree*dik*tə*bəl/|open*closed*ə*ə|
|comfortable|/kəm*fer*tə*bəl/|ə*r-controlled*ə*ə|
|accessible|/ak*ses*ə*bəl/|closed*closed*ə*ə|



**TEKS 4.2.A.** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by (i) decoding words with specific orthographic patterns and rules,
including regular and irregular plurals; (ii) decoding multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe syllables;
vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables; **TEKS 4.2.B** Demonstrate
and apply spelling knowledge by (iii) spelling multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns; (vi) spelling words
using knowledge of suffixes, including how they can change base words such as dropping e, changing y to i, and doubling
final consonants.

 - Remind students they can look up a word in the glossary if they forget its meaning.


~~**RE-READING CHAPTER 8 (25 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** At this point in the school year, some or all of your students are

likely ready for the challenge of reading the entire chapter independently

to themselves, especially since this lesson is a reread of the chapter the

class read as a whole group in the previous lesson. We encourage you

to differentiate, assigning students to read either independently or with

partners, based on their needs.


 - Pair students to read and discuss the chapter. Alternatively, some or all
students may read independently.


 - Have students complete Activity Page 12.1 with their partners while they read.
Likewise, you may want to ask some or all students to independently complete
Activity Page 12.1, which can then be used as a formative assessment to
determine how well each student understood what was read.


~~**CHAPTER DISCUSSION (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Review the correct answers to Activity Page 12.1 with the whole class. You
may wish to select different students to read each question and share their
responses, including the page number where the evidence for the answer
was located


Check for Understanding


Ask students to give a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down to signal their
agreement or disagreement with each answer shared aloud. Depending
upon the responses from students, you may wish to review figurative
language with the whole class or with a small group of students.


1. **Inferential.** In the second paragraph on page 72, how does the use of the phrase

“to feed the fishes” contribute to the meaning of the passage in which it is used?


» C. The phrase suggests that if the men don’t obey Silver, he will throw them in the

ocean, where they will become food for the fish.


2. **Inferential.** The idiom “tit for tat” means something given in exchange for

an equally or comparably valuable thing. How does this apply to the story?

» This applies to the story in that Long John Silver tells Jim Hawkins that Silver will

save Jim’s life if Jim saves his life in return. Silver will protect Jim from his group of

pirates, but if he does, he expects Jim to protect him from Jim’s group of honest

men. He expects an even trade—to protect Jim’s life in exchange for protection of

his own life (page 73).


3. **Literal.** In the conversation between Silver and Jim Hawkins, dialogue is used to

show rather than tell what happens. What do we learn from that conversation?


» A. The doctor has given Flint’s treasure map to Silver (page 73).


4. **Inferential.** The text says that Jim has a hard time sleeping while Silver

does not. What is being conveyed about these two characters? Are they

similar or are they different? What does this suggest about them as people?


» Answers may vary, but should include evidence from the text. Students may say

that Jim is a good person with a conscience while Silver is not. Jim feels bad about

what happened with the man earlier that day so he thinks about it and is kept up

at night by his thoughts; Silver does not feel bad about the things he does, so he is

able to sleep well without worrying (pages 76–77).


5. **Literal.** A simile is a comparison of two different things, usually using _like_ or

_as_ . There are several similes in this chapter, some of which are located on

pages 78 and 79. Record one simile exactly as it appears in the text.


» “We’ll keep him like gold, in case we need him later” (page 77).


» I had a line about my waist and followed after Silver like an obedient puppy (page 78).


» The dead man lay perfectly straight, with both arms raised above his head like a

diver (page 79).


6. **Inferential.** At the end of the chapter, Silver says, “Should be child’s play to

find the loot now!” From the context of the sentence, will it be easy or hard

to find the treasure? Use evidence from the text to support your answer.


» It will be easy to find the treasure. This is evident by the fact that Silver takes

bearings with his compass and says, “There are three tall trees, and they are in

the right line.” The way he says this suggests that they have followed the map

correctly and that the map and compass indicate they are near the treasure, and

the hard part is over (page 79).

 - Have students turn to Activity Page 1.3 and refer to the displayed

Character Chart.

 - Explain that students will take additional notes about Jim Hawkins and Long

John Silver. They will also record information about George Merry, a character
introduced in Chapter 8.

 - Use the information in the following chart to engage students in a discussion

about new information learned about Jim Hawkins and Long John Silver and

about the new character, George Merry. Tell students to draw on specific
details in their responses, such as descriptions of appearance, words, or
actions in the text.

will model how to use the Shape of a Story to draft the body of a story. As
you model, you will refer to the rubric on Activity Page 8.4. You may use the
following language as a guide:


“I already wrote the introduction to my story, so now, I will write the rising
action. The problem or conflict will be shown through the rising action. First,
I will look at what I wrote in the “Rising Action 1” section on Activity Page
7.2. I want to write this event like a story, instead of just a summary of what
happened. To do this, I will write the story as a series of small moments,
including dialogue and strong verbs that show what the characters are
doing.”


- Write a draft of the model story on a chart or display for students to see. As
you write, explain your thinking about where to include dialogue and strong
verbs. Have students share ideas about how to include dialogue and strong
verbs in the story. Draft as much of the story as time allows.

It was extraordinary how they regained their sense of **well-being** .
They shouldered their tools, and we set forth again. We passed two tall
trees and the third loomed up before us. It rose nearly two hundred feet
into the air, but it was not its size that impressed the men. It was the
knowledge that there was gold buried below its spreading shadow. The
thought of the money swallowed up their previous terrors. Their feet
grew lighter and speedier. Each man imagined the life of wealth and
extravagance that awaited him.


Silver hobbled forward on his crutch. He tugged furiously on the
line that held me to him and shot me a deadly look. He took no pains
to hide his thoughts. In the nearness of the gold, all had been forgotten.
His promise to me was a thing of the past. I did not doubt that he
hoped to seize the treasure, kill every honest man, and sail away laden
with crimes and riches.


We were now close to the spot, and the men broke into a run. Ten
yards further, we came to a halt. Before us was a great **excavation**, not
very recent, for the sides had fallen in and grass had sprouted on them.
In the ditch we saw a broken shovel. The treasure had been found and
rifled. The half a million pounds were gone.


The men were thunderstruck, but for Silver, the shock passed
almost instantly. His every thought had been set on the money. It had
staggered him to discover that it was gone, but he kept his head and
made a new plan in an instant.


“Jim,” he whispered, “stand by for trouble.”


He passed me a pistol and smiled at me, as if we were old friends.
I was so shocked by his constant change of heart that I couldn’t help
whispering, “So now you’re on my side again?”

There was no time for him to answer. Merry had found a single
coin in the pit. He held it up.


“A **guinea** !” he shouted furiously, shaking the coin at Silver. “That’s
all that’s left! That’s your half a million pounds of treasure, is it?”


Silver kept calm. He took a few steps back, keeping one eye on
Merry and the others.


“Mates!” Merry shouted, whipping out his cutlass. “Those two are
to blame! Silver and the boy! Let’s get ’em!”


Then—crack! crack! crack! Three muskets flashed out of the
thicket. George Merry tumbled headfirst into the excavation. Another
man spun like a top and fell to the ground. The other three turned tail
and ran for it with all their might.


A few seconds later, Dr. Livesey, Gray, and Ben Gunn stepped out
of the thicket with smoking muskets.


Silver did not try to escape. Instead, he shot George Merry.
Then he dropped his weapons and threw an arm around me. He called
out to Dr. Livesey, “Thank ye kindly, doctor! I’m on your side now—Jim
here will bear me out—and you arrived just in the nick of time for the
two of us!”


“So it is you, Ben Gunn,” added Silver.


“I’m Ben Gunn, I am,” replied old Ben.


After this exchange, Dr. Livesey explained what had taken place.
It was a story that profoundly interested Silver, and Ben Gunn was the
hero.

Support


_Superstitious_ means
“having irrational fears
about mysterious things or
the unknown.”



» Because the pirates are superstitious, they are frightened at the thought of

Captain Flint’s ghost coming back to haunt them. They are searching for Captain

Flint’s buried treasure, which he intended to claim for himself before he died. It is

possible they are concerned the ghost will hurt them or keep them from finding

the treasure.

**268**


During his lonely wanderings about the island, old Ben had found
the pointing skeleton, and later he had found the treasure. He had dug
up the loot and carried it away. It took many trips, but eventually he
stashed it all safely in a cave.


After the pirates attacked the stockade, the doctor had gone to see
Ben Gunn and had wormed the secret out of him. The next morning,
the doctor went to Silver and made a deal with him. He agreed to give
Silver the map, which was of no use anymore, along with some supplies.
The doctor and the others were eager to get away from the stockade.
They wanted to keep an eye on the cave where Ben Gunn had stored
the treasure.


That morning the doctor left the squire and the captain in the cave.
With Ben Gunn and Gray, he set out to **ambush** the mutineers. He
knew they would follow the map straight to the spot where the treasure
had been.


In order to arrive before the pirates, Dr. Livesey directed Ben Gunn
to call out in Flint’s voice. He guessed this might upset the superstitious
pirates, as in fact it did, and would give them time to arrive at the spot
first. Then the three of them hid in the thicket. They opened fire on the
mutineers when they turned against Silver and me.


“Ah,” said Silver, “it was fortunate for me that I was with Hawkins
here! If he hadn’t been here, you would have let old John be cut to bits
and never given it another thought.”


“Not a thought,” replied Dr. Livesey.


We marched back to the shore, got into one of the landing boats,
and set off for the _Hispaniola_ . When we got back to the ship, we sailed
her to a cove near Ben Gunn’s cave. Ben Gunn’s cave was large and airy.
There was a fire at the mouth of it, and Captain Smollett lay by the fire.

Jim, the doctor, and the others defend themselves against the pirates—to the

reader’s knowledge, he has been honest with these men. Alternatively, students

may say Silver is more trustworthy, as he does not kill or harm Jim when given

the opportunity. He makes a deal with Jim to protect him and, to the reader’s

knowledge, has upheld that deal. He shoots George Merry, which suggests that he

is indeed on the doctor’s side.

the text. Some students may say the voyage is ultimately a success because the

honest men find the treasure and most of them return home safely with a share

of it. Alternatively, some students may say the voyage is ultimately unsuccessful

because many of the men do not return from the island safely, and many men do

not receive a portion of the treasure.

Lesson 13 The Adventure Comes to an End
**273**


We sailed to a port on the coast of South America, where we were
surrounded by boats full of native people selling fruits and vegetables. I
went ashore for the day with the squire and Dr. Livesey. The sight of so
many smiling faces, the taste of tropical fruits, and, above all, the lights
of the town made a charming contrast to our dark and dangerous stay
on the island.


When we returned to the ship, Ben Gunn made a confession. Silver
was gone. Ben had helped him escape, though he assured us he had
done so to save our lives. That was not all though—the old sea cook had
taken with him a sack of coins worth four hundred guineas.


“I am pleased to be rid of him so cheaply,” said the doctor.


Well, to make a long story short, we got a few new hands on board,
made an enjoyable cruise home, and reached Bristol just as Mr. Blandly
was beginning to think of sending the rescue boat. All five of us got
a share of the treasure and used it wisely or foolishly, according to
our personalities. Captain Smollett retired. Ben Gunn got a thousand
pounds, which he spent or lost in nineteen days, for he was back
begging on the twentieth day. He is a great favorite, though, and is a
notable singer in church on Sundays.


Of Silver we have heard no more. That formidable man with one
leg has at last gone clean out of my life. I dare say he met his wife and
perhaps still lives in comfort with her and Captain Flint. I hope so, for I
fear that his chances of comfort in the next world are very small.


There is still more treasure hidden on that island: some silver bars
and some weapons that Flint buried. But nothing could tempt me back
there. The worst dreams I ever have are when I hear the waves booming
or when I bolt straight upright in bed, the voice of Captain Flint ringing
in my ears: “Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!”

Part A


Whose voice was it that came wailing out of the trees?


A. It was the ghost of Flint.


B. It was the voice of Ben Gunn.


C. It was the voice of George Merry.


D. It was the ghost of Darby M’Graw.


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**274**


Part B


What evidence from the text supports the answer to Part A?


A. One of the pirates recognized that the voice repeated the last words
Flint said before he died.


B. When the voice called out, it echoed. As the pirates said, spirits do not
have shadows or echoes.


C. Merry tried to convince the others that it was the ghost of Flint and then
warned John not to cross the spirit.


D. The pirates said it sounded like Ben Gunn. Later, Dr. Livesey, Gray, and
Ben Gunn stepped out of the thicket.


- Correct Answers: Part A: B; Part B: D


~~**CHAPTER DISCUSSION (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Bring the class back together as a group and use the following questions to
discuss the chapter.


**Inferential.** _Think-Pair-Share._ A turning point or climax is the point in a story when
the problem is addressed. Generally, this is an important event, which earlier events
lead up to. It is the most exciting point in the story. What event in this chapter would
you consider the climax of _Treasure Island_ ?


» The climax of the story is when the pirates finally reach the spot where the

treasure is supposed to be buried and find an empty hole. Dr. Livesey and Ben

Gunn drive most of the remaining pirates away and explain that they have the

treasure secured in a safe place. This is the climax because the entire story has

led up to uncovering the buried treasure. The story has also included a power

struggle between the mutineers and the other men, which comes to a turning

point in this scene.


**Inferential.** _Think-Pair-Share._ A resolution or end is the last part of a story. It is the
point in a story when the problem is resolved and the action calms. It is also when
the reader learns a story’s outcome. What would you consider the resolution of
_Treasure Island_ ?


» The resolution of the story is when the adventure concludes and the men return

home. Students may consider the scene in which the men meet back at Ben

Gunn’s cave to be the resolution; others may consider the scene in which the men

return home to be the resolution.

**Inferential.** When the narrator says, “Silver and the rest of us pressed on . . .,” what
does “pressed on” mean?


» It means the men continued their journey to find the spot where the treasure

was buried.


**Literal.** What evidence in the text helps you determine the meaning of _petrified_ ?


» “Their faces turned white with fear.”



Challenge


Ask students to explain
what words in the text
helped them understand
the meaning of _pressed on._


Support


_Petrified_ means
afraid or scared.



Lesson 14 The Characters of _Treasure Island_
**283**


Support


The expression “turning
their backs” is an
expression similar to
“walking away from”;
both mean “abandoning
something,” or “leaving
something behind.”


Support


The expression “Have you
ever heard of . . . ” is often
used to call attention to
something that rarely, if
ever, happens. Although
Silver phrases this as a
question, he does not
expect an answer.



Silver asks, “Have you ever heard of gentlemen of fortune turning their backs on
that much money?” Let’s unpack this sentence so we can understand what Silver
is saying.


**Inferential.** The phrase “gentlemen of fortune” is used a few times earlier in the
story. To whom is Silver referring when he says “gentlemen of fortune”?


» Silver is referring to pirates when he says “gentlemen of fortune.”


**Inferential.** What do you think Silver means when he asks, “Have you ever heard of
gentlemen of fortune turning their backs on that much money?”


» By asking this question, Silver means pirates would not and should not leave

behind the possibility of finding so much money. He is saying they should continue

on despite being scared.





Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**284**


**Inferential.** What does Jim mean when he says, “This argument seemed weak
to me”?


» Jim means it is not a strong argument—it is not very reasonable or convincing.


Silver says, “And come to think on it,” which is an idiom that means “after giving the
matter more thought.”



Support


What does _weak_ mean?

» not strong



Lesson 14 The Characters of _Treasure Island_
**285**


Support


What is being personified?

» The thought of money is
being personified.



It was extraordinary how they regained their sense of **well-being** .
They shouldered their tools, and we set forth again. We passed two tall
trees and the third loomed up before us. It rose nearly two hundred feet
into the air, but it was not its size that impressed the men. It was the
knowledge that there was gold buried below its spreading shadow. The
thought of the money swallowed up their previous terrors. Their feet
grew lighter and speedier. Each man imagined the life of wealth and
extravagance that awaited him.


Silver hobbled forward on his crutch. He tugged furiously on the
line that held me to him and shot me a deadly look. He took no pains
to hide his thoughts. In the nearness of the gold, all had been forgotten.
His promise to me was a thing of the past. I did not doubt that he
hoped to seize the treasure, kill every honest man, and sail away laden
with crimes and riches.


We were now close to the spot, and the men broke into a run. Ten
yards further, we came to a halt. Before us was a great **excavation**, not
very recent, for the sides had fallen in and grass had sprouted on them.
In the ditch we saw a broken shovel. The treasure had been found and
rifled. The half a million pounds were gone.


The men were thunderstruck, but for Silver, the shock passed
almost instantly. His every thought had been set on the money. It had
staggered him to discover that it was gone, but he kept his head and
made a new plan in an instant.


“Jim,” he whispered, “stand by for trouble.”


He passed me a pistol and smiled at me, as if we were old friends.
I was so shocked by his constant change of heart that I couldn’t help
whispering, “So now you’re on my side again?”


**82**


- Have students read the first three paragraphs on page 82 silently.


**Inferential.** The sentence, “The thought of the money swallowed up their previous
terrors,” is an example of personification. Personification is a literary device that
assigns human traits or characteristics to nonhuman things. What does the
sentence mean?


» It means the thought of the money they are about to dig up makes them forget

their fears about ghosts and dead pirates.



Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot
**286**


**Inferential.** Jim senses a change in Long John Silver. Jim tells the reader that Silver
“took no pains to hide his thoughts.” What does Jim mean by these words?


» Jim means that Silver makes no attempts to be honest or stay on Jim’s side at this

point. It is obvious to Jim that Silver has changed his mind about the agreement

between them.


**Inferential.** Jim says, “I did not doubt that [Silver] hoped to seize the treasure, kill
every honest man, and sail away laden with crimes and riches.” The word _laden_
means “heavy or carrying a large amount of something.” What does “laden with
crimes and riches” mean?


» This phrase means loaded with crimes and riches. Jim means that Silver plans

to leave loaded up with the treasure. In addition, Jim is saying that Silver will be

“loaded up” with crimes, meaning that he will have committed many crimes in the

act of getting the treasure for himself.


**Inferential.** Judging by how it is used in the text, what do you think _rifled_ means?


» It means “searched through and stolen.” The treasure had been found and taken

by someone else.


**Inferential.** Silver is surprised to find the treasure is gone, “but he kept his head and
made a new plan in an instant.” Jim senses yet another change in Silver. Why do you
think Silver is once again siding with Jim?


» If the treasure has been found, Silver understands it must have been found by Ben

Gunn, Dr. Livesey, and their crew. In order to get his share of the treasure, Long

John Silver must now switch sides and befriend Jim.


Check for Understanding


If students have difficulty answering this question, prompt with questions
such as: Who do you think found the treasure? What is their relationship
with Long John Silver? Do you think whoever found the treasure plans to
share with Silver? How can Silver fall back in favor with Jim’s crew?


Lesson 14 The Characters of _Treasure Island_
**287**


Support


Remind students a simile is a
literary device that compares
two different things,
usually using _like_ or _as_ .


Support


What is being compared?

» A man and a spinning top

are being compared.



There was no time for him to answer. Merry had found a single
coin in the pit. He held it up.


“A **guinea** !” he shouted furiously, shaking the coin at Silver. “That’s
all that’s left! That’s your half a million pounds of treasure, is it?”


Silver kept calm. He took a few steps back, keeping one eye on
Merry and the others.


“Mates!” Merry shouted, whipping out his cutlass. “Those two are
to blame! Silver and the boy! Let’s get ’em!”


Then—crack! crack! crack! Three muskets flashed out of the
thicket. George Merry tumbled headfirst into the excavation. Another
man spun like a top and fell to the ground. The other three turned tail
and ran for it with all their might.


A few seconds later, Dr. Livesey, Gray, and Ben Gunn stepped out
of the thicket with smoking muskets.


Silver did not try to escape. Instead, he shot George Merry.
Then he dropped his weapons and threw an arm around me. He called
out to Dr. Livesey, “Thank ye kindly, doctor! I’m on your side now—Jim
here will bear me out—and you arrived just in the nick of time for the
two of us!”


“So it is you, Ben Gunn,” added Silver.


“I’m Ben Gunn, I am,” replied old Ben.


After this exchange, Dr. Livesey explained what had taken place.
It was a story that profoundly interested Silver, and Ben Gunn was the
hero.


**83**


- Have students read paragraphs 1–6 on page 83, starting at the top of the page
and finishing with “ . . . with smoking muskets.”


**Inferential.** The sentence, “Another man spun like a top and fell to the ground,”
contains an example of a simile. What does the simile mean?


» It describes how quickly the man spins around to see where the musket

flashes came from. Then he falls to the ground, just as a top does when it has

finished spinning.

definition of suffix.


                - Remind students that the suffix – _ful_ means “full of” and the suffix – _less_ means
“without” or “lacking.” Remind students that when you add the suffix – _ful_ or

             - _less_ to the end of a noun, it becomes an adjective.


                - Ask students: How does adding the suffixes – _ful_ and – _less_ to the same root
word change the meaning?


» Adding the suffixes – _ful_ and – _less_ creates words with opposite meanings. For

example: _powerful_ and _powerless_ are antonyms, or words with opposite meanings.


Check for Understanding


Have all students use the suffixes – _ful_ and – _less_ to create a pair of
antonyms on index cards or sticky notes. For students having difficulty,
provide them with a root word, and have the students add the suffixes – _ful_
and – _less_ and explain the opposite meanings of the words.


                 - Tell students you will give them two word choices. Then, you will read a
sentence with a missing word and they must decide which word choice is
most appropriate in the blank.


                 - Practice with the following example:


                       - Faith or faithful? It is important to have and trustworthy friends.


                 - Ask students if _faith_ or _faithful_ would be most appropriate in the blank.


» _Faithful_, because it is an adjective that describes a noun, which in this sentence

is _friends_ .


**TEKS 4.3.C** Determine the meaning of and use words with affixes such as mis-, sub-, -ment, and -ity/ty and roots such as
auto, graph, and meter.

~~**UNIT ASSESSMENT (75 MIN.)**~~


 - Make sure each student has a copy of Activity Page 15.2. You may have

collected this activity page from students at the beginning of the unit.


 - Tell students they will read two selections, answer questions about each, and

respond to a writing prompt. In the next sections, they will answer grammar
and morphology questions, which evaluate the skills they have practiced in
this unit.


 - Encourage students to do their best.


 - Once students have finished the assessment, encourage them to review their

papers quietly, rereading and checking their answers carefully.


Check for Understanding


Circulate around the room as students complete the assessment to
ensure that everyone is working individually. Assist students as needed,
but do not provide them with answers.


**Reading Comprehension**


The reading comprehension section of the Unit Assessment contains two
selections and accompanying questions. The first selection is a literary
text that tells the story of the escape from the _Hispaniola_, as narrated by
Dr. Livesey, one of the characters in _Treasure Island_ . The second selection
is an informational text that describes how _Treasure Island_ has inspired our
way of thinking about such things as pirates and buried treasure.


These texts were created using standard quantitative and qualitative
measures. These texts are considered worthy of students’ time to read and
meet the expectations for text complexity at Grade 4. The texts feature core
content and unit vocabulary from the _Treasure Island_ unit that students can
draw on in service of comprehending the text.

Lesson 15 Unit Assessment
**299**


~~**OPTIONAL FLUENCY ASSESSMENT**~~ ~~**TEKS 4.4**~~


- You may wish to assess students’ fluency in reading, using the selection
“Robert Louis Stevenson.”


Administration Instructions







Turn to the student copy of “Robert Louis Stevenson” that follows the Unit
Assessment Analysis section. This is the text students will read aloud. Turn to
this copy each time you administer this assessment.




                - Using one Recording Copy of “Robert Louis Stevenson” for each student,

create a running record as you listen to each student read aloud.


                 - Call the student you will assess to come sit near you.


                 - Explain that you are going to ask them to read a selection aloud, and that you

are going to take some notes as they read. Also, explain that they should not
rush, but rather read at their regular pace.


                  - Read the title of the selection aloud for the student, as the title is not part of

the assessment.


                 - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the selection. As the

student reads aloud, make a running record on the Recording Copy using the

|following guidelines:|Col2|
|---|---|
|Words read correctly|No mark is required.|
|Omissions|Draw a long dash above the word omitted.|
|Insertions|<br>Write a caret (^) at the point where the insertion was made. If<br>you have time, write down the word that was inserted.|
|Words read incorrectly|Write an “X” above the word.|
|Substitutions|Write the substitution above the word.|
|Self-corrected errors|Replace original error mark with “SC.”|
|Teacher-supplied words|Write a “T” above the word (counts as an error).|



                - When one minute has elapsed, draw a vertical line on the Recording Copy
to mark where the student was in the text at that point. Allow the student to
finish reading the selection aloud.


Unit 6 _Treasure Island_ : X Marks the Spot

 - Assess the student’s comprehension of the selection by asking them to
respond orally to the following questions:


**Literal.** How did Stevenson pass the time when he was sick in bed?


» He made up stories with the help of his nurse.


**Literal.** Why did Stevenson wander over half the world?


» He was searching for a place that favored, or would be good for, his health.


**Literal.** Where did Stevenson and his wife ultimately settle down?


» on an island in the South Pacific


**Inferential.** What did people think of Stevenson?


» He was liked wherever he went because of his graceful, charming ways

and his sincerity.


 - Repeat this process for additional students as needed. Scoring can be done

later, provided you have kept running records and marked the last word
students read after one minute elapsed.

 - Students might make the following errors:


   - _enjoyable:_ using ‘oi’ instead of ‘oy’ for /oi/; using ‘u’ instead of ‘a’ for / ә /;
using ‘bul’ instead of ‘ble’ for /b ә l/


   - _predictable:_ using ‘k’ instead of ‘c’ for /k/; using ‘u’ instead of ‘a’ for / ә /;
using ‘bul’ instead of ‘ble’ for /b ә l/


   - _comfortable:_ using ‘k’ instead of ‘c’ for /k/; using ‘u’ instead of ‘a’ for / ә /;
using ‘bul’ instead of ‘ble’ for /b ә l/


   - _accessible:_ using ‘k’ instead of the first ‘c’ for /k/; using ‘s’ instead of the

                       - _endless:_ using ‘les’ instead of ‘less’ for /les/


                - Although any of the above student-error scenarios may occur, misspellings

may be due to many other factors. You may find it helpful to use the analysis
chart to record any student errors. For example:


Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


Is the student consistently making errors at the ends of the words?


Is the student consistently making errors in multisyllable words, but not
single-syllable words?


                 - Also examine the dictated sentence for errors in capitalization
and punctuation.

**Optional Fluency Assessment**


The following is the text for the Optional Fluency Assessment, titled “Robert
Louis Stevenson.” Turn to this copy of the selection each time you administer
this assessment.


You will also find a Recording Copy of the text for doing a running record of
oral reading for each student you assess. There is also a Fluency Scoring
Sheet. Make as many copies of the Recording Copy and the Fluency Scoring
Sheet as you need, having one for each student you assess.


**Robert Louis Stevenson**


Robert Louis Stevenson was born in Scotland in 1850. He was the son of

an engineer who built lighthouses. He was an only child and passed many
days sick in bed, where he made up stories with the help of his nurse. All his
life he was skinny and prone to illness, usually in his lungs. As an adult, he
wandered over half the world in search of a place that favored his health.


He studied first to be an engineer, and then a lawyer. He turned instead to
writing essays, plays, and stories. For a while, he wore long hair, floppy hats,
and velvet jackets. His parents believed he had become a wanderer.


While hanging out at an artist’s colony near Paris, he met Fanny Osbourne,
who would later become his wife.


In 1888, they sailed to the warm South Pacific, hoping the tropics would
be good for Stevenson’s health. For a year and a half, they roamed the
scattered islands. Finally they settled on one of the islands, where they
built a plantation house.


Wherever he went, Stevenson was liked for his graceful, charming ways and
his sincerity.


Though his health was better, the cares of his household were heavy. Fanny
had a nervous breakdown in 1893. The next year, in 1894, a frail Stevenson
died.


In his own time, his wandering life itself seemed a romantic adventure.
He wrote _Treasure Island_ in 1883 and it made him very popular. His
other famous stories include _The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_
and _Kidnapped_ .

place that favored his health. 74


He studied first to be an engineer, and then a lawyer. He turned 87


instead to writing essays, plays, and stories. For a while, he wore 99


long hair, floppy hats, and velvet jackets. His parents believed he had 111


become a wanderer. 114


While hanging out at an artist’s colony near Paris, he met Fanny 126


Osbourne, who would later become his wife. 133


In 1888, they sailed to the warm South Pacific, hoping the tropics 145


would be good for Stevenson’s health. For a year and a half, they 158


roamed the scattered islands. Finally they settled on one of the islands, 170


where they built a plantation house. 176


Wherever he went, Stevenson was liked for his graceful, charming 186


ways and his sincerity. 190

Though his health was better, the cares of his household were 201


heavy. Fanny had a nervous breakdown in 1893. The next year, in 214


1894, a frail Stevenson died. 218


In his own time, his wandering life itself seemed a romantic 229


adventure. He wrote _Treasure Island_ in 1883 and it made him very 241


popular. His other famous stories include _The Strange Case of_ 251


_Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_ and _Kidnapped_ . 258

**Guidelines for Fluency Assessment Scoring**

                 - To calculate a student’s W.C.P.M. (Words Correct Per Minute) score, use the
information you wrote on the Recording Copy and follow these steps. You may
wish to have a calculator available.


Count _Words Read in One Minute_ . This is the total number of words the
student read or attempted to read in one minute. It includes words the
student read correctly as well as words the student read incorrectly. Write
the total in the box labeled “Words Read in One Minute.”


Count the _Uncorrected Mistakes in One Minute_ . You noted these on
the Recording Copy. They include words read incorrectly, omissions,
substitutions, and words you had to supply. Write the total in the box labeled
“Uncorrected Mistakes in One Minute” on the Fluency Scoring Sheet. (A
mistake that the student self-corrects is not counted as a mistake.)


Subtract _Uncorrected Mistakes in One Minute_ from _Words Read in One_
_Minute_ to get _Words Correct_ . Write the number in the box labeled W.C.P.M.
Although the analysis does not include any words the student read correctly
(or incorrectly) after one minute, you may use this information from your
Recording Copy for anecdotal purposes.


                 - As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider:


It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.
scores. However, a major goal of Grade 4 is to read with sufficient fluency
to ensure comprehension and independent reading of school assignments
in this and subsequent grade levels. A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be
compared with the score of other students in the class (or grade level) and
also with the national fluency norms obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal
(2006). Hasbrouck and Tindal suggest that a score falling within 10 words
above or below the 50th percentile should be interpreted as within the
normal, expected, and appropriate range for a student at that grade level at
that time of year. For example, if you administered the assessment during
the fall of Grade 4, and a student scored 84 W.C.P.M., you should interpret
this as within the normal, expected, and appropriate range for that student.

Check for Understanding


Ensure students are revising effectively. Provide reinforcing or corrective
feedback, such as:

        - I’m pleased that you use dialogue in your story. I notice you have used

punctuation differently for moments of dialogue. Does the period go
inside or outside the quotation marks?


       - I noticed that you have only two moments of Rising Action. What is

another example you can include?


~~**MODEL DRAFTING A CONCLUSION (15 MIN.)**~~


- Tell students they will draft the conclusions to their stories today.


- Have students describe the purpose of a conclusion. (to solve the problem or

conflict and end the story)


- Explain that effective conclusions include a resolution. They also often circle

back to the beginning by referring to the introduction. _Treasure Island_ does
this effectively.


- Have students turn to page 88 of _Treasure Island_ . Select a student to read the

last three paragraphs of the story aloud.


- Have students turn to page 2 of _Treasure Island_ . Select another student to

read the first paragraph aloud.


- Have students explain how the story circles back and references the

beginning. (Jim starts the tale by telling the reader he will share a story. He
ends the tale by referring to himself as the storyteller again. Jim says “Well, to
make a long story short,” which reminds us of the beginning. He ends with the
same frame—telling the reader that he will end the story. Using this narrative
frame gives the tale a feeling of closure and completion.)


- Tell students that conclusions wrap up the story but may leave some loose

ends, meaning the problem or action in the story is not always completely
resolved. This keeps the reader wondering and thinking about the story even
after finishing it.


- Ask students what is left open-ended in _Treasure Island_, telling them to cite

specific examples in the last three paragraphs. (Long John Silver disappears;
there is still more treasure remaining on the island.)

dialogue and figurative
language to their stories.

~~**MODEL CREATING A TITLE (30 MIN.)**~~


 - Explain that a title is important because it is the author’s first chance to make
an impression on the reader.


 - Tell students that Robert Louis Stevenson originally titled his adventure story
_The Sea Cook_ .


1. Would you rather read a book entitled _The Sea Cook_ or _Treasure Island_ ?

Why?


» Most people would rather read _Treasure Island_ because it implies excitement and

possible adventure. We immediately ask questions like, “What kind of treasure?”

and, “Who will find it?” _The Sea Cook_ is not as interesting a title. We might ask

ourselves, “Who is the sea cook?” and, “Why is there a story about a sea cook?”

There is little interest and excitement beyond that.


 - Ask students what an effective title should accomplish (grab the reader’s
attention; tell what the story will be about.)


 - Explain that effective titles are also typically short and do not end with a period.


 - Tell students they will use _Treasure Island_ to explore titles in more depth.

~~**EMBEDDING THE EDITING PROCESS**~~ Allow students to continue
revising and editing.

Revising and editing can be challenging for students. It may be helpful to follow



the steps below to help your students as they revise and edit their own work.


This process can be done at the sentence level, in addition to extended written

pieces. By using students’ quick writes and shorter responses, instructional

time can be maximized and the writing process will be authentic to what

students are composing.


**Steps for Successful Editing**


1. Model the editing process during writing instruction and target a single skill at

a time.


2. Select a text with errors to provide guided practice in small groups.


3. Partner or pair students for collaborative practice using pre-selected texts

with errors.


4. Provide opportunities for students to practice independently by editing their

own work or the work of a peer.


5. Conference with students in small groups or individually to provide corrective

and informative feedback.


6. Repeat the process by modeling a new grammar or convention skill.


**Last, but not least...**


Lesson 17 Create a Title
**325**


 - Start with single sentences before moving onto longer pieces of writing.


 - Explicit grammar lessons can be reinforced using a variety of texts. Use

sentences from Read-Aloud or Student Reader texts to use as mentor

sentences.


 - Have students apply their understanding of a targeted skill in their short and

extended constructed responses.


 - Provide rehearsal opportunities during collaborative and independent writing

time.


 - Grammar is best taught in the context of student writing.


 - Incorporate spelling practice including use of high frequency words in written

compositions.

Set a timer<br>and have students pass their paper clockwise to the person<br>next to them. First round, highlight the nouns (plural) in the<br>text. Second round, underline sentences that have errors in<br>the noun’s usage. Third round, suggest an edit for the correct<br>usage. Fourth round, student agrees/disagrees with the edit and<br>makes necessary changes.|

Have students share out<br>their corrected sentence with the class for comparison.|
|4.11.D.v|<br>adverbs that convey<br>frequency and adverbs<br>that convey degree|<br>Target common errors in adverb usage such as<br>• Incorrect placement of adverbs (e.g., “She quickly ran”<br>instead of “She ran quickly”).<br>• Overuse or misuse of adverbs (e.g., redundant adverbs like<br>“very quickly”).<br>• Missing adverbs where clarification or emphasis is needed.<br>Model the correct usage of adverbs during writing instruction<br>and encourage students to use adverbs in written responses.<br>Collect responses and use one of the student’s written pieces to<br>edit as a class.|

|4.11.D.vi|prepositions and<br>prepositional phrases|Common errors include:<br>• Incorrect preposition usage (e.g., “She is in the home”<br>instead of “She is at home”).<br>• Incorrect prepositional phrase placement or structure.<br>• Missing or unnecessary prepositions.<br>After teaching students about the function and use of<br>preposition and prepositional phrases, have them notice them<br>in the texts they are reading. As editing practice, have students<br>take turns reading their written piece aloud to a partner.<br>The partner will listen for the incorrect usage and, together,<br>students can edit the sentence to make it correct.|
|---|---|---|
|4.11.D.vii|<br>pronouns, including<br>reflexive|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Provide sentences with subject-object relationships or with<br>multiple instances of reflexive pronouns. Engage students in<br>a class discussion about the errors and how to correct them.<br>Provide students with opportunities to edit their own pieces for<br>the correct usage of reflexive pronouns.|
|4.11.D.viii|<br> <br> <br> <br>coordinating<br>conjunctions to form<br>compound subjects,<br>predicates, and<br>sentences|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Provide students with stems that have different coordinating<br>conjunctions. For example, Cooking is rewarding because…<br>Cooking is rewarding, but…Cooking is rewarding, so… This is<br>a fun activity to tie to content students are currently learning<br>about because it can serve as a check for understanding for<br>comprehension. Students can edit their sentences after writing<br>them. Editing for coordinating conjunctions is appropriate to do<br>during revision when students are adding or rearranging their<br>details for clarity and coherence.|

Also, use pre-<br>selected texts that target a specific capitalization skill and then<br>add this specificity to your editing checklist. <br>|
|4.11.D.x|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>punctuation marks<br>including apostrophes<br>in possessives,<br>commas in compound<br>sentences, and<br>quotation marks in<br>dialogue|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Refer to specific lessons that address punctuation marks and<br>ensure students have an opportunity to edit for apostrophes<br>in possessives, as this is a challenging skill, especially when<br>working with plurals. Dialogue is also a bit tricky, so providing<br>students with mentor sentences for punctuation is helpful.<br>As always, have students use writing that they are currently<br>working on to edit for this skill.|
|4.11.D.xi|<br> <br> <br> <br>correct spelling<br>of words with<br>grade appropriate<br>orthographic patterns<br>and rules and high-<br>frequency words|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>  <br> <br> <br>Incorporate editing for correct spelling using skills that are<br>presented in the spelling lessons for each unit. After a pattern<br>has been addressed, draw students’ attention to that pattern<br>and include that as a part of the “editing for spelling” in the<br>editing checklist. For example, if students are working with<br>multisyllabic words with final stable syllables (generation, etc.),<br>then the editing for spelling target can be that particular skill.<br>Continually bring students’ attention to the high frequency<br>words they encounter in texts.|

Pausing Point


~~**PAUSING POINT FOR DIFFERENTIATION OF INSTRUCTION**~~


 - Please use the final three days of this unit to address results of spelling
assessments and the Unit Assessment (for reading comprehension; fluency, if
applicable; grammar; and morphology).


 - Note that the Pausing Point activity pages (PP.1–PP.6) provide additional
practice on irregular past-tense verbs, reflexive pronouns, conjunctions, the
roots _bio_ and _port,_ the prefixes _im–_ and _in–,_ and the suffixes _–ful_ and _–less._


~~**REMEDIATION**~~


**Content**

 - For a detailed description of remediation strategies that address lagging skills
in Reading Comprehension, Fluency, Grammar, Morphology, and Spelling,
refer to the Program Guide.


**Writing**

 - Use time during the Pausing Point to share adventure stories if there was not
enough time in Lesson 19. Allow students to finish publishing their stories, if
necessary. You may also choose to complete the optional publishing activity
outlined in Lesson 18. Meet briefly with individual students to discuss areas in
which improvement is needed.


 - You may wish to suggest that students who need more time to revise their
writing do so at this point. Methods of revision may include the following:


   - adding more details to the story


   - using more descriptive language and examples of imagery


   - connecting the conclusion to the introduction


   - presenting a character in more detail


 - Provide additional structure and guidance for students, making copies of
both the Adventure Story Rubric and the Adventure Story Editing Checklist
available (see the Teacher Resources section), and circulate and check in with
students as they write.


 - You may choose to have students engage in peer review during this time.
Students partner up to share their adventure stories. A partner uses the
Editing Checklist to comment on the story and provide suggestions for further
edits and revisions.

~~**ENRICHMENT**~~


                 - If students have mastered the skills in the _Treasure Island_ unit, their
experience with the unit concepts may be enriched by the following activities:


                - Students may read the enrichment selections contained in the Reader. “The
Voyage” is a chapter from the original _Treasure Island_ text written by Robert
Louis Stevenson. The “Blackbeard” selection tells of the life of Blackbeard, one
of the best-known pirates in history. The Activity Book contains activity pages
(E1.1 and E2.1) that students can complete as they read these selections.


                 - Also remind students that the original language of the text has not been
adjusted. This means historic language has been preserved in the text for the
purpose of this unit. Remind students that some words that we use today may
have had different meanings back then.


                 - Students may revisit Activity Page 14.1, which was completed during
Lesson 14. Students may share, either with a small group or with the class,
their responses to the questions on the activity page. Students may compare
and contrast with others. Students may also expand upon their answers and
discussions with further writing on the subject.


                - Students may respond to any of the following writing prompts, conducting
independent research when necessary to support their response:


                       - “I would recommend _Treasure Island_ to my friends because .”


                       - “ is the most interesting character because .”


                       - Write an alternate ending to _Treasure Island_ .


                       - Rewrite one scene from _Treasure Island_ from the perspective of Long
John Silver.


                       - Write a book review of _Treasure Island_ .


                 - Students may share, either with a small group or with the class, the writing
they generated in this unit or in response to the writing prompts in this
Enrichment section.

~~**EMBEDDING THE EDITING PROCESS**~~


Revising and editing can be challenging for students. It may be helpful to follow

the steps below to help your students as they revise and edit their own work.


This process can be done at the sentence level, in addition to extended written

pieces. By using students’ quick writes and shorter responses, instructional

time can be maximized and the writing process will be authentic to what

students are composing.


**Steps for Successful Editing**


1. Model the editing process during writing instruction and target a single skill at

a time.


2. Select a text with errors to provide guided practice in small groups.


3. Partner or pair students for collaborative practice using pre-selected texts

with errors.


4. Provide opportunities for students to practice independently by editing their

own work or the work of a peer.


5. Conference with students in small groups or individually to provide corrective

and informative feedback.


6. Repeat the process by modeling a new grammar or convention skill.


**Last, but not least...**

 - Start with single sentences before moving onto longer pieces of writing.


 - Explicit grammar lessons can be reinforced using a variety of texts. Use

sentences from Read-Aloud or Student Reader texts to use as mentor

sentences.


 - Have students apply their understanding of a targeted skill in their short and

extended constructed responses.


 - Provide rehearsal opportunities during collaborative and independent writing

time.


 - Grammar is best taught in the context of student writing.


 - Incorporate spelling practice including use of high frequency words in written

compositions.

|TEKS|Description<br>of Skill|Sample Activity|
|---|---|---|
|4.11.D.i|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>complete, simple, and<br>compound sentences<br>with subject-verb<br>agreement and<br>avoidance of splices,<br>run-on, and fragments|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Begin by focusing on simple sentences before moving onto<br>compound sentences. Take one skill at a time (i.e., subject-verb<br>agreement) and provide students with pre-selected text with those<br>errors. Once students are ready, move onto compound sentences.<br>Repeat the process with splices, run-ons, and fragments.  Have<br>students engage in peer editing or independent editing. This can<br>also be achieved by using student-generated work.|
|4.11.D.ii|<br>past tense of irregular<br>verbs|<br> <br> <br>Model writing sentences in shared writing activities to<br>demonstrate the correct usage. Hold students accountable for this<br>skill in their own writing and have students routinely edit for the<br>past tense of irregular verbs in their own writing or that of a peer.|
|4.11.D.iii|<br> <br>singular, plural,<br>common, and proper<br>nouns|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>In cooperative groups of 3-4, students will use a draft they are<br>currently working on to edit for a specific noun type. Set a timer<br>and have students pass their paper clockwise to the person<br>next to them. First round, highlight the nouns (plural) in the<br>text. Second round, underline sentences that have errors in<br>the noun’s usage. Third round, suggest an edit for the correct<br>usage. Fourth round, student agrees/disagrees with the edit and<br>makes necessary changes.|
|4.11.D.iv|<br>adjectives, including<br>their comparative and<br>superlative forms|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Provide short passages with errors in the usage of comparative<br>or superlative adjectives. Have students rewrite the sentence<br>to correct errors. This can be done as an independent activity,<br>or warm-up to open the writing lesson. Have students share out<br>their corrected sentence with the class for comparison.|
|4.11.D.v|<br>adverbs that convey<br>frequency and adverbs<br>that convey degree|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Target common errors in adverb usage such as<br>• Incorrect placement of adverbs (e.g., “She quickly ran”<br>instead of “She ran quickly”).<br>• Overuse or misuse of adverbs (e.g., redundant adverbs like<br>“very quickly”).<br>• Missing adverbs where clarification or emphasis is needed.<br>Model the correct usage of adverbs during writing instruction<br>and encourage students to use adverbs in written responses.<br>Collect responses and use one of the student’s written pieces to<br>edit as a class.|
|4.11.D.vi|<br>prepositions and<br>prepositional phrases|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Common errors include:<br>• Incorrect preposition usage (e.g., “She is in the home”<br>instead of “She is at home”).<br>• Incorrect prepositional phrase placement or structure.<br>• Missing or unnecessary prepositions.<br>After teaching students about the function and use of<br>preposition and prepositional phrases, have them notice them<br>in the texts they are reading. As editing practice, have students<br>take turns reading their written piece aloud to a partner.<br>The partner will listen for the incorrect usage and, together,<br>students can edit the sentence to make it correct.|
|4.11.D.vii|<br>pronouns, including<br>reflexive|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Provide sentences with subject-object relationships or with<br>multiple instances of reflexive pronouns. Engage students in<br>a class discussion about the errors and how to correct them.<br>Provide students with opportunities to edit their own pieces for<br>the correct usage of reflexive pronouns.|

|4.11.D.viii|coordinating<br>conjunctions to form<br>compound subjects,<br>predicates, and<br>sentences|Provide students with stems that have different coordinating<br>conjunctions. For example, Cooking is rewarding because…<br>Cooking is rewarding, but…Cooking is rewarding, so… This is<br>a fun activity to tie to content students are currently learning<br>about because it can serve as a check for understanding for<br>comprehension. Students can edit their sentences after writing<br>them. Editing for coordinating conjunctions is appropriate to do<br>during revision when students are adding or rearranging their<br>details for clarity and coherence.|
|---|---|---|
|4.11.D.ix|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>capitalization of<br>historical periods,<br>events and documents;<br>titles of books; stories<br>and essays; and<br>languages, races, and<br>nationalities|Use lessons and activities provided in the product for<br>capitalizing historical periods, events, documents, titles, stories,<br>essays, and languages, races, and nationalities. Also, use pre-<br>selected texts that target a specific capitalization skill and then<br>add this specificity to your editing checklist.|
|4.11.D.x|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>punctuation marks<br>including apostrophes<br>in possessives,<br>commas in compound<br>sentences, and<br>quotation marks in<br>dialogue|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Refer to specific lessons that address punctuation marks and<br>ensure students have an opportunity to edit for apostrophes<br>in possessives, as this is a challenging skill, especially when<br>working with plurals. Dialogue is also a bit tricky, so providing<br>students with mentor sentences for punctuation is helpful.<br>As always, have students use writing that they are currently<br>working on to edit for this skill.|
|4.11.D.xi|<br> <br> <br> <br>correct spelling<br>of words with<br>grade appropriate<br>orthographic patterns<br>and rules and high-<br>frequency words|<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>  <br> <br> <br>Incorporate editing for correct spelling using skills that are<br>presented in the spelling lessons for each unit. After a pattern<br>has been addressed, draw students’ attention to that pattern<br>and include that as a part of the “editing for spelling” in the<br>editing checklist. For example, if students are working with<br>multisyllabic words with final stable syllables (generation, etc.),<br>then the editing for spelling target can be that particular skill.<br>Continually bring students’ attention to the high frequency<br>words they encounter in texts.|

**Guidance for Teacher Use of Rubrics**


Rubrics are provided for evaluation of the content and structure of student
writing composed within each unit. The criteria within the descriptions
correspond to what is taught in the writing lessons. “Exemplary” to
“Beginning” performance columns provide graduated descriptions for
each criterion. The columns for “Strong,” “Developing,” and “Beginning”
performance are shaded to help students initially attend to the description
for “Exemplary” performance. The rubrics allow teachers and students to
identify graduated steps for improvement when aspects of the writing do not
meet all the taught criteria. To do this, teachers (and students) may highlight
the language from each row that best describes the student writing.

**Guidance for Teacher Use of Editing Checklists**


Editing checklists allow students and teachers to evaluate students’
command of language conventions and writing mechanics within unit writing
projects. They serve a different purpose from rubrics; rubrics measure
the extent to which students apply specific instructional criteria they have
been building toward across the unit, whereas editing checklists measure
the extent to which students apply English language conventions and
general writing mechanics. With regard to expectations for accountability,
we recommend using the editing checklist to measure students’ command
of language conventions and writing mechanics only when students have
received the appropriate instructional support and a specific opportunity to
review their writing for that purpose.


Evaluating Student Writing


Make enough copies of the rubric and editing checklist found in this section
to evaluate each student’s writing piece.


~~**RESOURCES FOR THE ENRICHMENT SELECTIONS IN TREASURE ISLAND**~~


The enrichment selections in _Treasure Island_ are intended to be used at
your discretion. They are intended to be read by more advanced readers,
as they are more difficult to read and include more challenging vocabulary
than Chapters 1–9. You may want to assign these chapters to students who
need more challenging reading material. An introduction to the selections
is provided here. Core vocabulary is also listed for each selection; these
words are bolded in the Reader and appear in the glossary. Following the
vocabulary chart, pronunciations are provided for words that may be
challenging to decode.


**Core Vocabulary for “The Voyage”**


“The Voyage” is a selection from the original _Treasure Island_ text by Robert
Louis Stevenson. It picks up after Jim brings the papers he finds in the
captain’s sea chest to Dr. Livesey and Squire Trelawney. Students can read
to find out how the selection is similar to and how it is different from the
adapted text in the Reader. Activity Page E1.1 corresponds to this enrichment
selection.


The following core vocabulary words are bolded in the selection and appear
in the glossary. Remind students they can look up a word in the glossary
if necessary.
