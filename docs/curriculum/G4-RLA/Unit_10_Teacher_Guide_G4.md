**Grade 4 Unit 10|**
##### Introduction


This introduction includes the necessary background information to be used in teaching the unit _Novel_

_Study: Number the Stars_ . The Teacher Guide for _Novel Study: Number the Stars_ contains twelve daily

lessons and one Pausing Point day. Each lesson will require a total of 90 minutes. Lesson 12 is devoted

to students’ presentations of their final projects. At the end of this unit, there will be an End-of-Year

Assessment, which should take no more than three days.


~~**INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS**~~


Along with this Teacher Guide, you will need:


 - Activity Pages


 - Digital Components


 - Exit Tickets


 - Family Support Letter


You will also need classroom copies of the Newberry Award-winning novel _Number the Stars_ by Lois

Lowry.


Also, students will need art supplies such as poster board, construction paper, colored markers,

scissors, glue, and computer access to build their final projects.


~~**WHY THE NOVEL NUMBER THE STARS IS IMPORTANT**~~


Showing elementary-aged students what it was like to live in Europe during World War II with a hopeful

tenor, _Number the Stars_ presents a prime opportunity to connect to themes around the importance of

courageous adherence to one’s ideals. This belief was exemplified by the Danish during World War II

and by the main characters in this book. The Danish population may not have been able to match the

might of the German military the way Allied forces did, but they mentally resisted, which young people

can relate to and be inspired by. In addition, it offers the opportunity for students to learn about World

War II as they build background knowledge in preparation for reading the story. For more information

about the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the

Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


The text that students will read and discuss in this unit provides opportunities for students to build

content knowledge and draw connections to social studies. You may build on class discussions to

support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strand of History from the Social

Studies TEKS. This content is not a replacement for grade-level social studies instruction.


Introduction
**1**


**Prior Knowledge**


Students who have received instruction in the program in Grades K–3 and up to this point in Grade

4 will have some pertinent background knowledge for this unit. These students may have gained

relevant background knowledge throughout the following units:


**Fighting for a Cause (Grade 2)**


Things to Know


- The fictional story in _Number the Stars_ touches on historic events that took place during World War II.

Please adjust accordingly.


- Resistance to German occupation is a core theme in _Number the Stars_ . This topic should be treated in

the context of its cause and consequence during this historical time period.


- Students will complete daily Exit Tickets to show their understanding of the learning objectives. The

Exit Tickets should be prepared in advance. Prepare to collect the Exit Tickets after students complete

them, then meet with students individually or in small groups the following day to review learning

objectives as needed.


~~**CORE VOCABULARY**~~


The following list contains all the core vocabulary words for _Novel Study: Number the Stars_ as they

appear in the novel and the lessons. Boldfaced words in the list have an associated activity or are

directly referenced within the instruction. The inclusion of words on this list does not mean that

students are immediately expected to be able to use all of these words on their own. However, through

repeated exposure throughout the lessons, they should acquire a good understanding of most of

these words and begin to be able to use some of them in conversation.

~~**WRITING**~~ ~~**TEKS 4.2.C**~~







In this unit, students use graphic organizers such as character development charts, charts for making

predictions and generating questions, Venn diagrams, and story puzzles to support note-taking,

analysis, and synthesis. They write daily Exit Tickets to practice and demonstrate their ability to make

inferences, make predictions, identify and explain literary themes, explain the author’s purpose,

explain the use of anecdotes, summarize the plot, and analyze character development. These daily

writing activities enhance their reading comprehension and writing skills.


These writing activities also support and scaffold instruction for the culminating task of the unit:

the _Number the Stars_ Character Analysis Project. For this project, students choose two or three

characters from the novel to focus on and analyze. Students use the notes and writing activities

completed throughout the unit to analyze characters’ development based on evidence from the

text and then craft a presentation of their analysis. The oral presentation of each _Number the Stars_

Character Analysis Project will last between four and seven minutes.


The following activities may be added to students’ writing portfolios to showcase student writing

within and across units:


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments.

  - Show students the front cover of the novel _Number the Stars_ by Lois Lowry.


  - Ask students to look at the front cover of the book. Tell students that during
this unit, they will be reading _Number the Stars_, a historical fiction novel that
takes place during World War II.


  - Tell students that historical fiction is a genre in which the fictional characters
are created by the author, but the surrounding setting and events are based
on historical fact. The struggles that the characters face are based on what
people during that historical time period actually experienced.


  - Think-Pair-Share: Have students share what might be interesting about
learning history from a fiction text with a partner. Give students an
opportunity to ask questions about historical fiction texts after this
discussion.


  - Explain that it is especially important to understand the setting when reading
historical fiction. Without background knowledge about the time period and
events, readers might have trouble understanding the characters and the
plot of the story.


  - Think-Pair-Share: Ask students to look closely at the images in Digital
Component 1.1. Then have them turn to a partner to share what they know
about World War II based on the images. Tell them to think about the mood
that the images create and the symbols, objects, and people that are
featured.

Instead, they will spend time learning about World War II during the first
lesson of the unit. This background information will help them understand
the novel on a deeper level.


 - Ask students to take out Activity Page 1.1. Tell students that this is a KWL
chart. It is a strategy that they will use to build background knowledge about
World War II.


 - Refer students to the columns “What I Know” and “What I Wonder” on
Activity Page 1.1.


 - Have students get together with a partner to write the things they already
know about World War II in the “What I Know” column. Instruct students to
write their questions about World War II in the “What I Wonder” column on
the chart.


 - When students are finished writing, ask for one or two volunteers to share
the things they know and what they wonder about World War II.


 - Tell students to keep Activity Page 1.1 handy and explain that they will go
back to it after the reading for this lesson.

ask students the following discussion questions:


1. **Literal.** Who were the two major alliances that fought in World War I? _(the_

_Allied Powers and the Central Powers)_


2. **Literal.** Who won World War I, and which countries were a part of the

winning alliance? _(The Allied Powers won, and the countries in the alliance_

_included Great Britain, France, Russia, and the United States.)_

- Display Digital Component 1.3.


**Digital Component 1.3: Maps of Europe in 1914 and 1933**


- Point out the Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, and Austro-Hungarian
Empire on the map of Europe from 1914. Then ask students the following
questions to compare the map from 1914 to the map from 1933. Ask
students:


1. **Literal.** What changes took place in the Russian and German Empires

from 1914 to 1933? _(The Russian Empire became the Soviet Union; the_

_German Empire was smaller in 1933 than it was in 1914; by 1933 there were_

_new countries in Eastern Europe in what were the Russian and German_

_Empires in 1914: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania.)_


2. **Literal.** What changes took place in what was the Austro-Hungarian

Empire from 1914 to 1933? _(The Austro-Hungarian Empire became four_

_countries: Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Austria, and Hungary. Yugoslavia in_

_1933 included what was Serbia in 1914.)_


3. **Literal.** What changes took place in what was the Ottoman Empire from

1914 to 1933? _(The Ottoman Empire became Turkey.)_


4. **Inferential.** Using what you read in “World War II & Resistance,” what

inferences can you make about why these changes took place? _(After_

_World War I, the Central Powers of World War I signed the Treaty of_

_Versailles. You can infer that the treaty broke apart each former empire.)_


- Explain to students that the Russian Empire broke down in 1917 and was not
related to the Treaty of Versailles. Tell students that the Soviet Union formed
in 1922 as a Communist country.


- Give students one or two minutes to record what they have learned in the
“What I Learned” column on Activity Page 1.1.


- Tell students to read paragraphs 5 through 10 independently.


- Ask students the following discussion questions:


1. **Literal.** How did the Nazi party appeal to more and more Germans in the

1920s and 1930s? _(Many Germans felt ashamed that their country was_

_once strong and now it was weak. They thought the Nazi party would be_

_better than their current leaders.)_


2. **Evaluative.** How might Hitler’s actions as the ruler of Germany have set

the stage for World War II? _(He angered other countries and groups of_

_people by establishing a totalitarian government in which some people_


Unit 10 Novel Study, _Number the Stars_


_did not have rights; he targeted groups of people for discrimination and_

_persecution, especially Jewish people; he directly violated the Treaty of_

_Versailles by building up the military and taking control of more land.)_


3. **Literal.** What event led to the official start of World War II? _(Germany_

_invaded Poland.)_


4. **Literal.** What were the two major alliances that fought in World War II, and

what countries were a part of each alliance? _(The Allied Powers included_

_France, Great Britain, and, later, the United States, the Soviet Union, and_

_China. The Axis Powers included Germany, Japan, and Italy.)_


- Give students one or two minutes to record what they have learned in the
“What I Learned” column on Activity Page 1.1.


- Direct students’ attention to Digital Component 1.4. Point to the colored
countries surrounding Germany. Explain that Germany under the Nazi party
invaded and occupied these countries from 1938 to 1940.


**Digital Component 1.4: Map of German Aggression Before WWII**


- Tell students to read paragraphs 11 through 13 independently. After reading,
ask students the following discussion questions:


1. **Literal.** Why did King Christian X decide to go along with Germany’s

demands when they invaded Denmark? _(He knew that Denmark was not_

_prepared and most likely would not win the fight. He wanted to protect the_

_Danish people.)_


2. **Evaluative.** We read that _Number the Stars_ takes place in Denmark.

Predict what might happen in the story, based on what we read about life

in German-occupied zones. _(The characters might get into trouble with the_

_German soldiers; they might have to deal with food and supply shortages;_

_the soldiers might search their homes and take things; they might try to_

_resist or fight back against the Germans in secretive ways; they might try to_

_save the Jewish people.)_


3. **Evaluative.** What point of view is “World War II & Resistance” written from

(first-person or third-person)? How might the information be different if it

were written from the point of view of someone living in Denmark during

the German occupation? _(Third-person; It might be different if it were_

_written in first-person because it would include more thoughts and feelings_

_of the people living during that time. It also might not include as much_

_information about the other events of World War II.)_



Support


Tell students the meanings
of _discrimination,_
_persecution_, and
_incarceration_ .
Discrimination is the unfair
treatment of a group
of people. Persecution
is the intentional, cruel
treatment of a group or
individual. Incarceration
means imprisonment, or
the keeping of a person in
captivity.


Support


Tell students that
_occupied_ and _resistance_
are multiple-meaning
words. The word
_occupied_ can also mean
busy or being used by
someone. The word
_resistance_ can also mean
the ability to oppose or
stop harmful forces. For
example, “Some people
have a higher _resistance_
to cold than others”.

 - Tell students to read the last two paragraphs of “World War II & Resistance”
independently.


 - Give students one or two minutes to record what they have learned in the
“What I Learned” column on Activity Page 1.1.


 - Direct students to examine Digital Component 1.5. Ask students to talk with a
partner about what new information or events they read on the timeline that
was not included in the text.


**Digital Component 1.5: Timeline 1914–1945**


 - Have students share one question they still have about World War II with
a partner. Then, tell students to write down at least one question they still
have at the bottom of Activity Page 1.1 in the section titled “What I Am Still
Wondering.”


~~**DISCUSS AND REFLECT (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students get together with a partner and use their KWL charts to
discuss their reactions to some of the information they learned about World
War II. Have students help each other reflect on the information and write
any questions they still have about World War II in the section titled “What I
Am Still Wondering” on Activity Page 1.1.


 - Have students discuss the following prompt, “What is your purpose for
reading this novel?” _(The purpose is to learn more about the perspectives and_
_experiences of people in Denmark under German occupation during World_
_War II.)_


 - Direct students to put their activity pages in their folders at the end of the
lesson.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to explain how the people of Denmark reacted to the
German invasion of their country during World War II. If students are
unable to explain that the Danish people resisted German soldiers in
secret ways, reread and discuss paragraphs 11 through 13 of “World War II
& Resistance.”

**Primary Focus:** Students will summarize the causes of World War II in a way that

maintains meaning and logical order. ~~**TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.7.D**~~


~~**MAKING CONNECTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Have the class divide into small groups of three to five students.


  - Tell students that they will be making connections between causes and
their effects. Remind students that causes are events or things that make
something else happen as a result, and effects are the results of the cause.
For example, a cause could be that the teacher did not explain the directions,
and the effect would be that the students are confused.


  - Remind students that they just read about the causes of World War II. Explain
that World War II began as a result of the actions of government leaders.
At the same time, those government leaders’ actions were also caused by
previous events. Tell students that people’s actions can have important
effects, and these effects can be good or bad.


  - Direct students to discuss the following prompts about causes with their
small groups:


1. Think about a time when your actions caused something good to happen.

What was your action? What were the effects of your action? _(Possible_

_answer: I helped raise money for my soccer team, so we were able to get_

_new uniforms.)_


2. When something happens to you that you don’t expect, does it help you

learn about what caused it? Why or why not? _(Possible answer: I like to_

_learn about what causes things to happen because it helps me understand_

_them better.)_


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.7.D** Retell, paraphrase or summarize texts in ways that
maintain meaning and logical order.

Unit 10 Novel Study, _Number the Stars_


**Universal Access**
Reading


  - Create a colorful, engaging version of Digital Component 2.2 and display it
in a place that is easy to access in the classroom. Students can participate
and contribute by making comprehensive illustrations for each section of the
chart. Students can refer to this chart throughout the unit and as they work
on their Character Analysis Project.


  - Prepare additional examples of how authors might use first-person and thirdperson point of view. For example, “Cinderella” is usually told in third-person:
“Once upon a time, a young girl avoided her stepmother and stepsisters
while she waited for her father to come home.” What if the story was told
in first-person, from the point of view of the fairy godmother? It could go
something like this: “As I saw the little girl for the first time, somehow I
knew that eventually she would need my magic to escape the cruelty of her
stepmother.”


Writing


  - Prepare question sentence starter frames for emergent bilingual support.
For example, “What is your . . .?” “Where do . . .?” “Who is your . . .?” “When is
your . . .?” “How did you . . .?” “Where did . . .?”


~~**CORE VOCABULARY**~~


  - Preview the vocabulary words before reading the text. As an option, in

##### Reading


**Primary Focus:** Students will establish a purpose for reading _Number the Stars_ .


~~**TEKS 4.6.A**~~


Students will identify and understand the use of literary devices, including first- or

third-person point of view.

~~**TEKS 4.10.E**~~


~~**CORE CONNECTIONS: INTRODUCE NUMBER THE STARS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Distribute and introduce the novel _Number the Stars_ by Lois Lowry.


  - Ask students to look at the front cover of the book. Then give them a minute
to read the short summary on the back cover.


  - Remind students that the novel is fiction, more specifically historical fiction.
Remind students that historical fiction is a made-up story but has the
realistic setting of a real time period and often real historical events and/or
people.


  - Think-Pair-Share: Direct students to share about the purpose for reading a
historical fictional text about an actual event or time period. Ask for a few
volunteers to share their thoughts.


    - After discussing, tell students that a fictional text about an actual event
can help us to relate to people of that time period and better understand
the context for the events that took place.


  - Display Digital Component 2.1. Tell students that the novel, _Number the_
_Stars_, takes place during World War II when Nazi Germany was invading
neighboring countries and persecuting the Jewish people.


**Digital Component 2.1: Map of WWII in Europe 1939-1945**


  - Think-Pair-Share: Direct students to share why they predict the author chose
the title.


    - After discussing, tell students that the illustration on the cover shows the
Star of David, which is a symbol for people of Jewish identity and/or faith.


**TEKS 4.6.A** Establish purpose for reading assigned and self-selected texts; **TEKS 4.10.E** Identify and understand the use of
literary devices, including first- or third-person point of view.


Lesson 2 Chapters 1 and 2: Annemarie and Ellen
**23**


**24**



Explain to students that David was the father of King Solomon, whom
students learned about in first grade. He was the second king of Israel and
an important figure in Jewish history. Remind students that during this
time in history, the Nazi regime was targeting and discriminating against
Jewish people throughout Europe.


 - Ask for a volunteer to identify the three characters mentioned in the
summary on the back cover. Ask for another volunteer to share details about
the setting.


 - Think-Pair-Share: Ask students to think about a friend or a relative who
lives in another city, county, state, or country. Ask students to consider
how everyday life may differ from their own lives. Explain to students that
some students’ friends may take a very long bus ride to reach their school,
particularly in rural areas, or that some students’ relatives in other states
must shovel snow from their driveways every morning just to get to school.
Have students turn to a partner and share one thing that a friend or relative
does that differs from what they may do in their home.


 - Explain to students that this novel study will help them grow in their reading
abilities and will challenge them to understand historical events from a reallife perspective rather than from a series of facts from a time period long
before they were born. Ask students to think about the purpose of reading a
novel like this.


 - Think-Pair-Share: Ask students to think about why it’s important to
appreciate other people’s perspectives and experiences. Then have them
turn to a partner and share their thoughts.


 - Display Digital Component 2.2. Explain to students that in this unit they
will practice reading to analyze the characters in the book, including their
different perspectives and experiences, and how their development is
connected to the key ideas in the story.


**Digital Component 2.2: Character Analysis Anchor Chart**


 - Explain that character development is the process by which a character
grows or changes in the story.


~~**POINT OF VIEW (10 MIN.)**~~


**First-Person and Third-Person (5 MIN.)**

 - Direct students’ attention to Digital Component 2.3.


Unit 10 Novel Study, _Number the Stars_


  - Share the information about point of view on Digital Component 2.3 with
students. Explain that there are three different points of view that authors
commonly use when they write: first-person, second-person, and thirdperson. Explain that for the purpose of this novel study, they will focus on
first-person and third-person point of view.


  - Explain to students that point of view is a literary device—a tool that authors
use to provide purposeful perspective.


  - Explain first-person point of view to students. Say, “When a story is written in
first-person, the speaker or narrator is a character in the story who is telling
it from their personal perspective and experience. When a text is written in
first-person, we often see the use of the word _I_ . The intentional personality
and tone of the text will depend on the character who is telling the story.”


  - Explain third-person point of view to students. Say, “Third-person point
of view is told from the perspective of someone outside the story who is
watching or experiencing things unfold for the characters. The third-person
point of view can be close to the characters, or it can be more detached and
objective. When a text is written in third-person, we often see the words _he_,
_she_, and _they_ . There are different ways a third-person perspective can sound
or feel in a text, depending on the author’s purpose.


  - Ask students whether they have any questions about first- and third-person
point of view or the information on Digital Component 2.3. After addressing
students’ questions, ask for volunteers to share which point of view they
prefer to use when they write (first-person or third-person).


Check for Understanding


Ask students to explain the difference between first- and third-person
point of view.


**Who Is the Narrator? (5 MIN.)**

  - Explain to students that the author, Lois Lowry, uses third-person point of
view in her novel _Number the Stars_ .


  - Explain that the narrator of the text is the person who is speaking or telling
the story. If a story is written in first-person, the narrator could be the author
or a character that the author has created and is using to tell the story. If
a story is written in third-person, the narrator is someone—the author or
someone else—who is watching or remembering what is happening to the
characters in the story.

**25**


Activity Page 2.1


Activity Pages
2.2 and 2.3




 - Ask students if they can tell who the narrator of the story is. _(Annemarie, a_
_ten-year-old girl)_


 - Tell students that the novel is narrated by Annemarie, a ten-year-old girl. It
is through her point of view that we understand the setting, events, conflict,
and resolution of the story.


 - Direct students to share what they think is the impact of this choice of
narrator. Allow students to share their ideas. _(The students are also that age,_
_so the author wrote the story using language and experiences the audience_
_would understand.)_


 - Ask students how the story might change if it were narrated from
Annemarie’s father’s point of view. _(The story would take a different turn and_
_would not involve Annemarie’s friends; it would have more adult problems.)_


 - Remind students that the point of view of the narrator can change how the
reader connects to the story. The narrator’s thoughts, feelings, and actions
influence the reader’s mood and perspective about the story elements.


 - Have students take out Activity Page 2.1. Then display Digital Component
2.4.


 - Tell students that their final project for this unit will be a Character
Analysis Project. Explain that they will use their creativity to build a textbased, visually engaging presentation that portrays a detailed analysis
of two or three characters in _Number the Stars_ . Tell students that there
are many creative ways to analyze a character’s perspective, experience,
and development. As the unit progresses, they will learn more about the
characters and different ways to analyze them.


 - Briefly go over the descriptions and qualifications in the Presentation Rubric
(Digital Component 2.4). Explain to students that they will go over the rubric
and the instructions for their final project in more detail in future lessons,
once they have read more of the novel.


 - Address any questions from students regarding their final project. Then have
them put Activity Page 2.1 in their unit folders.


~~**READ CHAPTERS 1 AND 2 (35 MIN.)**~~


 - Ask students to take out Activity Pages 2.2 and 2.3. Explain that they will
take notes about the characters and settings in the story as they read each
chapter.


Unit 10 Novel Study, _Number the Stars_



**26**


- Explain to students that, for the first lesson, you will model how to record
details, quotes, and ideas on Digital Component 2.5 as you read the text to
the class. Say that it’s helpful to record the chapter and paragraph number
where they find the detail, quote, or idea as they add to their notes. This way,
they can easily go back to that page if they have questions or want more
information.


- Display Digital Component 2.2 and read to students.


- Explain to students that they may use the information from the Character
Analysis Anchor chart (Digital Component 2.2) to help them decide what
details, quotes, and ideas to include in their notes as they read the novel.


- Tell students that, throughout the lesson, they will practice reflecting on their
notes with a partner.


Check for Understanding


Ask students how they might use the Character Analysis Anchor chart to
help them take notes for their final project. If students can’t explain that
the anchor chart gives examples of things to look for as they practice
reading, go over how Digital Component 2.2 and the final project align in
more detail.


- Begin reading Chapter 1 aloud to the students.


- Pause after reading the fifth paragraph and ask, “What characters have been
introduced?” _(Annemarie and Ellen)_


- Tell students to record the character names on Activity Page 2.2. Ask, “What
details can we already include in our character notes for Annemarie and
Ellen?”


  - Go to the Character Development Notes chart, prepared before the lesson,
and model note-taking by adding the following note:


   - Annemarie: Ch. 1, paragraphs 2 through 5: lanky, competitive, likes to
race, has silvery blonde hair


  - Add the following note for Ellen:


   - Ch. 1, paragraphs 2 through 5: stocky, prefers to be civilized, has dark
pigtails


- Continue reading to the sixth paragraph.



Support


Tell students the meanings
of _civilized, stocky, hesitated_,
and _residential_ while reading
them. Define _civilized_ for
students as having rules,
self-control, and good
manners. Define _stocky_ for
students as thick in physical
build. Define _hesitated_ for
students as paused. Define
_residential_ for students as
an area that is inhabited.


Support


Define _scowling_ for
students as to exhibit
displeasure with lowered

- Ask students, “What other character mentioned in the summary on the back
of the book has now been introduced? _(Kirsti)_


- Go to the Character Development Notes chart, prepared before the lesson,
and model note-taking. Ask, “What details and characteristics can we record
for Kirsti?” _(Ch. 1, paragraph 6: She is slower than Annemarie and Ellen. Ch._
_1, paragraphs 30 through 32: She is defiant when angry. She is stubborn. She_
_has short, tangled curls. She is unafraid. Ch. 1, paragraph 34: She is pretty.)_


- Ask students, “What else have we learned about Annemarie and Ellen?” Give
students an opportunity to share what notes from the text they would add
about Annemarie and Ellen. Add any correct notes shared by volunteers.


  - Model note-taking for character analysis by recording notes.


   - Annemarie: Ch. 1, paragraph 3: She is determined. Ch. 1, paragraph
14: She believes the German soldiers should learn her language. Ch. 1,
paragraph 15: She is polite. She is honest. Ch. 1, paragraph 18: She is
scared of the soldiers.


- Explain to students that they will only write down the details, quotes, and
ideas that stand out to them as being important.


- Ask students to recall how we have defined character development in this
unit. _(the process by which a character grows or changes in the story)_


- Tell students to think about this definition of character development to
determine the details they will include in their notes.


- Ask students what else we have learned about Ellen. Allow them to share.


  - Model adding notes to the character page:


   - Ellen: Ch. 1, paragraph 25: She has dark eyes. She is afraid of the
soldiers. Ch. 1, paragraph 26: She is a good student.


- Continue to read the rest of Chapter 1.


- Ask students what additional characters have been introduced. _(We have_
_been introduced to Mama, Mrs. Rosen, Peter Neilsen, and Papa.)_


- Model recording their names on Activity Page 2.2.


- Ask students what they have learned about the new characters and record
them on the chart: _(Mama: Ch. 1, paragraph 46: She has “coffee” with Mrs._
_Rosen. Ch. 1, paragraph 47: She is anxious about the girls’ interactions with_
_soldiers. Ch. 1, paragraph 54: She reads an illegal newspaper written by the_

_There isn’t freedom of the press. There is a secret Resistance movement that_
_damages the Germans’ vehicles and factories. Ch. 1, paragraph 66: There is no_
_butter or sugar available.)_


  - At the end of Chapter 1, ask students the following comprehension
questions:


1. **Literal.** Why is coffee, tea, butter, and sugar no longer available? _(The_

_German army takes the supply.)_


2. **Inferential.** Why are the characters afraid of the soldiers? _(The soldiers_

_are from another country who’ve “occupied” another country, uninvited, to_

_restrict the rights of the people whose country they’ve occupied.)_


  - Continue reading Chapter 2. Pause on the fourth page after reading the line
“Then I would too, Papa. If I had to.”

~~**TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.6.E**~~


~~**MAKING CONNECTIONS (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Divide the class into small groups of three to five students.


  - Provide each group with a large piece of chart paper and a set of colored
markers. Ensure that each group has enough space to work together to
complete the activity.


  - Tell students that we are going to practice making connections.


  - Ask students why making connections is important. _(It helps you understand_
_the character, choices, and events.)_


  - Tell students that the connections we make when we read a text are often
categorized as either Text-to-Self, Text-to-Text, or Text-to-World.


  - Explain that a Text-to-Self connection is where something in the text, such as
a character, setting, or event, reminds a person of their life and experiences.
A Text-to-Text connection is where a text they are reading reminds them of
another text. A Text-to-World connection is where the text reminds a person
of people or events in the world around them, whether past or present. For
example, consider what we have learned in previous lessons about World War
II. What connections can be made from that to the text? _(We learned about_
_King Christian X and the Danish resistance efforts in World War II in Lesson 1.)_


  - Direct students to write “ _Number the Stars_ Connections” in the center of
their chart paper. Model on a large piece of chart paper, which will be used as
an anchor example chart.


  - Tell students to draw an oval around the text.


  - Explain to students that they will create a concept map with their group to
share their connections.


  - Tell students to write “Text-to-Self” in one corner of their chart paper and to draw
an oval around it, leaving plenty of room to write below it. Tell students to draw a
line to connect that oval to the oval in the center. Model on the example chart.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Reading**


- Make sure students have their copies of the novel and their unit folders with

their Character Development Notes and other previously completed activity

pages.


- Prepare to divide the class into small groups of three to five students to briefly

recap important characters and events in the story so far. Use this time to

meet with students about their Lesson 2 Exit Tickets, either individually or

in small groups, to ensure students’ understanding of first-person and third
person point of view.


- Make sure students have their copies of the novel and their unit folders with

their Character Development Notes and other previously completed activity

pages. They will write notes about the characters on Activity Page 2.2 and

notes about the setting on Activity Page 2.3 as they read the novel and will use

their notes for various assignments, including their final project.


- Identify Digital Component 3.1 and prepare to display it.


- Prepare a chart or a copy of Activity Page 2.2 to model note-taking for

students.


- Prepare to display Digital Component 2.2, created in the previous lesson, in a

place that is easily accessible in the classroom for reference.


- Prepare to have students compare notes with assigned partners for part of the

reading segment.


- Write the following reading prompt on the board or chart paper: “Think about

the characters’ interactions in the story and describe the conflicts that you

observe.”


**Writing**


- Prepare a relatable anecdote to share with students. For example:


   - Teaching has its ups and downs, that’s for sure. During a class last week,

all my students seemed to be happily on task, writing their essays about

Shakespeare’s play _Romeo and Juliet_ . I thought they were really enjoying

the assignment. But when the fire alarm went off for a routine drill, they all

jumped out of their seats with jubilation as though it were time for spring

break. I heard one of them say, “Farewell, essay, parting is such sweet

sorrow!”


- Prepare to help students identify other anecdotes in the novel. For example,

Annemarie has a number of memories—Peter Neilsen delivering the _De_


Unit 10 Novel Study, _Number the Stars_


_Frie Danske_ newspaper and her parents reading, discussing, and burning it

in Chapter 1; overhearing her parents discuss the Resistance and it being

explained to her in Chapter 1; King Christian riding his horse and waving to

Annemarie and Lise; Papa’s story of overhearing a young boy say that all of

Denmark is King Christian’s bodyguard; her sister taking her to see the king in

the streets in Chapter 2.


 - Prepare for students to work with a partner during the Writing segment.


 - Prepare to distribute the Exit Ticket to each student to complete after the

anecdote discussion.

clash or a struggle for power between people or groups that usually involves

disagreement and sometimes aggression. People can also have inner conflicts,

issues, or internal struggles.


- Point to the reading prompt that is on the board: “Think about the characters’

interactions in the story and describe the conflicts you observe.”


- Ask students to think about this reading prompt as they read Chapters 3

and 4. Tell students that the outstanding conflicts in a story drive character

development and plot. Remind students that character development is the

process by which a character grows or changes in the story.


- Ask students to follow along as you read the text aloud and to take notes on

their activity pages in the way that was modeled for them in the previous

lesson. Remind students to write down the chapter number and page number

that correspond to the note they are adding.


~~**READ-ALOUD: CHAPTERS 3 AND 4 (30 MIN.)**~~


- Begin reading Chapter 3.


- Pause after reading the fourth paragraph of Chapter 3, which ends with “when

Lise and Annemarie shared this bed.” Ask, “Why was Annemarie fearful?” _(She_

_didn’t want to make her mother sad by mentioning Lise.)_


- Continue reading to Chapter 3, paragraph 18.


- Pause on Chapter 3, paragraph 18, after Annemarie says that her sister

is so dumb. Ask, “Why does Kirsti think the Hirsches went on vacation to

the beach?” _(She is young and doesn’t realize the danger presented by the_

_Germans.)_


- Continue reading Chapter 3. Pause at the end and say, “At the end of Chapter

3, Annemarie has a conflict. This conflict is with herself. In literature, that is

referred to as a “person versus self” conflict. We can tell that it is a conflict

because it involves an argument or power struggle. Can you identify what

problem Annemarie is wrestling with?” _(She wants to be brave, but she did not_

_know if she was brave enough to sacrifice her life.)_


- Ask students if they can imagine how Annemarie must be feeling now. Ask

students if Annemarie’s reassurance that ordinary people are never called

upon to be courageous is true. Allow students to share their opinions. Tell

students that making good choices in life is courageous. It is brave to do

something that is right when others around you may laugh or call you names.

Everyone has an opportunity to be brave.


Unit 10 Novel Study, _Number the Stars_


- Prompt students to consider whether Annemarie’s conflict will be important

to the development of her character. _(It will probably be important to the story_

_because it’s something that Annemarie is afraid of and may need to overcome.)_


- Begin reading Chapter 4.


- Pause after reading Chapter 4, paragraph 23, when Kirsti says “I don’t want

anyone to know.” Ask students what they notice about the interactions

between Kirsti and Mama, Annemarie, and Ellen. _(Kirsti is upset because she_

_does not like the shoes that Mama got her and refuses to wear them. )_


- Then ask, “Do you think this is a problem or a conflict?” _(It can be considered a_

_conflict because Kirsti has an argument or struggle with Mama. She’s conflicted_

_about wearing the ugly fish shoes)._


- Pause here and have a volunteer explain the difference between a problem and

a conflict in a text.


- Ask students what helped resolve Kirsti’s conflict. _(Ellen suggested asking her_

_dad to use ink to color the shoes black.)_


- Direct students to consider what this reveals about Ellen’s character. _(She is_

_compassionate and a peacemaker.)_


- Prompt students to identify what Kirsti’s conflict reveals about her character.

_(She does not understand the limitations of available goods. She likes pretty_

_things.)_


- Continue to read Chapter 4. Pause on Chapter 4, paragraph 42, after the

paragraph where Annemarie says she doesn’t want to play anymore.


- Ask students, “Why does Annemarie suddenly not want to play anymore?”

_(Remembering Tivoli and what happened to it upsets her.)_


- Tell students that the anecdote that Annemarie remembers reveals how Mama

has influenced Annemarie’s and Kirsti’s awareness of what is transpiring in

their country. Ask the students what Mama does to explain the booms that

woke them up that late August. _(Mama told them the booms were fireworks to_

_celebrate Kirsti’s fifth birthday.)_


- Ask the students what this interaction reveals about Mama’s character. _(She_

_wants to protect her daughters and calm their fears.)_


- Tell the students that Mama’s interaction with Papa also reveals information

about their characters. Mama said the king must feel sad to see his naval fleet

destroyed, but Papa believed the king to feel proud. Why do you think they

have different ideas about how the king must feel? _(Mama and Papa are using_

_their own feelings to guess how the king must feel. Mama feels sad to see her_

_country being destroyed, and Papa is proud that the king was willing to make_

_the sacrifice to stop the Germans from gaining more power by using the Danes’_

_fleet.)_

1. **Literal.** What is beginning to happen to the Jewish people in Denmark?

_(The Germans are beginning to arrest them and relocate them.)_


2. **Inferential.** Why does Mama ask for Annemarie when Peter visits? _(Mama_

_knows that Annemarie and Peter have a relationship. Also, Annemarie is_

_becoming aware of the danger for the Jews. Mama wants Annemarie to be_

_informed about what is happening without scaring her.)_


3. **Evaluative.** How do Annemarie’s interactions reveal that she is beginning

to understand the danger the Germans present? _(She shows concern for_

_the Jewish families and the need for Ellen to stay with her family. She lost_

_interest in pretending that times were as they used to be when playing with_

_Ellen and her sister. She senses the worry of her parents and Ellen and_

_becomes worried as well.)_


4. **Inferential.** Why was there no laughter and talk when the Johansens had

the opportunity to eat second helpings of chicken for dinner? _(Mama,_

_Papa, and Ellen were worried about Ellen’s parents.)_


5. **Inferential.** What does Papa mean when he says he once had three

daughters and he now has three again? _(Papa is referring to having Lise_

_as a daughter before she died. Now that Ellen is staying with them, she will_

_now be treated as his daughter.)_

6. **Evaluative.** Why was Peter visiting the Johansens after curfew dangerous

and frightening to Annemarie? _(She knew that there must be a serious_

_reason for Peter to risk being arrested by the Germans. Annemarie probably_

_feared for his safety and worried about what might have caused his visit.)_


  - Go to the reading prompt that was previously written on the board or chart.
Read the prompt aloud again for students: “Think about the characters’
interactions in the story and describe the conflicts that you observe.”

 - Ask for volunteers to share some of the notes they wrote down about Mama.

 - Ask students if they wrote notes about any other character.

 - Give students a minute to review and complete their notes about the

characters from the story on their activity page. Remind them that it’s not

necessary to write down every single detail about a character, only the ones

that stand out as interesting or important. If a certain detail, quote, or idea

changes their thinking about the character or tells them something new and

interesting, then it’s important to note.

 - Read the prompt aloud for students again: “Think about the characters’

interactions in the story and describe the conflicts that you observe.”

 - Give students a few minutes to write down their reflections about each

character in response to the prompt in the space provided.

##### Writing


**Primary Focus:** Students will identify and explain the use of anecdotes in

_Number the Stars_ .


~~**TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.10.G**~~


~~**WHAT IS AN ANECDOTE? (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that in this lesson they will learn about anecdotes.


 - Explain to students that an anecdote is a brief story about a person or

incident. Anecdotes are shared to connect with other people about a topic or a

message.


 - Provide students with a life-based example of an anecdote that a teacher

would share to help others relate to the teaching experience. For example:

    - “Teaching can be difficult, that’s for sure! During one of my classes last
week, all of my students seemed to understand the science assignment.
They were working so quietly and diligently. But when the bell rang for
dismissal, they jumped up, turned in their assignments, and left the class
with long faces. I heard one of them say, “T.G.I.F!”—or something like that.”


 - Explain to students what an anecdote is. Say, “People use anecdotes all

the time to liven up a conversation, to teach, and to write. People often use

relatable, funny anecdotes in speeches and presentations to engage their

audience by making them smile. Anecdotes can be true, or based on a true

story, but they are not to be confused with fact and usually can’t be used as

evidence to prove something in an argument. Anecdotes can also be made up,

or fictional. Sometimes they’re used for sharing life lessons. Authors of fiction

often include anecdotes in their stories to help bring their characters to life, as

the type of anecdote a character would tell can reveal something about their

personality. For example, in _Number the Stars_, Annemarie recalls anecdotes

often throughout the story. The most important thing to remember about

anecdotes is that people share them for a reason, often to help others relate to

a feeling or an experience.”


 - Tell students to turn to Chapter 4, paragraph 32. Say, “Annemarie recalls an

anecdote of going to Tivoli Gardens.”


**TEKS 4.2.C** write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.10.G** Identify and explain the use of anecdote.


Unit 10 Novel Study, _Number the Stars_


- Ask for a volunteer to read Annemarie’s anecdote about Tivoli Gardens.


- Ask students to explain why Annemarie remembers this anecdote and its role

in the story. _(She remembers it so the reader can see how the Germans have_

_changed their country and lifestyle.)_


Check for Understanding


Ask students whether anecdotes should be long or short narratives, and
why. _(They should be short because they’re meant to make a point or_
_share a feeling in the moment.)_


- Explain to students that sharing an anecdote is just telling a story. Remind

students that storytelling is one of the most meaningful ways in which people

communicate.


- Explain to students that an anecdote doesn’t have to be profound and isn’t the

same as writing a story with all the elements of a plot.


~~**DISCUSS ANECDOTES (15 MIN.)**~~


- Have students get together with a partner.


- Have students share responses to the following prompts with their partner:


1. Have you recently told someone in your life a funny story?


2. Do you remember what it was about, or did you tell it and then forget

about it?


3. Have you recently told someone in your life a more serious story about

something important?


4. Has a parent or a teacher recently shared an anecdote with you? What

was it about? Why did they share it?


5. What sorts of topics in _Number the Stars_ could be talked about using

anecdotes? _(an admired leader, changes at home or in the community,_

_going without, bullying, being different, respecting different cultural_

_backgrounds)_


6. Can you share an anecdote with your partner about a challenge at school?


 - Have students return to their individual seats.

60M
##### Reading


**Primary Focus:** Students will make and correct or confirm predictions about

the story of _Number the Stars_ . ~~**TEKS 4.6.C**~~


~~**RECAP (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Have students take out their copies of _Number the Stars_ and their unit
folders.


  - Hand Activity Pages 2.2 and 2.3 back to students.


  - Have students break into the predetermined small groups.


  - Ask students to refer to their notes to recap, or summarize, what has
happened in the novel so far in their small groups. Ask students to talk
with their group about the characters that have been introduced and any
important events.


  - Use this time to meet with students about Activity Pages 2.2 and 2.3, either
individually or in small groups, to help clarify students’ understanding of
character interactions, problems, and conflicts.


  - Have students return to their individual seats.


~~**PREDICTIONS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Explain to students that, when they read a novel, they often make predictions
in their minds of what they think is going to happen to the characters during
the course of events. Just like in life, when there is a problem, they often think
about whether it will be solved and how. When there is conflict in the novel,
they often make predictions about which character they think will win or
come out on top.


  - Explain to students that, without really thinking about it, they use details in
the text to make predictions. Explain that they always use what they already
know to make predictions.


  - Tell students to look at the conflicts from the novel recorded on their note
pages and ask for volunteers to share one with the group.


**TEKS 4.6.C** Make, correct, or confirm predictions using text features, characteristics of genre, and structures.

Support


Review characteristics
of the fiction genre with
students. Remind students
that almost all stories
follow a predictable
pattern. Show students the
Plot Anchor Chart in Digital
Component 3.1 and explain
that almost all stories have
a conflict that gets worse
and worse and then gets
resolved at the climax of
the story.



Lesson 4 Chapters 5 and 6: A Long Night
**55**


Challenge


Predicting naturally leads
to an understanding of
cause and effect. Ask
students to describe their
predictions using cause
and effect. For example,
Annemarie is happy to
see Peter, so she runs into
his arms.


Activity Page 4.1


**56**




 - Ask students to think about the story and the character interactions that are
involved in each of the conflicts. Ask for volunteers to explain some of these
character interactions.


 - Have students take out their Activity Page 4.1. Direct them to use the left
column to record predictions about the novel based on characteristics of
historical fiction. Remind students that this genre uses historic events or
people to tell a fictional story that is believable. Instruct students to make
predictions about the novel using what they learned about World War II in
Lesson 1.


 - Direct students to review the table of contents. Ask students to use the
structure of the novel to make predictions and record them in the left
column.


 - Tell students that during or after reading, they will confirm or correct their
predictions in the right column.


 - Ask students to work independently and write down how they predict things
will turn out for Ellen’s parents, Peter, Ellen, and the Johansens on the front
half of Activity Page 4.1 pages. Tell students they have five or six minutes to
complete this task.


 - When students have finished, have them get together with their assigned
partners to share and discuss their predictions. Ask students to explain
each of their predictions to their partner and why they think that is what will
happen, using details from the text.


 - Tell students that, if they want to, they may change the predictions recorded
in Activity Page 4.1 based on their notes and conversations.


 - After students have discussed their predictions, ask them to return to their
individual seats.


 - Explain to students that they will keep Activity Page 4.1 out to refer to their
predictions in future lessons and will record whether their predictions were
correct as events unfold in the novel.


~~**READ CHAPTERS 5 AND 6 (40 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that in this lesson, they will read Chapters 5 and 6 of the novel.


 - Ask students to take out their copies of _Number the Stars_ .


 - Tell students to follow along as you read Chapter 5.


 - Pause after reading Chapter 5, paragraph 8, which ends with “picked up her
hairbrush.” Tell students that the question of whether German soldiers will
come has been asked several times by now. Ask students, “Why do you think
the author repeats that question?” Allow students to share their ideas.


Unit 10 Novel Study: _Number the Stars_


- Tell students that it would seem the author is trying to get the reader to ask
the same question by bringing it up several times. Ask students why the
author might want the reader to wonder about this question. _(To show that_
_Ellen is worried about it; to give the reader a hint about what might happen; to_
_build tension.)_


- Tell students that authors often give hints to the reader in their writing of
things to come. It is called foreshadowing. Authors do this to make the
storyline believable, as the author has planted the seed for the reader to
expect what will happen. They also like to use foreshadowing to engage the
reader and build tension. Explain that foreshadowing is a literary device that
hints at future events in the plot to build tension.


- Tell students, “Now that we see the author hinting about whether the German
soldiers will come, record your prediction in Activity Page 4.1.” Give students
several minutes to record their predictions.


- Continue to read Chapter 5. Pause after reading Chapter 5, paragraph 23,
which ends with “pounding on the apartment door.” Ask students who they
predict is pounding on the door when it is still dark out. Allow students to
share their predictions. Prompt them to explain their reasoning.


- Continue to read Chapter 5. Stop after reading Chapter 5, paragraph 34,
which ends with “‘good friends the Johansens.’” Prompt students to reflect
on their predictions. Ask them if their prediction was correct. Direct them to
write in a complete sentence on the other side of Activity Page 4.1 whether
their prediction was correct or incorrect.


- Once students have finished confirming or correcting their predictions on
Activity Page 4.1, ask students what they predict will happen now that the
soldiers are in the Johansens’ apartment. Allow a few students to share their
predictions. Direct students to record their predictions on Activity Page 4.1.


- Once the students have finished recording their predictions, resume reading
Chapter 5.


- Stop after reading Chapter 5, paragraph 55, which ends with “From the
Rosens?”. Ask students what they predict will happen. Will it be discovered
that the Johansens are hiding Ellen? Direct students to record their
predictions on Activity Page 4.1.


- Once the students have finished, continue to read Chapter 5.


- After finishing Chapter 5, ask the following questions:


1. **Evaluative.** Why does Annemarie yank Ellen’s necklace off? Do you think

her behavior is excusable, considering that she broke Ellen’s necklace?

_(Annemarie yanks Ellen’s necklace off because the Star of David is a Jewish_

_Jewish and take her. Breaking the necklace is excusable because it kept_

_Ellen safe.)_


2. **Inferential.** Why did Papa tear the photographs of his daughters out of

their family photo album? _(Lise had dark hair when she was born, making_

_the photograph plausible as a baby picture of Ellen. The pictures were torn_

_out of the album so the soldiers wouldn’t see the dates written in the album_

_below the photos of when the pictures were taken. The date written below_

_Lise’s picture is too long ago to be believable as a photograph of Ellen.)_


- Prompt the students to reflect on what has happened in Chapter 5. Direct
the students to predict what the Johansens will do next and record their
predictions on Activity Page 4.1.


- Once students have finished writing, begin to read Chapter 6.


- Pause after reading Chapter 6, paragraph 31, which ends with “It was Ellen.”
Ask students to briefly summarize what has happened so far in the chapter.
_(Ellen, Annemarie, and Kirsti are not going to school. Instead, Mama is taking_
_the girls to visit Uncle Henrik. He is a fisherman and lives where you can see_
_across the lake to Sweden. Papa is staying behind because it is safer for the_
_family if he continues his normal routine. Papa called Uncle Henrik and told_
_him that Mama and the children are coming to visit and are bringing one_
_carton of cigarettes.)_


- Tell students to make and record a prediction for what will happen next. For
example, will Mama and the girls make it safely to Uncle Henrik’s?


- Once the students have finished recording their predictions, continue to read
Chapter 6.


- Pause after reading Chapter 6, paragraph 50, which ends with “along the
coast.” Ask students why the soldier asked Mama if they were going to
visit her brother for the New Year. _(The soldier asked Mama to discover if_
_they were Jewish because the Jews celebrate the New Year in October (and_
_sometimes September).)_


- Read the rest of Chapter 6, then ask the following questions:


1. **Inferential.** Why can’t Annemarie’s father go with them to Henrik’s? _(It_

_would be suspicious for all of the family to break their normal routines._

_Annemarie’s father must continue to go to work and live at home so the_

_Germans do not get suspicious.)_


2. **Inferential.** Why do Papa and Uncle Henrik talk on the phone about it

being a good day for fishing when Annemarie knows this is not true? _(Papa_


Unit 10 Novel Study: _Number the Stars_


_and Uncle Henrik are speaking in code. They are using the word fishing as_

_a code for hiding Jews in fishing boats. They are smuggling Jews out of the_

_country and don’t want the Germans to know.)_


  - Prompt the students to go back to their prediction of what would happen
next and record whether it was correct or not.


  - Direct students to add any new information they think is important to their
character and setting note pages.


~~**CONFIRM OR CORRECT PREDICTION DISCUSSION (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that today they practiced recording their predictions, and
they either confirmed or corrected their predictions. Ask students why
this is important. _(It is part of being a good reader. It helps to monitor_
_comprehension and analyze the story events.)_


  - Ask students to share good prediction strategies. Allow several students to
share and explain their reasoning. _(Look for clues and foreshadowing; analyze_
_chapter titles; make note of anecdotes; consider the possibilities)_

- Ask for a volunteer to read aloud the information in the first section of the
Theme Anchor chart to the rest of the class.


- Ask for a volunteer to read aloud the information in the second section of the
Theme Anchor chart to the rest of the class. Have students think of topics
that come up repeatedly in some of the stories they have read.


- Explain to students that examples of common general themes in works of
literature are survival, coming of age, and good versus evil. The more specific
message about each of these general themes would vary, depending on the
story. Ask students to think about and share other possible examples of
general themes. (love, courage, perseverance, heroism, etc.)


- Ask for one or two volunteers to share the title and theme of one of their
favorite stories or movies.


- Tell students that they will use their character notes to help them make
inferences and draw conclusions about emerging themes in the story.


- Tell students to review Activity Pages 2.2 and 2.3 to identify recurring topics
that possibly connect to broader themes. Explain to students that topics are
issues or subject matter addressed in the story. Explain that recurring topics
are often connected to a theme in the story. A topic will most likely be openly
talked about in the text while a theme requires students to make inferences
about the messages the author is trying to send.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to explain the difference between a topic and a theme.


- A sk for volunteers to share examples of clues for possible topics from their
Activity Pages 2.2 and 2.3 and explain why they chose to record those
specific details from the text.


- Explain to students that now that they have discovered some topics from the
text, they can use these topics to explore the emerging themes in the novel.


- Direct students’ attention to Digital Component 4.1 and Activity Pages 2.2
and 2.3.


Unit 10 Novel Study: _Number the Stars_


- E xplain that students will use topics that they have identified during the
reading to identify themes in the novel.


- T ell students to look at the Theme Anchor chart and explain that a theme is
the message or lesson from the story that a person can apply to their own
life.


- A sk students to follow along as you read the rest of the bullet points on the
Theme Anchor chart again. Emphasize to students that a novel can have
more than one theme, or overarching message, and that the more specific
topics connect to the themes.


- Have students take out Activity Page 4.2. Have a volunteer read the headings
on the chart. Explain that topics are the subject matter addressed in the
story. Tell students that topics can typically be stated in a few words, and
they help describe what the story is mostly about. The theme of a story will
be the message or the lesson the author wants the reader to understand
about the topics.


- Have students break out into their small groups and bring the novel and their
Activity Pages 2.2 and 2.3. Tell students to use their notes and work together
to decide on at least three topics, write questions about those topics, and
then determine possible emerging themes.


- To help students build this list of topics, have them start discussions in
their groups about the main characters, what each main character is going
through, and how the main characters respond to problems and conflicts.
Make sure the students understand that these words and phrases are not
themes because there is no message or lesson yet.


- Work with students to create two or three topics and record them on the
class copy of Activity Page 4.2. Have students record these topics on their
activity pages as well. Some ideas could be being brave, protecting others,
innocence, and family.


- Then have students pick a topic and turn it into a question. For example,
if one of the topics written down was being brave, ask, “What is this story
trying to teach you about being brave?” Have students discuss these
questions in their small groups.


- Remind students that by thinking about the message or lesson the story is
teaching them about each of these topics, they’re finding the themes of the
story.

##### Reading


**Primary Focus:** Students will identify elements of a plot and analyze the rising

action in _Number the Stars_ . ~~**TEKS 4.8.C**~~


~~**RECAP (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Have students take out their copies of _Number the Stars_ and their unit
folders.


  - Have students break into the small groups already prepared.


  - Ask students to refer to their notes in their unit folders to recap, or
summarize, what has happened in the novel so far in their small groups. Ask
students to talk with their groups about the important events in the chapters
they read in the previous lessons and to share recently added notes to their
Activity Pages 2.2 and 2.3.


  - Use this time to meet with students about their Lesson 4 Exit Tickets, either
individually or in small groups, to ensure students’ understanding of themes.


  - Have students return to their individual seats after the recap.


~~**PLOT ELEMENTS (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Display Digital Component 3.1.


  - Have students take out Activity Page 3.1.


  - Explain to students that most stories written in English follow a similar
pattern of composition. Refer to Digital Component 3.1 while explaining how
a story begins with an introduction; then describes the rising action, which
is driven by some sort of conflict; then reaches a turning point, called the
climax; then describes what happens after the turning point in the falling
action; and then finally reaches the resolution.


  - Ask for volunteers to read aloud the descriptions of each plot element to the
rest of the group. Ask students whether they have any questions about any of
these elements.


**TEKS 4.8.C** Analyze plot elements, including the rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution.

choose a story they
have read recently and
analyze it using the Plot
Anchor Chart.




 - Point to the “Conflict” bubble on the chart and explain that, at this point in
the story, various problems are part of the conflict that is complicating the
plot: Annemarie’s inner conflict, fear for the Rosens’ safety and well-being,
and the Germans tormenting the Jews.


 - Explain to students that the events in the story will eventually reach a turning
point, called the climax, which is the highest point of emotion or tension in
the story.


 - Explain to students that each story has its own plot curve and that the action
doesn’t rise the same way in every story.


 - Tell students that when they analyze a character in a story, it’s important
to think about the sequence of events that occurred and how those events
impacted the character.


 - Display Digital Component 3.1 somewhere in the classroom for students to
easily reference.


~~**CHAPTERS 7 AND 8 (30 MIN.)**~~

**70**


 - Remind students to take notes and ask questions about the characters and
setting for their project on their Activity Pages 2.2 and 2.3.


 - When students have finished reading Chapter 7, prompt student responses
with the following questions:


1. **Literal.** Why has Ellen never been to the sea? _(Her mother is afraid of it._

_She says it is too big and too cold.)_


2. **Evaluative.** Mama tells the girls not to speak to anyone because it is

dangerous. Why is it dangerous to try to explain Ellen to people they know?

_(With soldiers everywhere, they could overhear the mention of a guest or_

_friend and become suspicious.)_


 - Tell students to continue to read with their partners until the end of Chapter
8, taking turns reading paragraphs or pages.


 - When students have finished reading Chapter 8, prompt student responses
with the following questions:


1. **Inferential.** Why does Uncle Henrik say that it is a good night for fishing

when he fishes every day? _(It is code for something else.)_

Check for Understanding


Ask students to use one or two examples from the text to explain the
purpose of the introduction of a story. _(Introducing the character, setting,_
_and describing details about their lives and families.)_


 - Point along the plot curve on the chart and ask students to think about which
part of _Number the Stars_ they recently read. _(rising action)_


 - Have students take out Activity Page 5.1. Tell students that they will use
Activity Page 5.1 to analyze how the tension builds during the rising action.


 - Ask students what the rising action has been. Remind them that there is a
series of causes and effects that build tension through the rising action part
of the story. Explain that the rising action can be more than one event.


 - Give students about five minutes to reread the text and write the events that
cause tension to build during the rising action on Activity Page 5.1.


 - Use a different color sticky note and/or marker to represent the rising action
events.


   - _(The Hirsch family disappears.)_


   - _(The Germans get the list of Jews from the synagogue.)_


   - _(Ellen comes to stay with the Johansens.)_


   - _(Soldiers search the Johansen apartment.)_


   - _(Mama, Annemarie, Ellen, and Kirsti go to visit Uncle Henrik.)_


 - Have students record any events they missed on Activity Page 5.1.


 - Tell the students that while there weren’t any events that happened in
Chapters 7 and 8 to add to the timeline, the author built more tension by
introducing more conflict. Ask the students what conflict was introduced.
_(Annemarie is confused because Mama and Uncle Henrik say that the night is_
_good for fishing and that there will be a funeral for Great-Aunt Birte.)_


~~**PROJECT PREPARATIONS (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that recalling the sequence of events will be helpful as they
work on their _Number the Stars_ Character Analysis Project.


Unit 10 Novel Study, _Number the Stars_


  - Remind students that, for their final project, they will choose two or
three characters from the story to analyze in detail and then will create a
presentation that represents and explains their analysis.


  - Tell students that it’s time to decide which characters they’re going to
analyze for their project. Display or read the following list of _Number the_
_Stars_ characters they could analyze:


    - Annemarie


    - Ellen


    - Mama


    - Papa


    - Peter


    - Kirsti


  - Ask students which characters are the main characters in the story and how
they know that. _(The main characters are Annemarie and Ellen because the_
_author focuses on them in each chapter, and the story couldn’t take place if_
_they weren’t part of it.)_


  - Explain to students that they may choose to study Mama, Papa, Peter,
or Kirsti for one of their characters because they are well-developed, key
supporting characters.


  - Explain that the family members described can be included in the analysis
because they connect to the main and key supporting characters in the
story.


  - Ask students to think about which characters they will analyze before the
next lesson.


  - Prompt the students to record any new information learned about the
characters from today’s reading on their character development notes page.

##### Writing


**Primary Focus:** Students will explain the influence of the setting, including

historical and cultural settings, on the plot of _Number the Stars_ .


~~**TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.7.B; TEKS 4.8.D**~~


~~**WHY IS THE SETTING IMPORTANT? (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that the setting plays a very important role in a story. It provides
the context and circumstances that lead to the characters’ actions and
development of the plot. For example, if a character is thirsty, the problem
can be insignificant if they are sitting in their kitchen with easy access to
running water. However, if the character is thirsty, and the setting is the
middle of the Sahara Desert, the problem just became life-threatening.


  - Tell students to now visualize a knight from King Arthur’s court riding on his
horse. It is natural to place the knight in the setting of a castle or forest. He
is from that time period, after all, and the setting is appropriate. However,
imagine the knight riding his horse down the school’s hallway. Suddenly,
the event seems strange because it is not in its historical and cultural time
period.


  - Explain to students that the setting of a story is the full scene in which the
story takes place. The setting is the _where_ and the _when_ of the story. A
setting can be simple (like in the classic story “The Three Little Pigs”) or it
can be complex (like in _Number the Stars_ .)


  - Direct students to get their setting notes out and to check them for not only
the where, but the when. Ask volunteers to share from their notes.


    - _(The where of the setting is in Copenhagen, Denmark, and now also in_
_Gilleleje, Denmark, at Uncle Henrik’s farm.)_


    - _(The when of the setting is during World War II, when Germany was trying_
_to expand, and the Nazi regime began to persecute the Jews.)_


  - Show the students Digital Component 2.1 and point out Germany and
Denmark.


  - Tell students that Annemarie has mentioned how close Sweden is several
times in the story. Show students where the sea and Sweden are on the map.
Ask students if they think Sweden’s proximity is significant. Allow students to
share their thoughts.


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.7.B** Write responses that demonstrate understanding
of texts, including comparing and contrasting ideas across a variety of sources; **TEKS 4.8.D** Explain the influence of the
setting, including historical and cultural settings, on the plot.


Unit 10 Novel Study, _Number the Stars_


**Note:** Access to the coast and a nearby safe haven (Sweden) were unique
features of Denmark’s geography. This provided opportunities for rescue
missions that were not available in many other places, which were often
landlocked or far from safety. This setting was one of the keys to the
successful rescue of Jews from Denmark.


 - Ask students if the time period is significant to the story of _Number the_
_Stars_ . _(Yes. The story depends on the historical context of World War II.)_


 - Ask students if today’s technology would also be a factor that would affect
the rising action of the plot if the story were to take place today. _(Yes. Access_
_to information, records, photographs, etc., would change the circumstances of_
_the story’s events.)_


 - Prompt students to compare the actions of the characters in the novel to
the actions of a person they know in real life. How are the actions of the
characters in the book similar or different from the people in their life? Do
people look out for and protect their neighbors? Allow several students to
share their opinions.


~~**PARTNER PRACTICE (5 MIN.)**~~


 - Remind students that the setting is especially important to the plot in
historical fiction, such as _Number the Stars_ . Tell them that the setting helps
to build tension during the rising action.


 - Tell students that they will have five minutes to discuss the Exit Ticket
prompt with a partner.


~~**EXIT TICKET (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students return to their individual seats.


 - Distribute previously prepared Exit Tickets and allow students ten minutes to
complete them.

- Remind students to take notes and ask questions about the characters and
the setting for their project on Activity Pages 2.2 and 2.3.


- When students have finished reading Chapters 9 and 10, prompt student
response with the following questions:


1. **Literal.** What does Uncle Henrik mean when he says it is easier to be brave

when you don’t know everything? _(He means that her lack of knowledge of_

_the situation results in her ability to focus on the situation at hand without_

_fearing the worst.)_


2. **Inferential.** Why was it safer for Ellen to believe the Johansens lost

their Great-aunt Birte? _(If soldiers were to observe or question Ellen, her_

_responses wouldn’t betray the truth of the situation.)_


3. **Inferential.** What does it mean for Annemarie now that she knew that

Mama was lying? _(Annemarie now carried the same responsibility as Mama_

_by knowing the truth and lying about it.)_


4. **Evaluative.** What is significant about the Psalm Peter read from the

Bible at Great Aunt Birte’s funeral? _(Peter acts quickly to deflect German_

_soldiers from becoming suspicious of the large gathering of people at Uncle_

_Henrik’s house by reading a passage from the book of Psalms in the Bible._

_Reading a passage, also known as scripture, from the Bible during a funeral_

_was common practice. The specific passage, Psalm 147:4, read by Peter,_

_“He determines the number of the stars and calls them each by name,” is_

_significant because it gives the reader insight into the author’s connection_

_to the meaning behind the title of the book, Number the Stars. The author_

_directly connects a biblical passage, regarding Jewish persecution centuries_

_earlier with the persecution of the Jewish people by Nazi Germany during_

_World War II. It also alludes to the Star of David discussed in an earlier_

_lesson. The scripture was meant to serve as a reminder to the Jewish people_

_that their God, creator of the universe and all that is in it (the stars), is also_

_the creator of life, specifically knowing the name of every life. Even though_

_Peter knew the funeral wasn’t real, the potential danger of the German_

_soldiers learning the truth was real. Peter’s reading of the Bible brought_

_comfort to those gathered in Uncle Henrik’s home. It was a reminder that_

_their God, creator of all the stars in the sky, was also the creator of their life.)_


- Pause to give students time to analyze the reference in the text more

thoroughly. Encourage students to ask questions for clarification.


Unit 10 Novel Study, _Number the Stars_


~~**DISCUSS AUTHOR’S PURPOSE (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Display Digital Component 6.1.


 - Ask for a volunteer to read aloud to the rest of the group the purpose
descriptions in each of the three columns: Persuade, Inform, and Entertain
(PIE).


 - Tell students that understanding the author’s purpose for writing a story
or a text is as easy as PIE. Explain that an author may have more than one
purpose in mind when they write a fictional story, though.


 - Explain to students that an author’s purpose for writing a novel of fiction for
an audience is always to entertain readers with an engaging story. However,
an author of fiction may also want to inform the reader about a particular
topic.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to explain the difference between persuade and inform on
the PIE chart. _(To inform is to give information and awareness about a_
_topic whereas to persuade is to aim to convince someone of something_
_one way or the other.)_


 - Ask students to find Activity Page 4.2 in their unit folders. Have students
review their notes about the topics and themes of the novel from Lesson 4.


 - Ask students to name some of the recurring topics that the author has
included so far. _(being brave, protecting others, innocence, and family)_


 - Refer students to the reading prompt that you have written on the board or
chart. Read the prompt aloud again for students, “How and why does the
author bring awareness to certain topics through her story? Some topics
include being brave, protecting others, innocence, and family.”


 - Tell students to think about how the details and events in Chapters 9 and 10
bring awareness to being brave. Ask students to think about how the text
shows readers what it means to be brave.


 - Explain to students that in order to determine the author’s purpose for
writing a text, we also need to think about who they wrote it for. Ask, “Who
did Lois Lowry write this book for?” _(She wrote it for young readers in_
_elementary and middle school.)_

persuade, inform, or entertain her readers? _(Her purpose is to entertain_

_although she has generally informed the reader about certain topics.)_


2. **Literal.** Does the author give you any information about the World War II

time period in this book? If so, what information does she include? _(Yes,_

_the author talks about the curfew, limited supply of goods, the Danish_

_Resistance, and the danger to the Jewish people.)_

##### Writing


**Primary Focus:** Students will analyze how the different experiences of the

characters in _Number the Stars_ influences their perspective.


~~**TEKS 4.8.B**~~


~~**CHARACTER ANALYSIS (20 MIN.)**~~


  - Have students take out Activity Page 6.1.


  - Ask students which of the main characters knew about Great-Aunt Birte’s
funeral. _(Mama, Uncle Henrik, Annemarie, Ellen, and Kirsti.)_


  - Remind students that each of the characters had a different understanding
for the purpose of the funeral. Prompt students to compare Kirsti’s
understanding to Annemarie’s. _(Kirsti believed that Great-aunt Birte was real_
_and had died whereas Annemarie knew Great-aunt Birte was fictional. Kirsti_
_was curious but unconcerned with the death whereas Annemarie was upset_
_that she had been lied to.)_


  - Explain to students that, when we analyze characters and how they develop
in a story, it’s helpful to compare and contrast the characters in connection
with their experiences and perspectives. Explain that we must use evidence
from the text to do this.


  - Explain that an experience is an event or a sequence of events that someone
lives through.


  - Explain to students that someone’s perspective is the way they see, feel, and
understand something, based on how they have experienced it.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to explain how people can live through similar experiences
but have very different perspectives on those experiences.


**TEKS 4.8.B** Explain the interactions of the characters and the changes they undergo.

- Ensure that each group of students has a large piece of chart paper and color
markers to work with, as well as adequate space to discuss their work.


- Tell students to make a large version of the Venn diagram on Activity Page 6.1
on their chart paper.


- Tell students they will brainstorm, as a group, how Kirsti’s and Annemarie’s
experiences are similar and how they are different.


- Tell students that they may make more than one Venn diagram if they need
more space to write down the details, quotes, and ideas for their comparative
analysis.


- Give students time to brainstorm and discuss their ideas as they complete
the activity.


- Students may complete Activity Page 6.1 as they brainstorm with their group.


- When the activity is complete, have each group briefly share their Venn
diagram and name two or three things that Kirsti and Annemarie have in
common during their experiences and two or three things that make their
experiences different. Ask students to use their Venn diagrams to answer
the question, “How do the different experiences of Kirsti and Annemarie in
_Number the Stars_ influence their perspective?” in cursive on their activity
page.

##### Pausing Point


~~**PAUSING POINT FOR DIFFERENTIATION OF INSTRUCTION**~~


Please use one day after Lesson 6 to address students’ performance in this
unit. Use your observations of student performance in class and completion
of activity pages to informally evaluate student strengths and weaknesses
and determine which remediation and/or enrichment opportunities
will benefit particular students. In assigning these remediation and/or
enrichment activities, you may choose to have students work individually, in
small groups, or as a whole class.


~~**REMEDIATION**~~


For a detailed description of remediation strategies, which address lagging
skills in Reading Comprehension, Fluency, Language, and Writing, refer to the
Program Guide.


**Content**


If students demonstrate a need for remediation on any of the elements of
the _Number the Stars_ Novel Study unit, refer to the lessons covering that
element. You may wish to read any excerpt again as a teacher Read-Aloud.
In addition, you should focus on the suggestions labeled “Support” in the
Teacher Guide materials for that lesson.


~~**ENRICHMENT**~~


**Continuing to Work on Elements of Fiction**


Concentrate on elements of fiction, such as character, plot, and theme. This
is an opportunity to spend time with individual students, reading their work
and providing targeted feedback. You may wish to use the following listed
tools to help students work on elements of fiction.

~~**EMBEDDING THE EDITING PROCESS**~~


Revising and editing can be challenging for students. It may be helpful to follow

the steps below to help your students as they revise and edit their own work.


This process can be done at the sentence level, in addition to extended written

pieces. By using students’ quick writes and shorter responses, instructional

time can be maximized and the writing process will be authentic to what

students are composing.


**Steps for Successful Editing**


1. Model the editing process during writing instruction and target a single skill at

a time.


2. Select a text with errors to provide guided practice in small groups.


3. P artner or pair students for collaborative practice using pre-selected texts

with errors.


4. P rovide opportunities for students to practice independently by editing their

own work or the work of a peer.


5. C onference with students in small groups or individually to provide corrective

and informative feedback.


6. Repeat the process by modeling a new grammar or convention skill.


**Last, but not least...**

 - Start with single sentences before moving onto longer pieces of writing.


 - Explicit grammar lessons can be reinforced using a variety of texts. Use

sentences from Read-Aloud or Student Reader texts to use as mentor

sentences.


 - Have students apply their understanding of a targeted skill in their short and

extended constructed responses.


 - Provide rehearsal opportunities during collaborative and independent writing

time.


 - Grammar is best taught in the context of student writing.


 - Incorporate spelling practice including use of high frequency words in written

compositions.

2. **Inferential.** Why is the clothing shabby and old? _(It was probably donated_

_by Danish families that didn’t have much to spare.)_


3. **Evaluative.** Was it right for Mama to give a sweater that Kirsti loved to the

mother for her baby? _(Yes, because the baby didn’t have any clothing to_

_keep it warm.)_


4. **Inferential.** Why is it important that Uncle Henrik was not present when

the soldiers came? _(The soldiers may recognize him on his boat when he_

_takes the Jewish people in his boat to Sweden.)_

quiet? _(They know not to risk drawing the attention of the soldiers.)_


2. **Inferential.** Why does Annemarie think Papa would be wishing that Mama,

Kirsti, and she would be starting a new day with the sun shining and cream

on their oatmeal? _(It would indicate that they were safe and happy, enjoying_

_their time at the farm.)_


3. **Evaluative.** Why does the author say that Annemarie had to force her eyes

to understand and that they needed to understand, but she didn’t want

them to? _(Annemarie wanted to understand what she was seeing but was_

_afraid it would upset her.)_


- Ask students to take a few minutes to think about Chapters 11–12 and add
notes about the characters and the setting on Activity Pages 2.2 and 2.3.

chart. Read the prompt aloud again for students: “How does the author use
language to give you a sense of each character’s voice and build tension
during the rising action of the story?”


 - Ask for volunteers to share examples of words they wrote down in their notes
on Activity Page 2.2 for each of their characters.


 - Explain that the author’s use of language, like vocabulary, contributes to
a character’s voice and builds tension in the story. Remind students that
tension builds during the rising action of the story as the conflicts get worse
and worse, leading up to the climax.

of view. _(The use of pronouns she and he and a narrator telling the story.)_


- Ask students how the author’s use of third person point of view contributes
to Annemarie’s voice in the story. _(The author’s use of third person point of_
_view gives the reader access to the character’s thoughts and feelings as well_
_as actions, so there is no question about what she’s experiencing or how she_
_feels in the moment. We know that she is figuring out what is going on and_
_realizes the danger they are in as the story progresses.)_


- Ask students for some words and phrases that contribute to Annemarie’s
voice in Chapters 11 and 12. _(daydreams, frightened, cold, gone, alone,_

no longer have the comforts of home or nice clothing. They are waiting to go
with Mama through the dark forest to face things that frighten them.”


 - Direct students to look at option A. Read it aloud. Ask students if the
paragraph is talking solely about Ellen’s fears. _(No.)_


 - Tell students to look at option B and read it aloud to them. Ask, “Does this
paragraph have anything to do with Uncle Henrik being loud?” _(No.)_


 - Say, “Next, we look at option C.” Read it to students before prompting, “Is this
paragraph about the Germans being cowards?” _(No.)_

_saw her mother lying on the ground outside of the house after she had been_
_gone with the Rosens overnight.)_


- Direct students to read Chapter 13.


  - Facilitate, monitor, and assist students as needed while they are
completing their reading and the activity page.


- After students read Chapter 13, prompt student response to the text with the
following comprehension questions:


1. **Literal.** What happened to Mama on her journey home? How did this

impact her return home? _(Mama tripped over a root and hurt her ankle._

_She had to crawl back to make it home before the morning.)_


2. **Inferential.** Why did Mama plan on telling the doctor a different story

about how she got hurt? _(Mama planned on lying to the doctor because_

_she could not let anyone know that she was bringing the Rosens and others_

_to the boat to escape.)_


3. **Evaluative.** What is the importance of Mama saying, “It may all have been

for nothing” in Chapter 13, paragraph 26? _(It is important that Mama said_

_“It may have been all for nothing” because it prompts Annemarie, and the_

_reader, to understand the importance of the envelope.)_


4. **Inferential.** Why did Mama avoid telling Annemarie about the contents

of the envelope? _(Mama was trying to protect Annemarie from having to_

_come up with a different story if she was questioned by the soldiers.)_


- Direct students to read Chapter 14.


  - Facilitate, monitor, and assist students as needed while they are
completing their reading and the activity page.


- After students read Chapter 14, prompt student response to the text with the
following comprehension questions:


1. **Inferential.** Which fairytale did Annemarie think of during her journey to

the harbor? _(Little Red Riding Hood)_ What are the similarities between

the fairytale Little Red Riding Hood and Annemarie’s journey? _(Both the_


Unit 10 Novel Study, _Number the Stars_


_fairytale and Annemarie’s journey are about a young girl traveling in the_

_woods with a basket of food. The journey is frightening for both girls since_

_they do not know what is in the woods.)_


2. **Inferential.** Why would it be dangerous for Annemarie to walk by the road

where it’s lighter? _(It would be dangerous for Annemarie to walk by the_

_road because she could be seen and questioned by a German soldier.)_


3. **Inferential.** Why do you think Annemarie retold this fairytale as she

walked to the harbor? _(Annemarie thought of Little Red Riding Hood. She_

_thought of this to distract her from her own journey.)_


4. **Inferential.** Who did Annemarie encounter in the woods? How does this

impact the plot? _(Annemarie encountered soldiers and their dogs. This_

_impacts the plot because it is where the story reaches its greatest moment_

_of tension, just as Annemarie is on her way to save Ellen and the Rosens.)_


- Think-Pair-Share: Ask students to think about which event or part of the
story is the climax. Remind students that the climax is usually when the
biggest question is about to be answered, the story reaches the greatest
moment of tension, the tension stops building, and the story changes
direction from rising action to falling action. Have students turn to a partner
and talk about the climax of the story plot.


  - Ask for two volunteers to share what they discussed with their partners
with the rest of the group.


- Ask students to recall the big questions in the story. _(Will the Rosen family,_
_including Ellen, be safe from the Germans? Will Jews in Denmark be safe?)_


- Ask students whether they think the climax is when Mama returns home
from her journey after guiding the Rosens and others to the boat or when
Annemarie goes on her journey to deliver the envelope in order to ensure
their safety. Ask students to hold up one finger if they think the climax is
when Mama returns home or to hold up two fingers if they think the climax is
when Annemarie goes out to deliver the envelope.


- Explain to students that the most important thing to keep in mind when
identifying and analyzing the climax of the story is to find where the story
changes direction from rising action to falling action. In this novel, the direction
of the story changes when Annemarie goes to deliver the envelope because
this will make sure that the Rosens are safe from the Germans. The reader
also feels that Annemarie will be a part of the rescue, which calms the tension
around whether Annemarie will be able to rescue her friend from the Germans.



Challenge


Remind students that
Annemarie compared her
journey to the fairytale
Little Red Riding Hood. Tell
students to select another
story or fairytale that is

##### Reading


**Primary Focus:** Students will analyze the falling action and resolution in _Number_

_the Stars_ . ~~**TEKS 4.2.C; TEKS 4.8.C**~~


~~**RECAP (5 MIN.)**~~


  - Have students take out their copies of _Number the Stars_ and their unit
folders.


  - Have students break into pre-prepared small groups.


  - Ask students to refer to their notes to summarize what happened in the
chapters they read for the previous lesson. Ask them to talk with their groups
about the climax of the novel.


  - Use this time to meet with students about their Lesson 8 Exit Tickets, either
individually or in small groups, to ensure students’ understanding of climax
and falling action and to check how they’re addressing these elements of the
plot in their final projects.


  - Have students return to their individual seats.


~~**CHAPTERS 15 AND 16 (35 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that today they will read chapters 15 and 16 of the novel _Number_
_the Stars_ . Ask them to take out their copies of the novel.


  - Ask students to take out Activity Page 9.1.


  - Have the students point to the “Resolutions and Changes” box on Activity
Page 9.1. Tell students that this box is the focus of today’s reading lesson.


**Note** : Students may take notes and write questions as they have done
regularly in the other sections on Activity Page 9.1, especially in the
“Relationships” box, but they will pay close attention to resolutions and
changes for each character.


  - Remind students that, in a character analysis, a resolution is a character’s
answer, determination, or conclusion in response to a problem.


**TEKS 4.2.C** Write legibly in cursive to complete assignments; **TEKS 4.8.C** Analyze plot elements, including the rising action,
climax, falling action, and resolution.

Support


Pull a small group of
students who need
additional support to help
them determine what
text evidence they should
add to the resolutions
and changes portion of
Activity Page 9.1.


Support


Give students examples
of resolution. For example,
a student struggles with
concepts in science class
and feels like giving up,
but then she identifies one
scientific topic that she likes
and her attitude about the
class changes from then on.


**128**




- Remind students that, in a character analysis, a change is how any aspect
of the character, including their perspective and their actions, becomes
different. Tell students that a character’s perspective is typically changed
during the falling action of the story.


- Point to the reading prompts that are on the board, “What happened as a
result of the climax?” “What is the resolution for each character at the end
of the story?” and “What has changed for the characters since they were
introduced at the beginning of the story?”


- Ask students to think about responses to these reading prompts as they read
and take notes on Chapters 15–16.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to define character development. Ask them to explain why
analyzing the resolution at the end of the story is important for analyzing
overall character development. (Character development is how a
character grows or changes in the story. Understanding their resolutions
at the end of the story helps clarify how they have changed overall.)

       - Ask students to read the text and to take notes on Activity Page 9.1.


       - Direct students to read Chapter 15.


          - Facilitate, monitor, and assist students as needed while they are

completing their reading and the activity page.


- After students finish reading Chapter 15, pause and ask the following
comprehension questions:


1. **Literal.** Who did Annemarie try to act like when she encountered the

soldiers? _(Annemarie tried to act like her little sister, Kirsti.)_


2. **Evaluative.** Why did she act this way? _(Annemarie tried to act like her little_

_sister Kirsti because she was young and naive. Annemarie thought that if_

_she acted silly like a young girl, then the soldiers would let her go.)_


3. **Literal.** What was Annemarie’s response when the soldiers asked why

Uncle Henrik did not eat fish? _(Annemarie said that Uncle Henrik did not_

_like fish after seeing and smelling it all the time.)_


4. **Inferential.** Why was it beneficial that Annemarie did not know what was

in the envelope? If Annemarie knew what was in the envelope, how would


Unit 10 Novel Study, _Number the Stars_


it have changed the events? _(It was beneficial because Annemarie did not_

_have to lie to the soldiers when they questioned her about the envelope._

_If Annemarie knew, she may not be as confident in her answers and the_

_soldiers may have been more suspicious.)_


 - Direct students to read Chapter 16.


   - Facilitate, monitor, and assist students as needed while they are
completing their reading and the activity page.


 - After students finish reading Chapter 16, pause and ask the following
comprehension questions:


1. **Evaluative.** Why was it important that the baby remain asleep? _(It was_

_important because if the baby made any sounds, the Germans would find_

_their hiding place on the boat.)_


2. **Evaluative.** How did Peter help to prevent the Germans’ search dogs

from finding the Jews on the boats? Why was his role so important to the

resolution? _(Peter asked doctors and scientists to devise a way to make_

_the search dogs lose their sense of smell. His role was important to the_

_resolution because it enabled the Rosens to find safety from the Germans.)_


3. **Evaluative.** If Annemarie was unable to deliver the handkerchief,

what would have happened? _(If Annemarie was unable to deliver the_

_handkerchief, then the Germans would have found Ellen and the rest of the_

_Jewish people hiding on Uncle Henrik’s boat.)_


~~**ANALYZE THE FALLING ACTION AND RESOLUTION (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students take out Activity Page 3.1.


 - Display Digital Component 3.1, Plot Anchor Chart, for students to view.


 - Ask for a volunteer to point to the “Falling Action” portion on the plot curve.


   - _Think-Pair-Share:_ Ask students to describe what happens in the falling
action of a plot. _(The falling action addresses the details of the conflict after_
_the turning point.)_


 - Explain to students that the falling action of the plot is typically a result of the
character’s reaction to the climax or conflict.


 - Ask for a volunteer to point to the “Resolution” portion on the plot curve.


   - Think-Pair-Share: Ask students to describe what happens in the resolution
of a plot. _(The resolution ties everything together at the end of the story.)_



Support


Pull a small group of
students who need
additional support to help
them determine what text
evidence they should add to
the resolutions and changes
portion of Activity Page 9.1.

Discuss the purpose of
the plot elements. What
happens if there is no
resolution? Would you
read other books from
the same author?


**130**




- Explain to students that resolutions and changes can be analyzed for each
character, but the resolution of the plot usually puts the final touches on how
the main conflict and problems are fully resolved in the story.


- Ask the following comprehension questions:


1. **Inferential.** Why did Uncle Henrik say “Because of you, Annemarie,

everything is all right” (Ch. 15, paragraph 53)? Why is it important to

the reader that Uncle Henrik says this? _(Uncle Henrik said this because_

_Annemarie brought the important envelope to Uncle Henrik. This is_

_important to the reader because it is a turning point in the story. This_

_moment shows the reader that Annemarie’s feelings changed from worried_

_to relieved in response to the climax or conflict.)_


2. **Evaluative.** What key elements ensured Ellen and the Rosens’ safe travel

to Sweden? Why were these so important? _(The medicine for the baby_

_was important because it put her to sleep. The handkerchief was important_

_because it ruined the dog’s sense of smell when they were searching for_

_Ellen and the Rosens. The Rosens’ hiding spot under the fish was important_

_because the German soldiers did not want to look beneath the fish for the_

_Jewish people. This all ensured their safe travels to Sweden because it_

_prevented the Germans from finding them.)_


- Tell students that this historical fiction story about Annemarie’s family
helping the Rosens escape is an example of what many Danes across the
country did to help Jews during the war. Denmark was a remarkable country
where everyday people united to save their Jewish neighbors, and they did so
at a moment’s notice and at great personal risk.


3. **Evaluative.** Why was it important that Annemarie knew if Ellen heard her

on the boat? _(It was important for Annemarie to know if Ellen heard her on_

_the boat because Annemarie wanted to ensure that her friend knew she did_

_everything she could to make sure her friend was safe from the Germans_

_and that she cared for her.)_


- Go to the reading prompts that you have written on the board or chart. Read
the prompts aloud again for students: “What happened as a result of the
climax?” “What is the resolution for each character at the end of the story?”
and “What has changed for the characters since they were introduced at the
beginning of the story?”

  - Remind students that an analysis is a detailed study or examination of
something. An analysis breaks something down, or looks at each part or
element to evaluate its significance to the whole.


  - Explain that analyzing the characters gives us a deeper understanding of the
characters and the story as a whole.

Unit 10 Novel Study, _Number the Stars_



**140**


 - Tell students that, after a quick class discussion of the reading, they will
answer the reading prompt independently for their Exit Ticket.


 - Have students read Chapter 17 independently.


 - Remind students to take notes about the characters for their project on
Activity Page 10.1.


 - When students have finished reading Chapter 17, prompt student response
with the following questions:


1. **Literal.** Why was everyone celebrating in Denmark? What types of things

did they do to celebrate? _(Everyone was celebrating because the war had_

_ended and Germany no longer occupied Denmark. People celebrated by_

_raising the Danish flag, singing the national anthem of Denmark in the_

_streets, and ringing church bells all over Copenhagen.)_


2. **Evaluative.** What is the significance of the yellow dress that Annemarie

finds? _(Annemarie takes out Lise’s yellow dress because it’s where she_

_hid Ellen’s necklace. This is significant because Lise was also a part of the_

_Resistance. The yellow dress kept Ellen’s necklace safe just as Lise and_

_Annemarie helped to keep the Jewish people safe.)_


3. **Inferential.** What does Annemarie wearing Ellen’s necklace explain? Why

is this important? _(When Annemarie wears Ellen’s Star of David necklace,_

_it explains that Denmark is free. It does not show that she was trying to_

_be Jewish, rather that her Jewish neighbors were welcome to live freely in_

_Denmark. This is important because it shows the complete resolution to the_

_story and the hope that Annemarie will see her friend Ellen again.)_


 - Give students a few minutes to think about the events and details described
in Chapter 17 and finish making notes on Activity Page 10.1.


~~**ANALYZE CHANGES A CHARACTER UNDERWENT (25 MIN.)**~~


 - Refer students to the reading prompt that you have written on the board or
chart. Read the prompt aloud again for students: “How have the characters
Annemarie and Ellen changed since the beginning of the story when they
were running home from school?”


 - Think-Pair-Share: How did the characters Annemarie and Ellen act and feel
at the beginning of the story? _(The characters were innocent and childlike_
_as they went home from school. They did not have any idea about what was_
_happening in their world concerning the Germans.)_

- Display Digital Component 3.1, Plot Anchor Chart. Explain to students that
a character is impacted by the elements within a story. Ask students which
element they believe most greatly impacts a character and causes them to
change.


  - Ask a few students to share their ideas about the plot elements that cause
a character to change.


- Explain to students that the conflict, rising action, and climax of a story can
influence a character and cause the character to undergo changes. Typically,
in the falling action and resolution, the reader can see how the character has
changed overall.


- Ask students to review their Character Notes in their Unit Folders and recall
how the characters acted in each part of the story.


- Remind students that many events have happened since Annemarie and
Ellen were running home from school and encountered the German soldiers.


- Think-Pair-Share: Think about Annemarie and Ellen during the conflict,
rising action, and climax. What events impacted their characters the most?
_(Answers may include: Annemarie and Ellen were most impacted when the_
_Rosens left Ellen to be with Annemarie’s family, when soldiers came looking_
_for Ellen and she pretended to be Annemarie’s sister, and when they traveled_
_to Uncle Henrik’s to find safety.)_


- Explain to students that these events impacted both Annemarie and Ellen.
Tell students to think about how these events made Annemarie and Ellen
change from the innocent and childlike characters at the story’s beginning.


  - Ask a few students to share their ideas about the characters’ changes.


- Think-Pair-Share: Think about the resolution of the story. What events reveal
how Annemarie and Ellen have changed? How did these events show their
changes? _(Annemarie and Ellen’s changes are revealed when Annemarie_
_dropped off the handkerchief and asked if Ellen could hear her. This showed_
_how Annemarie was concerned about the safety of her friend which_
_demonstrated her growth and maturity. This also showed Ellen’s bravery as_
_she sat in silence upon hearing her best friend.)_


- Read the reading prompt aloud again: “How have the characters Annemarie
and Ellen changed since the beginning of the story when they were running
home from school?”

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**End-of-Year (EOY) Assessment**

 - Prepare to distribute Activity Page A.1 that you collected from students at the
beginning of the unit.


 - Please plan to have reading material available for students to select from and
read independently as they finish the EOY Assessment.


The primary purpose of the EOY Assessment is to determine students’
preparedness for Grade 5 instruction.


~~**END-OF-YEAR ASSESSMENT**~~


During the first day of the three-day assessment, all students will complete
the Reading Comprehension Assessment (Activity Page A.1) independently.
It includes three passages and corresponding comprehension questions.
After students complete this portion of the assessment, use the EOY
Assessment Summary (Activity Page A.2), which you will have collected from
students, to analyze each student’s performance. Please score the Reading
Comprehension Assessment prior to Day 2 of the EOY Assessment, as you
will use the scores to determine which students should complete the Word
Reading in Isolation Assessment.


Beginning on Day 2 of the EOY Assessment, all students will work
independently on the Grammar Assessment (Activity Page A.3).


End-of-Year Assessment
**163**


**164**



In addition, you will pull students aside, one at a time, and administer the
Word Reading in Isolation Assessment (to students who scored 10 or fewer
on the Reading Comprehension Assessment, or 11–13, as time allows).
Administer the Fluency Assessment to all students.


The Word Reading in Isolation Assessment uses Activity Page A.4 (Word Reading in
Isolation Assessment Scoring Sheet), which you will have collected from students,
as well as the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment located in the Teacher
Resources section of this Teacher Guide. A Word Reading in Isolation Analysis
and a Word Reading in Isolation Remediation Guide have also been included in
Assessment Day 2.


The Fluency Assessment uses Activity Pages A.2 and A.5 (which you will have
collected from students), as well as the student copy of the Fluency Assessment text
“Paul Bunyan,” located in the Teacher Resources section. You will use Activity Page A.5
(End- of-Year Fluency Assessment Recording Copy) to create a running record while
students read the fluency passage. Activity Page A.2 (End-of-Year Assessment
Summary) includes a Fluency Assessment Scoring Sheet.


On Day 3 of the EOY Assessment, all students will complete the Morphology
Assessment (Activity Page A.6). You will continue to pull students individually to
administer the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment and the Fluency Assessment.


~~**READING COMPREHENSION ASSESSMENT (90 MIN.)**~~


- Ensure each student has a copy of Activity Page A.1. You may have collected
this activity page from students at the beginning of the unit.


 - Have students work independently to complete the Reading Comprehension
Assessment on Activity Page A.1. After you have scored the assessment,
record individual scores on each student’s EOY Assessment Summary
(Activity Page A.2).


The texts used in the Reading Comprehension Assessment—“Mercury and
the Woodman” (literary text), “Benjamin Banneker” (informational text), and
“The Circulatory System” (informational text)—have been profiled for text
complexity using standard quantitative and qualitative measures.


Unit 10 Novel Study, _Number the Stars_


The reading comprehension questions pertaining to these texts are aligned
to standards and are worthy of students’ time to answer. Questions have
been designed so they do not focus on minor points in the text, but rather,
they require deep analysis. Thus, each item might thus address multiple
standards. In general, the selected-response items address Reading
standards and the constructed-response items address Writing standards.
To prepare students for digital assessments, some items replicate how
technology may be incorporated in those assessments, using a paper and
pencil format.

**Reading Comprehension Assessment Analysis**


Students who answered 10 or fewer questions correctly out of 15 total
questions appear to have **minimal preparation** for Grade 5. Administer
the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment and the Fluency Assessment to
these students to gain further insight as to possible weaknesses. These
students may have fairly significant skill deficits and may not be ready for
Grade 5. Carefully analyze their performance on the Reading Comprehension
Assessment, the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment, and the Fluency
Assessment to determine whether students may need to be regrouped to an
earlier point of instruction in the grade level materials when they reach Grade 5.


Students who answered 11–13 questions correctly out of 15 total questions
appear to have **adequate preparation** for Grade 5. Administer the Word
Reading in Isolation Assessment to these students, as time permits, and
administer the Fluency Assessment. Use results from the Word Reading in
Isolation Assessment to identify gaps in the mastery of specific letter-sound
spellings that may require targeted remediation in Grade 5.


Students who answered 14–15 questions correctly out of 15 total questions
appear to have **outstanding preparation** for Grade 5. You do not need to
administer the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment to these students.
However, please administer the Fluency Assessment to determine whether
practice and progress monitoring in the area of fluency are warranted in Grade 5.


The following chart provides an overview of how to interpret students’ scores.

Teacher Guide, making additional copies if needed. Benchmark results for
individual students are not included for the Grammar Assessment.


Begin to administer the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment, based on
students’ performance on the Reading Comprehension Assessment, and

~~**WORD READING IN ISOLATION ASSESSMENT (ONGOING)**~~


Begin to administer the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment individually
to all students who scored 10 or fewer on the Reading Comprehension
Assessment and to students who scored 11–13, as time permits, to gain
further insight as to possible weaknesses.


This section of the EOY Assessment assesses single-word reading to identify the
specific letter-sound correspondences a student may have not yet mastered.


**Administration Instructions**

  - Locate the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment on the next page of this
Teacher Guide. Students will read from this copy.


  - Cover all of the words before calling a student to complete the assessment.


  - Tell the student they will read words aloud to you and that it is important to
do their best reading.


  - Uncover the first row of words by moving the paper down.


  - As the student reads a word, mark any incorrect letter-sound correspondences
above the word on the Word Reading in Isolation Assessment Scoring Sheet
(Activity Page A.4 that you collected from students). Also, note whether the
student incorrectly chunks letters into syllables, leading to mispronunciation.
If the student reads the word correctly, place a check mark above the word.


  - If, after 10 seconds, the student is unable to read the word at all, simply
tell the student the word and move on. Mark an ‘X’ above the word on the
scoring sheet.


  - Administer the Fluency Assessment after completing this section and
continue administering these two individual assessments as time permits,
throughout Day 2 and Day 3, to the remaining students.

~~**TEKS 4.2.A.iii; TEKS 4.2.A.iv**~~


The more words a student is able to read and the farther the student is able
to progress in the assessment, the stronger their preparation is for Grade
5. A Word Reading in Isolation Analysis sheet and Remediation Guide are
located in this lesson.


The number of words read correctly indicates the following:


  - Students who score 43 or fewer words out of 65 correctly appear to have
**minimal preparation** for Grade 5.


  - Students who score 44–51 out of 65 words correctly appear to have
**adequate preparation** for Grade 5.


  - Students who score 52–65 out of 65 words correctly appear to have
**outstanding preparation** for Grade 5.


After scoring the assessment, you might find it helpful to determine which
letter-sound correspondences students missed that caused them to score
below the benchmark for word recognition. Note that one-syllable words are
not included in the Syllabication Analysis.

~~**FLUENCY ASSESSMENT (ONGOING)**~~ ~~**TEKS 4.4.A**~~


Begin to administer the Fluency Assessment individually to all students.


This section of the EOY Assessment assesses students’ fluency in reading,
using the selection “Paul Bunyan” (literary text) located on the next page of
this Teacher Guide.


**Administration Instructions**

 - Turn to the student copy of “Paul Bunyan” on the next page of this Teacher
Guide. Students will read from this copy.


 - Using the Recording Copy of “Paul Bunyan” (Activity Page A.5) for each student,
you will create a running record as you listen to each student read orally.


 - Explain that the student will read a selection aloud while you take some notes.
Encourage the student not to rush and to read at their regular pace.


 - Read the title of the selection aloud for the student, as the title is not part of
the assessment.


 - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the selection. As the
student reads aloud, make a running record on the Recording Copy of the
text using the following guidelines:


 - When one minute has elapsed, draw a vertical line on the Recording Copy to
mark the student’s place in the text at that point. Allow the student to finish
reading the selection aloud.


Unit 10 Novel Study, _Number the Stars_


**End-of-Year Fluency Assessment**

**Student Copy**

**Paul Bunyan**


Even as a baby, Paul Bunyan was mighty big. How big? Well, he was so big that his 18

parents had to use a covered wagon for his cradle. 28


As you might imagine, young Paul Bunyan had a big appetite. He gobbled up five 43

barrels of porridge a day, and his parents had to milk four dozen cows every morning and 60

evening just to keep his baby bottle filled. 68


Paul was so big it caused some problems in the little town in Maine where he grew 85

up. When he sneezed, he blew the birds from Maine to California. When he snored, the 101

neighbors ran out of their houses hollering, “Earthquake! Earthquake!” 110


After that, Paul’s father thought it might be better if Paul didn’t sleep in town. He built 127

a cot on a large raft for Paul and floated it off the coast. Paul slept on the raft for a few 149

nights, but the floating cot didn’t work out. When Paul turned over in his sleep, he created 166

gigantic waves that knocked down houses along the coast. 175


Eventually, Paul’s father decided that the East Coast was just too small for Paul 189

Bunyan. The only sensible thing to do was to move out West. So the Bunyan family 205

moved to Minnesota. In those days Minnesota was full of logging camps, sawmills, and 219

lumberjacks. Americans were moving west and “building the country.” They had to cut 232

down a lot of trees to make their homes, not to mention their schools, churches, boats, 248

and furniture. 250


**Word Count** : 250


End-of-Year Assessment
**181**


**182**




 - Assess the student’s comprehension of the selection by asking them to
respond orally to the following questions:


1. **Literal** What did Paul Bunyan’s parents have to do to keep his baby

bottle filled?


» milk four dozen cows every morning and evening


2. **Inferential** Why did Paul’s father think it would be better if Paul didn’t sleep

in town?


» When Paul snored, neighbors thought an earthquake was happening, so it would

be better if Paul didn’t sleep near neighbors and cause that kind of problem.


3. **Literal** What happened when Paul slept on a large raft?


» When he turned over in his sleep, he created gigantic waves that knocked down

houses along the coast.


4. **Inferential** Why was moving out West the best plan for the Bunyan family?


» Americans were moving west and building things as they moved so they would

have schools, churches, and furniture. All these new things were built because

they didn’t exist yet, which meant there was a lot of space out West. Paul needed a

lot of space.


 - Continue administering the Fluency Assessment as time permits, throughout
Day 2 and Day 3.


 - You may score the assessment later, provided you have kept running records
and marked the last word students read after one minute elapsed.


**Guidelines for Fluency Assessment Scoring**

 - Use one Fluency Assessment Scoring Sheet for each student taking the
assessment. The Fluency Assessment Scoring Sheet appears in each
student’s EOY Assessment Summary (Activity Page A.2).


To calculate a student’s Words Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.) score, use the
information you recorded on the Recording Copy and follow these steps. You
may wish to have a calculator available.


Unit 10 Novel Study, _Number the Stars_


1. Count Words Read in One Minute. This is the total number of words that the

student read or attempted to read in one minute. It includes words that the

student read correctly as well as words that the student read incorrectly.

Write the total in the box labeled Words Read in One Minute.


2. Count the Uncorrected Mistakes in One Minute. You noted these in

the running record. They include words read incorrectly, omissions,

substitutions, and words that you had to supply. Write the total in the

box labeled Uncorrected Mistakes in One Minute on the scoring sheet. (A

mistake that the student self-corrects is not counted as a mistake.)


3. Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes in One Minute from Words Read in One

Minute to get Words Correct. Write the number in the box labeled W.C.P.M.

Although the analysis does not include any words the student read correctly

(or incorrectly) after one minute, you may use this information from the

Recording Copy for anecdotal purposes.


As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider:


It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.
scores. However, a major goal of Grades 4 and 5 is to read with sufficient
fluency to ensure comprehension and independent reading of school
assignments in this and subsequent grade levels. A student’s W.C.P.M. score
can be compared with the score of other students in the class (or grade
level) and also with the national fluency norms obtained by Hasbrouck and
Tindal (2006). Hasbrouck and Tindal suggest that a score falling within 10
words above or below the 50th percentile should be interpreted as within
the normal, expected, and appropriate range for a student at that grade
level at that time of year. For example, if you administered the assessment
during the spring of Grade 4, and a student scored 113 W.C.P.M., you should
interpret this as within the normal, expected, and appropriate range for that
student.
