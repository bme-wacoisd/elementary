Dear Family Member,


In this unit, students will learn more in-depth information about the motivations behind
European exploration.

### **What’s the story?**

Students will learn about how those **motivations changed** over time and how the European
explorers and settlers **interacted** with the Native Americans who were already inhabiting
the continent.

### **What will my student learn?**

Students will learn details about the **voyages of Christopher Columbus**, the **conquistadors**
Juan Ponce de León, Hernando de Soto, Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, Cabeza de Vaca,
and the **explorers** John Cabot, Henry Hudson, and Samuel de Champlain. Students will
work on their **writing** over the course of the unit. They will start with **short opinion** writing
