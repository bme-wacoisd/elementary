**Grade 3 | Unit 8**
##### Introduction


~~**EARLY EXPLORATIONS OF NORTH AMERICA**~~


This introduction includes the necessary background information to teach the Early Explorations of

North America unit. This unit contains 14 daily lessons, plus two Pausing Point days that may be used

for differentiated instruction. Each lesson will require a total of 120 minutes. Lesson 14 contains the

Unit Assessment.


As noted, two days are intended to be used as Pausing Point days. These Pausing Points are

embedded into the instruction at appropriate points, with the first one after Lesson 7 and the second

after Lesson 13. You may choose to continue to the next lesson and schedule the first Pausing

Point day for another day in the unit sequence. Pausing Points can be used to focus on content

understanding, writing, spelling, grammar, morphology skills, or fluency.


~~**FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS**~~


**Reading**


The Reader for Unit 8, entitled _The Age of Exploration_, consists of selections that will further students’

understanding of the reasons for European exploration, what exploration was like, and who went

exploring. Aspects of navigation and life on a ship are described as well as the journeys of and

locations reached by specific explorers. This unit will describe the lasting contributions that were a

result of European exploration, as well as the impact it had on the Native American population, and will

also include information about the origin of some English words.


**Spelling**


During this unit’s spelling exercises, students will review words with spelling patterns of /ue/ spelled

‘u’, ‘u_e’, and ‘ue’ and spelling patterns of /oo/ spelled ‘oo’, ‘ew’, ‘o’, and ‘o_e’. Students will also review

the spelling patterns of /f/ spelled ‘f’, ‘ff’, ‘ph’, and ‘gh’. Students should be familiar with these spelling

alternatives as they were taught in Grade 2. Challenge Words have been assigned each week. Content

Words will continue. Each week, students will have the option of trying to spell a content-related word on

the spelling assessment. In this unit, the Content Words do not follow the spelling pattern for the week.


**Dictionary**


Students will also continue to practice dictionary skills. As the year progresses, students should

become proficient in interpreting the different pieces of information found in a dictionary entry, such

as pronunciation, part of speech, and various meanings. In this unit, students will practice using

sentence context to determine word meanings and then use a dictionary to see if the definition

matches the usage of the word in a sentence. Students will also write sentences to match specific


Introduction Early Explorations of North America
**1**


**2**



definitions. The dictionary worksheets have been designed to reinforce recognition of elements of

a dictionary and to build proficiency of dictionary skills. If you find that there is insufficient time to

complete every worksheet item, you may select fewer items for each student to complete.


**Grammar**


In grammar, students will be introduced to and practice the linking words _for example_, _in the same_

_way_, and _in contrast_ . Students will also be introduced to comparative and superlative adjectives

using the suffixes _–er_ and _–est_ as well as _more_ and _most_ . Students will also be introduced to irregular

comparative and superlative adjectives.


**Morphology**


During the morphology portion of the lessons, students will learn the prefixes _pro_ - and _anti_ - as well

as review these prefixes and the suffixes – _ish_, – _ness_, – _able_, and – _ible_ . Students will continue to apply

knowledge of how prefixes and suffixes change the meaning of root words and how adding affixes can

change the part of speech of words.


~~**WHY EARLY EXPLORATIONS OF NORTH AMERICA IS IMPORTANT**~~


This unit reviews what students have already learned about the early European exploration of North

America. Students will learn more in-depth information about the motivations behind European

exploration, how those motivations changed over time, and how the European explorers and settlers

interacted with the Native Americans already inhabiting the continent. Furthermore, students will

learn details about the voyages of Christopher Columbus; the conquistadors Juan Ponce de León,

Hernando de Soto, Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, and Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca; and the

explorers John Cabot, Henry Hudson, and Samuel de Champlain. Students will also learn the idiom

“touch and go.” The content students learn in this grade will serve as the basis for more in-depth study

in the later grades of European exploration and settlement of North America. For more information

about the quantitative and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the

Measures of Text Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


**Note:** This unit includes historical references to Native Americans that use the term “Indian.” There is

an explanation about how Columbus came to use this term, and also other references in some lessons

(Lesson 5, for example). The term “Native American” is typically used today instead of the term

“Indian”, as Columbus was inaccurate in thinking he was in India when he called the Native people he

encountered “Indians.”


While this is a history unit, there is mention of religion. The purpose of this unit is not to have a

conversation around religion, but it is mentioned with regard to missions and missionaries and their

role in this period of the history of North America. For more information on religious source material in

reading/language arts, consult the program guide.


Unit 8


The text that students will be reading and discussing in this unit provides opportunities for students to

build content knowledge and draw connections to social studies. You may build on class discussions

to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strand of Geography, History and

Social Studies Skills from the Social Studies TEKS. This content is not a replacement for grade-level

Social Studies instruction.


**Prior Knowledge**


Students who have received instruction in the program in Grades 1–2 will already have pertinent

background knowledge for this unit. For students who have not received prior instruction in the

program, introductory knowledge is addressed at the beginning of each unit.


Colonial and Native Americans (Kindergarten)


Early American Civilizations: Aztecs, Maya, Incas (Grade 1)


American Independence (Grade 1)


~~**WRITING**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


Students have many opportunities to write in a variety of ways and for different purposes. The formal

writing piece for Early Explorations of North America unit is opinion writing. The writing will develop

over the course of the unit, starting with short opinion writing selections and ending with a formal

writing selection. Additionally, the content of the unit is reinforced through a series of expedition logs

throughout the unit.


In Grade 3, students will write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive, leaving

appropriate spaces between words. In order to master these skills, encourage students to complete

activities in cursive throughout the unit.


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.

~~**PERFORMANCE TASK AND ASSESSMENTS**~~


The Primary Focus objectives in each lesson are carefully structured and sequenced throughout the

unit to help build student understanding. Additionally, formative assessments are provided to help

keep track of their progress toward objectives and standards. These can be found in the student

Activity Book and are referenced in every lesson.


The Early Explorations of North America unit will end with a unit assessment covering the

content of the unit, reading objectives taught throughout the unit, as well as a grammar and

morphology assessment.


~~**INSTRUCTIONAL COMPONENTS**~~


**Teacher Resources**


There are two Image Cards in your kit that include pictures to augment instruction of the Early

Explorations of North America unit.

first they will hear about explorers who sailed for Spain.

 - On a world map or globe, point to the areas known as the Americas: North

America, Central America, South America, and the islands in the West Indies

(the group of islands that separate the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea

from the Atlantic Ocean).

 - Ask students to define _voyage_ . Ask if anyone can name a person or people who

have taken a voyage across the Atlantic Ocean.


» Answers may include Christopher Columbus, the Pilgrims, European

immigrants, etc.

 - Tell students that they will learn about the many reasons Spaniards and other

Europeans explored areas with which they were not familiar. Tell students that

people from Spain are often referred to as Spaniards. Have students repeat

the word _Spaniard_ after you. Tell them that they will hear this word throughout

the unit.

 - Tell students that the readings and Read-Alouds they are going to read and

hear are nonfiction. Ask students, “Who can tell me what nonfiction is?” If

students have trouble remembering, remind them that nonfiction writing deals

with facts about real people and real events. Explain to students that even

though most of the information they are going to hear really happened, we

cannot know with certainty that all of the historical accounts that have been

passed down are completely accurate.


 - Explain that some events, such as the search for the fountain of youth and the

cities of gold, are described using language such as “according to legend” and

“as some historians believe.”


 - Tell students that historians are still learning more about history as new

discoveries continue to be made.

» Toscanelli’s map showed that if you sailed west from Europe, you would eventually

reach the Indies (Asia), but it did not show the Americas because Toscanelli did

not know they were there. So when Columbus and other European explorers

sailed west and arrived in the Americas, they thought they reached the Indies.

- With a small group, have students share a word for each spelling of the

/ue/ sound, say it out loud, and explain why that particular spelling is used

in each case.


- After each student shares a word, its spelling, and explanation, have students

give a thumbs up if they agree or a thumbs down if they disagree. Have

students who disagree explain their reasoning.


- While students are sharing, circulate and listen to their conversations. Provide

feedback when needed. For example: “One thing to remember is that in this

context, the word order should be ______.”


- Remind students of the previous spelling patterns they have learned such

as r-controlled vowels /ar/ and /or/ and how they can use those to help with

pronunciation of new words.


- Point to the Challenge Words on the board. Explain to students that the

Challenge Words, _impossible_ and _journal_, are also part of the spelling list and

are words used very often. The Challenge Words do not follow the spelling

patterns for this week and need to be memorized.


- Use the Challenge Words in sentences as examples for students: “It was nearly

impossible to get that grass stain out of my shirt.” “Do you keep a journal that

you write in daily?”


Unit 8


 - Remind students that this week, they again have a Content Word. Review with

them that the Content Word is a little harder than the other words. (If students

try to spell the Content Word on the assessment and do not get it right, they

will not be penalized. Simply correct it as you do the other words and applaud

their effort. There should not be a penalty for not trying or misspelling the

Content Word. The important thing is they tried something that was a stretch

for them academically.)


 - Tell students that the Content Word, _explorer_, does not follow the spelling

patterns for this week. _Explorer_ is a content-related word, as they are studying

explorers in the _Age of Exploration_ .

- Practice the words as follows during the remaining time: Call on a student

to read any word on the chart. Then have the student use the word in

a meaningful sentence. If students are unfamiliar with the meaning,

pronunciation, or syllabication of the word, have them utilize print or digital

resources to determine the meaning before sharing their sentence. After

the student says the sentence, have them ask the class: “Does the sentence

make sense?” If the class says yes, then the student puts a check mark in

front of the word and calls another student to come to the front and take

a turn. If the class says no, have the student try again or call on another

student to come to the front and use the word in a meaningful sentence. This

continues until all of the words are used or time has run out. Tell students

this table will remain on display until the assessment so that students may

refer to it during the week.

**Note:** Have students read the decodable passage “Sailors Needed!” with a

partner. Encourage students to practice decoding words featuring the /ue/

sound within the decodable text. Then, have partners dictate sentences to

each other which contain words featuring the /ue/ sound.


- Encourage students to apply the pattern when writing the sentence that their

partner dictated. Students should write in cursive. As students work, circulate

and monitor for pronunciation, spelling, and cursive writing. Provide feedback

as needed. For example: “One thing to remember about the spelling of mute

is that without the _e_ at the end, the _u_ would make the short vowel sound.”

~~**READ-ALOUD: “1492: A YEAR THAT CHANGED THE WORLD” (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U8.L2.1**
Christopher Columbus


Do any of you know what important

event in world history took place in

the year 1492?


In 1492, the Explorer Christopher

Columbus and other Europeans had known nothing about these

islands prior to his voyage. While Native Americans had lived in the

Americas for a long time, Europeans had no real knowledge of the

vast North and South American continents before Columbus. As a

result, people say that Columbus “discovered” the Americas and the

lands are called “The New World.”


In fourteen hundred ninety-two,


Columbus sailed the ocean blue.


Because Columbus and other Europeans had known nothing

about these islands prior to his voyage, sometimes people say that

Columbus “discovered” the Americas and the lands were called

the “The New World. That may be the perspective of Europeans

exploring, but the people who already lived here did not see the lands

as new, since Native Americans were already living in these lands.


- On a world map or globe, have a volunteer point to the areas known as the

Americas: North America, Central America, South America, and the islands in

the West Indies.


Columbus was actually looking for a different part of the world. Does

anyone know what lands Columbus was _trying_ to reach?


Christopher Columbus was trying to sail to a part of Asia known at

that time as “the Indies.” When Christopher Columbus and other


Unit 8


Europeans at that time talked about “the Indies,” they were thinking

about a part of the continent of Asia known today as India, as well as

many surrounding islands. He wanted to sail to the area known as

“the Indies” because he had heard and read that they were wealthy

lands, full of gold and spices, and he wanted to find a new route

there to bring respect and honor to his country. Columbus actually

journeyed to what is now called the Caribbean islands, or the West

Indies, even though Columbus was sure he had reached parts of Asia

that were called the East Indies. These lands are parts of Asia that

lay south of China and north of Australia. They include the present
day nations of India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines, as well

as some other parts of Asia. Spices like pepper, cinnamon, and cloves

were grown in the East Indies. Then they were carried to other parts of the

world by spice traders. The spice traders transported spices to Europe

by going through the Middle East.


Check for Understanding


Why do you think it was so important for Europeans to have spices?


» Spices were used for not only flavoring food but also for medicine,

special diets, and cleansing.


**Show Image U8.L2.2**
Pack Animals along Spice Road


It was a long and dangerous journey.

The traders had to load the spices

onto pack animals, like donkeys or

camels, and then lead these animals

across deserts and mountains, along dangerous roads where the

traders might be robbed or killed.


 - Point to the pack animals, the packs, and the robbers in the image.


 - Explain that it took a lot of time and money to transport spices to Europe—and

that meant that spices were very expensive.


Lesson 2 1492: A Year That Changed the World
**39**


In the 1400s, Europeans were looking for a better way to get to the

spice-producing lands known as the “Spice Islands” in the area they

called “the Indies.” They figured if they could find a way to sail there,

they could fill their ships with spices, sail home, sell the spices, and

get rich. The possibility of getting rich was certainly motivating,

but there were many other reasons, some that had nothing to do

with money. Many people in history have been driven by a desire to

explore, just for the sake of discovery. Many are driven by a desire

to share their religious faith with others. And many felt a sense of

honor and duty to represent their country in achieving things that

were great and challenging, like a new route to Asia. In the 1400s, few

things were as great and challenging as sailing into uncharted water

and exploring **uncharted** land. ~~Uncharted land and water are areas~~

~~that have not been charted, or mapped out yet.~~

Young Columbus Proposing Route


Christopher Columbus was only one

of many men thinking about “the

Indies” and the great challenge of

finding a way to sail there. Columbus

was born in the city of Genoa, Italy. In Italy, he was known as

Cristoforo Colombo. As a young man, he had worked as a sailor and

a mapmaker. He had sailed all around the Mediterranean Sea, along

the northwestern coast of Africa, and as far north as England. ~~Show~~

~~these areas on a world map or globe.~~


Columbus had also read the reports of Marco Polo, an Italian

merchant who had traveled to China almost 200 years earlier.


Columbus knew that the earth was a **sphere**, or shaped like a ball.

Most educated men of his day knew this. However, there were lots

of disagreements about how big the earth was. Most people thought

the earth was pretty big, but a few skeptics thought it was not all that

big. Columbus was one of the skeptics. He thought the earth was a

lot smaller than most people thought, and that led him to **propose**

Unit 8


his “ **Enterprise** of the Indies.” Everyone knew that “the Indies” were

“on the other side of the world.” But Columbus thought the earth

was small, so the “other side” might not be far away. It might even

be possible to get there by sailing around the world to the west. The

idea of sailing west, into the unknown, to land in the east. It had never

been done, and most thought anyone who attempted it would die.

That was Christopher Columbus’s bold idea that he proposed.


Based on the context of the sentence, who can tell me what _bold_ means?

**Show Image U8.L2.4**
Toscanelli’s Map Showing North America


Unfortunately, there were two big

problems with Columbus’s idea.


The first problem was that Columbus

was wrong about the size of the earth.

The earth was actually much larger than he thought—and that meant

that what was called the East Indies were much farther away from

Europe than he realized. ~~Point to Spain in the image. Then point to the~~

~~East Indies. Is Spain as close to the East Indies as Columbus thought?~~


The second problem was that there is something besides ocean

between Europe and Asia. There is a large block of land—the Americas.

Europe to believe in his vision of discovery. Eventually, Columbus

convinced the king and queen of Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella, to be

his **sponsors**, funding his voyage of sailing west to find what was

called the East Indies. Columbus set sail in August of 1492 with three

ships. Does anyone remember the names of the ships in his **fleet** ?

That’s right—the ~~_Niñ_~~ _a_ (/n *ny /), the _Pinta_, and the _Santa Maria_ .


Based on the context of the sentence and by looking at the image, who can tell

me what a fleet of ships is?


» a group of ships


Columbus sailed west for 5 weeks. After a while, the sailors started

to get worried and scared about how far they had sailed. Nobody had

ever sailed so far west from Europe. Then one day a sailor sighted

land. Columbus became excited. He thought he had reached Asia

and the East Indies. In fact, he had landed on one of the islands in the

Bahamas, off the coast of North America.


**Show Image U8.L2.6**
Columbus Claiming Lands for Spain


Columbus and his men explored the

island. Even though there were people

already inhabiting this land, they

staked a flag and claimed the island


the resources for their journey.


They made contact with the Native Americans who lived there, the

Taino (/tl*n ~~o~~ /), who were welcoming to them. Columbus called

the Taino people “Indians” because he thought he had sailed to an

island in or near the East Indies. The Native people traded with the

Europeans. Columbus and his men gave the Taino people beads and

bells. In return, the Taino people gave the Spaniards food, fresh water,

and colorful parrots. They each gave the other something that was


Unit 8


plentiful on their continent but rare on the other.


A few of the Taino had golden earrings or nose rings. Knowing the

gold would be valuable in Europe, Columbus and his men tried to find

out where the gold came from. The Taino and the Spaniards made

signs and gestures to communicate, because they did not speak the

same language. The Taino pointed to other islands. Long before

Columbus arrived trade occurred regularly between the people of

the different islands. Their gestures were hard to understand, but

the Spaniards thought the Taino people were saying that there were

places, not so far away, where gold could be found.


Columbus sailed off, looking for islands of gold and spices. He visited

several islands in the Caribbean Sea. On December 6, 1492, he began

exploring a big island he decided to name La Isla Hispaniola, or the

Island of Spain, for the empire that sponsored his journey. Columbus

and other European settlers gave new names to the land in the

Americas. These names were used for many years.

Two weeks later, on Christmas Day, the _Santa Maria_ got stuck on a

rock off the coast of Hispaniola. Columbus could not get the ship

afloat, so he told his men to use the wood and supplies from the ship

to build a fort on Hispaniola. Thirty-nine men volunteered to stay

behind at the fort when the time came for Columbus to sail back to

Spain to report his findings to the king and queen.

Columbus’s Return to Spain


On his return voyage to Spain, Columbus

brought some Natives with him to show

proof to the king and queen that he had

really reached “the Indies” and to help

the Natives learn Spanish so they could

become translators.


On the way back across the Atlantic, Columbus wrote a report for

the king and queen. He described having discovered and claimed

several islands in honor of Spain. Once he arrived in Spain, Columbus

presented Ferdinand and Isabella with the Natives and shared

many facts about the islands he had discovered. Columbus knew

his discovery was important, and he wanted to make sure Spain

continued to build off of his discovery.


He called the island of Hispaniola “a miracle,” describing it like heaven

on earth. He said it had good harbors, rich soil, lots of spices, and

rivers full of gold.


Columbus reported all of this in hopes of convincing the king and

queen to sponsor another voyage.


King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella were so pleased by his findings

that they decided to fund another voyage. This led to many more

European explorers traveling to the Americas in search of wealth.

1. **Literal.** Who were Columbus’s sponsors on his “Enterprise to the Indies”?

2. **Inferential.** How did Columbus first interact with the Taino he met on

the island?

Europeans.

that you will have them work with a partner to answer a discussion question.

Have students write their question and answer on a sheet of paper. Let

students know that in 5 minutes, we will come back together as a class for

each pair to share their answers.


4. **Evaluative.** Why was it important for Columbus to find a new route to what

was called the East Indies?


» Spice traders in Europe transported spices by going through the Middle East on

a long, dangerous journey. It took a lot of time to transport the spices through the

Middle East, and that made buying spices expensive. Columbus wanted to find a

new route to make trading spices and other Asian goods cheaper.


5. **Inferential.** Describe Columbus’s uncharted voyage and his landing.


» Columbus sailed in uncharted and unfamiliar waters for 5 weeks with a fleet of

three ships. His sailors grew nervous. One sailor spotted land. Columbus thought

he had reached the East Indies in Asia, when he had really reached the West Indies.

Columbus and his crew explored the island and staked a flag in honor of Spain.


6. **Evaluative.** How would you summarize the central ideas, or important

points, of today’s Read-Aloud?


» In the 1400s, many Europeans were looking for better ways to get to the Spice

Islands in Asia for spices and ways to make money and/or become famous.

Christopher Columbus proposed a faster route and convinced Spain to be

his sponsor. Because the earth was larger than he thought, and the unknown

Americas were in his path, Columbus arrived among the islands of the Caribbean,

which became known as the West Indies, instead of finding the Spice Islands, or

East Indies. Columbus was not the first to land on or inhabit the West Indies, and

he encountered several groups of Native Americans, including the Taino, whom

he called “Indians” because he thought he was near India. Columbus reported his

discovery back to Spain. King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella were pleased with the

reports and agreed to fund another voyage.

    - Instead of ending your complete sentence with a period, add a comma.


    - Add the words _for example_, followed by a comma.


    - Add the list of examples you wish to include, separating them with commas.


    - Add end punctuation.


 - Have the recorder for each team add the comma, the words _for example_, the

next comma, and the flavors the team chose to add to the first sentence.


 - Call on the recorders from several teams to read their sentences. (An example

could be: The ice cream parlor has a wide variety of flavors, for example, butter

~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Briefly review with the students the content they learned from the previous

Read-Aloud. To guide the review, you may wish to show any images from the

previous Read-Aloud, and/or ask the following questions:


 - Using Image Card C.U8.L3.2 (Routes of Exploration), have a student volunteer

trace Christopher Columbus’s voyage (brown dots) from Spain to the

Americas, which European explorers called the “New World.” As the student

traces the voyage, encourage him or her to name the places along the journey;

e.g., “Columbus started in Spain, traveled to the Canary Islands,” etc.


1. What area was Columbus hoping to reach?


» the East Indies


 - Have a student volunteer point to this area on Image Card C.U8.L3.1, or on a

world map or globe.


2. Why were so many Europeans eager to find a shorter route to what was

called the East Indies?


» the land route was long, dangerous, and costly


3. Where did Columbus end up landing?


» the West Indies or what is now the Bahamas in the Carribean


 - Have a student volunteer point to this area on Image Card C.U8.L3.1, or on a

world map or globe.

Check for Understanding


What year did Columbus sail to islands in the Caribbean, or the
West Indies?

» 1492


What was the name Christopher Columbus gave to the island he landed
on, claimed for Spain, and built a fort on?

» Hispaniola


 - Have a student volunteer point to the island of Hispaniola—the island that

today is comprised of Haiti and the Dominican Republic—on Image Card

C.U8.L3.1, or on a world map or globe.


 - Review the information covered thus far, highlighting the sequence of events.

Emphasize that, although Columbus and his crew were the first known Europeans

to sail to the islands of the Caribbean, he and his crew were not the first people to

arrive there; the Native Americans called the Taino were there before him.


**Note:** Students who used the program in Grade 2 will be familiar with some

of the information discussed below concerning the topic of slavery from the

unit, _The U.S. Civil War_ . Students also reviewed the concept of slavery within

the context of the Grade 3 unit, _Ancient Rome_ .


 - Remind students that throughout history, many different groups of people in

different areas of the world enslaved other people. They learned about this

practice in the Roman Empire. Explain that the Spanish Empire was similar

to that of the Roman Empire, in that the Spanish permitted slavery, and there

were many slaves in the Spanish Empire. They will hear about some of that in

today’s Read-Aloud.


 - Tell students that in today’s Read-Aloud, they will continue learning about

Christopher Columbus. Remind students that at the end of the previous Read
Aloud, they heard that King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain agreed to

fund another voyage as his sponsors. Ask students to predict what Columbus

would find on his second voyage. Tell students they will learn about his other

voyages, and what they would mean for other European explorers who would

come after him.

 - During the Read-Aloud, model appropriate accuracy and rate while reading.

~~**READ-ALOUD: “COLUMBUS AND THE CONQUISTADORS” (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U8.L3.1**
Map of Columbus’s Four Voyages


Christopher Columbus made four

voyages to the West Indies, convinced

he had reached the East Indies in Asia.

The voyage most people know about

is the first one, the voyage when Columbus landed in the West Indies.

In some ways, Columbus’s second voyage was even more important.

If you want to understand what happened in the Americas with

European exploration over the following hundred years or so after

Columbus, it helps to know something about his second voyage.


**Show Image U8.L3.2**
Columbus Preparing for Return Trip


When Columbus returned to Europe

after his first transatlantic voyage, he

was greeted as a hero.


Who remembers what _trans–_ means from the Light and Sound unit?


» across


So, what do you think _transatlantic_ means?


» across the Atlantic


Word of his expeditions spread rapidly in Spain and throughout Europe.

The report he sent to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain was

printed in large **quantities**, or amounts, using the recent invention of the

printing press. Thousands of Europeans read Columbus’s report, and

others heard the reports read aloud. Soon everybody was talking about


Lesson 3 Columbus and the Conquistadors
**65**

Explain that an admiral is

**66**



Columbus and his discoveries. Columbus was honored by King Ferdinand

and Queen Isabella. He was named “Admiral of the Ocean Sea,” and, as he

had hoped, he was given ships and money for a second voyage.


If Columbus had only gone to the New World in 1492, and there were

no subsequent expeditions, all of human history would be different.

There were many people at the time living both in the New World and in

the Old World, but they had no interactions with each other. Because

of Columbus’s first voyage, the two worlds met. But because of

Columbus’s work convincing all of Europe about the possibilities of the

New World, Columbus was able to sail again, and so were many others.


The second voyage Columbus took was a much, much bigger

operation than the first voyage. Columbus had a fleet of three ships

and about 100 men for his first voyage. On the second voyage, he had

a fleet of 17 ships and more than 1,000 men! When he was recruiting

sailors for his first voyage, Columbus had a hard time finding sailors

who were willing to sail west into uncharted waters. When he was

**recruiting** men for his second voyage, he had so many eager,

interested sailors that he had to turn many of them away.


**Show Image U8.L3.3**
Columbus Returning to Hispaniola


The ships of the second voyage left Spain

in September of 1493. After a stop in the

Canary Islands, off the coast of Africa,

Columbus and his men sailed west.


- Turn back to Digital Image **U8.L3.1** and point to the Canary Islands on the

map.



Unit 8


They sighted land in early November. Columbus explored the coasts

of several islands, but he was eager to get back to the fort he and 39

of his crew members had built on Hispaniola on his first voyage. He

hoped that, in his absence, the men he had left behind would have

developed peaceful trading relationships with the Taino and that they

would have collected a lot of gold. What Columbus actually found was

quite different: the fort had been burned to the ground; the Spaniards

he had left on the island were no longer there; and there was no great

hoard of collected gold.


**Show Image U8.L3.4**
Columbus and His Men


Columbus decided to build another

fort on Hispaniola and name it Isabella,

after the queen of Spain. He left his

brother Diego in charge of it and urged

him to find the gold that Columbus felt sure was on the island. Diego

and his men found some gold, but not much. By 1495, Columbus’s men

had become unhappy, and Columbus grew anxious. Some of them

sailed back to Spain.


 - Point to the men in the foreground of Digital Image **U8.L3.4**, and the men

leaving in the background.


**Show Image U8.L3.5**
Native Population as Enslaved People


Columbus continued to explore. He

left orders for the Spanish settlers

to treat the Taino people well. But

the situation got worse between

the Spaniards who were left to build

settlements and the Natives. The Spaniards eventually began to

enslave the Natives, forcing them to work to collect gold.


Lesson 3 Columbus and the Conquistadors
**67**


**68**



Check for Understanding


Who can tell me what _enslaved_ means?

» Enslaved people were considered the property of their owners;

they had to obey their owners and do difficult work for no pay.


In addition to this, many of the Taino became unintentionally infected

with diseases to which many of the Spaniards had become immune.

This was due to the fact that the Taino on Hispaniola had never

been exposed to germs that were common for Europeans. Over the

next several years, many of the Taino became sick, and hundreds of

thousands of them died of diseases, the most common of which was

smallpox.


Check for Understanding


Ask students to do a “thumbs-up” for true or “thumbs-down” for false to
the following statements:


     - Christopher Columbus made four voyages to the West Indies.
(thumbs-up)


     - Columbus’s men were very happy, and Columbus was relaxed.
(thumbs-down)


     - The Spaniards and the Tainos maintained a good relationship.
(thumbs-down)


**Show Image U8.L3.6**
Spanish Conquistadors


By 1496, it was clear that there

was no more gold to be found

on Hispaniola. Spanish settlers

began building large farms called

plantations, enslaving Natives to work them. The Spanish empire

was moving forward to take advantage of what Columbus had

discovered. After that point, the Spanish began to spread out,

exploring and **conquering** other nearby islands in the Caribbean.

The many men who led these voyages of exploration and conquest


Unit 8


were known as **conquistadors**, the Spanish word for “conquerors.”

These conquistadors were travelers, soldiers, religious missionaries,

and explorers from Spain who traveled to North, Central, and South

America to look for land and wealth, for adventure, to achieve great

things, and to spread the message of Christianity.


 - As you read the following paragraphs about the different conquistadors, point

to the corresponding areas on the map mentioned in the text.


**Show Image U8.L3.7**
Map of Conquistadors’ Voyages


By the year 1542, many Spanish

conquistadors had explored and

conquered most of South America, all

of Central America, and a significant

part of North America. The islands of the modern day Caribbean,

which were originally thought to be islands off the coast of Asia,

began to be referred to as the West Indies, to distinguish them

from the Spice Islands in Asia, or the East Indies. It was the Age of

Exploration, and many major explorations took place.


First, a conquistador named Juan Ponce de León (/wän*pons*da*l [-] a [-]

*on/) conquered the island of Puerto Rico to the east of the island [-]

of Hispaniola. At about the same time, another conquistador by the

name of Diego Velázquez conquered the island of Cuba, an island to

the west of Hispaniola. Soon the Spanish began to extend their control

beyond the islands of the Caribbean Sea. They began to explore and

conquer the mainland of North and South America. In 1513, Ponce de

León explored the coast of Florida and claimed it for Spain. In the very

same year, Vasco Núñez de Balboa fought his way through the jungles

of Panama and became the first Spaniard to reach the Pacific Ocean.

~~Point to Balboa’s route through Panama in the image.~~


A few years later, in 1519, Hernán Cortés led a Spanish army into

Mexico. He ordered that the fleet of ships be burned when he and


Lesson 3 Columbus and the Conquistadors
**69**


his crew landed so that everyone would understand there was no

turning back.


He marched his army inland and eventually conquered the mighty



Aztec Empire and its king, Moctezuma II (/mok*t



*zoo*m



/). The



**70**



conquistador Francisco Pizarro led his men deep into South America

and, by 1532, had conquered the other great empire of the Americas,

the Inca Empire, in Peru. In large part, the defeat of this great empire

was unintentionally due to disease. After coming into contact with

the Europeans, many, many Incas became sick and/or died from the

diseases Europeans unknowingly brought with them. The Incas did

not have immunity to these diseases.


Check for Understanding


Who can tell me what _immune_ means?


» protected from disease


So, the Inca caught European diseases just like the Taino. Why do you
think this led to their defeat?


» Because they were not protected from the diseases that the

Europeans unintentionally brought with them, they died of their

illnesses.


After helping Pizarro conquer the Inca Empire, the conquistador

Hernando de Soto turned his attention to North America. He landed

his troops on the west coast of Florida and led them on a long **trek**

through what is now the southeastern part of the United States. At

about the same time, Francisco Vasquez de Coronado led an army

of Spaniards north from Mexico into what is now the southwestern

United States, hoping to find the cities of gold he had heard about.


In the following Read-Alouds, you will learn about the journeys of

these conquistadors and other explorers and hear about their bold

ideas, their voyages, their struggles in search of gold, and their

interactions with the Native Americans.

~~**EXPEDITION LOG (15 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** To complete this recurring activity, you may wish to differentiate by

having some students work individually, with a partner, or with a small group.

You will need to save all of the students’ journal entries to be compiled into

a chart at the end of the unit. You may wish to have students refer to their

written responses to comprehension questions for this activity.


 - Explain to students that explorers wrote in journals, or logs, to help them

remember important information about their expedition. These journals

described the landscape of a certain area, the people they encountered, and

the resources they found on their travels. Tell students that some explorers

also sketched images of the places, people, and things they encountered.

Sometimes these logs would get printed and shared with the public upon their

return to their home country. Remind students that Columbus’s report to the

king and queen of Spain was printed on the newly invented printing press, and

because of that, word about his travels quickly spread throughout Europe,

encouraging the Age of Exploration.


 - Tell students that they will be creating an expedition log to help them

remember important information they learn in this unit. Tell students that

page 1 of the journal will be about Christopher Columbus and his voyages.


 - Have students use the information heard in the first two Read-Alouds and

the images from the Read-Alouds to help them remember details about

Christopher Columbus and answer the questions on Activity Page 3.1

independently.


 - After completing the activity page, have students draw a picture to illustrate

the information. After writing and drawing, have students share their journal

pages with a partner or with the class.

            -            pronounced /pro/, and the prefix _anti–_ can be pronounced /anti/, /ant /,

      or /ante/.




 - Have students discuss with their partner a word they’ve come across with a

prefix, and explore how that prefix alters the root word’s meaning.


 - Also, tell students that in previous units, they learned about root words

that were English words with prefixes and suffixes added to them. Provide

examples. (e.g., _unhealthy, nonstick, repaint, preview, actor, farmer, dangerous_ )


 - Then tell students that not all of the root words they will learn about in this

lesson are English root words.


**Prefix pro–**


 - Explain to students that _pro–_ means “forward” or “before.”


 - Tell students that words with the prefix _pro–_ can be nouns, verbs, or

adjectives. Students will have to examine how these words are used in

sentences to help them remember the part of speech.


**TEKS 3.2.A.v** Demonstrate and apply phonetic knowledge by decoding words using knowledge of prefixes; **TEKS 3.3.C** Identify the meaning of and use words with affixes such as im- (into), non-, dis-, in- (not, non), pre-, -ness, -y, and -ful.


Unit 8


 - Write the word _proactive_ on the board in cursive. Underline the prefix _pro–_ .


 - Ask students to identify and read the prefix, and then read the rest of the word.

( _pro–, active_ ) Then have students read the entire word, _proactive_ .


 - Ask students what _active_ means (relating to doing or behaving) and point out

that students learned this word in a previous unit. Also, point out that this is an

English root word.


 - Tell students that _proactive_ is an adjective and means “doing things before

something happens” or “preparing for what needs to be done.”


 - Share the following sentence with students to demonstrate the meaning of

_proactive_ : Dan was proactive in getting his homework done before his mother

asked him about it.


 - Next, write the word _proceed_ on the board in cursive. Ask students to identify

and read the prefix.


» _pro–_


 - Ask students what the prefix _pro–_ means again.


» forward or before


 - Have students read the entire word, _proceed_ .


 - Note for students that the word _proceed_ does not have an English root

word. ( _Ceed_ is not an English root; _Cedere_ is a Latin root meaning “go” or

“surrender.”)


 - Discuss the meaning of _proceed_ with students (to move forward). Point out

the part of speech (verb). Ask students what verbs are (action words).


 - Share the following sentence with students to demonstrate the meaning of

_proceed_ : We can proceed with our math homework since we finished our math

lesson.


 - Remind students that _proceed_ means “to move forward.” Ask students if they

have ever heard the phrase, _proceed with caution_ . Tell them that this phrase

means “move forward (or continue) with caution (carefully).”


 - Continue in this manner for the remaining _pro–_ words, using the following

chart as a guide.


**Note:** You will not write the information in the shaded columns on the board,

as that information is intended for use during oral instruction.


 - Note for students when words do not have an English root word, as

indicated in the chart. Also, note that the word _proposal_ relates to the word

_propose_ (verb).

**Prefix anti–**







**80**




 - Explain to students that _anti–_ means “against” or “opposite.”


 - Tell students that words with the prefix _anti–_ can be nouns or adjectives.

Students will have to examine how these words are used in sentences to help

them remember the part of speech.


 - Write the word _antifreeze_ on the board in cursive. Underline the prefix _anti–_ .


 - Ask students to identify and read the prefix, and then read the rest of the word.

( _anti–, freeze_ ) Then have students read the entire word, _antifreeze_ .


- Ask students what _freeze_ means (to turn from a liquid to a solid due to a low

temperature) and point out that this is an English root word.


 - Tell students that _antifreeze_ is a noun that means “a substance that works

against freezing.”


Unit 8


 - Share the following sentence with students to demonstrate the meaning of

_antifreeze_ : My mom put more antifreeze in the engine before trying to start the

truck, since it was the coldest day so far this winter.


 - Point out to students that antifreeze helps water in all different kinds of

engines to keep from freezing when temperatures are very, very cold;

_antifreeze_ works against freezing.


 - Next, write the word _antidote_ on the board in cursive. Ask students to identify

and read the prefix.


» _anti–_


 - Ask students what the prefix _anti–_ means again.


» against or opposite


 - Have students read the entire word, _antidote_ .


 - Note for students that while the word _dote_ is an English root word, its meaning

does not apply to the affixed word _antidote_ . So, in this case, the root word is

not an English root word. ( _Dote_ means “to lavish attention on,” which is not

related to the word _antidote_ .)


 - Discuss the meaning of _antidote_ with students (a substance that works

against poison or something bad). Point out the part of speech (noun).


 - Share the following sentence with students to demonstrate the meaning

of _antidote_ : The doctor had an antidote for the snakebite so Rob would

feel better.


 - Remind students that an _antidote_ is a substance that works against poison or

something bad; it works to prevent poison or something bad from spreading

(usually within the body).


 - Continue in this manner for the remaining _anti–_ words, using the following

chart as a guide.


 - Tell students to take a moment with their partner to come up with a list of at

least three words that contain the prefixes we’ve discussed. Circulate and

provide feedback as students come up with their lists.


**Note:** You will not write the information in the shaded columns on the board

as that information is intended for use during oral instruction.


 - Note for students when words do not have an English root word, as indicated

in the chart. Also, note that the word _anticlimactic_ relates to the word _climax_

(noun) and the word _antiperspirant_ relates to the word _perspire_ (verb). For

_antibodies_, note that even though the word _bodies_ is part of this word, the

meaning of bodies does not relate to the affixed word, much like with the

word _antidote_ .

~~**READ-ALOUD: “JUAN PONCE DE LEÓN” (15 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U8.L4.1**
Juan Ponce de León


In early 1493, Juan Ponce de León

                                  -                                   - (/wän*pons*da*la*on/) was uncertain

about his future. Trained as a knight,

he had spent a few years fighting

against the Moors in southern Spain.


In the 8th century (starting in the year 711), the Moors, who were

Muslims, crossed from North Africa to Europe and took over most of

the Iberian Peninsula, the land where Portugal and Spain are. They

ruled much of the Peninsula for more than 700 years. In 1492, Queen

Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain and their soldiers drove the

Moors off the Peninsula. Ponce de León, who served in the Spanish

military in that conflict, was not sure what he should do next.


That all changed in the spring of 1493, when Christopher Columbus

returned to Europe after his first transatlantic voyage. Word swept

across Spain that Columbus had discovered new islands, possibly


**TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text.


Unit 8


islands in Asia, and that these islands were filled with gold and spices.

As you have heard, Columbus wanted to claim more territories in

honor of Spain, so he organized another **expedition** to the Americas,

or what the Europeans called the “New World.” Thousands of men had

come from all over Spain to sign up for Columbus’s second voyage,

and Juan Ponce de León was one of them. Ponce de León set sail with

Columbus in September of 1493.


~~Point to Ponce de León in the image (the man wearing the helmet).~~


He was with Columbus when the explorer returned to the fort on

Hispaniola and found that it had been destroyed. Ponce de León

participated in the conquest of the land the Europeans called

Hispaniola and eventually settled on the island. ~~Have a student~~

~~volunteer locate Hispaniola on Image Card C.U8.L3.1, or on a world~~

~~map or globe.~~


Check for Understanding


Why did Columbus choose the name Hispaniola?

» He named it Hispaniola, claiming the island for Spain.


**Show Image U8.L4.2**
Governor Ponce de León


The Taino on Hispaniola were angered

by years of **mistreatment** by the

Spanish colonists, who had taken

away their land. In 1504, they rose

up against the Spanish colonists but were unsuccessful. Ponce de

León, who was a top Spanish military official on the island, played

an important part in stopping the uprising and, as a reward, was

given a piece of land on Hispaniola, appointed as the governor of

the island, and assigned a number of enslaved people to help him

cultivate a plantation.



Support


Explain that a plantation is
a large farm.



Sweet potatoes and a local crop called cassava (/k

the plantation, and pigs, cows, and horses were raised there as well.

The viceroy was the ruling
representative for the king

Ponce de León married a Spanish woman and brought her to live with

him on Hispaniola.

Ponce de León Searching for
Gold in Puerto Rico


By 1506, having helped maintain

control for the Spanish monarchy

in Hispaniola, Ponce de León had

established himself as a notable person on the island in the eyes of

the Spaniards. Ponce de León began to hear stories about another

island east of Hispaniola, an island that we now call Puerto Rico.

He had heard **intriguing** stories about gold on the island, and still

wanting more gold and land, he decided to explore it. Ponce de León

led an expedition to Puerto Rico in 1506. ~~Point to Puerto Rico on~~

~~Image Card C.U8.L3.1, or on a world map or globe.~~


Knowing that there were Natives already living on this land, he

brought with him a cousin who had learned the native language and

could serve as a translator.


Check for Understanding


What would a translator be expected to do?

» to translate, or change words from one language to another, so

that Natives and Spaniards could understand one another


Ponce de León met with the Native Taino of the island and signed

a treaty with a Taino chief that allowed him and other Spaniards to

hike across the island. To their great delight, they found several

large nuggets of gold in the rivers and streams. They also found an

excellent, well-sheltered harbor, which is now known as San Juan Bay.


Ponce de León went back to Puerto Rico a second time in 1508. Once

again, he struck a deal with one of the Taino tribal leaders, who supplied


Unit 8


him with workers. These men built a settlement near San Juan Bay and

cleared land for a plantation, while the Spaniards searched for gold. In

1509, Ponce de León was made governor of Puerto Rico.


Check for Understanding


Who can tell me what a governor is?

» a person who is the leader of the government of a state,

province, etc.


He encouraged Spanish settlement on the island and the search for

more gold.


In 1511, the Taino people of Puerto Rico rose up against the Spaniards,

and fought to gain back their land. Like in Hispaniola, the Spaniards were

better equipped than the Taino, fighting back with swords, guns, and

horses. The Taino uprising failed again. Juan Ponce de León once again

assumed his leadership was safe in Puerto Rico but political problems

arose. Diego Columbus, the son of Christopher Columbus, had gotten

himself appointed viceroy, in charge of Hispaniola. One of the first things

he did as viceroy was to remove Ponce de León from office.


**Show Image U8.L4.4**
Ponce de León Searching for Gold in
Florida


Ponce de León decided to explore

lands that would lie outside of the

territory governed by his enemy,

Diego Columbus. In 1512, Ponce de

León received King Ferdinand’s permission to look for a place that

the Native people called Bimini.


~~Point to the most western part of the islands of the Bahamas on a~~

~~world map or globe. The Bimini are islands that form the western~~

What do you think Juan Ponce de León was hoping to find in Bimini? If

**93**


**94**



you thought he was looking for gold, that’s a good idea! It shows that

you’ve been listening closely. The Spaniards were usually looking for

gold, and Juan Ponce de León was no exception.


However, tradition has it that Ponce de León may have been looking

for something else, as well. Some historians wrote stories after Ponce

de León’s death, saying that he was searching for a magical fountain

called the Fountain of Youth on the island of Bimini. According to

legend, an old man who bathed in the water of this fountain would

regain his youth. Some historians say that this story may have

intrigued Ponce de León, and that he set out to find the Fountain of

Youth. In March of 1513, Juan Ponce de León set sail from Puerto Rico.

On April 3rd, he and his crew sighted land. Ponce de León thought

it was an island, but in fact, it was a peninsula—a piece of land that

sticks out into the ocean and is surrounded by ocean on three sides.


Juan Ponce de León and his men went ashore and claimed the land in the

name of King Ferdinand. It was the spring season, which the Spanish call

_Pascua Florida_, or the Season of Flowers. The land itself was full of flowers,

so Ponce de León named this new land _La Florida_, or “the flowery place.”

That name stuck, and to this day the land is called Florida.

Map of Ponce de León’s Explorations
and Gulf Stream


Only a few documents from this voyage

have survived, so historians are not sure

about all of the details of his travels.


~~As you read the following sentences, point to Ponce de León’s route.~~


Ponce de León sailed north along the east coast of Florida, and after

some time, he turned south. About halfway down the eastern coast

of Florida, Ponce de León and his captains made an interesting

discovery. They discovered that, even though the wind was blowing

briskly and should have been pushing their ships southward, the ships


Unit 8


were actually moving north! Can any of you guess why the ships were

moving “backward,” even though the wind was pushing them forward?


Ponce de León and his men were sailing against a strong ocean

current. In fact, they had discovered one of the strongest and most

important currents in the Atlantic Ocean—the Gulf Stream.


~~Point to the area of the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean.~~


The Gulf Stream is like a river within the Atlantic Ocean. It is a

current of warm water that flows out of the Gulf of Mexico, around

Florida, along the southeastern coast of the United States, and then

northeast, all the way to northern Europe. Later explorers learned

that a good way to get back to Europe quickly was to sail into the Gulf

Stream and then ride the current back to Europe.


Ponce de León and his men found that they could avoid the Gulf

Stream by staying very close to shore. A few days after they

discovered the Gulf Stream, Ponce de León and his men tried to go

ashore on the peninsula, but they were fought off by Native people

and driven back to their ships. Ponce de León decided to continue

exploring the Florida coastline. He sailed south and rounded the tip

of Florida. He still thought he had discovered an island, and he was

trying to sail around it. He sailed along the string of islands known

today as the Florida Keys into the Gulf of Mexico. Then he turned

north and explored the western coast of Florida. He anchored for

a while along the coast, probably around the area now known as

Charlotte Harbor, but Ponce de León and his men were attacked

several times, so they didn’t stay too long.


Eventually, Ponce de León decided to return to Puerto Rico and

report on the lands he had discovered. On the way back, he and

his men visited islands off the coast of Florida that were home

to thousands of sea turtles. Ponce de León named these islands

Tortugas—the Spanish word for turtles.


Ponce de León went back to Spain to tell the king about his

discoveries. He was not able to return to Florida for several years. In

1521, he launched a second expedition focused on colonization. Ponce

Injured Ponce de León and Colonists
Retreating from Florida Colony


Ponce de León and his men landed

somewhere along the southwestern

coast of Florida. We don’t know where

exactly. They began setting up a colony, but after a few weeks they

were driven away by the Calusa people, Native Americans of the

region. In this particular battle, Ponce de León was wounded when an

arrow struck him in the thigh. The Spaniards gave up on their Florida

settlement and retreated to Cuba.


~~Point to Cuba on Image Card C.U8.L3.1, or on a world map or globe.~~


While in Cuba, Ponce de León’s wound became infected. He died in

July of 1521. Some years later, his remains were transferred to San

Unit 8


~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Briefly review with students the content they learned from the previous Read
Alouds. To guide the review, you may wish to ask the following questions:


1. What was the relationship like between the Spanish explorers and the Native

Americans?


» The relationship was not respectful. The explorers and the Native Americans

differed greatly.


2. What is the Spanish word for conqueror?


» conquistador


3. What is colonization?


» the process of developing a settlement in an area and taking control of the land

and the people who live there


4. Was Ponce de León’s colonization of Florida successful? Why or why not?


» It was not successful because as they were setting up their colony along the

southwestern coast of Florida, they were attacked by the Calusa Natives.


5. Who can locate on Image Card C.U8.L3.1, or on a map or globe, some of the

key places explored and visited by Juan Ponce de León?


 - Have student volunteers point to the following on Image Card C.U8.L3.1, or on

a world map or globe: the Caribbean Sea, the West Indies, Puerto Rico, Cuba,

the Florida coast, and the Gulf of Mexico.


 - Tell students that today they will be learning about a conquistador named

Hernando de Soto. Ask students if they can guess de Soto’s motivations for

traveling to North America.


 - Tell students that, before embarking on his own expedition, de Soto traveled to

the Americas with a fellow conquistador in South America, Francisco Pizarro.


 - Remind students that they briefly heard about these conquistadors in a previous

lesson. Pizarro conquered the Inca Empire that had developed in South America

by enslaving the Inca. Pizarro was easily able to conquer this population due

to the Inca being in the middle of a six year long civil war and then contracting

European diseases, which the Inca had no immunity. The Inca grew too weak to

defend themselves against Pizarro and his men. Tell students that the Inca ruled

over the lands that stretch along the Andes Mountains and the Pacific Ocean

(present-day countries of Bolivia, Ecuador, Argentina, Chile, and Peru).


 - Locate these areas on Image Card C.U8.L3.1, or on a world map or globe.


 - Pizarro’s conquest of the Incan civilization gave Spain the opportunity to claim

this very rich land as its own.

- Explain that just as Juan Ponce de León went on a voyage with Christopher

Columbus and learned from him before going on his own expedition, Hernando

de Soto traveled with Francisco Pizarro and learned from him. Ask students,

“How do you think Pizarro influenced de Soto?” Tell them to listen to find out.


- Tell students to listen carefully to learn about Hernando de Soto’s expedition

and his discoveries. Ask students to predict why de Soto went on an expedition

and where he went.


- During the Read-Aloud, model appropriate accuracy and rate while reading.

western coast of Florida. De Soto staked a flagpole into the sandy beach

and claimed the land for the king of Spain on behalf of the Spanish King

and Queen who had provided the resources for the journey.


 - Point to the flag in the image.


 - Explain that Hernando de Soto is being described as a veteran conquistador

because he has a lot of experience in conquering new territories.


De Soto was not the first Spaniard to explore Florida. Juan Ponce

de León had **explored** the area in 1513 and again in 1521, but he had

failed to **establish** a permanent Spanish colony in Florida. Another

Spaniard, Pánfilo de Narváez (pahn-fee-lo de nar-vay-uz), also tried

to **conquer** Florida in 1527 but did not succeed. Many of his men died

fighting with Natives; others died from dehydration, being lost at sea,

or drowning when a hurricane hit and sank their boats. In the end, of

the six hundred men who began the **voyage,** only four men managed

to get back to Mexico to tell the tale.


Why couldn’t the men drink water from the ocean?


» Ocean water has a lot of salt. People need freshwater, without salt, to survive.







**Student Reader pages 35–37**
Hernando de Soto Preparing for the
Expedition


Hernando de Soto knew about the

**explorations** of Ponce de León and

Narváez. He knew it would be dangerous









to explore Florida, but he felt he could achieve more than the men

who had **explored** before him. After all, de Soto had been in Peru with

Francisco Pizarro, one of the most successful of all the **conquistadors,**

when Pizarro captured and held for ransom the Inca Emperor, Atahualpa

(ah-tah-wal-pa). De Soto had helped collect the great ransom of silver

and gold that made Pizarro very rich.


And de Soto, too, became a very wealthy man through his relationship

with Pizarro. Hernando de Soto believed he could make even more

money by **conquering** Florida and gathering up the gold that was

rumored to be there. De Soto invested much of his own money in his

Florida **expedition**, and he prepared for it carefully. De Soto signed up

lots of other experts, including soldiers, sailors, tailors, shoemakers,

engineers, and priests.

Why did they start taking part in expeditions?


» to spread Christian beliefs in new lands


Most of the seven hundred men on his **expedition** were Spaniards, but

there were a number of recruits from other countries in Europe. The

**expedition** sailed from Spain in April of 1538. After a year in Cuba, de

Soto and his men sailed to Florida, arriving at the end of May in 1539.



**Student Reader pages 37–38**
Hernando de Soto Finding Ortiz at
de Soto’s Base Camp


De Soto sent a **scouting party**

inland and discovered an **abandoned**

Native village. Finding abandoned







Native villages was not unusual. By this time, many Native people

had learned about the arrival of Spaniards and many chiefs decided

that it would be best to avoid these strangers, so they **abandoned**

their villages. Sometimes, they would return to the village after the

Spaniards moved away.


De Soto and his men **established** a base in the **abandoned** village and

began to explore the surrounding land. They made a surprising discovery

on their **exploration** when they found a Spaniard who had been living

among Natives and had learned a little of their language. His name

was Juan Ortiz, and he had been a member of the **disastrous** Narváez

**expedition** . Ortiz had been in Florida for twelve years without any contact

from the Spanish. Ortiz’s life was spared by the Native Americans, and he

was allowed to live amongst them. The Spaniards listened to his stories

and decided to make Ortiz one of their **translators** .



Unit 8


Check for Understanding


True or False?
De Soto was the first Spaniard to explore Florida.

» False. De León and another Spaniard, Pánfilo de Narváez had a

decade or more earlier.


De Soto did not know about the explorations of de León and Narváez.

» False. He did know about their failure to conquer Florida, but he

was motivated by gold.



**Student Reader pages 38–39**
De Soto and His Men Marching Inland


De Soto left some men near the coast

and took some other men to **explore**

inland. He and his men made their way

through swamps and forests. They found













more deserted villages and helped themselves to whatever food and

supplies were left behind. Some Native Americans fought the Spanish

colonists. De Soto fought viciously, hoping that if the Natives heard how

dangerous the Spaniards were, they wouldn’t continue to fight.


By mid-September, de Soto and his men arrived at a village called

Napituca (na-puh-tue-kah). The local chief, Vitachuco (vee-ta-choo-ko),

seemed friendly, but Juan Ortiz told de Soto that this friendliness might be

an act. Ortiz had heard rumors that Vitachuco was plotting against de Soto.


De Soto decided to take no chances. He attacked the people of

the village and took Vitachuco prisoner. Vitachuco wasn’t treated

as poorly as other prisoners. He was allowed to keep some of his

servants and often ate with de Soto. De Soto thought that if he kept

the chief happy, Vitachuco and his people would cooperate with him.

This plan seemed to be working, until one night Vitachuco and his

people attacked, in an attempt to gain back control over their village.

The Spaniards eventually won this battle and killed Vitachuco.

Soto took as a prisoner told them of a city to the north in what is now

South Carolina, called Cofitachequi (co-fit-a-cheh-kwee), where the

chief was a woman who had lots of gold and pearls.


- Point to the area around Camden, South Carolina, northeast of Columbia,

South Carolina, on a U.S. map. Point to the Lady of Cofitachequi in the image

while you read the following sentence.


De Soto and his men went through what is now Georgia and into what is

now north-central South Carolina, in search of these treasures. There,

they met la Señora de Cofitachequi, the Lady of Cofitachequi. At first,

the Lady of Cofitachequi was friendly, allowing them to stay in her

village. She had very little gold, but she did have some pearls that she

gave to the Spaniards as gifts. Later, despite her generosity, de Soto

arrested the Lady of Cofitachequi, held her hostage, and marched on.


No one is sure what happened to the Lady of Cofitachequi, but some

historians say that she remained with de Soto and his men for a while

until she had a chance to escape through the woods. The Spaniards

could not track her down because they were **unfamiliar** with the

land. They never saw her again.

of the Blue Ridge Mountains. They passed through territory controlled

by the Mississippians.


Who can tell us what these three groups were called?


» Mound Builders


Everywhere they went they looked for gold but had very little success.

The de Soto **expedition** eventually reached the area now known as

Alabama. De Soto and his men were on a search for supplies, land, and

gold. On their quest, de Soto and his men were ambushed by the Native

Mississippians. This resulted in one of de Soto’s biggest battles. They

killed more than two thousand Native Mississippians. Only twenty-two

of de Soto’s men were killed, and two hundred were injured, including de

Soto himself. By November of 1540, the de Soto **expedition** had entered

into Mississippian territory in northeastern Mississippi. They spent

the winter in what they thought was an **abandoned** Native village.

However, the Native Mississippians attacked de Soto’s men by firing

flaming arrows. The Spaniards managed to escape with the help of their

stampeding horses, which scared off some of the Native people.





**Student Reader pages 42–43**
De Soto Crossing the Mississippi


With all of the constant marching and

fighting, de Soto’s men grew very tired

and were ready to go home. They no

longer believed that there was much



gold to be found in these parts of America. Some of them began to

plan a **mutiny** against de Soto. De Soto, however, did not want to

give up and go home empty-handed. He pushed his men on. They

marched and fought their way west.


In May of 1541, they reached the mighty Mississippi River. De Soto

and his men constructed flatboats to carry the men and horses, and

crossed the river at night to hide from the Natives.


Lesson 5 Hernando de Soto
**121**


After De Soto and his men crossed the Mississippi River, they

**explored** what is now Arkansas. They met Natives near what is now

Camden, Arkansas, who lived in tipis and hunted bison. De Soto and

his men spent the winter there.


- Have a volunteer point to the Mississippi River on a U.S. map.


By the spring of 1542, even de Soto was starting to lose faith and energy in

his quest for riches. De Soto had found almost no gold. He had lost many

of his men, and his horses could barely walk. His **translator**, Juan Ortiz,

had died, and the other **translators** were having trouble understanding the

local Natives.


Check for Understanding


Why did some of de Soto’s men rebel against him?

» Some of de Soto’s men rebelled against him because they were

sick of fighting and continuing to search for gold that they could

not find.









**Student Reader pages 44–45**
De Soto remembered


In May of 1542, de Soto came down

with a bad fever. He spent his days in

bed, but the fever got worse. He finally

died on May 21, 1542. According to



legend, de Soto’s men attached stones to his body and then sank it in

the Mississippi River, so that the Native Americans would not find it

and realize that de Soto had told them a lie about being immortal, or

able to live forever.


The remaining men of the de Soto expedition made their way back to

the Gulf of Mexico where they built seven boats. In July of 1543, they

floated along the Gulf Coast, past Texas, and eventually made their

way back to the Spanish outposts in Mexico. Throughout this difficult

journey, the men on the de Soto expedition were the first known

~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (15 MIN.)**~~


1. **Evaluative.** Were your predictions correct about why Hernando de Soto went

on an expedition and where he went? Why or why not?


» Answers may vary.


 - Assign the following questions as Think-Pair-Share questions. Tell students

that you will have them work with a partner to answer one discussion

question. Have students write their question and answer on a sheet of paper.

Let students know that in 5 minutes, we will come back together as a class for

each pair to share their answers.


2. **Literal.** Describe the interaction between Hernando de Soto and his men

and the Native Americans they encountered.


» By the time Hernando de Soto made it to Florida, the Natives had learned that

the arrival of Spaniards was usually not good news. Hernando de Soto and his

men sought to find gold, and believed it was their right to take over the Natives’

lands. Natives often fought with the Spaniards to try to defend their villages, but

de Soto’s men won, killing over 2,000 Native Americans in the most devastating

battle. De Soto’s men continued to conquer more lands, looking for gold that they

never found.


3. **Evaluative.** Why did many of de Soto’s men start to rebel against him and

why did de Soto continue in his exploration across America?


» Many of de Soto’s men rebelled because they had gotten tired of marching

and fighting, and they wanted to go home. However, de Soto and others were

motivated by the quest for gold and riches, and wanted to have a reputation of

being successful and powerful.


4. **Evaluative.** How would you describe the role Hernando de Soto played in

Colonial American history?


» Answers may vary, but may include that he and his men were the first known

Europeans to explore the southeastern United States north and west of present
day Florida. De Soto was probably one of the first Europeans to cross the

Mississippi River. De Soto searched for gold on a long journey in the Americas.

Along the way, he engaged in many battles with Native Americans.

~~**SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


**Unit 8, Lesson 5**


- Students are likely to write the incorrect form of /ue/:


   - For ‘u’, students may write ‘ue’ or ‘u_e’


   - F or ‘ue’, students may write ‘u’ or ‘u_e’


   - F or ‘u_e’, students may write ‘u’ or ‘ue’


- While any of the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should be

aware that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find it

helpful to record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the

analysis chart. For example:


   - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


   - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


   - Is the student consistently making errors on particular beginning

consonants?


   - Did the student write words for each feature correctly?


   - Also, examine the dictated sentences for errors in capitalization and

punctuation.

Unit 8



**142**


1. Keeping in mind that the goal of the Spanish was to conquer new lands, what

have they conquered in their explorations so far?


» Even though the conquistadors were searching for gold and found little to no

gold, they claimed a lot of land in honor of Spain and explored areas that many

Europeans had never before seen.


 - Tell students that in today’s Read-Aloud, they are going to hear about a friar

who traveled alongside two explorers of the Southwest. A friar is a man who is a

member of a Christian religious group similar to a priest, who goes out into the

world to teach others about his beliefs. As exploration continued and moved

westward on the North American continent, explorers often recruited priests and/

or friars to come along with them on their expeditions. Usually, the kings and

queens who sponsored the explorers or settlers encouraged the travelers to make

an effort to introduce the religion of Christianity to the Native Americans. Some

Spaniards believed that teaching the Native Americans about Christianity was

helping them, but it was also a way to help build a common belief system between

very different cultures. Tell students they will learn more about how Europeans

tried to influence many Native American ways of life in the next Read-Aloud.


 - Tell students that in today’s Read-Aloud, they are also going to hear about

Cabeza de Vaca, an explorer who discovered parts of Texas, and an explorer

named Francisco Vasquez de Coronado.


 - Explain that Coronado and his crew trekked approximately 4,000 miles in the

southwestern region of what is now the United States, searching for gold. It

was a long, hard, frustrating search.


2. What made Coronado think there was gold in this part of North America?


» Explain to students that they will learn more about this in the Read-Aloud, but one

important thing to remember is that Coronado believed there was even more gold

in this territory than in the Aztec Empire.


 - Explain that at the time Spanish conquistadors came to the Americas, the

southwestern region was a vast empire that was led by Moctezuma II (/mäk*t

*zoo*m /), emperor of the Aztec people. He lived in an immense palace in the

city of Tenochtitlan (/t *näch*t¯et*län/), the capital of the Aztec empire.


 - Tell students to listen carefully to find out why Francisco Vasquez de Coronado

may have thought there was gold in the southwest region of North America.


 - Before reading, ask students to make predictions about whether or not he will find

gold on his expedition. Ask students to support their predictions with reasons.


 - During the Read-Aloud, model appropriate rate and accuracy. Model using

the pronunciation guides in the text to pronounce words. At the end, ask

students what they noticed about your reading. ~~**[ TEKS 3.4 ]**~~


**TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text.

Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca tells of his
journey and of the golden cities


One day in 1536, Don Antonio de

Mendoza, viceroy of New Spain, sat in

his office in Mexico City, listening to a

fellow Spaniard, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, tell an astonishing tale.


- Point to Mendoza (seated) in the image.


Check for Understanding


Who can tell me what a viceroy is?

» a ruling representative for a king or queen


       - New Spain is now known as Mexico.


Cabeza de Vaca told Mendoza of his experiences on the disastrous

Narváez expedition. Cabeza de Vaca and the Narváez expedition

traveled through Texas, including Galveston to the Rio Grande Valley.


Check for Understanding


Who remembers what happened on the disastrous Narváez expedition?

» Exploring Florida, only four men out of 600 made it back to Mexico.


**Show Image U8.L6.2**
Cabeza de Vaca shipwrecked at Galveston


Cabeza de Vaca set off from Spain as

part of an expedition led by Pánfilo de

Narváez, who was hoping to explore

the lands between Florida and Mexico.


Unit 8


Unfortunately, Narváez misjudged the distance between the two.

He decided to land about three hundred men in Florida, hoping that

they could explore what he believed to be forty-five miles to Mexico.

However, they were really 1,500 miles away from their destination.

Without their ships and food, Narváez had his crew assemble rafts

that were meant to carry them across the Gulf of Mexico to the

closest Spanish settlement. The rafts left Florida in September 1528

and did well for about a month until strong winds separated the rafts.

One by one, they landed near Galveston Island in what is now Texas.


Unable to meet their basic needs, by spring 1529 only fifteen

survived. Twelve men chose to continue their journey to Mexico by

sea. Cabeza de Vaca was too sick to join them, and two other men

stayed with him. Stranded in a foreign land far from help and home,

Cabeza de Vaca and his two men faced a challenging journey ahead.

They would have to walk from the Gulf Coast of Texas all the way to

Spanish territories in Mexico. It seemed an impossible journey.


- Point to the line in the text that says “unable to meet their basic needs, by

spring 1529 only fifteen survived.” Ask students to infer the basic needs that

Cabeza de Vaca and his crew were missing when they were shipwrecked along

the Texan coast that would make it difficult to survive a long journey.


» They did not have food, blankets, or shelter. They had no knowledge of the land to

know which route to take or what plants and animals were safe. They also did not

have any mode of transportation that allowed them to move easily across the land.


**Show Image U8.L6.3**
Cabeza de Vaca’s journey


Cabeza de Vaca explained that

all hope would have been lost if it

wasn’t for help from the local Native

tribes. They guided him, shared their

knowledge of local plants and animals, and helped him to survive in

an unfamiliar land. For the next eight years, Cabeza de Vaca explored

the American Southwest, absorbing local tales and traditions and

deepening his bond with Native peoples. As word of Cabeza de Vaca

spread among the Native tribes, he was welcomed as a healer, or a

person who treats sicknesses, and a trader. By 1532 he was traveling

alone, without the original castaways, or men he was shipwrecked

with. When he finally reached his countrymen in 1536, he had

traveled over 2,400 miles, an astounding feat of perseverance. Along

the way, he gained knowledge of a land rich with resources that he

shared with Viceroy Mendoza. The report he wrote is sometimes

called the first written history of Texas. It was later used by explorers

to learn about the land and people in Texas.


- Tell students “Today, the Texas cities of Galveston, Corpus Christi, and

Brownsville are near where de Vaca walked.”


- Trace Cabeza de Vaca’s route on a political map of the United States, noting that

his route passed through modern-day Texas, New Mexico, and Mexico. Identify

landmarks along the way, such as Galveston Island and the Rio Grande River.


Check for Understanding


Why was Cabeza de Vaca’s exploration of Texas important?

» Cabeza de Vaca was one of the earliest Europeans to explore

Texas. He traveled for years through Texas and was able to tell

others about these journeys. His story inspired other explorers to

continue to explore and later settle in Texas.


**Show Image U8.L6.4**
Estéban Traveling


[Viceroy] Mendoza was fascinated by

this amazing tale of adventure and

survival in foreign lands. But the part

of the story that interested Mendoza

the most was the report Cabeza de Vaca gave concerning golden cities.

While they were living with the Native Americans, Cabeza de Vaca had

heard much talk about a land to the north of them, a land that was rich

in gold. This land was called the Seven Cities of Cibola. It was believed

that Cibola was a region to the north, containing seven wealthy cities,

each one bursting with gold. Mendoza was excited by this report and

was eager to find this gold.


Unit 8


Mendoza decided to find the Seven Cities of Cibola. He recruited a

French priest named Friar Marcos. In addition, a man named Estéban,

an enslaved man who had traveled with Cabeza de Vaca and who, along

with de Vaca, survived the Narváez expedition, was recruited to go

along as a guide and translator on their **investigative** travels north.


Estéban was a Moor who had been enslaved and relocated to Spain.

By the time Mendoza recruited him for the expedition to find the Seven

Cities of Cibola, he had become a very experienced explorer. Estéban

had come in contact with different Native American groups on his

travels and had learned a few things about their ways of life.


In the spring of 1539, these two men, along with a group of Native

Americans, set off to the north. They walked along trails that had been

**blazed**, or previously marked, by Native traders. Because Estéban knew

the land well and traveled at a much faster rate than Friar Marcos, and

Friar Marcos wanted to share Christianity with the Native Americans

along the way, the two men decided to split up. Together they came

up with a way for Estéban to get messages to Friar Marcos. If Estéban

found a good-sized city with some gold, he was supposed to send back

a small cross, about the size of a hand. If he found a big city with lots

of gold, he was supposed to send back a large cross, about the size of

an arm. If he found a huge city and a very large amount of gold, he was

supposed to send back an even larger cross.


**Show Image U8.L6.5**
Messengers Bringing Friar Marcos theNews about Estéban


After spending a few days scouting

the area, Estéban sent Friar Marcos a

cross the size of a man, indicating that

Estéban either knew or suspected the existence of large cities with

great quantities of gold.


- Point to the large cross in the image. What do you think this meant?

**148**



Friar Marcos was **stunned**, as he continued to follow Estéban’s path.

Friar Marcos followed Estéban’s footsteps for several days, until

messengers brought him disturbing news. The messengers told Friar

Marcos that Estéban had been killed in a pueblo called Hawikuh

(/hu*we*k¯ /), which was thought to be one of the cities of Cibola.

The area known as Hawikuh is in present-day New Mexico. Estéban

had presented himself to the Zuni of Hawikuh as a great medicine

man and healer. The village elders in the pueblo were suspicious of

Estéban and killed him.


- Remember, the Zuni were Native Americans who lived in the southwest region

of North America.


When Friar Marcos heard about what happened to Estéban, he decided

it wasn’t safe to go into Hawikuh because no one would know about

their discovery of gold. Friar Marcos went back to Mexico, having only

seen the town of Hawikuh from a distance. He told the Spaniards about

their journey and about the large cross Estéban sent back, indicating

the existence of large cities with great quantities of gold.


**Show Image U8.L6.6**
Spanish Assembling for the Expedition to
Cibola under Coronado


The Spaniards listened closely. They

asked Friar Marcos if he had seen the

golden cities of Cibola. Friar Marcos

said he had, leaving out that he had only

seen the cities from afar. He told the Spaniards that Hawikuh was bigger

and richer than Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire.


- Point to the word _believed_ in the text. Ask students to describe the slight

differences between these states of mind: _believe_, _know_, and _suspect_ .


When the Spaniards heard this, they believed that the city Estéban


Unit 8


and Friar Marcos had seen might be _El Dorado_ —the “golden one” they

had heard about from many Native peoples but had never been able

to find. Soon all the conquistadors in Mexico hoped for the chance

to explore and conquer this land of wealth. In the end, Mendoza

appointed a young man named Francisco Vasquez de Coronado to

lead an expedition to Cibola.


Almost five years after Cabeza de Vaca shared stories of his journeys,

in February of 1540, Coronado assembled his expedition in the town

of Compostela, in northern Mexico. Coronado wore bright, gilded

armor. He recruited 337 Spanish soldiers, 220 of whom rode on

horses. Also on the expedition were 700 Natives who would serve the

Spaniards and take care of large herds of sheep and cattle that would

be marching with the men. There were also priests and a few women

on this expedition. One of the priests was Friar Marcos. Everyone was

excited about what they would find in Cibola.


**Show Image U8.L6.7**
Coronado and Spaniards
approaching Zuni


Coronado and his men marched north

through the hot, dry lands of northern

Mexico, covering ten to fifteen miles a

day. When they came to rivers, they built makeshift rafts and used them

to ferry themselves and their animals across. They saw some small

pueblos, but seeing that the Native Americans had no gold, Coronado

and his men pressed on, crossing bush and desert and entering into what

is now the United States.


- Point to Zuni, New Mexico, due west from Albuquerque, on a U.S. map. Here is

Hawikuh, where Estéban had met his end. As Coronado and his men

approached, the Zuni came out to meet them. They were carrying

weapons and rocks, and they drew a line on the ground by sprinkling

cornmeal as a way of telling the Spaniards they were not to come any

farther. They were resolved, or determined, to protect their town.


One of the Spanish priests came forward and began reading a long

statement, while an interpreter tried to translate the message to

the Zuni. The message contained a long list of requirements for the

Natives, including that they were to accept the king of Spain as their

king. The Native Americans listened for some time, but it was not

clear if the message was interpreted correctly. Tensions grew. Soon

the Zuni grew impatient and began shooting arrows and tossing

stones. Coronado and his men charged.


The Zuni men ran back to their pueblos. They fired arrows and threw

rocks from the top of their pueblos built on hills and cliff sides for

protection. Coronado was hit by a big rock. Then a second rock

struck his helmet and knocked him off his horse. He lay on the

ground, unconscious, while his men carried on the battle.


**Show Image U8.L6.8**
Spaniards Exploring Zuni Pueblo


Coronado’s men did, in the end, win

the battle. They quickly discovered

that Hawikuh was not a vast city on

the same scale as Tenochtitlan. The

Zuni lived in pueblos, multi-story

houses made out of stone and plaster. The Zuni people who lived

there had no gold, no silver, and no valuable jewels. There were heavy

losses on both sides. The conquistadors were furious with Friar

Marcos for misleading them. What Estéban could have meant by

sending back a large cross remains unclear. Regardless, Coronado

did not give up hope. He sent men to explore the surrounding area.

After all, there were supposed to be seven cities in Cibola. He hoped



**150**



Unit 8


that some of the other cities would have more gold than Hawikuh.

Map of Coronado’s Exploration
in the Southwest


For the next few weeks, Coronado

and his men continued to explore

the region of Cibola. They found

many pueblo villages, but no gold.

Coronado decided to split his forces up. He sent scouting parties off

in several different directions. One party traveled northwest, through

Hopi territory in what is now northern Arizona. They went on until

they were stopped in their tracks by a massive canyon, more than a

mile deep. These men from the Coronado expedition became the first

known Europeans to see the Grand Canyon, which is now considered

to be one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World. Another party

traveled southwest, along the Colorado River, several hundred miles

downstream from the Grand Canyon. Today, this section of the river

forms the border between California and Arizona. A third party headed

east from Cibola, through eastern New Mexico. They visited the

Acoma pueblo, a pueblo that can still be visited today near present
day Albuquerque, New Mexico. This party crossed the Rio Grande, a

large river that runs south through New Mexico and forms part of the

present-day border between the United States and Mexico.

Plains, where great herds of bison roamed, or wandered. The Spaniards

were fascinated by the shaggy bison. At first they found it a difficult

animal to hunt. In time, however, they learned to hunt the animal with

spears, as the Native Americans did.


While the Spaniards were on the plains, admiring the bison, one of

their Native guides told them of a place far to the east called Quivira (/

k¯e*vir* /), a wealthy city. Hearing this, Coronado decided to march east,

hoping to find Quivira and the gold he had missed in Cibola. Coronado

and his men crossed into Texas, astonished as they took in the Great

Plains, where tens of thousands of bison grazed around them.


- Have a student volunteer point to where the state of Texas is on the map.


- From there, use your finger to trace Coronado’s route going eastward. This is

the direction the men traveled through what are now the states of Oklahoma

and Kansas.


- Remind students that the Apache Natives that Coronado encountered are an

important tribe in Texas today. (You may reinforce this idea by referring to the

shading on Image U8.L6.9).


Writing about his journey to the king, Coronado described the

plains known as Llano Estacado and the ravines of the Caprock

Escarpment along modern-day West Texas. While in Texas, they met

the Querechos (/k¯a*r¯a*ch¯os/), a migratory band of the Apache

Natives living in the Great Plains, who lived by following the bison

herds. The Apache Natives were an important tribe in Texas. These

Native Americans of the Great Plains were hunters of the bison. They

used the meat of the bison for food, in addition to the plants they

gathered. They used the skins to make clothing and shoes. They used

the bones of the bison, as well as stones, to make tools. Coronado

and his men learned a lot about the Querechos’ way of life, including

the fact that they had no gold. Coronado and his men decided to

move on, making their way through the High Plains region of Texas,

including modern-day Amarillo, along with Oklahoma, and Kansas.

Along the way, Coronado’s men continued to search each village they

encountered in their quest to find the Seven Cities of Cibola.

Coronado at Quivira


Finally, Coronado and his men reached

Quivira. Instead of a wealthy city, they

found a few Native villages and some

grass huts. Again, there was no gold.

He and his men decided to spend the winter near Quivira, before

beginning the long journey back to Mexico.


Coronado and his men, who had ridden forth on this expedition so

confidently with high hopes of finding gold, had no success in finding

wealth. He and his men limped back southward to Mexico with no gold.

In fact, Coronado had lost a large sum of money that he had invested in

the expedition.

farther away than they wanted, so they made rafts to travel the coast by sea. They

were shipwrecked in Galveston. There, Cabeza de Vaca left twelve of his crew and

lived with Native tribes. For eight years, he explored Texas while acting as a trader and

healer. When he made it to Mexico City, he told Mendoza about the land, its resources,

and the Native people who lived there. Then, de Vaca told the viceroy, Mendoza, of

the Seven Cities of Cibola. Mendoza sent Friar Marcos and Estéban on an expedition.

Estéban and Marcos separated. Estéban sent Marcos a sign that there was a large

amount of gold, but he ended up being killed before they met up again. Marco

returned to Mexico, claiming there was a city of gold. One year later, Coronado set off

on an expedition to find this city of gold. On Coronado’s long expedition, he and his

men traveled hundreds of miles through modern-day New Mexico, Texas, Kansas, and

Oklahoma. They came across the massive Grand Canyon and the Rio Grande River,

and saw the Great Plains with huge herds of bison. They had many encounters with

the Native Americans. In the end, the men of Coronado’s expedition never found gold.


 - Ask students to discuss the following question with a partner. You will circulate

and listen to their answers.

» Cabeza de Vaca kept a detailed record of the land and people of Texas. This helped

many explorers, including Francisco Vasquez de Coronado.

 - Use the following questions to promote a discussion:


1. **Inferential.** In his letter to the king, Coronado says, “The plains were full of

cows.” While cows are abundant in Texas today, Coronado was most likely

referring to another animal that was more important to the Native American

tribes. What animal were they actually?


» bison


2. **Literal.** What did Coronado observe about the Natives called “Querechos”?


» that they do not plant crops, but travel with the bison; that they eat bison and

make clothes from the bison skin, and also live in tents made of bison hide


3. **Literal.** What observation does Coronado share with the king about the land

in Quivira?


» that it is the best he’s seen for producing crops, and that it is well watered by

springs and rivers


4. **Evaluative.** Why do you think Coronado shares this information with the king?


» possibly to suggest that the Spaniards colonize the land to plant crops such as

prunes, grapes, mulberries, and nuts


5. **Evaluative.** Which parts of Coronado’s letter to the king do you think were

truthful and which do you think were not? Why?

- Point to the Challenge Words on the board. Explain to students that the

Challenge Words, _country, through_, and _threw_, are also part of the spelling list

and are words used very often. _Country_ does not follow the spelling patterns

for this week, and although _through_ makes the sound /oo/, the spelling

‘ough’ > /oo/ is so rare that it is not listed on the Individual Code Chart. The

Challenge Word _threw_ does follow the spelling pattern ‘ew’ > /oo/. These three

Challenge Words will need to be memorized.


- Explain to students that _through_ and _threw_ are homophones. Homophones

sound alike but have different meanings. Homophones may or may not be

spelled the same. Use the Challenge Words in sentences as examples for

students: “Many people have fought for their _country_ .” “Nancy walked _through_

the city and _threw_ a nickel into the large fountain.”


- Remind students that this week, they again have a Content Word. Review with

them that the Content Word is a little harder than the other words. (If students

try to spell the Content Word on the assessment and do not get it right, they

will not be penalized. Simply correct it as you do the other words and applaud

their effort. There should not be a penalty for not trying or misspelling the

Content Word. The important thing is they tried something that was a stretch

for them academically.)


- Tell students that the Content Word, _discovery_, does not follow the spelling

patterns for this week. _Discovery_ is a content-related word, as explorers hoped

to make a discovery when they traveled.


- Display the Spelling Table or project Digital Projection DP.U8.L6.1.

) **Spelling Table (DP.U8.L6.1.)**


- Ask students to refer to the spellings for /oo/ on **page 4** of the **Individual**

**Code Chart.** Point out that there are nine spellings for /oo/.


- Ask students which spelling is most frequently used. (‘oo’ > /oo/)


- Ask students to tell you which words to list under the ‘oo’ > /oo/ header.

Briefly explain the meaning of each word.


Unit 8


 - As you have done in previous lessons, ask students to tell you which words

to list under the remaining headers for /oo/. Briefly explain the meaning of

each word.

|kangaroo|shrewd||lose|
|balloon|newborn||movement|
|toothache|chewing||improve|

 - Practice the words as follows during the remaining time. Call on a student to

read any word on the chart. Then have the student use the word in a meaningful

sentence. After the student says the sentence, have them ask the class: “Does

the sentence make sense?” If the class says yes, then the student puts a check

mark in front of the word and calls on another student to come to the front and

take a turn. If the class says no, have the student try again or call on another

student to come to the front and use the word in a meaningful sentence. This

continues until all of the words are used or time has run out.


 - Tell students this table will remain on display until the assessment so that

students may refer to it during the week.


 - Tell students they will take home Activity Page 6.4 with this week’s spelling

words to share with a family member.


**Note:** Distribute the decodable passage, “Coronado Describes Hawikuh to the

King of Spain,” that you prepared in advance to practice decoding words with

/oo/ spelled ‘oo’, ‘ew’, ‘o’, and ‘o_e’. Have students read the text with a partner

to practice decoding words with the /oo/ spelling pattern. While students

read, circulate and provide corrective feedback as needed.

~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Show Image Card C.U8.L3.2 (Routes of Exploration). Have four separate

student volunteers trace the voyages of Christopher Columbus (brown dots),

Juan Ponce de León (purple dots), Hernando de Soto (yellow dots), and

Francisco Vasquez de Coronado (blue dots). As they do so, encourage the

students to name the places along the journeys.


 - Describe the interactions between the Spanish conquistadors and the Native

Americans.


1. Who remembers what we learned about de Soto and his expedition?


» They were the first Europeans to explore what is today the southeastern United

States, including Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, and

Arkansas. De Soto searched to find gold across many parts of the Americas, but failed

to find any. Along the way, he engaged in multiple battles with Native Americans.


2. Who remembers where Coronado explored and what we learned about his

expedition?


» Coronado and his men explored what is now the southwestern United States,

including Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. They were the

first known Europeans to see the Grand Canyon. Like de Soto, Coronado failed in

finding riches and gold he was looking for. Coronado also engaged in battles with

Native Americans, resulting in the deaths of many.


Lesson 7 Spanish Settlements

Challenge


Ask students to explain
the word _mission_ .




 - Tell students that in this Read-Aloud, they will be hearing about how explorers

changed their views about North America. Remind students that the early

European explorers were initially looking for a shorter and easier route to Asia.

Later, they were interested in exploring the lands for riches, but they intended

to return to their home countries.


 - Tell students that in today’s Read-Aloud, they will hear how the explorers

changed from these early phases to one in which they began to establish

settlements. Explain that this change in motivation occurred because

of changes taking place in Europe. Europe was overcrowded and lacking

resources. Settling in the Americas was a way to gain access to more space

and new resources.


 - Tell students that in this Read-Aloud, they will hear the word _mission_ .


 - Explain to students that a _mission_ is a type of settlement where people have

set up a community that they intend to be permanent to share their beliefs,

customs, and traditions with others. In today’s Read-Aloud, students will be

hearing about missions that were established in North America by the Spanish

explorers.


 - Remind students that earlier this year, in the _Native American Regions and_

_Cultures_ unit, they heard about Native American tribes that had established

settlements in various regions throughout North America. In today’s Read
Aloud, they will hear about Spanish settlements, or missions, that were

established on some of these same lands.


 - Tell students that they will learn about a change in the way Spaniards thought

about North America when, instead of just exploring and returning to Europe,

they started establishing missions. Ask students to predict why there was a

change in the way Spaniards viewed North America, and to listen carefully to

see if their predictions are correct.

and Coronado ended unsuccessfully, and while Coronado made it back

to Spain, he was discouraged after losing the large **investment** he made

in his expedition trying to find wealth. Instead, many Spanish explorers

began to focus their attention on the colonies they had already

established farther south in the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America.

However, they kept a close watch on their North American colonies by

building forts to protect their ships and settlers.


colonial governor of Florida, was an important influence in having

missionaries brought to North America. Menéndez insisted that any

ships coming from Spain must include a priest who could serve as

a missionary. The Spanish missionaries made many contributions

to American culture by sharing their faith with Spanish settlers and

Native Americans. They built many church buildings in early America,

also known as **missions**, that are some of the oldest buildings still

standing in the United States today.


Lesson 7 Spanish Settlements
**173**


**174**



Check for Understanding


You just heard two words: _missionaries_ and _missions_ . How are these words
related to one another?

» Missionaries were Spanish priests who traveled to America to start

missions to share their beliefs and ways of life with Native Americans.


**Show Image U8.L7.3:**
**Spanish missions**

In the 1590s, the Spaniards began

establishing missions in what is

known as the Southwest, including

the states we now call New Mexico,

Arizona, and Texas. Many American

cities in the Southwest began as missions. Some examples include

San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, and Santa Barbara in California

as well as San Antonio in Texas. Every mission was centered around

a church. Missionaries would often live in one building. The Native

Americans would live within the mission in their own houses. Most

missions also included **orchards** and farms where they raised

cattle, sheep, and other animals. Most missions also had bakeries,

craft shops, and storerooms for the crops grown on the farms and

orchards. The Native Americans that the Spaniards encountered

already had many skills of their own, including farming, hunting,

weaving, pottery making, and weather tracking. However, once Native

Americans lived in the missions, the Spanish taught them other skills

such as woodworking, soap making, and candle making.


In the missions, the Native people attended a school where they

received instruction from priests who taught about Spanish customs,

Catholicism, and the Bible. Adults and children were taught to

read, write, and speak in Spanish in an effort to **integrate** Native

Americans into Spanish culture, tradition, and faith. As time went

on, the younger generations began growing up immersed in Spanish

culture and adopted the language, style of clothing, and cultural

traditions taught to them by the missionaries.


Unit 8


**Show Image U8.L7.4:**
**Texas missions**

From 1682 to 1793, many missions were

**established** across Texas. However,

not all of them were successful in

establishing thriving communities. Many

Native American tribes in the southwest



were **nomadic**, which meant they often traveled with the seasons or to

follow food sources. This meant they weren't interested in settling down

on a permanent Spanish mission. However, there were many successful

missions in Texas, such as the ones established in San Antonio, Texas.

Does the Alamo ring a bell? The Alamo and four other missions built in

the 1700s still have an influence on the culture of the city. Mission San

Jose, Mission San Juan, Mission Espada, and Mission Concepción were all

built in the same area near the San Antonio River. These missions are the

largest number of Spanish missions in one spot in North America.


Spanish missionaries in San Antonio were successful in integrating

Native Americans into the mission community. The San Antonio

Missions consisted of multiple churches, **granaries**, workshops,

ranches, and fields with irrigation systems. By the 1700s, many Native

Americans in the area spoke Spanish and practiced Christianity.

Another success was Mission Espiritu Santo in Goliad, Texas, which

became the first large Texas cattle ranch. The cattle and crops raised

in the mission were used to trade with other missions in East Texas and

Louisiana.

church from logs and reeds. Ysleta became a community meeting

place because of its close location to the Rio Grande River. Ysleta was

unique because of how well the Spanish and Tigua Native Americans

were able to combine their cultures. Even today, it is known as the

oldest continuously occupied settlement in Texas.


**Show Image U8.L7.6:**
**The Father of the Lower**
**Rio Grande Valley**

Around the same time these

communities were being built, a

Spanish leader named José de

Escandón began founding towns and

missions along the Rio Grande Valley. Because of his large impact on

this area, he is known as the Father of the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

In 1746, Escandón was sent by the viceroy of Mexico (or New Spain)

to inspect the area between Tampico and the San Antonio River and

develop a plan to colonize it. He was made governor and captain

general of the colony Nuevo Santander. Under Escandón’s plan, he

had a budget for the community and five hundred pesos for each

colonist who agreed to move to these new towns. It was advertised in

many areas and attracted a number of colonists and allies. Escandón

brought in many **blacksmiths**, carpenters, and **artisans**, which helped

these communities succeed. Between 1748 and 1755, he founded over

twenty towns and missions across the area.

Unit 8


**Show Image U8.L9.7:**
**Photo of a mission today**

As the United States gained more

territory in North America, most of the

Spanish missions were abandoned.

However, a few of them still operate

today throughout Texas, New Mexico,



Arizona, and California. Many have been recognized as World Heritage

Sites, which means they have been designated as important cultural

landmarks. If you ever head to the Southwest, check out some of these

historical markers located in cities like El Paso, San Diego, and Tucson.

Americans living in their own houses within the mission; most missions included

farms and orchards; Natives were taught to grow crops like corn, wheat, and barley

using European farming techniques; some Natives were taught wood working, and

soap and candle making. Depending on the area, some missions also raised livestock,

including cattle and sheep, on cattle ranches located just outside the mission. Most

    - Sentence #2: The happy-go-lucky bird flew high over the treetops in search

of some sort of nibble, for example, a seed, a nut, or a tasty morsel of bread.

 - Ask students to vote for the more interesting sentence.


» Students should vote for Sentence #2.

 - Ask students why they think Sentence #2 is more interesting and informative.


» The sentence has adjectives, adverbs, and a list of examples.

 - Tell students that when writing, sentences should be long enough to be interesting

to readers. Interesting sentences also include descriptive words and phrases.

 - Remind students they have practiced writing, or building, more interesting

sentences by including adjectives, adverbs, and other interesting words in

 - Remind students that adjectives describe nouns, and adverbs describe verbs.

 - Write the following sentence on the board or chart paper, asking students

to read the sentence aloud and then identify the subject ( _kitten_ ) and

predicate ( _scratched_ ).


    - The kitten scratched.

 - Tell students that while this sentence is a complete sentence, it is not a very

by saying that you will show them how they can make a more interesting

sentence by adding adjectives and adverbs.

**TEKS 3.11.D** Edit drafts using standard English conventions, including (iv) adjectives, including their comparative and

Unit 8


- One way to make the sentence more interesting would be to add an adjective

or two to describe the kitten. Ask students to brainstorm words that could be

used to describe the kitten, prompting them to think of words to answer the

question, “What did the kitten look or sound like?” Write down the suggested

adjectives in a list in cursive on the board or chart paper. (Examples could

include _furry_, _sweet_, _black_, _shy_ )


- Another way to improve this sentence would be to add adverbs to describe

the verb. Ask students to brainstorm words that could be used to answer the

question. “How did the kitten scratch?” Write these adverbs in cursive in a

separate list. (Examples could include _nonstop_, _softly_, _noisily_ )


- Now ask students to brainstorm words that could be used to answer the

question, “When did the kitten scratch?” Write these adverbs and/or phrases

in cursive in a separate list. (e.g., _all morning_, _in the middle of the night_, _always_ )


- Now ask students to brainstorm words that could be used to answer the

question, “Where did the kitten scratch?” Write these adverbs and/or phrases

in cursive in a separate list. (e.g., _in the kitchen_, _outside_, _in the cat carrier_ )


- Remind students that a list of where the kitten scratched could be added to a

simple sentence. Remind students that the words _for example_ announce that a

list is coming.


- Finally, ask students to brainstorm words that could be used to create a list of

what the kitten scratched on. (e.g., _the new rug, the arms of Father’s chair, the_

_curtains in the living room, the bedspread_ )


- Remind students that, should a writer wish to add an additional sentence

instead of a list to serve as an example, the writer should end the original,

elaborated sentence with a period and begin a second sentence with the

words _For example_ .


- Dictate these two more interesting sentences to students and have them write

the sentences in cursive.


   - The furry, black kitten scratched nonstop on almost everything, for

example, the new rug and the curtains in the living room.


   - The shy kitten scratched in the house in the middle of the night on many

things. For example, she woke me up last night scratching loudly on my

bedspread!

**Grade 3 | Unit 8**
##### Pausing Point 1


Note to Teacher


This is the halfway mark of Early Explorations of North America. Your students

have now read and heard the first half of the readings about the European

exploration of North America. Students have studied what motivated

Europeans to explore and conquer new lands, have located some of the

uncharted territory that was explored early on, and have heard detailed

accounts of the expeditions of Columbus, Ponce de León, de Soto, Coronado,

and Cabeza de Vaca.


You may have students do any combination of the activities listed below.

The activities may be done in any order. You may wish to do one activity on

successive days. You may also choose to do an activity with the whole class or

with a small group of students who would benefit from the particular activity.


~~**CORE CONTENT OBJECTIVES UP TO THIS PAUSING POINT**~~


Students will:


 - Identify motivating factors that led to the exploration of the Americas in

different expeditions.


 - Explain why kings and queens in Europe were interested in exploring the

Atlantic and the area to the west of Europe.


 - Explain the significance of Christopher Columbus, Juan Ponce de León,

Hernando de Soto, and Francisco Vasquez de Coronado in the early Spanish

exploration of the Americas.


 - Locate on a map or globe key places explored and visited by the Spaniards (the

Caribbean Sea, the West Indies, the East Indies, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Cuba,

the Gulf of Mexico, the Mississippi River, the Grand Canyon, and the Rio Grande).


 - Describe the encounters between early explorers and Native Americans.


~~**IMAGE REVIEW**~~


Materials: Digital Images in the program's online materials


 - Show the images from any Read-Aloud again, and have students retell the

Read-Aloud using the images.

Routes of Exploration


Activity Pages
3.1, 4.1, 5.2 and 6.1



~~**ROUTES OF EXPLORATION**~~


Materials: Image Card C.U8.L3.2 (Routes of Exploration)


- Using Image Card C.U8.L3.2, have four separate student volunteers trace one

of the significant voyages of each of the explorers they have learned about

thus far. (Christopher Columbus, Juan Ponce de León, Hernando de Soto, and

Francisco Vasquez de Coronado)


- As the student traces the voyage, encourage them to name the places along

the journey.


~~**GUESS THE WORDS: CONQUISTADORS**~~


Materials: chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard


- Write the word C-O-N-Q-U-I-S-T-A-D-O-R-S on a piece of chart paper, a

chalkboard, or a whiteboard.


- Tell students that you are going to use all the letters in the word to form three

new words, and you are going to conquer the conquistador! (The three secret

words are _quit_, _soon_, and _cards_ .)


- On chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard, draw a blank line for each letter

of the first word; under that, draw a blank line for each letter of the second

word; and under that, draw a blank line for each letter of the third word.


- As students select the letters, you will fill them in where they go and cross

them out at the top.


- Each letter may be used only once. When the group has figured out the first

word, ask them, “Is part of the conquistador still there?” Direct them to

respond, “Yes, part of the conquistador is still here!”


- After they’ve figured out the second word, repeat the question and answer,

and once the conquistador is completely gone after the third word, you may all

say, “Goodbye, conquistador! We conquered you!”


~~**EXPEDITION LOG**~~


Materials: Activity Pages 3.1, 4.1, 5.2, and 6.1


- Allow students time to add any additional information or illustrations to their

expedition logs for the explorers they have learned about thus far.


Unit 8

~~**VENN DIAGRAM**~~


Materials: Activity Page PP.1


- Tell students that they will be creating a Venn diagram to compare and

contrast two things or people learned about thus far. Remind students that

to _compare_ means to “tell how things or people are similar,” and to _contrast_

means to “tell how things or people are different.”


   - Two of Christopher Columbus’s voyages


   - Queen Isabella and the Lady of Cofitachequi


   - Spain and the Americas, or what the explorers called the "New World"


   - Any two of the explorers or expeditions learned about thus far


~~**RIDDLES FOR CORE CONTENT**~~


- Ask students riddles such as the following to review core content:


   - We had lived for thousands of years on the island that Christopher

Columbus set his Spanish flag upon and named Hispaniola after his

sponsoring country, Spain. What Native American tribe are we? (the Taino)


   - Because the route through the Middle East was long and dangerous, the

people on this continent were looking for a better way to get to the East

Indies to obtain spices. What continent are these people from? (Europe)


   - We sponsored Christopher Columbus’s voyage to find a route to the East

Indies. Who are we? (King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain)


   - The news of my first voyage to what I thought was the East Indies became

widely known throughout Europe thanks to the recent invention of the

printing press. Who am I? (Christopher Columbus)


   - I am the “year that changed the world.” What year am I? (1492)


   - I was trained as a knight and spent years fighting against the Moors in

southern Spain; then I joined Columbus on his second voyage in 1493, and

later I may have gone searching for the mythical Fountain of Youth. Who

am I? (Juan Ponce de León)


   - I am the explorer who traded for pearls with the Lady of Cofitachequi,

took her and Vitachuco as prisoners, and crossed the Mississippi River.

Who am I? (Hernando de Soto)



Activity Page PP.1



Lesson 7 Spanish Settlements
**191**


**192**




   - I am the conquistador who Hernando de Soto helped to conquer the Inca

Empire in South America. The Inca, unintentionally, became sick with our

European diseases. I am considered one of the most successful of all the

conquistadors. Who am I? (Francisco Pizarro)


   - I am the Moor who, with Friar Marcos, was sent to find the Seven Cities of

Cibola, and who was killed by the Zunis. Who am I? (Estéban)


   - I am the explorer who went searching for the Seven Cities of Cibola after

Friar Marcos announced he had seen them. Who am I? (Francisco Vasquez

de Coronado)


~~**WRITING PROMPTS**~~


- Students may be given an additional writing prompt such as the following:


   - The most interesting thing I’ve learned thus far is because . . .


   - European kings and queens were interested in finding a route to the East

Indies because . . .


   - The Spaniards explored the Southwestern portion of what is now the

United States because . . .


   - Think about the text and reimagine what you have read from a character’s

point of view. Retell the plot from your chosen point of view.


   - Pretend you accompanied Ponce de León on his legendary search for the

Fountain of Youth. Tell about your adventures on this journey.

- Once students have finished writing, ask each group to come and place their

sticky notes under the heading “Christopher Columbus” as they read the

fact out loud to the class. Discard notes with duplicate information (or place

them on top of one another so students do not feel their ideas are being

thrown out).


- Tell students that in today’s Read-Aloud, they will learn about John Cabot, an

explorer who, like Columbus, was searching for a shorter route to Asia. Unlike

Columbus, however, Cabot thought he could travel to Asia using a shorter

route than Columbus used.


Unit 8


Explain to students that Cabot used his knowledge of the shape of the earth,

and lines of latitude and longitude, to find a shorter route. Write the words

_latitude_ and _longitude_ on a piece of chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard.

Use Image Card C.U8.L3.1, or a world map or globe, to demonstrate these

terms. Ask students to identify the shape of the earth.



Challenge


Ask for three student
volunteers to locate Italy,
Spain, and England on
Poster 1, or on a world
map or globe.


Challenge


Who can tell me what a
merchant is?




- Ask students if they remember what _latitude_ means. Guide the discussion until

students understand that the lines of latitude are the imaginary lines drawn

horizontally on the globe that helped explorers stay on course, or continue in

the direction they wanted to sail. Ask students if they remember the name of

the line of latitude that is located at the widest part of the earth, or around the

middle. (the equator)


- Ask students if they remember what _longitude_ means, and ask them what word

they notice within it. (long) Guide the discussion until they understand that

lines of longitude are the imaginary long lines that run north to south around

the globe. Show students on a world map or globe how the lines of latitude

are “flat” and evenly spaced from one to another, but ask students what they

notice about the lines of longitude. Guide the discussion until students realize

that the lines of longitude are closer together near the poles of the earth and

spaced farther apart near the equator. Explain to students that sailors use lines

of latitude to determine how far north or south they are from the equator; they

use longitude to tell how far east or west they are from the Prime Meridian.

Show students the Prime Meridian and explain that the Prime Meridian is the

first line of longitude, and it goes through Greenwich, England.


- Repeat that longitude is “long” and latitude is “flat.” It may also be helpful to

mention that lines of _lat_ itude run horizontally like the rungs of a _lad_ der.


- Write the Purpose for Listening on the board or chart paper, or project Digital

Projection DP.U8.L8.1 for students’ reference throughout the lesson. Read

the questions aloud in a choral read with the class before moving on to the

Read-Aloud.

~~**READ-ALOUD: “JOHN CABOT” (30 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U8.L8.1**
John Cabot as a Young Sailor
Learning to Navigate


Earlier you learned about Christopher

Columbus, an Italian explorer who

sailed to represent Spain’s interests.

Today you will learn about John Cabot, another Italian explorer, who

sailed to represent England’s interests.


We know very little about the early years of Cabot’s life. Historians

believe that he was born in Genoa, Italy, the same birthplace of

Christopher Columbus. He was also born about the same time as

Columbus. In his early years, John Cabot was known by his Italian name,

         - –          -          -          Giovanni Caboto (/je*o*von*e kä*bo*to/). He lived for many years in

the Italian city of Venice where he worked as a merchant and a sailor.


His work in Venice led him to travel along the coasts of countries

in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, where he further developed his

**navigational** skills. As a merchant, he began to think that he could

obtain spices more quickly and cheaply by finding a westward water

route that would take him to the East. In 1493, Cabot and many

Europeans learned that Christopher Columbus had an idea very

similar to Cabot’s: finding a water route to Asia by traveling west.

After several years in Venice, Cabot relocated to Bristol, England, in

1495. Shortly thereafter, Cabot took steps to **embark** on a voyage of

his own, but one that was slightly different from Columbus’s.


**Show Image U8.L8.2**
Globe Showing Cabot’s Intended Route


Cabot had a simple idea. He knew

the earth was spherical, and he

knew that one of the properties of a

sphere is that the distance around


Unit 8


it is greatest in the middle, or at its **circumference**, and less on

the top or bottom. If you apply this basic **geometry** to the earth, it

means that the circumference of the earth is greatest at the equator

and is significantly less north or south of the equator. Think about a

basketball. The circumference of a basketball, or the distance around it

if you measure in the very middle, is 30 inches. The distance around the

same ball if you measure at a point closer to the top is only 15 inches.


Cabot thought Columbus had made a strategic mistake in his

attempts to sail to what was called the East Indies. Columbus

had sailed in the middle latitudes, close to the equator, where the

distances would be longest. Cabot thought he could get to the

East Indies faster by sailing at a more northerly latitude, where the

distances would be shorter. He proposed heading north, hoping to

find a “Northwest Passage” to Asia and the East Indies.


**Show Image U8.L8.3**
Cabot in England


Cabot tried to find sponsors and

investors to support his voyage to find

the Northwest Passage. In 1496, Henry

VII, the king of England, decided to

sponsor Cabot. Merchants in Bristol helped support the voyage as well.

Henry VII gave Cabot permission to explore and claim unknown lands

for England. Cabot was also encouraged to bring any **merchandise**

he acquired back to Bristol, England. Cabot was told he would enjoy a

great share of the trade **profits** if the voyage were successful.


 - Have students take out Activity Page 8.1.


 - Break the class into three groups and assign each group two bolded vocabulary

words from the passage: _navigational_ and _embark, circumference_ and _geometry,_

_merchandise_ and _profits_ . Ask students to work together to use the context clues in

the sentence(s) surrounding the term they were assigned to determine its meaning.

Then they should use the glossary to check whether or not they were correct. Make

sure students have Activity Page 8.1 to complete this activity. ~~**TEKS 3.3.B**~~


**TEKS 3.3.B** Use context within and beyond a sentence to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words and multiple-meaning
words.

- Model this process with the term _commodity_ : This discovery made King

Henry VII very happy because, at the time of Cabot’s voyage, fish was a very

**Show Image U8.L8.4**
Map of Cabot’s First and Second Journeys


Cabot attempted three voyages

across the Atlantic. The first voyage

attempt from Bristol, England, was

not a success. Cabot and his men


Cabot had some disagreements with his crew regarding his route.

With all the misfortunes that took place at the onset of the voyage,

Cabot eventually decided to turn around and sail back to Bristol.


Cabot’s second voyage was more successful. Again, he had only one

ship. It was a small ship, called the _Matthew_, with a crew of just 18

men. Cabot and his men set sail from Bristol in May of 1497. They

sailed past Ireland and across the Atlantic. On June 24, they sighted

land. Historians think Cabot made landfall somewhere in the area of

southern Labrador, Newfoundland, or Cape Breton Island in present
day Canada, but the exact location is not known for certain.


**Show Image U8.L8.5**
Cabot on His Ship off the Coast
of North America


Cabot did not spend much time

on land. It appears that he and his

men got off the ship only once and

did not wander inland more than a few hundred feet. They did not

encounter any Native Americans but found signs of their settlement.

Cabot claimed the land for England, collected some fresh water, and

got back on board his ship. Cabot and his men spent time exploring

the coast of the area now known as the Cabot Strait—a channel

60 miles wide between northern Cape Breton Island and southwestern

Newfoundland. On their exploration of the coast, Cabot and his crew


Unit 8


discovered some very good fishing grounds. As far as we know, Cabot

was the first European to set foot in this part of North America since

the Vikings had around the year 1000 AD.


**Show Image U8.L8.6**
Henry VII


Cabot returned to England and went

to visit King Henry VII, certain that

he had explored the northeast coast

of Asia. He reported to the king that

he discovered wonderful land in a place with a good climate. He

mentioned the superb fishing grounds of which England could make

great use. This discovery made King Henry VII very happy because, at

the time of Cabot’s voyage, fish was a very expensive **commodity** .


**Show Image U8.L8.7**
Map of Final Journey


Seeing that his discoveries were

welcomed, Cabot decided to return

to the land he explored and sail until

he reached another land in Asia full

of spices and riches: the land that today is called Japan. In February

1498, he received permission from King Henry VII to embark on another

voyage. Very little is known of this third voyage. Historians don’t know

for sure, but this voyage likely involved around 200 men and maybe

five ships. Unfortunately, when Cabot and his expedition set off, one of

his ships became damaged, and the whole fleet had to stop in Ireland

due to severe storms. Cabot was supposedly not heard from again, and

some historians think he even died on that voyage. Other historians

think that he returned from his voyage and lived in London for a short

time until approximately 1500 AD. There is little evidence about this

voyage or the whereabouts of Cabot after the voyage, so historians

can’t really be sure of its outcome.

Columbus in many ways.


Both men were born in Genoa, Italy.

Both men convinced foreign kings

to sponsor their explorations. Both men attempted to sail to the

East Indies and ended up finding something else altogether. Cabot’s

explorations proved very important for England. His attempts to

find a Northwest Passage to the East Indies failed, but finding and

claiming land on the continent of North America was essential for

England to later establish British colonies.


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


- Call on a few students to read over the sticky notes they placed under the

“Christopher Columbus” heading in the graphic organizer. Ask the class

whether they would like to move any of the facts now that they have read

about John Cabot. Allow for discussion and movement. Place students back

into their groups from the prereading activity on Christopher Columbus.

Distribute sticky notes to the groups once more. Ask students to work

together and use the text to write facts about John Cabot and/or Christopher

Columbus that could go under the “Both” and/or “John Cabot” headings of the

graphic organizer.

Unit 8






~~**SMALL GROUP/PARTNER READING: “JOHN CABOT” (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Split the class into two groups. One group will read through the chapter in a

small cluster with the teacher’s support and assistance. The second group will

whisper read to a partner. Both groups will work their way through the chapter

taking turns reading by switching after each paragraph. Those who are not

actively reading aloud will follow along by using their finger or a pointer to scan

over the text as their partner/group member reads it aloud.


 - Small group: Listen to students as they read aloud from the text. This is an

opportunity to take anecdotal notes on students’ fluency and prosody. Assist

students in sounding out difficult words and rereading sentences with which

they struggle. The purpose of today’s reading is for students to practice

reading for fluency and become familiar with the chapter in order to prepare

for the purposeful re-reading in Lesson 9. If students have comprehension
related questions, ask them to write the questions on a sticky note and place it

in the Reader over the part of the text that causes them confusion.


**Note:** Return to Discussion and Wrap-Up questions in Lesson 9 as a

Wrap-Up activity.

Lesson 8 John Cabot, Part I

**212**



Unit 8


**Hardtack** was a kind of bread that was baked over
and over. **Hardtack** was so hard, it was tough to eat.
Sailors had to soak it in a drink to soften it up. The
good thing about **hardtack**, though, was that it would
not **spoil** on a long **voyage** . It was so hard, bugs had
trouble getting into it—unless it got wet. Once it got
wet, weevils and other bugs could and did get into it.
But you could usually see them and brush them off with
your fingers.


If a **voyage** was going well, sailors might get other
kinds of food. They might get a little salted meat now
and then. They might get some fish or a few beans. But
if supplies were running low, they might get nothing
but **hardtack** .


The diet on sailing ships was so bad that many
sailors got sick. Lots of them got a disease called **scurvy** .
Today, we know now that **scurvy** is caused by a lack of
vitamin C, found in fresh fruits and vegetables. In the
Age of **Exploration**, people did not know this. So many
sailors died.

Lesson 8 John Cabot, Part I
**213**


**214**



After a long day of work, sailors were ready to fall
into bed and rest their aching bones. They were ready—
but there were no beds for them to fall into. The captain
had a bed to sleep in, but the sailors did not. They slept
on the deck. As the ship rolled back and forth with the
waves, the sailors rolled with it.


Most sailors had to stand **watch** for part of the night.
When that was done, they could sleep for a few hours. In
the morning, they would get up and do it all over again.
A sailor’s day started bright and early.


So, what do you think? Does a sailor’s life sound
good to you?

reading and read it aloud to their partner. Next, ask students to reflect on

whether or not their prediction was accurate and share this with their partner

as well. As they participate in this discussion, students should use the

following sentence frames that you may write on the board or on chart paper:

 - Remind students that adjectives are descriptive words that describe nouns

or pronouns.


 - Tell students that sometimes adjectives are used to compare nouns.


 - Ask students to fill in the blank in the following sentence:


    - If Fred is 9 years old and Sam is 8 years old, Fred is than Sam.


    - Say, “If you filled in the blank with the word _older_, you are correct.”

the other. Comparative adjectives are formed by adding the suffix – _er_ to

an adjective. The word _old_ becomes _older_ .


    - Ask students to fill in the blank in the following sentence:


    - If Sally is 10 years old, Fred is 9 years old, and Sam is 8 years old, Sally is

the ___ child of the three.


 - Say, “If you filled in this blank with the word _oldest_, you are correct.”


 - Tell students that the word _oldest_ is called a superlative adjective because

it compares more than two nouns by showing that one noun is the most or

greatest. Superlative adjectives are formed by adding the suffix – _est_ to the

adjective. The word _old_ becomes _oldest_ .


 - Have students fill in the blanks with forms of the word _tall_ :


    - My brother is  . ( _tall_ )


    - My mother is than my brother. ( _taller_ )


    - My father is the one in the family. ( _tallest_ )


 - Point out for students that when comparing two people (my brother and

mother), the suffix – _er_ was added to the word _tall_, and when comparing more

than two people (my brother, mother, and father), the suffix – _est_ was added to

the word _tall_ .


 - Ask students to name adjectives that end with the letter ‘e’. (e.g., _safe, wise,_

_large, cute_ )


 - Tell students that in order to add the suffixes – _er_ or – _est_ to an adjective

that ends with the letter ‘e’, the ‘e’ is dropped before adding the suffix. ( _safe_

becomes _safer_ or _safest_ ; _wise_ becomes _wiser_ or _wisest_ ; _large_ becomes _larger_

or _largest_ ; _cute_ becomes _cuter_ or _cutest_ )


 - Have students fill in the blanks with forms of the word _wide_ :


    - The creek is  . ( _wide_ )


    - The river is than the creek. ( _wider_ )


    - The ocean is the of all three bodies of water. ( _widest_ )


 - Tell students that when a one-syllable adjective that ends with a single vowel

and consonant is to be used to compare, the final consonant is doubled before

adding the suffixes – _er_ or – _est_ . (e.g., _sad_ becomes _sadder_ or _saddest_ ; _big_

becomes _bigger_ or _biggest_ ; _hot_ becomes _hotter_ or _hottest_ )

questions to guide the discussion, but allow

students to use their prior knowledge about


John Cabot from Lesson 8 to contribute new questions and/or interpretations.

Whenever possible, challenge students to speak in complete sentences, use

domain vocabulary, and justify their answers with a _because_ statement. For

example: I think the man in this picture lived long ago _because_ he is wearing a

hat that people today do not usually wear.

4. Does his clothing tell you anything about the time or place in which he lived?


» Answers will vary but may include: He does not live in our time because

clothing today (for example, Cabot’s hat) does not usually look like the

clothing in this picture.

Why are they holding those objects?


» Answers will vary but may include: There is a flag because Cabot would use it to

claim the new land he found for England.



7. What do you think that is in the bottom right corner?


» a globe


8. Does it look the same as our globe? Why/why not?


» Answers will vary, but guide the students toward noticing that the globe in the

painting is an oval, and ours is a round sphere. The globe is an oval because

that represents John Cabot’s knowledge of lines of longitude and latitude which

informed him that the quickest route to Asia would be over the top of the world.


9. What do you think the man is pointing at? Why?


» Answers will vary.


 - Once the discussion is over, some students may still have questions or

comments to contribute. For the sake of time, give those students an index

card and ask them to write down their question or comment, and then hand it

in. Read over these cards later in the day, and if any are particularly pertinent

 - After modeling this sentence, write the phrase _I believe_ on the chart paper

titled “Opinion Sentence Starters.” Explain to students that the words

_I believe_ are a signal that the speaker is about to give his/her opinion.

Then write the word _tastiest_ on the chart paper titled “Comparative and

Superlative Adjectives.”


 - As students share their opinions, record other sentence starters and adjectives

on the sheets of chart paper. Leave these up in the classroom for students to

reference while they write. Keep the charts on display in the classroom for the

remainder of the unit for student reference during future lessons.

 - Direct students to **page 69** of the Reader and Activity Page 9.1: Opinion

Prewriting Part A. Work together as a class to read through **pages 69–72** . At

the end of each paragraph, record positive and negative aspects of life as a

sailor into the chart on Activity Page 9.1: Opinion Prewriting Part A.


 - Tell students that they will pretend to be a sailor onboard John Cabot’s ship

and write a paragraph giving their opinion of whether or not the hardships that

they faced were worth the adventure. They should make sure to use at least

two facts from the chart in their opinion. They can also use any prior knowledge

that they may remember from other chapters in this unit to form their opinions.

Tell students that they will be writing their paragraph independently while other

students meet with the teacher for a purposeful re-reading lesson on John

Cabot.


 - Students will write their response on Activity Page 9.1: Part B.

**232**



**Hardtack** was a kind of bread that was baked over
and over. **Hardtack** was so hard, it was tough to eat.
Sailors had to soak it in a drink to soften it up. The
good thing about **hardtack**, though, was that it would
not **spoil** on a long **voyage** . It was so hard, bugs had
trouble getting into it—unless it got wet. Once it got
wet, weevils and other bugs could and did get into it.
But you could usually see them and brush them off with
your fingers.


If a **voyage** was going well, sailors might get other
kinds of food. They might get a little salted meat now
and then. They might get some fish or a few beans. But
if supplies were running low, they might get nothing
but **hardtack** .


The diet on sailing ships was so bad that many
sailors got sick. Lots of them got a disease called **scurvy** .
Today, we know now that **scurvy** is caused by a lack of
vitamin C, found in fresh fruits and vegetables. In the
Age of **Exploration**, people did not know this. So many
sailors died.


70 71


Unit 8


After a long day of work, sailors were ready to fall
into bed and rest their aching bones. They were ready—
but there were no beds for them to fall into. The captain
had a bed to sleep in, but the sailors did not. They slept
on the deck. As the ship rolled back and forth with the
waves, the sailors rolled with it.


Most sailors had to stand **watch** for part of the night.
When that was done, they could sleep for a few hours. In
the morning, they would get up and do it all over again.
A sailor’s day started bright and early.


So, what do you think? Does a sailor’s life sound
good to you?

would write that word under the header ‘ew’ > /oo/. Tell students that they

may not have to use all the lines under each header.


 - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and

answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all

assignments in this unit. ~~**[ TEKS 3.2.D ]**~~


 - Using the list below, call out the words using the following format: say the

~~**SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


**Unit 8, Lesson 9**


1. Students are likely to write the incorrect form of /oo/: For ‘oo’, students may

write ‘ew’, ‘o’, or ‘o_e’.


2. For ‘ew’, students may write ‘oo’, ‘o’, or ‘o_e’.


3. For ‘o’, students may write ‘oo’, ‘ew’, or ‘o_e’.


4. For ‘o_e’, students may write ‘oo’, ‘ew’, or ‘o’.


5. While the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should be aware

that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find it helpful to

record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the analysis chart.

For example: Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels?

Which ones?


6. Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


7. Is the student consistently making errors on particular beginning consonants?


8. Did the student write words for each feature correctly?


9. Also, examine the dictated sentences for errors in capitalization

and punctuation.

Challenge


Did Hudson know that the
land Cabot had claimed
was not the Indies? How do
you know?


» Hudson knew it was North
America because 1607 is
the year Jamestown
was settled.











**Student Reader pages 74 –75**
Portrait of Henry Hudson and Map
Showing His Sailing Idea


John Cabot was not the only person who

wanted to find a Northwest Passage

to the Indies. English explorer Henry







Hudson had the same goal. Very little is known about Henry Hudson’s early

life, but we do know he had an interest in **exploring** Arctic geography.


Hudson made his first attempt to find the Northwest Passage in

1607, more than 100 years after Cabot made his **voyages** . Hudson’s

idea about how he might get to the Indies was similar to Cabot’s.


**TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text.


Lesson 10 Henry Hudson
**243**


Hudson’s idea was to sail north, right over the North Pole. He knew

the polar region was cold and icy, but he also knew that the sun never

set during the summer months. He thought the summer sun might

melt a lot of the ice, making it possible to sail over the top of the

earth and come out on the other side of the world in Asia.



**Student Reader pages 75-76**
Hudson’s Boat Stuck in Pack Ice


In May of 1607, Hudson **embarked**

from England with a single ship called

the _Hopewell_ . Six weeks later his men

sighted the eastern coast of Greenland.







Challenge


Ask for a student volunteer
to locate Greenland on
Image Card C.U8.L3.1, or on
a world map or globe.


Challenge


Why did they not stop in
Greenland, thinking it was
the Indies?


» Cabot and other explorers
had already proven that
North America was a
“new” landmass that lay
in between Europe
and Asia.


Support


“Touch and go” is a saying
that means that someone
is in a dangerous or
unpredictable situation. You
will learn more about this
saying later.


**244**



Hudson sailed along the eastern coast of Greenland and then turned and

sailed northeast because there was so much ice. During their **voyage**,

he and his men saw many **unfamiliar** creatures, including whales, seals,

and walruses.


In mid-July, they reached the Spitsbergen **Archipelago** (ahr-kuh-pel
uh-goh), which is a chain of islands that has an arctic climate. When

Hudson tried to **navigate** this region, it was surrounded by pack ice,

or frozen seawater. On May 16, Hudson’s ship almost got stuck in

the ice. For a while, it was “touch and go.” A few days later, Hudson

decided he could not reach the North Pole because of all the ice. He

turned around and sailed back to England.







**Student Reader pages 76–77**
Map Showing Hudson’s Three Voyages


In 1608, Hudson made a second

attempt to reach the East Indies by

sailing the _Hopewell_ across the North

Pole. He sailed north of Scandinavia





and Russia. He sailed more than two thousand five hundred miles,

making it to the islands off the coast of Russia known as Novaya

Zemlya (“New Land”). But again, there was so much ice in the water

that he had to turn back.



Unit 8


In 1609, Hudson made a third attempt to find the Northwest Passage.

This time, he sailed for the Dutch under the Dutch East India Company.

The Dutch East India Company was a **trading company** that formed to

protect their **trade** in what was called the East Indies. The company hired

Hudson and told him to follow a similar route he had attempted on his

previous **voyage**, sailing north of Scandinavia and Russia. The hope was

that he would be able to sail over the top of the earth and land in Asia.

Hudson left Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in April of 1609, onboard the

Dutch ship, the _Half Moon_ . As he made his way north, he saw more and

more ice. Eventually, there was so much ice that Hudson decided to give

up and turn around in mid-May.


Instead of sailing back to Amsterdam, as he had been told to do, Hudson

decided to sail west. Hudson sailed across the Atlantic and sighted

Newfoundland on July 12. He sailed along the coast of North America,

**exploring** much of what is now the east coast of the United States.

He and his men sailed as far south as Virginia, where the Jamestown

settlement had recently been **established** . Then they turned north.

Challenge


_Upstream_ means to go
against the flow of the river.
Because this river flows
from a higher place in the
north to a lower one in the
south, in which direction
did Hudson sail if he sailed
upstream?


» north



**Student Reader page 78**
Hudson Sailing Up River


On September 3, they came upon

a large river that emptied into

the Atlantic. Hudson and his men

**explored** the river, sailing upstream.









When Hudson saw the river widening out, he thought the river he

was exploring might be the Northwest Passage that he and explorers

before him had been seeking for years. Farther upstream, the river

**narrowed**, and Hudson began to think maybe it would not lead him

through the continent. Nevertheless, it was an interesting discovery.

Hudson claimed the area for the Netherlands and the Dutch.

a mutiny? (a refusal by
followers to obey the rules
and orders of the person
in charge). Here, _mutiny_ is
used as a verb.

Americans tried to attack them, but others visited the ship to **trade** .

The Natives offered furs to Hudson in **trade**, and this started the fur

**trade** along the Hudson River. One group invited Hudson to dinner.

Later, Hudson described what he had experienced in his journal:


“I sailed to the shore in one of their canoes, with an old man who was

the chief of a tribe consisting of forty men and seventeen women.

These I saw there, in a house well-constructed of oak bark, and

circular in shape, so that it had the appearance of being built with

an arched roof. It contained a great quantity of maize or Indian corn,

and beans of the last year’s growth; and there lay near the house, for

the purpose of drying, enough to load three ships, besides what was

growing in the fields. On our coming into the house, two mats were

spread out to sit upon, and some food was immediately served in

well-made red wooden bowls.


Two men . . . brought in a pair of pigeons, which they had shot. . . They

supposed that I would remain with them for the night; but I returned,

after a short time, on board the ship. The land is the finest for

**cultivation** that I ever in my life set foot upon, and it also **abounds**

in trees of every description. These Natives are a very good people;

for when they saw that I would not remain, they supposed that I was

afraid of their bows; and, taking their arrows, they broke them in

pieces and threw them into the fire.”


In late September, Hudson decided to sail back to Europe. He himself

wanted to stay in the Americas for the winter, but his men were tired

of **exploring** and were threatening to **mutiny** .

Hudson River Today


The river that Hudson discovered on his

third **voyage** was later named after him.

Even today it is known as the Hudson

River. Other Dutchmen came to this





part of the world after Hudson. They built a city at the mouth of the

Hudson River, on an island the Natives called Mannahatta. The Dutch

called this city New Amsterdam. Later its name was changed to New

York. Today, Manhattan is the name of one of the parts of New York

City, and New York City is the most populous city in the United States.

Map of Fourth Voyage


In 1610, Hudson set off on a fourth

**voyage** . This time, he was sponsored

by two English companies—the Virginia

Company and the British East India



Company. Similar to the Dutch East India Company, these companies

were also **trading companies** . Hudson’s goal was the same: to find a

Northwest Passage, a water route that would lead through the American

continent and allow ships to sail to Asia.


Hudson sailed west, but he stayed far to the north. He reached

Greenland in early June. A few weeks later he and his men found a

large **strait** that led into the center of North America. Hudson hoped it

might lead all the way through to Asia.


On August 2, Hudson sailed out of the **strait** and into a large bay. Today this

bay is known as the Hudson Bay, and the **strait** is known as the Hudson

**Strait** . Hudson spent the next few months **exploring** the coast of the bay.


In November, his ship got stuck in the ice. He and his crew had to go

ashore for the winter. It was a difficult, freezing cold winter. The men

were fighting with Hudson as well as with one another. Several of them

fell ill with **scurvy**, a disease that preys on people who have not been

eating a healthy, balanced diet.

Hudson Abandoned by His Crew


When spring came, Hudson wanted

to **explore** some more. Most of the

men on the ship wanted to sail back to

England. A big fight broke out.









In the end, the sailors **mutinied** . They put Hudson, his son, and some

others they did not like in a small, open boat and sailed away. Henry

Hudson, the great **explorer**, was never heard from again.

2. **Inferential.** What made Hudson realize this river was not the Northwest

Passage for which he was searching?


» Farther upstream, the river narrowed.


3. **Literal.** How did Hudson’s third voyage end?


» When Hudson’s crew threatened to mutiny, they returned to Europe before

the winter.

» Answers will vary, but could include that the sailors were upset with Hudson

because they wanted to return home and he wanted to continue exploring.

Unit 8


In mid-July they reached the Spitsbergen
**archipelago** [ahr-kuh-pel-uh-goh] which is a chain of
islands that has an arctic climate. When Hudson tried to
**navigate** this region, it was surrounded by pack ice, or
frozen seawater. On May 16, Hudson’s ship almost got
stuck in the ice. For a while, it was “touch and go.” A few
days later, Hudson decided he could not reach the North
Pole because of all the ice. He turned around and sailed
back to England.


In 1608, Hudson made a second attempt to reach the
East Indies by sailing the _Hopewell_ across the North Pole.
He sailed north of Scandinavia and Russia. He sailed
more than two thousand five hundred miles, making it
to the islands off the coast of Russia known as Novaya
Zemlya (“New Land”). But again, there was so much ice
in the water that he had to turn back.


In 1609, Hudson made a third attempt to find the
Northwest Passage. This time he sailed for the Dutch
under the Dutch East India Company. The Dutch East
India Company was a **trading company** that formed to
protect their **trade** in what was called the East Indies.
The company hired Hudson and told him to follow a
similar route he had attempted on his previous **voyage**,
sailing north of Scandinavia and Russia. The hope
was that he would be able to sail over the top of the



_Map showing Hudson’s three_ _**voyages**_


earth and land in Asia. Hudson left Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, in April of 1609, onboard the Dutch ship,
the _Half Moon_ . As he made his way north, he saw more
and more ice. Eventually, there was so much ice that
Hudson decided to give up and turn around in mid-May.


Instead of sailing back to Amsterdam, as he had
been told to do, Hudson decided to sail west. Hudson
sailed across the Atlantic and sighted Newfoundland on
July 12. He sailed along the coast of North America,
**exploring** much of what is now the east coast of United
States. He and his men sailed as far south as Virginia,
where the Jamestown settlement had recently been
**established** . Then they turned north.

Lesson 10 Henry Hudson
**253**


_Hudson sailing upriver_


On September 3, they came upon a large river
that emptied into the Atlantic. Hudson and his men
**explored** the river, sailing upstream. When Hudson
saw the river widening out, he thought the river he
was **exploring** might be the Northwest Passage that he
and **explorers** before him had been seeking for years.
Farther upstream, the river **narrowed**, and Hudson
began to think maybe it would not lead him through
the continent. Nevertheless, it was an interesting
discovery. Hudson claimed the area for the Netherlands
and the Dutch.



Hudson and his crew encountered many Native
Americans of the **Algonquian** -speaking tribes on their
trip up the river. Some Native Americans tried to attack
them but others visited the ship to **trade** . The Natives
offered furs to Hudson in **trade**, and this started the
fur **trade** along the Hudson River. One group invited
Hudson to dinner. Later, Hudson described what he had

 - Cover the headers so that students cannot see them.


**Note:** During this week, students will review spellings of /f/ spelled ‘f’, ‘ff’,

‘ph’, and ‘gh’. Students should be familiar with these spellings as they were

taught in Grade 2.


 - Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


    - ‘f’ is the most common spelling for the /f/ sound. It is used in the initial

position ( _fun_, _fig_ ), in the final position ( _leaf_, _deaf_ ), in the initial consonant

clusters _fl–_ and _fr–_ (flop, fresh), in the final consonant clusters – _ft_, – _fth_,

and – _lf_ ( _lift, fifth, elf_ ), and with separated digraphs ( _safe_, _life_ ).


    - Only ‘f’ and ‘ph’ are used at the beginning of words and syllables.


    - ‘f’, ‘ff’, and ‘ph’ are used at the end of words and syllables.


    - ‘ff’ is commonly found after “short” vowels written with single-letter

spellings; thus, we write _stiff_ but _deaf_ .


**TEKS 3.2.B** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables,
(iv) spelling multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns.

ask them to write a word

list that could fit under one
of the chart headings.


**258**




   - ‘ph’ is used mainly to spell words borrowed from Greek. It is used in the

consonant cluster – _mph_ ( _lymph_ ).


   - Words with final /f/ tend to keep the spelling they have in the root form,

even when suffixes beginning with a vowel sound are added: _leaf_    - _leafy_ ;

_oaf_    - _oafish_ ; _stuff_    - _stuffy_ .


   - ‘gh’ > /f/ rarely occurs, but when it does, it is at the end of root words

( _laugh_, _rough_ ).


- Tell students that this week they will be reviewing spellings of /f/. Ask: “Can

you think of any words that you already know which feature the /f/ sound?”

Have students share any words they know with a partner. Call on a few

students to share their words with the class.


- Divide the class into two groups and pass out one set of spelling words to each

group. Ask students to work as a group to determine the common spelling

patterns among this week’s words. Students should take turns reading the

words aloud so that they can read patterns that may not be obvious otherwise.

Direct the groups to sort the spelling words according to the patterns that

they think they see.


- Allow each group to present the groupings that they have created and explain

their reasoning behind each one. Hint and advise students as to whether or

not they have come close to solving this week’s spelling pattern.


- Uncover the headings on the chart or DP.U8.L10.4. Call on students to bring

one spelling word card to the chart and place it under the correct header.


**Note:** You may wish to have students read the decodable passage, “A Tale

- Read the questions aloud in a choral read with the class before moving on to

the Read-Aloud.


- Tell students that before they begin to learn about Samuel de Champlain’s

explorations, there are two important terms that they need to know. The first is

the word _pelt_ . A pelt is the fur and skin of an animal. In the time of Champlain,

people did not have a lot of options for what they could use to make clothing

and stay warm. In Europe, people made their clothes from wool or animal

pelts. Some very rich people had clothes made from silk. Ask students, “Which

of those would be the warmest? Which do you think was hardest to find?”


- Tell students that the second word they will need to know is _trade_ . This type

of trade is similar to trading you may do all the time, such as trading baseball

cards or trading lunches. In this chapter, you will learn that the word _trade_ can

also be a noun that means a business. Before people used dollars and cents

to buy things in stores, they went to trading posts and traded something that

they had a lot of for something that they needed.

a **reputation** for being a talented **navigator** by leading a two-year

**expedition** to the West Indies and Central America. The son of a sea

captain, he was not born into high social **status** in France, but his

accomplishments as a **navigator** and talented mapmaker earned him

an **honorary** title of “royal geographer” from King Henry IV in his court.


In 1603, Champlain was invited to sail in a French fur- **trading**

**expedition** to an area known at the time as “New France” in present
day Canada. Decades before Champlain’s **expeditions**, in 1534, a

French **navigator** and **explorer**, Jacques Cartier, claimed the shores

of the St. Lawrence River, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the areas now

known as Newfoundland and Nova Scotia in honor of France. Cartier’s

attempt to colonize an area around present-day Quebec failed at that

time, but these **explorations** were only the beginning of a fur- **trading**

relationship between France and the Natives in the area of “New France.”

Champlain on Fur-Trading Expedition


The goal of Champlain’s 1603

**expedition** was to **trade** with the

Native people in the area of “New

France” and return home with



beaver **pelts** and other furs that could be sold in France. During

this **voyage**, Champlain talked to fur **traders** and fishermen and

met Native people of the areas he visited. He made a map of the St.

Lawrence River, a long river that flows away from the Great Lakes and

empties into the Atlantic Ocean. When he returned home to France,

Champlain published a report on his **expedition** .

colonists. They suffered a difficult winter in their original settlement

near the mouth of the St. Croix River, during which almost half of

the colonists died. After Champlain and a few men **scouted** the

surrounding area, the surviving colonists moved to the area presently

known as Nova Scotia. This colonization attempt was not a success,

but Champlain took this time to explore and map areas along the

Atlantic coast, eventually sailing as far south as Cape Cod.





**Student Reader pages 87-89**
Map of St. Lawrence River Colony
with Maps of Routes around America


After **exploring** several possible

locations along the northeastern

Atlantic coast, Champlain decided









that the best place for a French colony was along the St. Lawrence

River. Champlain **envisioned** this colony becoming a control center

for the fur **trade** . This was a sign of an important change in the way

Europeans thought about North America. John Cabot and Henry

Hudson had been trying to find a way to go around America, or a

way to go through it. They were not especially interested in America

and its resources. They were interested in goods from Asia and what

was called the East Indies, such as **spices** and silk. They thought of

America as something that was blocking their way. With Champlain,

there was a new way of thinking.


Champlain was still interested in finding a Northwest Passage. He

went on several **expeditions** where that was an important goal.

But he and many of the men who came after him began to think of

North America not just as an obstacle on the path to more **profitable**

places, but as a place that was **profitable** in its own right—and a

place that might be worth settling.



Unit 8


**Student Reader pages 89-90**
Settling Quebec City


In 1608, Champlain received

permission to lead an **expedition**

of three ships and about thirty-two

colonists from France. He sailed up



the river and **established** a settlement, which was named Quebec

City. Only nine of the original colonists, including Champlain, survived

the first cold winter in Quebec City, but more settlers arrived the

following June. At first, Quebec City was little more than a fort, but

Champlain had a dream—he hoped that Quebec City would be the

capital of a large and prosperous French colony. He spent the rest of

his life working to make that dream a reality.


Champlain set up a fur- **trading** station in Quebec City. Native

Americans could bring animal furs to the city, and French **traders**

would buy the furs and ship them back to France.

Champlain Trading with Native Allies


To ensure protection for the

settlement in Quebec City, Champlain

made an agreement with some of

the tribes who lived along the St.







Lawrence, including the Huron and the **Algonquian** people. He

supported these tribes in a war against the Iroquois, a large group

of tribes who lived to the south in what is now New York State.

Champlain led **expeditions** against the Iroquois and in 1609, he

became the first European to visit the lake that is now named for

him, Lake Champlain. In 1615, he became the first known European to

arrive at the Great Lakes. There was more than just a military alliance

between Champlain and the tribes, however; they learned things

from each other as well. Even the name of the new city, Quebec, was

borrowed from the **Algonquian** language spoken by many Native

Both the Algonquian and Iroquois tribes still have thriving cultures,

with many of their people still living in these regions today.







**Student Reader pages 91-92**
French missionaries


Champlain made several trips to

France to **recruit** new settlers and

secure French government support

of his colony. He eventually married



and brought his new wife to settle with him in Quebec City. He also

brought missionaries to “New France” to teach the Native people

about Christianity. The missionaries worked with the fur **traders** and

the settlers to extend French settlements farther inland. In the end,

Champlain was successful. The colony of Quebec did not just survive;

it prospered. It became the first permanent French settlement on the

continent of North America. The areas that made up “New France”

remained part of the French empire for more than one hundred years

and, in time, became part of a larger country now known as Canada.

European Explorers

**explorers** and their **expeditions** . You

have learned that they were all so





intrigued by stories of wealth, **spices**, and gold that they decided to

**explore** **unfamiliar** lands and seas. These **explorers embarked** on

investigative travels to find answers to their questions.


Now it’s our turn to ask a question: Who was the first known European to

explore America?



Unit 8


As you have heard, Christopher Columbus is the European often

credited with “discovering” the Americas. While searching for a route

to the East Indies, he unintentionally arrived at the islands in the

Caribbean, now known as the West Indies.


John Cabot landed in a part of Canada that we call Newfoundland.

Newfoundland, like the islands of the Caribbean, were not empty, but

filled with people who inhabited it already.


All of the European **explorers** we’ve learned about—Columbus, Ponce

de León, de Soto, Coronado, de Vaca, Cabot, Hudson, and Champlain—

landed in many different parts of the Americas, claiming their

discoveries in honor of their countries. Without their knowledge, these

explorers made landfall in places in North America that people were

already living. Who were these people?

Native Americans


What do you remember about the

Native Americans? There were millions

of Native people in the Americas when

European explorers first arrived.



The Native peoples lived according to their own customs and

cultures, had developed their own farming, trade, and economic

systems, and built great civilizations in the Americas. Europeans

**exploring** and later settling in the Americas brought with them their

own cultures and curiosity. Unintentionally, explorers brought over

diseases which resulted in the deaths of millions of Native Americans.


Although we cannot know for sure who were the first people living

in the Americas and when or how they arrived, what we can say for

certain is that the history, culture, and legacy of both the Native

Americans and the European **explorers** are still evident today.

worked with them against some competing tribes such as the Iroquois confederacy.


5. **Evaluative.** How did this relationship compare to some of the former

interactions of Europeans and Native Americans?


» Champlain formed alliances with the Native Americans, and these alliances were

more than military alliances. The French merchants and the Native Americans

traded with each other and learned from one another. The name of the new city,

Quebec, was borrowed from the Algonquian people’s language. The settlement of

Quebec prospered with Native American cooperation.

 - Tell students that you will read a sentence to them. The sentence contains

a word with either the prefix _pro_   - or _anti_ –. Students must determine if the

sentence demonstrates the meaning of the word. If so, students should say

yes. If not, students should say no. Tell students that they may use print or

Read the following sentence aloud to students:


  - We can project light onto the wall and use different items to make

shadows.




 - Ask, “What word has the prefix _pro_  - or _anti_  - in this sentence?” ( _project)_


 - Then ask, “Does this sentence demonstrate the meaning of _project_ ? Why or

why not? Tell students to turn and talk with a partner.


» Yes. _Project_ means to throw forward, and if you project light, you are throwing it

forward onto something.


 - Next, read the following sentence aloud to students:


    - The anticlimactic ending to the book was full of twists and turns and I

couldn’t put the book down!


 - Ask, “What word has the prefix _pro_  - or _anti_ –?”


» _anticlimactic_


 - Then ask, “Does this sentence demonstrate the meaning of _anticlimactic_ ? Why

or why not?”


» No. _Anticlimactic_ means the opposite of the most exciting part of the story,

or disappointing, so if the ending was full of twists and turns and the person

reading the book couldn’t put it down, then that does not demonstrate a lack of

excitement or disappointment.

message or theme with the reader, inform the reader about a certain topic, or

persuade the reader to think or feel a certain way.

» Authors write poems for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it is to express their

feelings, while other times it is to share a message or theme. Authors can write

poetry to inform the reader about a certain topic or to persuade them to think or

feel a certain way.


- Remind the students of what they have previously learned about the author’s

purpose, and encourage them to distinguish what the author is trying to

convey in this poem.

- Before beginning the reading, review the vocabulary for this lesson to activate

students’ background knowledge on typical structural elements of poetry.


   - **poetry**, written or spoken work that expresses feelings and thoughts by

using specific styles and rhythms


   - **stanza**, a group of lines in a poem


    - The poem below has seven stanzas. Each stanza is made up of four lines.


   - **rhyme scheme**, the pattern of rhymes that come at the end of lines in a poem


    - The rhyme scheme of each stanza of the poem is ABCB because the

1st and 3rd do not rhyme, but the 2nd and 4th lines do rhyme.


   - **sound device**, attributes of literature that emphasize sound


    - The rhythm in this poem is established by the rhyme scheme. The

rhythm helps the poem flow more smoothly and makes it easier for the

reader to pick out elements like rhyme, onomatopoeia, etc.


~~**READ-ALOUD: “EARLY EXPLORERS” (20 MIN.)**~~


- Project Digital Projection U8.L13.1. Each page is a different stanza.


- If possible, mark up the stanzas as you go, underlining the text that supports

the answers to the checks for understanding.


_Columbus set sail for the Indies,_

_the Bahamas he found,_ _**unsought**_ _._

_His men searched for riches a’plenty_

_But it didn’t go quite as he thought._


Unit 8


Check for Understanding


Did Columbus reach the Indies? Where did he end up?


» No, Columbus did not reach the Indies. He ended up in the

Bahamas.


_John Cabot sailed over from England._

_He and his crew discovered new land._

_He introduced the world to Canada,_

_through trade he helped them expand._


- Point to Canada on the map.


Check for Understanding


What do you notice about the last words in lines 2 and 4?


» “land” and “expand” rhyme.


Do lines 1 and 3 rhyme?


» No, “England” and “Canada” do not rhyme.


If lines 1 and 3 do not rhyme but lines 2 and 4 do, what is the rhyme
scheme of the stanza?


» It is ABCB.


_Another explorer, de Vaca,_

_Was sent to find land for the King._

_The first explorer to journey to Texas,_

_His experience was very_ _**daunting**_ _._



Support


Students are most likely
not familiar with the word
_unsought_ . Have them look
at the definition of the word
in the reader glossary.
Help them understand that
the line “the Bahamas he
found, unsought” means
that Columbus wasn’t
looking for the Bahamas,
but he found them anyway.


Challenge


Have students identify the
rhyme scheme of each
stanza and then the overall
rhyme scheme of the
entire poem.



Lesson 13 Early Explorers
**307**


Support


Show an image of the
Grand Canyon.


Challenge


Ask students to think of
another word for _quest_ .



Check for Understanding


What do you remember about Cabeza de Vaca’s journey? Why would the
poem describe it as daunting?


» Cabeza de Vaca was shipwrecked in Galveston and spent years

wandering through the southwest. It was daunting because he

lost almost all of his crew, he had no knowledge of the land, and he

came under attack from Native Americans.


_De Soto and his crew set out_

_He first landed down in Peru_

_They made it back up to Florida_

_There was much more exploring to do._


Check for Understanding


Do you remember where De Soto and his crew explored?


» De Soto and his crew explored Florida and the American southeast.


_Coronado set out for Mexico,_

_“Search for gold” was his motto._

_He saw the Grand Canyon and many more landmarks_

_on his_ _**quest**_ _for El Dorado._


Check for Understanding


Make an Inference: What do you think it was like to see the Grand Canyon
for the first time?


» Answers may vary, but could include “overwhelming,” “scary,”

“shocking,” “disbelief.”


Unit 8



**308**


_Henry Hudson searched for the Northwest Passage,_

_“A shortcut East is what I foresee.”_

_He never did find it, but what he provided_

_taught new explorers about what they would see._


Check for Understanding


How are Henry Hudson and John Cabot’s journeys similar?


» They both journeyed to the same area of the North American

continent. Both of them were searching for the Northwest Passage.

Neither one of them found it.


_These early explorers, plus many more,_

_They found new land long ago._

_They_ _**documented**_ _their travels, they couldn’t have imagined_

_that they would be studied so._


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Evaluative** . What structural elements are evident within the poem? How do

they impact the poem?


» Each stanza has a rhyme scheme of ABCB. The rhyme scheme helps form the

rhythm of the poem. The rhythm makes the poem flow easier.


2. **Inferential** . In the last lines of the seventh stanza, it says “..they couldn’t

have imagined that they would be studied so.” What do you think these early

explorers would think about us still studying them today?


» Answers will vary, but could include, “They would be surprised that we still learn

about them because they lived so long ago,” or “They would be happy that we still

learn about them because their work was important.”


3. **Evaluative.** What is a possible theme of this poem?


» Answers will vary, but could include, “exploration,” “adventure,” “hardships,”

“courage.”


4. **Literal.** Who was the explorer in this poem who discovered Texas?


» Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca

Lesson 14 Unit Assessment
**321**


**Note:** Students will complete an assessment by reading three selections

during one sitting and answering comprehension, grammar, morphology,

and spelling questions that follow each selection. Students will not read out

of their Reader but rather from Activity Page 14.1, where the selections have

been printed.

Activity Page 14.1



~~**STUDENT SKILLS ASSESSMENT (60 MIN.)**~~


- Have students take out Activity Page 14.1.


- Tell students they will read three selections printed on Activity Page 14.1 and

answer comprehension, morphology, grammar, and spelling questions that

follow each selection.


- Tell students that, should they feel tired, it’s a good idea to take a short,

personal break.


- Explain to students that they need to respect the others in the classroom and

stay seated, while quietly looking up to the ceiling, stretching their shoulders,

and taking a deep breath or two.


- Tell students they should go right on to the second selection once they

have finished the first, and right on to the third selection once they have

finished the second.


- Encourage students to do their best.


- Once students finish all three selections, encourage them to review their

papers, rereading and looking over their answers carefully.


- Again, explain the necessity of respecting that not all classmates will finish at

the same time, and, if they finish and have checked their papers, they should

remain quiet and allow others to finish.

**Primary Focus:** Students will apply spelling patterns to correctly spell

words containing the /f/ sound.

~~**TEKS 3.2.B.i; TEKS 3.2.B.iv; TEKS 3.2.D**~~


~~**SPELLING ASSESSMENT (30 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students turn to Activity Page 14.2 for the spelling assessment.


 - If you would like for students to have pens, this is the time to pass them out.


 - Tell students that for this assessment, they will write the words under the

header to which they belong. For example, if you call out the word _famous_,

they would write that word under the header ‘f’ > /f/.


 - Tell students that they may not have to use all the lines under each header.


 - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and

answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all

assignments in this unit. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~

**Primary Focus:** Students will read with sufficient accuracy and fluency to

support comprehension. ~~**TEKS 3.4**~~


~~**OPTIONAL FLUENCY ASSESSMENT**~~


 - You will call students individually to read this fluency assessment to you. While

students read, ask the rest of the class to silently free-read or free-write.

 - Turn to the text copy of “Christopher Columbus and John Cabot: Parallel Lives”

at the end of this lesson. This is the text copy students will read aloud.

 - Ask the student to remove Activity Page 14.3 from their Activity Book. You will

use this activity page to mark as a running record as you listen to the student

read orally.

 - Tell the student that you are going to ask them to read the selection aloud.

Explain that you are going to keep a record of the amount of time it takes them

to read the selection. Please also explain to the student that they should not

rush but rather read at his or her own regular pace.

 - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the selection. If you are

using a watch, write the exact Start Time, in minutes and seconds, on your

record page. If you are using a stopwatch, you do not need to write down the

start time as the stopwatch will calculate Elapsed Time. As the student reads

the selection, make a running record on the copy with the student’s name

using the following guidelines.

|Words read correctly|No mark is required.|
|---|---|
|**Omissions**|Draw a long dash above the word omitted.|
|**Insertions**|Write a caret (^) at the point where the insertion<br>was made. If you have time, write down the word<br>that was inserted.|
|**Words read incorrectly**|Write an “X” above the word.|
|**Substitutions**|Write the substitution above the word.|
|**Self-corrected errors**|Replace original error mark with an “SC.”|
|**Teacher-supplied words**|Write a “T” above the word (counts as an error).|



**TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text.



Activity Page 14.3



Lesson 14 Unit Assessment
**325**


**326**




 - When the student finishes reading the chapter, write the exact Finish Time

in minutes and seconds on your record sheet. Alternatively, if you are using

a stopwatch, simply write down the Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds.

If the student does not read to the end, draw a vertical line on the record

sheet to indicate how far they read before you stopped him or her. Also write

down either the Finish Time or the Elapsed Time. After the student finishes

reading orally, you may direct him or her to finish reading the remainder of the

selection silently; you may also assess comprehension by having the student

complete the comprehension questions orally.


**Oral Comprehension Questions on “Christopher Columbus**
**and John Cabot: Parallel Lives”**


1. Which explorers are compared in the article?


» Christopher Columbus and John Cabot


2. What are some similarities between Columbus and Cabot?


» both important explorers, lived at the same time, were about the same age, were

Italian, studied maps, went on three voyages


3. What are some differences?


» Columbus was a sailor and Cabot was a merchant. They had different views on the

best way to reach the Indies. Columbus became famous and Cabot was not.


4. What did Cabot think was wrong about Columbus’s approach to exploration?


» Cabot felt it would be shorter to go north over the top of Earth rather than the

longer way around the equator.


 - Repeat this process for additional students. Scoring can be done later,

provided you have kept running records and jotted down either the Elapsed

Time or the Start Time and the Finish Time.


**Guidelines for Calculating W.C.P.M. Scores**


 - If the reading was fairly accurate (< 10 uncorrected errors), you can get a

rough (and easy) estimate of a student’s W.C.P.M. score simply by noting the

time and looking at the chart on Activity Page 14.3.


 - To calculate a student’s exact W.C.P.M. score, use the information you wrote

down on the record sheet and follow the steps below. The steps are also shown

in graphic form on Activity Page 14.3. You will probably find it helpful to have a

calculator available.


1. First, complete the Words section of Activity Page 14.3.


2. Count Words Read. This is the total number of words that the student read

or attempted to read, up to the point where he or she stopped. It includes


Unit 8


words that the student read correctly as well as words that the student

read incorrectly or skipped over. If the student attempted to read the whole

selection, use 467 words total. If the student did not finish the selection, you

will need to count the number of words that the student actually attempted to

read. Write the count for Words Read in the matching box on Activity Page 14.3.


3. Count the Uncorrected Mistakes noted in your running record. This includes

words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and words that you had to

supply. Write the total in the box labeled Uncorrected Mistakes on Activity

Page 14.3. (A mistake that is corrected by the student is not counted as

a mistake; the student is penalized for the time he or she lost making the

correction, but not for the initial mistake.)


4. Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get Words Correct.


5. Next, complete the Time section of the activity page.


6. Calculate Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a stopwatch,

this should already be done for you. Skip to the next step.) If you used a watch

and recorded start and stop times, you will need to subtract the Start Time

from the Finish Time to calculate the Elapsed Time. Subtract seconds from

seconds and then minutes from minutes. Calculate Time in Seconds. Multiply

the number of minutes by 60 to convert minutes to seconds, and then add the

number of seconds.


7. Next, complete the W.C.P.M. section of the activity page.


8. Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then multiply by 60 to get Words

Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.).


 - As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider.


    - It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.

scores. However, a major goal for Grade 3 students is to read with

sufficient fluency to ensure comprehension and independent reading of

school assignments in subsequent grades. Exact fluency targets vary from

state to state; the national mean calculated by Hasbrouck and Tindal in

2006 for Spring of Grade 3 is 107 W.C.P.M.


    - A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared with the score of other

students in the classroom (or grade level) and also with the national

fluency norms for Spring of Grade 3 obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal.

Students whose scores are below the 25th percentile (78 W.C.P.M) are

experiencing serious problems in reading fluently.

Student Name Date


**Christopher Columbus and John Cabot:**

**Parallel Lives**


Christopher Columbus was an important explorer. So was 8


John Cabot. The two men lived at the same time. They were almost 21


the same age. They were rivals, too. Their lives were connected in 33


interesting ways. 35


Columbus was probably born in 1451. John Cabot may have been 46


born the same year. 50


Columbus was Italian. He was born in Genoa. Cabot was also Italian. 62


We are not sure where he was born. He may have been born in Genoa. 77


In the 1470s, Columbus worked as a sailor. He sailed to many ports 90


in the Mediterranean. During those years, Cabot worked as a merchant. 101


He lived in Venice, but he traded all around the Mediterranean. 112


Columbus spent many hours studying maps. In 1485, he came up 123


with a bold plan. He believed he could reach the Indies by sailing west. 137


Columbus set out to find a king who would pay for a voyage. He 151


went to see John II, King of Portugal. John said no. Columbus kept 164


trying. He presented his plan to other kings, including Henry VII 175


of England. Finally, he found a sponsor. King Ferdinand and Queen 186


Isabella of Spain agreed to pay for a voyage. 195


Unit 8
**328**


Student Name Date


Columbus set sail in 1492. He did not make it to the Indies. He ran 210


into North America. But Columbus did not realize this. He believed he 222


had reached the Indies. 226


In 1494, Cabot learned about Columbus and his journeys. Cabot 236


had studied maps, too. He thought Columbus had made a mistake. 247


He had sailed west in the middle latitudes, near the equator. But that 260


is where the distance around Earth is greatest. Why sail there? Why 272


take the long way? Why not sail farther north? The distance around the 285


Earth would be much shorter there. It would be a better way of sailing 299


to the Indies. 302


Cabot had an idea. He thought he could beat Columbus at his own 315


game. He drew up a plan. Then, he went looking for a sponsor, just as 330


Columbus had done. 333


Cabot looked for funding in Portugal. He was turned down. 343


He went to Henry VII of England. Henry had turned down 354


Columbus, but he liked the sound of Cabot’s plan. He agreed to 366


sponsor a voyage. 369


For the next few years, both men were busy exploring. 379


Lesson 14 Unit Assessment
**329**


Student Name Date


Columbus made three more voyages for Spain. He explored the 389


Caribbean Sea and the coast of South America. 397


Cabot made three voyages for England. He explored the coast of 408


North America. 410


There were many similarities between these two men. But there 420


was one big difference. Columbus ended up famous. Cabot did not. 431


In fact, for many years, Cabot was almost forgotten. Even today, 442


historians are still digging up facts about Cabot. The world has never 454


forgotten about Christopher Columbus, but it had to be reminded 464


about John Cabot. 467

**Spelling Analysis Directions**


- Students are likely to write the incorrect form of /f/:


   - For ‘f’, students may write ‘ff’, ‘ph’, or ‘gh’.


   - For ‘ff’, students may write ‘f’, ‘ph’, or ‘gh’.


   - For ‘ph’, students may write ‘f’, ‘ff’, or ‘gh’.


   - For ‘gh’, students may write ‘f’, ‘ff’, or ‘ph’.


- While the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should be aware

that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find it helpful to

record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the analysis chart.

For example:


   - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


   - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


   - Is the student consistently making errors on particular

beginning consonants?


   - Did the student write words for each feature correctly?


- Also, examine the dictated sentences for errors in capitalization

and punctuation.

###### **Sailors Needed!**





“Crew needed! Sailors needed! Gold, silver, and endless

adventure!” _Clang! Clang!_ The mariner continued along the

street, shouting and ringing a large bell. Young boys followed

him, and behind the boys were several dogs and chickens

whose naps had been rudely disturbed. “Crew needed! Sailors

needed! Leaving in two days!”


Juan and Wilfredo stared after the mariner as the hubbub

faded. _Endless adventure_ . . .





Wilfredo tugged at Juan’s sleeve. “Juan! You’re a thousand miles away.”


“I wish,” said Juan. “Have you ever thought of sailing, Wilfredo?”


“No,” said Wilfredo, laughing. “Absolutely not. Why would anyone want to? The crews on half of

those ships wind up needing to be rescued. The other half of them don’t find anything useful.

Everything’s salty and damp. Everyone gets seasick. You’re stuck wearing a stiff, stinking uniform.”


“But you could find gold,” Juan argued. “They say there’s a whole city of gold! Think of it, Wilfredo!

You could find spices like cumin, perfume, or silks in every hue.”


“Bah,” said Wilfredo. “What use is gold? Oh, it’s beautiful, sure. But no one has ever built a city

of it. You know the issue with gold? It’s heavy, and it’s soft—two things you don’t want building

materials to be. Your city of gold is just a rumor.”


The mariner’s bell echoed from a neighboring street. Juan fell into a thoughtful silence, musing.


“Stay here,” said Wilfredo. “Learn to make shoes, like I do. You have to occupy your time somehow.

You might as well be of use to the world.”


“I do have to occupy my time somehow,” said Juan. “And of course shoes are useful. But . . .

Wilfredo, I want to see and explore the world before I decide to stay in one place.”


“Suit yourself, of course,” said Wilfredo, just as a delicious smell of stew reached them from a

nearby window. “For me, this place has amusement enough.”


Two days later, just as the sun rose, Juan stepped onto the deck of the ship. He had never left his

town before. He would never see it the same way again.

###### **Coronado Describes Hawikuh to the** **King of Spain**





Perched on his throne, the King of Spain was surrounded by his

advisors. He faced Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, who had

just made a proposal to the king. “It seems terribly risky.” The

king, who did not trust Francisco, raised an eyebrow and looked

at his advisors. He knew they were shrewd and would tell him

what they thought of Francisco’s plan.


Francisco did not want to lose his opportunity to persuade the

king. “Your Majesty, Friar Marcos saw the place. He swore to





**342**



witnessing the city of El Dorado. The people there call it Hawikuh.”


“Yes,” piped up his clerk Diego. “Yes, that’s true. They do. Hawikuh.”


“Hush, Diego,” hissed Francisco. Feeling guilty, Diego hung his head and chewed on his lip.


“You talk of gold,” said the king as he threw a disapproving glance at the maps strewn across the

advisors’ table. “You talk of riches. You don’t talk of the men who died after claiming to see the place.”


Francisco coughed. “Some misunderstandings are—ahem—bound to happen when two groups of

people meet each other.”


“Nearly fifty years!” an advisor shouted from behind the king. “For nearly fifty years, Spain has

sent ships, armies, food, and supplies to the New World, always with the promise of gold, gold,

and more gold. What have we gained? Shipwrecks and, as you say, misunderstandings.”


“We have never had a lookout like Friar Marcos,” said Francisco.


“That proves nothing,” hissed the advisor. “You want the crown to set you loose with even more

resources when there’s no proof—” The king held up a jeweled hand, and the advisor stopped

speaking. The throne room filled with an uncomfortable silence.


“Tell them, sir,” murmured Diego.


“Don’t tell me what to do,” snapped Francisco, just as the king said, “Tell us what?”


Francisco coughed again. “I am prepared to—ahem—invest a large amount of my own money in

this expedition.”


The king’s mouth grew into a smile. “Your own money! Ah, then, sir, Spain will give you support. And

we look forward to the report that you have claimed this El Dorado, this Hawikuh, for New Spain.”

###### **A Tale of Mutiny on Henry Hudson’s** **Last Voyage**





“Sausage pie,” said Stefan, seeming to see something far off in

the distance. “That’s what I’ll eat first. Steaming hot, full of egg

and cheese . . . a flaky, buttery crust . . .”


“Stop,” moaned Ralph. “It’s too much to think about.”


Stefan laughed. “If you’re hungry, Ralph, there’s plenty more

dried fish. There’s enough of that to go around forever.”


Peter wrinkled his nose. “Don’t I know it! It’s foul stuff. I’ll never

get that smell out of my nose.”





“Fine, then,” said Stefan. “What will you eat, Peter, when you’re back in Amsterdam?”


“Fresh figs,” said Peter, looking as though he had just seen the love of his life. “Have you ever

tasted them? They’re like honey turned into fruit. Most figs don’t grow in the land so far north, but

my folks have a tree, in a warm part of the garden, where the walls keep the leaves safe. You can

eat the fruit right off the tree. It’s fantastic.”


Before Stefan could respond, the three of them were flung to the wooden deck. The ship had

crashed hard against a bank of ice. For days they had been sailing slowly and carefully between

the floating chunks. A rough-edged iceberg could easily tear a hole in the side of the ship and

leave them stranded in the frozen lands at the top of the world.


Peter lifted his head. “Is everyone all right?” he asked.


“Fine enough,” said Stefan, pushing himself up and fighting for balance. Half the ship seemed to

be on top of the ice, and the deck was tilted.


“Oof,” muttered Ralph. He had landed face down, and a large piece of dried fish was stuck to his beard.


The door to the cabin fell open, and Captain Hudson staggered out, doing his best to appear

confident while walking across the slippery floor. “Well!” he said. “We’ve found an ice bank,

haven’t we? Best to hop off and push with some oars until the bottom of the ship is back in the

water. Then we can sail northward.”

For a moment, his phrases hung in the air. Everyone on the deck was silent. Ralph was staring at

Hudson, fuming, flakes of fish slowly falling off of his face.


“Come on now,” said Hudson. “If we stay here, the sheet of floating ice will freeze solid. Over the

side! Hurry up!” He clapped his gloved hands for emphasis.


Ralph spoke then, and his voice was even more frigid than the Arctic air. “ _You_ can go over the

side,” he said. “ _We_ have gone far enough north.”
