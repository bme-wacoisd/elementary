## **Introduction to** **_The Age of Exploration_**

In 1491, most Europeans did not know that North
and South America existed. The people of the Americas
did not know that Europe existed. Although other
**explorers** had visited the Americas before, Europeans
did not know that.


In 1492, that changed. In that year, Christopher
Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and
happened to land on islands off the coast of the
Americas. His **explorations** marked the start of the
Age of **Exploration** .

As news spread about what Columbus had found,
men from all over Spain raced to find treasure. Spanish
**conquistadors**, such as Francisco Vasquez de Coronado,
set out in search of silver and gold. They slashed their
way through swamps. They marched across deserts. They
**explored** and conquered many lands.


A few years later, other European countries got
involved. John Cabot went **exploring** for England.
Henry Hudson **explored** for England and for the
Netherlands. Samuel de Champlain **explored** for France.


These **explorers** changed the world. They uncovered
land that was new to Europeans. But they also impacted
the Native populations in the Americas, who had been
living there for thousands of years. You will read about
some of their journeys here.

**Chapter**
## **[The Lure ]** **of Spices**
# **1**

Many European **explorers** were hoping to find gold
and other precious metals.


You can probably understand why **explorers** were
eager to find gold. Gold is a valuable metal even today.
However, you may be surprised to learn that many
**explorers** were also excited about finding **spices** . You
might be saying, “ **Spices** ? Really? Why were they so
eager to find **spices** ?”


Here’s the answer: Things that are scarce, or hard to
find, tend to be expensive. That’s why gold is expensive
today. That’s also why **spices** were expensive five
hundred years ago. Back then, **spices** were scarce in
Europe. They were hard to find. So they cost a lot. Some
**spices** were almost worth their weight in gold.

_**Spices**_ _displayed in a_ _**spice**_ _market_


The red balls in the center of this image are red
peppercorns. A cook can add a few whole peppercorns
to soup. They can use a spice grinder to grind the
peppercorns into tiny bits. Either way, the pepper will
add flavor to the soup. It will make the soup spicier
and tastier.


To the left of the red peppercorns, you can see white
peppercorns. These come from the same plants as red
peppercorns but they are prepared in a different way.
White peppercorns start out as red peppercorns but the
outer hull of the red peppercorn is removed to reveal the
inner kernel, which is white. They can be used in the
same way as red peppercorns.



8


The black bowl in the upper right of this image is
filled with cloves. Cloves are dried flower buds. They are
used to add flavor to meats and stews, some teas, and
pumpkin pie. Cloves are very strong. Cooks who use
them must be careful because adding too many of them
may **overwhelm** other flavors in the dish.


Peppercorns can’t be grown in Europe. They can only

shows unharvested peppercorns.


Today, we can get peppercorns from
India pretty easily. An airplane or a ship
can transport large amounts of them.
You can go to a grocery store and get
almost any **spice** you want. A little jar
of cloves might cost a dollar or two.
A can of peppercorns might cost five or
six dollars.


Five hundred years ago, Europeans
were not so lucky. The world was not
as well-connected as it is today. **Spices**
were hard to get and transport. They
cost a lot of money.


A Spaniard who wanted pepper
_Unharvested_
would have to pay for a lot more
_peppercorns_

than just the pepper. He would have to pay the cost of
shipping the pepper over land all the way from India,
using donkeys, mules, and camels.


It was the same with cloves and cinnamon. These
plants could not be grown in Europe. They had to be
**imported**, or brought in, to Europe from faraway places,
like the Indies.


Many of the **spices** we use are the flowers, the fruits,
or the seeds of the plant. Cinnamon is different. In this
case, the part of the plant we use is the bark. Strips of
bark are cut off the tree. The outer bark is cut away.
The inner bark is kept and rolled up like little scrolls.
These are called cinnamon sticks. Cinnamon can also be
ground up, like pepper.


Do you like the taste of cinnamon? Do you like
cinnamon on toast? How much do you like it? Would
you be willing to sail across an ocean to get some
cinnamon for your toast? In a sense, that is what
European **explorers** were trying to do.

**Chapter**
## **Toscanelli’s Map**
# **2**

An Italian man named Paolo [pow-loe] Toscanelli

[tos-kəh-nel-ee] may have been responsible for the
Europeans landing in the Americas.


Toscanelli was a math **whiz**, an astronomer, and a
mapmaker. In 1474, he made a map of the world, which
he sent with a letter to the King of Portugal telling how
to reach the Indies by sailing west. The King was very
interested but Toscanelli was not correct.


On the right side of Toscanelli’s map, you can see
some parts of Europe in orange. You may know some of
them: Ireland, labeled “Irlanda;” London, England; and
Lisbon, Portugal, labeled “Lisbona.”


To the south of Europe, you can see part of
Africa. The part Europeans called Guinea is labeled.
The Canary Islands, just off the coast of Africa, are
labeled “Canariae.”


12


13


Look at the left side of the map. This side shows
parts of Asia, or, rather, it shows parts of Asia where
Toscanelli thought they might be.


Do you see the big island labeled “Cippangu”?
That was what Toscanelli and other Europeans called
Japan. They had heard about Japan. They knew it was
somewhere in Asia. But they did not know exactly
where. Toscanelli put it on his map where he thought
it might be.


Do you see the land labeled “Cathay Mangi”? That
was what Toscanelli and others of his day called China.
They had read about China in a book called _The Travels_
_of Marco Polo_ . But they did not know exactly where it
was. Again, the map shows where Toscanelli thought
China was, not where it really is.


Do you see the islands just south of Cathay Mangi?
Those are parts of the Indies. They are the “ **spice**
islands” that Europeans were so eager to reach.


14


15


Notice that Asia does not seem to be too far from
Europe. That was one of Toscanelli’s big ideas. He
thought Earth was not that big. He thought Asia was
probably not too far from Europe. So that’s how he drew
it on his map.


Now, imagine you are Christopher Columbus. You
want to find a way to get to the Indies. You look at
Toscanelli’s map.


“Wow!” you say. “Look at that! Asia is right there. It’s
not so far from Europe. There’s nothing in between but
a little water! It would not be hard to get to Asia! Why, I
could get there in a few weeks. All I would need to do is
sail west!”


We can never be sure what was in Christopher
Columbus’s mind when he first looked at Toscanelli’s
map. We do know he made a plan to travel to the Indies
based on Toscanelli’s map. Then, he set out to find
someone who would pay for his **voyage** . In the end, he
convinced King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain
to pay for it.


16


17


Now, here is the same map with something added.
The light blue shows what is really there, not what
Toscanelli thought was there. You can see the outline of
North America and part of South America.


The orange parts of the map show the Asian lands
Columbus expected to reach. The light blue outline
shows the lands where he actually accidentally landed.


Toscanelli’s map explains a lot. It helps us see
where Columbus got the idea of sailing west to reach
the Indies. It also helps us see why he ran into the
islands of the Caribbean and why he thought he was
close to China.

**Chapter**
## **[Navigation in the ]** **Age of Exploration**
# **3**

Do you ever go on trips with your family? How do
the adults in your family find the places they want to
visit? Do they write down directions? Do they use maps?
Do they look for **landmarks** along the way? Do they
have an electronic device that tells them where to turn?


Early European **explorers** didn’t have most of those
things. Most sailors in those days stayed close to land
and looked for familiar **landmarks** . However, this
would not work for **explorers** . They could not look
for familiar **landmarks** because they were sailing into
unknown waters.


Early **explorers** did have some maps but they were
not always accurate. So how did the **explorers** keep track
of where they were?


20


21


They had several tools that they might have used.
One of them was a **compass** . A **compass** is a very simple
device. It is just a little magnet that sits on a pin so it
can spin. The pointer on the magnet points north. Back
then, nobody knew why. Now, we know it’s because
Earth has a **magnetic field**, which is strongest at the
poles. Magnets are attracted to the **magnetic field** of
the North Pole.


22


**Explorers** also used the stars to keep track of their
position. Sailors in this day used two gadgets. One was
called a quadrant. The other one was called an astrolabe.
The details of how these gadgets work are complicated
but the basic idea is not. The idea is that you can keep
track of your position on Earth by keeping track of
where certain stars appear to be in the night sky. If you


23


Others may have kept track of how far they had
traveled using a **method** called **dead reckoning** .


Here’s how **dead reckoning** worked: a sailor had
a piece of wood that was tied to a rope. The rope was
knotted at regular intervals. There might be a knot
every five feet. The sailor would toss the piece of wood
overboard while the ship was sailing. When the wood hit
the water, the sailor would turn over an **hourglass** .


The sailor or the captain of the ship would then
**watch** to see how much rope was pulled out of the ship
and into the sea. If the ship was going fast, it would
quickly leave the piece of wood behind. It would pull


_**Dead reckoning**_ _helped sailors_
_**keep track**_ _of how fast and how_
_far they had traveled._


_**Explorers**_ _used many tools to help them navigate._


A ship’s captain could use **dead reckoning** to make
an **estimate** of how fast the ship was moving. Then, he
could **estimate** how far the ship would travel in an hour
or a day. He could use a **compass** to know which way he
was heading. He could put all this together to make an
**estimate** of where he was.

**Chapter**
## **[El Castillo ]** **de San Marcos**
# **4**

The building on the right is a fort in St. Augustine,
Florida, where the Spanish **established** a settlement in
1565. While there are other, older European settlements
in North America, it is the oldest continuously **occupied**
European settlement in the 50 states of the United
States. You can visit there today and still see the old
buildings standing.


This fort was built by the Spaniards in the 1600s.
It is called El Castillo de San Marcos. That is its
Spanish name. Its English name is the Castle (or Fort)
of Saint Mark.


26


_The inside of the fort is shaped like a square. On each corner,_
_there is a_ _**bastion**_ _shaped like an arrow. A_ _**bastion**_ _is a raised_
_gun platform. The_ _**bastions**_ _stick out from the fort. They let the_
_Spaniards fire out of the fort in just about any direction._



27


El Castillo de San Marcos was not the first fort the
Spaniards built in St. Augustine. They built seven or
eight forts before they built this one. But these earlier
forts were made of wood and were not very strong. Some
of them were destroyed in wars. Others were wrecked
by hurricanes. In 1672, the Spaniards decided to build a
new fort. This time, they decided they would use stone
to make it strong.


28


_A_ _**bastion**_



29


Can you guess what the walls of El Castillo de San
Marcos are made of? Believe it or not, they are made
of seashells! The Spaniards used a kind of rock called
coquina. Coquina is a mixture of fossils and seashells.


Look at the stone on the right. It is coquina. Can
you see the seashells? Those shells are the remains of tiny
animals that lived in the sea long, long ago.


The Spaniards found coquina along the Florida
seashore. They used it to build the fort.


Coquina turned out to be a good stone for building
forts. It is softer than other rocks. That means it does not
crack or **shatter** when cannonballs hit it. A cannonball
might make a dent in a coquina wall or it might be
absorbed into the wall. But, in most cases, it would not
crack the wall.


30


_Coquina_



31


The fort was surrounded by a moat. It is no longer
filled with water. It is now a dry moat.


There was only one way into the fort. You had to
enter a mini-fort that stood just in front of the main fort.
This mini-fort was called the **ravelin** .


A bridge led from the **ravelin** across the moat and
into the main fort. The last part of this bridge was a
drawbridge. It could be lifted up to keep people from
getting in.


It was not easy to open the drawbridge. It took five
men fifteen minutes to open it.


In this image, you can see the bridge that leads into
the fort. It is on the left.


El Castillo de San Marcos was a strong fortress. It was
attacked many times but it was never captured.

**Chapter**
## **[Hernando ]** **de Soto**
# **5**

On May 30, 1539, the veteran **conquistador**
Hernando de Soto led a group of Spaniards ashore on
the western coast of Florida. De Soto staked a flagpole
into the sandy beach and claimed the land for the king
of Spain on behalf of the Spanish King and Queen who


_Florida_ _**exploration**_ _._

34


De Soto was not the first Spaniard to explore Florida.
Juan Ponce de León had **explored** the area in 1513
and again in 1521, but he had failed to **establish** a
permanent Spanish colony in Florida. Another Spaniard,
Pánfilo de Narváez [pahn-fee-lo de nar-vay-uz], also
tried to **conquer** Florida but did not succeed. Many of
his men died fighting with Natives; others died from
dehydration, being lost at sea, or drowning when a
hurricane hit and sank their boats. In the end, of the
six hundred men who began the **voyage**, only four men
managed to get back to Mexico to tell the tale.


Hernando de Soto knew about the **explorations**
of Ponce de León and Narváez. He knew it would be
dangerous to explore Florida, but he felt he could achieve
more than the men who had **explored** before him. After
all, de Soto had been in Peru with Francisco Pizarro, one
of the most successful of all the **conquistadors**, when
Pizarro captured and held for ransom the Inca Emperor,
Atahualpa [ah-tah-wal-pa]. De Soto had helped
collect the great ransom of silver and gold that made
Pizarro very rich.


And de Soto, too, became a very wealthy man
through his relationship with Pizarro. Hernando de
Soto believed he could make even more money by
**conquering** Florida and gathering up the gold that

35


_Hernando de Soto preparing for the expedition._


was rumored to be there. De Soto invested much of his
own money in his Florida **expedition**, and he prepared
for it carefully. De Soto signed up lots of other experts,
including soldiers, sailors, tailors, shoemakers, engineers,
and priests. Most of the seven hundred men on his
**expedition** were Spaniards, but there were a number of
recruits from other countries in Europe. The **expedition**
sailed from Spain in April of 1538. After a year in Cuba,
de Soto and his men sailed to Florida, arriving at the end
of May in 1539.



36


De Soto sent a **scouting** **party** inland and discovered
an **abandoned** Native village. Finding abandoned
Native villages was not unusual. By this time, many
Native people had learned about the arrival of Spaniards
and many chiefs decided that it would be best to avoid
these strangers, so they **abandoned** their villages.
Sometimes, they would return to the village after the
Spaniards moved away.


De Soto and his men **established** a base in the
**abandoned** village and began to explore the surrounding
land. They made a surprising discovery on their
**exploration** when they found a Spaniard who had been


_Hernando de Soto finding Ortiz at de Soto’s base camp._

37


living among Natives and had learned a little of their
language. His name was Juan Ortiz, and he had been a
member of the **disastrous** Narváez **expedition** . Ortiz’s
life was spared by the Native Americans, and he was
allowed to live amongst them. The Spaniards listened
to his stories and decided to make Ortiz one of their
**translators** .


De Soto left some men near the coast and took some
other men to **explore** inland. He and his men made
their way through swamps and forests. They found more

deserted villages and helped themselves to whatever food
and supplies were left behind. Some Native Americans
fought the Spanish colonists. De Soto fought viciously,
hoping that if the Natives heard how dangerous the
Spaniards were, they wouldn’t continue to fight.


By mid-September, de Soto and his men arrived at
a village called Napituca [na-puh-tue-kah]. The local
chief, Vitachuco [vee-ta-choo-ko], seemed friendly, but
Juan Ortiz told de Soto that this friendliness might be an
act. Ortiz had heard rumors that Vitachuco was plotting
against de Soto.


De Soto decided to take no chances. He attacked
the people of the village and took Vitachuco prisoner.
Vitachuco wasn’t treated as poorly as other prisoners. He
was allowed to keep some of his servants and often ate
with de Soto. De Soto thought that if he kept the chief
happy, Vitachuco and his people would cooperate with
him. This plan seemed to be working, until one night
Vitachuco and his people attacked, in attempt to gain
back control over their village. The Spaniards eventually
won this battle and killed Vitachuco.


39


After that battle, the Spaniards went farther north into
Florida claiming more land and resources. A Native de
Soto took as a prisoner told them of a city to the north in
what is now South Carolina called Cofitachequi, [co-fit-achehkwee] where the chief was a woman who had lots of
gold and pearls.


De Soto and his men went through what is now
Georgia and into what is now north-central South
Carolina, in search of the these treasures. There they met


_De Soto meeting with the Lady of Cofitachequi_


la Señora de Cofitachequi, the Lady of Cofitachequi.
At first, the Lady of Cofitachequi was friendly, allowing
them to stay in her village. She had very little gold, but
she did have some pearls that she gave to the Spaniards
as gifts. Later, despite her generosity, de Soto arrested the
Lady of Cofitachequi, held her hostage, and marched on.


No one is sure what happened to the Lady of
Cofitachequi, but some historians say that she remained
with de Soto and his men for a while until she had a
chance to escape through the woods. The Spaniards
could not track her down because they were **unfamiliar**
with the land. They never saw her again.


De Soto and his men went on a trek north and west
through what is now Georgia and South Carolina, to the
edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains. They passed through
territory controlled by the Mississippians. Everywhere
they went they looked for gold but had very little success.
The de Soto **expedition** eventually reached the area now
known as Alabama. De Soto and his men were on a search
for supplies, land, and gold. On their quest, de Soto and
his men were ambushed by the Native Mississippians. This
resulted in one of de Soto’s biggest battles. They killed
more than two thousand Native Mississippians. Only
twenty-two of de Soto’s men were killed, and two hundred
were injured, including de Soto himself. By November

41


_De Soto’s route with Native territories marked_


of 1540, the de Soto **expedition** had entered into
Mississippian territory in northeastern Mississippi. They
spent the winter in what they thought was an **abandoned**
Native village. However, the Native Mississippians attacked
De Soto’s men by firing flaming arrows. The Spaniards
managed to escape with the help of their stampeding
horses, which scared off some of the Native people.


With all of the constant marching and fighting,
De Soto’s men grew very tired and were ready to go
home. They no longer believed that there was much
gold to be found in these parts of America. Some of


42


them began to plan a **mutiny** against de Soto. De Soto,
however, did not want to give up and go home empty
handed. He pushed his men on. They marched and
fought their way west.


In May of 1541, they reached the mighty Mississippi
River. De Soto and his men constructed flatboats to
carry the men and horses, and crossed the river at night
to hide from the Natives.


_De Soto crossing the Mississippi_


After de Soto and his men crossed the Mississippi
River, they **explored** what is now Arkansas. They met
Natives near what is now Camden, Arkansas, who lived
in tipis and hunted bison. De Soto and his men spent
the winter there.


By the spring of 1542, even de Soto was starting to
lose faith and energy in his quest for riches. De Soto had
found almost no gold. He had lost many of his men, and
his horses could barely walk. His **translator**, Juan Ortiz,
had died, and the other **translators** were having trouble
understanding the local Natives.


In May of 1542, de Soto came down with a bad
fever. He spent his days in bed, but the fever got worse.
He finally died on May 21, 1542. According to legend,
de Soto’s men attached stones to his body and then sank
it in the Mississippi River, so that the Native Americans
would not find it and realize that de Soto had told them
a lie about being immortal, or able to live forever.


The remaining men of the de Soto **expedition** made
their way back to the Gulf of Mexico where they built
seven boats. In July of 1543, they floated along the Gulf
Coast, past Texas, and eventually made their way back
to the Spanish **outposts** in Mexico. Throughout this


44


difficult journey, the men on the de Soto **expedition**
were the first known Europeans to explore the
southeastern United States north and west of present
day Florida.

## **[Coronado Reports ]** **to the King**
# **6**

Francisco Vasquez de Coronado was a Spanish
**conquistador** . He **explored** what is now the American
Southwest in search of the Seven Cities of Cibola [SEEboe-lə], which were said to have streets paved with gold.
During the trip, Coronado wrote letters to the King of
Spain. In his second letter, written in October of 1541,
he described his march across the Great **Plains** of Texas,
including modern-day Amarillo, and then to Oklahoma
to Quivira [Kee-VEE-rə], in modern-day Kansas. Here is
a quote from his original letter:


“After nine days’ march I reached some plains, so
vast that I did not find their limit anywhere that I went,
although I traveled over them for more than 300 leagues.
And I found such a quantity of cows in these, of the kind
that I wrote Your Majesty about, which they have in this
country, that it is impossible to number them, for while
I was journeying through these plains, until I returned to
where I first found them, there was not a day that I lost
sight of them.”

46

47


In the rest of the letter he told the king about the
Native people he and his men met. He also described the
bison they saw, which he called “cows.” On the pages that
follow is an edited version of Coronado’s letter.

## **[Spanish ]** **Settlements**
# **7**

As the Age of the **Conquistadors** was coming to an
end, many Spanish explorers realized that the fabulous
riches they hoped to find were nowhere to be found.
The **expeditions** of de Soto and Coronado ended
unsuccessfully, and while Coronado made it back to Spain,
he was discouraged after losing the large **investment** he
made in his expedition trying to find wealth. Instead,


56


the colonies they had already established farther south in
the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America. However, they
kept a close watch on their North American colonies by
building forts to protect their ships and settlers.


The Spaniards sent missionaries who worked to
introduce the Native people to Christianity and convince
them to adopt European ways of living. Pedro Menéndez,
the first Spanish colonial governor of Florida, was an
important influence in having missionaries brought to North
America. Menéndez insisted that any ships coming from
Spain must include a priest who could serve as a missionary.


The Spanish missionaries made many contributions to
American culture by sharing their faith with Spanish settlers
and Native Americans. They built many church buildings in
early America, also known as **missions**, that are some of the
oldest buildings still standing in the United States today.


In the 1590s, the Spaniards began establishing
missions in what is known as the Southwest, including
the states we now call New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas.
Many American cities in the Southwest began as missions.
Some examples include San Diego, San Francisco, San
Jose, and Santa Barbara in California as well as San
Antonio in Texas.


Every mission was centered around a church.
Missionaries would often live in one building. The Native
Americans would live within the mission in their own
houses. Most missions also included **orchards** and farms
where they raised cattle, sheep, and other animals. Most
missions also had bakeries, craft shops, and storerooms for
the crops grown on the farms and orchards. The Native
Americans that the Spaniards encountered already had
many skills of their own, including farming, hunting,
weaving, pottery making, and weather tracking. However,
once Native Americans lived in the missions, the Spanish
taught them other skills such as woodworking, soap
making, and candle making.


In the missions, the Native people attended a school
where they received instruction from priests who taught
about Spanish customs, Catholicism, and the Bible. Adults
and children were taught to read, write, and speak in
Spanish in an effort to **integrate** Native Americans into


58


_Spanish mission_


Spanish culture, tradition, and faith. As time went on, the
younger generations began growing up immersed in Spanish
culture and adopted the language, style of clothing, and
cultural traditions taught to them by the missionaries.


From 1682 to 1793, many missions were **established**
across Texas. However, not all of them were successful in
establishing thriving communities. Many Native American
tribes in the southwest were **nomadic**, which meant they
often traveled with the seasons or to follow food sources.
This meant they weren’t interested in settling down on a
permanent Spanish mission. However, there were many
successful missions in Texas, such as the ones established
in San Antonio, Texas. Does the Alamo ring a bell? The
Alamo and four other missions built in the 1700s still
have an influence on the culture of the city. Mission San


59


_Spanish mission_


Jose, Mission San Juan, Mission Espada, and Mission
Concepción were all built in the same area near the San
Antonio River. These missions are the largest number of
Spanish missions in one spot in North America.


Spanish missionaries in San Antonio were successful in
integrating Native Americans into the mission community.
The San Antonio Missions consisted of multiple churches,
granaries, workshops, ranches, and fields with irrigation
systems. By the 1700s, many Native Americans in the area
spoke Spanish and practiced Christianity. Another success
was Mission Espiritu Santo in Goliad, Texas, which became
the first large Texas cattle ranch. The cattle and crops raised
in the mission were used to trade with other missions in
East Texas and Louisiana.

60


Mission Ysleta, located in El Paso, Texas, is one of
the most well-known missions. In 1682, Antonio de
Otermín, Fray Francisco de Ayeta, and members of the
Tigua Native American tribe helped build the original
mission church from logs and reeds. Ysleta became a
community meeting place because of its close location to
the Rio Grande River. Ysleta was unique because of how
well the Spanish and Tigua Native Americans were able
to combine their cultures. Even today, it is known as the
oldest continuously occupied settlement in Texas.


Around the same time these communities were being
built, a Spanish leader named José de Escandón began
founding towns and missions along the Rio Grande
Valley. Because of his large impact on this area, he is
known as the Father of the Lower Rio Grande Valley. In


_An old Spanish mission building_




1746, Escandón was sent by the viceroy of Mexico (or
New Spain) to inspect the area between Tampico and
the San Antonio River and develop a plan to colonize
it. He was made governor and captain general of the
colony Nuevo Santander. Under Escandón’s plan, he had
a budget for the community and five hundred pesos for
each colonist who agreed to move to these new towns.
It was advertised in many areas and attracted a number
of colonists and allies. Escandón brought in many
**blacksmiths**, carpenters, and **artisans**, which helped


62


these communities succeed. Between 1748 and 1755, he
founded over twenty towns and missions across the area.


As the United States gained more territory in North
America, most of the Spanish missions were abandoned.
However, a few of them still operate today throughout
Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. Many
have been recognized as World Heritage Sites, which
means they have been designated as important cultural
landmarks. If you ever head to the Southwest, check out
some of these historical markers located in cities like El
Paso, San Diego, and Tucson.

## **John Cabot**
# **8**

John Cabot (known as Giovanni Caboto [JEE-oeVO-nee CA-bu-toe] in his native Italy) had the same
dream as Columbus: to reach Asia by sailing west.
However, unlike Columbus, Cabot thought the best
chance of reaching Asia would be to sail around the
northern part of Earth, where the distance around
would be **substantially** shorter than the distance at the
**equator** . Cabot, like other **explorers**, wanted to find the
Northwest Passage, which was thought to be a shorter
route west from Europe to Asia. Finding a shorter route
to Asia meant finding a shorter route to **spices** .


Many details of Cabot’s life and **voyages** are
unknown. He did not keep records during his **voyages**
nor was much written about his life. However, it
is known that he was Italian and had support from
King Henry VII of England for his **voyages** . King
Henry VII gave Cabot a **charter** to explore and claim
land for England.


64


_John Cabot_



65


Cabot made his first attempt to find the Northwest
Passage in 1496. This attempt was a failure. He had a
disagreement with some members of his crew. There
was also a shortage of food and he ran into bad weather.
Cabot decided to turn back for England.


Cabot tried again in 1497, with a single ship and
a crew of 18. This time, he reached land, which he
thought was Asia. However, this land turned out to be
the coast of North America. It is not known exactly
where he first sighted land, though. It may have been
the coast of Newfoundland. Cabot spent a short time
**exploring** the coast and it is possible that he sailed as far
south as the Chesapeake Bay. During this **voyage**, Cabot
found a large area of shallow water that was abundant
with fish. This area, known as the Grand Banks, is
still one of the best fishing areas in the world today. At
any rate, Cabot and his men became one of the first
European **expeditions** to see the **landmass** now known
as North America.


66


_The circled area is the Grand Banks._



67


Cabot sailed back to England with his news. Certain
that he had found a new, shorter route to Asia, Cabot
gained support for another, much larger **expedition** .
This **expedition** left England in 1498, but it never
returned. Nobody knows for certain what happened
to Cabot and his men. In time, it became clear that
Cabot had not, in fact, located the Northwest Passage.
However, England based its later claims to North
American territory on Cabot’s **explorations** . When
Cabot had first sighted land, he had gone ashore and
claimed it for England. Cabot’s **exploration** began
England’s desire to **explore** and create settlements in
North America.


Do you think you could be a sailor on Cabot’s ship?
Here is a description of what it might be like to be a
young sailor.


On a ship, young boys served as **pages** . On land,
a **page** worked for a knight. At sea, he worked for a
captain. **Pages** did all sorts of odd jobs. They carried
messages, mopped the deck, helped pass out food, and
cleaned up after meals.


Older boys might be asked to work the **bilge pumps** .
Even the best ships sometimes sprang a leak. If a ship
leaked too much, it might sink. To keep that from
happening, sailors had to **pump** water out of the ship
using a **bilge pump** . This was a terrible job. The **bilge**

sailors sick.


After pumping **bilge**
water all day, it would
have been great to sit
down to a nice, warm
meal. Unfortunately,
sailors did not get many
warm meals. For most
meals, they got **hardtack** .


69


**Hardtack** was a kind of bread that was baked over
and over. **Hardtack** was so hard, it was tough to eat.
Sailors had to soak it in a drink to soften it up. The
good thing about **hardtack**, though, was that it would
not **spoil** on a long **voyage** . It was so hard, bugs had
trouble getting into it—unless it got wet. Once it got
wet, weevils and other bugs could and did get into it.
But you could usually see them and brush them off with
your fingers.


If a **voyage** was going well, sailors might get other
kinds of food. They might get a little salted meat now
and then. They might get some fish or a few beans. But
if supplies were running low, they might get nothing
but **hardtack** .


The diet on sailing ships was so bad that many
sailors got sick. Lots of them got a disease called **scurvy** .
Today, we know now that **scurvy** is caused by a lack of
vitamin C, found in fresh fruits and vegetables. In the
Age of **Exploration**, people did not know this. So many
sailors died.


70


_**Hardtack**_



71


After a long day of work, sailors were ready to fall
into bed and rest their aching bones. They were ready—
but there were no beds for them to fall into. The captain
had a bed to sleep in, but the sailors did not. They slept
on the deck. As the ship rolled back and forth with the
waves, the sailors rolled with it.


Most sailors had to stand **watch** for part of the night.
When that was done, they could sleep for a few hours. In
the morning, they would get up and do it all over again.
A sailor’s day started bright and early.


So, what do you think? Does a sailor’s life sound
good to you?

**Chapter**
## **Henry Hudson**
# **9**

John Cabot was not the only person who wanted to
find a Northwest Passage to the Indies. English explorer
Henry Hudson had the same goal. Very little is known
about Henry Hudson’s early life, but we do know he had
an interest in **exploring** Arctic geography.


Hudson made his first attempt to find the Northwest
Passage in 1607, more than a hundred years after Cabot
made his **voyages** . Hudson’s idea about how he might


74


get to the Indies was similar to Cabot’s. Hudson’s idea
was to sail north, right over the North Pole. He knew the
polar region was cold and icy, but he also knew that the
sun never set during the summer months. He thought
the summer sun might melt a lot of the ice, making it
possible to sail over the top of the earth and come out on
the other side of the world in Asia.


In May of 1607, Hudson **embarked** from England
with a single ship called the _Hopewell_ . Six weeks later
his men sighted the eastern coast of Greenland. Hudson
sailed along the eastern coast of Greenland and then
turned and sailed northeast because there was so
much ice. During their **voyage**, he and his men saw
many **unfamiliar** creatures, including whales, seals,
and walruses.


75


In mid-July they reached the Spitsbergen
**archipelago** [ahr-kuh-pel-uh-goh] which is a chain of
islands that has an arctic climate. When Hudson tried to
**navigate** this region, it was surrounded by pack ice, or
frozen seawater. On May 16, Hudson’s ship almost got
stuck in the ice. For a while, it was “touch and go.” A few
days later, Hudson decided he could not reach the North
Pole because of all the ice. He turned around and sailed
back to England.


In 1608, Hudson made a second attempt to reach the
East Indies by sailing the _Hopewell_ across the North Pole.
He sailed north of Scandinavia and Russia. He sailed
more than two thousand five hundred miles, making it
to the islands off the coast of Russia known as Novaya
Zemlya (“New Land”). But again, there was so much ice
in the water that he had to turn back.


In 1609, Hudson made a third attempt to find the
Northwest Passage. This time he sailed for the Dutch
under the Dutch East India Company. The Dutch East
India Company was a **trading company** that formed to
protect their **trade** in what was called the East Indies.
The company hired Hudson and told him to follow a
similar route he had attempted on his previous **voyage**,
sailing north of Scandinavia and Russia. The hope
was that he would be able to sail over the top of the

76


earth and land in Asia. Hudson left Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, in April of 1609, onboard the Dutch ship,
the _Half Moon_ . As he made his way north, he saw more
and more ice. Eventually, there was so much ice that
Hudson decided to give up and turn around in mid-May.


Instead of sailing back to Amsterdam, as he had
been told to do, Hudson decided to sail west. Hudson
sailed across the Atlantic and sighted Newfoundland on
July 12. He sailed along the coast of North America,
**exploring** much of what is now the east coast of United
States. He and his men sailed as far south as Virginia,
where the Jamestown settlement had recently been
**established** . Then they turned north.



77


_Hudson sailing upriver_


On September 3, they came upon a large river
that emptied into the Atlantic. Hudson and his men
**explored** the river, sailing upstream. When Hudson
saw the river widening out, he thought the river he
was **exploring** might be the Northwest Passage that he
and **explorers** before him had been seeking for years.
Farther upstream, the river **narrowed**, and Hudson
began to think maybe it would not lead him through
the continent. Nevertheless, it was an interesting
discovery. Hudson claimed the area for the Netherlands
and the Dutch.



78


Hudson and his crew encountered many Native
Americans of the **Algonquian** -speaking tribes on their
trip up the river. Some Native Americans tried to attack
them but others visited the ship to **trade** . The Natives
offered furs to Hudson in **trade**, and this started the
fur **trade** along the Hudson River. One group invited
Hudson to dinner. Later, Hudson described what he had
experienced in his journal:


“I sailed to the shore in one of their canoes, with an
old man who was the chief of a tribe consisting of forty
men and seventeen women. These I saw there, in a house
well-constructed of oak bark, and circular in shape, so


that it had the appearance of being built with an arched
roof. It contained a great quantity of maize or Indian
corn, and beans of the last year’s growth; and there lay
near the house, for the purpose of drying, enough to
load three ships, besides what was growing in the fields.
On our coming into the house, two mats were spread
out to sit upon, and some food was immediately served
in well-made red wooden bowls.


Two men . . . brought in a pair of pigeons, which
they had shot. . . They supposed that I would remain
with them for the night; but I returned, after a short
time, on board the ship. The land is the finest for
**cultivation** that I ever in my life set foot upon, and it
also **abounds** in trees of every description. These Natives
are a very good people; for when they saw that I would
not remain, they supposed that I was afraid of their
bows; and, taking their arrows, they broke them in pieces
and threw them into the fire.”


In late September, Hudson decided to sail back to
Europe. He himself wanted to stay in the Americas for
the winter, but his men were tired of **exploring** and were
threatening to **mutiny** .


The river Hudson discovered on his third **voyage**
was later named after him. Even today it is known as


80


the Hudson River. Other Dutchmen came to this part
of the world after Hudson. They built a city at the
mouth of the Hudson River, on an island the Natives
called Mannahatta. The Dutch called this city New
Amsterdam. Later its name was changed to New York.
Today, Manhattan is the name of one of the parts of
New York City and New York City is the most populous
city in the United States.


In 1610, Hudson set off on a fourth **voyage** . This
time he was sponsored by two English companies—the
Virginia Company and the British East India Company.
Similar to the Dutch East India Company, these
companies were also **trading companies** . Hudson’s goal
was the same: to find a Northwest Passage, a water route
that would lead through the American continent and
allow ships to sail to Asia.



81


_Map of fourth_ _**voyage**_


Hudson sailed west, but he stayed far to the north.
He reached Greenland in early June. A few weeks later he
and his men found a large **strait** that led into the center
of North America. Hudson hoped it might lead all the
way through to Asia.


On August 2, Hudson sailed out of the **strait** and
into a large bay. Today this bay is known as the Hudson
Bay, and the **strait** is known as the Hudson **Strait** .
Hudson spent the next few months **exploring** the
coast of the bay.


82


In November, his ship got stuck in the ice. He
and his crew had to go ashore for the winter. It was a
difficult, freezing cold winter. The men were fighting
with Hudson as well as with one another. Several of
them fell ill with **scurvy**, a disease that preys on people
who have not been eating a healthy, balanced diet.


When spring came, Hudson wanted to **explore** some
more. Most of the men on the ship wanted to sail back
to England. A big fight broke out.


In the end, the sailors **mutinied** . They put Hudson,
his son, and some others they did not like in a small,
open boat and sailed away. Henry Hudson, the great
**explorer**, was never heard from again.




**Chapter**
# **10**


## **[Samuel de ]** **Champlain**



84


a two-year **expedition** to the West Indies and Central
America. The son of a sea captain, he was not born into
high social **status** in France, but his accomplishments
as a **navigator** and talented mapmaker earned him an
**honorary** title of “royal geographer” from King Henry IV
in his court.


In 1603, Champlain was invited to sail in a French
fur- **trading expedition** to an area known at the time as
“New France” in present-day Canada. Decades before
Champlain’s **expeditions**, in 1534, a French **navigator**
and **explorer**, Jacques Cartier, claimed the shores of the
St. Lawrence River, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the
areas now known as Newfoundland and Nova Scotia in
honor of France. Cartier’s attempt to colonize an area
around present-day Quebec failed at that time, but these
**explorations** were only the beginning of a fur- **trading**
relationship between France and the Natives in the area
of “New France.”


The goal of Champlain’s 1603 **expedition** was to
**trade** with the Native people in the area of “New France”
and return home with beaver **pelts** and other furs that
could be sold in France. During this **voyage**, Champlain
talked to fur **traders** and fishermen and met Native
people of the areas he visited. He made a map of the
St. Lawrence River, a long river that flows away from the

85


_Champlain on fur trading expedition_


Great Lakes and empties into the Atlantic Ocean. When
he returned home to France, Champlain published a
report on his **expedition** .


By 1604, Champlain took part in an attempt to
start a French colony in “New France” with a small
group of colonists. They suffered a difficult winter
in their original settlement near the mouth of the St.
Croix River, during which almost half of the colonists
died. After Champlain and a few men **scouted** the
surrounding area, the surviving colonists moved to the
area presently known as Nova Scotia. This colonization



86


attempt was not a success, but Champlain took this
time to explore and map areas along the Atlantic coast,
eventually sailing as far south as Cape Cod.


After **exploring** several possible locations along the
northeastern Atlantic coast, Champlain decided that the
best place for a French colony was along the St. Lawrence
River. Champlain **envisioned** this colony becoming a
control center for the fur **trade** . This was a sign of an
important change in the way Europeans thought about
North America. John Cabot and Henry Hudson had
been trying to find a way to go around America, or a


_Map of St. Lawrence River colony with maps of routes_
_around America_


way to go through it. They were not especially interested
in America and its resources. They were interested in
goods from Asia and what was called the East Indies, such
as **spices** and silk. They thought of America as something
that was blocking their way. With Champlain, there was
a new way of thinking.


Champlain was still interested in finding a Northwest
Passage. He went on several **expeditions** where that was
an important goal. But he and many of the men who
came after him began to think of North America not just


88


as an obstacle on the path to more **profitable** places, but
as a place that was **profitable** in its own right—and a
place that might be worth settling.


In 1608, Champlain received permission to lead an
**expedition** of three ships and about thirty-two colonists
from France. He sailed up the river and **established** a
settlement, which was named Quebec City. Only nine
of the original colonists, including Champlain, survived
the first cold winter in Quebec City, but more settlers
arrived the following June. At first, Quebec City was
little more than a fort, but Champlain had a dream—he
hoped that Quebec City would be the capital of a large
and prosperous French colony. He spent the rest of his
life working to make that dream a reality.


_Settling Quebec City_




Champlain set up a fur- **trading** station in Quebec
City. Native Americans could bring animal furs to the
city, and French **traders** would buy the furs and ship
them back to France.


To ensure protection for the settlement in Quebec
City, Champlain made an agreement with some of the
tribes who lived along the St. Lawrence, including the
Huron and the **Algonquin** people. He supported these
tribes in a war against the Iroquois, a large group of
tribes who lived to the south in what is now New York
State. Champlain led **expeditions** against the Iroquois
and in 1609, he became the first European to visit the




lake that is now named for him, Lake Champlain. In
1615, he became the first known European to arrive at
the Great Lakes. There was more than just a military
alliance between Champlain and the tribes, however;
they learned things from each other as well. Even the
name of the new city, Quebec, was borrowed from the
**Algonquian** language spoken by many Native Americans
throughout North America. The word Quebec comes
from the **Algonquian** word “ **kebek”** meaning “where the
river **narrows** .” Both the Algonquian and Iroquois tribes
still have thriving cultures, with many of their people
still living in these regions today.


Champlain made several trips to France to **recruit**
new settlers and secure French government support of
his colony. He eventually married and brought his new
wife to settle with him in Quebec City. He also brought
missionaries to “New France” to teach the Native people
about Christianity. The missionaries worked with the
fur **traders** and the settlers to extend French settlements
farther inland. In the end, Champlain was successful.
The colony of Quebec did not just survive; it prospered.
It became the first permanent French settlement on the
continent of North America. The areas that made up
“New France” remained part of the French empire for


91


more than a hundred years and, in time, became part of
a larger country now known as Canada.


Over the last couple of weeks, you have learned
about many European **explorers** and their **expeditions** .
You have learned that they were all so intrigued by stories
of wealth, **spices**, and gold that they decided to **explore**
**unfamiliar** lands and seas. These **explorers** **embarked**
on investigative travels to find answers to their questions.


Now it’s our turn to ask a question: Who was the first
known European to explore America?



92


As you have heard, Christopher Columbus is
the European often credited with “discovering” the
Americas. While searching for a route to the East
Indies, he unintentionally arrived at the islands in the
Caribbean, now known as the West Indies.


John Cabot landed in a part of Canada that we call
Newfoundland. Newfoundland, like the islands of the
Caribbean, were not empty, but filled with people who
inhabited it already.


All of the European **explorers** we’ve learned about—
Columbus, Ponce de León, de Soto, Coronado, de Vaca,
Cabot, Hudson, and Champlain—landed in many
different parts of the Americas, claiming their discoveries


93


in honor of their countries. Without their knowledge,
these explorers made landfall in places in North America
that people were already living. Who were these people?


What do you remember about the Native Americans?
There were millions of Native people in the Americas
when European explorers first arrived.


The Native peoples lived according to their own
customs and cultures, had developed their own farming,
trade, and economic systems, and built great civilizations
in the Americas. Europeans **exploring** and later settling
in the Americas brought with them their own cultures
and curiosity. Unintentionally, explorers brought over
diseases which resulted in the deaths of millions of
Native Americans.


Although we cannot know for sure who were the
first people living in the Americas and when or how they
arrived, what we can say for certain is that the history,
culture, and legacy of both the Native Americans and the
European **explorers** are still evident today.

## **The Fur Trade** **and Samuel de** **Champlain**



Many of the Frenchmen who came to North
America in the 1600s and 1700s were fur **traders** . These
**traders** **traded** with the Native people. They gave them
European goods **in exchange** for animal skins and furs.


The **traders** collected many kinds of fur but they
were most interested in beaver **pelts** . Beaver hats were
**popular** in Europe. You could sell beaver hats in
England, France, Germany, and Russia.


Why were beaver hats so **popular** ? For one thing,





Some hatmakers used the
beaver fur as it was. They
made soft, puffy hats. Others
processed the beaver fur to make


then formed into
hats. **Felt** hats did
not look like they
were made of beaver
fur. But, they were.
In many parts of
Europe, there were no
beavers left. Hunters
had killed too many
of them. The beaver
had almost gone
extinct. Europeans
could not get beaver
**pelts** at home. So,
they were willing to pay for beaver **pelts** **imported** from
North America.


Samuel de Champlain and other Frenchmen took the
lead in the fur **trade** . They set up **trading posts** in North
America. There were **trading posts** along the Atlantic
Coast. There were **trading posts** in Quebec and along
the St. Lawrence River. There were even **trading posts**
farther west, along the shores of the Great Lakes.


On the page that follows is an adaptation of
Champlain’s journey down the River of the Iroquois to
the lake that came to bear his name: Lake Champlain.


97


_Lake Champlain in the fall_



99


Many different Native groups lived in these lands.
The French made **treaties** with some of them, including
the **Algonquin** [al-GON-kwin] people and the Huron

[HYER-on] people. The French agreed to **trade** with
these people and not fight with them.


Native people would bring beaver **pelts** to **trade** . In
some cases, they would bring **pelts** they had gathered
themselves. In other cases, they would bring **pelts** they
had obtained by **trading** with other Native people.


The French traders would **barter** with Native people.
They would give them things they wanted **in exchange**
for the beaver **pelts** .


100


_A beaver has thick fur that was used to make hats._



101


Many of the things the Native people wanted were
made of metal. Most Native people did not make their
own metal products. They had to **trade** for these items.
Many Native people **traded** furs for knives and ax
blades. Others **traded** for kettles and fishhooks. Still
others **traded** for glass beads from Europe, which were
highly desirable.


The French merchants would gather up lots of beaver
**pelts** . Then, they would ship the **pelts** back to France
and sell them. They made a lot of money doing this, so
they did it again and again.


As time went on, the French traders learned what
the Native people liked. They learned that many Native
people would **trade**
beaver **pelts** for wool
blankets. Some would
**trade** for tobacco. Others
would **trade** for guns
and gunpowder.

_A beaver_


In 2011, the people of Canada put an image of a
beaver on the back of their nickel. They did not put
the beaver on their nickel because he is cute. They put
the beaver there because the fur **trade** is an important
part of the history of Canada. For two hundred years,
the fur **trade** was a source of income for French and
Native people alike.

## **Caribbean Words**
# **12**

Did you know that some words we use every day
come from the Caribbean, an area of islands between
North and South America? These are words that
were used by Native people before Columbus and
the **conquistadors** came. Later, they were picked up
by Europeans who came to the Americas, including
English speakers.


For each of the following words, there are clues that
will help you try to guess it.


106


_The area inside the gray line on the map is part of the Caribbean._


107


Clues for Word #1


- This word describes a big storm.


- The winds in this storm swirl around in a
big circle. This kind of storm is sort of like a
tornado but it’s much bigger. However, unlike a
tornado, this kind of storm usually travels over
water. It gets weaker when it travels over land.


- People who live on the Gulf Coast of Texas have
to worry about this kind of storm. The winds
it brings can damage houses near the beach and
can even knock houses to the ground.


- The name of this storm sort of rhymes with
window pane.


What is the word? (Turn the **page** to see the answer.)

Answer to last riddle: _hurricane_


The word, hurricane, comes from the Carib
