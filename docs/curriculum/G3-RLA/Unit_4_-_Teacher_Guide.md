**Grade 3 | Unit 4**
Introduction


~~**ANCIENT ROME**~~


This introduction includes the necessary background information to teach the _Ancient Rome_ unit.
This unit contains 13 daily lessons, plus two Pausing Point days that may be used for differentiated
instruction. Each lesson will require a total of 120 minutes. Lesson 13 contains the Unit Assessment.


As noted, two days are intended to be used as Pausing Point days. These Pausing Points are
embedded into the instruction at appropriate points, with the first one after Lesson 5, and the
second after Lesson 9. You may choose to continue to the next lesson and schedule the first Pausing
Point day for another day in the unit sequence. Pausing Points can be used to focus on content
understanding, writing, spelling, grammar, morphology skills, or fluency.


~~**FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS**~~


**Reading**


The Reader for Unit 4, _Stories of Ancient Rome_, consists largely of nonfiction selections describing
the historical events and culture of the ancient Roman civilization and one fictional retelling of
an ancient Roman myth. Students will read about the founding of Rome as well as about several
mythical Roman gods and goddesses. They will study the historical rise and fall of the Roman
Republic and Empire, as well as key historical figures such as Hannibal, Julius Caesar, and Augustus.
They will also study the origin and spread of Christianity in ancient Rome.


**Spelling**


During this unit’s spelling exercises, students will review the spelling patterns of _r_ -controlled vowels
as well as spellings of the sound /ee/. In Lessons 1–3, students will review _r_ -controlled vowels
spelled ‘ar’, ‘or’, ‘er’, ‘ir’, and ‘ur’. The spelling ‘or’ will be pronounced /or/ and /er/. In Lessons 5 and 8,
students will review the sound of /ee/ spelled ‘ee’ and ‘e’. In Lessons 9–13, students will review the
sound of /ee/ spelled ‘ea’, ‘ie’, and ‘i’.


**Grammar**


Grammar continues with a review and expansion of skills introduced in second grade. Students will
review verb tenses and the verbs _to be_ and _to have_ as well as subject–verb agreement, learning to
change the spelling of verbs to match various subjects. Students will have large blocks of grammar
instruction each week and instructional time for review.


Introduction Ancient Rome
**1**


**2**



**Morphology**


Throughout Grade 3, students will study word parts, such as prefixes, suffixes, and root words,
during the morphology portion of the lessons. In this unit, students will study the common suffixes
_–er_, – _or_, _–ist_, – _ian_, _–y_, and – _al_ . They will review how suffixes change the meaning of root words and
how they may change the part of speech of that word. Students will also define and use words with
these suffixes in different contexts.


~~**WHY ANCIENT ROME IS IMPORTANT**~~


This unit will introduce your students to an ancient civilization whose contributions can be seen in
many areas of our lives today. Students will be introduced to the culture of ancient Rome, including
religion, food, education, social class structure, and entertainment. They will learn about Roman
geography and history, government, major leaders, monumental battles, and the rise and decline of
the Roman Empire. Students will also learn about ancient Rome’s influence on and contributions to
our society today.


While this content is not a replacement for grade-level social studies instruction, the text that
students will be reading and discussing in this unit provides opportunities for students to build
content knowledge and draw connections to the strands of Geography, History, and Social Studies
Skills from the Social Studies TEKS. The content students learn in this grade will serve as the basis
for more in-depth study in the later grades of the Roman Republic, the Punic Wars, Julius Caesar,
Augustus Caesar, and the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. The content will also help students
establish a basis for more in-depth study in the later grades of comparative religions and the
impact religion can have on culture and government. For more information about the quantitative
and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text
Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


Ancient Rome can be largely thought of as two completely different cultures, one of polytheism,
with multiple Roman gods adapted from ancient Greece, and another of monotheistic Christianity.
The unit helps students understand the origins and scope of this cultural change, with studies at the
beginning of the unit focused on Roman polytheism and at the end on Roman Christianity. Students
will learn about the pantheon of Roman gods and the significant impact of polytheistic Roman
religious beliefs on early Roman culture. Later in the unit, students will learn about the early history
of Christianity, with selections from the New Testament books of the Christian Bible providing
context on beliefs about Jesus of Nazareth. Students will learn of Constantine the Great’s religious
conversion and the cascade of changes this had on the empire. These readings are included to help
students to build vocabulary and background knowledge relevant for ongoing studies of history
and literature, as the religious transformation that occurred in Rome continues to have significant
impact today. For more information on using religious source material in reading/language arts,
consult the program guide.


Unit 4


**Prior Knowledge**


Students who have received instruction in the program in Grades 1 and 2 will already have
pertinent background knowledge for this unit. For students who have not received prior instruction,
introductory knowledge is addressed at the beginning of each unit.

~~**WRITING**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


Students have many opportunities to write in a variety of ways and for different purposes. The
formal writing piece for the _Ancient Rome_ unit is a multiday performance task focusing on writing
an opinion piece with supporting reasons. Students will write an extended response to a prompt
that asks them to write an opinion piece about whether architecture or Latin were Rome’s greatest
lasting contribution, and will support the opinion with reasons.


Everyday writing opportunities come in many forms, including notetaking, short opinion reflections,
and extended responses requiring evidence from the text. Students will also use graphic organizers
to gather and categorize information from reading or from the Read-Alouds, or to plan for writing.


A writing portfolio will also be introduced in this unit. Activity pages with the Writing Portfolio icon
should be placed in the portfolio for future student reference in the unit. Prior to the start of the
unit, you may wish to have students create their own writing portfolio, using a manila folder or
construction paper. Many writing lessons provide opportunities for students to collaborate, share
ideas, and give feedback on their writing.


In Grade 3, students will write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive, leaving
appropriate spaces between words. In order to master these skills, encourage students to complete
activities in cursive throughout the unit.


~~**PERFORMANCE TASKS AND ASSESSMENTS**~~


The Primary Focus objectives in each lesson are carefully structured and sequenced throughout the
unit to help build student understanding. Additionally, formative assessments are provided to help
keep track of their progress toward objectives and standards. These can be found in the Student
Activity Book and are referenced in every lesson.


The _Ancient Rome_ unit will end with a Unit Assessment covering the content of the unit and reading
objectives taught throughout the unit, as well as a grammar and morphology assessment.


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.


Unit 4


~~**INSTRUCTIONAL COMPONENTS**~~

- Show students Image Card C.U4.L1.1 (Mediterranean region). Tell students
that, long ago, a large group of people lived together in this area in a wellorganized way as a civilization. Tell students the ancient Roman civilization
developed in an area of the world across the Atlantic Ocean on the continent
of Europe. Explain to students that they will be hearing some terms and
references to the time when the ancient Roman civilization began.


  - _BC_ stands for _before Christ_, and _BCE_ stands for _before the Common Era_
or _before the Christian Era_ . Explain that _BC_ and _BCE_ are two terms used
to reference events that came before the birth of Jesus of Nazareth, also
referred to as Jesus Christ.


  - Explain that today we live in the period known as _AD_ or _CE_ . _AD_ stands
for _Anno Domini_ and, in English, it means “in the Year of the Lord.” Tell
students this describes the time after Jesus was born. _CE_ stands for
_Common Era_ or _Christian Era_ .


  - Tell students that some people today use the terms _BCE_ (before the
Common Era) and _CE_ (of the Common Era). But, BC and AD are also still
widely used. They will hear both sets of terms.

 - Point to Image Card C.U4.L1.2: Modern Rome with Aerial View of Colosseum


What is Rome? Rome is the capital city of Italy, which is a country in

Europe. This aerial scene shows what you might see if you visit Rome

today. It is a beautiful, vibrant city, full of fascinating things to see

and do.


 - Teacher Pause and Model: As good readers and listeners, we are always asking
ourselves what the key idea is or what the paragraph is about. When I read the
first paragraph, I noticed lots of details that explain that Rome is beautiful and
vibrant. I also read that there are a lot of things to see. This whole paragraph is
about Rome.


 - Say: “Let’s read the next paragraph to see if we can figure out the key idea and
supporting details.”


Here is something that thousands of people travel to Rome to see

every year. Does anyone know what this is? It’s called the Colosseum.

When you look at this picture, you might ask yourself another

question: What was the city of Rome like a long time ago? After all,

this building does not appear to be new or in a very good condition.

That is because it is almost two thousand years old!


What is the key idea of this paragraph?


» The Colosseum is in Rome.


What are some supporting details?


» Thousands of people travel to Rome to see the Colosseum, and it is two thousand

years old.

or baseball, ancient Roman sports fans came to the Colosseum to

watch combat sports, often involving people fighting each other or

animals—sometimes to their death. The fact that their sports were so

bloody and deadly might lead you to think that Romans were violent

people, and they were in many ways. The Romans had some of the

most powerful armies in history.


But as you can see from the beauty of Roman architecture in this

photograph, the ancient Romans were also incredibly creative

people. The Romans were the first to widely use arches in many of

their buildings and bridges. The arch, first used by the Egyptians

and Mesopotamians and improved upon by the Romans, allows an

opening of a structure—such as a window or doorway—to be much

wider because the curved wedges of stone offer more support than

a flat piece of stone would. You will learn more about this and other

contributions of the ancient Romans as you hear about their history,

government, art, religion, and more.


- Point to Image Card C.U4.L1.4: Map of Roman Empire


Beginning with the city of Rome, the Romans built a civilization that

controlled most of present-day western Europe, as well as large parts

of present-day Asia and Africa. In yellow, this map shows the large

area the Romans controlled at the height of their empire. See the

boot-shaped country near the middle? That is the country we now

call Italy. Italy is called a peninsula because it is surrounded on three

sides by water. This is where the ancient Roman civilization began,

and from there it spread to the north, to the south, to the east, and to

the west! It took many years to build this vast empire. That is why the

saying “Rome wasn’t built in a day” has come to refer to the creating

of something that is large or complicated and that takes much time

and dedication.


As their empire spread, the Romans also spread their culture, or way

of life, including their laws, art, architectural influences, language, and

knowledge. Although most ancient Roman buildings are now ruins or

are completely gone, Roman culture has changed the world in ways

we continue to experience today.

- Point to Image Card C.U4.L1.5: Etruscan Ruins


The Romans were not the first people to think the area known as

present-day Italy was a good place to live. In fact, the ancient Greeks

had settled in parts of southern Italy. Starting around 700 BC, a

civilization called the Etruscans moved into central Italy. Nobody is

sure where the Etruscans came from exactly, but we know that they

started building towns a couple hundred years before the city of

Rome existed.


This picture shows the ruins of a walled Etruscan city. Why do you

think they built the city in that particular spot? It looks like it would

be hard to get there, doesn’t it? That was the point! Despite its

beauty and all that the land and nearby sea had to offer, Italy—and

basically everywhere else in the Mediterranean region at the time—

could be a dangerous place. The Etruscans weren’t the only people

living in this region. There was always a chance that another group

of people would come along and decide they wanted to call the area

of present-day Italy their home, or steal all the resources they could

from the people who already lived there. In those times, it was smart

to build a city on a steep hill surrounded by high walls for protection

from invaders.


- Point to Image Card C.U4.L1.6: Etruscan Marble


The Etruscans and Greeks were only two of several groups to settle

on the peninsula of Italy. Many of these cultures would essentially

be mixed together to create Roman culture. Like other people during

that time period, the Etruscans were fond of stone sculptures. In

some areas, the hills and mountains have large sections of hard,

sculptures from this marble more than two thousand years ago.

Etruscan art and architecture—such as paintings, sculpture, and

building designs—helped shape Roman art and architecture.


- Point to Image Card C.U4.L1.7: Roman Artifacts


These are items in a museum today, like countless other Roman

artifacts in museum collections all over the world. An artifact is an

object that was created by a person who lived long, long ago. An artifact

is like a “door to the past.” Tools, weapons, jewelry, artwork, pottery, and

household items such as dishes or pots are all examples of artifacts

that provide clues about people and allow us to “see” into the past.


Artifacts, along with ruins like the Colosseum, roads, and bridges,

teach us the way ancient Romans lived, worked, played, and fought.

Some of these remains are easy to see, like the ruins that dot the

Italian landscape. Others have been buried for many years and

continue to be discovered during archaeological digs. Archaeologists

are puzzle-solvers. They find little clues hidden in the ground—broken

shards of pottery, an arrowhead, a few beads—and, bit by bit, they

piece together a story about the people who created these things.

One thing that allowed Rome to spread so far and wide was its

roads for their armies and to make traveling and trading easier.

These roads were able to last many years because they were made

with concrete—a hard, strong material made by mixing water with

cement, sand, and pebbles and allowing the mixture to harden. The

Romans were the first to invent this particular concrete mixture,

which is still used in modern times. Rome became known for its

many well-built roads, which created a network along which some

of Europe’s finest cities and richest lands developed. Some of these

concrete roads still exist today, as does the saying born of this time:

“All roads lead to Rome.”

~~**WORD WORK: RUINS (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _ruins_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity for
students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed. You may
wish to review syllable division patterns at this time.


2. In the Read-Aloud, you heard, “Although most ancient Roman buildings are
now ruins or are completely gone, Roman culture has changed the world in
ways we continue to experience today.”


3. _Ruins_ are the remains of a structure or of an old civilization, such as a brokendown building, bridge, or road. Many people visit the Machu Picchu ruins in
Peru, South America, which are remnants from the ancient Inca civilization.


4. Have you ever seen, learned about, or heard about ruins? What and where
were they? Be sure to use the word _ruins_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or
three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase students’ responses to
make complete sentences: “The ruins were ” or “Ruins are .”]

from generation to generation.


 - Raise your hand if you have heard any of the following proverbs:

    - Don’t cry over spilled milk.


    - Never judge a book by its cover.


    - When the cat’s away, the mice will play.


    - We are all in the same boat.


  - Proverbs usually express some truth and observations of everyday life.

Some proverbs have a literal meaning, like “we are all in the same boat.” This
may be true if a group of people are sailing around an ocean and something
happens. You are literally in the same boat, and you are in the same situation
as everyone else. However, typically this proverb is used figuratively to
describe when a group of people are in the same situation together.


  - Tell students that, in the next few weeks, they will continue to learn

about Rome and how it came to be one of the largest and most powerful
civilizations. Explain that this took hundreds of years to develop, not just one
day. Tell students that the phrase “Rome wasn’t built in a day” could be used
to describe the time and patience it takes to finish a project. If someone asks
you how your work is going, you could reply, “Rome wasn’t built in a day.”


  - Show students Image Card C.U4.L1.2: Modern Rome with an Aerial View

of Colosseum, and remind them that Romans built an amazing network
of interconnected roads across most of Europe that lead into and out of
Rome. This network of roads made communication and travel much easier
throughout the Roman Empire and allowed the empire to continue to expand.
Tell students that the phrase “All roads lead to Rome” is a proverb used to
describe Rome’s roads. This proverb can be used today to describe students
working on a math problem. All the students might have the same answer,
but they solved the problem differently.

“But this is Rome too,” she added, as she traced a
circle that was so large it seemed to touch all four sides
of the map.


The students looked confused.


“How can it be both?” Charlie Chatter shouted out.


“I’ll explain,” Mrs. Teachwell said, “but please raise
your hand if you would like to speak.”


Charlie Chatter nodded. It was not the first time he
had heard this. In fact, Mrs. Teachwell had asked him to
raise his hand many times, but it was hard for Charlie.
His mouth seemed to be faster than his hand.


“Rome started out as a little town along the Tiber
River,” Mrs. Teachwell explained.

question: “Why are Mrs. Teachwell’s students confused when she talks to
them about the location of Rome on the map?”


 - When students have finished reading, restate the question and ask students
to answer.


» Mrs. Teachwell said that the small dot on the map represented the location of a

place called Rome, but then she also outlined a much larger area and indicated

that all of this land was also known as Rome.


 - You may need to reread the first two sentences on **page 2** aloud, as you
gesture in a manner similar to Mrs. Teachwell, pointing to the map.


What is the name of the river along which the town of Rome first started?


» Tiber

“Yes,” said Mrs. Teachwell, “but let’s see that hand!”


The students giggled.


“As Charlie has just reminded us,” Mrs. Teachwell
said, “many **civilizations** spring up along the banks of
a river. Rome was no exception. It sprang up here, on
the banks of the Tiber River, among seven hills. At first,
Rome was just a few houses on a hill. Then, it grew and
grew and grew. After a while, people started building
houses on other hills nearby. Then, the little towns on
the hills grew together to make a big city. In fact, to this
day, Rome is known as the ‘City of Seven Hills.’


“Then, the Romans fought wars with their
neighbors. The Romans won most of these wars. They
**defeated** the Etruscans, who lived north of them. They
**conquered** the Greeks, who had settled to the south, as
well. It wasn’t long before they controlled most of this
piece of land that we call Italy.”

  - In an _r_ -controlled syllable, the vowel is neither long nor short; it is controlled
by the letter R and the /r/ sound. The vowel before the _r_ does not make its
regular long or short sound, so we say it is being controlled by the _r_ . Some
_r_ -controlled vowels can make the same sound. For example, the sound of /r/
can also be represented as “er, ir, ur”. There isn’t a concrete rule for how to
know which spelling to use, and this is where teaching students what is most
common and least common is important.


**TEKS 3.2.B.i** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by spelling multisyllabic words with closed syllables, open syllables,
VC _e_ syllables, vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs, _r_ -controlled syllables, and final stable syllables.


Unit 4


 - It may be helpful to tell students the following: The most common spelling
for /r/ is _er_ ; the second most common spelling for /r/ is _ir_ ; the least common
spelling for /r/ is _ur_ . Remind students that some _r-_ controlled vowels may
have a schwa sound; words with “or” like in _doctor_ can have the /er/ sound;
words with “ar” can have a long sound like _marry_ or schwa like _dollar_ .


 - Tell students that they need to be able to recognize the _r-_ controlled syllable
when they read. Direct students to take note of the different variations as
they circle the _r-_ controlled vowel sound.

Let’s learn about the mythical gods and goddesses of
Rome.

In the early part of Rome, the empire promoted a belief
in many gods.

In many ways, these mythical Roman gods acted like
human beings. They ate and drank. They played tricks on
each other. They fell in love and got into fights. But there
was one main way in which the gods were not like
human beings: the gods were **immortal** . Human beings
might live for many years. Some might even live to be
one hundred. Eventually, though, they would die. The
Romans believed that the mythical gods, on the other
hand, lived forever. They did not—and could not—die.

The Romans’ ideas about their mythical gods were
similar to the ancient Greeks. In fact, they believed in
many of the same gods as the Greeks, but they called
them by different names. The chart shows the Roman
names for some mythical Greek gods you may already
know.

**Show Image U4.L2.1**
Farming scenes and mosaics


To understand Roman beliefs and

religion, let us first think about some

of the early inhabitants of what we

now call Italy, the people who lived

there and whose children and grandchildren would later be called

citizens of Rome. Back then, before Rome was a powerful city,

most people in the area—such as the Etruscans and the Greeks—

were farmers.


In ancient times, people had very little scientific understanding

about weather and climate patterns. They did not have a scientific

explanation for why the seasons change, or even why day turns to

night. All people knew was that they had to survive in a challenging

and dangerous world in which anything could happen: floods,

droughts, diseases, and plagues of insects—just to name a few.

Sometimes, things were just fine, and farmers could enjoy great,

**bountiful** harvests. Other times, it rained just enough for farmers to

harvest the amount of food they needed.


Working the fields all day, an ancient farmer must have had time to

think and ask questions about why things were the way they were.

“Why does it rain some years and not others? Why are my sheep

healthy, while my neighbor’s flock of sheep became sick and died?

Why did a flood come and wash away all my crops last year?”


**TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text.



Support


On the board, create a
T-chart. Label one category
“Life” and the other
“Beliefs.” As the text is read
aloud, add key ideas to
each part of the T-chart.


Challenge


Have students research
the different crops ancient
Romans may have grown.


Support


Remind students of the
previous paragraph in the
Read-Aloud that states,
“people had very little
scientific understanding
about weather and climate
patterns.” So they believed
the mythical gods and
goddesses controlled the
weather and climate.

**Show Image U4.L2.2**
Saturn holding a scythe


An ancient Roman farmer would

have believed in a mythical god

named Saturn, who was—according

to myth—the god of the harvest who

existed before all the other gods. Whether the harvest was good or

bad, the Roman farmer believed that Saturn had something to do

with it. If the harvest was bad, then that meant Saturn was mad. If

the harvest was bountiful, then that meant Saturn was happy. This

painting shows a statue of Saturn holding a scythe

[/sighth/] in one hand, a tool used by farmers to cut wheat.


Ancient Romans tried to keep Saturn and the other mythical gods

they believed in happy. Romans participated in the yearly Saturnalia

Festival in late December to honor Saturn. This was a time of

**boisterous** celebration with singing, dancing, and feasting all day

and night.


- Have students add information on Saturn to Activity Page 2.1.


Check for Understanding


On the back of Activity Page 2.1, have students list one detail they learned
about Roman life and one detail they learned about Roman beliefs. (Walk
around the classroom to monitor student answers.) If students have
trouble identifying one detail about Roman life and one detail about
Roman beliefs, then review Roman life and beliefs learned thus far.


Unit 4


**Show Image U4.L2.3**
Roman temple


Somewhere nearby, there might have

been an **elaborate** temple for Saturn.

A temple is a type of religious building

in which people worship. This picture

shows a well-preserved temple that was built by the Romans in what

is now the country of France. This temple gives you a good idea of

what a temple built to **worship** a mythical Roman god looked like.

Inside the temple, there would have been a statue of the Roman

god and an altar, or special table, where gifts could be left for them.

Priests were often dedicated to a particular god. Priests dedicated to

Saturn lived in his temple and performed **rituals** to please him. They

made offerings to Saturn, like delivering food to the temple, to thank

him for helping with the harvest.

Agriculture was not the only thing

for which the Romans had a mythical

god. In fact, some ancient Romans

believed that the world was ruled by

many gods, each of which played a special role in keeping order in

the world. Romans were not alone in believing that there were many

gods. Such beliefs were common throughout the world at the time.

As you heard earlier, the Romans had similar ideas about gods and

goddesses as the Greeks and other neighbors in the Mediterranean

region.


East of the area that is now the country of Italy, there is another area

that juts out into the Mediterranean Sea. This is now known as the

country of Greece. If you compare Greek and Roman culture, you will

find many similarities. In ancient days, it was easier to travel by boat

than by land between the areas where Italy and Greece are today.


Lesson 2 “Roman Mythology”

Both of these countries are separated by a fairly narrow body of

water that is dotted with dozens of large and small islands. Ancient

peoples of Greece and Rome often came into contact with each other

on those islands, or on one another’s coastlines, as people searched

for new places to settle. This close contact brought lots of trade

between people, including the blending and exchanging of ideas

and beliefs.

Roman gods


Many Romans had heard of Zeus,

the king of the Greek gods, who was

believed to rule over a collection of

gods, including Aphrodite (the mythical goddess of love), Apollo (the

mythical god of the sun, music, healing, and knowledge), Ares (the

mythical god of war), and Athena (the mythical goddess of wisdom

and understanding). Greeks went to Athena’s temple and **worshiped**

her when they needed help with tough problems. She was also

considered to be the goddess of war, which is why she has a spear

and helmet.


The Romans also believed in many of the same types of gods and

goddesses that the Greeks believed in, although the Romans had

different names for most of them because they had a different

language. Some historians would say that the Romans “borrowed”

these gods and goddesses from the Greeks, although the idea of

many of these deities may have already existed before the Greeks

and Romans would have encountered each other.


The mythical Greek goddess of wisdom, Athena, was similar to the

Roman goddess Minerva. The Greek king of the gods was named

Zeus; the Romans called their king of the gods Jupiter. Instead of the

Greek name Ares, the mythical Roman god of war was called Mars.

Instead of the Greek name Aphrodite, the mythical Roman goddess of

love was called Venus.

Mount Olympus


Like the Greeks, the Romans believed

that some of the gods and goddesses

lived in a palace on the very top of

Mount Olympus in Greece. These

beings were known as the Olympian gods.


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (20 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What is a myth?


» a story told by ancient cultures to explain how and why something came to be or

happen in nature


2. **Literal.** Are myths fact or fiction?


» fiction


3. **Evaluative.** How is a myth different from a legend?


» Myths are completely fictional, whereas legends are partly based on factual

people or events in history, even though they are usually exaggerated.


4. **Inferential.** What did some inhabitants of Rome—and inhabitants of other

places that had polytheistic beliefs—do to please the mythical gods they

believed in?


» They would worship the mythical gods, celebrate with boisterous festivals, and

perform rituals, such as delivering food to the mythical gods’ elaborate temples.


5. **Inferential.** Why were there many farmers in ancient Rome?


» Agriculture and farming were very important to the ancient Romans’ way of life.


6. **Inferential.** Why did the ancient Roman farmers want to please Saturn, the

mythical god of the harvest?


» They believed that a bad harvest would result if he were mad, and they tried to

keep Saturn happy so they could have a bountiful harvest.

» Similarities: They were both polytheistic and believed in many of the same types

of mythical gods and goddesses, as well as in many of the same mythological

heroes and stories; because the ancient Greeks and Romans lived near each

other and came in contact with each other often, they exchanged many ideas and

shared similar cultures; they had similar foods, including olives; etc.


» Differences: They each had their own languages and had different names for most

of their mythical gods and goddesses; the Greek civilization existed before the

Roman; they each developed different cities and eventually countries; etc.

1. Write the word _elaborate_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity
for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed. You
may also review syllable division patterns at this time.


2. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “Somewhere nearby, there might have been
an elaborate temple for Saturn.” _Elaborate_ means highly detailed or made of
many carefully placed or arranged pieces and parts. For example, some Asian
civilizations have very elaborate forms of writing in which each mark has an
important meaning.


3. Have you ever seen or made something that was elaborate? What was it?
Be sure to use the word _elaborate_ when you tell about it. [Ask two or three
students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses to
make complete sentences: “ is/was elaborate.”]


4. What part of speech is the word _elaborate_ ?


  - **Use a Synonyms and Antonyms activity for follow-up.** Ask students,
“What does _elaborate_ mean? What are some synonyms, or words that have a

  - On the board, point to each vocabulary word. As the teacher points to the
vocabulary word, the students hold up their response card. The teacher may
call on student volunteers to provide the definition and use the word in a
sentence based on response card answer.


    - Lesson Vocabulary: _immortal, messenger, mission, rough, wisdom,_
_boisterous, bountiful, elaborate, inhabitant, ritual_, and _worship_

**Characters in Mythology**



Let’s learn about the mythical gods and goddesses of
Rome.

In the early part of Rome, the empire promoted a belief
in many gods.

In many ways, these mythical Roman gods acted like
human beings. They ate and drank. They played tricks on
each other. They fell in love and got into fights. But there
was one main way in which the gods were not like
human beings: the gods were **immortal** . Human beings
might live for many years. Some might even live to be
one hundred. Eventually, though, they would die. The
Romans believed that the mythical gods, on the other
hand, lived forever. They did not—and could not—die.

|Zeus<br>Jupiter|Ares<br>Mars|
|Hera<br>Juno|Hermes<br>Mercury|
|Poseidon<br>Neptune|Dionysus<br>Bacchus|
|Aphrodite<br>Venus|Athena<br>Minerva|
|Eros<br>Cupid|Apollo<br>Apollo|



**64**



The Romans’ ideas about their mythical gods were
similar to the ancient Greeks. In fact, they believed in

them by different names. The chart shows the Roman
names for some mythical Greek gods you may already
know. 11

Tyrant Etruscan king


Before the establishment of the

Roman Republic, areas in present
day Italy and surrounding lands

were divided up into lots of little

kingdoms with many different rulers. Some kings were richer and

more powerful than others. The kings and their people fought each

other all the time, and over the years they developed long-standing

**rivalries** that often resulted in warfare. The city of Rome was

controlled by a long line of Etruscan kings who had ruled for several

generations. Etruscan kings worried, above all else, about losing

power—especially losing control of their city. They figured the best

way to hang on to power was to be as harsh as possible with their

subjects, the people over whom they ruled.

Roman politicians appealing to the
people of Rome


Around 500 BC, the people living in

Rome decided they had had enough!

They overthrew their Etruscan

king and created a new form of government. Rome’s new form of

government was now called a republic. In some very important ways,

this new government was based on a form of government that the

ancient Greeks practiced at the time: democracy. Instead of having a

king make all the laws and tell everyone else what to do, the Romans

decided that the citizens—the _people_ —should be able to elect those

who would work together to make decisions and form laws to guide

how their society was ruled. In this new form of government, the

people had more of a voice in how their society would be ruled as

a republic.

- Say, “As I read aloud, draw a picture to summarize the Roman government in

**Show Image U4.L3.3**
Senate advising the consuls


Here’s how the new form of

government worked: Instead of a king,

there was a group of people called the

Senate. Members of the Senate were

called senators. There were 300 senators in the Roman Senate, all of

whom were men. Senators held their position for as long as they lived.

The people elected two **consuls**, two people whose job it was to make

final decisions on whether a new law should be passed, or whether,

for instance, to go to war. They had the power to command the army

and were advised by the Senate. The **consuls** were powerful people

in the Roman Republic, but they did not have the power to write new

laws on their own.


Senators debated over what kinds of laws were needed in Rome.

When senators came to an agreement, they would advise the **consuls**

on their decisions. If one consul made a decision that the other

**consul** did not approve of, he could say, “Veto,” which is Latin for “I

forbid.” Even though the consuls had the **attributes** of being very

important and powerful, the two **consuls** had to work together to

create a process of checks and balances, or a way to balance out each

other’s decision. These ideas of the veto and checks and balances

are two practices from ancient Rome that are part of the American

government and other governments around the world today.


- Act out the changes in the Roman government: Choose one student to
represent the king, five students to represent the citizens, five students to

**Show Image U4.L3.4**
Patricians


Not all citizens of Rome were treated

equally. In fact, some people living in

Rome were not citizens at all. People

of Rome were divided into groups,

each with different rights and privileges under the law. The smallest

and most powerful group was called the _patricians_ . Patricians were

Rome’s **elite**, a small group of wealthy, powerful people who owned

large homes in the city, vineyards in the country, and villas on the

coast. The patricians were citizens of Rome, meaning they had the

right to vote, and they had certain protections and privileges under

the law. Because they were the most educated and privileged group,


Unit 4


the patricians were also the ones most likely to become senators,

so they got to make a lot of the laws in the Roman Republic. As

you might guess, the people in this painting are wealthy Roman

patricians. In contrast to the ancient Greek culture, women in ancient

Rome were considered citizens, and wealthy women were part of

the **elite** patrician group, although they could not vote or serve as a

senator or **consul** .

 - Say, “As I read, write down key words that describes plebeians in
the Image 5 box.”


**Show Image U4.L3.5**
Plebeians


Another group of Roman citizens

were called _plebeians_ . Plebeians

were second-class citizens, meaning

that they did not have all the rights

and privileges enjoyed by patricians.

However, the plebeians had one big advantage: numbers. Because

the plebeians made up the largest portion of Roman citizenry—by

far—the wealthy patricians learned that they needed to make

sure the plebeians were happy, or at least happy enough that they

wouldn’t rise up and try to take more power for themselves.


Like patricians, plebeians were citizens, so they could vote. However,

they were subject to a different set of laws than patricians. For

instance, a patrician could freely insult a plebeian, but a plebeian

would be in big trouble if he did the same to a patrician. Plebeians

could own property, but it was hard for them to gain enough land or

money to become as rich or as powerful as the patricians.


Plebeians came in all shapes and sizes, including fairly wealthy

shopkeepers and traders, hardworking farmers and fishermen, and

other poor and **lowly** workers. Farmers were important because


Lesson 3 “Roman Mythology” and “The Roman Republic”
**77**


plentiful crops were very necessary for the success of Rome’s

culture and civilization. That is one of the main reasons why Romans

worshiped Saturn, the mythical god of the harvest.

- Say, “As I read, list one fact that you learned from the Read-Aloud in the

**Show Image U4.L3.6**
Romans at the marketplace


When farmers are successful and

have a great harvest, they have more

food than they really need to just feed

their family. This is called a **surplus** .

Roman farmers with a **surplus** of food could share their bountiful

supply or sell it to other people at the marketplace. Those people,

in turn, didn’t have to work as hard to feed themselves. Instead,

they could turn their attention to other things, like making pottery,

blacksmithing, or weaving cloth. Some Romans worked on making

elaborate sculptures and mosaics. When they had a **surplus** of

harvested crops, ancient Romans also had a **surplus** of time to honor

their mythical gods, which they spent by building temples, going to

festivals like Saturnalia, and participating in rituals.

Ruins of Roman forums


Many Romans who didn’t

farm were traders and

merchants. They would

sell goods that came from ships from all over the known world.



**78**



Unit 4


Remember, Italy is a peninsula in the Mediterranean Sea. These

goods would be sold in markets located in large, open gathering

places called forums. In these forums, people could shop, listen to

debates, and worship in temples. The biggest forum was in the heart

of Rome, and was therefore called the Roman Forum, or just the

Forum. The Senate had an important building in the Forum, where the

senators and **consuls** met to debate and discuss issues. The Forum

was a very important place in Roman society, serving as a gathering

place of culture, economy, politics, religion, and much more. The

ruins of the Forum today attract many tourists each year.

 - Say, “As I read, write down key words that describe enslaved people in Rome
in the Image 8 box.”


**Show Image U4.L3.8**
Roman slaves


Another group of people who lived

in Rome were the slaves. Enslaved

people were not considered citizens of

Rome, so they could not vote. Slaves

belonged to their owners, so they did not have the freedom to do as

they pleased. Enslaved people could not choose where to live or work.

They had no choice in what job they got to do, and they were not

allowed to quit the jobs their owners gave them. Roman slaves did

have some rights. For instance, Roman slaves were allowed to receive

as much education as they needed to be better at whatever job they

had. After some time, if enslaved people worked very hard for their

owner, they could earn their freedom. Once slaves were given their

freedom, their children were considered full Roman citizens.


You may be wondering where these enslaved people came from. As

Rome expanded into new territories, the Romans fought wars with

the people already living in those areas. It was common for the

people on the losing side of a war to become slaves for the winning

side when the war was over. Enslaved people were considered the

property of their owners; they had to obey their owners and do

difficult work for no pay. They were also not allowed to insult or

attack a Roman citizen, or there would be consequences. Enslaved

people were considered the lowliest people in Roman society—at the

other end of the spectrum from the **elite** class.

What is the difference between a key idea and supporting details?


» The key idea is the most important idea of the paragraph.

Supporting details are information that supports the key idea.

If students cannot recall the difference between a key idea and

supporting details, then draw a graphic organizer identifying the

key idea and supporting details as a reminder.

Legionary


Imagine you are a soldier in the Roman

army. Your army is called the Roman

Legion, and you are a legionary. You are

wearing heavy, thick armor and



a helmet with flaps to protect your head and face during fights. If

you are one of Rome’s finest soldiers, you are wearing a helmet with

a furry strip on top. Besides your armor, you have a shield, a spear,

and a short sword. You have learned to march in perfect step with

hundreds of other legionaries. You have faced many enemies in

battle, and you are prepared to fight for Rome. Since the founding of

the Roman Republic, you and other legionaries have proudly fought

to expand Rome’s power and influence.


**Student Reader page 25**
Roman territory and Carthaginian territory


Rome is no longer just a city. Through the years it has expanded to

include the majority of the area known as present-day Italy. Dozens

of kingdoms and other areas have been absorbed by the Roman

Republic. Some have resisted and fought Rome’s growing power, only

to fall before the mighty Roman legions. Other kings have accepted

Roman rule and have become wealthy patrician citizens.


Now you are preparing to fight a new enemy. This enemy comes from

across the Mediterranean. They are called the Carthaginians, and

One of the reasons the Romans had been able to
expand so quickly through Italy and beyond was because
they were excellent fighters. Roman soldiers were highly
**disciplined**, meaning that they obeyed orders and were
more determined to win for Rome than to survive. The
main part of the Roman army consisted of heavily-armored
soldiers. They were the foot soldiers, or infantry. The
infantry was supported by cavalry, soldiers on horseback
like the ones in this image. They marched shoulder-toshoulder toward the enemy and won because they stayed
together instead of panicking and running away.

During these three Punic Wars,

which lasted more than one

hundred years, Rome and Carthage



fought for ultimate control of the Mediterranean Sea and all the

land surrounding it. The Punic Wars did not turn out well for the

Carthaginians. Eventually, the Romans sacked Carthage, meaning

they took everything of value and destroyed the rest. They also

took many Carthaginians as slaves. As a result of winning the Punic

Wars, Rome gained control of nearly every bit of land around the

Mediterranean. This was the beginning of one of the most powerful

empires in all of history.

**102**



Hannibal’s father fought against Rome in the First
Punic War, 264–241 BC. He made his son swear he
would carry on the fight against Rome. Hannibal swore
he would and kept his promise. It was Hannibal who
led the fight against Rome in the Second Punic War,
218–201 BC.


Hannibal gathered an army in Spain. He had tens
of thousands of foot soldiers. He had thousands more
who fought on horseback. Best of all, he had his special
forces: a squad of elephants. Hannibal had learned that
few men are brave enough to stand and fight when they
see a thundering herd of elephants coming their way.


Hannibal wanted to attack Rome. However, to
**invade** Italy, he would have to march his army over
a range of mountains called the Alps. The Alps were
tall. The **peaks** were covered with snow and ice. There
were no big roads that led across. There were only a few
slippery paths.

Most men would not have tried to cross the
mountains, but Hannibal was not like most men. He
marched his army over the mountains. His men suffered
terribly. They experienced rock slides, avalanches, and
freezing temperatures. Many of the elephants did not
make it across. In the end, though, Hannibal got his army
across the mountains and into Italy.


In Italy, Hannibal went on the attack. He beat the
Romans at Trebbia [TREB-bee-ə] in 218 BC. Then,
he wiped out an entire Roman army at the Battle of
Trasimene [TRAZ-i-meen] in 217 BC. The Romans lost
15,000 men. The Battle of Cannae [CAN-ie] was even
worse. The Romans lost at least 50,000 men, including
80 of their 300 senators.

**Unit 4, Lesson 4**

  - Students are likely to make the following errors:


    - For ‘or’, students may write ‘er’, ‘ir’, or ‘ur’


    - For ‘ir’, students may write ‘er’, ‘or’, or ‘ur’


    - For ‘ur’, students may write ‘er’, ‘ir’, or ‘or’


    - For ‘er’, students may write ‘ir’, ‘or’, or ‘ur’


While any of the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should be
aware that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find it
helpful to record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the
analysis chart. For example: Is the student consistently making errors on
specific vowels? Which ones?


  - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


  - Is the student consistently making errors on particular beginning
consonants?


  - Did the student write words for each feature correctly?


  - Also, examine the dictated sentences for errors in capitalization and
punctuation.


  - For additional practice, see worksheets in Section III-B of the _Assessment_
_and Remediation Guide_, which can be found in the program’s online
materials.

The following chart is provided for your review:


 - Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


  - The letter _e_ is most often used to spell the /ee/ sound when it occurs
either at the end of a word as in _me_, or at the end of a syllable. With the
exception of _Colosseum_, all other spelling words with _e_ we will cover in this
lesson occur at the end of the first syllable.


  - The combination _ee_ is often used to spell the /ee/ sound in the middle of
a word. However, sometimes it is used to spell /ee/ at the end of a word,
such as in _degree_, _tree_, or _bee_ .


**Note** : In this unit, students will focus on seven academic vocabulary words,

two of which are model and judge. By academic vocabulary, we mean words

that support reading comprehension and may appear across a variety of

materials in language arts and in content areas. These words can be found

in textbooks, assignment directions, and assessments. Understanding

academic vocabulary may contribute to improved performance on

assignments and assessments, as these words often appear in directions

to students. These words may appear on end-of-year assessments for

students in Grade 3. Where applicable, we use the words throughout the

unit, not just as they might refer to reading selections but also with regard to

spelling, grammar, morphology, and comprehension. They may also appear

in directions, assessments, spelling lists, and discussion questions, among

other places.


  - To _model_ means to copy.


  - To _judge_ means to form an opinion about something.


  - We encourage you to define these words for students and to use both of

these words throughout the school day so that students may experience
multiple uses of them.


Unit 4


**Universal Access**

 - In this lesson, students will listen to a Read-Aloud about daily Roman
life. Prepare students to engage with the content by doing/setting up the
following:


   - Recall who plebeians and patricians were in Roman society.


   - Show pictures of aqueducts.


   - Have students briefly write or share about their daily life. Ask “Where do
you live?”, “What do you do during the day?”, “Who are you with?”, “What
do you see?”


   - Later, extend the discussion by having them compare and contrast their

daily life with the daily life of a child living in ancient Rome.


 - In this lesson, students will also read the legend “The Sword of Damocles.”


   - Meet the characters, and practice pronouncing _Damocles_ and _Dionysius_ .


   - Define _legend_ : A story about a person or an event from the past that is
believed by many people to be true, but that cannot be proven to be
absolutely true.

the **Mediterranean** world. The Romans realized that they no longer

needed to worry about growing and producing all their own food.

Instead, they could **import** wheat, olives, and other basic foods from

other countries. Then, Roman farmers could focus on raising only the

crops they wanted.


Ancient Rome became a major center of trade. Goods from all over

the known world flowed through its ports, and in the process, Rome

became rich beyond compare. The city grew at a rapid rate. It must

have been astonishing to be there and to witness all the workers who

were involved in building the Colosseum, the Forum, the temples, and

all the other city buildings you see in this picture.


Someone built this model out of clay, and some of the buildings are

probably about as big as a pencil eraser. This model is based on what

we estimate Rome would have looked like two thousand years ago,

based on old Roman maps, drawings, and writings, as well as the

hard work of archaeologists in discovering these items. To the right

of the center of the image, you can see the Colosseum. The long, oval

structure in lower left of the image is called the Circus Maximus. This

model gives you a good idea of some of the places a Roman child

might have seen as he or she explored the city.

- **Model Asking Questions:** When reading, we need to stop and ask ourselves

questions. Sometimes questions might help clarify what we just read. Other
times questions might not be answered in what we just read. After reading
the first paragraph, do you know what _import_ means? Why didn’t the
Romans have to worry about growing their own food?


» Romans didn’t have to worry about growing their own food because they were

able to bring in the food they needed through trade with other countries.


Direct students to Activity Page 5.1. As students listen to the Read
Aloud, they should be thinking about what it would be like to be born

and raised in a plebeian family for the first part of Activity Page 5.1.


**Student Reader pages 43–44**
Roman family in their apartment


So, what would it have been like to be born and raised in the city of

Rome? Depending on who you were, you might live very different

lives. Let’s imagine that you are a child in a plebeian family. Plebeian

families were a class of common people who were not as wealthy as

the upper classes. You live with your mother, father, sister, and brother

in a small apartment near the center of the city, not far from the great

Colosseum. Your apartment building is crowded and noisy. In your

plebeian family’s apartment, there is smoke from ovens and open fires

in the courtyards where women bake and cook. They are not allowed to

cook in their apartments for fear of burning down the whole building.


On warm summer mornings, you and your friends like to go to the

bridge across the Tiber River and wave to your father and the other

merchants as they return from the docks on their way back into the

city. Your father dreams of becoming a wealthy merchant one day,

but right now he only owns one little boat. Each morning, he and his

partners row out to the docks, where the big ships unload their exotic

goods. Your father buys goods from the merchants on the ships and

then he resells the goods in other places in the city.

Compare what Roman
children might see in Rome
versus what a child in your
city might see.

they had power in their numbers� People were most
often upset when there were food shortages� This always

Although plebeian families had

opportunities to make money and

own property, life was not easy.

Because Rome relied so much on grain



shipments being imported from across the sea, sometimes there was

a food **shortage** . War and bad weather sometimes delayed those food

shipments from arriving at the wharves, and Rome would suddenly

become an angry city of thousands of hungry people. Disease was a

big problem, too. Romans worked hard to try to keep the city clean,

but it was impossible with so many people.


The patricians controlled the majority of the trade, money, and

government in Rome. There were not as many patricians as there

were plebeians. As time passed, the ordinary people of Rome began

to understand that they had power in their numbers. People were

most often upset when there were food shortages. This always made

the patricians very nervous due to large groups of plebeians coming

together to voice their concerns. These times could be chaotic for

everyone involved.

- Discuss the definition of _envy_, and note that _envied_ is used in this chapter.


- Tell students to read **page 53** to themselves to find the answer to the
question: “Who were Damocles and Dionysius, and what did Damocles want?”


- When students have finished reading, restate the questions, and ask
students to answer.


» Dionysius was the king of Syracuse, and Damocles was his friend. Damocles

thought the king had a good life because he had all the riches and power he could

want, and there was nothing better than that. Damocles wanted to live like a king.


- Call students’ attention to the image and caption on **page 54** . Dionysius is

the bearded figure. Damocles is standing next to him. Ask students what they
think Damocles will do the day he is king.


» Answers may vary.

**Grade 3 | Unit 4**
Pausing Point 1


Note to Teacher


This is the halfway mark of the Ancient Rome unit. Your students have
now read and heard the first half of the readings about the Roman Empire,
its history, some of its most influential leaders, and Rome’s lasting
contributions. It is highly recommended that you pause here and spend two
days reviewing, reinforcing, or extending the material taught thus far.


The activities listed below are separated by Whole Group and Independent
activities. You may wish to have students complete the Independent Activities
on their own and use the Choice Menu: Independent Pausing Points Activity
Page (Pausing Point 1) to keep track of their accomplishments. You may
assign student to complete a combination of the activities listed on the Choice
Menu or specify certain activities for individual students. While students are
completing the Choice Menu, you may choose to work with a small group of
students who would benefit from the particular activity.


~~**CORE CONTENT OBJECTIVES UP TO THIS PAUSING POINT**~~


Students will:


  - Explain why ancient Rome was considered a civilization.


  - Identify Rome as the capital of modern-day Italy and the approximate
area where the ancient Roman civilization began.


  - Define the terms _BC_ and _AD._


  - Identify some of the contributions of the ancient Roman civilization

and describe how they have influenced the present.


  - Explain that most ancient Romans believed in many mythical gods
and goddesses.


  - Explain the legend, “The Sword of Damocles,” and explain the lesson that
it teaches.


  - Explain the importance of the Tiber River to the ancient Romans.


  - Identify Roman myths as a type of fiction.


Unit 4


  - Describe the evolution of government in ancient Rome: monarchy to
republic to empire.


  - Describe the Senate as part of the government of the Roman Republic.


  - Explain the significance of the Punic Wars between ancient Rome
and Carthage.


  - Describe the role of Hannibal in the Punic Wars.


  - Compare and contrast the three categories of people in ancient Rome:
patricians, plebeians, and slaves.


  - Describe the everyday life of the ancient Romans.


~~**WHOLE GROUP**~~


**1. Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**


**Materials:** Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard


  - Give students a key unit concept or vocabulary word such as _civilization._
Have them brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear
the word, such as _group of people, organized, living together, have writing_
_systems, have leaders and laws, practice religions, have different people_
_doing different jobs,_ etc. Record their responses on a piece of chart paper, a
chalkboard, or whiteboard for reference.


**2. Multiple-Meaning Word Activity: Favors**


**Materials:** Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard; images depicting the
various meanings of favors (optional)


  - In “Daily Roman Life,” you heard this saying from the poet Virgil: “Fortune
favors the brave.”


  - Say the word _favors_ with me.


  - In the sentence you just heard, _favors_ is a verb that means “prefers” or
“chooses.” You may remember that the saying “fortune favors the brave”
means good fortune—or good luck—prefers people who are brave. Here
is another example of _favors_ as a verb meaning prefers: “My sister favors
ketchup with her scrambled eggs.”


  - You could also say, “I favor mustard on my hot dog” or “She always favored
chocolate sauce on her ice cream.” These are other tenses of the verb _favors._


Pausing Point 1 Ancient Rome
**137**


**138**




 - Can you think of any other meanings for the word _favors_ ? The word _favors_
can be a noun to mean things someone does to help another, such as in this
example: “Piedra was thankful for all the favors Theresa did for her while her
arm was in a cast.” Another example using the singular form is, “Can you
please do me a favor and help straighten the desks?”


 - The word _favors_ has a third meaning. It can be a noun to mean small gifts that
are given by a host or hostess of a party. Who can come up with a sentence that
uses the word _favors_ with this meaning? (An example could be, “Dayna passed
out pencils and flower seeds as party favors when we went to her party.”)


 - What is the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the word
_favors_ ? (noun or a verb)


 - With your neighbor, take turns creating sentences using the word _favors_
and then identifying the meaning and part of speech that has been used.
For example you might say, “Our dog favors my baby brother because he is
always dropping food on the floor.” Your neighbor would say, “ _Favors_ means
‘prefers’ in that sentence, and it is a verb.”


 - (You may wish to write examples of the word _favors_ on chart paper or the
board and/or show images depicting the various meanings of _favors._ )


**3. Riddles for Core Content**

 - Ask students riddles such as the following to review core content:


   - I am a country that is a peninsula in the Mediterranean Sea and am
shaped like a boot. What country am I? (Italy)


   - I am a river in Italy that was very important to the founding of Rome.

because they are famous and have many experiences. The same is true
for Julius Caesar. During partner reading, you read about one part of Julius
Caesars’s life. The Read-Aloud is also going to be about Julius Caesar’s life.
As you listen, you will take notes on the key points of the text and think about
how this Read-Aloud compares to what you just read with a partner.


  - Explain to student that as they listen to the Read-Aloud, they should think
about how the two selections about Julius Caesar are alike and different.

Young Julius Caesar as a soldier


Julius Caesar became a soldier at a young age. Originally, he was

nominated to become a priest of Jupiter, which was a very powerful

religious position in Rome. However, a **feud** erupted between his

family and another important patrician family. As a result, Julius

Caesar left Rome and joined the army instead.

Julius Caesar was a fine soldier,

bravery, he was awarded a Civic Crown, which was a simple crown

**Student Reader pages 64–65**
Young Julius Caesar in politics


After a few years in the army, Julius Caesar returned to Rome and

became involved in politics. The word _politics_ refers to the activities

involved in running a government. In a republic, making laws, going

to war, collecting taxes, and other government actions all require

agreement between various people in the government. In Rome, the

consuls, senators, and other Roman officials all had to work together

to try to solve problems.


However, when it came to governing the areas Rome controlled,

there were always disagreements about what the role of government

should be. In order to get things done, politicians formed an **alliance**

with other politicians who agreed with them. In Roman politics, there

was power in numbers. If a group of politicians formed an **alliance**,

then together they had an easier time convincing other people to go

along with them.


Julius Caesar formed a political **alliance** with another soldier, a very

rich man named Pompey [/pom*pee/]. Together, they set out to gain

the things they wanted, such as land and power. Julius Caesar was

elected to a number of special political offices, even though he had as

many enemies as he had friends. He worked his way up the political

ladder until he finally became one of the two consuls at the top of

the government.

Proconsul Julius Caesar looking

After his term as consul, Julius Caesar

became proconsul of a number of



provinces to the north and east of Italy. Julius Caesar was in charge

of Rome’s northern frontier. As proconsul, he had a number of

Roman legions at his command, and decided that his job was to use

his armies to expand Roman territory farther to the north. In these

northern provinces, the Romans built roads, towns, and temples. One

of Caesar’s jobs as proconsul was to protect Roman property in these

areas. Julius Caesar decided it would be a good idea if he went out

and **conquered** these lands for Rome.


The only problem was that the areas he wanted to **conquer** were full

of what were considered by some as **barbarians** . That is what many

Romans called some of the people who didn’t speak their language

and who had a different culture than theirs. The Romans did not

consider these people to be an advanced society because they did

not have roads, **aqueducts**, massive marble **arenas**, or temples.

The Romans considered these people to be uncultured. To someone

accustomed to the sights and sounds of the vibrant city of Rome and

all that Roman **civilization** had to offer, the homes and lifestyles of

those outside of Rome may have seemed **crude**, or unpolished. To

the common Roman mind, they would be doing these “ **barbarians** ”

a **favor** by **conquering** them and forcing them to adopt Roman ways

and culture.

**158**



Germanic tribes. The Gauls lived in the area of present-day France,

and the Germanic tribes were spread across a large area of central

and northern Europe. Julius Caesar first turned his attention to the

Gauls. He spent much of the next ten years fighting to **conquer**

and control Gaul, but it seemed there was always another Gallic or

Germanic tribe ready to rise up and fight Roman expansion. There

were many Gallic tribes, each following its own king, or chieftain,

and its own set of laws and customs. The Gauls’ way of life was

more **sophisticated** than the Romans expected. The Gallic tribes

often traded and cooperated with each other. They had their own

money, their own religion, and their own traditional stories, songs,

and dances.


**Student Reader pages 70**
Caesar writing his memoirs of Gallic victories


At the time when Julius Caesar was given the province of Gaul

as a proconsul, he needed money to make things happen and to

become further recognized. He also needed to show that he was not

someone to be pushed around by his enemies. He looked at Gaul

as a wonderful opportunity—a massive area of land and people to

**conquer** ! He hoped that because they all answered to their own

chieftains, the Gauls would be easy to divide and **conquer** .

paragraph in response to a prompt. ~~**[ TEKS 3.2.D; TEKS 3.12.C ]**~~


~~**ESTABLISH AN OPINION (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Remind students that an opinion is what someone thinks.


  - Display or project DP.U4.L6.1 with the prompt and outline. Read the prompt
to students.


    - **Prompt:** Daily Roman life differed depending on the type of civilian 
plebeian or patrician. Explain whether you think daily life was better for a
plebeian or a patrician. Support your reasons with evidence from the text.


  - Think-Pair-Share: Share with your partner the task and purpose of the
prompt that we determined in the previous lesson. Ask for a few volunteers
to share their responses.


  - Tell students that since they know what the prompt is asking, they can
formulate their opinion and a plan.


  - Explain to students that they must establish their opinion prior to writing.
Point out that in today’s prompt, they will choose whether a plebeian’s or a
patrician’s daily life is better. Tell students that they should pick their opinion
based on whether they can provide reasons and text evidence.


  - Think-Aloud: First, I will determine my opinion. My opinion is that the
patrician’s daily life was better. Then, I will create a plan to support my
opinion. I will come up with three reasons to explain my opinion based on
the text. One of my reasons from the text is that the patricians lived in large
houses.

reason number two and reason number three.


~~**INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPH (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that since they have established a text supported opinion, they
can begin the writing process.


  - Explain to students that, as a class, they will work together to write a
response, beginning with the introduction paragraph. They will use the
opinion and three reasons on the class plan: DP.U4.L6.1.


  - Display or project DP.U4.L6.2: Introduction Pyramid.


  - Point out to students that a good introduction paragraph begins with a

sentence that captures the reader’s attention. This is called a hook. Next, the
introduction becomes more specific and provides background knowledge on
the topic, or prompt. Finally, the introductory paragraph ends with a thesis,
which is your text supported opinion.


  - Tell students that a hook is the first sentence of the response. A hook has
to engage the reader. The hook also introduces the topic. Some examples
of a good hook can be a detailed description, a question, an exclamation, or
sound words.


  - Think-Aloud: I am going to come up with a question to hook my reader. A
hook has to grab the reader’s attention about the topic. My question has
to relate to the topic of daily life in Rome. My question could be “Could you
imagine daily life in Rome during the time of Julius Caesar?”


    - Write down this example of a hook on the board and label it with the
number one.


  - Think-Pair-Share: Brainstorm a hook with your partner. It can be a question,
a description, an exclamation or sound words. The hook needs to be about
the topic, daily life in Rome.

Vercingetorix leading the rebellion
against Caesar


As you heard in the previous Read
Aloud, Gallic soldiers were not able to

put up much of a fight in some areas,



and so Julius Caesar thought he was going to be able to **conquer** Gaul

quite easily. The Romans thought the people in Gaul were **uncivilized**,

and they wanted to **conquer** them so they would adopt Roman ways

and culture. But the Gauls, led by a powerful Gallic chieftain named

Vercingetorix [ver-sin- _gett_ -oh-ricks], rose up and rebelled against

him. Vercingetorix united several powerful Gallic tribes, and for a few

months it appeared as though the Gauls might be able to succeed

against this Roman **conqueror** .


Unfortunately for the Gauls, Julius Caesar and his legions would not

be easy to **defeat** . Caesar’s men would follow him anywhere. Julius

Caesar was loved by soldiers because he **favored** being out in front of

his army, fighting alongside the common soldiers. His men respected

him for it, even though it may have terrified them to see their leader

so close to danger.

1. **Inferential.** What helped Rome to be victorious over the Gauls?


» The Romans had many men, and they used the latest war technology, including

the ballista; Julius Caesar was a courageous leader with many loyal followers.


2. **Inferential.** You heard that Julius Caesar became the dictator of Rome,

making him very powerful. What is a dictator?


» a ruler who can make decisions without needing the approval of the consuls,

Senate, or anyone else


3. **Evaluative.** How was this different from how the Senate of Rome had

functioned in the past?


» The Senate had functioned by the election of the people; the two consuls had

power to veto a decision and also had to agree with each other in order to keep a

balance of power.


4. **Inferential.** How was Cleopatra important to the Roman civilization?


» Answers will vary but may include that Julius Caesar fell in love with Cleopatra;

he helped her win a civil war in Egypt; Cleopatra agreed to allow Caesar to import

wheat from Egypt into Rome.


5. **Literal.** Julius Caesar continued to expand Rome’s territory, becoming more

and more powerful. What did the jealous senators do?

1. Write the word _uncivilized_ on the board in cursive. Provide an opportunity for

students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed. You may
wish to review syllable division patterns at this time.


2. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “The Romans thought the people in Gaul were
_uncivilized_, and they wanted to conquer them so they would adopt Roman
ways and culture.” _Uncivilized_ means having a complete disregard for or no
knowledge of the proper ways to behave.


3. How do you think someone might act who is considered uncivilized by

others?


4. What part of speech is the word _uncivilized_ ?


5. **Use a Word Parts activity for follow-up.** Write the word _uncivilized_ on a

piece of chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard. Have a student volunteer
circle the prefix _un–_ and define its meaning. Ask students, “What does
_uncivilized_ mean?” Discuss synonyms such as _savage, barbaric,_ and _ill-_
_mannered._ Prompt students to realize that the prefix _un–_ causes the word
to mean the opposite of _civilized,_ or _cultured, polite,_ and _well-mannered._ Ask,
“What other words do you know that use the prefix _un–_ to cause words to
be the opposites, or antonyms, of the word? Share examples such as _unfair,_
_unlikely, uncommon,_ etc.

**Primary Focus:** Students will write three body paragraphs that include text

evidence to support their opinion that patrician daily life is better.

~~**TEKS 3.2.D; TEKS 3.12.C; TEKS 3.13.C; TEKS 3.13.H**~~


~~**FIRST PARAGRAPH (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 6.3. Tell students to reread their

introductory paragraph.




    - Ask students to share the three reasons why patrician daily life was better

than plebeian daily life.


  - Explain to students that each of these reasons will be a body paragraph.

These body paragraphs will explain how patrician daily life was better. Tell
students that within each body paragraph, they will include text evidence and
their own words to better explain their opinion.


  - Tell students that you will model how to write the first body paragraph. Then,
they will work with a partner to write the second body paragraph. Finally, at
the end of the lesson, they will write the third body paragraph independently.


  - _Think-Aloud:_ The first reason we wrote in our thesis was that patricians

had large homes. When I write my body paragraph, I will state my reason,
support it with text evidence and elaborate with my own thinking. I am
going to start by looking in the text for evidence about their homes.
When I looked back in the text, I noticed that it says, “the domus has
several stories with enough rooms for your large household,” whereas
the plebeians lived with their in a small apartment.” I am going to use this
evidence to support my reason. Now, I will write my body paragraph with
my reason, text evidence and explanation.


  - Display or project DP.U4.L6.3. Under the first paragraph begin writing as you
continue thinking aloud.


  - _Think-Aloud (continued):_ I am going to start my paragraph by writing

expansive home.” Then, I will write the text evidence I found. “The text
states that their homes had “several stories with enough rooms for your
large household,” whereas the plebeians lived with their whole family in
“a small apartment.” Finally, I will write to explain the evidence in my own
words. “The patrician’s lifestyle is better than the plebeians because they
had more space and privacy in their homes.


    - Direct students to write this down for the first body paragraph on Activity
Page 6.3.


~~**SECOND PARAGRAPH (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that they will now work with a partner to write their second

body paragraph with their reason, text evidence, and explanation on Activity
Page 6.3.


  - Place students into pairs and direct them to look for evidence for their
second reason. Tell students that it may help to circle or underline the
evidence they find in the text.


    - Facilitate and monitor students as they write their body paragraph. Ask

students to share their explanation. Then, help students locate the text
evidence that would support this explanation.


  - After students have completed their second body paragraph, ask for a few
volunteers to read theirs to the class.


~~**THIRD PARAGRAPH (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Finally, tell students they will write their third body paragraph independently
on Activity Page 6.3. Remind students to include the third reason, text
evidence, and an explanation.

Instead, he would be treated as a **traitor** and an **invader** .


In the year 49 BC, Caesar crossed the Rubicon. He is said to have

remarked in **Latin**, “The die is cast.” That was his way of saying he

knew he was taking a big risk. Crossing the Rubicon meant there was

no turning back.

1. **Evaluative.** Explain how Caesar changed the Roman government when he
was appointed dictator.


» Answers may vary but should include that Rome was a republic for hundreds of

years, and Caesar changed that by being appointed dictator. Instead of being

dictator for a year, he appointed himself dictator for life, which was completely

different than a republic form of government.

when Julius Caesar ruled Rome, he ruled as a dictator, a person who
was not elected and had ultimate control of the government. Then Rome
became an empire.

Marc Antony and Octavian busts


During his life, Julius Caesar had a

few close friends, the closest of which

was Marc Antony. Marc Antony was

a general under Julius Caesar and





helped in the **conquering** of Gaul. Julius Caesar did not have any

sons that could take over his position as ruler of Rome. In his will,

Julius Caesar adopted his eighteen-year-old great-nephew, Octavian,

as his own son. After Caesar’s death, Marc Antony and Octavian

worked together to fight against Julius Caesar’s enemies and **resolve**

some of the **conflict** in the **empire**, at least for a while.


**Student Reader pages 87–88**
Cleopatra with Marc Antony


Marc Antony took it upon himself to make sure Rome and Egypt

continued to be allies, because Rome needed to keep importing

Egypt’s wheat. Plus, Cleopatra’s Egypt was a rich and powerful

country with a strong army—not as powerful as Rome, but still an

important force in the **Mediterranean** area with which to have an

**alliance** . Just as Julius Caesar had done, Marc Antony fell in love

with Cleopatra, and she fell in love with him. In fact, they became

playwright you heard about earlier who wrote the play _Julius Caesar_,

wrote a play about this couple titled _Antony and Cleopatra_ .


Marc Antony and Cleopatra became allies in a struggle for power with

Octavian. Even though Marc Antony and Octavian had worked

together in an **alliance** to end Rome’s **civil war**, they eventually

became enemies.

  - Students are likely to make the following errors: For ‘ee’, students may write ‘e’.


  - For ‘e’, students may write ‘ee.’


  - While the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should still be aware

that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find it helpful to
record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the analysis chart.
For example:


    - Is the student consistently making errors on specific vowels? Which ones?


    - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


    - Is the student consistently making errors on particular
beginning consonants?


    - Did the student write words for each feature correctly?

Marc Antony and Octavian busts


During his life, Julius Caesar had a few close friends, the closest of which was
Marc Antony. Marc Antony was a general under Julius Caesar and helped in the
**conquering** of Gaul. Julius Caesar did not have any sons that could take over
his position as ruler of Rome. In his will, Julius Caesar adopted his eighteenyear-old great-nephew, Octavian, as his own son. After Caesar’s death, Marc
Antony and Octavian worked together to fight against Julius Caesar’s enemies
and **resolve** some of the **conflict** in the **empire**, at least for a while.


Lesson 9 Augustus Caesar



**211**


**212**



1. **Inferential.** Why would it be important for Marc Antony and Octavian to

resolve some of the conflict across the Roman Republic at this time?


» Julius Caesar had just been killed, and Octavian was a new ruler. Rome had been

at war with the Gauls, and it was a time of general unrest.


2. **Inferential.** If Julius Caesar had not adopted his nephew Octavian, what do

you think would have happened in Rome after Caesar’s death?


» Answers may vary but could include that the people would riot, there would be a

different leader chosen, or another country’s leader could take over.


**Student Reader pages 87–88**
Cleopatra with Marc Antony


Marc Antony took it upon himself to make sure Rome and Egypt continued
to be allies, because Rome needed to keep importing Egypt’s wheat. Plus,
Cleopatra’s Egypt was a rich and powerful country with a strong army—not
as powerful as Rome, but still an important force in the **Mediterranean**
area with which to have an **alliance** . Just as Julius Caesar had done, Marc
Antony fell in love with Cleopatra, and she fell in love with him. In fact, they
became one of the most famous couples in history. William Shakespeare,
the playwright you heard about earlier who wrote the play Julius Caesar,
wrote a play about this couple titled Antony and Cleopatra. Marc Antony and
Cleopatra became allies in a struggle for power with Octavian. Even though
Marc Antony and Octavian had worked together in an **alliance** to end Rome’s
**civil war**, they eventually became enemies.


1. **Literal.** Why was having an alliance with Egypt important?


» Egypt was a rich and powerful country with a strong army.


2. **Inferential.** Why would Marc Antony and Octavian eventually become
enemies?


» They both wanted to control the Roman Republic.

to as many places as possible. It makes it easier to keep control of an area if it

shares a culture with the conquering force. Roads also allowed for more trade or

the exchange of goods from those new lands, and in case of rebellion, they could

**221**


One of the most famous buildings built during the
**reign** of Augustus is the Pantheon. The Pantheon was built
as a temple to all the mythical Roman gods. ( _Pan–_ means
all and _theo–_ means gods.) The Pantheon is a beautiful
building with a dome roof. While the original building was
destroyed in a fire, the Pantheon still standing today was
built to replace it. Thousands of tourists visit it every day.


_The Pantheon as it appears in Rome today_


97



The Pantheon is only one of many examples of great
Roman architecture. Another one is the Colosseum.
The Colosseum, built not long after the **reign** of
Augustus, is a huge, oval stadium. The Romans went
to the Colosseum to see people and animals fight. The
Colosseum would hold fifty thousand people. Today the
Colosseum is in ruins, but some of it is left to give us a
good idea of what it would have looked like.


The Colosseum is not just an example of the great
architecture of the Romans, but also an example of
how the conquest of the Roman Empire made that
architecture possible. Roman emperors had conquered
a land far to the east called Judea, home to the Jewish
people. Rome took funds from the Jewish Temple in

Jerusalem and enslaved
thousands of Jewish
people. Those funds and
those slaves largely built
the Colosseum.


_The Arch of Titus is another_
_piece of architecture that_
_resulted from the Roman_
_conquest of Jerusalem._

Roman architecture supported Roman entertainment.
The Romans enjoyed watching **chariot** races. These
were held in an even larger stadium, called the Circus
Maximus. For the Romans, a **chariot** race or a fight was
good entertainment, the way a football game or a movie
is for us today.


_The Romans enjoyed watching_ _**chariot**_ _races at the_

The Romans also built roads and **aqueducts** .
The roads brought people from all around the **Empire** .
The **aqueducts** were used to bring water from the
country into the city. Some of the **aqueducts** are also
very beautiful.

Pausing Point 2


The activities listed below are separated by Whole Group and Independent
activities. You may wish to have students complete the Independent
Activities on their own and use the Choice Menu: Independent
Pausing Points Activity Page (Pausing Point 2) to keep track of their
accomplishments. You may assign student to complete a combination of the
activities listed on the Choice Menu or specify certain activities for individual
students. While students are completing the Choice Menu, you may choose
to work with a small group of students who would benefit from the particular
activity.


~~**WHOLE GROUP**~~


**1. Key Vocabulary Brainstorming**


**Materials:** Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard


  - Give students a key unit concept or vocabulary word such as _legacy._ Have
them brainstorm everything that comes to mind when they hear the word,
such as, _things left behind, inventions, aqueducts, arches, the Latin language,_
_paintings, sculptures,_ etc. Record their responses on a piece of chart paper, a
chalkboard, or whiteboard for reference.


**2. Multiple-Meaning Word Activity: Rough**


**Materials:** Chart paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard; images depicting the
various meanings of rough (optional)


  - In “Roman Mythology,” you heard, “He could also wave it over the stormy
seas and make the _rough_ seas smooth.”


  - Say the word _rough_ with me.


  - The word _rough_ can mean a number of things. In the sentence you just heard,
rough means “not calm”. For example, if the sea is rough there would be
many large waves. (Write “A—Rough: not calm” on the board.)


  - Another example of _rough_ is the description of something that is not smooth.
Sandpaper is an example of something that feels rough. It is uneven or
bumpy. (Write “B—not smoother; uneven or bumpy” on the board.) Ask:
“What are some other things that could be considered rough?”


  - Another meaning of the word _rough_ is something that is difficult or hard to
do. For example, “It was rough to get up so early, but I had to get to the bus


Unit 4


on time.” In addition to working with your teammates toward the vision of
winning the game, you may also imagine that someday when you grow up
you will be a famous soccer player, playing in the World Cup. (Write, “C –
Rough: something that is difficult or hard to do” on the board.)


  - (Write the following sentences on chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard,
and read them aloud to students. For each one, have students select
meaning A, B, or C.)


The long drive to the beach was _rough_, but my mom made it fun by playing car
games the entire way. (C)


When the Pilgrims sailed for America, they encountered _rough_ seas. (A)


This piece of wood was very _rough_ before I sanded it. (B)


  - With your neighbor, take turns creating sentences using the word _rough_ and
identifying the meaning. For example, your neighbor might say, “That road
has lots of potholes. It has a _rough_ surface.” You would say, “ _Rough_ means
uneven or bumpy in that sentence.”


  - (You may wish to show images depicting the various meanings of _rough._ )


**3. Riddles for Core Content**

  - Ask students riddles such as the following to review core content:


    - I am a famous Roman Emperor who took the name of my adopted father,
Julius. Who am I? (Augustus Caesar)


    - I tried to gain power after Julius Caesar died, by teaming up with Queen
Cleopatra of Egypt against Augustus Caesar. Who am I? (Marc Antony)


    - I am an invention of the Romans that carries water from nearby mountains
into Rome. What am I? (an aqueduct)


    - I am one of Rome’s most famous leaders, dictator of Rome, whose last
words were _“Et tu, Brute?”_ Who am I? (Julius Caesar)


    - I am the first Christian emperor of Rome, and the city of Constantinople in

the Eastern Roman Empire was named after me. Who am I? (Constantine
the Great)


    - I am the language of the Romans and the basis of the Romance languages,

such as Spanish, French, and Italian. What language am I? (Latin)

~~**INDEPENDENT**~~


**Note:** The Independent Choice Menu can be found on page 155 in the

Activity Book.


**1. Famous Quotes from Ancient Rome Material: PP.6**

 - Review with students the sayings and phrases they have learned related to

ancient Rome that are commonly used today in their figurative sense:


   - “Veni, vidi, vici!”


   - “crossing the Rubicon”


   - “The die is cast.”


   - “Et tu, Brute?”


   - “Beware the ides of March.”


   - “fiddling while Rome burned”


 - You may wish to have students work independently, in groups, or with a
partner to discuss, explain, research, and/or illustrate these sayings and
phrases and their literal and figurative meanings. You may also wish to show
pertinent images from the Read-Alouds as students discuss. Finally, you may
wish to review again these three sayings from the first half of the unit and
Pausing Point 1:


   - “Rome wasn’t built in a day.”


   - “All roads lead to Rome.”


   - “When in Rome, do as the Romans do.”


 - Using what they have learned about Ancient Rome, have students create

their own sayings and phrases and explain the literal meanings in relation to
ancient Rome and the figurative meanings in relation to life today.


**2. Class Book: Ancient Rome**


**Materials:** Drawing paper, drawing tools


 - Tell the class or a group of students that they are going to make a class book
to help them remember what they have learned thus far in this unit. Have the
students brainstorm important information about Ancient Rome, especially
famous people, events, ingenious inventions, and things from ancient Rome
still used today. You may also encourage students to write about mythical
Roman gods and goddesses, or have them create their own myth based on


Unit 4


ancient Roman beliefs. Have each student choose one idea to draw a picture
of, and ask him or her to write a caption for the picture. Bind the pages to
make a book to put in the class library for students to read again and again.


**3. Writing Prompts**


**Material:** PP.7


  - Students may be given an additional writing prompt such as the following:


    - “The most interesting thing I’ve learned thus far is because .”


    - “The Romans were ingenious because . ”


    - “The most important legacy of ancient Rome is because .”


    - “If I could meet any of the ancient Roman leaders, I would want to meet
because .”


**4. You Were There: Ancient Rome**

  - Have students pretend that they are living back in the time of the Ancient
Roman Empire. They may wish to be in a battle with Julius Caesar, a citizen
of Rome while it was being invaded, someone living during the _Pax Romana_,
or someone just walking the streets of Rome in a toga and sandals. Ask
students to describe what they see and hear. For example, for the battle
alongside Caesar, students may talk about Julius Caesar being a skilled
leader, watching the Roman war machines at work, and the differences
between the Roman soldiers and those they are fighting. Consider
also extending this activity by adding group or independent writing
opportunities associated with the “You Were There” concept. For example,
ask students to pretend they are newspaper reporters who have conducted
an interview with Julius Caesar, and have them write a group news article
describing his thoughts.


**5. Grammar Review**


**Materials:** PP.8


  - Fill in the “What is it? What was it? Riddles”; choose past, present, or future
tense verbs to match the sentences; create sentences

affixed words


**8. What did you learn?**


**Materials:** Lined paper


                 - Write down the top 10 facts you learned about ancient Rome.


**9. Create a Survey**


**Material:** Blank paper


                 - Design a survey to find out how much other students like learning about

ancient Rome. Make up five questions and ask five people your questions.
show the results of your survey on a graph.


**10. Independent or Partner Reading**


**Materials:** Reader


                 - Read Chapter 17: Monarchy vs. Republic in the Reader. If students are
reading in partners, have them discuss the different systems of government
and how they are similar and different. If students read the chapter
independently, have them write a summary of the text.

Map of the Roman Empire


Over hundreds of years, the Roman

Empire stretched across many

different lands and included many

different groups of people. As the

Romans conquered more land, they tried to spread their culture and

**customs** . However, the Romans themselves were also changed by the

cultures of the people they ruled. One group of people in a far-flung

corner of the empire ended up having a major impact on the Romans.

Judea, 1st century BC


Judea was a land that sat at the far

eastern edge of the Roman Empire,

and is in the general area of some of

the modern-day country of Israel.

Judea was the homeland of the Jewish people. Over more than a

thousand years, Jews sometimes ruled this land directly, but they

had also been subject to different conquering empires. The Romans

were another in a long line of conquering powers.


**TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text.



Support


Reread the sentence, “One
group of people in a farflung corner of the empire

Explain the phrase “farflung corner.”



Lesson 10 “Christianity and the Roman Empire”
**243**


Jewish people practice a religion known as Judaism. Judaism is based

around a series of religious texts called the Tanakh, or the Hebrew Bible.

The Hebrew Bible stresses belief in one God and describes that the

proper way to connect to God is through just and ethical action. The

Jewish religious practice of worshiping a single God was very different

from the Roman practice of worshiping many different gods.


As is true with any religious texts, there have been different

interpretations of the Hebrew Bible. Some interpreted the texts that

there would be a coming **Messiah**, or an anointed or chosen one set

apart for a special purpose. During the time of the Roman Empire,

some in the Jewish faith believed this Messiah would come to free the

Jewish people from Roman rule.


The Romans could apply very strict rules to the people they

conquered, and that was no different for the Jews of Judea under

Roman rule. Jews were still permitted to practice their religious

beliefs, but life was often very hard for them. Romans took Jews

captive as slaves and took money they had saved for religious

purposes. Jewish leaders in Judea organized several rebellions to try

to break free of Roman rule. The Jewish people from the small region

of Judea had an outsized impact on the empire.


                       - **Read-Aloud Pause:** Reread, “The Jewish religious practice of worshiping a

single God was very different from the Roman practice of worshiping many
different gods.” Explain how this difference could cause conflict.


**Show Image U4.L10.3:**
Jesus of Nazareth from DaVinci’s
The Last Supper


Two thousand years ago, when Augustus

Caesar ruled the Roman Empire, a Jewish

man who lived in Judea would ultimately

have a very significant impact on the

history of the empire and beyond. His name was Jesus of Nazareth. The

Roman historian Josephus described some of Jesus’s life and his death

at the hands of Roman authorities.

Unit 4
**244**


Other texts were also written about Jesus after his death and brought

together as the New Testament. They were grouped with the texts

of the Hebrew Bible, which were organized as the Old Testament.

Together, they formed the Christian Bible.


These New Testament texts of the Christian Bible describe what modern

Christians believe to be the circumstances surrounding the birth of

Jesus, celebrated today as Christmas. According to the New Testament

texts, a Jewish woman named Mary was told by an angel that she had

found **favor** with God. The angel explained that she would have a son

who would be called Jesus, and that this was the Messiah referenced in

the Hebrew Bible.


- **Read-Aloud Pause:** We have talked about the definition of **favor** before. What
does it mean here when the text said that Mary had found favor with God?


» It means she is supported or liked by God.


**Show Image U4.L10.4:**
Map of Bethlehem


According to the Christian Bible, on

the day Jesus was born, his mother

Mary and father Joseph were traveling

to the town of Bethlehem to register

for the **census** . The census, ordered

by the Roman government, required Roman citizens to be counted

and their names registered. This was used in part to help the empire

know how many people needed to pay taxes and is a practice

continued by governments to this day.


When Mary and Joseph arrived in Bethlehem, they were told there were

no rooms available to rent. They took shelter in a nearby **stable**, a type

of barn where animals are kept. When Jesus was born, Mary wrapped

him in pieces of cloth and laid him in a **manger**, which is a long wooden

or stone box used for horses and cattle to eat animal feed. This story

of Jesus’s birth in a stable is commonly featured as part of displays put

on by Christians even today during the Christmas holidays each year.



Challenge


How would a government
use a census to make
decisions for the people?



Lesson 10 “Christianity and the Roman Empire”
**245**


                       - **Read-Aloud Pause:** According to the text, why was this child born in a

stable?


» His parents had to travel to register for the census, and there were no places to

stay other than a stable.


The Christian Bible explains that throughout his life, Jesus taught about

God’s love and forgiveness, and performed many miracles. For many

early Christians and Christians today, accounts of miracles performed

by Jesus are an important part of their beliefs, and it encouraged a rapid

spreading of the faith. Some of these miracles included healing the sick,

walking on water, and calming a raging storm.


Check for Understanding


What kinds of messages do Christians believe that Jesus taught about?


» Christians believe Jesus taught about God’s love and forgiveness.


                 - Remind students that they are going to identify where there is text evidence

that shows how beliefs about Jesus of Nazareth made an impact on the
Roman Empire. Point out that they have just heard that there was a rapid
spreading of the faith. Ask them to predict how this might have begun
impacting ancient Rome.


» Answers may vary but should include that if large numbers of people began to

follow Jesus, the Romans might abandon their beliefs in many gods and stop

worshiping at Roman temples.


The Christian Bible says that a growing number of people became

followers of Jesus. But there were also people who were angry that

Jesus was spreading a religious message that went against their beliefs.

Some people in positions of power in that part of the Roman Empire

were upset that Jesus was worshiped by so many. They wanted Jesus

gone. They began thinking of ways to stop people from following him.


Unit 4
**246**


Check for Understanding


According to the text, why did some people want Jesus gone?


» Those in power were upset that so many worshiped Jesus.


**Show Image U4.L10.5:**
Roman official


The Christian Bible explains that Jesus

told his closest **disciples**, or followers,

that he would soon be killed, but that

he would rise from the dead three days

later. Not long after that, Jesus was arrested by the Roman authorities.

Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of the region, made the decision to

have Jesus sentenced to death by crucifixion.


The Christian Bible explains that Jesus rose from the dead. Three days

after his death by the Roman authorities, followers of Jesus visited his

tomb and found it empty. An angel appeared and said he has risen and

led them into the tomb. When the visitors entered the tomb, they found

it empty. The Roman historian Josephus noted that Jesus had many

disciples at the time of his death by Pilate: “But those who had become

his disciples did not abandon his discipleship. They reported that he had

appeared to them three days after his crucifixion and that he was alive.” [1 ]


In the years that followed, many heard believers’ stories about the

**resurrection** of Jesus, that he had risen from the dead, and word

spread throughout the empire. These early followers of Jesus grew to a

large group of believers. They eventually became known as Christians,

calling Jesus “the Christ,” which was the Greek word for Messiah, and

worshiping Jesus as the Son of God. Over time, these early Christians

developed many new customs, including eventually celebrating the

event of the resurrection as Easter.

Early Christians endured **persecution**

from the Romans, meaning that they

were treated badly for their beliefs.

Some Christians were put in jail, some

others were exiled, or forced to leave

their homelands, and some were put to death. Some were forced to

fight lions in the Colosseum. During this time, Christians had to meet

in secret to worship God.

**Show Image U4.L10.7:**
Constantine


In spite of the persecution, for

several hundred years, more people

throughout the Roman empire began

converting to Christianity. Eventually,

this reached the center of Roman power. Constantine was emperor of

Rome between 306 AD and 337 AD, and was the first Roman emperor

to convert to the new religion. He legalized Christianity in Rome and

began providing formal government support for the religion.

Unit 4
**248**


Throughout its history, Rome went through many changes, but

maybe none so great as the transformation that followed the life of

Jesus of Nazareth. For nearly one thousand years, the core of Roman

religious life had been to worship many different gods, continuing

the beliefs of the ancient Greeks. Much of Roman culture was built

around those religious beliefs. But those religious beliefs were

completely upended. Rome would never be the same.


 - Ask students to identify text evidence that shows how beliefs about Jesus of

Nazareth made an impact on the Roman Empire.

Roman aqueduct


The Roman Empire was **renowned**

for its architecture, engineering,

and technology. Great buildings

like the Colosseum, construction of

**aqueducts**, and even certain building materials like concrete were

incredible developments that came from the Roman Empire. Even

roads were a new technology in ancient Rome. Before Rome, in most

places, traveling long distances was extremely difficult. Most people

rarely traveled outside of their home cities. There were no well-built

roads. Instead, there were only dirt trails used mostly for walking.

different without them?

**Show Image U4.L11.2:**
All roads lead to Rome


When the Romans conquered

a country, they built roads. The

roads were built to be very strong,

sometimes including concrete. They

were much easier to travel on than

the previous dirt trails. The roads were made to connect to each

other throughout the empire. Since they were all connected, it could

be said that all roads lead to Rome. These roads allowed Romans

to travel great distances to trade goods, and it allowed the Roman

Empire to move their army when needed.

Check for Understanding


How were Roman roads important to the empire?


» Answers may vary but should include that they helped transport

the Roman army, goods, people, and ideas over long distances.


**Show Image U4.L11.3:**
Roman roads


Because the roads helped people to

travel farther than ever before, ideas

could spread faster, too. This included

the ideas of early Christians. The

primary idea spread by those Christians was that Jesus died and was

resurrected in order to forgive people for their sins, or harmful behaviors

that separate a person from God. Roman religious beliefs focused on

the idea that individuals must worship many different gods, depending

on what the individuals needed at different points in their lives. While

Christianity was spreading on the roads of the Roman Empire, many

people with different religious beliefs disagreed with these Christian

ideas and **persecuted** early Christians.

Several texts of the New Testament of the Christian Bible were

written about or by a man who came to be known as Paul. According

to the Bible, Paul was a formal citizen of Rome and traveled often on

Roman roads.

How would this story have

The Christian Bible explains that when he was a young man, Paul

believed that Christians should be **persecuted** for their beliefs. Paul

traveled on Roman roads to find, arrest, and punish Christians. Many

Christians feared him. Roman roads were a key tool to allow Paul and

others like him to impose Roman power and culture, as well as certain

religious beliefs, on people all over the Empire. One day, Paul was

traveling on the road to Damascus. Damascus was a major city in that

part of the Roman Empire, and it was, and still is, the capital of Syria.

According to the Christian Bible, Paul experienced a vision from

Jesus on the road to Damascus, was blinded, and then was able to

see again. From that point forward, the entire focus of his life became

to spread the message of Christianity.


**Show Image U4.L11.4:**
The Apostle Paul, Rembrandt


The Christian Bible describes Paul as

a changed man, traveling from city

to city along many different Roman

roads, and sometimes by boat. He

would meet with new groups of people in towns far from where he

began. He would travel to cities in the empire where the Romans

had constructed beautiful temples to various Roman gods, but

he would preach the messages of Christianity. Many people in the

Empire ended up becoming a Christian as a result. Before his vision

on the road to Damascus, he would persecute Christians, but now,

he traveled far and wide and was himself persecuted, even spending

time in Roman jails because of his new religious beliefs. He wrote

several letters detailing his experiences, many of which became parts

of the New Testament of the Christian Bible. But, when he could, he

continued to travel, even making it to Rome. All roads did indeed lead

to Rome, and it was along these roads that the ideas of Christianity

would travel and ultimately transform the empire.

~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (5 MIN.)**~~


1. **Inferential.** How did Paul change from the beginning of the story to the end?


» At the beginning of the story, Paul persecuted Christians for their beliefs. Paul

changed when he had a vision from Jesus, was blinded, and then healed of

blindness. He stopped persecuting Christians and instead traveled all over to

spread the word of Christianity.


2. **Literal.** How did Rome’s elaborate road system impact Paul’s journey?


» Paul was able to travel easily on well-maintained roads. This helped him travel

faster and farther than if the roads had been made of dirt.


Which sentence from the text supports your answer?


» “Because the roads helped people to travel farther than ever before, ideas could

spread faster, too.”


3. **Inferential.** You read, “All roads did indeed lead to Rome, and it was along

these roads that the ideas of Christianity would travel and ultimately

transform the empire.” What does “transform the empire” mean?


» The spread of Christianity changed the Roman Empire because many people now

changed to believing in one God instead of many gods. They would no longer need

the beautiful Roman temples to many gods.


4. **Inferential.** Why was Paul important in terms of impacting Rome, and how is

he still important today?


» He traveled extensively along Roman roads to share the messages of

Christianity, leading to many Romans becoming Christians. He also wrote many

letters that became some of the books of the New Testament that is still read by

Christians today.

**Chatter’s**



For the next few centuries after Augustus, different
emperors came and went. Some of them were good
leaders, and some were not. Roman emperors would
sometimes spend large amounts of money on chariot races
or gladiator games and other **luxuries** . Many would not
spend enough on things that made the Romans safe. For
hundreds of years, most continued to actively persecute
Christians.


One example was the emperor Nero. Nero came to
power about 40 years after the death of Augustus. Under
Nero’s rule, most of the capital city was destroyed. It was
remembered as the Great Fire of Rome. The fire started
in the market near the Circus Maximus. It quickly spread
and destroyed most of the city. Emperor Nero was known

The Republic expanded and so

became an empire. He built up

strengthened. He brought in a
time of relative peace. And during

_Roman leader_

his reign, Jesus of Nazareth was
born at the edge of the empire, marking the beginning of
what would become the Christian religion.

Proud, sad gentlewoman patrician on

It is time to imagine, once again, that

you are a citizen of ancient Rome.

Imagine that you are an older Roman,

such as this woman in the image, who lived a hundred years after

Constantine the Great and five hundred years after Augustus Caesar.

You come from a proud Roman family, able to trace your roots to the

kings who ruled before the Roman Republic. You live with your family

in a large home in the heart of the city. As a wealthy patrician, you are

well-educated. You know Rome’s history. You know everything there

is to know about Julius Caesar, Augustus Caesar, Constantine the

Great, and so many of the great Roman emperors.


It is the year 455 AD. Tonight, you are sitting on the veranda of your

domus as you do every night. Normally, you would enjoy the view of

your beloved city, watching the sun set over the beautiful buildings

and crowded streets. On this evening, however, there are tears in

your eyes. Normally, you would hear the pleasant conversations

of your neighbors in the streets below, and you would hear your

grandchildren playing in the gardens around your domus. Instead,

tonight, you hear frightening sounds that you hope never to hear

again—sounds that strike terror and sadness in your heart. You hear

the sounds of warfare.

the sounds of warfare. How would you feel, and what would you do?

You know what it sounds and looks

like when a city is invaded by a foreign

You also witnessed a frightful,

fearsome enemy called the Huns,

who were led by a general named

Attila, invade from the East, roaring

across Germany and invading Roman

territories. The Huns were famous horsemen, and they left a trail of

destruction everywhere they went. Eventually, Attila made it all the way

to Italy, but fortunately for Rome, he and his armies didn’t reach Rome.


To make matters worse, as Attila the Hun was invading Europe,

countless people were forced to move away from their homes. They

found themselves squeezed between Attila the Hun and the Roman

Vandals’ invasion route


One of these tribes, the Vandals,

had been forced from the Germanic

regions. The Vandals invaded parts

of the Roman Empire in Gaul, Spain,

and then North Africa. They conquered the city of Carthage, and

then they turned attention to Rome itself. The Vandals crossed the

Mediterranean from Africa and invaded Italy. Then, they pushed their

way deep into the heart of Italy. Thousands of Vandals descended

upon the city of Rome, and their only goal was to destroy it.

Romans fleeing the city


Luckily, most of your family members

had time to leave their homes before

the Vandals’ **invasion** . Some will go

to the island of Sicily. They may not

be safe there either, because the Vandals seem to be everywhere

in nearby Italy. Most of your family will head east, sailing across the

sea to the city of Constantinople. There, you and your family hope

to make a new start. As the Vandals move closer to your home, you

wonder to yourself, “Where are the powerful Roman legions of old?

Why are there no legionaries to protect us?” Long gone are the proud

Roman legions under the leadership of Julius Caesar.

Imagine you are a
mercenary soldier. Would
you risk your life to fight for

another country?


» Remind students that

because Rome had
mercenary soldiers, Rome

did not train Roman
citizens to fight. When the

mercenary soldiers left,
no one in the country was
ready or prepared to fight.

Mercenary soldiers


The sad fact is that you know exactly

how this happened. You’ve expected it

for many years. So much has changed

since the days of Augustus Caesar.

The Pax Romana—Roman peace—brought two hundred years of

peace and prosperity throughout the empire, but it also changed the

way Romans lived and governed their lands. Maintaining legionaries

is expensive. It costs a lot to train, feed, and arm thousands of

soldiers all over the vast Roman Empire. To save money, Roman

emperors and generals hired **mercenaries**, soldiers who will fight for

any country or group for money. Many of these soldiers were not even

Roman citizens. Instead of relying on **hordes** of Roman legionaries,

Rome had come to rely on a smaller amount of **mercenaries**, the

very people they thought of as barbarians, to fight for Rome. When

Attila the Hun and other invaders threatened the Roman provinces,

these **mercenaries** were not willing to fight and die to protect Rome,

because they were not true Roman citizens. Sometimes, you think

maybe the emperors and senators have become just as bad as the

**mercenaries** and other people who have been called barbarians.

Many seem so greedy and selfish, not thinking about what is best for

Rome. For years, they have drained Rome’s resources to pay for their

games, their feasts, and monuments to themselves. All the while,

these leaders failed to prepare for the enemy **invasions** .

Nero fiddling while Rome burns


Constantine had united the empire,

restoring the glory of Rome as it had

been under Augustus. But since his

death, the empire has split apart

again, after years of emperors who focused only on themselves.

Constantinople was still strong, but it was an empire all to itself in the

east. It was far from your home city, and its armies would not fight

to defend the city of Rome in an empire that had been split in half.

With the decline in Roman leadership in the Western Empire, it’s not

too surprising to see the Vandals climbing the city’s crumbling walls.

For years, the barbarian hordes have been gathering in all directions,

preparing for invasion. Instead of dealing with Rome’s threats, the

last several emperors of Rome have seemed more like the hated

emperor Nero. They’ve all “fiddled while Rome burned,” meaning they

have ignored the real problems of Rome while continuing on with

their normal activities as if nothing were wrong.

The once-mighty citizens of Rome

barely learn their history anymore. Rarely do children understand

_Witnessed_ means saw or observed an action as it was being done or taking
place. Using the viewing boxes they made, Pilar and Charlie witnessed a solar
eclipse as the moon passed between the sun and Earth.


3. Ask the students to describe an event that they witnessed recently. Where
were they? What happened? They should be sure to use the word _witnessed_

Things got worse and worse. The **invaders** even attacked

_will say_ (to show future tense)


- Point out that the suffix _-ed_ was not added to say to make the past tense

verb but rather a new word (said) was used. Point out that say is the same for

                 - Read the spelling words once more.


                  - As students to write the following sentences in cursive as you dictate them:


                        - He bravely stepped into the stadium.


                        - The tour leader guided the group through the museum.


                  - Note: At a later time, you may find it helpful to use the template provided
at the end of this lesson to analyze students’ mistakes. This will help you to
understand any patterns that are beginning to develop or that are persistent
among individual students. ~~**TEKS 3.2.B.i**~~


**Spelling Analysis Directions**


Unit 4, Lesson 13


                  - Students are likely to make the following errors:


                        - For ‘ea’, students may write ‘i’, ‘ie’, or ‘ae’


                        - For ‘ie’, students may write ‘i’, ‘ea’, or ‘ae’


                        - For ‘i’, students may write ‘ea’, ‘ie’, or ‘ae’


                 - While any of the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should be

aware that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find it
helpful to record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the
analysis chart. For example: Is the student consistently making errors on
specific vowels? Which ones?


                        - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of words?


                        - Is the student consistently making errors on particular beginning

consonants?


                        - Did the student write words for each feature correctly?


**TEKS 3.2.B.i** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by spelling multisyllabic words with closed syllables, open syllables,
VCe syllables, vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs, r-controlled syllables, and final stable syllables.


Unit 4
**302**


~~**GRAMMAR: SUFFIXES -Y AND -AL (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that they will continue to study root words and suffixes
this week.


 - Write on the board: _A suffix is a syllable placed after a root word. Suffixes_
_change the meaning of the root word._


 - Tell students that the two suffixes they will study this week are _–y_ and _–al_ .


 - Explain that _–y_ means “full of” and is pronounced /ee/. The suffix _–al_ means
“related to” and is pronounced / / + /l/.


 - Tell students that this week’s root words are nouns. When this week’s suffixes
are added to the root words, the new words are adjectives. Adjectives are
words that describe nouns.


 - Write the word _dirt_ on the board. Briefly discuss the meaning of the word and
then use it in a sentence (soil; I have dirt on my t-shirt from playing football).


 - Add the suffix _–y_ to dirt and have students read the suffix, read the new
word, and then discuss the meaning of the new word (full of soil).


 - Ask students to provide examples of things that could get _dirty_ .


» Answers may vary.


 - Write the word _nutrition_ on the board. Briefly discuss the meaning of the
word and then use it in a sentence (the process of eating the right kind of
food so you can be healthy and grow properly; good nutrition includes eating
fruits and vegetables instead of junk food).


 - Add the suffix _–al_ to nutrition and have students read the suffix, read the new

word, and then discuss the meaning of the new word (related to the process
of eating the right kind of food so you can be healthy and grow properly).


 - Ask students to provide examples of things that are _nutritional_ .

**Unit 4 | Lesson 1**
**The Founding of Rome**





How did the city of Rome get its start? One story is that Rome

was founded, or started, by the twins Romulus and Remus.


According to the myth, Princess Rhea Silvia gave birth to twin boys

named Romulus and Remus. Their father was the mythical Roman

god of war, Mars. You might also know him by his Greek name, Ares.


Rhea was the daughter of Numitor, the king of Alba Longa.

Numitor had been forced from his throne by his brother

Amulius. Amulius was afraid that the twins would grow up and

take control of the kingdom. The boys were put in a basket and

sent down the Tiber River. Miraculously, they survived!


The river’s waters carried them to a fig tree growing on the

river bank. There, a she-wolf and a woodpecker fed the boys.

The twins were rescued by a shepherd, who raised them.


When they grew up, Romulus and Remus returned to Alba

Longa. They helped their grandfather Numitor become king

again. Later, they built the city of Rome at the place where

they had been rescued from the river. The Tiber River still runs

through Rome today.


Unfortunately, this story doesn’t have the happiest ending. Romulus

wanted more power. He built a city wall to get rid of Remus. For a

while, Romulus ruled with the leader of a nearby group of people

called the Sabines. Then, he disappeared in a storm. Some people

say that he became the immortal Roman god Quirinus.


It’s hard to know for sure which parts of this story might be true.

The story of brother against brother is common in many Greek

and Roman myths. So is the story of the fearful ruler who tries to

protect their power. Over the years, people who retold the stories

of real historical figures may have added their own details, so we

may never know the true story of how Rome got its start.





Unit 4

**Unit 4 | Lesson 5**
**What Did Ancient Romans Eat?**





What were daily mealtimes like in ancient Rome? A plebeian

might eat vegetables with cheese and bread. The bread would

have been made from wheat or barley, like today’s multigrain

bread. Protein would usually come from peas, beans, or

seafood. Beef was expensive, so it wasn’t in every dish.


Dishes might be spicy or salty. The Romans liked fresh herbs

and pepper. Many people seasoned their food with a fish

sauce called garum. It might have tasted a bit like anchovies.

The Romans wrote down some of these recipes. We can still

see the old recipes today.


Wealthy patrician Romans ate differently. Their meals included

poultry and even songbirds. Would you like to taste peacock

or flamingo? The wealthiest patricians did! They also liked to

eat dormice, or tiny rodents. The Romans stuffed them with

sausage and spices. For them, this was a delicacy, or luxurious

treat.


The Romans liked sweets too, just as we do. The taste of

sweetness often came from honey or fruits, like dates or

grapes. Little cakes or cookies with sesame seeds were both

sweet and nutty.


Some people ate at home. Others bought food at street

vendors or bakeries in the city. Two things they didn’t eat were

pizza and spaghetti. We now think of those as typical foods

that come from Italy, where modern-day Rome is located.

However, tomatoes did not come to Rome until about the

1400s. The ancient Romans didn’t eat them at all.

**All About the Pantheon**





You might think of concrete as something modern. After all,

it’s in many cities. But it’s actually ancient! The Romans made

concrete many centuries—or hundreds of years—ago. Roman

concrete was made from a mix of seawater, lime, and ash from

volcanoes.


Roman concrete can be seen in an ancient temple called the

Pantheon. Its concrete dome is the largest in the world. You

might think all that concrete would be heavy, and you would

be right. The dome weighs nearly 5,000 tons. The concrete

coffers, or building blocks, were carefully placed in rings so

that the blocks pressed against each other to stay in place.


Inside the Pantheon, there is more beauty to behold. The

marble floor and walls are decorated with paintings and small

nooks which hold statues. The domed ceiling used to be

covered in bronze, but now it is bare. In the 1600s, the bronze

was removed and used to make weapons and decorations.


The Pantheon does not have windows. At the top of the dome

is the oculus, a round hole. It lets light into the building. It also

lets in rain, so the floor has a cleverly built drain. During the

day, a circle of light creeps around the inside.


Many of the magnificent buildings of ancient Rome are ruins

now. The Pantheon is not. This is partly because it has been

used since it was built. It became a church. It is also a place

where great artists and saints of the past are buried. People

still get married there today. The Pantheon can feel quite

empty. Even in a crowd, you might feel as though you are alone

with the circle of sky you can see through the oculus.
