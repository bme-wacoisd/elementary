**Introduction to**
_**Living in Colonial**_
_**America**_



Are you ready to go on an adventure? Are you ready
to become a time traveler? I think I heard you say, “Yes!”
Good, because you are about to travel back in time to
meet some of the first Europeans who came to settle in
America. You are going to learn about the **creation** of
the thirteen English colonies.


You already know about the explorers who traveled
to and settled in North America. Now, you will learn
about the people who came to live in the “New World.”
The settlers called this land the “New World” because,
even though it was already inhabited by Native Americans,
the land was new to them. Some of the characters in the
stories you are about to read are not much older than
you. You will also learn about some ways the arrival of
these settlers impacted the Native Americans already
living in America.


You will also discover that these **colonies** were
divided up into three **distinct** regions. These regions are



2


3


called the Southern, New England, and Middle Atlantic
regions. English people, and other Europeans, came to
these regions at different times and for different reasons.
You will learn about one region at a time. Pay attention
to which region you are in.


Be very careful though: Your mission requires you to
travel from one region to another. In each region, you
will meet children who lived a long time ago. You will
discover how different their lives were in comparison to
yours. You might even wonder if you would have liked to
live in America hundreds of years ago, when Europeans
first began to settle here.


For your journey, you will be given special tools to
help you along the way. You will also have a timeline.


As you read, you will find out where these European
settlers **originally** came from, as well as how they
journeyed to America. You will discover the reasons why
they chose to travel so far away from their homes.


Are you ready to begin? Good! Your adventure is
about to begin.

the long stretch of sandy beach

It was late August in the year 1587, and, if all went well,
they and the other travelers would be the first successful
English colonists in North America. They and others
had watched as their leader, John White, sailed away.
He was returning to England to get the supplies they
needed to survive on this island. However, the reason
why the boys were playing on this beach began many
years earlier.



8


_Robert and George played on the beach on Roanoke Island._

In the 1500s, Spain conquered large areas of Central
and South America. Spanish colonists built towns and
cities there, claiming the land as their own. Spanish
galleons sailed across the Atlantic Ocean laden with gold
and other natural resources taken from these regions.
Spain was becoming very rich. The Queen of England,
Elizabeth I, and her favorite knight, Sir Walter Raleigh,
wanted England to become as rich and powerful as
Spain. They wanted English people to go to this place
they called the “New World” too.


In 1584, Sir Walter Raleigh **persuaded** Queen
Elizabeth to let him try to create an English **colony** in
the Americas. It was decided that the English would stay
away from the powerful Spanish conquistadors. Instead
of sailing to Central or South America, they would sail
north, to North America. With that decided, a group of
explorers set off to find a suitable place to settle.



10


11


The explorers who went on this expedition in 1584
reported back to Sir Walter Raleigh and told him about
Roanoke Island. Speaking highly of the land they
encountered, they believed this island was a perfect
place for the first English **colony** . Sir Walter Raleigh's
explorers managed to build a fort on the island to protect
themselves from possible attacks from outsiders, but they
failed to create a **colony** . They abandoned their mission,
leaving only fifteen men behind to guard the fort.
However, Sir Walter Raleigh was determined to succeed.
In 1587, more ships set out for this territory.


Robert and George were members of this second
group of would-be English colonists. They had been very
excited to set off on this great adventure. This time, the
colonists planned to land north of Roanoke Island, in
the Chesapeake Bay area. There, they hoped to establish
the first successful English **colony** .



12


13


Unfortunately, during the trip, there was a
disagreement between their leader John White and
members of the ship’s crew. As a result, members of the
ship’s crew refused to take the English travelers to the
Chesapeake Bay area. So, Robert, George, and the other
passengers were forced to land on Roanoke Island in late
July. Robert and George had not minded this change
of plan. They had simply been happy to be on solid
ground once more.


However, this was not the end of the travelers’
troubles. After landing, John White led a group of
men to Fort Raleigh, the fort that had been built by
the previous group. Robert and George had not been
allowed to go with the men. At the fort, John White
and the other men expected to find the fifteen English
soldiers who had been left behind to guard it. When
they arrived at the fort, the soldiers were nowhere to be
found. The fort was **overgrown** with weeds.



14


_John White and his group found the fort_ _**overgrown**_ _with weeds._



15


When John White and the men returned to the
beach with this news, Robert and George had felt scared.
The boys wondered what had happened to the soldiers.
The only good news was that it was possible to repair the
homes in Fort Raleigh.


The settlers got to work. Robert, George, and
more than one hundred men, women, and children
worked from sunrise to sunset to reconstruct these
homes. However, the boys and the other settlers found
it **alarming** that, when winter came, they did not have
enough food to survive until spring. They had arrived at
a time when it was too late to plant crops.



16


_Men, women, and children reconstructed the fort._



17


Robert, George, and the others did not want to
return to England starving and exhausted. They needed
a plan. One month after they arrived, it was decided
that John White would take one of the two remaining
ships and return to England to get supplies. If all went
well, he would be back before the **harshest** days of
winter arrived.


So Robert and George had watched and played as
John White’s ship sailed out of sight. The two boys
remained on the sandy shore and enjoyed the freedom
offered by the land that was new to them. Neither of the
boys missed the busy, crowded streets of Portsmouth,
England. They did not miss the rain or the sight of the
poor people who begged on the streets. This was to be
their new home and they were thankful to be there. The
question was, would they survive?

**[Jamestown, Part I: ]**
**A New Life**
# **3**



“Tom, hurry up and eat your
breakfast. You should have been out
in the tobacco fields at least an hour
ago,” urged Ann Tucker.





“I’m coming,” Tom replied as he **gulped** down his
milk and bread. “I’ve been helping Jane collect the eggs.”


“Well, hurry up,” Mrs. Tucker commanded. “The
sun will have set before you have lifted a finger to help
Mr. Tucker.”


Tom swallowed the last mouthful of bread and raced
out of the small house. He could tell that Mrs. Tucker
was angry. The bright sunshine made him **squint** as he
ran toward the tobacco fields. It was harvest time, and
almost everyone was working in the fields.


Mrs. Tucker glanced at Tom as he ran off. She
sighed deeply.



20


_Tom hurried to the tobacco field to work with Mr. Tucker._



21


She and her husband Daniel Tucker were now in
charge of Tom and his sister, Jane. They were good
children, but they had arrived with very few skills.
Fortunately, Tom was proving to be a good hunter.


Like the Tuckers, Tom and Jane were from London,
England. Both children had arrived in Jamestown,
Virginia, five months earlier, in April, 1618. When they
first arrived, it was clear that they didn’t want to be
there. For days, they refused to speak. They cried all the
time. Their clothes were **tattered** and grimy, and they
were very thin.


Tom, Jane, and one hundred other children had
sailed to Jamestown on an English trading ship. Sailing
across the ocean is never a good experience. But that was
not the only reason why they looked so raggedy when
they first arrived. Tom and Jane had been street children.
In England, their parents had died, and they had been
found trying to survive on the streets of London. In fact,
all of the children who were sent to Jamestown had been
living that way.



22


_Tom and Jane’s arrival at the Tuckers’ home_



23


Times were hard in England. There were hundreds
of children begging on the streets of London. The king
of England, James I, thought that so many homeless
children would lead to trouble. He had the children
rounded up and shipped 3,000 miles across the Atlantic
Ocean to Jamestown.


Families in the **colony** had agreed to take the
children in and put them to work. After all, there was
certainly a lot to be done. People were needed in the
fields. The colonists grew corn, squash, pumpkins, and
tobacco. They had to hunt and fish as well. In addition,
children were needed to cook, sew, make candles, and
make soap. Boys and girls were needed to look after
the cattle, goats, horses, and pigs that the colonists had
brought with them. Children also cared for fruit trees
and berry bushes.



24


_Colonial children working_



25


The English colonists had first arrived in Jamestown,
Virginia, in 1607. Some of the first English colonists had
died of hunger and sickness. Others had not survived
the freezing cold temperatures. Some early colonists
even left their settlement and joined the Powhatan,
who could offer them a better life with more food
than in Jamestown. However, none of these things had
stopped more colonists from coming to Jamestown to
start a new life.


One of the first colonists, a man named John Smith,
had helped to save the **colony** from collapse. Another
colonist named John Rolfe had introduced a new kind of
tobacco into this area. This crop was important because
the colonists earned money selling it. Tobacco had
become popular in Europe. With John Rolfe’s help, the
colonists learned how to grow lots of tobacco. By 1618,
they were able to send more than two thousand pounds
of tobacco to England each year. Tobacco made lots of
money for the **colony** .



26

27


“Where have you been, boy?” said a tall man with
brown hair. “I’ve harvested several pounds of tobacco
leaves already.”


Tom did not reply. Instead, he grabbed a basket and
got to work. He had already figured out that the wellbeing of the colonists depended upon this plant. Much
care and attention was paid to it. When he first arrived,
Tom saw that the colonists had already planted tobacco
seeds in tiny beds. They had covered the seeds with
branches to protect them from the snow. When the seeds
became seedlings, they were then **transplanted** into the
fields. Moving the seedlings happened in April and was
the hardest job of all. Finally, the colonists had to harvest
the crop before the first frost.



28


29


Tom worked silently beside Mr. Tucker. The bottom
leaves were the first to be cut off, collected, and hung
up to dry. Tom plucked at the tobacco leaves and tried
to ignore the sweat already dripping from his brow. He
had been told that when all of the crops were harvested,
the colonists would celebrate. “That’s something to look
forward to,” Tom thought to himself. He knew, however,
that between now and then there would be many more
days of working in the hot sun.

**Chapter**

**[Jamestown and ]**
**the Powhatan**
# **4**


**Read-Aloud**

Captain John Smith was hardworking and organized.
Many historians believe that without him, Jamestown
would not have survived. When John Smith finally took
charge of the settlement, he did not “beat around the
bush.” Smith introduced a very direct rule: only those
who worked would eat.


As you can imagine, Smith was not very popular with
everyone, especially the wealthy, young adventurers who
had not been required to work.


John Smith knew it would be a huge challenge for
the settlers to survive the cold winter months. As the
weeks went by, Smith urged everyone to work on the
construction of Jamestown, to gather fruits and berries,
to fish and hunt, and to use **sparingly**, or very carefully,
the little food they had stored.



32


_John Smith talking to the colonists_

There are several different accounts of what happened
during this time. One well-known version of the story,
which you may have heard, tells how when the cold
winter months came, many of Smith’s fellow settlers were
sick and starving to death. John Smith set off to hunt, and
to **persuade** the Powhatan to give them food.


According to this account, which some might call a
legend, Smith was captured by Powhatan warriors and
taken to their chief, Wahunsenacawh (also known as
Chief Powhatan), because they wanted to kill the man
who was leading the **foreigners** . Then, as the story
goes, just moments away from Smith’s death, Chief



33


Powhatan’s young daughter Matoaka ( _mah_ -toe- _ah_ -kah)
begged her father to spare Smith. Matoaka’s nickname
was Pocahontas (which some say means playful), which is
the name she has been famously called. Chief Powhatan
agreed to his daughter’s request, and Smith was released.


However, many historians today believe that this is not
what actually happened. They think that Chief Powhatan
ordered the capture of John Smith in order to adopt him
into the Powhatan community and make him a chief to
strengthen their alliance. These historians believe that
Chief Powhatan hoped that John Smith would help him
defend the Powhatan against enemy tribes and Spanish



34


settlers. The Powhatan ritual of honoring someone with
chiefdom, involved figuratively (not really) “destroying”
their old identity, in order for them to be “reborn” and
take on their new identity as chief. So John Smith and
the settlers could have misunderstood the Powhatan’s
intentions and incorrectly believed they wanted to
harm John Smith.


When Smith returned to the Jamestown settlement,
the colonists had abandoned their work schedule.
They were **squabbling,** or arguing, among themselves
again. Snow was on the ground, and their food supply
was very low. Some were even spending their time
foolishly, searching for gold. Smith was not pleased.
He immediately set to work hunting and fishing, and
doing what he could to **persuade** his cold, hungry,
disheartened companions that all was not lost.


Then, one day, a small band of Powhatan, led by
Pocahontas, appeared out of the forest. The Powhatan
brought with them much-needed food to trade with
the colonists. Under the guidance of Chief Powhatan,
they also taught the English new hunting and farming
techniques in exchange for goods and an alliance.



35


_Pocahontas bringing food to colonists_


The food the Powhatan provided was enough to keep
the English alive until help from Britain arrived. That
help came in January 1608, when Captain Newport’s
ship, the _Susan Constant,_ arrived laden with food and
more than one hundred new settlers. The English
colonists were concerned that the Powhatan might object
to even more strangers trying to settle in their territory. So
they invited Chief Powhatan to Jamestown offering him
gifts and proposing to crown him (and have him swear
allegiance to King James I). Chief Powhatan refused to
come. John Smith said that Powhatan’s response was: “I



36


also am a king, and this is my land...” Chief Powhatan did
not want to bow to another ruler and wanted to continue
to govern his own people.


For a while, the situation for Smith and his men
improved. With more food to eat, they had energy to
work. With more men, they had more hands to help
construct the much-needed homes. Then, tragedy struck.
Somehow—and it is not certain how—a fire broke
out. The fierce flames quickly **devoured** many of the
buildings, as well as some of the food supply and clothes.
You can imagine how devastating, or upsetting, this was
for the settlers.




The English had no choice but to start again.
Fortunately, by this time, the weather was getting
warmer. The Powhatan had taught them how to grow
corn, which they called maize, now that the weather
was better. Native Americans helped them once again
by bringing more food to trade with the English. Under
John Smith’s supervision, the men set to work rebuilding
their homes, planting corn, and learning how to live in
this land that was new to them.


When spring came, Captain Newport set sail again
for England. Some historians have written that the
colonists who had been wasting their time searching for
gold **persuaded** Captain Newport to load his ship with
a large amount of red-colored dirt and bring it with
him. The gold-hungry colonists were certain that tiny
pieces of gold would be found once the dirt was properly
examined in England. However, no gold was found. It
seems that Captain Newport **transported** nothing more
than a shipload of dirt across the Atlantic Ocean!


Captain Newport returned to Jamestown again in the
fall. The English colonists were happy to see him again.
This time, Newport brought more supplies, as well as
seventy men, and two women. One woman, Margaret
Foxe Forrest, was the wife of one of the men on board,



38


and the other was her maid, Ann Burras. They were the
first female settlers to live in Jamestown! Some of the
other new settlers were from Poland and Germany, and
they brought the skill of glassmaking to the **colony** .


By this time, John Smith had been elected president of
the **colony**, and he had consistently enforced his rule: all
must work if they wanted to eat. In fact, these are Captain
John Smith’s exact words: “He that gathereth not every day
as much as I do, the next day shall be set beyond the river
and be banished from the fort as a drone till he **amend** his
conditions or starve.”



39


Under John’s Smith’s leadership, the colony began
to prosper. Chief Powhatan and John Smith established
better relations between the Powhatan people and
the settlers. The two communities began to trade
with each other. Powhatan people provided food and
taught important skills to settlers in exchange for
beads and copper.


However, two years after Jamestown was established,
John Smith was injured in a gunpowder explosion.
Without medical assistance, his wounds would not heal.
Smith was forced to return to England.


The man chosen to lead the **colony** in Smith’s
absence was George Percy. Unfortunately, Percy was not
as good a leader as Smith had been. After Smith left,
the Powhatan’s mistrust grew of the increasing crowd of
settlers encroaching upon their land and food supply.


Without John Smith there to actively promote
friendship and trade between the Powhatan and
the colonists, relations began to suffer. In addition,
Wahunsenacawh Chief Powhatan had passed away, and
his successor, his brother, did not agree with the alliance
he made with the settlers. The Powhatan no longer had
someone they felt they could trust within the **colony** .
Without John Smith there to enforce his rules, the



40


settlers did not manage their food supplies as carefully as
they should have. The settlers and the Powhatan battled,
and then, once again, part of the settlement caught fire.


After the battle and the fire, the Powhatan blocked
trade with the settlers. They could not find enough food
to support the community. The settlers waited **anxiously**
for a ship that was due to arrive with supplies. But no
ship appeared on the horizon. The winter of 1609 to
1610 became known as the “ **starving time** ” because the
colonists ran out of food and many of them died.


_Great distress in Jamestown_



41


Finally, one spring day, two ships were spotted. They
were the _Patience_ and the _Deliverance._ The settlers who
had survived ran to the banks of the James River in eager
anticipation. Both ships had been badly damaged at sea
and had just barely made it to Virginia. The ships were
low on supplies. The settlers begged to be taken back to
England, and the two captains agreed.


Perhaps the most incredible part of this story is what
happened next. Just as the surviving settlers had turned
their backs on Jamestown and set sail for England, they
spotted an advance party of Englishmen sailing toward
them. The retreating settlers were immediately informed
that Lord De la Warr was close behind. Lord De la Warr
was appointed by King James to serve as governor, or
leader, of Jamestown. Lord De la Warr, it seems, had
saved the day—well, the entire settlement, actually. He
had led three ships across the Atlantic filled to the brim
with Englishmen and supplies destined for Jamestown.


The Powhatan were probably angered and frustrated
to see the settlers return. Even worse, there were more of
them! Lord De la Warr turned out to be a better leader
for the settlers than their previous one. He restored
a sense of order in Jamestown. Under his leadership,
the buildings were repaired, and the food and supplies
were efficiently managed. However, Lord De la Warr
did not reach out to the Powhatan as John Smith had.



42


Things in England were changing, and the instructions
to Jamestown from the Virginia Company of London
were to stop trading with and relying upon the nearby
Native Americans.


Over the next several years, more and more skilled
settlers made their way to Virginia. Eventually, in 1619,
the first shipload of women arrived. Colonists began to
raise families in this English **colony** .


Although gold was not discovered, something just as
valuable was. In time, a settler named John Rolfe began
to establish a relationship with the Powhatan once again.
Guided by the Powhatan, and under the supervision of
John Rolfe, the settlers began to grow tobacco.



43


_House of Burgesses Assembly_

There were other important developments that took place
in 1619. Now that things were going better in the English
colonies, the English government felt comfortable allowing the
colonists to make certain rules of their own. That was, as long
as the colonists remembered who was really in charge. On July
30, 1619, the first lawmaking assembly gathered in the Virginia
House of Burgesses. Members of the House of Burgesses were
chosen to represent areas of the **colony** of Virginia. In those
days, only men could be chosen, but the House of Burgesses
would eventually pave the way for self-government and,
**ultimately**, **independence** .


Conflict continued between the Powhatan and the colonists
because each group believed they were the most dominant
power in the region. During another period of conflict, each
group tried to take things of high value from the other. The
Powhatan kidnapped some of the settlers and took several
firearms, or guns, and the settlers kidnapped Pocahontas.



44


Pocahontas’ father was willing to return the kidnapped
settlers in exchange for his daughter, but he refused to return
such valuable supplies. In response, the settlers refused to let
Pocahontas go. **Consequently**, or as a result, Pocahontas was
held captive in the English settlement for many years.


During this time, Pocahontas and John Rolfe were
married and later had a child named Thomas. During this
time, Pocahontas was converted to Christianity and took the
name Rebecca, an English name. It was not uncommon for
Native Americans to be expected to change their name and
customs when engaging with European colonists. She and
John Rolfe traveled together to England, where they were
guests at the court of King James. Sadly, just as Pocahontas
and John Rolfe were preparing to return to Virginia, she
became very ill. Pocahontas died on March 21, 1617, at the
age of 22, and was buried in England.


Later, in the last years of
his life, John Smith spoke
of Pocahontas and said
that without her help and
the help of the Powhatan,
Jamestown would never
have survived.

**Chapter**

**Jamestown, Part**
**II: Hunting the**
**Powhatan Way**



Do you remember in Chapter 3
you met Tom and his sister Jane?
Today, you will find out more about
Tom and his life in Jamestown.





Tom was glad it was Sunday. This
was the only day of the week that many people didn’t
work in the fields or in their workshops. This made Tom
very happy. On Sunday, Tom was also allowed to hunt
or fish. Before chapel, Tom and his friend William often
set off to catch a rabbit or a fish for the pot. Today was
no exception, and William had arrived at Tom’s house
bright and early.


Tom and William had been hunting and fishing
together ever since Tom first arrived in Jamestown.
William had taught Tom how to use a bow and arrow
and how to catch fish.



46


47


Although Tom had been a city boy, he had taken to
hunting and fishing right away, or, as Mrs. Tucker had
said, “like a duck to water.”


William had learned to hunt, fish, and find food
from a group of Powhatan boys. They had been
welcoming and friendly to him. They taught him that
everything they needed they could get from the land
around them. They were expert hunters and could catch
more fish than William could catch in a week! They
knew what berries and nuts were safe to eat. They also
had yummy food made from corn and beans and squash
that had been grown by their mothers. William told Tom
that without their help, the settlers would never have
survived in the colony.



48


_William had learned to hunt and fish from a group of Powhatan_
_boys._



49


As time went on, however, the Powhatan boys
didn’t visit Jamestown too much anymore. Tension
began to grow between the Powhatan and Jamestown
colonists. The two groups became engaged in conflict.
The Powhatan wanted the colonists to leave their land.
However, the colonists weren’t going away. Quite the
opposite was happening. More and more colonists
were arriving.



50


_The Powhatan didn’t visit Jamestown too much anymore as the_
_conflict began to grow between them and the Jamestown colonists._



51


On this particular day, the boys were going hunting.


“Come on, Tom. Let’s go and catch our dinner,” he
yelled as he stood in the Tuckers’ open doorway.


“Don’t be out there all day,” exclaimed Mrs. Tucker.


“We won’t be,” Tom replied. With that, the two boys
ran off toward the woodland some distance away.


The boys loved to be in the forest. At this time of the
year, the sights, smells, and sounds were almost magical.
As they crept forward, they **trod** upon a carpet of pine
needles. The sunlight broke through the tall treetops and
shafts of light **illuminated** their path. All around them
they could hear the **scurrying** of forest creatures. They
walked for a while, enjoying the gift of freedom. They
crossed a stream and bent down to drink the water from
their cupped hands. As they did, they both heard the
sudden, sharp sound of a branch breaking.



52


_William and Tom loved to be in the forest._



53


The branch fell to the ground a few feet away from
them. Both boys looked up instantly. High up in a tree,
about twenty feet above the ground, was a Powhatan
boy, named Ahanu, about the same age as William and
Tom. He was sitting on a wide branch and staring at
them. His bow and arrow were pointed directly at Tom.
Ahanu had heard someone coming. Not knowing who it
was, he raised his bow and arrow, because he felt scared
and nervous about what could happen to him.


William began to speak in a language that Tom did
not recognize. Ahanu replied using words that Tom did
not understand. Then, Ahanu, recognizing his old friend
and deciding to trust him, smiled and climbed down the
tree, landing right beside the boys.

_Ahanu felt scared and nervous upon hearing someone in_

Seconds later, Ahanu motioned for them to follow
him. William pushed Tom forward.


“What are we doing?” whispered Tom.


“We’re hunting,” William replied.


“Are we hunting with him?” Tom asked.


“Yes,” William said. “He’s a friend of mine. He’s
going to teach us how to hunt for deer.”


“I thought we were hunting for rabbits,” said
Tom nervously.


“Well, now we are hunting for deer,” said William,
smiling at this friend. “Come on, you’ve survived the
streets of London haven’t you?”


With that, William and Tom followed Ahanu deeper
into the forest.

As you heard, John Rolfe is well-known for marrying
Chief Powhatan’s daughter, Pocahontas—whose real
name was Matoaka [ _mah_ -toe- _ah_ -kah]—and for making
Jamestown (and therefore Virginia) an important
economic center. John Rolfe did this by growing and
exporting tobacco, and then shipping it out of the area
to places that wanted to buy it. Because of this, tobacco
became a huge part of the Southern colonies' economy.

The Spanish merchants were the first to bring tobacco
to Europe from the Americas. They had discovered
that Native Americans in various parts of Central and
South America used tobacco in a variety of ways; it was
used as medicine and considered an important part of
many ceremonies. In fact, when Christopher Columbus
first set foot in what he called the “New World” he was
greeted by local Natives carrying gifts of fruit, spears,
and dried leaves that had a strong fragrance. Those leaves
were tobacco.


When the English arrived in North America, they, too,
found that many Native Americans grew tobacco. The
English settlers’ plan had not succeeded when they failed
to find gold. Some settlers had also experimented with
growing crops such as rice and grapes, but they, too, were
unsuccessful. However, John Rolfe, with the guidance
of the Powhatan, made a **pivotal** contribution to the
doomed Jamestown economy.



59


_Busy port scene with trade ships and tobacco_


Tobacco was beginning to become popular among
wealthy Europeans. However, much of the tobacco being
shipped to Europe was too bitter. John Rolfe introduced
a new tobacco plant to the fields around Jamestown. He
brought in a different plant from the West Indies. Well,
actually, he brought in the seeds to see if they would grow.
It was an experiment, but it worked. The new tobacco
plants grew and **flourished** in the red Virginia soil. And
so, the milder Virginia tobacco became much sought
after. The increased demand **transformed** the **colony's**
economy. Jamestown became a place of wealth and
enterprise. Shiploads of Englishmen and women eagerly
set off to make their fortune there.



60


The gold that the early settlers had sought turned
out to be in the form of an odorous plant. Many people
became wealthy as a result of growing this cash crop. No
doubt, if you had been there in Jamestown, you might
have heard the sound of gold coins jingling in the colonists’
pockets. Tobacco was so popular that by the early 1600s,
it had become Virginia’s main crop. Within fifty years,
the **colony** exported about fifteen million pounds of it
to Europe. Eventually, tobacco was such a widespread
cash crop that the governor had to remind the settlers to
grow food crops as well! With the success of the tobacco
industry, the future of Jamestown was finally secured.


However, there was one major drawback to growing
tobacco. During this time, a lot of people were needed
who could work very, very hard to **tend** the large
**plantations** . People were needed who could work with
their hands, in harsh conditions, day and night, in all


_Indentured servants_
_working on tobacco_
_**plantation**_



61


kinds of weather, for little pay. And finding people
willing to do that wasn't easy.


In the beginning, the new tobacco farmers had
mostly **indentured servants** working for them.
Indentured servants were people who had agreed to
travel to Virginia (and eventually to other parts of North
America) to work for a period of time for a specific
person. The agreed-upon period of time was usually
seven years. Often these indentured servants were poor
people from England or other parts of Europe whose
ship passage was purchased for them by their employer.
Then, as soon as they arrived at their new homes, the
indentured servants were put to work. These indentured
servants labored long and hard in the tobacco fields.
After the agreed-upon time of service was up, they were
free to venture out on their own.


However, as the **colony** developed, there became
a serious shortage of workers. Some began to think
indentured servants would not be enough, and they
started looking for ways to force people to work without
having any freedom. At this point in history, the practice
of **slavery** had been common in the world for several
thousand years. A hundred years before Jamestown was
settled, in the Spanish colonies of the Caribbean and the
Portuguese colonies of South America, ships had begun



62


bringing enslaved Africans to work on **plantations** to
the Americas. The practice unfortunately spread to the
English colonies. English colonists, like the Spanish and
Portuguese before them, began to believed that the use
of African slaves was the most efficient way to manage
plantations. Before long, thousands of Africans were
captured, brought to the colonies, and forced to work on
plantations. Why did this transition take place?


Remember, various European countries were laying
claim to different regions in the Americas. The Spaniards
were claiming land in most of Central and South
America and parts of southern North America. French
settlers had claimed land in much of northern North
America. Having started to lay claim to large areas of
North America, the British empire sought to claim huge
chunks of land as well. As you recall, England’s very first
attempt to colonize North America on Roanoke Island,


_Charles II showing_
_land to his friends_



63


became known as the Lost **Colony** .


But in 1663, Charles II, the son of Charles I and
grandson of King James I, decided to try again near the
same area. Charles II eagerly gave a charter, or official
document, to eight of his friends that stated that the
land between Virginia and the Spanish **colony** of Florida
now belonged to him—well, to England, to be precise.
Today, this land is North Carolina, South Carolina, and
Georgia—although Georgia was not officially colonized
until much later. Charles II also named part of this land
after himself. This charter was extended in 1665, and
more land was divided up among his friends to manage.


Charles II was particularly generous to those who
had helped his family when his father, Charles I, was
killed. At that time, Charles II had been forced to flee to
another country. When
Charles II was eventually
allowed to return to
England and take the
throne, he owed a great
deal of money to a great
many people. His way
out of **debt** was to “give”
them North America—



64


well, parts of it, anyway.


Having heard how successful Jamestown was,
hundreds and then thousands of English flocked to the
South, and to the Carolinas in particular. In 1670, a
busy seaport was established called Charles Town. I’m
sure you can guess who Charles Town was named after.


In the beginning, many colonists in the Carolinas
established small farms. Before long, large **plantations**
replaced small farms for the purpose of growing cash
crops. The top three cash crops in this area during this
time were rice, tobacco, and **indigo** . **Indigo** is a tropical
plant that is a member of the pea family that is grown to
create blue dye.


The warm climate and marshy stretches of land with
fewer trees in the Carolinas were perfect for growing
rice and indigo, whereas tobacco thrived in certain parts
of North Carolina. With drier land and more trees, the
geography and climate of Virginia was not conducive to
growing rice and indigo; tobacco was the only cash crop
in Jamestown.


As in Virginia, it soon became clear that there was
a lot of money to be made in the Carolinas by growing
crops. Many more workers were needed. The solution



65


the colonists chose to fix this problem was slavery. Unlike
indentured servants, enslaved Africans did not come
to North America of their own free will as part of an
exchange agreement.


Throughout history, many civilizations have enslaved
people. Although England began trading enslaved
Africans later than some other European countries, it
soon became heavily involved in the trading of enslaved
people due to the widespread use of slavery in the
English colonies.


For England, Spain, and Portugal, the trading of


_Triangular Trade_



66


_English ship arriving in West African port_


enslaved Africans was part of a larger trade network among
Europe, West Africa, and the Americas (including English
colonies in North America, Spanish colonies in the West
Indies, and Portuguese colonies in South America).
Some of these trade routes became known as “triangular
trade routes.” If you look at the map, you will see why.
Through these triangular trade networks, certain goods
were traded for other much-needed items and slaves.


The first side of the triangle was from Europe to
Africa. Portuguese, Spanish and English ships laden with
manufactured iron products arrived in the West African
ports to trade their goods for enslaved people and gold.



67


Europeans set up slave trading centers at these ports.
They would purchase people who had been kidnapped
who previously lived freely in Africa. The Europeans
would use their manufactured iron products as payment.


Enslaved Africans were loaded onto ships destined
for colonies in South America, the Caribbean, and North
America. This second side of the triangle, the trade route
from West Africa to the Americas, became known as the
Middle Passage.


In the Americas, the slaves were then traded for goods
that would go back to Europe – sugar, tobacco, and other
cash crops grown by plantations run by the Portuguese,
Spanish, or English colonists. This was the third side
of the triangular slave trade. Back in Europe, these cash
crops could be traded for European manufactured iron
products, and the trade would continue.


Most enslaved Africans ended up in the Spanish
or Portuguese colonies in the Caribbean and in South
America. In the English colonies in North America, most
enslaved Africans were sent to the colonies in the South.
While there were also some slaves in the North, most
farms in the Middle Atlantic and New England regions
were smaller and more easily maintained by families
without the need for additional labor. But the large



68


plantations in the English colonies in the South were
similar to the large plantations of the Caribbean and
South America, and used large amounts of slave labor.
But even as the use of slave labor grew, opposition to
slavery also grew, driven by colonists morally opposed to
the practice, often based on their beliefs as Christians.

**Chapter**

**Plantations**
### **7**

Seth was 9 years old. He had been
working all day. Besides doing some
chores for his mom, he had to work
clearing brush around the swampy
rice fields.

“I’m tired,” he said quietly to himself.

He found a wagon near the barn and laid down under
a giant piece of sack cloth to rest. The wagon was used
to **transport** sacks of rice to town. Seth fell asleep lying
underneath the sack cloth before he finished all his work.

Seth was enslaved and lived on a large plantation in
South Carolina in the year 1715. The main crop grown
on this **plantation** was rice. Rice is a type of grass. It is a
very important food crop.



70


Life on the **plantation** was hard. Those who were
enslaved were forced to work long hours without
pay. They had to obey the **plantation** owner, and
had no freedom.


Seth had fallen asleep thinking about his two older
brothers. They did not work on the same rice plantation
as Seth anymore. Both of them were forced to work for
a neighbor who had a tobacco **plantation** . George, the
older of the two brothers, had been allowed to visit when
their mother became sick with swamp fever. Because
they were sent to work on a different **plantation**, it was
difficult to visit. Seth and his parents had been so happy
to see George. Even though she was sick, their mother
had made cornbread to celebrate.


During that visit, George told Seth about the
differences between the tobacco and rice plantations.



71


_George told Seth about being forced to work on a tobacco_
_**plantation**_ _._



72


“On a tobacco **plantation**, slaves work from sunup
to sundown,” George had said. “You have no time off.
You have to **tend** to those tobacco leaves all the time.
When one task is done, another one comes along before
you know it.”


Seth didn’t like the sound of that one bit and he
hoped he didn’t end up growing tobacco. On a rice
**plantation**, enslaved people had certain tasks to do.
When they were finished, they could do the chores that
they needed to do for themselves. Although enslaved
people on a rice **plantation** spent less time in the fields,
it wasn’t true that life on a rice **plantation** was easier
than life on a tobacco **plantation** . Growing rice was a
dangerous business.


Rice grows in water. People who were enslaved had
to spend hours in swamp-like fields **tending** to the rice
crops. The rice crops and the enslaved people weren’t the
only ones in the water. There were snakes and alligators.
That’s how Seth’s mother had become sick with
swamp fever.



73


74


The sound of a dog barking woke Seth. He had been
asleep in the wagon for several hours. When he peeked
out from under the sack cloth, he saw that the stars
were twinkling in the night sky. He could smell wood
burning in the cook’s kitchen. He could hear the sound
of bullfrogs calling to each other in the night air.


“Boy am I in trouble!” said Seth out loud as he
jumped down from the wagon. He crept through the
darkness toward the small, wooden house that he lived in
with his mother and father and other people who were
enslaved. He would get a talking to from his parents for
getting home late.



75


_Seth awoke to see stars in the sky._



76


Seth peeked through the cracks in the walls of his
house, the same cracks that let in cold air during the
winter. A candle burned on a **rickety** table and in the
candlelight, he could see his mother sewing his torn pants.
“Maybe she’ll be too tired to be angry,” Seth thought to
himself as he pushed open the door and then closed it
behind him.





77


_Seth hoped his mother would not be angry._

**The Founding**
**of Maryland and**
**Georgia**



**Read-Aloud**

With so much trade going on, and the abundance
of ships laden with valuable cargo, it’s **inevitable**, or
unavoidable, that pirates would make an appearance in
this story. The English colonies, particularly those in
the Southern region and the West Indies, became well
known as places where pirates hid from the law. These
pirates were known as buccaneers.


Buccaneers were a group of men from England,
France, and Holland. They terrorized sailors and
captured trade ships in this region. Because of the
success of these infamous pirates, some countries were
forced to send naval ships to accompany their trade
ships safely back across the Atlantic to ports in Europe.
The Americas were turning out to be a place where
many different groups of Europeans, including these
different gangs of pirates, felt they had the opportunity
to become rich.



80


_Pirates taking over a trading ship_


Back on land, the English colonies were expanding.
Today you will learn about two more colonies—Maryland
and Georgia. Both of these colonies have an interesting
history. However, the development of Maryland and
Georgia was a little different from that of Virginia. Let’s
begin with Maryland.


You learned about the large **plantations** that were
prevalent in the South. Maryland was considered a
Southern **colony**, though it was geographically in the
Middle Atlantic region. Although there were many small
farms in Maryland, there were a fair number of large
**plantations** in the southern portion. Like Virginia,
Maryland’s economy was based on tobacco agriculture as
a cash crop.



81


Before he was killed, Charles I had given a large
section of land north of Virginia to a friend. This time,
the lucky recipient of land was Sir George Calvert.


Sir Calvert, who was also known as Lord Baltimore,
received this generous gift in 1632. Sir Calvert was
a Roman Catholic. In England at that time, Roman
Catholics were not very well-liked because they were not
part of the official Church of England. The Church of
England—the Anglican Church—had split apart from
the Roman Catholic Church. Many people in England at
that time believed that Roman Catholics would be more
loyal to the Catholic pope than to the king—and they
did not like that. However, because King Charles’s wife,
Queen Henrietta Maria, was Catholic, Charles tried to be
respectful of Catholics for her sake. Delighted by Charles’s
gift, Sir Calvert named his **colony** “Maryland” in honor
of Queen Maria.



82


Maryland was different from Virginia because it
was controlled by Sir Calvert’s family. Sir Calvert’s son
Cecil determined that Maryland would be a safe haven
for Catholics. In the beginning, it was. In fact, in 1634,
Cecil’s brother, Leonard Calvert, led the first group of
Catholics to this **colony** . Leonard Calvert later became
the first governor of Maryland.


The colonists and the Native Americans in Maryland
established peaceful relations. In addition, the colonists
They did not waste time searching for gold, but instead
immediately established farms and trading posts. They
soon settled into organized communities with laws that
were clearly defined.


It wasn’t long before word got out that Maryland
was quite a nice place to live. Europeans searching for
a better life free of poverty and religious persecution
journeyed to this **colony** . And it wasn’t just Roman
Catholics who came. Other Christians who belonged
to different churches came to settle in Maryland, too.
Before long, Maryland became known as a place that
practiced religious freedom—so much so that, in 1649,
Lord Baltimore had the Maryland General Assembly pass
the Act of Toleration. This law stated that all Christians
in Maryland would be tolerated, or allowed the freedom
to worship. This law **confirmed** that Christians from



83


_Maryland General Assembly passing Act of Toleration_

different churches—Protestants, Catholics, and others—
could practice their religion without **interference** .


The last Southern **colony** to be founded was Georgia.
One day, a member of Parliament in London, England,
named James Oglethorpe had a brainstorm. Oglethorpe
had noticed that English jails were overflowing with
**debtors** . In England during this time, people were put
in jail, called a **debtor’s** prison, if they were unable to
pay their **debts** . Sometimes these jailed **debtors** owed a
little amount of money, and sometimes they owed a lot.
Oglethorpe had noticed that these **debtors** —even those
who owed a relatively small amount of money—were
often left in jail, without any way of paying back the
money they owed.



84


_Debtors on their land in Georgia._

Oglethorpe’s unique idea was to set up a new **colony**
in North America where these **debtors** would be given a
second chance. They would be given land so they could
begin a new life. They could work to pay back the money
they owed, and then their **debt** would be forgiven.


In 1732, the then-king, George II, liked this idea.
He gave Oglethorpe a charter saying that he could take
a band of **debtors** from England to the area of land
between South Carolina and Spanish Florida. The British
Parliament supported this venture by giving Oglethorpe
money and ships to make the journey. Upon reaching this
land, Oglethorpe named it Georgia after his royal majesty.
(Kings just expected lands that were new to Europeans to
be named after them.) Georgia was even larger back then



85


_Oglethorpe receiving_
_charter from King_
_George II_


than the state of Georgia is today. It included much of
present-day Alabama and Mississippi.


However, even though sending **debtors** to the
colonies seemed like a brilliant plan to Oglethorpe and
the king, it was difficult to **persuade** many **debtors** to
leave their families and homes, and sail three thousand
miles across the Atlantic Ocean to a place where they
might not be welcomed with open arms. Once they
arrived, the **debtors** would have to build their own
homes, as well as gather, hunt, and grow their own food.
Many **debtors** preferred to serve their time in jail in
England rather than face the unknown in the Americas.
In all, about one hundred **debtors** agreed to go on the
journey to North America. They began the laborious task
of helping to turn Georgia into a **colony** .


As soon as he arrived in Georgia, the leader of the
Yamacraw, a group of Native Americans in the region,



86


met with Oglethorpe. Chief Tomochichi [toh-moh
chee-chee] and the Yamacraw established trade with
the British and gave them permission to settle there.
Chief Tomochichi and Oglethorpe worked hard to
establish alliances between their people. In appreciation,
Oglethorpe invited some of the Yamacraw to visit
England. Oglethorpe and his band of debtors developed
the first European settlement in Georgia: Savannah.


Of course, King George had another motive for
sending settlers to Georgia besides helping **debtors**
start a new life. As you can see on the map, Georgia is
located between the Carolinas and what was then known
as Spanish Florida. At this point, the British had not
established any official colonies to the south of South


_Oglethorpe meeting with Chief Tomochichi_



87


Carolina, so this was the perfect way to protect the
colonies from the Spanish empire. Georgia served as a
buffer zone to separate English colonies from the Spanish
colonies. This would also allow colonists to keep an
eye on the Spanish monarchy’s ambitions for growth in
North America.


But King George did not realize that the Spaniards
had already claimed the very area he had in mind.
It wasn’t long before there was armed confrontation
between the Spaniards and the British. As time went
by, more and more settlers arrived in Georgia. Some of
them did not get along with the Native people as well
as Oglethorpe and his followers had. The Spaniards



88


continued to stake their claim to the land, and buccaneers
often attacked vital trade ships. This new **colony**, the last
one to be created, suffered its fair share of problems in
its early days.


Whereas few English **debtors** would agree to come
and settle in Georgia, many poor Europeans from other
countries began to arrive and establish farms in this
**colony** . They came primarily from Ireland and Germany.
Georgian farmers liked the idea of **plantation** farming,
as it had proven successful in other Southern colonies.
However, the colonists soon found farming to be a
backbreaking job and insisted that they needed help.
Under the leadership of James Oglethorpe, Georgia
banned slavery in 1735. However, it was legalized by
royal decree in 1751, at the urging of English investors
in the colony. After that, colonists in Georgia began to
rely more and more on the labor of enslaved people from
Africa, especially to farm their rice plantations.


Before long, Georgia became a **colony** identified with
**plantation** life and the heavy use of enslaved laborers.
Within one hundred years of being established, the state
of Georgia had more **plantations** than any other state
in the South.

# **9**

Hello, my name is Sarah. My family
and I are from England. We have been in
Savannah, Georgia, for five years now. We
left England in November, 1737, onboard
a sailing ship called the _Anne_ . It took us
two months to get to these shores. I will never forget
how **bitterly** cold it was on the deck of the ship. The
wind felt worse than a stinging insect when it touched
my face. The waves were dark, gray, and frightening.
They tossed our ship about, here, there, and everywhere.
I feared that those giant waves would **devour** us.


Our first stop in North America was Charleston.
After that, we made our way to the town I now live in
called Savannah. Savannah is in the English **colony**
of Georgia. It’s not quite a town yet, like the ones
in England, but it will be. When we first arrived in
Savannah, my mother called it a wilderness. I was six
years old then. Now, I am eleven.



90


91


Mr. James Oglethorpe and twenty-one other English
gentlemen had been granted a charter by King George II
of England. The charter gave them permission to create
an English **colony** under English law. The charter states
that they are the trustees, or governors, of this **colony**,
meaning they are in charge. However, everyone knows
that it is really Mr. Oglethorpe who is in charge because
he makes all of the decisions. I have also heard that Mr.
Oglethorpe wants this **colony** to succeed so much that
he sold some of his own property in England to earn
money for Georgia.


Mr. Oglethorpe is a personal friend of the king and
he **persuaded** his majesty to create this **colony** . My
father said that Mr. Oglethorpe **intends** to bring **debtors**
here, too. When I asked him what **debtors** were, he told
me that they are people who owe money to other people.
Often they go to jail until they can pay off their **debts** .
They can even die in jail. Mr. Oglethorpe wants some of

in Georgia.

92


My parents aren’t **debtors** . They were chosen by
Mr. Oglethorpe for their skills. My father is a carpenter
and my mother is a seamstress. Mr. Oglethorpe wanted
mostly skilled people to come to Savannah. He said
that would be the only way we would survive here. I
have heard the grownups talk about what happened to
the first settlers in Virginia. Some of them died because
they were not skilled enough to make their way. Many
others died because of cold and hunger though. So Mr.
Oglethorpe and the other trustees chose mostly farmers,
merchants, bakers, carpenters, and blacksmiths to be the
first English colonists here.


_A baker, a carpenter,_
_a farmer, and a_
_blacksmith_



93


When we first arrived in Savannah, we lived in tents.
Altogether, there were forty families. We worked very
hard to build the wall that now surrounds us. Inside the
wall, we built our homes. Everyone worked, even the
children. Slowly, our town began to take shape. There is
still a lot of work to be done, though. It does not yet look
like the busy city of London that we left behind.


While some people are unhappy about how strict
Mr. Oglethorpe is being in the colony, my parents say
that Mr. Oglethorpe is a wise man. When we first arrived,
the chief of a local **tribe** called the Yamacraw offered to
make peace with him in exchange for trade. The chief’s
name is Tomochichi. Tomochichi even traveled back to
England with Mr. Oglethorpe when he went to get more
supplies for us.



94


95


Tomochichi and his people trust us—at least for
now. In fact, I have heard some of the boys saying that
the Spaniards to the south of us are our main enemy.
They want this land. The Spanish colonists have a
large fort called St. Augustine in Spanish Florida. They
could attack us at any time. Because of this **threat**, Mr.
Oglethorpe has once again returned to England to ask
King George II for soldiers to help protect us. My father
says that it is only a matter of time before we will have to
fight the Spaniards for this land. These words scare me.


I must go now. I hear my mother calling me. I have
to help her prepare the evening meal. I hope we get a
chance to talk again.

Mary and Remember Allerton
ran as fast as they could toward
their house. Their stepmother, Fear

father had pointed out many times, it was not a good
idea to keep a woman whose name was Fear waiting.


In the late afternoon, the children had gone out to
collect firewood. After gathering the wood, they had
stopped to play in the forest with their friends, Love and
Wrestling Brewster. Love and Wrestling Brewster were
Pilgrim brothers. They had also gone into the forest to
collect firewood. Like many of the Pilgrim children,
these children had been given special names at birth.
Their names often **indicated** what kind of person their
parents hoped they would become. Sometimes their
names **revealed** something that had happened at the time
of their birth.



98


_Mary and Remember hurried home._



99


Remember had been given her name because her
mother had said that she would always remember, and
never forget, her birth. Wrestling wasn’t happy with his
name. He didn’t feel much like a wrestler. Wrestling
planned to change his name when he was older. He was
going to change it to John. He had been a weak baby and
his father had given him the name hoping that it would
make him strong.



100


101


When the children had gathered as much firewood
as they could carry, they dropped it into a large pile and
played a game of hide and seek. Then, they climbed trees
and collected sweet berries to eat. They pretended to be
English pirates capturing Spanish galleons laden with
gold. It wasn’t until the sun had begun to set that they
realized they had been gone for quite some time. The
children **anxiously** gathered up their firewood and made
their way home.



102


_Pilgrim children pretended to be English pirates._



103


Four years earlier, all four of these children had
survived the journey onboard the _Mayflower_ from
England. They had arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts,
in 1621. Their parents were English Separatists. English
Separatists were people who were unhappy with the
Church of England and wanted to separate from it
and start their own church. They wanted to be free to
**worship** God in their own way.


The king of England, James I, was the head of the
Church of England. He harassed anyone who did not
obey the rules of the church. As a result, many English
Separatists left England. The children’s families had
first tried living in the Netherlands, but they were not
happy there. Finally, they and others set out across the
Atlantic Ocean to establish their own **colony** in North
America. Because they were willing to travel to a faraway
place for their religious beliefs, they began calling
themselves Pilgrims.



104

105


The journey across the ocean, and the first winter
in the **colony**, was now just a terrible memory. So
many people had died either on the ship or within
the first months of being in Plymouth. They had died
from disease, hunger, and the extremely cold weather.
Mary, Remember, Love, and Wrestling had **witnessed**
many Pilgrims suffer. Worst of all was the death of
the children's beloved mother. Their father had tried
to comfort them as best he could. The girls had felt
that their hearts had been broken. Their brother
Bartholomew had hidden in the forest for several days.
He had refused to come back no matter how often they
called his name. He finally came back though. When
spring arrived, Bartholomew had helped their father
build a house and plant crops.

The Pilgrims had not **intended** to settle in
Plymouth. They had been planning to go to Virginia,
but their ship had been blown off course. It had taken
them two months to cross the ocean. Mary, Remember,
Wrestling, and Love had wondered if they would ever see
dry land again.


When they finally arrived, it was wintertime and
they were in an unknown land hundreds of miles north
of their **intended** destination. This place was much
colder than Virginia. Even more **alarming** was that
many of the Pilgrims had noticed that the soil was not
very good for farming. If they could not farm, they
would have no chance of surviving in this new territory.
The children’s new home was not at all what they had
imagined it to be.

**The Pilgrims, Part**
**II: Thanksgiving**
**Celebration**



Do you remember that in
the previous chapter, you met
the Pilgrim children Mary and
Remember Allerton and Love and

story, they were collecting firewood and playing in the
forest. Then, you traveled back in time and learned how
they had arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts. In this
chapter, we will continue to find out more about their
early experiences in Plymouth.


Years earlier, when the Pilgrims and their children
arrived in Plymouth in 1621, they had built shelters by
day and returned to their ship by night to sleep.



110


_Mary and her family remain in Plymouth._



111


In the winter, the Pilgrims shivered in the cold
as they buried those that had not survived. Mary,
Remember, Love, and Wrestling had wondered if they
would survive.


While the settlers endured many hardships, the
Native Americans in this region faced them as well. One
tribe, the Patuxet, who had lived in the area, had created
fields for planting. Sadly, many members of this tribe
had already died from contagious diseases. Because of
this, their fields were not in use. This meant that the
hungry and weary English colonists did not have to
clear the forests before planting. In addition, there was
another key factor to the Pilgrims’ survival: the help of
the Wampanoag, the Native Americans living in the area.


Having experienced the loss of his own people, a
Native American called Squanto came to the aid of the
Pilgrims. Squanto’s friend Samoset agreed to help too.
Both of these Native Americans spoke English. Squanto
spoke English well. In 1605, he had been taken to
England by an English explorer.



112


_Squanto and Samoset helped the Pilgrims._



113


Squanto and Samoset showed the Pilgrims how to
plant corn, squash, and beans and how to make these
crops grow in the poor soil. Squanto also taught people
to recognize berries and fruits that could be eaten and
where the best places to fish were. Wrestling Brewster
often talked of how he had feared these people at
first. But when they helped the settlers, Wrestling had
changed his mind. Love and Wrestling had gone fishing
with Squanto. Squanto gave the Pilgrims hope.


The colonists had also made peace with a local
**tribe** called the Wampanoag. Both sides agreed to help
and protect each other. They agreed to trade with each
other, too.



114


_Squanto and Samoset showed the Pilgrims how to make crops_
_grow in poor soil._



115


Slowly, the days grew warmer and the Pilgrims
became happier. They were no longer cold and hungry.
The first fall was one of the most precious memories
Mary, Remember, Love, and Wrestling had. The crops
had grown well and their harvest was abundant. Besides
farming, the colonists had also learned how to hunt and
fish to survive. As a result, they had produced more than
enough food to get them through the next winter. They
had also been able to build homes that would protect
them from the cold weather when it came again. While
they mourned the loss of so many, the surviving colonists
were thankful for what they now had. That is why they
decided to give thanks to God for the Native people who
had helped them.



116


_An abundant harvest_



117


A great celebration of thanksgiving was organized.
The local Wampanoag were invited to the thanksgiving
celebration. Squanto and Samoset were invited, too.
The Wampanoag chief, Massasoit (MAS-ə-soyt), was the
guest of honor.


Everyone there had dined on deer, duck, lobster,
fish, cornbread, pumpkin, squash, and berries. They
had eaten until they were fuller than they had ever been
before. They had played games and they had run races.
The Wampanoag had stayed in the **colony** for several
days. It was probably the happiest time the children
could ever remember. They often spoke of it. Since then,
more and more Pilgrims had arrived. More homes had
been built. Their father had married Fear Allerton.


All these early experiences of the children happened
four years ago. Now, here the children were, playing in a
forest in the colony.



118


_A celebration of thanksgiving_



119


As Mary and Remember hurried out of the forest,
they said their goodbyes to Love and Wrestling. Minutes
later they arrived at the door to their house. Their arrival
had not gone unnoticed. The door to their house was
flung open and Fear appeared in the doorway. She stood
there with her hands on her hips.


“It’s a good thing I had already collected firewood
earlier in the day or the fire would have gone out long
ago,” she exclaimed. “Anyone would think you had to
grow the tree before cutting it down. Now, go wash your
hands and help me set the table.”


Mary and Remember looked at each other as they
inched past their stepmother. They both knew she was
not done scolding them.

**Read-Aloud**

In the last lesson, you read about the Pilgrims’
arrival at Plymouth Rock, their struggle to survive
their first year in America, and the help they received
from the Native people. Squanto, his friend Samoset,
and the Wampanoag (/Wamp*ah*nog/) tribe were all
**instrumental**, or very important, in helping the Pilgrims
survive. Another person who was key to the success of



122


You might remember
from Lesson 7 that William
Bradford was one of the
original colonists who came
over on the Mayflower
and signed the Mayflower
Compact. The Mayflower
Compact outlined what the
first government in America
should look like. The
colonists decided that they
would remain loyal to King
James of England, but they _William Bradford_
would make laws for the good of the colony and follow
those laws. William Bradford was elected governor of
Plymouth in 1621 and held the position for thirty years!
Much of what we know about daily Pilgrim life during
this time comes from the journal he wrote, called _Of_
_Plimoth Plantation_ . In this journal, Bradford wrote about
his experiences on the Mayflower, the events of the first
thirty years in Plymouth, and the colonists’ reactions to
those events.



123


_The first Thanksgiving_

Following the success of that first harvest, Governor
William Bradford organized a feast to celebrate and
give thanks to God for all his **blessings** . At the first
Thanksgiving, the Pilgrims and their friends from the
Wampanoag tribe met to share a meal. Before they
ate, William Bradford said a prayer, which became an
important part of the Thanksgiving feast. His prayer
was a song found in the Christian Bible in the book
of Psalms. The Pilgrims, and many early colonists,
were very familiar with the book of Psalms, which is
composed of over one hundred and fifty songs and
poems. Bradford read from Psalm 107. It begins,



124


“Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; His love
endures forever.” [1]


Bradford's first prayer to establish the Thanksgiving
tradition recognized the struggle of the early colonists
and has been used in many Thanksgiving celebrations
since then as a reminder of those struggles. Think about
the Pilgrims’ decision to leave their homes and travel
across the Atlantic Ocean to reach a totally unknown
land. When they reached Plymouth, they had to build
their colony from the ground up. There were no houses
or stores. That was hard work! Another part of the Psalm
that Bradford read says, “Those He gathered from the
lands, from east and west, from north and south. Some
wandered in desert wastelands, finding no way to a city
where they could settle. They were hungry and thirsty,
and their lives **ebbed** away. Then they cried out to the
Lord in their trouble, and He delivered them from their
**distress** .” [2]


Another part of Bradford's prayer from the Psalm
was “Some went out on the sea in ships; they were
merchants on the mighty waters. They saw the works
of the Lord, His wonderful deeds in the deep. For He
spoke and stirred up a tempest that lifted high the waves.


1 Psalm 107:1
2 Psalm 107: 3–6



125


They mounted up to the heavens and went down to
the depths; in their peril their courage melted away . . .
Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and He
brought them out of their distress. He stilled the storm
to a whisper; the waves of the sea were hushed. They
were glad when it grew calm, and He guided them to
their desired **haven** .” [3]


3 Psalm 107: 23–26, 28–31



126


Think about all that the Pilgrims endured at
Plymouth. Toward the end of Bradford's prayer, the
Psalm said: “There he brought the hungry to live, and
they founded a city where they could settle. They **sowed**
fields and planted vineyards that yielded a fruitful
harvest; He blessed them, and their numbers greatly
increased, and He did not let their herds diminish.” This
part of his prayer describes how people were able to settle
in a new place and live productive and happy lives.



127


Following the success of the first harvest feast, the
**tradition** was repeated each year. Over two hundred
years later, in 1863, President Lincoln declared
Thanksgiving a national holiday. His **proclamation** said,
“I do, therefore, invite my fellow-citizens in every part
of the United States . . . to set apart and observe the last
Thursday of November next as a Day of Thanksgiving.”
This proclamation, or official announcement, was
continued by many presidents after Lincoln. When
President Ronald Reagan made a Thanksgiving Day
proclamation in 1985, he even reminded everyone that
Governor William Bradford was responsible for the
first Thanksgiving Day celebration. He encouraged



128


everyone to spend their day
giving thanks to God for
their blessings.


Every year on
Thanksgiving, the president
of the United States holds
a ceremony at the White
House. The president reads
the Thanksgiving Day
proclamation to remind
citizens of the meaning and _President Lincoln_
purpose of the holiday. The
ceremony ends with the annual Thanksgiving turkey
**pardon** . A pardon is when you forgive someone for an
offense, and they will no longer face consequences. The
president chooses a big turkey, pardons it, and promises
the turkey it will not end up as Thanksgiving dinner!
The first president to pardon a turkey was President
Harry Truman in 1947. This is a fun tradition that
all ages enjoy.

**Religious Dissent**
**and the New**
**England Colonies**



**Read-Aloud**

The Pilgrims had solved some of their problems, but
the Puritans had not. In England, the Puritans were still
struggling to **worship** the way they wanted to. They
wanted to change and purify the Church of England.
When the Puritans heard about the Pilgrims' **colony**
at Plymouth, they decided that they should try to do a
similar thing. They came up with a plan to do just that.


In 1628, a number of Puritans, led by a man named
John Winthrop, decided that they would establish a
**colony** in New England to the north of Plymouth.
The Puritans realized that they would have to be very
organized. They had heard about the hardships faced by
those who had already gone to the colonies. They knew
that many had died due to lack of food and shelter. The
Puritans were determined to avoid these mistakes.


It was decided that a small group of Puritans would



132


_John Winthrop addressing Puritans_

go ahead of the others and begin to build a **colony** . Then,
in 1629, a group of English Puritans and merchants
formed the Massachusetts Bay Company. The aim of the
company was to make money for the Puritan **colony** by
trading furs, as well as by fishing and shipbuilding. (There
would be some farming, too, but the settlers knew that
the rocky New England soil would never support a large
farming economy.)


The company itself would be run according to Puritan
principles, or rules. It was also decided that this Puritan
**colony** would be different from other English colonies.
In order to live in this **colony**, people would have to live
according to how the leaders of the colony interpreted the
Christian Bible and their belief of Christian principles.



133


John Winthrop believed that their **colony** should be
an example to others in terms of how people should live.
He once said, “For we . . . shall be as a City upon a hill;
the eyes of all people are on us.”


Finally, in 1630, John Winthrop set sail for New
England with three ships and about seven hundred
colonists. They brought a good amount of food with
them, as well as cows, horses, and tools. They were
more prepared than any of the other English settlers so
far. When they arrived, there were already some small
buildings in place from the settlement of the first party
they had sent. This settlement was called Salem. Other
settlements were established in Charlestown, Cambridge,
and Boston. This Puritan **colony** was named the
Massachusetts Bay **Colony**, and John Winthrop would
become its governor.




As planned, the Massachusetts Bay **Colony** was
different from the colonies developing in the South.
The careful laws that had been drawn up in England
were put in place in the **colony**, and people had to
follow them. For example, everyone had to go to church.
Those involved in the government of the **colony** were
**senior** church members, and only male church members
could elect their leaders. As you have heard, whereas
the Pilgrims were happy to separate from the Church
of England, the Puritans wanted to remain a part of
it and were determined to change it. They hoped that
by their precise example of **pure** living, the Church of
England would change religious rules that the Puritans
disagreed with.


The Massachusetts
Bay **Colony** was very
successful and grew
quite rapidly. Each
Puritan town was
carefully planned, with
each family being given
enough land on which

_Puritan town_

to build a home and
farm. The most important building in the town was the
meetinghouse. This was where religious services and



135


town meetings were held. Puritans also believed in the
power of education. They wanted their children to be
able to read so they could read the Christian Bible.


In 1631, Roger Williams,
a minister from London,
arrived in the Massachusetts
Bay **Colony** in Boston. Almost
from the beginning, Williams
did not agree with some of the
leaders. He believed that the
leaders of the **colony** had too
much control over people’s lives.
He especially disliked the close
connection between the church
and the government. Williams
felt that what was happening
was too much like the English
system they had tried to escape.
The leaders of the Massachusetts
Bay **Colony** felt **threatened**
by his views.





As more and more people
came to the **colony**, Williams
saw more and more land being
taken from Native Americans.



136


He strongly believed that Native Americans should
be paid for this land. Before long, the leaders of the
Massachusetts Bay **Colony** considered him to be a
troublemaker. Roger Williams was labeled a religious
**dissenter** and was forced to leave the **colony** . There were
some who wanted to send him back to England!


Before they could send him back, however, in 1636,
Roger Williams left the **colony** in the middle of the
night in the dead of winter. A few of his supporters left
with him. It was **bitterly** cold, and he and his followers
had nowhere to go. With the help of some Native
Americans, they survived in the woods for three months.
Eventually, Williams made his way south to what would
become Providence, Rhode Island. There he purchased
land from the Narragansett, a local Native American
**tribe** . This area became the **colony** of Rhode Island.


_Roger_
_Williams_



137


Gradually, others who also found it difficult to follow
the Puritan way of life followed Williams. Rhode Island
became a haven for people who wanted to be free to
practice their faith, or religious beliefs, in their own way.
Rhode Island became the first English **colony** to allow
people complete religious freedom and welcomed not
only Puritans, but Quakers, Roman Catholics, Jews, and
others, too.


Another Puritan who
followed Roger Williams
was a woman named
Anne Hutchinson. She
and her husband and
children had arrived in
the Massachusetts Bay
**Colony** in 1634. As you
have heard, women were
not part of the decisionmaking process in the

_Anne Hutchinson_

church, or in **society** in
general. Women certainly weren’t allowed to **preach**, or
deliver a religious speech or message, in church. Because
of these restrictions, Anne Hutchinson organized weekly
meetings in her home for women who wanted to discuss
these sermons, or religious speeches. In these meetings,



138


women also were free to discuss their religious views.
These meetings became so popular that men, and even
some of the church leaders, began to attend.


Hutchinson openly expressed her view that a person’s
individual faith was more important than being a member
of an organized church. She also said that a person’s
personal relationship with God was the only thing that
really mattered. This was considered by many to be a
very dangerous view because the Puritan church had rules
that were required to be followed. On top of this, Anne
Hutchinson was a woman. So, just like Roger Williams,
Hutchinson was put on trial for being a **dissenter** . During
the trial, Hutchinson was ordered to recant, or take back,
her beliefs and say she changed her mind, but she refused.
Like Roger Williams, she, too, was banished.


In 1638, Anne Hutchinson joined Roger Williams in
Rhode Island. After her husband died, she moved to New
York with her younger children to start a new life. At the
time, New York was called New Netherlands and was a
Dutch **colony** . The governor there did not have a good
reputation with Native Americans and had caused many
disputes between the Native people and the colonists.
He had also created **tension** among various groups of
Native Americans.



139


_Thomas Hooker with settlers in Connecticut_


In 1636, a Puritan minister by the name of Thomas
Hooker also left the Massachusetts Bay **Colony** with a
group of supporters. They made their way to an area that
is now Connecticut and founded the town of Hartford
near a wide river now known as the Connecticut River.
Soon, two more settlements, Windsor and Wethersfield,
were established in the **colony** of Connecticut.


One of the things that Thomas Hooker believed
was that all men should be allowed to vote, not just
those who were members of a church or those who were
wealthy. In 1639, Thomas Hooker implemented a system
of government in Connecticut called the Fundamental
Orders of Connecticut. It was a form of democracy
that later helped to inspire the **creation** of the U.S.
Constitution.



140


We’ve just talked about the **creation** of three of the
four New England colonies. The last New England
**colony** is New Hampshire. You might be surprised
to hear that King James I helped to establish New
Hampshire, too! Remember how he “gave” an area of

this part of North America
to two more of his friends—
John Mason and Ferdinando
Gorges. Later, the two men
divided the land in half,
and Mason got the southern
part that became the New
Hampshire **colony** in 1679.
Many unhappy Puritan settlers
also found their way to this
**colony** . Gorges received the
northern half that would later
become the state of Maine.


As you can see, back in the
17th century, many English

_New Hampshire_

people were willing to risk
their lives to sail to a faraway land in the hope of a
better life. Do you think you would have been willing to
do the same?

**Chapter**
**Puritan Life**
# **14**

Hello, my name is Lizzie. My
mother and father are once again
displeased with me. I smiled too
much during the morning sermon,
and then fell asleep during the
afternoon sermon. They both said
that it is a great sin for a Puritan child to fall asleep while
listening to the word of God.


During the morning sermon, I had smiled at the
sight of Elder Jones’s new wig. I could not understand
why a minister of the church would care to wear such a
thing on his head. But seemingly he does. Not only is it
a strange looking sight, it does not appear to sit straight
on his head.



142


143


As you may or may not know, the most important
place for any Puritan is the meeting house. Every Puritan
meeting house is placed in the center of a town or
village. That is because the meeting house is the center of
our lives. Our church services take place there and so do
all important meetings.


We Puritans live in the Massachusetts Bay **Colony** .
Our **colony** was created in partnership with a Puritan
company called the Massachusetts Bay Company. The
Massachusetts Bay Company sells the fur we get from
hunting and the fish we catch. Our **colony** is becoming
wealthy because of this trading agreement.



144


145


We came here from England in the year 1630. I was
just a baby. Now, I am almost eleven years old. Unlike
the Pilgrims, we did not want to break away from the
Church of England. We wanted the church to be **purer**
and stronger. However, neither King James I nor his son
King Charles I would listen to our requests for change.
In the end, we had no choice but to leave our homes and
start a new life somewhere else.


We chose to create our own Puritan **colony** on land
north of the Pilgrim **colony** of Plymouth. Guided by our
leader John Winthrop, we sent men ahead to prepare the
way for us. They began the construction of houses in an
area we call Salem. They cleared the land for planting.
We now have four settlements within our **colony** .
Apart from Salem, we have Boston, Charlestown,
and Cambridge. The population within our **colony** is
growing rapidly. Each year, hundreds of people come to
live their lives with us. I have heard the grownups say
that even King Charles I cannot believe how successful
and strong we are becoming.



146

Trade ships frequently move in and out of our
**harbors** . I love to watch the men unload items that have
been sent across the ocean. We need guns, tools, and
cloth. We hear news from home by talking to the sailors
and newly arrived colonists. It makes our hearts flutter
when the sailors and passengers talk of life in England.
Just two months ago, I sat on the snow-covered dock and
listened to stories from home. The sailors spoke of the
**glorious** sound of the London church bells ringing out
on Christmas Day. They also reminded us of the smell of
roasting pheasant and sweet plum pudding. As you can
tell, some of us are sometimes homesick but we know
our cause is just and good and worth the **sacrifice** .


People are welcome here, but all who come to live
with us must live according to how we interpret the rules
of the Christian Bible. That is the Puritan way. Thus,
I must surely **mend my ways** . I must not smile during
Elder Jones’s sermon, no matter how long it is. I can tell
you, Elder Jones does like to do a lot of **preaching** .



148


_A sailor delivered supplies and news from home._



149


My brother George keeps pulling my hair and
running away. I have asked him nicely to stop. I have
frowned at him like Mother frowns at me. But still he
continues to do it. I must also make sure that I don’t
wag my finger at him. I must not scold him either. I
have done it twice now, though my mother has not
seen me do it. George is the baby in our family. He is
no longer a real baby as he is four years old. My mother
and father had seven children, but we are the only two
children still alive. Mother and Father make excuses
for George’s behavior, but not for mine. I must be
“responsible Lizzie.”


Well, it seems that Elder Jones is not done **preaching** .
He has called us back to the meeting house for one
more sermon before sunset. I hope he is not wearing
that wig again.

**[The Middle ]**
**Colonies**
# **15**


**Read-Aloud**

The English had now successfully established a
number of colonies in North America. They were
determined to claim more land, which is why in 1664
a fleet of English warships sailed into New Amsterdam
**Harbor**, which is now the New York **Harbor** in New
York City. England promptly claimed the **harbor** as
its own. While they were at it, the English claimed the
city and all the land
around it, too. This was
particularly bold because,
not only were these areas
already Dutch colonies,
but Native Americans
were living there as
well. How and why did
this happen?

_English warships sailing_
_into New Amsterdam_



152


In 1609, Henry
Hudson, an Englishman
exploring for the
Netherlands, set sail
across the Atlantic Ocean
on behalf of the Dutch
East India Company. His
destination was North
America. Hudson, like _Map of Henry Hudson’s route/_

_Henry Hudson_

many other explorers of
the time, was searching
for a northwestern water route to Asia, or what they called
the Northwest Passage.


Although Hudson did not find that route, he did
find an area that is now part of the greater New York
City area. When he arrived in this **harbor**, Hudson
claimed it for the Netherlands. The **harbor** area was
named New Amsterdam, and the **colony** was named New
Netherlands. Hudson did, however, name the Hudson
River after himself. And so, a Dutch **colony** in North
America was established.


Before long, this Dutch **colony** began to develop as an
important fur-trading center. Beaver fur was very popular
in Europe, and Henry Hudson had noted that there was
an abundance in the area.



153


_“Purchase” of Manhattan_


It is believed by many historians that in 1624, Peter
Minuit, the governor of this Dutch **colony**, purchased
the island of Manhattan from a group of local Native
Americans known as the Munsee in exchange for trade
goods worth sixty guilders at the time. A guilder was a
unit of Dutch money, and sixty guilders was very little
compared to the value of the land in Manhattan today.
Because many Native Americans did not share the
Europeans’ concept of private land ownership, historians
are not sure whether the Munsee understood what the
Dutch settlers thought they were purchasing. Nor are



154


historians sure that the Dutch settlers realized that it was
the **custom** of some Native Americans to negotiate for
trade goods in return for allowing others to pass through
or temporarily inhabit the land upon which Natives were
settled. Rather than create boundaries between Native
Americans and the colonists, these exchanges were
meant to be the basis for continuing social connections
between the groups.


So, it seems likely that both parties misunderstood
the nature of the exchange. As a result, conflicts arose
and continued between the colonists and the Munsee
people, just as there had been between colonists and
Native Americans in other regions.


As the Dutch **colony** continued to expand, it began
to attract more Europeans. The **colony** allowed for
certain religious freedom, so people who were not very
happy with the leaders of their churches began to leave
their homes and arrive in the colonies. This **colony**
had excellent land for farming and a growing fur trade.
English colonists had set their sights on this area, too.
For quite some time they had **concentrated**, or focused,
on establishing colonies to the north and south of
what is now New York, but in 1664 they turned their
attention to this area.



155


At this time in England, Charles II was king. His
father, Charles I, had been killed because he was not
well liked by the people, and Charles II had been forced
to leave England. Later, in 1660, Charles II was invited
to return and become king. If you remember, King
Charles II had acquired, or built up, a great deal of
**debt** . This happened during the ten years that he had
been living in exile. During this time, Charles II had
borrowed an enormous amount of money from friends.
It’s not easy to live like a king when you are not actually
recognized as one.


When Charles II reclaimed his throne, he looked
to North America to solve his **debt** problems. As you
know, he had already given land that did not belong
to him in the South to several of his loyal friends. You
might ask: “Why didn’t he give away parts of England?”
Well, because that was against English law. There was no
such law in place to protect the land in North America,
and Charles believed he was entitled to claim this land.
Charles II based this belief on the fact that John Cabot
had explored North America for England back in the late
1400s, well before Henry Hudson had done so for the
Dutch in the early 1600s.



156


_Peter Stuyvesant surrenders to the English_


King Charles II put his brother James in charge of
coming up with a plan to take New Netherlands from
the Dutch. In 1664, James, also known as the Duke of
York, sent a number of warships to New Amsterdam
**Harbor** . The Dutch had been taken by surprise. Not
only was New Amsterdam poorly defended, but the
townspeople did not particularly like their over bearing
governor at the time, Peter Stuyvesant ( _stie_ -vuh-sant).
They were unwilling to risk their lives for him against
the English, so Peter Stuyvesant had no choice but
to surrender.


And so, the Duke of York had carried out his mission
without firing a single shot. King Charles II was very
pleased indeed. Although the Dutch did try to take
their **colony** back several times, they were **ultimately**



157


unsuccessful, and by 1669, the area was officially deemed
an English **colony** . In honor of the Duke of York, New
Amsterdam became known as New York City, and New
Netherlands was now the **colony** of New York.


Not wanting to
be too greedy, and
ever grateful to loyal
supporters of the
monarchy, the Duke of
York gave the southern
part of the **colony** of
New York to two of
his good friends. These
friends were George
Carteret and John
Berkeley. This area later
became known as New
Jersey, named after the
Isle of Jersey in the
English Channel.



_New Jersey_



Soon after, the
English took an area,
known as Delaware,
away from the Dutch,
too. So, the English had



158


now established colonies in three **distinct** regions: the
Southern colonies, which were made up of Maryland,
Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia;
the New England colonies, made up of Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire; and
the Middle colonies, made up of New York, New Jersey,
and the soon-to-be Pennsylvania, and Delaware.


The population in the Middle colonies grew
rapidly. These colonies attracted not only English
people, but people from many other European
countries, too. In fact, the population in all of the
English colonies grew, and within one hundred
years after King Charles II reclaimed his throne, the
population would grow to be two million! Two of the
most populous cities in North America at this time
were located in the Middle Atlantic region: New York
City and Philadelphia. These cities grew into bustling
commercial centers with large populations.


People who moved to the Middle colonies from
another country brought with them their own individual
languages, culture, and range of skills. The people who
settled in the Middle colonies were particularly **diverse**,
or varied. You can imagine hundreds of new arrivals
speaking different languages, wearing different kinds of
clothing, building different types of homes, and eating



159


_Newly arriving settlers_


many different kinds of food. Despite their differences,
however, the people who moved to North America all had
one thing in common: they wanted a better life.


There were also many different reasons people chose
to come to the Middle colonies. One was that this region
had good **harbor** areas and long, wide rivers. The English
knew that this region would be good for trade. Another
reason some people were drawn to the Middle colonies
was that the people in charge of governing those colonies
were generally tolerant of people’s religions. For the most
part, the day-to-day decisions were made by elected



160


officials in town and county assemblies in the Middle
colonies; however, the Duke of York, George Carteret,
and John Berkeley were **ultimately** in charge.


Another reason people moved to the Middle colonies
was because it was a good area in which to farm. The
climate and soil in the Middle colonies, compared to the
North and South, were perfect for farming. In terms of
climate, it was neither too hot nor too cold.



161


Wheat grew well in these conditions. As a result,
these Middle colonies earned the name “the breadbasket”
because they could grow a lot of wheat and supply
large amounts of flour to England, as well as to other
English colonies—particularly in the West Indies. Many
**mills** were built in this region to grind the wheat into
flour. The flour was packaged and exported. Other
crops, such as **rye**, potatoes, peas, and flax, also thrived.
Farming became the main **occupation**, or job. There
were other **occupations**, too. There was also a need for
sailors, trappers, lumbermen, merchants, and craftsmen.
Shipbuilding became an important industry, too.


There were some enslaved Africans in the Middle
colonies, just as there were in the Southern colonies.
Unlike the Southern colonies, people in the Middle
colonies used the rapidly growing population as their
main source of workers, and they paid them wages.
As a result, there was less dependence on **slavery** than
in the South.



162


Builders were needed in the Middle colonies, too.
People built houses of different styles, often reflecting
the cultures of the places in Europe from where they had
come. Networks of roads, though very basic, were slowly
developing. The Great Wagon Road became an important
“highway,” stretching from Pennsylvania, south through
Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. Workshops,
stores, and coffee shops were opening. Thanks to an
English king who needed money, a vibrant new culture
was emerging three thousand miles away.

**Chapter**

**[The Quakers and ]**
**the Lenni Lenape**
# **16**

Charles, Hester, and their father,
Micah, walked slowly toward the

some of the families who lived in their small Quaker
**colony** . Just one year earlier, in 1685, some of the young
Lenni Lenape men had helped several newly-arrived
English and Welsh Quakers clear land for farming.


The gifts they carried were in three straw baskets.
The baskets were heavy and Charles and Hester struggled
to carry theirs. The baskets held dumplings, cheese,
bread, apple butter, and ham.


Neither Charles nor Hester were nervous about
visiting the village. They had been there several times
before with their father. They had even been inside some
of the homes, called wigwams. In fact, both children
had been **astonished** by how warm and dry these homes
made of bark were.



164


_Charles, Hester, and Micah delivered gifts to the Lenni Lenape._



165


The village was on the bank of a long, winding river.
In the village, there were about thirty wigwams and four
longhouses. Like the wigwams, the longhouses were
made from a wooden frame covered in bark. Unlike the
wigwams, though, several families lived together in one
longhouse. On the **outskirts** of the village, the children
could see the Lenni Lenape fields full of corn, squash,
and beans. In the river near the bank, four dugout
canoes were bobbing up and down in the water. Two of
the canoes held piles of raccoon, beaver, and fox fur. This
fur was a sign that some of the Lenni Lenape men would
soon be setting off to trade with either Europeans or
other Native Americans.



166


_Lenni Lenape men loaded fur into their canoes._



167


Charles and Hester were Quakers from a part of
England called the Midlands. They had arrived in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the previous year with their
parents. Philadelphia was a growing town in the English
**colony** known as Pennsylvania. In 1681, William Penn,
a Quaker and the leader of this **colony**, had received the
land now known as Pennsylvania from King Charles II
of England. The king had given him the land to settle
a **debt** he owed to William’s father. William Penn was
grateful to the king because he wanted this land to be a
place where Quakers could live without fear. Quakers
were **persecuted** in England. They were often arrested
and some were killed because of their beliefs.



168


_William Penn’s father (left) and William Penn (right)_



169


Quakers were unpopular because they did not believe
in war, and therefore, refused to fight. Also, they did
not think that there was only one way to **worship** God.
They did not think that it was necessary to have a priest
or pastor to **worship**, either. They also believed that
everyone was equal in the eyes of God, which meant
that Native Americans and Africans who were enslaved
were equal, too. These views made members of the king’s
government very angry. The king himself was not pleased
with them. William Penn decided that it was time to
find a safe place for Quakers to live.


Before leaving England in 1681, William Penn drew
up a plan for the city of Philadelphia. He wanted it to
have wide, tree-lined streets and public parks. He wanted
Philadelphia to be a magnificent city within the **colony**
of Pennsylvania. He wanted it to be a place where people
lived in such a way that they were an example to the
rest of the world. People of all faiths, not only Quakers,
would be welcome.



170


_William Penn’s plan for the city of Philadelphia_



171


As the children neared the village, a Lenni
Lenape boy ran toward them. He had clearly been
waiting for them.


“Hello, Lapowinsa,” said Charles to the boy.


“Hey,” replied Lapowinsa. “What do you have in
the baskets?”


Both Charles and Hester had taught Lapowinsa to
speak English. He was their friend and they enjoyed
spending time with him.


“We have gifts,” Hester replied. Lapowinsa joined
the children as they marched behind their father into the
Lenni Lenape village.


The people in the village smiled at the children’s
father. They came to greet him. Charles always **admired**
the breechcloths and leggings, worn in cold weather, that
the men wore. The women wore dresses, and their long,
dark hair was braided. The men, women, and children
wore moccasins on their feet.



172


_Lapowinsa greeted Charles and Hester._



173


The children’s father had learned to speak a little of
the Lenni Lenape language. With William Penn, he had
been involved in the purchase of the land they lived on
from the Lenni Lenape.


After handing over the gifts, their father was invited
to spend time with some of the Lenni Lenape men. This
meant that Charles, Hester, and Lapowinsa would get a
chance to play. The children began to walk toward the
river. Lapowinsa had promised to take them out in a
canoe to search for turtles.


“Be back before sunset,” their father called. The
children nodded and then with Lapowinsa leading the
way, they ran like the wind across the open land.


In your opinion, how might Lapowinsa be different
from Charles and Hester’s friends in England?

**Chapter** **[Matthew, ]**

**the Apprentice**
#### **17**

“Matthew, have you finished
printing those newspapers?” Uncle
Abraham asked.


“Almost,” Matthew replied.





“Well, when you are done, I need you to deliver
these sermons to Pastor Keller. He’s waiting for them,”
continued Uncle Abraham. “Oh, and when you get
back from delivering the sermons, you will need to
make more ink.”


Matthew nodded his head to let his uncle know that
he had heard his instructions. In 1755, Matthew was
a printer’s **apprentice** . He was **originally** from a small
village thirty miles north of Philadelphia. Matthew’s
father was a cooper there. A cooper is a skilled **craftsman**
who knows how to make casks, buckets, barrels, and
containers of all shapes and sizes. In the colonies, almost
every kind of food and drink was stored in the kinds of
containers his father made.



176


_Matthew printing newspapers_



177


When Matthew was little, he had thought that
he would one day work with his father. However,
his older brother Jonah had become their father’s
**apprentice** . From the age of seven until he was ten,
Matthew had attended a one-room schoolhouse where
he was fortunate enough to have been taught how to
read and write.


Four days after his eleventh birthday, Matthew’s
Uncle Abraham had come to visit. During his visit,
he had offered Matthew the opportunity to move to
Philadelphia and become his **apprentice** . At first,
Matthew had not wanted to leave his family. He
had three younger sisters he loved dearly, along with
his brother Jonah. However, Matthew’s parents had
explained to him that he would have to learn a skill so
that when he grew up he too could support a family.



178


_Uncle Abraham offered Matthew the opportunity to become his_
_**apprentice**_ _._



179


Before Uncle Abraham left, Matthew had signed an
**apprenticeship** agreement that stated that he “would
faithfully serve his uncle, keep his secrets, and obey all of
his lawful commands.” For his part, Uncle Abraham had
agreed to spend seven years teaching him the skills he
needed to be a successful printer. During that time, he
would house, feed, and clothe Matthew. Four weeks after
his uncle’s visit, Matthew’s father had loaded up their
wagon and they had set off for Philadelphia.



180


_Matthew signed the_ _**apprenticeship**_ _agreement._



181


In Philadelphia, Matthew and his father had spent
two days exploring the city with Uncle Abraham. Then
on the third day, his father had bought supplies for his
workshop and said goodbye. Matthew had watched his
father go until he was out of sight. Though his eyes filled
with tears, Matthew willed them not to fall.


Four years had passed since that day. Now, Matthew
was fifteen years old. Matthew had three more years to
serve as an **apprentice** . When his seven years of training
were finished, Matthew would become a journeyman.
A journeyman was a skilled printer, though not yet a
master **craftsman** . Matthew would spend three more
years working alongside his uncle and he would receive
payment for his work. When he turned twenty-one years
of age, Matthew hoped to become a master **craftsman**
and open up his own business.



182


183


Matthew finished printing the last newspaper.
Printing newspapers was one of the hardest jobs of
all. It could take more than twenty hours to print one
page. All of the work was done by hand. This included
organizing tiny pieces of metal with individual letters
or punctuation marks on them into the order in which
they had to appear on the printed page. This task was
called setting the type. The type was then held firmly
in place as an inking pad spread ink over the type. The
printing press transferred the carefully arranged words
and sentences onto paper.


Matthew picked up the bundle of printed sermons
and quickly checked to see if he had all of the ingredients
needed to make the ink when he returned. Ink was
made from **tannin**, iron sulfate, gum, and water. He was
happy to see that Uncle Abraham had stocked up on
these supplies.



184


_Matthew and a freshly printed newspaper_



185


Out on the street, Matthew made his way toward
the small wooden church at the end of the avenue.
Pastor Keller was the Lutheran minister in charge of
this church. As Matthew walked, a small, shaggy, brown
dog came to keep him company. The dog had appeared
several times earlier in the week near the door to their
kitchen. Matthew had thrown it some scraps, and now it
appeared whenever Matthew did.


“Hey, you want to come with me?” Matthew asked as
he clicked his fingers.


The small dog looked up at Matthew and
wagged its tail.


“Okay then,” said Matthew. “Let’s go.” Matthew
began to run down the avenue, taking care to hold on
tight to his **delivery** . The small brown dog scampered
happily after him.

**Colonies, Part I**



“Primrose, come see the kittens that
have just been born,” yelled Patience,
Primrose’s sister.





“See, there are six of them,” Patience
continued as her sister appeared at her side. Primrose sat
down next to Patience as she pointed to a spot beneath a
large shrub, where the mother cat and her kittens lay.


The two girls stared long and hard at the tiny
creatures. There were six kittens in all. Their eyes were
closed, and they could not walk. They lay in a heap
together beside their mother.


“I want to keep one as my own,” said Patience.


“Well, you can’t yet,” Primrose replied. “They have
to stay with their mother for at least ten or eleven weeks.
Then, you’ll have to ask Mama and Papa.



188


_Patience found a litter of kittens._



189


They’ll say no though. They don’t like us keeping
animals inside the house.”


“I’ll hide it in a safe place,” said Patience firmly.


“Where?” asked Primrose quite seriously. “Where will
you hide it? I can’t think of one place that Mama and
Papa wouldn’t find it.”


“In a bucket,” announced Patience confidently.


“Do you think that a kitten will stay in a bucket
all day, waiting for you to finish your chores?” laughed
Primrose. “Do you think Mama and Papa won’t notice
you carrying a bucket around everywhere?”


Patience thought about this for a while before she
replied. Then she said, “The kitten will stay in the
bucket if I train her to.” Patience chose to ignore the
second part of Primrose’s question.


The two girls continued to debate about whether
or not it was possible to hide a kitten in their small log
house without anyone noticing. Like many colonial
cabins, theirs consisted of two small rooms downstairs
and three very small bedrooms upstairs. Primrose and
Patience shared a bedroom, as did their three brothers.



190


_Primrose tried to talk Patience out of her idea to keep a kitten_
_for herself._



191


Primrose and Patience lived on a farm in southern
New Jersey. They and the rest of their family were
**originally** from Sweden. They had moved to this
English **colony** because of their Uncle Sven. He had
written to their father and told him about the wonderful
life they could have there.


Uncle Sven had traveled to New Jersey from Sweden
in 1699. That was exactly thirty years after the English
had taken control of this region from the Dutch. Uncle
Sven was now a successful wheat farmer.


The girls and their family had arrived in New Jersey
in 1701. Primrose and Patience lived with their father,
mother, and three brothers on a one hundred acre farm.
On their farm, they grew wheat, **rye**, and **barley** . They
kept cows, pigs, and chickens, too. Most people in
the Middle Atlantic colonies lived on small farms that
ranged from fifty acres to one hundred fifty acres. These
farms were quite spread apart, and neighbors didn’t
see much of each other except at church on Sunday.
Sometimes they got together for special **occasions** or if
someone needed help.



192


_Patience and her family doing chores_



193


The farm that the girls lived on had a house and
a large barn. They had a garden where they grew
vegetables, berries, and fruits. They had a small orchard,
too. Their garden was fenced, as was the area where
they kept their pigs. Their cows were sent out to **graze**
in the pasture each morning and brought back into the
barn each night for milking. Their farm animals were
valuable, and they kept a close eye on them.


After a while, the girls’ older brother Lars found
them by the shrub. Lars had been sent to look for them
by their father. He sat down beside the girls and peeked
at the kittens. Finally, he spoke.


“You two are needed in the barn. Papa wants you
to lead the cows out into the pasture. Then, Mama
wants you to weed and water the garden. After that, she
wants you to go inside and help her with the new quilt
she is making.”



194


195


Primrose and Patience sighed. They knew they had
several hours of chores ahead of them. Next week would
be even busier. It was spring cleaning week. They would
have to help Mama make soap before they cleaned and
swept out the whole house.


Before scampering off, Patience knelt down and kissed
the small pile of newborn kittens. “I’ll be back later,”
she whispered.





196


_Patience kissed the kittens._

**Chapter**
##### **19**



**Life on a Farm in**
**the Middle Atlantic**
**Colonies, Part II**



Do you remember that in the last
chapter, you read a story about Patience
and Primrose? They found something very
special under a shrub. Who can remember
what it was? When you left them, they had
set off to do their chores. Let’s find out what’s
happened to them.





The girls’ uncle had given them good **advice** about
the Middle Atlantic colonies. These colonies offered
people from Europe new opportunities as well as
religious freedom. Although these were English colonies,
Germans, Dutch, French, Swedish, and Irish people
came to live in New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and
Pennsylvania. Every day, more and more people arrived
to start a new life.



198


_Colonists arrived from many different European countries._



199


Papa often told the children stories about his trips
into town. He would tell them of all the different
languages he heard being spoken there. He would
describe the people who came from many different parts
of Europe. He would **occasionally** bring home strange
and unusual foods he had bought from the market or the
street vendors. One of their favorites was English ‘pop
robbins’. The girls looked forward to the delicious balls
of batter made from flour and eggs boiled in milk. Papa
would describe the styles of clothes people wore and the
different **customs** he had heard about.


Almost all of their neighbors were from different
parts of Europe. Their closest neighbor was a family
from Germany. In the first years of the 18th century,
German families had begun to arrive in this **colony** . At
harvest thanksgiving time, their German neighbors had
cooked scrapple and brought it to their home. The boys
had loved this pudding dish of meat and grain. The girls
were less thrilled, but they had loved the apple strudel
that followed. The girls and their family had also been
invited to visit with an Irish family who lived about a
mile away. Mama had been amazed by how much the
Irish family liked to eat butter and cream.



200


_Families from different countries ate together._



201


It was a well-known fact that the Middle Atlantic
colonies produced more food than the New England
colonies. The soil in the Middle Atlantic colonies was so
much better for farming. For this reason, these colonies
had earned the name ‘the breadbasket of the colonies’.
They produced huge amounts of **rye**, **barley**, and wheat,
their most important crop. Farmers sent their grain
harvest to the water-powered **mills** across the region. At
the **mills**, the grain was turned into flour. The flour was
sold to other colonies and to people in the West Indies.
It was even sold to English merchants, who shipped it
to England. The girls’ mother often joked that they were
helping to feed the King of England himself.



202


_A water-powered_ _**mill**_



203


The Middle Atlantic colonies were not only known
for farming. Along the coast, fisherman fished and
skilled craftsmen built boats and ships. Men cut down
trees from the forests and turned them into lumber to be
used to make boats as well as to be shipped to towns and
cities in England.


Because people of different faiths were free to
**worship** as they wished, different kinds of churches were
springing up throughout the Middle Atlantic colonies.
There were various Christian churches, including the
Lutheran church that the girls’ family attended. Like
the children’s family, most of the Swedish settlers were
Lutheran. There were Jewish temples, too. Small, oneroomed schoolhouses were also beginning to appear.
Only boys could attend them. The girls’ two older
brothers went to school to learn reading, writing, and
manners. When they weren’t at school, Papa taught the
boys how to hunt, farm, build fences, and make tools.



204


205


Primrose and Patience went about doing their chores.
They led the cows into the pasture. The cows followed
them **obediently** along the familiar track. After that,
they weeded and watered the newly planted vegetable
garden, stopping only once to drink water from the well
and to put on their sun bonnets. They did not speak
much as they worked. Primrose hummed to herself as
she worked though. As they neared the end of their task,
Patience looked up and exclaimed, “I know! I will hide
my kitten in my pocket. That way, she can come with
me everywhere I go. Her name will be Midnight.”


Primrose glanced at her sister and sighed. There was
no point disagreeing with her or even pointing out the
fact that her kitten would grow into a cat. It was clear
that Patience was determined to have a pet kitten.



206


_Patience and Primrose weeded the vegetable garden._



207


When they were done with the weeding, Primrose
stood up and looked toward their cabin.


“We had better go help Mama with the quilt. Now
that it is springtime, maybe she will make each of us a
new dress,” she said hopefully. “I would also like some
new ribbon for my hair.”


Patience’s eyes lit up. “I want a blue dress with a very
large pocket,” she said excitedly. “And some yarn for
Midnight to play with.”


With that, the two girls ran off to find their mother.

**Chapter**

**[The Road to ]**
**Revolution, Part I**
# **20**


**Read-Aloud**

You have learned about how the English colonies
were established and how the colonists lived their
lives. Throughout this time, the English, Spanish, and
French colonists fought each other over land in North
America. They were land hungry and clashed over the
areas of North America they wanted for themselves. The
Spanish conquistadors had forced the French colonists
out of what is present-day Florida and gained control

North America
including present-day
New Mexico. The
French settlers were
colonizing parts of
present-day Canada
and had also claimed
the Mississippi River
_soldiers_



210


valley for France. Whereas some of these land claims
resulted in wars on European soil, other clashes were
beginning to take place in North America.


At the same time, more and more Europeans were
coming to the English colonies and searching for land to
settle. They began to move further west, away from the
coastal areas where people had first settled. Over time,
Native Americans began to realize that there would be no
end to the **influx** of people.


In 1675, war broke out in New England. After years
of friction and conflict, Wampanoag warriors attacked
homesteads and colonists retaliated. Chief Metacom, the
son of Chief Massasoit [mass-uh- _so_ -it], led a war party
against some English settlers. This turned into an all-out
conflict. Eventually,
the English settlers
won. Only about
four hundred of
the Wampanoag
survived, and the
settlers took even
more of their land.


_Wampanoag approaching English_
_settlement_



211


As the colonies grew, English explorers continued
west across the Appalachian Mountains to what is
now the Ohio River Valley. However this land was not
uninhabited either. Native Americans had been living in
this region for a long time; some of them had to move
west away from the eastern regions when the **influx** of
settlers arrived. The French colonists had also claimed
a few areas of the Ohio Valley. They had established a
good trading partnership with various Native **tribes** in
the area. They didn’t want the English settlers to interfere
with this business relationship.


Neither Native Americans nor the French colonists
wanted English settlers to build homes upon this land.
However, the British Lieutenant Governor of Virginia,
Robert Dinwiddie, wrote to the French military
commander in the Ohio Valley, insisting that the land
belonged to Great Britain and demanding that the
French government abandon its claim to it.


The French military commander considered this
request and then replied: “Non!”


Yet another war broke out in 1754. This war is known
as the French and Indian War, although it was primarily
between Great Britain and France. Fought in the forests of
North America, this war went on for a very long time—



212


_French and Indian War battle scene_

almost nine years in all. George Washington and many
other colonists were in favor of the war, hoping to gain more
territory, and fought on the side of the British. The British
government also sent thousands of soldiers across the Atlantic
Ocean to fight. There were Native Americans on both sides of
the war, although many of them tried to stay out of it. Some
were pressured into choosing a side in the conflict and fighting
for it, often because the British or French threatened to cut off
trade if they didn’t participate. Many Native Americans in the
region, such as the Huron, fought with the French colonists.
Others, such as the Iroquois, sided with the British.


Two years later, the war over the colonial territory in
North America spread to other parts of the world where



213


France and Great Britain competed for land, such as
Europe, the West Indies, and India. This phase of the
war is known as the Seven Years War in Great Britain.


Eventually, after much conflict, the British captured
the French-controlled city of Quebec, Canada. The
capture of Quebec in 1759 was a turning point for
the British, who eventually won the war. In 1763, the
war was over, but this was the beginning of the end for
French fortune in North America.


Although the French and the British signed a peace
treaty, some Native Americans continued to fight for
their land. They were led by Chief Pontiac of the Ottawa
tribe, and so their fight became known as “Pontiac’s
Rebellion.” But these attempts actually involved a vast
network of at least thirteen Native American tribes
which united together around protecting their people.
Chief Pontiac and the Native American tribes were
successful. The British soon realized that it would be
very difficult and very expensive to try to defeat them.
As a result, the British Parliament and King George III
decided that settlers should not live on land west of the
Appalachian Mountains. In 1763, King George issued a
proclamation forbidding it.


Fighting a war for many years is a very expensive



214


_King George III before Parliament; Proclamation being read_


thing to do. When it was over, the British Parliament
realized that they had spent a great deal of money. Britain
was in financial trouble, and someone had to help get
them out of it. That someone was the thirteen colonies.


The prime minister of Great Britain at the end of
the French and Indian War was a man named George
Grenville. Grenville was asked to come up with a plan to
pay off Britain’s **debt** . He thought long and hard about
this and did indeed come up with a plan. “How about
**taxing** the colonists?” he thought to himself. “After all,
Great Britain fought the war to defend the colonists
against the French and Native Americans!” Grenville
presented his plan to King George III and Parliament.
King George and most members of the British parliament
agreed that it was a great plan.



215


In 1764, the British Parliament passed the Sugar Act.
This law placed a tax on foreign sugar and molasses. By
making foreign sugar and molasses more expensive, the
colonists were being forced to buy these goods from the
British producers in the West Indies. However, this act
did not just include sugar; it also included cloth, coffee,
and silk. The colonists were now taxed if they chose to
buy less expensive products from other nations.


Then in 1765, the British Parliament passed the
Stamp Act. The Stamp Act stated that all printed
materials produced in the colonies would be taxed.
Newspapers, magazines, legal documents, and—believe
it or not—even a deck of playing cards, would cost more.
People were required to buy a stamp and place it on the
paper item they had purchased.


In the same year, the Quartering Act was passed by
the British Parliament. This meant that colonists had to
help provide quarters, or temporary places to live, for the
British soldiers stationed in the colonies. The colonists
also had to provide supplies, such as food, bedding,
candles, and firewood.


For many years, the colonists had handled their own
affairs. Now, members of a government three thousand
miles away had voted to tax the colonists. The colonists
were not allowed to vote for these British leaders, so



216


_American colonists read the Stamp Act_


they felt their views and thoughts were not represented
in the British government. Many colonists believed that
it was unfair that they had to pay taxes, but did not have
**representation** in the British Parliament. The British
responded that members of Parliament considered the
interests of the entire empire, and not simply the areas they
represented.


Although most people had accepted the Sugar Act and
the Quartering Act, they were not prepared to accept the
Stamp Act without a fight. Some **outspoken** colonists
began to suggest that they should not pay it. They cried,
“No taxation without **representation** !”

**Read-Aloud**

As you have heard, the colonists were in strong
opposition to the taxes Great Britain kept heaping on
them. Their famous words were, “No taxation without
**representation** !”


_Patrick Henry before House of Burgesses speaking against tax_



218


One man in particular, Patrick Henry, began to
speak up. Patrick Henry was a Virginia lawyer. In
Williamsburg, Virginia, he stood before the House of
Burgesses and spoke out against the king and the new
tax. Patrick Henry stated that only colonial governments
should have the power to introduce new taxes in
the colonies.


In 1765, the twenty-seven elected leaders of nine
colonies made their way to New York. They met to
discuss what could be done about the Stamp Act. This
meeting became known as the Stamp Act Congress.
Members of the Congress informed the British
Parliament that this tax was **unjust** .


Another **outspoken** leader at this time was a man
named Samuel Adams from Massachusetts. He organized
a group of people who became known as the Sons of
Liberty. These men protested in the streets, burned the
stamps, and **threatened** the agents whose job it was to
collect the taxes. It soon became impossible to impose
the Stamp Act. And so in 1766, the British Parliament
was forced to repeal it. When the colonists heard this
news, they celebrated their victory.



219


_Sons of Liberty protesting_

Members of Parliament were not happy. King George
insisted that it was Britain’s right to tax the colonies.
A new plan was needed. This time, a man named Charles
Townshend had another idea. They would put a tax on
items that they knew the colonists really needed. These
items—which were used daily in colonial times to make
many things—included paint, paper, glass, lead, tea,
wool, and silk.


In response, the colonists decided to **boycott** these
items from Britain. They began to make their own
products. Colonists purchased tea from other sources or
drank “liberty tea” made from herbs and berries. Many
women even began making their own cloth. This hurt
British manufacturers, and before long, this tax was also
removed—that is, all except for the tax on tea. So, the
colonists’ **boycott** of British tea continued.



220


Alarmed by the level of protests, Britain sent troops
to the colonies. They arrived in Boston **Harbor** in
1768. The colonists did not like the presence of British
soldiers, especially because the soldiers had been sent to
control them. **Tension** between the colonists and Britain
continued to grow.


In 1770, a scuffle, or brief fight, broke out in Boston
between British soldiers and a group of colonists. In the
confusion, British soldiers fired their guns into the crowd
and killed five colonists, injuring six others. The first
to die was a man named Crispus Attucks. People were
horrified. The soldiers were immediately arrested. This
terrible event became known as the Boston Massacre.
The relationship between the colonists and Britain was
becoming much worse.


_Boston Massacre; Crispus Attucks_



221


It would not be fair to say that tea caused the
American Revolution, but it played a part. The colonists
were still refusing to buy tea from Britain. And King
George and his government were refusing to listen to the
colonists. In 1773, the British Parliament introduced a
new law called the Tea Act. This time, they said that the
British East India Company would no longer have to pay
the tax on tea, but colonial merchants would still have
to pay the tax. That would give the British company an
unfair advantage over the colonial merchants with whom
they were competing.


_Boston Tea Party_



222


The colonists responded that, not only did they not
want this tea, they didn’t want trade ships bringing it
into the colonies either. In other words, they would give
up drinking British tea altogether.


In 1773, three British trade ships loaded with tea
appeared in the Boston **Harbor** . The Sons of Liberty
took action. Wearing elements of Native American war
clothing, they threw all of the tea into the water! This
event became known as The Boston Tea Party.


Now the king was really mad. You could say the
colonists’ “actions spoke louder than their words.” The
British government decided to punish this **colony** . A
British general was placed in control of Massachusetts.
Boston **Harbor** was closed, and more British soldiers
were sent to Boston. With the port closed, many colonial
businesses began to suffer. The colonists called these
recent British decisions the Intolerable Acts because they
were not willing to put up with them.



223


Rather than back down, the colonists began to join
together. Many colonists were even more convinced
now that the British did not understand them or care
about them.


Colonists were now daring to think about, and talk
about, establishing their **independence** from England
and becoming their own nation. Those who wanted to
become independent, or free, of England were called
Patriots. People still loyal to England and the king were
known as Loyalists.



224


It was clear that the colonists’ relationship with
Britain was changing, and elected leaders of the colonies
had to decide what to do. George Washington, John
Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Benjamin
Franklin, John Hancock, and other leaders came together
for a gathering in Philadelphia known as the First
Continental Congress.


In this meeting, the leaders voted to end all trade
with Britain until Britain repealed the Intolerable
Acts. Most people still hoped that these **issues** could
be resolved peacefully. However, it was decided that
each **colony** should begin to store weapons and train
men for war.


On April 18, 1775, British soldiers were given
information about colonial weapons that had been
secretly stored in a town called Concord, about twenty
miles from Boston. The soldiers were ordered to seize the
weapons and destroy them. The British soldiers began to
march toward Concord. A colonist named Paul Revere
rode through the night to inform his fellow Patriots that
the British were coming.



225


Perhaps you are familiar with this first part of a
famous poem called “Paul Revere’s Ride” by Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow, based on this historic event:


_Listen, my children, and you shall hear_

_Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,_

_On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five:_

_Hardly a man is now alive_

_Who remembers that famous day and year._

_He said to his friend, “If the British march_

_By land or sea from the town to-night,_

_Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch_

_Of the North Church tower as a signal-light,_

_One, if by land, and two, if by sea;_

_And I on the opposite shore will be . . .”_


Paul Revere saw the signal of two lanterns lit by his
friend in the church tower. That meant the British were
coming by sea, so he rode all night to Concord to warn
the colonists. Although Paul Revere was captured, the
colonial solders, called Minutemen, were warned by two
other men who rode with Revere: William Dawes and
Samuel Prescott. This allowed them to prepare for the
arrival of the British.



226


_Paul Revere’s Ride_


The very first shots of the American Revolution
were fired in Lexington on April 19, 1775, as the British
soldiers were on their way to Concord. Historians are
not certain who fired the first shot. Several Minutemen
died in this exchange of fire. The British soldiers
continued their march toward Concord. However, when
they got there, the weapons were nowhere to be found.



227


The historic ride of Paul Revere and others had
warned the colonists in time for them to move their
weapons. The British began to retreat. As they did, they
were fired upon by Minutemen. Many British soldiers
were killed.


A second gathering of leaders from each **colony** was
called in the city of Philadelphia, which would later
become the first capital of the United States. Shortly
before this meeting, Patrick Henry had uttered these
famous words: “I know not what course others may take,
but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!”


_Declaration of_ _**Independence**_ _; the Stars and Stripes colonial flag_



228


At this Second Continental Congress, George
Washington was chosen to be the Commander-in-Chief
in charge of an army that did not yet fully exist, but
which the leaders anticipated they would soon need.


During this time, many letters and petitions were
sent to King George. Among them was the Declaration
of **Independence**, primarily penned by Thomas Jefferson
and approved by the Founding Fathers on July 4, 1776.


King George responded by ignoring the colonists’
requests and sending more British soldiers to the
colonies. The long and difficult battle for American
**independence** had begun.
