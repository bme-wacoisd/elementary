### **[Introduction: ]** **Meet** **Rattenborough**
# **1**

Greetings! Rattenborough, the famous explorer and
animal expert here! Remember me? I taught you all
about animals and **habitats** when you were just little
kids in first grade� I’ve been busy since then traveling
around the world� But, I’m back now to teach you
everything I’ve learned about animals during my travels�


First, let’s take a quick look at what you learned
in first grade� Do you remember what a **habitat** is?
A **habitat** is the place where animals and plants live�
We learned that there are different **ecosystems** all over
the world with different kinds of animals and plants
living there� Ecosystems are larger environments where
organisms live and work together�


We visited a desert **ecosystem** where it was very hot
and dry� It hardly ever rains in a desert so the plants and
animals that live there have to be able to get by with very
little water� I bet you remember that cactus plants live in
the desert, along with snakes and lizards�

We also visited an African savanna� A savanna is also
called a grassland� There were lots of interesting animals
living there—zebras, elephants, and even lions! To be
perfectly honest, I was always a little nervous while we
were in the savanna!


Next, we checked out some different kinds of forests�
We went to a hardwood forest full of trees with leaves
that change color and drop off in the fall� We saw
squirrels, deer, and even bears� We saw lots of different
kinds of birds in those tall trees�


Then, we visited a tropical rainforest that was very
hot, humid, and wet� There were lots of birds in this
forest, too� These birds were colorful, tropical birds like
toucans and parrots�

_Rattenborough in three_ _**habitats**_

Last, but not least, we visited freshwater and saltwater
**habitats** - In the freshwater **habitat**, we saw fish, turtles,
ducks, and beavers� In the saltwater **habitat** of the sea,
we saw starfish, crabs, lobsters, and sharks!

_Rattenborough in two water_ _**habitats**_

Besides learning about **habitats** in first grade, we also
studied the different kinds of things that animals eat�
Do you remember talking about **herbivores**, **carnivores**,
and **omnivores** ? We learned that you can sort animals by
what they eat�


So, get ready because we are going to learn a lot
more about how to sort animals� Rattenborough, your
personal animal expert, at your service!


See you next time!

**Chapter**
### **Classifying** **Living Things**
# **2**

Rattenborough here! I’m here now to help you learn
about how scientists sort, or **classify**, living things into
groups� Since I am an expert on animals, we will focus
mainly on animals�


First, I’m going to ask you two very important
questions� How do you know if something is living or
nonliving? What important **characteristics** do all living
things have?


  - All living things get energy from food�


  - All living things can have babies or make other
living things just like themselves�


  - All living things have a **life cycle**   - They start out
small and then grow�


  - The populations of all living things can change over
time based on which individuals in a population
survive and reproduce in their habitat�



9


_Humans have_ _**characteristics**_ _of living things._



10


Plants make up one group of living things� We know
this because plants have the same **characteristics** that all
living things have�


   - Plants get energy from food� They make their own
food using the sun, water, and gases in the air�


   - Plants make seeds that become new plants�


   - Plants grow from small seeds into seedlings and
become adult plants�


   - Plants are **adapted** to their **habitat**    - For example,
all plants need water, but a cactus doesn't need
as much water as other plants because they are
adapted to living in a dry desert�


11


_Plants have the_ _**characteristics**_ _that all living things have._



12


Animals of all shapes and sizes are living things, too�
So, animals also have the same **characteristics** that all
living things have�


   - Animals get energy from the food they eat�


   - Animals can have babies�


   - Baby animals are small but grow into adult animals�


   - Animals are **adapted** to their **habitat**   - For example,
polar bears have white fur because it blends in with
the snow where they live�


13


_Animals have the_ _**characteristics**_ _that all living things have._



14


Plants and animals are both living things, but
plants and animals are different in important ways� For
example, animals must eat other organisms for food, but
plants make their own food�


Scientists study how living things are alike and
different and sort, or **classify**, them into large groups
called **kingdoms**  - Most scientists currently organize
living things into five or six kingdoms� As they learn
more, this number could change� (You will learn about
the other **kingdoms** in later grades�) The living things
in each **kingdom** can then be sorted into more specific
groups�


Scientists study animals within the animal **kingdom**
and **classify** them by the **characteristics** they share with
other animals� One way scientists **classify** animals into
more specific groups is by checking if an animal has a
backbone� Insects do not have backbones, but birds and
fish do� So, animals with a backbone are in different,
more specific groups within the animal **kingdom**  - Insects
make up the largest group in the animal **kingdom**  - But
there are other large groups of animals, such as birds and
fish� You will learn more about other major groups in
future chapters�


15


**LIVING THINGS**


_Many scientists_ _**classify**_ _things into five_ _**kingdoms.**_
_They_ _**classify**_ _animals into other groups by their_ _**characteristics**_ _._


16


We **classify** the things around us so we can get to
know our world better� As we learn about living things,
we also learn about ourselves and our place in the world�


So far, scientists have **classified** over 1 million
different kinds of animals� Most of these are insects!
Many scientists think there may be close to 10 million
other animals that still have not been **classified** !


That’s all for now! Rattenborough, over and out!
I’ll be back in the next chapter to tell you more about
how animals are **classified** into different groups�


17


18


**Chapter**
### **Vertebrate or** **Invertebrate?**
# **3**

Rattenborough, here again! You have learned that
scientists who study the animal **kingdom** **classify**
animals into different groups, based on different
**characteristics**  - Some **characteristics** scientists study are:


   - what makes up the animal’s skin, such as hair
or **scales**


   - whether animals give birth to live babies or
lay eggs


   - whether mothers feed their babies milk from
their own bodies


   - whether animals are **warm-blooded** or
**cold-blooded**


19


_Scientists_ _**classify**_ _living things by different_ _**characteristics,**_ _such_
_as what is on their skin, if they lay eggs or have live babies, how_
_they feed their babies, and whether they are_ _**warm-blooded**_ _or_
_**cold-blooded**_ _._


20


Another key **characteristic** that scientists study
is whether animals have a backbone� Animals that
have a backbone are called **vertebrates**  - Humans are
**vertebrates**  - Place your hand on the back of your neck
until you feel a bump� Now, rub your hand up and down
the middle of your back� Do you feel bumpy bones that
run in a row down your back, from your neck down to
your waist? That’s your backbone� Another name for a
backbone is a **spine**  

The backbone or **spine** wraps around and protects an
important part of your body called the spinal cord� The
spinal cord is a bundle of nerves� Messages travel up and
down your spinal cord from your brain to other parts of
your body� This is the way that your brain sends signals
telling the other parts of your body what to do�


21


_Humans have a backbone and are classified as_ _**vertebrates**_ _._



22


Many other animals also are **vertebrates**   - All
**mammals**, **reptiles**, fish, and birds have a backbone, so
they are all **vertebrates**  - They have some type of spinal
cord, too�


Animals with a backbone come in all different
shapes and sizes� Apes, rhinos, horses, rabbits, bats—
and yes, rats and humans, too—are all **mammals** and
**vertebrates**  - Lizards, turtles, snakes, and crocodiles are
**reptiles** and **vertebrates**  - Huge sharks and tiny goldfish
are also **vertebrates**  - Small hummingbirds and large
eagles are **vertebrates**, too�


23


But there are many more animals that do not have
a backbone� Animals without a backbone are called
**invertebrates** - Insects are the largest group in the
animal **kingdom** - Insects are also the largest group
of **invertebrates** - Insects include flies, wasps, beetles,
cockroaches, ladybugs, and butterflies� Other kinds of
**invertebrates** include earthworms and spiders�


Some interesting **invertebrates** live in the sea�
Lobsters, shrimp, and crabs do not have a backbone� The
giant octopus is an **invertebrate** as well� Have you ever
seen a jellyfish or a starfish? They are also **invertebrates** So, these animals do not have a backbone or spinal cord�


24


**Chapter**
#### **[Warm-Blooded ]** **and Cold-Blooded** **Animals**
# **4**

Rattenborough, here again! In Chapter 2, you learned
how scientists **classify** living things into **kingdoms**  - You
learned about the animal and plant **kingdoms**  - You also
learned that animals and other living things are classified
into more specific groups�


Today, you will learn more about the animal
**kingdom** - You will learn that there are many kinds of
animals that have different **characteristics**  - Scientists
study these different **characteristics** to divide the animal
**kingdom** into more specific groups�


25


**LIVING THINGS**


_Scientists_ _**classify**_ _living things by different_ _**characteristics**_ _._
_They_ _**classify**_ _animals into other groups by their_ _**characteristics**_ _._


26


Many animals—such as cats, mice, rats, cows,
elephants, tigers, and even people—belong to a group
called **mammals**  - So, you and I are **mammals** ! All
**mammals** have hair, but some have more hair, or fur,
than others� You have to get pretty close to an elephant
to see its hair, but it is a **mammal**  

Another **characteristic** of **mammals** is that they give
birth to live babies� **Mammal** babies begin breathing,
moving, and looking for food as soon as they are born�
**Mammal** mothers make milk to feed their newborns�
This is another key **characteristic** of all **mammals**  

27


Do you think this crocodile is a **mammal** ?


Answer: No!


Why not?


  - Crocodiles have **scales**, not hair or fur�


  - Crocodiles lay eggs and baby crocodiles hatch from
those eggs�


  - A baby crocodile does not get milk from its mother�
Its first meal might be a bug� Later, he’ll eat bigger
animals�


Crocodiles belong to a different group of animals
called **reptiles**, along with snakes, lizards, and turtles�


28


Scientists also **classify** animals as **mammals** or
**reptiles** based on how the animals control their body
**temperature**  - All animals need to keep a **constant**
**temperature** inside their bodies for their bodies to work
properly� If an animal gets too hot or too cold, its body
will not work the way it should� An animal may become
sick or even die�


**Mammals** are **warm-blooded** animals� When **warm-**
**blooded** animals are in a cold place, they use energy
from food they eat to help keep their bodies warm� Some
**warm-blooded** animals shiver to keep warm� When
animals shiver, the process releases heat to keep their
bodies warm�


29


When **warm-blooded** animals are somewhere hot,
their bodies react in a different way to cool off� Some
**warm-blooded** animals, like people, sweat to stay cool�
Dogs pant to stay cool� Other **warm-blooded** animals
drink lots of water as a way to cool off� Did you know
that cows need to drink almost a bathtub full of water
a day?


**Warm-blooded** animals act in different ways
to maintain a **constant temperature** inside their
bodies� **Mammals** can live in **habitats** with different
**temperatures** because their bodies do not rely on the
environment� **Warm-blooded** animals, like **mammals**,
must eat often to get energy to heat or cool their bodies�
Most **warm-blooded** animals need to eat every day�
Some need to eat every hour!



30


**Reptiles** are **cold-blooded** animals� The body
**temperature** of **cold-blooded** animals changes
depending on the outside **temperature**  - They become
hot when it is hot outside and cold when it is cold
outside� But **cold-blooded** animals must also keep a
**constant temperature** for their bodies to work properly�


**Cold-blooded** animals do not use energy from their
bodies to stay warm or cool� Instead they use what is
around them to keep warm or keep cool� Crocodiles stay
in water or mud in order to stay cool on hot days� If they
need to warm up on cooler days, they bask in the sun�


While **warm-blooded** animals can live in just about
any **habitat**, **cold-blooded** animals can only live in
certain **habitats**  

**Cold-blooded** animals do not need to eat as often
as **warm-blooded** animals� This is because they do not
need lots of food to get energy to warm or cool their
bodies� Most crocodiles only eat once a week, but they
can live for months and sometimes years without eating!


31


_Cold-blooded animals like these crocodiles cool off by taking a swim_
_when it's too hot. When it's cool outside, they warm up in the sun._

**Chapter**

### **Fish**
# **5**

Rattenborough here again! You have learned that
scientists study the **characteristics** of animals� They do
this to divide the animal **kingdom** into different groups,
such as **mammals** and **reptiles**  - Today you are going to
learn about another group of animals within the animal
**kingdom** —fish�


Fish are **aquatic** animals, meaning that they spend
their lives **underwater**  - Most fish are **cold-blooded**  Their body **temperature** changes with the **temperature**
of the water� Fish are also **vertebrates**  - In fact, they
are the largest group of animals on Earth that are
**vertebrates**  - Earth is covered mostly by water, so it
makes sense that fish are the most common **vertebrates**  There are many different types and sizes of fish�


33


_Fish come in many sizes and colors._



34


Fish lay eggs **underwater**    - They also eat and
sleep under water� Fish do not sleep in the same way
**mammals** sleep� Fish can’t close their eyes because they
don’t have eyelids� When they sleep, they float around or
find a place to hide while they rest�


Like other animals, fish need to breathe **oxygen**    But fish do not have lungs like people, and they do not
breathe **oxygen** from the air� Instead, they have **gills**
just behind their heads� Fish **gills** take **oxygen** out of
the water, so that fish can breathe� But **gills** do not work
well outside water� They cannot take **oxygen** out of the
air� A fish will die quickly—within several minutes—if it
is removed from water�


Most fish have **scales** that cover their skin� **Scales**
are rounded and smooth, and there is usually an inner
and outer layer� The **scales** protect the skin and help fish
move easily through the water� Fish also use the different
**fins** on their body and their tails to swim� They are able
to glide through the water, rapidly changing direction by
using their **fins** and tail�


35


36


Most fish live in saltwater, because most water on
Earth is salty� Tropical fish that live in the warm ocean
are very colorful� They look as if an artist painted
interesting patterns on their bodies� Many fish also live
in freshwater, including streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds�


37


_These tropical fish live in a saltwater_ _**habitat**_ _._
38


Some fish travel in groups called **schools**    - One type
of fish that travels in **schools** is salmon� Salmon live in
both saltwater and freshwater� Some types of salmon are
born in freshwater streams and rivers� After about a year,
they make their way to the ocean where they live for one
to five years� Then, they **migrate** back to the exact same
stream where they were born� They lay eggs and the **life**
**cycle** begins again�


39


Salmon don’t use a map to help them find their way
back home� Most scientists think they use their strong
sense of smell to find their way� They swim upstream,
against the river’s current, sometimes swimming
hundreds of miles� They leap over waterfalls and rocks
to get to the same stream where they were born� They
go through all this hard work to reach their home to lay
their eggs�


Hopefully, along the way, a grizzly bear or fisherman
won’t catch them first� It just so happens that salmon are
among the tastiest of all fish!


40


**Chapter**
### **Fish:** **Fins and Gills**
# **6**


**Read-Aloud**

Hello everyone! I’m back after a delightful rest!
Today I’m going to tell you more about my friend Paolo
Piranha and the group to which he belongs� So far,
you’ve learned that scientists **classify** living things by
common **characteristics** in order to study them and
show relationships�


You have learned about **cold-blooded** and **warm-**
**blooded** animals� Who remembers if Paolo is **cold-**
**blooded** or **warm-blooded** and can explain what that
means? Ah, bravo! Right! Paolo Piranha’s internal body
**temperature** varies with his surroundings� When Paolo
is swimming in warm water, his body **temperature** is
higher than when he is swimming in cold water� His
body **temperature** is not **constant** ; it makes adjustments
to the surrounding **temperature** easily�


41


_Rainforest with Paolo_


Who remembers another way scientists **classify**
animals? I’ll give you a hint� It has to do with bones�
Right! Some animals have backbones—what’s another
word for animals with backbones? Yes, animals with
backbones are called **vertebrates** - And those without
backbones are called � � � Paolo is one of many kinds of
animals capable of swimming� Having a strong backbone
is one type of characteristic that helps Paolo and other
fish to be good swimmers�


42


You have also learned a little bit about taxonomy,
the science of **classification**  - Fish are members of
Animalia [an-uh-may-lee-uh], or the animal **kingdom**,
just like you and me, but they belong to a different
animal group� You are a **mammal** like Hilda Hippo and
myself, Ebenezer is a bird, and Paolo is a fish! Fish are
**vertebrates** and they are **cold-blooded**  - There are many
different types and sizes of fish, represented by many
species� Today I’m going to teach you a little more about
**aquatic** species of animals that are classified as fish�
So, to say that in three words: fish are **aquatic** ! They
don’t live on land� They live in water! All species of fish
are **aquatic**  

Fish make up the largest group of **vertebrates** on
Earth� Let’s take a look at my picture that shows a view
of planet Earth from space� There is a lot more water
than land� Nearly three quarters of the earth’s surface
is covered by water� Fish are swimming about in the
earth’s waters—from ponds and streams to rivers, lakes,
and oceans� They have **adapted** to almost every water
**habitat** on Earth except for some very hot springs and
the extremely salty Dead Sea� Aside from these places,
fish can live anywhere! It’s no wonder that fish make up
the largest group of **vertebrates** on Earth�


43


Most of those wet, watery fish **habitats** are salty
because most of the earth’s water is salt water� If you ever
swim in the ocean, you may get a little taste of the salty
sea� Sharks, cod, and flounder are all saltwater fish�


Freshwater fish live in lakes, rivers, streams, and
ponds� What do you think fresh water is? Bass and trout
are common freshwater fish, and some humans actually
find them very tasty� Come to think of it—I find fish
quite delicious when I can get my paws on fish scraps!


Some fish, such as salmon, spend part of their lives in
freshwater rivers and part in the salty seawater� Salmon
begin their lives in rivers where they stay for anywhere
from six months to three years, depending on the species�
Then they make an often-dangerous journey out to sea,
facing **predators** and changing water **temperatures**
along the way� They live in the saltwater ocean for about
four years before returning to the freshwater rivers to
lay their eggs� Their migration often covers several
hundred miles�


45


Let’s stop for a moment to think about the different
ways that taxonomists **classify** Paolo, a South American
piranha from the Amazon River� He’s a **cold-blooded**,
**aquatic** **vertebrate** - He’s a fish to be sure� The question
is whether he is a saltwater fish or a freshwater fish�
Which of these types of water is his home? That’s right!
A freshwater river� Paolo’s home is the Amazon River,
one of the largest rivers in the world� Piranhas live in
freshwater environments, mostly rivers, so they are
classified as freshwater fish�


_Red-Bellied Piranha_



46


Sometimes animals are classified by their physical
**characteristics**  - Though piranhas do have very sharp
teeth, they are not the bloodthirsty **carnivores** they
are sometimes perceived to be, always ready to attack
humans� Indeed, members of the red-bellied species of
piranha do hunt the meat of other fish in large groups,
but that’s not all they eat� Most piranhas are **omnivores**  You have reviewed **carnivores** and **omnivores** earlier
in this Reader� Who can tell me what the difference is?
That’s right—as **omnivores**, most piranhas eat both
animals and plants, eating seeds and fruit that fall into
the water� Many piranhas also feed on carrion, animals
that have already died� You will continue to hear about
the different foods that many different animals eat—this
will help you describe animals� Later you will hear about
how the shape and size of animals’ teeth give you clues
about what they eat�


So, you already know several common
**characteristics** of fish� But there are more� Can you
think of any others? I’ll give you a hint� You know that
all animals need to breathe **oxygen** in order to live� Fish
do not have **lungs**, so we have to wonder how in the
world—or in this case under water—do they breathe?


47


Look closely at this fish and see if you can spot its
breathing machine� The **respiratory**, or breathing,
organs of a fish are called **gills** - All fish have **gills** - They
take water in through their mouths and the water passes
over their **gills** - The **gills** take in **oxygen** from the water,
allowing them to breathe� You will die quickly if you
don’t get enough air because you draw **oxygen** out of the
air� But fish will die quickly if they do not have water,
because their **oxygen** comes from water�


48


The African lungfish is the only fish I know that
has lungs in addition to **gills** and can **survive** out of the
water� We call this an exception to the rule, or a “patternbreaker�” Before the dry season, when the water dries
up and leaves a sun-baked riverbed behind, the lungfish
buries itself deep in the mud and builds a cocoon-like
sheath around itself, staying there for a year or more
until water returns to the river� Okay then, fish breathe
with **gills**, and you breathe with lungs� That’s one big
difference between you and fish� What’s another?


Think about how you swim—with your arms and
legs, of course! Take a close look at the fish� Do you see
any arms and legs? Nope! So, what helps a fish move
through the water? Yes, a fish has **fins** —all kinds of **fins!**
It has **fins** on the sides of its body for steering, **fins** at the
back for powerful speed, and **fins** at the top and bottom
to help keep balance� Fish couldn’t begin to move
without those wonderfully flat **fins** and their flexible
tails� Have you ever worn flippers? Flippers are designed
to be like fish tails to help people move more quickly
through the water�


49


_Fish scales_


Well, everybody, you’ve spotted the **gills** and **fins**
of a fish, but what about the rest of a fish’s body—what
about the skin? Hey! Look at me! There I am, taking a
close look at fish skin through my magnifying glass� Fish
skin is very different from your skin� Most fish have scaly
skin to help protect them and help them move more
easily through the water� These hard overlapping **scales**
are rounded and smooth� And fish have more than on
layer of skin—just like you!


50


Many scientists think that fish appeared in the oceans
more than 400 million years ago� It’s hard to imagine
how many fish live in all of the earth’s waters today�
More than thirty thousand species are known, but a vast
amount of the world’s oceans have yet to be explored�
What scientists actually know for certain is like one drop
of water in a vast bucket! Scientists discover more and
more all the time� Maybe one day you will be one of
those scientists who will discover something new!


Most fish—such as salmon, goldfish, tuna, and
eel— **spawn**, or reproduce, in a very unique way� When
fish spawn, the mother releases her eggs into the water
and the male **fertilizes** them, or makes them complete
and able to grow into baby fish� Once these soft eggs are
fertilized, they are often buried along the river bottom�
Here, they develop and eventually hatch into tiny fish
called larvae [lahr-vee], the early form of fish� Some
sharks, on the other hand, are among the few examples
of live-bearing fish� Almost the opposite of external
spawning, the mother shark’s eggs develop internally,
remaining inside her body until they are born as live
young, rather than as eggs�


51


_Fish eggs and shark mother with baby_



52


Taxonomists have another way of grouping fish� They
have divided all fish into three classes, or classifications�
Most fish belong to the class called bony fish� These fish
have skeletons that are made of hard, bony material�
Most of them have a swim bladder, kind of like an
internal “floatie,” which helps them float� Perhaps you
know of some fish that are considered bony fish—bass,
clownfish, minnows, and sunfish are just a few! Another
smaller class has some well-known members� As you
have heard earlier, fish like the shark and the stingray
have skeletons made of cartilage� This class of fish has
tooth-like **scales**, and some of them breathe through
spiracles—small **gill** openings on the tops of their
heads! The last class of fish is not as familiar to most of
us—these fish are jawless and include some interesting
members like the hagfish and the lamprey�


Earth’s underwater world—Paolo’s world—is a
fascinating place, much of which has not yet been
explored� Perhaps some of you will become scientists
and study **aquatic** creatures like Paolo� Today, we’ve
only talked about fish, but not all sea animals are fish�
There are many other **vertebrates** in the ocean, such
as dolphins, sea snakes, and sea turtles� The sea is also
home to tens of thousands of species of **invertebrates** animals you may have seen before, such as crabs, clams,
sand dollars, and squid�

54


Let’s review the **characteristics** of fish� How many
fish **characteristics** can you name? Great job! Now, I’m
going to read you some riddles of sea creatures� See if
you can identify which ones are fish and which ones
are not�


1� I am a jellyfish� My soft body has no bones, and I
have neither **gills** nor lungs for breathing� **Oxygen**
moves easily through my thin skin� Sometimes I
lay eggs, but I may also give live birth� I am **cold-**
**blooded** and will surely die if left out of water�
(No, I am not a fish, even though the word is in
my name; I am classified as an **invertebrate** �)


2� I am a **cold-blooded** eel� My slimy, snakelike
body is covered in **scales** and hides my backbone
from view� I have **gills** and **fins**, and I lay my eggs
in the water where I live� (Yes, I am a fish�)


55


3� I am a sea horse� My long body is encased in
bony rings� I breathe with **gills**, and my **fins** help
me glide through the water� I am the male, and
I carry eggs in my pouch until they are ready to
hatch� (Yes, I am a fish�)


4� I am a whale, one of the largest animals of the sea�
I breathe with lungs and give birth to live babies�
Even though I am not covered in hair, I do have
a few bristles of hair here and there on my head�
(No, I am not a fish, but I am a **vertebrate**    - I am a
**mammal** �)


Sorting **aquatic** creatures is not as easy as it looks, is
it? Next time, things will be even more interesting as we
learn about some **aquatic** animals that can live on land
as well� How do you think they can do that? You will
find out more the next time we meet!

**Chapter**

### **Amphibians**
# **7**

Greetings once again from your pal and animal
expert, Rattenborough! Are you ready to learn about
another group of animals within the animal **kingdom** ?
The group we are going to talk about today is really
interesting� They live both in water and on land� This
group of animals is called **amphibians**  - The word
**amphibian** comes from Latin meaning “both sides
of life�”


**Amphibians** are classified into three more
specific groups� Frogs and toads are the largest group�
Salamanders and newts make up another� Animals in
the third group do not have legs, so they look more like
large snakes� We don’t know as much about this group of
**amphibians** because they live mostly underground�


57


To understand the **life cycle** of an **amphibian**, let’s
take a closer look at an American toad�


Like all **amphibians**, toads are **cold-blooded**   - An
**amphibian’s** body **temperature** changes as the outdoor
**temperature** changes� Some **amphibians** **hibernate**
during the winter� Some toads dig deep underground�
Other **amphibians** like frogs bury themselves in mud
at the bottom of a pond� **Hibernating amphibians** can
**survive** for months� They do not eat or move, using
only the fat stored in their body to stay alive� Frogs and
toads—and all **amphibians** —are also **vertebrates** 


58


A toad’s **life cycle** begins as one of thousands of soft,
slimy eggs� The mother lays her eggs close to shore in a
pond, lake, or calm spot in a river or stream�


But most of these eggs will never hatch� Instead, they
will be eaten by fish or other animals� If the water moves
the eggs away from the shore and into direct sunlight,
the eggs will dry out and die�


Out of the thousands of eggs laid, a few hundred
toad eggs manage to hatch into **tadpoles**  - A **tadpole**
is very fragile� Its young body is made up mainly of
a mouth, a tail, and **gills**  - At this stage, **tadpoles** are
**aquatic**  - Like fish, they use **gills** to breathe underwater�


59


_The_ _**life cycle**_ _of a frog or toad_



60


After a while, **tadpoles** begin swimming around
and eating tiny **aquatic** plants� **Tadpoles** tend to stay
together in **schools**, like fish� However, this makes it
more likely that other animals will be able to catch and
eat them� Most **tadpoles** end up as fish snacks�


If a **tadpole** **survives** for a month, skin will begin
to grow over its **gills**  - After about six to nine weeks,
the **tadpole** also starts to grow little legs� As its body
changes, the young frog or toad starts to look less like an
**aquatic** animal and more like a land animal�


After a few months, a toad will make its way out
of the water to land� At this stage, it may still have
a tail, but that won’t last long� By this time, its **gills**
have become lungs� That means the toad now breathes
**oxygen** from the air instead of **oxygen** from the water,
like fish� Soon, it will be a full-grown adult toad living
and hopping around on land� Adult **amphibians** are
**carnivores**, eating insects, small **reptiles**, and even mice�


61

_Top: The_ _**life cycle**_ _of a frog or toad_



62


Adult toads are very good swimmers and can even
swim underwater� But they cannot use their lungs to
breathe underwater� Instead, their thin, moist skin
absorbs **oxygen** from the water�


**Amphibians** are a very interesting animal group�
**Amphibians** are the only type of animal that have both
**gills** and lungs� As adults, they live on land but lay eggs
in the water� The Latin meaning of the word **amphibian**
makes perfect sense!

### **Tree Frogs**
# **8**

As you have learned, **amphibians** are **vertebrates**
that spend part of their lives in water and part of their
lives on land� They start out like fish because they are
born with **gills** and can breathe underwater� They later
develop lungs, so they can breathe air and live on land�
Tree frogs are one type of **amphibian**  - They are different
from most **amphibians** because they spend most of their
lives in trees�


The American green tree frog can be found in
most parts of the southeastern United States� A typical
American tree frog is only about two inches long, so they
are pretty small� But they can be loud if there are a few
hundred of them gathered together�


65


_An American green tree frog_



66


If you live in the southern United States, near water
and lots of trees, your summer nights may be filled with
the gentle chirps of tree frogs�


American tree frogs range in color from lime green
to yellow� A tree frog’s most distinct **characteristic** is its
long toes with **suction cups**  - The **suction cups** allow a
tree frog to cling to and climb anything� A tree frog can
even stick to a window�


Tree frogs like to stay in the trees, so you are more
likely to hear them instead of see them� They will leave
the trees to lay eggs� They are most likely to come down
to the ground after a heavy rain, when everything is nice
and wet�


67


_This tree frog's long toes with_ _**suction cups**_ _help it climb this_
_branch._



68


If you do see one, don’t worry! They are pretty
friendly� They are easy to catch, too� If you catch one, it
might sit on your hand or crawl around on your back�


You will probably only find them at night because
they are **nocturnal**  - This means they sleep during the day
and are active at night� They eat small insects, such as
crickets, moths, and other **nocturnal** insects�


Like other **amphibians**, American green tree frogs
lay their eggs in or near the water� Most of them like
to lay their eggs very close to water, but not quite in it�
Their favorite place is on a tree limb or leafy branch that
has fallen into a pond�


69


_The American green tree frog is_ _**nocturnal**_ _._



70


Different kinds of tree frogs have been around since
long before the dinosaurs roamed the earth� You can
find many different types of tree frogs in parts of North
and South America, Europe, and Southeast Asia� This is
a red-eyed tree frog, which you can find in Mexico and
much of Central America�


Most tree frogs prefer a fairly warm, wet **climate**    If you live in a place with tree frogs, consider yourself
lucky� In the summer, you can fall asleep each night
listening to the steady song of a tree frog **orchestra**  

71


_This type of tree frog lives in Mexico and Central America._

**Chapter**
### **The Poison** **Dart Frog**
# **9**

A poison dart frog lives in the rainforests of South
America� It is a tiny frog� It is only an inch and a
half long�


It is cute, but it would be a mistake to pet this frog�
Frogs like this one **secrete** poison� That means the
poison seeps out from its skin� Some poison dart frogs
secrete a mild poison� Others secrete a poison that is
strong enough to kill humans� The poison helps protect
the frog� It tells other animals to leave the frog alone�


The native people of South America collected poison
from this kind of frog� They dipped darts into the
poison� Then, they used blow guns to fire poisoned darts
at their enemies� This is why the frogs are called poison
dart frogs�


73


Many poison dart frogs are brightly colored� You
might think this would be a dangerous trait� After all,
many animals are camouflaged� Their camouflage helps
them hide from **predators** - Why, then, would an animal
be brightly colored? Why would it stand out? Wouldn’t
that make it easy for **predators** to spot?


_Sapphire blue species of poison dart frog._




Scientists think that is precisely the point� They have
noted that many **poisonous** animals are brightly colored�
They think the color serves as a warning sign� It tells
other animals, “Watch out! You don’t want to eat me! I
will poison you!”


Poison dart frogs are **amphibians**    - That means they
live in water and on land�


Poison dart frogs lay eggs� The female lays the eggs
in a moist spot� Then, the male fertilizes the eggs�
Eventually, **tadpoles** hatch out of the fertilized eggs�
Some **amphibians**
lay a lot of eggs and
leave the young to
fend for themselves�
Poison dart frogs are
not like that� They
are dedicated parents�
The adult frogs carry
their newly hatched
**tadpoles** up into
the canopy, or tops,
of trees above the
rainforest� They carry
the baby **tadpoles**

_Poison dart frog._

75


_Poison dart frogs have brightly colored skin that gives off the_
_warning to_ _**predators**_ _of their toxicity._


on their backs, one at a time� The parents secrete sticky
mucus� This sticky mucus keeps the **tadpoles** from
falling off the parents’ backs during the climb up to
the canopy�



76


For many species, the mothers do much of the
childcare� This is not true of poison dart frogs� Mothers
and fathers both take care of the young� Moms and dads
both carry the **tadpoles** up into the canopy�


The parents deposit the **tadpoles** in small pools of
water that form in plants at the top of the canopy� The
**tadpoles** live in these pools for a while� They breathe
underwater, using **gills**  - They eat tiny animals that live in
the water� If there is not enough food, the mother may
lay eggs in the pool� The **tadpoles** can eat the eggs�


Eventually, the **tadpoles** experience a metamorphosis,
or change� They grow legs� They develop lungs� They
change into frogs� Once this happens, they are ready to
leave the water�


The **habitat** of the poison dart frog is under threat�
It is threatened by logging and farming� If trees are cut
down, these frogs have nowhere to live� In recent years,
lots of trees have been cut down in South America� Some
people cut them down to sell the wood� Some cut them
down to set up farms� As a result of this tree cutting,
some kinds of poison dart frogs are now endangered�

### **[Reptiles: Cold-]** **Blooded Scaly** **Vertebrates**
# **10**


**Read-Aloud**

Hello, boys and girls� As you can see, Anna Anaconda
is our starting place for today’s lesson� She is a green
anaconda, one of the largest snakes in the world� When
she unwinds, she is about as long as six of you stretched
head-to-toe across the room, and she weighs about five
hundred pounds! That’s more than about eight of you
put together!


Anna Anaconda belongs to a group of animals
that shares a lot of the same **characteristics** as the
**amphibians** you learned about last time� Who knows
the name of the group used by taxonomists to **classify**
snakes? Yes, snakes are **reptiles**  - **Reptiles** include
crocodiles, alligators, lizards, turtles, and tortoises� But
right now I want to focus on one **reptile** only: Anna� It’s
no secret that she has a very high opinion of herself—she
was quite fond of telling me so when I visited Peru� She
thinks she is rather pretty, and I quite agree!


79


_Rainforest with piranha, toad, and Anna Anaconda_


In spite of her heavy body, Anna is a very good
swimmer� Unlike some of her reptilian relatives, she is an
**aquatic** snake, preferring swamps and rivers to the land�


Snakes often have a bad reputation� Some snakes
are **venomous**, injecting a harmful liquid called **venom**
when they bite� Anna’s teeth are actually quite small
and she is not **venomous**, so you need not worry about
that� However, some people fear anacondas because they
are members of a family of snakes called constrictors�
Does anyone know what that means? Constrictors catch
and kill their prey by coiling, or wrapping, around and
squeezing them very tightly� Anacondas’ jaws open



80


so wide that they can swallow animals whole—fish,
caiman, even jaguars and small deer� The anaconda’s
powerful muscles crush the bones of its prey as it
constricts� Once swallowed, the anaconda slowly digests
its meal�


Uh oh, some of you look fearful� Don’t worry� You’re
safe� Anacondas don’t live where you live in North
America; you’ll find them far, far away on the continent of
South America� That’s where I met Anna! Anna was sure
to tell me that as far as she knows, there is no documented
record of an anaconda ever killing a man, woman, or child�
She and all anacondas are **nocturnal** animals and they
hunt at night, eating frogs, toads, birds, fish, and turtles�
She doesn’t have to hunt very often because one animal will
satisfy her appetite for a long time�


Well, that’s a lot of information about Anna’s
**characteristics**, the ways by which scientists **classify**
her as belonging to the animal class called **reptiles**, or
reptilia� Anna and other **reptiles** share some common
**characteristics** with **amphibians**  - **Reptiles** are all
**vertebrates** because they all have backbones, and they
are all **cold-blooded** because their internal **temperatures**
change with their surroundings� Most **reptiles** can adjust
their body **temperatures** by basking in the sun to stay
warm, or by hiding under a rock to stay cool�


81


Just like **amphibians**, **reptiles** live on land and in
water� However, these two groups do—of course—have
their differences� **Amphibians** depend upon water to
stay alive much more so than **reptiles** - **Amphibians** ’
thin, wet, slimy skin needs moisture to absorb **oxygen**
from the air, but **reptiles** ’ skin is waterproof� Unlike
toads and salamanders, Anna and other **reptiles** do
not breathe through their skin, which is hard, dry, and
scaly� They use only their lungs to breathe air, which
means they are able to withstand very harsh dry weather,
conditions under which **amphibians** would not be able
to **survive** - Of course, because they have lungs, this also
means that **reptiles** cannot stay underwater very long
without coming to the surface to breathe�


**Amphibians** usually spend part of their lives entirely
in water, but this is not true of **reptiles** as a group�
Whereas **amphibians** begin life with **gills**, **reptiles** are
born with lungs and are never dependent upon **gills** for
breathing� Remember how different baby **tadpoles** look
from adult toads? This is not the case for **reptiles** - Baby
**reptiles** usually look a lot like their parents� They do not
undergo metamorphosis the way that **amphibians** do�


82


_From top left going clockwise: gecko, iguana, gecko, chameleon._
_Bottom: Komodo dragon_



83


Let’s take a look at some of the animals that belong
to the animal group classified as **reptiles** - These include
lizards, geckos, iguanas, and chameleons� Unlike snakes,
most lizards have four legs� Chameleons have a keen
sense of sight and very long tongues� Their brilliant
colors—all shades of pink, blue, red, orange, turquoise,
and green—help them camouflage when they come faceto-face with their enemies�


Earth’s largest living lizard is the Komodo dragon� It
can grow to be ten feet long and may weigh as much as
150 pounds! These giant island **carnivores** eat animals as
large as goats, pigs, and deer�


Saltwater crocodiles are the largest **reptiles** on Earth,
some weighing up to one ton� Looking like very large
lizards, crocodiles make their homes in tropical **climates**,
and are often seen floating like logs in the water with
only their nostrils, eyes, and ears showing� Like Anna,
they are **nocturnal** hunters, hunting at night� Crocodiles
have the most powerful bite in the entire animal
**kingdom** and are fierce hunters, living off fish and small
**mammals** - Some live to be more than one hundred
years old!


84


_Alligator and crocodile_


85


Alligators resemble crocodiles, but they are usually
less **aggressive**, or boldly forceful, and live in freshwater
**habitats** - Can you tell the difference between an alligator
and a crocodile? Alligators usually have a wide, rounded,
U-shaped snout, and crocodiles tend to have longer,
more pointed, V-shaped noses�


86


Look at all of these **reptiles** side by side: chameleons,
Komodo dragons, crocodiles, and alligators� What do
you notice about their skin? Is it rough or smooth? Does
it look thick or thin?


Remember when I mentioned that **reptiles** ’ skin is
waterproof, and that it is hard, thick, and scaly? Their
type of scaly skin protects them from overheating, and
because their skin is waterproof, it keeps water inside
their bodies� Because **reptiles** ’ skin is very **sensitive**
to—or easily affected by— **temperature**, it becomes hot
or cold very quickly when exposed to sun or shade� Like
many **amphibians**, some **reptiles** shed their skin� Many
lizards and snakes shed their skin several times a year
as they grow� Snakes do not eat their shed skin the way
**amphibians** do�


Turtles and tortoises are the only **reptiles** with bony
shells as part of their skeletons� Their backbones are
actually fused to their shells� These shells may be flat or
domed� Turtles have softer shells so that they can swim
faster, but land-dwelling tortoises need hard, leathery
shells to protect them from **predators**  - Their legs vary
in appearance, depending upon where they live as well�
Sea turtles have oar-shaped flippers for moving through
water **effectively**  - Many turtles have claws which help
them dig, and pond turtles also have webs between


87


_**Reptile**_ _scales_
88


_Frog and snake eggs_


their claws to effectively maneuver, or move, through
water� Land tortoises—like the giant Galapagos—have
huge, column-shaped legs with claws� These claws help
them dig into the ground to move across it� Some turtle
species live for more than a century! That’s a very long
time indeed�


Body coverings are an important difference between
**amphibians** and **reptiles** - Another thing that sets
the two groups apart is their eggs� Remember the
picture that showed strands of thousands of soft eggs
that Tabitha Toad laid in the pond? Most **reptiles**



89


lay far fewer eggs, and they lay their eggs in nests on
land� **Membranes**, soft outer coverings, that provide
protection and also help to hold in necessary water for
eggs to grow, usually coat the inside of reptilian eggs�
In most **reptile** species, the eggs are also covered in
leathery, **calcified** shells� A few snakes and lizards give
birth to fully formed, live young instead of laying eggs�
The garter snake, a snake that is right here in North
America, is one of these exceptions to the rule; so is the
Solomon Island Skink, a lizard whose **ecosystem** is near
the continent of Australia�


Like **amphibians**, **reptiles** live all over the world�
They prefer hot, low areas like rainforests, prairies,
deserts, and oceans, but they can be found everywhere
except near the cold South Pole�


If you are as fascinated as I am with **reptiles** and
**amphibians**, you may want to think about becoming
a herpetologist� Yes, indeed—herpetologist is the name
given to a scientist who specializes in herpetology, the
study of certain crawling animals, specifically, **reptiles**
and **amphibians** - With more than 5,600 species of
lizards alone, that should keep you busy for a lifetime!

# **11**


### **Reptiles**



Hi again, it’s Rattenborough! You have already
learned a little about today’s group of animals, which
are **reptiles**  - You already know that **reptiles** are **cold-**
**blooded** animals and **vertebrates** - But did you know
that **reptiles** live both on land and in water like
**amphibians** ? **Reptiles** have lungs from the time they are
born, not **gills**, like **amphibians**  

You may also already know that **reptiles** lay eggs�
Some **reptile** eggs have soft shells and some have hard
shells� They lay their eggs on land� A few snakes hold
the eggs inside their bodies until they hatch� Very few
rare **reptiles** do give birth to live young, never making
real eggs�


Many different groups of animals are classified as
**reptiles**  - These include animals such as crocodiles,
alligators, turtles, tortoises, snakes, and lizards�


91


_Crocodiles, turtles, snakes, and lizards are all_ _**reptiles**_ _._



92


Some people may think **reptiles**, mainly snakes, are
scary� Most **reptiles** will not harm people� But there are
some **reptiles** that you should try to avoid� The black
mamba is the best example� This is the longest and most
**venomous** snake in Africa� It is also the deadliest snake
in the world� A mamba **injects** **venom** whenever it bites
something� A mamba bite can kill any animal—even a
human—in less than 20 minutes!


Rattlesnakes, copperheads, and water moccasins are
types of **venomous** snakes found in the United States�
Rattlesnakes, or rattlers, are easy to spot because they
have “rattles” that shake on their tails� You know when
there is one nearby because you can hear the rattles
shaking�


Copperheads have a triangle-shaped head and dark
stripes� They are normally less than three feet long� They
prefer to live in rocky, wooded areas� They only bite
humans if they are attacked or startled�


Water moccasins live in the water so they are hard
to spot� They have a dangerous bite, but rarely attack
humans� If you live in a southern state like Florida,
Alabama, Mississippi, or Louisiana, you are more likely


93


to see one� They live in swamps or shallow lakes� You
might want to avoid swimming in shallow waters if you
live in those states�


Some people think snakes are slimy because their
skin looks shiny, but most **reptiles** have thick, dry, scaly
skin� **Reptiles** are known for **molting**, or shedding
their skin� **Reptiles** shed their skin several times during
their lives� Snakes, for example, shed their skin in one
big piece� They do this when they grow too big for their
current skin�


The biggest **reptile** is the saltwater crocodile, which
lives mainly in Australia and a few parts of India and
Asia� Male saltwater crocodiles can grow to be 20 feet
long or more! Attacks on humans are rare�


Crocodiles have the most powerful bite in the entire
animal **kingdom**  - Their bites are ten times stronger than
that of a great white shark� Despite their power when
they bite and snap their jaws shut, it is fairly easy to hold
a crocodile’s mouth closed� They open their mouths
using a weak set of muscles�

### **Birds**



Yoo hoo—over here! It’s Rattenborough! So far, you
have learned about the following groups of animals
within the animal **kingdom** : **mammals**, **reptiles**, fish,
and **amphibians**  - Do you remember all of their different
**characteristics** ? Do you remember that we said that
fish were the largest group of **vertebrates** in the animal
**kingdom** ? Well, today we are going to talk about the
second largest group of **vertebrates** —birds�


Birds belong to a group all their own� Birds, like
all living things, are highly adaptive, meaning they can
**survive** in many different **ecosystems**  - You can find
them in deserts and in the coldest places on Earth� Many
love forests� There are only a few birds found way out to
sea, many miles from land� But if you are out in a boat
only a few miles from land, you may see many sea birds,
such as seagulls�


97


_Different kinds of birds live in many different_ _**ecosystems**_ _._



98


Like **mammals**, birds are **warm-blooded**   - Many
birds **migrate** when the seasons change� In late fall, they
fly in groups called **flocks** from colder places to warmer
places� Then, in the spring after winter is over, they
**migrate** back to the place where they were in the fall�
Birds are the only animal besides some insects and bats
that are able to fly�


All birds have wings, but not all birds are able to
fly� Penguins are probably the best known birds that do
not fly� Penguins make up for not flying by being great
swimmers� Ostriches, the largest of all birds, can’t fly
either, but they sure can run very fast! They also lay the
world’s largest eggs�


Besides wings, all birds have two legs and a mouth
without teeth, called a beak� A key **characteristic** of
birds is that they all have **feathers**  - **Feathers** help these
**warm-blooded** animals fly and help them maintain
a **constant** body **temperature**  - Bird **feathers** come in
all kinds of colors and sizes� A bird’s **feathers** are also
called **plumage**  - Peacocks have the fanciest **plumage**
of all� They like to show off by fanning their long,
colorful **feathers**  

99


_All birds have wings and_ _**feathers**_ _, but not all birds can fly._



100


Most birds are nesting animals� Many birds make their
own nest, often high up in the trees or in thick bushes�
They use bits and pieces of nature, such as twigs and parts
of plants, to create their nest� Other birds build their nests
in tree holes� Some bird nests are made of mud�


Most birds lay eggs in their nests� Some lay a bunch
of eggs and some lay only one or two� The nest needs
to be in a safe place to protect the little eggs from the
weather and other animals that might eat the eggs� Birds
sit on their eggs to keep them warm and safe until the
eggs hatch� Once they hatch, the baby birds need to eat�
Mother and father birds fly out from the nest and find
food for their babies� They fly back to the nest and place
the food in each baby’s beak�


Many birds are **omnivores**   - Some birds eat seeds
and berries� Some eat insects� Some, like the great blue
heron, eat fish� Hawks eat little **mammals**  - Other birds,
like tiny hummingbirds, eat **nectar** from flowers� All
birds drink water�


Birds are also known for their songs� Their songs are
used to **attract** mates and to claim a place as their own�
Sometimes it seems as if they sing because they want to�
Maybe they sing just to remind us how beautiful and
interesting the animal **kingdom** is!

### **Mammals**



Aha! Now we get to an animal group that I really
know a lot about! I, Rattenborough, am part of this
group of animals myself! I’m talking about **mammals**  Do you remember the **characteristics** that scientists use
to identify **mammals** ? Hair is one major **characteristic**  Live birth and giving milk to their young are others�
They breathe **oxygen** from the air using their lungs�
**Mammals** are also **warm-blooded**, and they are
**vertebrates**  

Most scientists agree that **mammals** are the
smartest creatures in the animal **kingdom**  - All animals
**communicate** in some way� Dogs **communicate** by
barking and wagging their tails� Cows moo� Some
cats meow, others roar� But **mammals** seem to use the
most complex forms of **communication**  - Humans use
**language** to talk� They also **communicate** with their
faces and hands� Some apes and chimpanzees have even
been taught to use sign **language** to **communicate**  

103


_**Mammals**_ _**communicate**_ _in different ways._



104


There are two other **mammals** that also seem to use
an advanced form of **communication**  - In fact, you may
not even realize that these animals are **mammals** because
they live in the ocean� Dolphins and whales are classified
as **aquatic** **mammals**  - Dolphins and whales, like other
**mammals**, do not have **gills** like fish, so they cannot
breathe underwater� Instead, they use blowholes at the
top of their heads to blow out water and suck in air�
Dolphins and whales rise to the surface of the water and
poke their heads into the air to breathe�


Whales and dolphins **communicate** by sending out
sound waves through the water� They use these sound
waves to help them find their way through the ocean�
The sound waves bounce off objects and echo back to
the whale or dolphin in a process called **sonar**  - Using
sonar, the whale or dolphin can tell the size, shape, and
speed of objects, and the distance away from them based
on the time it takes the echo sound to travel back to
them�


105


_You might think dolphins would be classified as fish, but they are_
_classified as_ _**mammals**_ _._


106


Dolphins and whales also give birth to live young�
No eggs needed! They even feed milk to their young� If
you study them closely, you will learn that dolphins and
whales have hair, not **scales**  - They also have very thick
skin� Their skin protects them from the cold and animals
that are their **predators**  

You might also be surprised to learn that bats are also
**mammals** - Bats fly like birds, but they do not have the
other **characteristics** that birds have� Bats have fur, not
**feathers**  - Their arms have wing-like flaps of skin, but
they are not like bird wings� Bats also give birth to live
young and they produce milk� So, scientists **classify** bats
as **mammals**  

107


_Bats are also_ _**mammals**_ _._



108
108


Here’s an interesting fact: not all **mammals** give
birth to live young� The duck-billed platypus and spiny
anteater both lay eggs like birds and some **reptiles**, but
have all the other **characteristics** of **mammals**  - Good
luck finding one� They are very rare!


**Mammals** have their fair share of odd members, like
the duck-billed platypus� But the basic **characteristics**  hair, backbone, milk, **warm-blooded** —are always
present in **mammals** no matter what�

### **Jane Goodall**
# **14**

Jane Goodall is a very famous **primatologist**   - She
is a scientist who studies a group of **mammals** called
**primates**  - **Primates** are a group of **mammals** that
includes humans, monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees�
Jane Goodall has spent her whole life studying
chimpanzees� She has focused on studying animal
**behavior** in chimpanzees� Her discoveries have made her
one of the best known scientists in the world�


Goodall was born in 1934 in London, England�
When she was a little girl, her father gave her a toy
chimpanzee� It looked so real that people who visited her
house were afraid of it, but she loved it!


When Goodall was 23, she went to Africa� She began
studying chimpanzees with a well-known scientist named
Louis Leakey� After a year of working in Africa, Goodall
went back to England and studied at the University of
Cambridge� Can you guess what her favorite subject was?
Chimpanzees!


111


_Jane Goodall_



112


After finishing **school**, Goodall returned to Africa
and spent the next 45 years studying chimpanzees in
the wild� Her discoveries during those years completely
changed the way people think about **primates**  

Before Goodall’s work, people thought chimpanzees
were **herbivores**  - She discovered that they eat meat, too�
More importantly, Goodall discovered that chimps were
quite **intelligent**  - She **observed** them making and using
tools! Before that, people thought humans were the only
animals that made and used tools�


When you hear the word tool, you may think of a
hammer, saw, or shovel� Chimps don’t use those kinds of
tools� A tool is something used to help make a job easier�
Tools can be very simple� A rock becomes a tool if you
pick it up and use it to crack open a walnut�


113


_Goodall studies chimpanzees, a type of_ _**mammal**_ _belonging to_
_the_ _**primate**_ _group._



114


Goodall **observed** chimps using blades of grass
and sticks as tools� Chimps like to eat termites, a type
of insect that is like an ant� Termites live in holes
underground� To catch these tasty insects, Goodall
**observed** a chimp sticking a blade of grass into a termite
hole� The termites crawled onto the grass� Then, the
chimp took the grass out of the hole and ate all the
termites� Before Goodall wrote about this **behavior**,
people did not realize how clever chimps and other
**primates** are�


Goodall gave names to all the chimps in the group
she was studying� She got to know them pretty well�
Over time, she learned that chimps were smart animals�
She learned that chimps express many of the same
feelings as people� They can feel happy, sad, and mad�
Chimps can also be mean� Goodall saw them attack and
eat small monkeys, not out of hunger, but because they
didn’t want them around�


115


_A chimpanzee uses a plant stem as a tool._



116


Goodall is more than a scientist� She is also an
**activist**  - An **activist** is someone who works hard to solve
a problem and change something in the world� Goodall
works as an animal rights **activist** to protect chimpanzees
and their **habitats**  - She tells others about human damage
to **habitats**, such as hunting and pollution, and works
to stop these problems� She loves working with young
people and teaching them how to protect animals� She
has written many books and has been the subject of
books and movies� She has won many awards for her
work in protecting chimpanzees� As of 2015, she was
81 years old and still working to spread the message that
animals need to be protected!

**Chapter**
### **[Scientists ]** **Who Classify** **Animals**
# **15**

Rattenborough, here once again! You have been
learning about how scientists study the **characteristics**
of living things� They **classify** all living things into one
of five large groups called **kingdoms**  - You have been
learning a lot about how animals are sorted into more
specific groups within the animal **kingdom**  

The scientists who study animals and their
**characteristics** are called **zoologists**  - **Zoologists observe**
animals to see the ways they are the same and the ways
they are different� For example, **zoologists** discovered
that some animals are **warm-blooded** and some are
**cold-blooded**  

119


**Zoologists** also **classify** animals by whether or not
they have a backbone� Animals with a backbone and a
spinal cord are called **vertebrates** - Animals that do not
have a backbone are called **invertebrates** - We learned
that there are five groups of **vertebrates** —fish, birds,
**amphibians**, **reptiles**, and **mammals** - The largest group
of **vertebrates** is fish�


**Zoologists** also study other **characteristics** of
animals� They study animal body parts and how they
are alike or different� All animals need to breathe
**oxygen** - But they may have different organs that help
them breathe� Fish and young **amphibians** have **gills**
that help them get **oxygen** out of the water� **Mammals**,
**reptiles**, and adult **amphibians** get **oxygen** from the air
using lungs�


120


**Zoologists** also study how different animal babies
are born and cared for� Do you remember which group
of animal mothers feed their babies milk from their own
bodies?


Everything we have learned about animals was
discovered by scientists� There have been many scientists
who have been interested in animals since long, long
ago� A Greek man named Aristotle first **classified**
animals over 2,000 years ago� He wrote a book called
A History of Animals� As scientists have discovered and
learned more about animals, the **classification** system
has changed� There is still much to learn about animals�
After all, there are thousands of new animals yet to be
discovered and **classified!**


121


_A statue of Aristotle_



122


Every single day, scientists learn new facts about
animals� Scientists even find new animals they didn’t
know existed� There is no end to new knowledge if you
study living things!


Today, there are about one million scientists around
the world who are studying and **classifying** animals,
even as you read this� Every one of them spends the day
**observing**, experimenting, and finding new information�
This adds to our knowledge about the world we live in�


123


_Do you remember which group of animals feed their babies milk_
_from their own bodies?_


124


If you want to be a **zoologist** when you grow up,
there is plenty to study� You never know when someone
is going to learn something that changes the way we
think about the world� Who knows? Maybe you will be
the first to find a **feathered** fish or a flying snail� It may
sound silly now, but a hundred years ago, nobody knew
that whales **communicated** with each other� What will
you discover?


125


_What kind of animals would you like to_ _**observe**_ _if you were_
_a_ _**zoologist**_ _?_

### **Vertebrate**

**Chapter**
### **Animals** **Around the** **World**
# **16**


**Read-Aloud**

All My Best Friends Represent **Vertebrates** ! Now
that you’ve learned about each **vertebrate** group, you
know about many **characteristics** that taxonomists use
to **classify** these animals� Who wants to try naming the
five groups of animals that make up **vertebrates** in the
animal **kingdom** ?


Why do scientists **classify** organisms? Because there
are so many living things on Earth, it gives scientists a
way of studying them by showing their relationships�
And how do they **classify** them? They look for common,
or shared, **characteristics**  - What are some of these
common **characteristics** ? You’ve learned that some
animals are **warm-blooded** and others are **cold-blooded**  Some are **vertebrates** and others are **invertebrates**  You’ve also learned that there are many other ways to


127


**classify** animals into smaller and smaller groups� The
scientific classification system, taxonomy, uses these
names— **kingdom**, phylum, class, order, family, genus,
and species—to describe the groups from largest to
smallest�


When they **classify** animals, taxonomists compare
and contrast animal **habitats**, physical **characteristics**,
skin coverings, feeding habits, and **reproduction** - Today
we’re going to look at seven different locations on planet
Earth, one on each of the continents of the world� We
can use our new skills to practice **classifying** a few of the
animals that live in each place�


First stop, the American desert! Here are some
examples of animals you may find in this North
American desert: the western diamondback rattlesnake,
the Gila [hee-luh] woodpecker, the desert bighorn
sheep in the background, the roadrunner, the banded
Gila monster, the bobcat, and the turkey vulture� Just
by looking at these animals, are you able to **classify**
them? The bobcat and the sheep are both covered in fur,
so we know they are **mammals** - What about the Gila
monster? It’s a **reptile**, one of only two **venomous** lizards
in America� What kind of animal is this rattlesnake,
which is also covered in **scales** ? Yes, it is a **reptile** —it is


128


_Sonoran Desert_

**venomous** as well, and it is one of the few **reptiles** that
gives birth to live young�


Great job! Let’s move on to the Amazon Rainforest in
South America� Native to the rainforest are the spotted
jaguar, the green anaconda, the three-toed sloth, the
red-bellied piranha, the blue-and-yellow macaw, the
pink-toed tarantula, and the caiman, which looks like
a small crocodile� The anaconda and the caiman are
both covered in **scales**  - The bird should be an easy one
to spot—the only one with wings and **feathers** is the
macaw� And the piranha should be familiar to all of
you—these are Paolo’s fish relatives� The jaguar and sloth


129


both belong to the same group� Who can name that
group? Great—they’re **mammals** ; we can tell because
they are covered in fur� As you have learned, **mammals**
give birth to live babies� Does this dark, hairy spider
belong to one of the **vertebrate** groups we’ve studied?
No, the pink-toed tarantula is an **invertebrate** - It’s **cold-**
**blooded**, has an exoskeleton, and is a member of the
arachnid group�


_South American Rainforest_




_Alpine Mountains_


Let’s look at some of the animals that make their
homes high in the Alpine mountains of Europe� What
do you see in the background, there on the rocks? The
rock ptarmigan [tahr-mi-guhn] lives in the Alps� So
does the black Alpine salamander, the marmot, the
golden eagle, the Apollo butterfly, and the pine marten�
Which one do you think is not a member of any of the
**vertebrate** groups we’ve studied? Yes, the butterfly is
an **invertebrate**, and is classified in the largest group of
animals on Earth: insects! The black Alpine salamander
shares **characteristics** with both a lizard and a frog�
Think about how you would **classify** it� It’s a moistskinned **amphibian**, but an unusual one that lives only


131


on land and gives birth to fully developed live young�
What two-legged, **feathered** animals do you see? Yes, the
birds pictured are the ptarmigan and the golden eagle�
And **mammals** —are there any fur-covered creatures in
the Alps? Yes, the marmot and the pine marten�


The Ganges [gan-jeez] **Delta** of India, on the
continent of Asia, is home to swamps, forests, and
creeks� The animals that live there include the blackcrowned night heron, the wild boar, the Olive Ridley
turtle, the Ganges River dolphin, the Indian python,
the blue-eared kingfisher, the mugger crocodile, and the
chital� Can you spot the **cold-blooded** **reptiles** here?


_The Ganges_ _**Delta**_


You bet—the crocodile, the turtle, and the python are
all representatives of the **reptile** group� Which ones are
**warm-blooded** **mammals** ? Yes, the boar, or wild pig,
and the chital, a common deer of the area� The polluted
waters of the Ganges River have ruined the **ecosystem**
for a number of animals, and this river dolphin is
endangered because of the river’s pollution� Only one of
four river dolphin species in the world, it is a **mammal**
just like its ocean-loving relatives� The Ganges river
dolphin is sometimes called the blind dolphin; each of
its eyes lacks a lens to give it clear vision, but it still uses
its eyes to help it find direction� And, of course, our
**feathered** friends of the sky—the kingfisher and the
heron—are both birds�


133


_African savanna_


I bet you’ve seen pictures of the many large game
animals that make their homes in the savannas of Africa�
They include the giraffe, the elephant, the hyena, the
wildebeest, the lion, the zebra, and the impala� All of
these animals belong to the same group of **vertebrate**
animals� What are they? Yes, **mammals** ! Birds, like the
hornbill and the quelea [kwee-lee-uh], live there as well�
And **venomous** **reptiles**, snakes like the gaboon and the
black mamba, are deadly to their prey in the savannas�


134


The Great Barrier Reef of Australia is home to
many different sea animals� Animals here include the
bottlenose dolphin, the anemonefish, the blue spotted
stingray, the box jellyfish, the black-tipped reef shark,
and the leatherback sea turtle� Is the jellyfish a fish?
Who remembers? No, in spite of its name, the jellyfish
is an **invertebrate** and has no **gills**  - Be sure to notice
the jellyfish’s many long **tentacles**  - So, do you think the
anemonefish is a fish or not? Yes, it is indeed a fish, also
called the clown fish because of its colorful markings,


_Coral reef_


135


and it lives among the tentacles of another **invertebrate**,
the sea anemone� The sea turtle belongs to the **reptile**
group, and you probably remember that the dolphin is
a milk-producing **mammal** that breathes with its lungs�
How about the shark? Yes, it is a fish too� It breathes
through **gills**, and unlike the dolphin, does not provide
milk for its young� And the stingray? A fish, too—a
relative of the shark�


Finally, let’s look at Antarctica, the southernmost
continent and one of the coldest places on Earth�
Emperor penguins live in its icy waters, along with
blue whales and humpback whales� Leopard seals, skua,
and snow petrels spend half the year in darkness in
this frozen coastal region� Only two **vertebrate** animal
groups are found on the land in Antarctica� What are
they? That’s right, **mammals** and birds� You learned
that these two groups also share another common
**characteristic** as well� **Mammals** and birds are both
**warm-blooded** - The energy in the food they eat is used
to warm their bodies and keep them from freezing�


These Antarctic animals **survive** in harsh frozen
conditions, and they are largely dependent on krill, tiny
shrimp-like crustaceans with exoskeletons that live in the
waters beneath the ice packs� They are the primary, or
main, source of food for the **predators** of Antarctica�


136


_Antarctic ice shelf_

As you can imagine, living in the extreme cold of
Antarctica presents a major challenge to **cold-blooded**
animals� A few fish have **adapted** in an interesting way
to **survive** in the cold waters surrounding Antarctica�
The icefish has a special chemical in its body that acts
like an **antifreeze** and keeps it from freezing!


A few **invertebrates** have found other interesting ways
to **survive** the cold **temperatures** of Antarctica� Some
mites **survive** by living in the fur of **mammals** or in the
**feathers** of birds, close to the warmth of their **warm-**
**blooded** **hosts**  - Now you’ve seen a sample of the animals
that live on each of the seven continents�


137


There are so many interesting facts about Earth’s
animals! Before I go, let’s each share one interesting
fact that you have learned about **vertebrate** animals�
Think for a moment about the interesting fact that you
wish to share� Turn to your neighbor and share your
**vertebrate** fact�


It’s been so much fun for me to be with you again�
I’m so proud of all that you’ve learned about the animal
**kingdom** over the past few days� I’ll look forward to
seeing you again soon� In the meantime, I encourage you
to keep your eyes open� As you see an animal or read
about an animal, think about how you would **classify** it�
Next time we’re together, perhaps you can tell me about
your discoveries� Until then, goodbye!

### **Deep-Sea Fish**



Oceans are very, very deep bodies of water� However,
people cannot go very deep into the ocean� Even with all
the right **scuba gear**, including a tank of **oxygen**, there is
a limit to how deep you can go underwater� The deeper
you go, the higher the **water pressure** gets because of the
**weight** of all the water around you�


You can notice **water pressure** if you swim to the
bottom of a pool� If you rest on the floor of the pool for
a few seconds, you will start to feel the pressure in your
eardrums�


The deeper you go in the ocean, the higher the **water**
**pressure** gets� If you dive a few hundred feet down, you
will start to feel like someone is squeezing your head and
chest� At 1,000 feet, you might pass out� Go deeper than
that and you might be crushed by all the **water pressure** !


139


_Scuba divers feel more_ _**water pressure**_ _the deeper they dive in_
_the ocean._



140


How deep are oceans? That depends on where you
are in the world� Some parts are a few yards deep, while
others are around 10,000 feet� The deepest part of the
ocean is more than six miles deep! Down there, the
**water pressure** is very strong� It is so strong, it would
feel as if someone dropped 3,300 elephants on you at the
same time� In other words, you would be crushed to the
size of an ant, maybe smaller�


No creature that lives on land can **survive** the **water**
**pressure** of the deep ocean� Most fish can’t either�
However, there is life down there—lots of it! How do we
know? Scientists have created special **submarines** called
**submersibles** that can go deep in the ocean�


Some **submersibles** can carry a person or two�
Others are controlled remotely from the surface� With a
light and a camera, a **submersible** can be used to explore
the deepest parts of an ocean� Scientists developed the
first **submersible** about 50 years ago and have been
discovering some pretty crazy-looking fish ever since!


141


_A_ _**submersible**_ _exploring deep underwater_



142


Fish that live deep down in the ocean are unlike any
other living things� They have incredibly thick bodies
because they need to withstand all that **water** **pressure**  

No sunlight reaches the bottom of the ocean, so it’s
completely dark down there� Many deep-sea fish glow!
Lantern fish are the most common deep-sea fish� In fact,
they are among the most common of all **vertebrates**  There are billions of them down there!


143


_Lantern fish_



144


The anglerfish is easily one of the strangest creatures
on Earth� Have you ever seen anything so ugly?
Anglerfish are known for their huge mouths and scary
teeth� What is more amazing is that they have a builtin flashlight on their head used to **communicate** with
other fish�


Humans have only managed to explore a tiny part
of the deep seas� If you are interested in discovering new
creatures, then you might want to think about becoming
a deep-sea **marine biologist**, which is a scientist who
explores ocean life�

**Chapter**
### **The Komodo** **Dragon**
# **18**

You have probably heard or read at least one fairy tale
with a dragon as a character� In these stories, dragons fly
around breathing fire and frightening innocent people,
until a brave knight comes along and kills the dragon�
Well, you won’t find fire-breathing dragons in a book
about animal classification� There is no proof that these
fairy tale dragons ever **existed**  

There is, however, one real dragon that does **exist** :
the **Komodo dragon**  - No, it does not breathe fire and
it does not fly� It’s just a big **reptile**  - They can be pretty
mean� It’s rare, but they have attacked and even killed
humans� So, be careful if you are ever traveling through
Indonesia�


147


_Fire-breathing dragons are found only in fairy tales and movies._
_The_ _**Komodo dragon**_ _is a large_ _**reptile**_ _found in Indonesia._


148


These dragons are named after the **island** of
Komodo, which is part of Indonesia� They can be found
on four or five other Indonesian **islands**, as well, but
overall they are pretty rare�


They prefer hot, dry places� They dig **burrows** two
to three feet deep in the ground� Like most **reptiles**, they
spend most of their time sleeping or simply relaxing�


A **Komodo dragon** can be as big, or bigger, than a
crocodile� They weigh up to 150 pounds and can be over
ten feet long from tail to head� The largest one on record
weighed 370 pounds, or as much as about six third
graders�


149


_A_ _**Komodo dragon**_ _can be as large, or larger, than a crocodile._



150


Like many **reptiles**, they can’t hear or see very well�
Instead, they have a strong sense of smell� They do not
use their **nostrils** to smell—they use their **tongue** ! They
can smell food several miles away if the wind is blowing
in the right direction!


Speaking of food, Komodo dragons are **carnivores**,
so they eat mainly meat� For the most part, they eat dead
animals� But if there are no dead animals around, they
hunt for food�


151


_**Komodo dragons**_ _use their tongues to smell!_



152


They have sharp claws and teeth and, when needed,
can move pretty fast� They are the only lizards known to
attack, kill, and eat animals that are bigger than they are�
They might hunt a goat, deer, and even water buffalo!


Young **Komodo dragons** eat insects, smaller
**mammals**, and birds� How? They climb trees and catch
them� They will eat anything they can get their claws on,
as long as it’s meaty�


You definitely don’t want a **Komodo dragon** to bite
you or even lick you! Its **saliva** is loaded with dangerous
germs that can make people very sick� The best way to
**observe** a **Komodo dragon** is at a zoo, unless you are
very brave or very foolish!


153


_The safest way to_ _**observe**_ _a_ _**Komodo dragon**_ _is at a zoo._
