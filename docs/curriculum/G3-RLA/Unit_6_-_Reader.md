###### **[The Sun, ]**


## **1**


###### **Earth, and** **Our Solar System**



Look up in the sky at noon� What do you see? If it
is not cloudy, you will see the sun shining brightly in
the sky�


The sun provides energy—both light and heat�
The sun’s light and heat give life to plants and animals�
Without the sun, Earth would be freezing cold� Have
you ever wondered what the sun is made of or why it
gives off so much light and heat?



2


_The sun gives us light and heat._



3


_A close-up of the sun_

You may be surprised to know that the sun is a star�
It is in fact the closest star to Earth� It is made up of
different, hot gases� How hot? A hot summer day on
Earth is 100 degrees� On the sun, it is 10,000 degrees!
The sun stays that hot all the time! The sun’s gases create
the light and heat it gives off�


Long ago, people thought that the sun moved around
Earth� This seemed to make sense� Each morning at the
start of the day, the sun rose in the east� At the end of
the day, the sun set in the west—exactly opposite from
where it had come up� To explain this change, people
said the sun moved around Earth� But now we know that
this is not what really happens� The sun does not move
around Earth� It is Earth that moves around the sun!

4


The sun is in the center of a group of eight **planets**   All of these **planets**, including Earth, circle, or **orbit**,
around the sun� The sun, **planets**, and other objects in
space that **orbit** the sun are called the **solar system** - The
word _solar_ has the Latin root word _sol_, which means “the
sun�” Everything in the **solar system** relates to the sun�


_**Planets orbiting**_ _the sun_
5


Our **planet**, Earth, moves in two ways� We have just
learned that Earth circles, or revolves, around the sun�
It takes about 365 days, which is one year, for Earth to
**orbit**, or revolve, around the sun�


Earth also moves by spinning, or **rotating**, on its **axis**   It is this spinning that makes day and night on Earth and
the motion of the sun across the sky from sunrise to sunset�
It takes one day for Earth to make one complete **rotation**
on its **axis** - As Earth **rotates** and spins, different parts of it
face the sun� When the part facing the sun gets sunlight, it
is daytime on that side of Earth� The part that faces away
from the sun gets no sunlight� So, on that side of Earth, it
is nighttime� Did you know that when it is daytime where
we live, it is nighttime on the other side of Earth?


_Earth spins on its_ _**axis**_ _. On the side of Earth facing the sun, it is_
_daytime. On the side facing away from the sun, it is nighttime._

6


_When Earth is_ _**tilted**_ _on its_ _**axis**_ _towards the sun, it is spring_
_and summer. When Earth is_ _**tilted**_ _on its_ _**axis**_ _away from the_
_sun, it is fall and winter._


When Earth **rotates** on its **axis**, it is **tilted**  - At certain
times of the year, one part of Earth is **tilted** toward the
sun� The sunlight is more direct and it feels hotter� For
people living on this part of Earth, it is summer� For
people living on the part of Earth **tilted** away from the
sun, there is less sunlight and it is winter� So, when it
is summertime for us, there are people living on other
parts of Earth where it is winter! So, the fact that Earth is
**tilted** on its **axis** is what creates the seasons of the year�

**Chapter**

##### **The Moon**
# **2**

Look up in the sky at night� What do you see? If it is
not cloudy, you may be able to see the moon�


When you see the moon at night, it might look
white� It might look gray or silver� Sometimes, it seems
to shine and glow� But the moon does not give off light
the way the sun does� The moon is a ball of rock that
gives off no light of its own� It simply reflects light from
the sun� That means light from the sun hits the moon
and bounces off�


8


_Our moon is easily visible on most clear nights._



9


You already know that Earth **orbits** around the
sun� But did you know that the moon **orbits** around
Earth? It takes just about one month for the moon to
completely circle Earth� If you look up at the night sky
each night of the month, you may think that the size and
shape of the moon is changing� However, the size and
shape are not really changing� The moon is still a round
ball� It looks different at different times of the month
because of the way the light from the sun is reflected and
how much of the moon we can see from Earth�


_might see if you looked at the moon each night for a month. You_
_can read the chart just like you would read a book. Start at the_
_top and go from left to right. When you finish reading the first_
_row, go on to the next one. You can see how the moon seems to_
_change during the month._

10


The way that Earth,
the moon, and the sun
move can also make other
interesting things to look at
in the sky� When Earth, the
moon, and the sun all move
together in a direct line,
something called an **eclipse**
can take place�


We can see two kinds of
**eclipses** from Earth� One
kind happens when the
moon gets in between the
sun and Earth� When that
happens, we can’t see the
sun for a while� At least, we
can’t see part of it� We call
this a solar **eclipse** or an
**eclipse** of the sun�


_During an_ _**eclipse**_ _of the sun,_
_the moon moves between Earth_
_and sun and blocks out the sun._
11


The other kind of **eclipse**, called a lunar **eclipse**, also
involves the sun, the moon, and Earth� It takes place
when the moon passes behind Earth and into its shadow�
In the image on the next page, you can see that a shadow
covers part of the moon� It is Earth’s shadow that you
see� Earth has blocked out the sun and left part of the
moon in darkness�


**Eclipses** do not happen often because the sun,
Earth, and the moon all have to line up just right� Solar
**eclipses** can only be seen from a narrow strip of Earth at
a time� While they happen once or twice a year, it is very,
very rare to see one� **Eclipses** of the moon happen more
often, several times each year� They can be seen from half
of Earth at a time, so are more often visible�


Whether or not you can see an **eclipse** depends on
where you are on Earth� You must never look directly at
a solar **eclipse** - The sun is very bright and could burn
your eyes� But, it is safe to look at an **eclipse** of the
moon� If an **eclipse** is predicted, it is usually big news,
so you will likely hear about it�

##### **The Planets** **Chapter Closest to the Sun:**

**Mercury, Venus, Earth,**
**and Mars**
# **3**

Our **planet** Earth is one of eight **planets** in our **solar**
**system** that **revolves** around the sun� The other **planets**
are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
and Neptune� People have been looking at the **planets**
for thousands of years� People from Mesopotamia, the
Greeks, Mayans, Incas, and Aztecs were all interested in
the **planets** - They used just their **naked eye** to study the
**planets** - Now, we have telescopes and other tools that
help us get a better look at the **planets** 

14


15


The four **planets** closest to the sun—Mercury,
Venus, Earth, and Mars—are small **planets** - These
**planets** have a rocky, or solid, surface�


Mercury and Venus are closer to the sun than Earth�
The other **planets** are farther away�


Earth needs 365 days to make one **orbit** around the
sun� That is the length of one year on Earth�


The closer a **planet** is to the sun, the less time it
needs to make a **revolution** around the sun� Mercury
is the closest **planet** to the sun� It needs just 88 days to
make one **orbit** - Venus is the next closest to the sun� It
needs just 225 days to make an **orbit** - The **planets** that
are farther away take much longer� It takes Neptune
165 years to **orbit**, or revolve, around the sun!


16


_The sun and_ _**planets**_


17


Besides being closest to the sun, Mercury is the
smallest of all the **planets** - The English name for the
**planet** comes from the Romans� They named the **planet**
after the Roman god Mercury� The Greek name for this
same god is Hermes�


Venus is the second **planet** from the sun and is
closest to Earth� This **planet** was named after the Roman
goddess of love� For a long time, scientists thought that
Venus might be a lot like Earth� After all, it is close to
Earth� It is about the same size as Earth and it is covered
with clouds, like Earth� But this idea turned out to be
wrong, too� We know now that Venus and Earth are
different in lots of ways�


Scientists had to change their ideas to fit the new
facts� They have now concluded that Venus is much
hotter than Earth� It would not be a good place for us to
live or even visit�


18


_Mercury (top) and Venus_


19


Mars is the fourth **planet** from the sun� It is named
after the Roman god of war� When you look at Mars in
the night sky, it looks quite red� This is because the rocks
on Mars contain rust�


Many space **probes** and robots have landed on Mars�
They have taken photographs and also dug up rocks�


One **probe** that went to Mars not long ago found
some ice� That was big news� Ice is frozen water� If there
is water on Mars, there might be life� Some experts argue
that nothing could live on Mars� They say it is too cold
and too dry� Others think there might be life on Mars�
They think there might be something alive down under
the rocks� Still others think there might have been life on
Mars at one time but there isn’t any now�

**Chapter**
# **4**


##### **The Outer Planets:**

**Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and**
**Neptune**



Do you remember the names of the four **planets**
closest to the sun? If you said, “Mercury, Venus, Earth,
and Mars,” you are right! There are four more **planets**
called the outer **planets** - So there are eight **planets** in all�


Jupiter is the very next **planet** after Mars� After
Jupiter come Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune in that
order� Neptune is the **planet** that is farthest from the
sun� Uranus is difficult to see with the **naked eye** and
Neptune is impossible to see without help� Neptune is
only visible using a telescope�


22


23


The outer **planets** are very large and are mostly made
of gas� Scientists often call these **planets** **gas giants** - Of
all the **planets**, Jupiter is the largest: 1,300 Earths could
fit inside Jupiter! It is made mostly of **hydrogen** gas, the
most common gas in the universe�


The gases on Jupiter seem to be blowing around� In
the image of Jupiter on the next page, you can see the
giant, red spot� It looks like an eye! Experts think it is a
big wind storm, like a huge hurricane�


Jupiter also has 63 known moons that **orbit**, or
revolve around, it� Some of these moons are very large,
even larger than Earth’s moon�


_Jupiter and some of its moons_


24


_Saturn and its rings_


Saturn is known for its many large rings that **revolve**
around the **planet** - These rings are made of ice and dust�
The ice reflects light and makes the rings glow� Saturn
also has many moons that **revolve** around it�
25


The last two **planets** are Uranus and Neptune� These
**planets** are the farthest from the sun so they are very
cold� Uranus and Neptune also have rings, but they
aren’t easily seen like Saturn’s� Both **planets** also have
moons�


So now you know the names of all eight **planets**  Try asking the adults in your family how many **planets**
there are� They may tell you that there are nine **planets** When the adults in your family were in school, people
said that there was a ninth **planet** called Pluto� But in
2006, scientists decided that Pluto did not have all of the
characteristics needed to be classified as a **planet** - They
removed Pluto’s name from the list of **planets**, so now
there are only eight **planets** 

26


_This is Neptune as it might look if seen from one of its moons. The_
_shadow of another moon makes a dark spot on the planet’s surface._

# **5**


##### **Asteroids, Comets,** **and Meteors**



There are other objects that **orbit**, or revolve,
around the sun in the **solar system** besides the
**planets** - Millions of space rocks called **asteroids** also
**orbit** the sun� **Asteroids** are made of rock, metal, and
sometimes ice� Many **asteroids** are found **revolving**
around the sun between the **planets** Mars and Jupiter�
They **cluster** together in a shape like a belt as they
**revolve** around the sun� This part of the **solar system**
is called the **asteroid belt** 

28


_Top: An artist’s image of an_ _**asteroid belt**_ _around a star_
_Bottom: An up-close image of an_ _**asteroid**_ _from our_ _**solar system**_


29


**Comets** also **revolve** around the sun� **Comets** are
made mostly of ice and dust� When a **comet** gets close
to the sun, the sun’s heat causes some of the **comet** to
change into a gas� This gas streams off the end of the
**comet** like a tail�


The most famous **comet** is **Halley’s Comet**  - It is
named for the British scientist Edmund Halley who first
discovered it� **Halley’s Comet** is visible from Earth with
the **naked eye** every 76 years� It was last seen in 1986�
Can you figure out when it will be seen again?


30


_A_ _**comet**_ _in the night sky_

31


Other kinds of space rocks called **meteoroids** are also
found throughout the **solar system** - When a **meteoroid**
enters Earth’s **atmosphere**, we call it a **meteor** - Small
pieces of the **meteor** burn brightly and look like a white
trail across the sky when viewed from Earth� Sometimes
people call this a “shooting star�” Have you ever seen
one? A **meteor** “shower” is when many **meteors** can be
seen falling in the sky on the same night� Sometimes
they last over several nights� It’s an amazing space show!


If a **meteor** doesn’t fully burn up in the **atmosphere**,
it falls to Earth and can make a large hole called a crater�
Pieces of a **meteor** found on the ground are **meteorites.**


32

_**meteorite**_ _hit Earth. Notice the road and buildings to the_
_left of the crater. This crater is very big!_


**Chapter**

##### **Galaxies and Stars**
# **6**

Look up in the sky at night� What do you see besides
the moon? If it is not cloudy, you may be able to see lots
of stars glittering in the sky�


Remember that the sun is also a star� The stars in the
night sky do not look like the sun� They do not look as
big or as bright� But they are, in fact, very much alike�
The stars in the night sky are big balls of hot gas, just
like the sun�


So why don’t they look the same? The night stars are
much, much farther away from Earth than the sun� That
is why they look like tiny specks of light� If we could get
close to the stars, they would look bigger, brighter, and
more like the sun� But the stars we see at night are so far
away that no one from Earth has ever been able to get
close to them�


34


_Stars in the night sky_

35


Scientists who study the stars and outer space are
called **astronomers** - The Greek root word _astron_ means
star� The prefix _astro_ is used in many other English
words�


All stars are big balls of hot gas, but **astronomers**
have discovered that stars differ in many ways� Stars can
be different sizes and colors� Some stars are closer to
Earth than others and some stars are hotter than others�
Stars that are the hottest and closest to Earth appear
brighter than other stars�


36


_All stars are made of gases, but they can differ in size, color,_
_and brightness._

37


**Astronomers** also discovered that stars **cluster**
together in large groups� A large group of stars that
**cluster** together in one area is called a **galaxy** _._ There are
**billions** and **billions** of stars in one **galaxy** - That’s a lot
of stars!


The **galaxy** to which our sun and **solar system**
belong is called the **Milky Way Galaxy** - It has a **spiral**
shape when viewed from space� From Earth, it looks like
a “milky” band of white light�


38


_The_ _**Milky Way**_ _as it appears in the night sky_


39


The nearest **spiral** **galaxy** to the **Milky Way Galaxy**
is called the **Andromeda Galaxy** - It is **billions** and
**billions** of miles from the **Milky Way Galaxy** - You have
probably heard of a million before� A million is a huge
number� So what’s a **billion** ? It’s one thousand million! It
is safe to say that the **Andromeda Galaxy** is a long, long,
long way away! Even so, it is sometimes possible to see
the **Andromeda Galaxy** at night�


Scientists think there are **billions** of **galaxies** in the
universe� There’s that number **billions** again� There are
**billions** of stars in each **galaxy** and **billions** of **galaxies**
in the universe—that is almost more than you can
think about!


40


_**Andromeda Galaxy**_


41


**Chapter**

##### **Constellations**
# **7**

Go outside one night and look at the stars� Of the
**billions** of stars in our **galaxy**, it is possible to see only
2,000 with the **naked eye** - When you first look at them,
you might not see much� They might look like just a
bunch of tiny dots�


Look a little closer� You will see that some stars shine
more brightly than others� Focus on the bright stars�
Which ones really jump out at you?


Then, focus on the spaces in between the bright stars�
Ask yourself, “What would it look like if I drew lines
from one bright star to the next? What would it look like
if I were to connect the dots? Would I see any shapes?
Would I see any patterns? _”_


Since ancient times, people have been studying the
stars� When ancient people looked at the stars, some
seemed to be closer together and formed patterns�


42


_On a clear night away from city lights, you can see_
_the stars that fill the night sky._

43


One of the first people to describe these star patterns,
called **constellations**, was a man named Ptolemy [TOlə-mee]� He picked out the brightest stars and traced
lines from one star to the next� He saw all types of shapes
and patterns� One looked like a bull� He saw another
that looked like a crab� A third looked like a bear� In
all, he found 48 **constellations** - Much later, 40 more
**constellations** were added to Ptolemy’s list� Today,
**astronomers** say there are 88 **constellations** that can be
seen in the night sky�


On the next page is a drawing of a **constellation**
that Ptolemy described� It is called **Ursa Major** or Big
Bear� The white dots or circles stand for the stars in the
**constellation** - The dotted lines connect the stars and
trace the pattern so you can see the shape� Do you see
a Big Bear in the pattern? It does not look exactly like a
real bear� So, you may need to imagine that it looks like
a bear� Hint: its head is to the left with its nose being the
star that is on the far left�


44


_**Ursa Major**_


45


Within **Ursa Major**, there are seven very bright stars
that form another small group of stars called the Big
Dipper� Look at the image at the top of the next page�
Can you see why it is called the Big Dipper? When
you trace a line from star to star, the shape looks like
a dipper _._ A dipper is like a **ladle** you can use to scoop
something into a bowl� The stars on the left look like the
handle� The stars on the right look like the scoop�


Ptolemy also described another **constellation** called
**Ursa Minor** or Little Bear� This **constellation** is also
made up of seven stars� In the image on the bottom of
the next page, the seven dots stand for the stars� An artist
has added a drawing of a bear to help you better imagine
how the star pattern looks like a bear�


46


_The Big Dipper_


_**Ursa Minor**_


**Ursa Minor** is also called the Little Dipper� The
brightest star at the end of the handle is called **Polaris** Can you see it? **Polaris** stays in the same place in the
night sky all year long� (Other stars are found in different
places in the sky at different times of the year�) **Polaris’s**
place in the sky is almost directly over the North Pole of
Earth� By finding **Polaris**, also called the North Star, you
can find the direction north and the other directions� In
ancient times, sailors and explorers used this star to find
their way when they traveled�


Try to find **Polaris** the next time you look at the
night sky� Start by first looking for the Big Dipper
because it is easier to find� Then, find the two “pointer”
stars at the edge of the Big Dipper’s scoop� Then, pretend
there is a long arrow pointing the same way as the
pointer stars� The first star you will see at the end of the
arrow is **Polaris** 

48

**Chapter**

##### **Exploring Space**
# **8**

As you have learned in the last chapters, people have
been interested in studying space since ancient times�
It was possible to see only some stars and **planets** with
the **naked eye** - Since they were far, far away, it was
impossible to see anything in very much detail�


In 1609, an astronomer named Galileo [ga-li-lae-oe]
created a telescope that he used to observe the night sky�
Galileo’s telescope made things appear three times larger�
Using his telescope, he discovered four of the many
moons that **orbit** the **planet** Jupiter� He also observed
the **planet** Saturn and the Milky Way�


50


_A portrait of Galileo holding a telescope_


51


Since Galileo’s time, scientists have created more
and more powerful telescopes� Some telescopes are
housed in large **observatories** on Earth� Often, these
**observatories** are on the top of mountains, far away
from any cities or lights� This allows **astronomers** to
clearly see the stars and **planets** 

_Building an_ _**observatory**_ _on top of a mountain helps to get a_
_better view of the sky._

52


_The_ _**Hubble Telescope**_ _orbits Earth above its atmosphere._


Other telescopes are **launched** into space using
rockets� They travel far above Earth and have a better view
of the universe than telescopes on Earth� One of these
telescopes is the **Hubble Telescope** - It was **launched** in
1990 by **NASA**, the American group of scientists who
study outer space� The **Hubble Telescope** is still in space
today, **orbiting** Earth� Since its **launch**, it has sent back
thousands of photos to **NASA** - **Hubble’s** photos have led
to many new discoveries about the universe� For example,
using photos from **Hubble**, scientists have seen further
into space, including a galaxy that is calculated to be
13�4 billion light-years from Earth�
53


Besides sending telescopes into space, **NASA**
has also **launched** rocket ships into space� Scientists
thought it was too dangerous for humans to ride the
first rocket ships into space� They did not know what
effects space travel might have on humans� So, **NASA**
first sent chimpanzees into space on rocket ships� “Why
chimpanzees?” you might ask� Think back to what you
learned in a previous reader about animals� Chimpanzees
are mammals and belong to the same group of
animals, called primates, as humans� By studying the
chimpanzees, scientists hoped to learn how space travel
might affect humans�


_Ham, one of the first chimpanzees launched into space_


After determining space travel would be safe for
humans with test flights incolving chimpanzees, **NASA**
was ready to start manned space flight� In 1961, NASA
built the Manned Spacecraft Center, later called the
Johnson Center, just outside of Houston, Texas, the
headquarters for all future space flights� And in 1961,
NASA sent the first American **astronaut** into space on
a rocket ship� His name was Alan Shepard� He stayed in
space for only 15 minutes�


_Alan Shepard was the first American_ _**astronaut**_ _in space._


55


_**Apollo 11**_ _fires its rockets during lift-off._


After 1961, **NASA** sent more **manned** flights into
space� These flights **orbited** Earth but did not stop or
land anywhere in space� Then, in 1969, the United
States sent a rocket ship to the moon� The rocket ship
was called **Apollo 11** 


56


Have you ever tried to throw a ball up in the air?
The ball goes up at first� Then, it comes back down�
No matter how hard you throw it, it comes back down
because of **gravity** - **Gravity** is a **force** of **attraction** that
pulls things toward one another� Earth’s **gravity** pulls the
ball back down to Earth�


Earth’s **gravity** is a challenge for rocket ships like
**Apollo 11** - In order to fly off into outer space, the
rocket ship has to push up with a lot of **force** - It has to
push up with so much **force** that **gravity** cannot pull it
back down�


**Apollo 11** fired a lot of strong rockets� It lifted off
and went up slowly at first� Then, it got faster and faster�
This is what it looked like after a few seconds� After just
a few seconds more, it shot up out of Earth’s **atmosphere**
and into outer space�


_**Apollo 11**_ _shooting up into space_

**Chapter**
# **9**


##### **A Walk** **on the Moon**



Once **Apollo 11** was up in space, the **astronauts** had
to steer it to the moon� There were three **astronauts** on
**Apollo 11** - You can see them in the image on the next
page� Each had a job to do� One of them was in charge
of flying the spaceship, called Columbia� The other two
had to get into a landing craft called the Eagle� Then,
they had to steer it down and land it on the moon�


58


_The Apollo 11 astronauts_

The **astronaut** who had to steer the Eagle was named
Neil Armstrong� He had to find a good, flat spot to land�
He also had to set the Eagle down gently�


Lots of people tuned in to watch Armstrong and the
Eagle on live TV� At first, Armstrong had a hard time
getting the Eagle to go where he wanted it to go� But, in
the end, he landed it just fine�


Armstrong sent a message back by radio: “The Eagle
has landed!”


The crowds watching it on TV went wild� They
danced and sang� They shouted and waved the United
States flag� For the first time ever, humans had landed on
the moon!


What happened next was even more amazing� The
**astronauts** went for a walk on the moon!


60


_Here is one of the Apollo 11 astronauts walking on the moon._
_Can you see his footprints?_

61


There is no air for breathing on the moon� It is also
very cold� So, the **astronauts** could not just walk out in
shorts and a T-shirt� They had to put on space suits like
the one in the image on the next page� They had to wear
masks� They had to carry tanks full of air for breathing�


Armstrong went out first� He went down the steps of
the Eagle until he was on the last one� Then, he made a
little hop� He landed on the moon and kicked up a little
moon dust� Then, he said, “That’s one small step for
man, one giant leap for mankind�” Another **astronaut**
joined Armstrong on the moon� His name was Buzz
Aldrin�


Once again, people watching it on TV cheered�
They were proud that the United States had put a man
on the moon!


62


_Buzz Aldrin plants the U.S. flag on the moon._

63


While Armstrong and Aldrin were on the moon,
pilot Michael Collins stayed on a part of the spaceship
that was still **orbiting** the moon� Armstrong and Aldrin
spent more than 21 hours on the moon� They found
that it was easy to move about on the moon, which has
less **gravity** than Earth� They could jump up high and
seemed to float down slowly� They used different tools
to explore the moon� They knew the scientists back on
Earth were hoping to learn new information about the
moon� They dug up samples of moon rocks to take back
to Earth�


After exploring the moon, Aldrin and Armstrong
got back in the Eagle� They lifted off� They met up with
Michael Collins on board the other part of the spaceship�
Then, all three of them flew back to Earth� The
spaceship came speeding back from space and splashed
down into the sea� A Navy ship came to pick up the
**astronauts** and take them back to **NASA**

**Chapter**
##### **What’s It Like**


# **10**


##### **in Space?**



Since **Apollo 11**, many more **astronauts** have
traveled in space� Scientists have learned that there are
many differences between Earth and space� One of the
biggest differences has to do with **gravity** - Remember
that **gravity** is a **force** of **attraction** that pulls things
toward one another� The **force** of **gravity** on Earth is
pretty strong� Even the best jumpers can only jump a few
feet off the ground� (Try it and see!)


_Want to jump_
_high? You will_
_have to fight_
_against gravity._

66


_This_ _**astronaut**_ _is_
_inside a spaceship in_
_space, where the_ _**force**_
_of_ _**gravity**_ _is less._


Remember that on the moon, **astronauts** Aldrin and
Armstrong were easily able to jump up high� They didn’t
come down quickly either� Instead, they seemed to float
down slowly� That was because the **force** of **gravity** on
the moon is not as strong as on Earth� The moon is not
as big as Earth� So the **force** of **gravity** is not as strong
on the moon�


If you think that is cool, wait until you read what
happens out in space, away from the moon or **planets** Out in space, **astronauts** do not feel the effects of
**gravity** - They and their spaceship are moving freely in
space� Since the **astronaut** and spaceship are moving
freely together, the **astronauts** look and feel as if they
are floating!
67


Up in space, lots of things are different� You can do a
flip and not worry about whether you will make it all the
way around before you come down!


_When you are free of the effects of_ _**gravity**_ _, it is easier to do flips_
_and cartwheels._


68


_Look, no hands! These_ _**astronauts’**_ _lunches appear to be floating!_


Eating is different in space, too� I’ll bet when you
eat lunch at school, your food stays where you put it� If
you set it on a table, it stays there until you pick it up�
The **force** of **gravity** holds it down� But if you were up
in space, you and your food would be moving freely
together� If you let go of it, your food might drift away!


69


There are other differences in space besides less
**gravity** - Do you remember that the **astronauts** on the
moon had to carry tanks of air for breathing? Another
way outer space is different from Earth is that there is
no air or oxygen at all in outer space� Look again at the
image on page 69 of the **astronauts** inside the spaceship�
The **astronauts** are not carrying tanks of air� That’s
because oxygen is being pumped inside the spaceship�


Since there is no air in space, you also do not hear
sounds in outer space� It is also very cold in space� The
**astronauts** must train many months before going into
space so they know what to expect� Do you think you
would like to go into space some day?


70


_This is what Earth looks like from the moon. Can you name some_
_ways that being in space is different from being on Earth?_

##### **The Space Shuttle**



Interest in **manned** space exploration soared after
**Apollo 11** - Other **astronauts** went to the moon� But
scientists were also interested in exploring other parts of
space beyond the moon� It was very expensive and took
a lot of time to build and send spaceships into space�
Do you remember that when **Apollo 11** returned from
space, it landed in the sea? It was not able to land safely
on the ground, so this type of spacecraft always had to
land in the sea� Once it landed in the sea, this kind of
spacecraft could not be used again�


In 1981, a **reusable** **spacecraft**, called a **space**
**shuttle**, was built� It was able to fly up into space and
then zoom back down to Earth� When it returned to
Earth, the pilot was able to land the spacecraft on a
runway almost like an airplane� It glided down from
space and landed on a runway, but it had to be a very
long runway�


72


_A_ _**space shuttle**_ _lifts off_

73


The **space shuttle** was flown back into space again
and again� It **shuttled** back and forth between Earth and
space� That is why it was called the **space shuttle** 

The image on the previous page shows the **launch** of
a **space shuttle** - The **space shuttle** itself is the white part
that looks like a jet plane� The other parts are **booster**
**rockets** - The **booster rockets** helped the **space shuttle**
get off the ground� They helped the **space shuttle**
overcome Earth’s **gravity** - Once the **space shuttle** was up
into space, it dropped the **booster rockets** because it no
longer needed them�


74

75


In the thirty years between 1981 and 2011, different
**space shuttles** carried **astronauts** up into space on
many missions� The **space shuttle** was also used to bring
research equipment and tools into space� The **astronauts**
did many experiments to find out more about space�
Scientists were **especially** interested in learning about
what effect the lack of **gravity** would have on humans
and other living things�


The **space shuttle** was also used to help build an
amazing space station� **Astronauts** could live at the space
station for months at a time� Often, the **space shuttle**
carried supplies back and forth from Earth to the space
station� It also provided a ride home to Earth when it
was time for the **astronauts** to return�


The last **space shuttle** mission took place in July
2011� **NASA** scientists and Americans were proud of
everything the **astronauts** had accomplished in thirty
years� With the end of the **space shuttle** missions, **NASA**
is planning other ways to explore space� Those plans
include **launching** **unmanned** **probes** and **satellites** **NASA** scientists hope to learn more about the moon’s
**gravity** and are even talking about trying to explore
**asteroids** !

##### **Dr. Mae Jemison**



Do you know what a role model is? A role model
is someone who sets an example for others by the
way they live� Many students admire people who are
famous athletes, movie stars, or singers and use them
as role models� They see them on TV, in newspapers
and in magazines, and decide they want to be like
them� But some of the best role models are people that
you probably would not see on TV or in newspapers�
They have jobs such as doctors, teachers, or police
officers� Some are scientists and **astronauts** - One such
person is Mae Jemison�



78


_Mae Jemison_


79


Mae Jemison was born October 17, 1956, in
Decatur, Alabama� Her family moved to Chicago,
Illinois when she was young� Mae always took great pride
in her schoolwork� She was interested in science, but was
also interested in the arts� She finished high school early
at age 16! From there, she went to Stanford University
in California� Most college students focus on only one
topic of study because college is so challenging� Mae
focused and excelled in two topics of study—chemical
engineering and African-American studies!


After Stanford, Mae entered medical school to
become a doctor� She wanted to use her medical training
to help people in different countries on the continent
of Africa� To do this, she joined the **Peace Corps** as
a volunteer� As part of the Peace Corps, Mae treated
patients and also helped train other **health care** workers�
She worked hard to help improve health care in the
countries where she worked�


80


_Stanford University, where Mae went to college_

81


After the **Peace Corps**, Mae came back to the United
States� She set her sights on a different goal� Her greatest
dream was to become an **astronaut** and travel into space�
She decided to apply to **NASA** to become an **astronaut** But the first time she applied, she was not accepted�
Instead of giving up, she tried again and **NASA** accepted
her the second time! She was one of only 15 people
chosen from a group of 2,000 people who wanted to
become **astronauts** !


Her training to become an **astronaut** was hard�
She had to get into great shape and train to get used to
being free of the effects of **gravity** in space� She also had
to study and pass many tests about space travel� Mae
Jemison succeeded in both�


82


_An experiment studying the effects_
_of_ _**weightlessness**_



83


In 1992, Mae was chosen for a mission on the
_**Endeavour**_ **space shuttle** - A rocket **launched** the
_**Endeavour**_ into **orbit** around Earth� Mae became the
first African-American female **astronaut** in space!


The mission was to study the effects of weightlessness
on plants and animals� Mae conducted experiments
during the mission with fellow **astronaut** Jan Davis�
They collected information that the scientists at **NASA**
could study� The mission was a great success�


After her successful mission, Mae retired from
**NASA** - She became a professor at Dartmouth College,
sharing her love of science and space with other students�
She also started her own company called The Jemison
Group, Inc� Mae’s company searches for ways that
science can help improve the lives of people in countries
around the world� Mae Jemison is truly a role model that
we can all admire!

##### **The International**


# **13**


##### **Space Station**



Would you like to have a bedroom in outer space?
Some **astronauts** do!


The United States and other countries use the **space**
**shuttle** to send **astronauts** to an **international** space
station� The space station **orbits** Earth� Three **astronauts**
can live there at one time� They stay for six months at a
time� This image shows the space station�


86


_The space station orbits Earth._

87


The space station **orbits** far above Earth� So the
**astronauts** in the space station don’t feel the effects of
**gravity** like we do on Earth� When we lift our arms and
legs here on Earth, we have to work against **gravity** - That
is good for us� It helps us stay in shape� But **astronauts**
in space don’t have the effects of **gravity** to work against�
They do not get much of a workout from drifting
around� They have to run at least once a day to stay in
good shape� In this image, you can see an **astronaut**
jogging in space�


_Astronauts have to jog in space to stay in shape._


_These two_
_**astronauts**_ _are_
_taking a nap_
_in space._


These two men are sleeping in space� They don’t feel
the effects of **gravity** so they are moving freely within
the spaceship� This means they can sleep right side up or
upside down� It is all the same� Do you think you would
like sleeping this way?
89


Taking a shower in space is tricky� On Earth,
the water comes out of the spout� It falls down and
splashes on your body� Then, it runs off� But this is
not what happens in space! In space, you have to rub
the water on your skin� Also, it does not just drip off�
You have to scrape it off� You have to shower in a little
pod� The pod keeps the water you scrape off your skin
from drifting off in the air� If it drifted off, it might
cause problems� It might mess up the computers and
equipment inside the space station�


You can see that lots of things are different when
you live in space� That is why leaving the space station
and coming back to Earth can be hard� It takes time for
the **astronauts** to get used to Earth again� After months
in space, they struggle with the **gravity** on Earth� Their
arms and legs feel heavy� They find it hard to stand up�
They feel off balance� But in a few weeks, they begin to
feel normal again� Sometimes when they look up at the
sky, they even feel a little homesick for their home in
outer space�

**Chapter**
# **14**


##### **Nicolaus** **Copernicus**



Do you remember in the very first chapter of this
reader you learned that long ago, people believed that
the sun moved around Earth? This seemed to make
sense� Each morning at the start of the day, the sun
rose in the east� At the end of the day, the sun set in the
west—exactly opposite from where it had come up� To
explain this change, people said the sun moved around
Earth� This is what the Greeks and other ancient people
believed� But you also learned in the first chapter that
this was not true�


About the same time that Christopher Columbus
arrived in America, a man named Nicolaus Copernicus
was studying math and astronomy at a university in
Poland� He later moved to Italy where he also studied
medicine and law�


91


_Young Copernicus studied math, astronomy, medicine, and law._



92


But Copernicus’ real love was astronomy� He knew
that since ancient times, people believed that the sun
moved around Earth� Copernicus began to carefully
observe and record the movement of the sun, **planets**,
and stars� After much research, Copernicus decided that
the belief that the sun moved around Earth could not
be true� Copernicus’ observations led him to believe just
the opposite! He realized that instead, Earth was moving
around the sun! He also believed that as Earth **orbited**
the sun, it also completed a full **rotation** each day�


All of Copernicus’ ideas came from viewing space
without the help of a telescope� He wrote down what he
observed from a cathedral bell tower� He also used math
to help him prove his point� Finally, Copernicus wrote
a book explaining his new ideas about how the universe
worked� His fellow scientists went to work trying to
prove him wrong, but they couldn’t� Most were amazed
by his discovery!


93


_Copernicus spent hours observing the movement of the stars,_
_planets, and sun._



94


However, Copernicus’ ideas were different from what
people had believed for thousands of years� They believed
that Earth and humans were the center of the universe�
Many of the teachings of the church at that time were
also based on this belief� Copernicus had suggested that
Earth was not the center of the universe� Instead, he said,
the sun was at the center! Some people disagreed with
Copernicus’ ideas and spoke out against them� So, his
beliefs were not widely accepted while he was alive�


After Copernicus died, other scientists and church
officials continued to argue against the view that the sun
was at the center of the universe� Some scientists agreed
with Copernicus’ ideas� Galileo agreed with Copernicus
and was punished and put in jail for a long time�


Today we know that Copernicus’s ideas led to our
current understanding of how the solar system works�
The sun is at the center, and the planets revolve around
it in elliptical orbits� His work led to other theories and
discoveries as well� Even today, scientists continue to
learn new things about the universe, so our knowledge is
always changing and growing�


95


_Copernicus argued that the sun, not Earth, was at the center of_
_the universe._
