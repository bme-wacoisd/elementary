## **The** **Skeletal System**



Hello! My name is Dr. Welbody. Some of you may
remember me. I visited your school once before. You
were in first grade then. We learned about some of the
systems that keep your body working. I told you to eat
healthy food so you would grow up to be big and strong.
It looks like you listened to me, too! I see that you have
grown a lot since then! You are getting big and tall!


I am here today to help you learn more about the
body and its systems. In the next few days we will learn
about three systems: the **skeletal system**, the **muscular**
**system**, and the **nervous system** .



2


_skeleton._



3


I’d like to begin with the **skeletal system** . The
**skeletal system** is made up of bones that give your body
shape.


I have a slideshow here on my computer. The first
slide shows the **skeletal system** . The picture on the
right shows what the **skeletal system** looks like from the
front. The one on the left shows what it looks like from
the side.


There are more than 200 bones in your body. When
I went to medical school to learn to be a doctor, I had to
learn the name of every bone in the body. I had to study
very hard!


You kids don’t need to be able to name every bone in
the body. But you should know the names of some of the
more important bones. So let’s get started!



4


_The_ _**skeletal system**_ _seen from the side and from the front_



5


Let’s start at the top, with the **skull** . Doctors call this
set of bones the **cranium** . The **skull**, or **cranium**, has a
very important job. It protects your brain.


You might think the **skull** is all one big bone. But



6


Rub the back of your neck. Can you feel the bone
that’s right at the base of your neck? That’s one of the
bones in your spine, or spinal column. The spine is a
chain of bones that runs down through your neck and
back. It runs from the base of the **skull** all the way down
to your hips (or **pelvis** ).


The spinal column is made up of more than thirty
smaller bones, stacked one on top of another. These
smaller bones are called **vertebrae** . The **vertebrae**


with spines, or
backbones,
are called
vertebrates.
That’s because
their spines are
made up of
**vertebrae** .



7


My next slide shows the bones inside your chest. If
you tap on your chest, right in the middle, you can feel
your breastbone. It’s also known as the **sternum** .


If you tap a bit to the left or the right, you may be
able to feel some of your ribs. The sternum and ribs
protect inner **organs** like the heart and lungs.


If you look at the slide, you can see why people
sometimes talk about “the rib cage.” The rib bones look
like the bars of a cage.


Do you see the two large bones behind the rib cage?
They are shaped like triangles. There’s one on each side.
These are your **shoulder blades** . The medical name for
the **shoulder blade** is the **scapula** .



8


I’ll be Simon.


Are you ready?



9


Simon says, tap your **skull** .


Simon says, now tap your **cranium** .


Ha! The **cranium** is the same thing as the **skull** . Did
I trick any of you?


Simon says, flex your **vertebrae** by bending over and
touching your **tibia** .


Simon says, take a deep breath and feel your rib cage
**expand** .


Simon says, put your **pelvis** to work and sit down.


Now, reach back and see if you can touch one of your
**scapulae**, or **shoulder blades** .


Wait! I didn’t say Simon says! Did I catch anyone?

**Chapter**
## **All About Bones**
# **2**

Last time, we learned the names of some of the bones
in the body. Today, I’d like to tell you a little more about
bones.


The bone I’m pointing to is the human fibula
bone. The fibula, you may recall, is one of the bones in
your leg.


The outer part of a bone is hard. It is made up of the
same stuff as a seashell you might find at the beach. That
stuff is called **calcium** .


Do you like milk? Milk and other **dairy** products like
cheese have lots of **calcium** in them. They are good for
your bones. One way to take good care of your bones
is to eat a healthy diet with **dairy** products and other
foods that provide **calcium** like beans and green leafy
vegetables.


12


_Dr. Welbody points to the fibula._



13


If you could look inside a bone, you’d see something
called bone **marrow** . Since you can’t see inside this bone,
I’ll show you a slide.


This slide shows bone **marrow** **cells** . I think you may
already know a little about **cells** . Is that right? If you
look at things with a strong microscope, you can see that
many things are made up of tiny **cells** . Your skin is made
of **cells** . So are your bones.


Here you can see some bone **marrow** **cells** . There are
millions of **cells** like these inside your bones. The bone
**marrow** **cells** have an important job. They are like little
factories. They produce red blood **cells** . Then, the red
blood **cells** carry oxygen all around the body.


14


_A view of bone_ _**marrow cells**_ _through a microscope_



15


As you get older and taller, your bones grow with
you. Bones are strong. They can support a great deal of
weight. However, if we put too much pressure on them,
or if the pressure comes from the wrong direction, bones
can break.


This next slide shows a broken bone. This is a special
kind of picture called an **x-ray** .



**X-rays** are part of the
invisible light spectrum. When
you aim **x-ray** light at your body,
some parts of the body absorb
a lot of **x-rays** and some do
not. Your bones are hard. They
absorb a lot of the **x-ray** light.
The soft **tissue** around your
bones absorbs less **x-ray** light.
That is why doctors like **x-rays** .
We can aim **x-rays** at a part of
your body and get a picture of
the inside of your body. We can
use **x-rays** to find out if any
bones are broken. You will learn
much more about **x-rays** in a
later unit about light and sound.


16



_An_ _**x-ray**_ _image of a_
_broken bone—do you_
_see exactly where the_
_bone is broken?_


Have any of you ever broken a bone?


I fix lots of broken bones each year. Would you like
to know how I do it?


I start by taking **x-rays** . That’s how I find out if the
bone is really broken. If the **x-rays** show that a bone is
broken, then I set the bone. That means I put the bone
pieces back in the right place. Once the bones are in the
right place, I put on a **cast** .


One of the remarkable things about the bones in
your body is that they are able to heal themselves. Once


good as new.


17


## **[The ]** **Muscular System**



**Chapter**


# **3**



Have you ever seen a movie or a TV show in which
skeletons chase people? I saw a cartoon like that the
other day. These kids were trying to solve a mystery but
they were having problems. Every time they went out to
look for clues, a skeleton would pop out of a grave and
chase them around.


Well, as a doctor, I have to tell you: that’s just not
very **realistic** . Bones don’t move all by themselves. In
fact, bones don’t go anywhere at all without **muscles** .


When I bend my arm, I do it by using **muscles** .
I tighten the **muscles** in my arm and the **muscles** make
the bones and the rest of the arm move.


When you kick a ball, it’s the same thing. You tighten
the **muscles** in your legs in order to move your leg
bones.


18


_Can a skeleton chase you?_



19


This slide shows you some of the **muscles** in the
muscular system. You can see that there are lots of
**muscles** in our bodies. There are about 650 **muscles**


20


Can you think of some?


**Muscles** help us run and jump. They allow us to
stand up and sit down. We use **muscles** when we lift
heavy objects. We also use them when we chew our
food and when we smile. We even use **muscles** when we
breathe.



21


Doctors divide **muscles** into two groups: **voluntary**
**muscles** and **involuntary muscles** . **Voluntary** **muscles**
are **muscles** that you can make move and control.
**Involuntary muscles** are **muscles** that you can’t control.
**Involuntary muscles** work without you even thinking
about them. These **muscles** work **automatically** .


The **muscles** that help you move your arms and legs
are **voluntary** **muscles** . When you want to pick up a
box, you think about it and then tighten the **muscles** in
your arms so you can lift the box. You can also control
the **muscles** in your legs when you want to make your
body run or jump.



22


_A human_ _**stomach**_


The **muscles** in your heart, however, are **involuntary**
**muscles** . They keep your heart beating, whether you are
awake or asleep. You don’t have to think, “It’s time to beat
again, heart!” These **muscles** work **automatically** .


There are **involuntary muscles** in your stomach, as well.
Your **stomach** muscles keep mixing and churning to help
**digest** your food without you reminding them to do the job.


23


**Chapter**


# **4**


## **[Joints ]** **and Muscles**



Does anyone know what we call the place where two
bones come together?


It’s called a **joint** .


You have lots of **joints** in your body. Your elbow is a
**joint** . So is your shoulder. So is your knee.


24


25


Many **joints** are cushioned by **cartilage** . **Cartilage**
is a **flexible**, **connective** tissue. It is not as hard as bone,
but it is stiffer and less **flexible** than muscle.


Do you remember when we learned about the
vertebrae—the bones that make up your spinal column?
Well, we have **cartilage** between each of the thirty or so
vertebrae in our spinal column. The **cartilage** cushions
the vertebrae and keeps them from rubbing against each
other. The **cartilage** is shown in red in the **model** on the
next page.


You also have **cartilage** in your ears. Grab the top
of your ear and bend it down a little. Now, let it go.
Do you feel how your ear snaps back into place when
you let go of it? It’s the **cartilage** that makes your ear
do that.

CARTILAGE


27


Some of the most important tissues in your body are
located at the **joints** .


A **ligament** is a kind of tissue that connects one bone
with another. Most of your **joints** contain **ligaments** .
You have **ligaments** in your knee, in your neck, and in
your wrists.


This slide shows **ligaments** in your knee. Can you
see how the **ligaments** connect your thigh bone to the
bones in your lower leg?


_**ligaments**_ _in red_


28


**Ligaments** connect bones to other bones. **Tendons**
connect muscles to bones.


I said earlier that the muscular system and the skeletal
system are connected. Well, **tendons** link these two
systems. **Tendons** connect muscles to bones and allow
you to move your bones.


One of the most famous **tendons** in the body is
called the **Achilles** [ə-KIL-eez] **tendon** . Does anyone
know where the **Achilles** **tendon** is?


That’s right! The **Achilles** **tendon** is in the back
of your leg, just above the heel. The **Achilles** **tendon**





29


The **Achilles tendon** is named for a famous Greek
**warrior** named **Achilles** . You may remember hearing
about the ancient Greeks when you were in second grade.


When **Achilles** was a baby, his mom tried to make
sure that he would never die. She had heard that a
person who had been dipped in the River Styx could
not be harmed by spears or arrows. She took her son
and dipped him in the river. Then, she felt better. She
believed that her son was **invulnerable** . Nothing could
harm him—or so she thought.


There was just one problem. When she dipped
**Achilles** in the river, she held him by his heel. So this
heel never got dipped in the river.


Many years later, during the **Trojan** War, a **Trojan**
**warrior** shot an arrow at **Achilles** . The arrow landed
right above **Achilles** ’ **s** heel—the very spot that had not
been dipped into the River Styx. **Achilles** died from
his wound.


So now you know why the **Achilles tendon** is
named for **Achilles** . This **tendon** was the one spot
where the mighty **warrior** was **vulnerable** and could be
wounded.

## **The** **Nervous System**



The skeletal system is made up of bones. The
muscular system is made up of muscles. The nervous
system is made up of—you guessed it—nerves!


You have about 200 bones in your body. You have
about 650 muscles to help you move those bones
around. How many nerves do you think you have?


Ten? Nope. You have more than that.


Fifty? That’s still too low.


You have 100-200 nerves in your body.


32


33


Your nerves allow you to keep track of what’s
happening in the world around you. The nerves send
messages to the brain. Then, the brain tells your body
how to act.


Have you ever walked outside and felt a chill that
sent you back inside to get a coat? What happened was
the nerves in your skin sent a message to your brain. The
message was, “It’s cold out here!”


Have you ever touched something hot? Chances are
you pulled your hand away pretty quickly. That’s because
your nerves sent a message to your brain.


Nerves are important for our sense of touch. Without
nerves, we couldn’t feel heat or cold. We couldn’t touch
things and find out if they are smooth or rough.


Nerves are important for our other senses, too.
Without nerves, we couldn’t see or hear. We couldn’t
smell or taste our food.


34


_The nervous system with a signal traveling along the nerves to_
_the brain_



35


The nerves in your body are made up of nerve cells.
A single nerve contains many nerve cells.


Here is an illustration of nerve cells. You can see that
nerve cells have long stringy parts that lead away from
the center. The center of the cell is called the **cell body** .
The branches of the nerve cell that receive information
from other nerve cells are called **dendrites** .


Imagine that you want to send a letter to your aunt
who lives in another town. Someone will have to put the
letter in a car or truck and drive it to your aunt’s house.
You might do this yourself. You might pay the post office
to do it. When one of the nerves in your body wants to
send a message to your brain, it sends the message out
along the axons. An axon is a long cable that winds away
from from the cell body. The message travels along the
axons, much as a car or truck travels along a road. The
axons transmit the message and the **dendrites** receive it.


36


_The stringy parts that lead away from the_ _**cell body**_ _are called_
_**dendrites**_ _._



37


Has your family doctor ever tapped you on the knee
with a little rubber hammer? Did you ever wonder why
he did that?


What your doctor is doing is checking your **reflexes**   which is another way of checking your nerves.


A **reflex** is something the body does without us even
thinking about it. If someone jumps out of a closet at
you, you may **flinch** . You will tighten up the muscles in
your body, just in case the person is trying to hurt you.
This is a **reflex** . When you pull away from a hot stove,
that is also a **reflex** .


When your doctor taps your knee, he’s looking for
a **reflex** reaction. If your leg moves a little, that’s a sign
that your nervous system is working as it should.

_his nerves._

## **The Spinal Cord** **and Brain**



You’ve got a lot of nerves! Really, you do!


You have nerves in your fingers. You have nerves in
your toes. There are nerves all over your body. But there
are two parts of your body that are especially important
for your nervous system. One is the spinal cord. The
other is the brain.


40


41


I told you a little about the spinal cord earlier, when
we were looking at the skeletal system. I told you that
the bones that make up your spine—the vertebrae—
are there to protect your spinal cord. The vertebrae
are **hollow** and long strings of nerves run through the
**hollow** parts of the bones. The nerves that make up the
spinal cord run all the way up your back and neck. They
end up in the brain.


If I were to have a serious accident and damage
my spinal cord, I might end up **paralyzed** —unable
to move my legs and/or my arms. I might need to
use a wheelchair to get around, like the boy in this
photograph. Some diseases also affect the spinal cord
and can result in the use of a wheelchair or powerchair.
A powerchair is a wheelchair that is battery powered to
assist the person in moving their chair.


You see, the brain uses the spinal cord as a sort of
super-highway to send and receive messages to and
from the rest of the body. If the spinal cord is broken,
or damaged, the messages can’t get through to the arms
and legs.


42


_cords, which impacts how they move._



43


The spinal cord leads right to the center of your
nervous system—your brain. It’s the brain that receives
messages from the nerves. It’s the brain that sends
messages out to your muscles. Even though the brain
weighs only 2–3 pounds, it is the most important organ
for life.


The brain is protected by the skull. Inside the skull,
there are three layers of fiber and fluid protecting the
brain. So, the brain is really well-protected. But it
can still be harmed. Ask a football player who’s had a
**concussion** . Getting a **concussion** is like bruising the
brain. Ouch!


_The human brain_


44


has its own job to do.


The **medulla**, or “brain stem,” is located at the base
of the skull in the back, right where the spinal cord
meets the brain.


The **medulla** controls the important involuntary
actions of the body, like breathing, heartbeat, and
digestion.



45


The **cerebellum** sits right next to the **medulla** . It is
divided into two **hemispheres** or halves. The **cerebellum**
has several jobs. One of them is to control voluntary
movements. That means the **cerebellum** helps you walk,
run, and jump.


The two **hemispheres** of the **cerebellum** control
different parts of the body. The right **hemisphere**
controls movement on the left side of the body. The
left **hemisphere** controls movement on the right side.
It might seem strange that the left side of the brain
controls the right side of the body, but that’s just the way
we’re made.


46


_The_ _**hemispheres**_ _of the_ _**cerebrum**_ _and the_ _**cerebellum**_



47


The third part of the brain is the **cerebrum** . The
**cerebrum** sits on top of the **cerebellum** and the
**medulla** . It is the largest part of the brain.


Each part of the **cerebrum** has a certain job to do.
For example, the front part just inside your forehead
controls emotions. The very back part just above the
brain stem controls the sense of sight. The sense of touch
is controlled by a strip of the brain running over the top
of your head from ear to ear.



48


The outside part of the **cerebrum** is called the
**cerebral cortex** . The **cerebral cortex** is the wrinkly part
of the brain that most people think about when they
think of a brain. People sometimes call this part of the
brain “the gray matter.”



49


The **cerebrum** is divided into two **hemispheres**, just
like the **cerebellum** . Until recently, we did not know
much about what the various parts of the **cerebrum** do.
But in the past few decades, we have learned a lot.


Scientists now have even more advanced ways than
just x-rays to look at and observe different organs in the
body, including the brain. They use something called
a PET scan to see different parts of the brain work.
A scientist may ask the person having the PET scan to
do something like talk or blink his or her eyes. When
the person performs different actions, different parts of
the brain light up on the computer screen. Scientists
have learned a lot about what happens where in the
brain by looking at PET scans. As you can see from this
model of the brain, some of the things we do take place
in the left **hemisphere**, while others happen in the right
**hemisphere** .

## **Eyes** **and Vision**



For the past few days I have been talking to you
about the body and its systems. Your teacher asked me
if I could also tell you something about **vision** and
hearing.


I told her I could. I know a little about **vision** and
a little about hearing, but I am not an expert on either
one. So, I told her I would bring in some friends of mine
who know more about these subjects.


I have one of those friends with me today. His name
is Dr. Kwan Si-Yu. He is a special kind of eye doctor
called an optometrist. He can tell you all about the eyes
and how they work.


52


_Dr. Welbody introduces Dr. Kwan Si-Yu._



53


Hello, I am Dr. Kwan Si-Yu. Are you ready to learn
all about eyes?


Good!


The human eye has several parts. I’d like to start by
showing you two parts you can see easily.


In the images on the right, you can see what eyes
look like up close. The **pupil** is the black part in the
center of the eye. The **iris** is the colorful part of the eye
that surrounds the **pupil** .


The **iris** can be different colors. Some of you may
have green eyes or brown eyes. When we say that a
person has green eyes or brown eyes, it’s his or her **irises**
we are talking about.


The **pupil** is not as colorful as the **iris** . It is always
black, but it changes size. When it is dark, the **pupil** gets
bigger to let more light in. When it is very bright and
sunny, the **pupil** shrinks to let less light in. How much
light will be let into the inside of your eye depends on
the size of the **pupil** .


54


_The top picture shows a large_ _**pupil**_ _, which is letting more light_
_in. The bottom picture shows a small_ _**pupil**_ _, which is letting less_
_light in._



55


Now, let’s learn about some parts of the eye that you
can’t see just by looking at a person’s face.


The picture on the next page shows some parts of the
eye as they would look if you could see inside a person’s
head. You are looking at them from the side.


You can see the **iris** and the **pupil** . There are also
some other parts shown.


   - The **cornea** is a thin, clear tissue that covers the
colored part of the eye. It helps protect the eye
from dirt and germs.


   - The **lens** is the part of your eye that focuses
light. The **lenses** in your eyes curve outward.


   - The **retina** is made of a special kind of tissue
that is very sensitive to light. Light from the **lens**
falls on the **retina** . Then, nerves in the **retina**
send messages to the brain.


   - These messages travel down a nerve called the
**optic nerve** .


56


_The human eye_







57


Now, let’s see how all of these parts work together so
you can see things. You may be surprised to learn that
the eye does not really see objects. Instead, it sees the
light that reflects off objects.


Light passes into the eye—first through the **cornea**,
and then through the **pupil** . If it’s dark, the **pupil**
expands to let more light in. If it’s bright, the **pupil** gets
smaller to let less light in. When a doctor shines a light
in your eyes, she is watching to see if your **pupils** change
size.


Next, the light passes through the **lens**, which focuses
the light and projects it onto the **retina** .


The **retina** is lined with special cells called **rods and**
**cones** . These are special kinds of nerve cells that sense
light. The **rods and cones** send information to the brain,
using the **optic nerve** .


All of this happens very quickly—so quickly that it
seems like you see things at the exact moment you look
at them. In reality, though, you are seeing them a split
second later.


The brain combines the information passed through
the **optic nerve** of each eye to make one image. That is
when you “see” the object.


58

## **Ears** **and Hearing**



Boys and girls, today you are going to learn about the
sense of hearing. I’m an expert on eyes and vision, but
not on ears and hearing.


That’s why I brought in a friend of mine. This is
Dr. Audit. She is an ear doctor. She will tell you all sorts
of interesting things about your ears!


So please welcome Dr. Kim Audit.


Hi! Can you all hear me?


You can? Well, then, tell your ears thanks! Your ears
work for you all day long. They tune into all kinds of
sounds. They help you learn during school. They help
you stay safe on the playground. When was the last time
you thanked your ears for all the help they give you?


60


_Dr. Kwan Si-Yu introduces Dr. Kim Audit._



61


I’m here to teach you about ears and hearing. But I’d
like to start by using this drum to tell you about sound
waves. Let me give it a couple of taps.


A drum is just a thin **membrane**, or skin, that’s been
pulled tight over a frame. When you hit a drum, the
**membrane** begins to **vibrate** . To **vibrate** means to move
back and forth rapidly. The **vibrations** of the drum
create **vibrations** in the air. The **vibrations** in the air are
called sound waves!


62


_Dr. Audit demonstrates_ _**vibration**_ _._

Now back to your ears. Your ears are made up of
three parts: the **outer ear**, the **middle ear**, and the
**inner ear** .


The part of your ear that you see on the side of your
head is called the **outer ear** . The **outer ear** is made of
cartilage and fat. The **outer ear** may look funny, but its
shape is a good one for catching sounds. That’s really the
**outer ear’s** main job—to catch sounds and guide them
into the **middle ear** .


The **outer ear** has an opening in it called the ear
canal. The ear canal is a tube that lets sound enter
your skull.


The ear canal is lined with hairs and **glands** that
produce ear wax. Ear wax helps to protect the ear. It also
helps keep germs out of your ears.


The ear canal leads to the **eardrum** . The **eardrum**
is a lot like the drum I brought in today. It has a thin
**membrane** that is stretched tightly across the ear canal.
When sound waves reach the **eardrum**, they make the
**eardrum** vibrate.


64


|EAR CANAL|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|EARDRUM|EARDRUM|EARDRUM|
|||INNER EAR|



65


The **middle ear** is made up of three small bones with
funny names: the hammer, the anvil, and the stirrup.
These bones are named for things they look like. One
looks like a hammer. Another looks like an anvil—the
piece of iron on which a blacksmith bangs hot metal into
shape. The last one looks like a stirrup that you put your
foot in when you are mounting a horse.


These bones are very tiny. The stirrup is the size of a
grain of sand. It is the smallest bone in the body.


All three bones are very **sensitive** to sound waves.
They vibrate when they are struck by sound waves and
they pass vibrations to a part in the **inner ear** called the
**cochlea** .


The **cochlea** is a fluid-filled coil, shaped like a snail’s
shell. It is lined with hairs, which are connected to nerves.
Sound waves from the **middle ear** make these hairs
vibrate. Then, the nerves connected to the hairs send
messages to the brain through the **auditory nerve** . That’s
how your ears let you hear what I’m saying.


66


67


Hearing is pretty amazing if you think about it.
When I hit this drum, the sound waves travel across
the room. Some of those waves enter your **outer ear**
and are guided down the ear canal to your **eardrum** .
The sound waves make your **eardrum** **vibrate** . The
vibrating **eardrum** makes the tiny bones in your **middle**
**ear vibrate** and these bones make the tiny hairs in your
**cochlea** **vibrate** . Then, the nerves attached to these hairs
send messages to your brain. All of this happens quicker
than the time it just took you to read this sentence!

## **Beyond Sight and** **Sound,**

**Part I**



Last time, I told you a little bit about hearing.
Earlier, Dr. Si-Yu told you about eyes and vision. Today,
I would like you to think about what it would be like if
you couldn’t hear or couldn’t see.


Millions of people live with poor hearing or with no
hearing at all. These people are **deaf** or hard of hearing.


Imagine, if you can, what it would be like to be
completely **deaf** . How would you know what other
people are saying? After all, you could not hear their
words.


Many **Deaf** people use sign language. Sign language
is a way to communicate without speaking. One person
makes signs with her hands that stand for words and
letters. The other person sees the signs and understands
the message. The two women in this picture are using
sign language.


70


_Dr. Audit talks about sign language._



71


Did you know that there is a **gesture** or sign in
American Sign Language for each letter in the alphabet?
See if you can spell out your name using the signs shown
on the next page.


Sign language is one way **Deaf** people can
communicate. There are also other ways. Some **Deaf**
people can read lips. That means they carefully watch
a person’s lips move as he is speaking. They can tell
what the person is saying by looking at how his lips
are moving.


How? A person’s lips take on different shapes and
positions as he says different sounds. Try looking in the
mirror sometime while you are talking to see how your
lips move. Someone who reads lips translates what a
person is saying by studying the different shapes and
positions of his lips. Isn’t that amazing?


It takes much time and practice to learn how to use
sign language and how to read lips.


72


73


Now, I’d like you to try to think what life would be
like if you could not see. What would it be like to be
**blind** ? How would you find your way around? How
would you read?


People who are **blind** find ways to live with their
**disability** . Many **blind** and visually impaired people use
a cane to help them get around. By tapping in front of
them, they can tell where there are walls. They can tell
when they need to step up and when they need to step
down.


74


_A_ _**blind**_ _man walks with a special cane._



75


Some **blind** and visually impaired people use seeing-eye
dogs to help them get around. These dogs are also known
as guide dogs. They are specially trained to help **blind** and
visually impaired people get from place to place safely.


_A guide dog helps a blind person get around._


76


_A_ _**blind**_ _person reads braille._


**Blind** and visually impaired people can also learn to
use their other senses to make up for their inability to
see. A **blind** and visually impaired person can’t tell what
you look like, but he or she may be able to recognize
you by your voice.


**Blind** people can also learn to read using a system
called braille. In the braille system, raised bumps that a
person can feel are used to stand for letters. A **blind** reader
touches and runs her fingers over the dots and recognizes
letters. Then, she thinks of the sounds the letters stand for
and blends the sounds together to read. Like lip reading
or using sign language, it takes lots of time and practice to
learn how to read using braille.

**Part II**



People with disabilities face extra **challenges** in life.
However, these disabilities don’t keep **determined** people
from doing amazing things.


This is a painting of the musician Ray Charles. Ray
Charles went **blind** when he was seven years old. He
couldn’t see, but there was nothing wrong with his ears.
He loved music and decided to become a musician. He
learned to sing and play the piano. Eventually, he became
one of the most popular musicians of his day.


Ray Charles won ten Grammy Awards and made
millions of dollars as a singer. He did not let his
**disability** hold him back.

This next image shows a girl named Helen Keller.
Helen Keller lost both her sight and her hearing from a
serious illness when she was just nineteen months old.
She was **deaf** and **blind** for the rest of her life.


As a young girl, Helen Keller could not hear or speak.
She learned to communicate a few ideas by making
gestures. When she wanted her mother, she would grab
and pull her mother to her. When she wanted to be
alone, she would push her mom away. She could nod her
head to say yes or shake it to say no. When she wanted
toast, she would make a gesture as if she was spreading
butter on bread.


There were a few ideas she could communicate. Yet
there were many things she could not get across with
gestures. As a child, she would often try to communicate
and fail. Then, she would get angry and cry. Sometimes
she would have terrible temper tantrums. She wanted,
more than anything, to communicate with people. She
was not able to do so.


80


_Helen Keller as a child_



81


Helen’s parents were worried about her. They did not
know how to help her communicate. Since she was **deaf**
and **blind**, she could not attend school. So, her parents
searched and found a special teacher who came to live with
them. The teacher’s name was Annie Sullivan.


Annie Sullivan wanted to teach Helen to understand
words but how can you understand words if you can’t
hear them? Sullivan started by giving Helen a doll to
hold. Then, she took Helen by the hand and traced the
letters d-o-l-l on her palm. She did this over and over.
After a while, Helen learned to write the letters d-o-l-l on
a page. She did not know that she had written a word.
She did not even know that words existed. But she felt
proud that she could imitate what her teacher was doing.


Her teacher, Annie Sullivan, traced more words on
Helen’s palm. She learned to spell _pin_, _hat_, _cup_, and a few
other words. The real **breakthrough** happened when
Annie tried to teach Helen the word _water_ . Sullivan took
Helen outside to a well. She placed one of Helen’s hands
under the spout and spelled w-a-t-e-r on her other palm.
Suddenly, something seemed to click in Helen’s head. She
understood that w-a-t-e-r meant the “wonderful, cool
something” that was flowing over her hand.


82


_Helen Keller with her teacher, Annie Sullivan_



83


Helen soon learned more words. When she was eight,
she went to a special school for the **blind** . Sullivan went
with her. Later, she went to a school for the **Deaf** . But
she didn’t stop there. She went on to Radcliffe College,
where she became the first **deaf** and **blind** person to
receive a college degree.


Helen learned to speak and she learned to read lips
with her fingers. She learned to read, using braille. She
wrote books, including a biography of her own life,
_The Story of My Life_ . She was active in politics and
fought for women to have the right to vote.


Helen Keller lived a long and productive life. She
died in 1968 at the age of 87.


In 2003, the state of Alabama honored Helen Keller
by putting an image of her on their state quarter. The
quarter pays **tribute** to Helen’s **courage** in overcoming
her **disabilities** and inspiring millions of people.

## **Vision Problems,** **Vision Solutions**



Last time, I showed you some parts of the eye and
explained how those parts work together to help us see.
Today, I want to talk about some things that can go
wrong with our vision and also some ways we can fix
vision problems.


A lot of vision problems have to do with the lens of
the eye. The lens of your eye is curved outward. The lens
of your eye bends the light rays closer together to focus
the light on the retina.


The image on the right shows two rays of light
entering the eye as they pass through the cornea and
lens. The cornea and the lens bend the light rays so that
they meet and touch the retina at the same spot. You
have perfect vision.


86


_How your eye bends light when the cornea is shaped correctly_



87


Sometimes, however, the cornea of the eye may not
be shaped correctly. When this happens, your vision will
not be perfect. This slide shows what happens when a
cornea is not shaped correctly. This time, the light rays
passing through the lens meet before they touch the
retina. Then, they hit different places on the retina. This
means that this person is **nearsighted** . She can see things
that are close by, but things that are farther away will
look blurry and out of focus.


A long time ago, there was no way to help a
**nearsighted** person. That is no longer the case. Today, we
have several ways to help a person who is **nearsighted** .


_How your eye bends light when the cornea is not shaped correctly_


88


An optometrist can examine and measure the lenses
of the eyes. If they are not shaped correctly, he can write
a **prescription** for a pair of glasses with special lenses. An
**optician** then makes these lenses and glasses.


My next slide shows how glasses with special lenses
can correct **nearsighted** vision. Again, you can see the
two rays of light. But here you can see that a lens that
curves inward has been placed in front of the eye. (This
lens is in a pair of glasses the person is wearing.) Now,
before the light enters the eye, the lens bends the light a
little differently. As a result, when the rays pass through
the eye’s cornea and lens, they now touch the retina at
the same spot.


_How corrective lenses help your eye bend light correctly_


89


We can make different glasses for lots of different
kinds of vision problems. There are lenses that help a
**nearsighted** person see things that are far away. There
are other kinds of lenses that help a **farsighted** person
see things up close.


Do you know anyone who wears **contact lenses** ?
**Contact lenses** work the same way as glasses. The only
difference is that you place the lens in your eye, right on
top of your cornea.


In this slide, you can see a girl getting ready to **insert**
a **contact lens** . Once she puts it in, it will cover her iris
and her pupil. It will be almost invisible. You will not see
it unless you look very closely.


_A girl about to_ _**insert**_ _a_ _**contact lens**_ _into her eye_


_The_ _**LASIK**_ _procedure_


There is another way to solve vision problems. It’s
called **LASIK surgery** . When you have **LASIK surgery**,
the doctor uses a **laser beam** to change the shape of the
cornea of your eye. Once your cornea is fixed, you may
not need to wear glasses or **contact lenses** .

## **The** **Skeletal System**
#####  Reader’s Theater





92


**Narrator**

Welcome to the Human Body Network. Today, we
are visiting Mrs. Bones’ third-grade class as they learn
about the skeletal system.


**Mrs. Bones**

Good morning, everyone. We have a special visitor
today named Dr. Welbody. Some of you may
remember her. She visited your classroom when you
were in first grade.


**Dr. Welbody**

Hello! My name is Dr. Welbody. I visited your
school a few years ago. We learned about some of the
systems that keep your body working.


**Everyone**

Hello! Hello!


93


**Dr. Welbody**

Well, let’s begin. The skeletal system is made up of
bones. There are more than 200 bones in your body.
You kids don’t need to be able to name every bone in
the body. But you should know the names of some of
the most important bones. So let’s get started!


**Student 1 (tapping her head)**

What is the name of the bone that makes up my
head?


**Dr. Welbody**

Good question! Your skull is made up of more than
one bone. Doctors call this set of bones the cranium.


**Student 2**

The cranium? That’s a funny name. How will I
remember that name?


**Dr. Welbody**

Try this: The cranium protects your brain, right?


94


**Student 3**

I guess so.


**Dr. Welbody**

And the word cranium sounds like the word brain.
The CRAN-ium protects your BRAIN-ium!


**Everyone (giggling)**

The CRAN-ium protects your BRAIN-ium.


**Narrator**

Dr. Welbody and Mrs. Bones are great teachers. The
class is learning a lot today!


**Dr. Welbody**

That was easy!


**Student 4 (tapping his chest)**

What about this bone right here in the middle of my
chest? What is its name?


95


**Dr. Welbody**

The sternum. Say it with me—sternum.


**Student 5**

That’s a hard word to remember. Do you have a trick
to help us?


**Dr. Welbody**

Try this poem:


_Be glad your sternum’s on the inside,_

_That really is the best._

_For if it were on the outside,_

_You’d have a bony chest!_

**Everyone (giggling)**

Say it again, say it again!


96


**Narrator**

I wish I were a third grader today!


**Student 6**

What about the bones in my legs? What are they
called?


**Dr. Welbody**

The two bones in your lower leg are called the tibia
and the fibula. The tibia is the larger of the two.


**Student 7**

I bet you have a trick for us to help us remember,
don’t you?



97


**Dr. Welbody (chuckling)**

Yes, I do! You see in your reader that one of the bones
is larger than the other. Well, here goes—a fib is a
little lie and the fibula is the little leg bone. How
about that?


**Everyone**

We loved your visit! Hooray for Dr. Welbody’s tricks
and for Mrs. Bones’ bones!


**Narrator**

Thanks for tuning into the Human Body Network
today. We hope you learned a lot about bones. Tune
in again soon!
