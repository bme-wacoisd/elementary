**Grade 3 | Unit 7**
###### Introduction


~~**NATIVE AMERICAN REGIONS AND CULTURES**~~


This introduction includes the necessary background information to teach the _Native American_
_Regions and Cultures_ unit. This unit contains 13 daily lessons, plus two Pausing Point days that may
be used for differentiated instruction. Each lesson will require a total of 120 minutes. Lesson 13
contains the Unit Assessment.


As noted, two days are intended to be used as Pausing Point days. These Pausing Points are
embedded into the instruction at appropriate points, with the first one after Lesson 7 and the
second after Lesson 12. You may choose to continue to the next lesson and schedule the first
Pausing Point day for another day in the unit sequence. Pausing Points can be used to focus on
content understanding, writing, spelling, grammar, morphology skills, or fluency.


~~**FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS**~~


**Reading**


The Reader for Unit 7, _Native American Stories,_ consists of selections describing the historical
events and culture of Native Americans. These selections are realistic fictional accounts with the
purpose of conveying nonfiction information about several Native American cultures. Students will
read how Native Americans spread through the continents, changing their ways of life as they did so.
They will read about Native Americans who settled in the Greater Mississippi River areas as well as
in the Southwest, Northeast, Southeast, and Arctic/Subarctic.


**Spelling**


During this unit’s spelling exercises, students will review words with /ə/ spelled ‘a’ and ‘e’ and those
words with /ə/ spelled ‘al,’ ‘le,’ and ‘el,’ and /sh/ + /ə/ + /n/ spelled ‘tion.’ Challenge Words and
Content Words continue.


Introduction
**1**


**2**



**Grammar**


In the grammar section, students will be introduced to possessive nouns and pronouns, plural
possessive nouns not ending in ‘s’ or ‘es,’ and will review singular and plural possessive nouns.
Students will also learn the difference between the possessive pronoun _its_ and the contraction _it’s_ .


**Morphology**


Throughout Grade 3, students will study word parts, such as prefixes, suffixes, and root words
during the morphology portion of the lessons. In this unit, students will learn the suffixes _–ish,_
_–ness, –able,_ and _–ible._


**Dictionary**


Students will continue to practice dictionary skills. In this unit, they will use a student dictionary to
determine key words, review the function of entry words, and learn about homographs.


~~**WHY THE NATIVE AMERICAN REGIONS AND CULTURES UNIT IS IMPORTANT**~~


This unit reviews what students have already learned in previous grades about the first known
inhabitants of North America. Students will learn more in-depth information about how some
Native Americans first migrated from Asia to North America, how many scientists think they spread
throughout the continents of North America and South America, and how their ways of obtaining
food changed over the years. Furthermore, students will learn details about how people adapted to
the environment of the region in which they settled and how that adaptation shaped their cultural
identity. When teaching this unit, it is important to ensure students know that while we are learning
about different Native American nations in history, there are many that are still thriving today.


The content students learn in Grade 3 will serve as the basis for more in-depth study in the later
grades of other groups of Native Americans who have lived, and continue to live, in various parts of
North America.


The text that students will be reading and discussing in this unit provides opportunities for students
to build content knowledge and draw connections to Social Studies. You may build on class
discussions to support students in making cross-curricular connections to the strands of Culture,
Geography, History and Social Studies Skills from the Social Studies TEKS. This content is not a
replacement for grade-level social studies instruction. For more information about the quantitative
and qualitative measures used to determine the complexity of the texts, see the Measures of Text
Complexity in the Teacher Resources.


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures


**Prior Knowledge**


Students who have received instruction in the program in Grades 1–2 will already have pertinent
background knowledge for this unit. For students who have not received prior instruction in the
program, introductory knowledge is addressed at the beginning of each unit.


Early American Civilizations : Aztecs, Maya, Incas (Grade 1)


Ancient Greeks: Life, Tradition, and Government (Grade 2)


Stories of the Ancient Greeks (Grade 2)


Land of Opportunity (Grade 2)


Introduction

**4**



~~**WRITING**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


Students have many opportunities to write in a variety of ways and for different purposes. Everyday
writing opportunities come in many forms, including: maintaining a “unit dictionary” notebook
containing definitions, sentences, and/or other writing exercises that use Core Vocabulary Words;
Quick Writes; written response to illustrations and to prompts requiring comprehension of key
elements of stories from unit readings; Journal entries; “Around the Table” writing/sharing activities;
written responses requiring recall and comprehension of text; and various extended written
responses. Students will also use graphic organizers to gather and categorize information from
reading or from the Read-Aloud, or to plan for writing. Many writing lessons provide opportunities
for students to collaborate, share ideas, and give feedback on their writing.


In Grade 3, students will write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving
appropriate spaces between words. In order to master these skills, encourage students to complete
activities in cursive throughout the unit.


~~**PERFORMANCE TASKS AND ASSESSMENTS**~~


The Primary Focus objectives in each lesson are carefully structured and sequenced throughout the
unit to help build student understanding. Additionally, formative assessments are provided to help
keep track of their progress towards objectives and standards. These can be found in the Student
Activity Book and are referenced in every lesson.


The Native American Regions and Cultures unit will end with a Unit Assessment that will cover the
content of the unit and reading objectives taught throughout the unit, as well as a grammar and
morphology assessment.


~~**FLUENCY SUPPLEMENT**~~


A separate component, the Fluency Supplement, is available in the program’s online materials. This
component was created to accompany materials for Grade 3. It consists of selections from a variety
of genres, including poetry, folklore, and fables. These selections provide additional opportunities
for students to practice reading with fluency and expression (prosody). For more information on
implementation, please consult the supplement.


**TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.

   - Station 1: Native Americans of the Greater Mississippi


    - Items at this station may include: fruits, berries, pottery in the shape of
animals, and pictures of burial mounds and fish.


   - Station 2: Southwest Native Americans


    - Items at this station may include: corn, squash, sticks, weaved basket,
and pictures of a pit house, turkeys, and adobe.


   - Station 3: Northeast Native Americans


    - Items at this station may include: squash, sunflowers, corn, maple
syrup, and pictures of longhouses and wigwams.


   - Station 4: Southeast Native Americans


    - Items at this station may include: sunflowers, corn, copper, shells, and
pictures of deer, rabbits, raccoons, and turkeys.


   - Station 5: Arctic


    - Items at this station may include: driftwood and pictures of whales,
igloos, fish, walrus, seals, a kayak, and dog sleds.


 - Identify Image Cards C.U7.L1.1 and C.U7.L1.2


**Speaking and Listening**

 - Identify the following Digital Images online to project during the Read-Aloud:
U7.L1.1–U7.L1.8.


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures

  - The decodable passage for this lesson, “Etu and the Mammoth Hunt,” can be
found in the Teacher Resources section. You will use the passage to practice
the decoding skills taught in this lesson during small-group instruction,
partner work, or independent reading. As students read, circulate and
provide immediate, corrective feedback.

**Universal Access**

  - Ask students what they already know about Native Americans.


    - What have you learned before? Students can take turns coming up to
the board; they will write anything they know about Native Americans,
whether it is one word like “Inuit” or “Algonquin” or “tipis.” This will help
the teacher understand what students know and identify misconceptions
students have about Native Americans that can be corrected during the
lesson. After students complete the Artifact stations, the class can identify
that they now know more than they did at the beginning of class.


    - Next, ask students what _cause_ and _effect_ mean. Tell them that they will be
reading an informational text and focusing on cause and effect.


    - Explain that this lesson will be discussing how Native Americans changed
the way they lived. Have students search for the cause as they read.
Explain to students that there are over five hundred federally recognized
Native American tribes. We will only be learning about a few in this section.
Tell students to keep in mind that each tribe was unique in their own way.


Lesson 1 Spreading through the Continents

- Ask students if they like to travel. Ask if they like to stay at home and
settle in. Tell them that in this lesson, they will talk about how the Native
Americans’ way of life changed. Have students raise their hand if they have
ever heard the word _migratory_ .


- Explain that in this lesson, students will hear the word _migratory_, which
relates to people or animals who move from place to place for various
reasons, often in groups. While some Native American groups migrated
between places, they mostly did so intentionally. This means that they
would move between different locations for specific reasons. Some Native
groups would move based on the season, following seasonal or migrating
food sources, and had homes in different places. Some would follow
seasonal or migrating food sources. Some Native Americans, however,
changed their way of life and stopped migrating, choosing to stay in one
place. What caused this change? Today this will be investigated!

**Primary Focus:** Students will identify North America, South America, and Asia on

a map. ~~**[ TEKS 3.1.A; TEKS 3.6.H ]**~~


~~**INTRODUCING THE UNIT (30 MIN.)**~~


  - Artifact Hunt (timed rotations of five minutes): Explain to students that five
stations have been set up around the room that represent different Native
American tribes. Each student group will stop at each station for five minutes
to explore the images and artifacts before rotating to the next station.
Students will complete Activity Page 1.1 to record what they identified at
each station. In small groups, students will identify and discuss the items at
each station.


  - Write on the board: _Native Americans_ . Ask, “Who can tell me about the
people called Native Americans after the Artifact Hunt?”


» earliest known residents of the continent of North America


  - Tell students that they are going to learn how the Native Americans first
arrived on the continent of North America thousands of years ago, how they
lived when they first arrived, how they adjusted to different environments,
and how, over time, they started to form tribes with other people who shared
similar languages, customs, beliefs, and traditions. Tribes were likely also
formed by people with different customs due to conflict resolution, need, etc.
Tell students that while we are learning about the history and origin of some
tribes in this unit, there are many groups of Native Americans that are still
practicing their customs, beliefs, and traditions today.


  - Tell students that in this unit, they will see the word “Native” capitalized.
When this word is capitalized, with an uppercase _N_, it is referring to people
that belong to the ethnic group of Native Americans. This ethnic group
consists of ancestors of the people that first inhabited the Americas.
In contrast, when you see the word native, with a lowercase _n_, this word
describes being the place or environment in which a person was born. For
example, someone’s native language is the language spoken by their family
or country they were born in.


**TEKS 3.1.A** Listen actively, ask relevant questions to clarify information, and make pertinent comments; **TEKS 3.6.H**
Synthesize information to create new understanding.

- Show Image Card C.U7.L1.1. Tell students that long ago, certain parts of
the world looked very different from the way they do today. Explain that
long ago, large areas of the earth’s waters were frozen during the Ice Age.
Explain that an ice age is a time when large areas of land and water are
covered by thick ice. There have been a number of ice ages throughout
history, but when we talk about the Ice Age, we are talking about a major
event that occurred during a time that many scientists estimate began
millions of years ago and ended about 10,000 years ago.


- On a map or globe, direct students’ attention to Alaska. Then point to Asia
on the same map or globe, and ask students if they know which continent
that is.


- Next, show students Image Card C.U7.L1.1 (Beringia Migration), and direct
their attention to Alaska and Asia and the region in between (Beringia).
Tell them that this map shows the area between Asia and North America
as it looked thousands of years ago and the way it looks today. (Guide the
discussion until students understand that today, Alaska, which is on the
continent of North America, is separated from the continent of Asia by a body
of water. But thousands of years ago, the land connecting the two continents
was above water.)


- Compare Image Card C.U7.L1.1 (Beringia Migration) to Image Card C.U7.L1.2
(Native American Regions of North America). Explain that there is now water
(Bering Strait) where there once was land (Beringia).


- Explain that today, because the ice has melted and the sea levels have risen,
this landmass between Asia and North America is now beneath a body of
water known as the Bering Strait. Point to the Bering Strait on Image
Card C.U7.L1.2.

Students may also keep a “unit dictionary” notebook along with definitions,
sentences, and/or other writing exercises using these vocabulary words.

**migratory,** relating to people or animals who move from place to place for
various reasons, often in groups

**prey,** an animal that is hunted as food

**regions,** large spaces or geographic areas


**woolly mammoths,** large mammals, now extinct, that roamed parts of North
America and Asia and were hunted by the prehistoric people who migrated
from Asia to North America

 - Tell students to listen carefully to hear more about where the early settlers of
North America came from, how it is believed they got to this continent, how the
Ice Age is related to their migration, and how they lived when they first arrived.


 - Students will also be reading the text to determine the cause/effect events
in the Read-Aloud. Explain that many events in history have a cause/effect
relationship. The cause tells why something happens or the action and
the effect is what happened. We will be taking notes on Activity Page 1.2 to

paragraph:


**Show Image U7.L1.1**
People migrating across Beringia


I want you to imagine a time long,

long ago. In this ancient time, some

began to move from one land to





another. These **prehistoric** people



**16**



were **migratory** hunters who traveled in groups. These prehistoric

people began to move from the land we call Asia into the land we call

North America. It is believed today that groups of people ventured

between Asia and North America taking varying routes, through

different waves of migration. It is possible that people first came to

the Americas in boats, following the coastline in search of land and

food, and then stayed because they discovered an abundance of new

resources. The migration of people and animals did not happen all

at one time, nor did these people come from only one place. People

moved from across Asia into North America over a period of time.


**TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text.


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures


While some people now consider this theory to be outdated,

anthropologists once believed that groups of people ventured

on foot across a vast, cold area between Asia and North America

called Beringia, following herds of prehistoric animals. Some

anthropologists thought that the very beginning of this migration

of ancient Asian people began during the last major Ice Age. It was

during this Ice Age that large areas of the earth’s waters were frozen.

At this time, northern **regions** of North America were covered in

thick sheets of ice and giant, glistening glaciers. As you heard earlier,

because water had turned to ice during the Ice Age, sea levels had

dropped and certain areas of land had become uncovered. Many

scientists think Beringia was one of these areas. ~~Tell students that~~

~~we refer to the prehistoric people that migrated to North America as~~

~~“Natives” or “Native Americans” because they were the first people~~

~~to inhabit this continent.~~


- On Activity Page 1.2: As a whole group, have students identify the cause and
effect relationship in the paragraph.


» Cause: Native Americans followed herds of animals that they hunted; Effect:

people began to travel from Asia to North America


- Discuss the cause and effect relationship of these two events. What is
the action? (Native Americans followed herds of animals to hunt.) What
happened? (Native Americans traveled from Asia to North America.)


According to the Beringia land theory, as these prehistoric people

moved across Beringia, they lived and hunted in this icy world. There

they followed and hunted great herds of large mammals such as

**woolly mammoths**, mastodons, giant bison (different than the bison

of today), saber-toothed cats, and giant ground sloths. These large

mammals are known as big game. All of these animals were **prey** for

the people who migrated, or moved, from Asia to North America.

- Purpose for Listening: Have students listen for the cause/effect relationship
in the following paragraph:


Anthropologists once believed that eventually, as the weather began

to warm and the ice-covered land began to thaw, it became possible

to travel even farther into North America. Giant glaciers that had

blocked Native peoples’ paths melted. People moved south through

an area that opened up between two enormous glaciers. Scientists

call this path between these glaciers the Ice-Free Corridor. This

corridor, or passage, was cold and wet, but habitable.

**18**


And so, large numbers of Native peoples continued to migrate, or

move, in small groups just as before. They lived a migratory life as

they followed the herds of animals that they preyed upon. Some of

these Native groups had seasonal homes in different locations.


**Show Image U7.L1.3**
Man with spear and spear thrower

In order to survive in this way, these

Native peoples had to be expert





hunters. Although we do not know much

about this period of human history,



archaeologists have discovered a variety of spears, including leaf
shaped spears, **embedded** in mammoths’ bones, in addition to tools for

scraping and carving bone.


**Show Image U7.L1.4**
Prehistoric people utilizing parts of a
woolly mammoth


We can only imagine what life must

have been like for these early peoples





as they endeavored to survive in an

ice-cold world by hunting creatures



such as the nine-foot-tall woolly mammoth. With nothing more than

a spear and stealth, they would have hunted in groups to take down

their prey. A woolly mammoth would have provided many pounds of

meat, as well as fur, tusks, and bones. A band of hunters and their

families would most likely have stayed with the carcass, or dead body,

of the animal until the food supply ran out.


In addition to food, the animals they hunted provided these Native

people with clothes.

- Purpose for listening: Have students listen for cause/effect relationship in
the following paragraph:


As the earth’s weather patterns changed and it became warmer,

the way these early peoples lived changed, too. Gradually, many

prehistoric animals that had been hunted for their meat, fur, and

bones disappeared from our world forever. Were they hunted to

extinction by people struggling to survive in a changing world? Or, did

earth’s changing weather patterns alter the delicate balance of the

food chain to such an extent that these mammoths could no longer

find the foods they needed to live? We will never know for certain the

answer to these questions. We do know that the saber-toothed tiger

and the woolly mammoth no longer wander this land, whereas other

ancient creatures, such as the bison, did survive.


- On Activity Page 1.2: Have students identify the cause and effect relationship
in the paragraph.


» Cause: The earth’s weather patterns changed and became warmer; Effect: The

early people’s lives changed.


- Whole group: Discuss the cause and effect relationship of these two events.
What is the action? What was the result?


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures


Check for Understanding


If students could not identify the cause/effect relationship, then write
the following sentence on the board: “As the earth’s weather patterns
changed and it became warmer, the way these early peoples lived
changed.” Circle the cause and underline the effect in the sentence.


**Show Image U7.L1.6**
Modern American bison in grass


It does appear that some animals were

more able to **adapt** to earth’s changing

weather patterns than others. The





bison, for example, is thought to have



become smaller and swifter over time. Once the ice was gone, new

plants, grasses, and trees emerged, and various animals adapted to a

new diet. Native peoples adapted, too.


**Show Image U7.L1.7**
Plains, woodland, swamp, and desert


And so eventually, over many years,

people moved across this vast expanse

of land to various regions—to the wide





open grasslands of the Central Plains;

to the northeastern and southeastern woodlands, swamplands,

and coastal regions; and to the sun-drenched west coast and dry

southwestern deserts. Some people settled in the far north regions of

the arctic and subarctic. Some people moved even farther south, into

what we now call the continent of South America.

Pueblo people, whom you will learn about later in this unit. They

largely remained in one place and relied on farming. However,

eventually, many other migratory peoples changed their way of life

and also chose to settle in one place and establish permanent or

semi-permanent settlements. They may have decided this because

they discovered regions where the food supplies were plentiful in the

form of animals to hunt and fish and plants to consume. One thing

that is certain is that many Native people began to farm, though

they had previously survived by foraging for wild plants in addition

to hunting prey. Native people began experimenting with planting

and harvesting, and they eventually began to grow a variety of crops.

Because of this, some people chose to stay in one place and, by their

collective efforts, increase their own food supply.


Over time, approximately 500 North American Native tribes came to

inhabit a wide variety of regions across North America. These Native

peoples—whose total population peaked, or reached its highest

number, at about twenty million—had many different customs

and cultures that changed over time, including because of cultural

blending or because of warfare between groups.


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** We have been talking about prehistoric people. What does

_prehistoric_ mean?


» refers to someone or something that existed during a time before people started

writing down history


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures



**22**


2. **Inferential.** Did the people of Asia plan to migrate to the continent of

North America?


» no


Why did they most likely migrate across Beringia, according to scientists?


» They were following the herds of animals that were their prey.


3. **Evaluative.** _Think-Pair-Share:_ Would you prefer to live a migratory existence

or settle in a permanent community? Why?


» Answers may vary.


~~**WORD WORK: MIGRATORY (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _migratory_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity
for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed.
Review any obvious syllable patterns at this time.


2. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “These prehistoric people were migratory
hunters who traveled in groups.”


3. Say the word _migratory_ with me.


4. Migratory people are those who move from place to place, often in groups,
for various reasons.


5. Have you ever learned about _migratory_ people? Be sure to use the word
_migratory_ when you tell about it. (Ask two or three students. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses to make complete sentences:
“I learned about migratory people in .” or “The migratory people
of .”)


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _migratory_ ?


  - Use a Drawing activity for follow-up. Have students try to imagine migratory
people moving from place to place in search of food. Have them draw their
idea and then write a sentence beneath their drawing. Make sure that they
use the word _migratory_ in a complete sentence when they share.

  - Tell students that each number placed on the map shows where the
corresponding character’s chapter takes place.


  - Note for students that the chapters in _Native American Stories_ describe
events that would have happened a long time ago in these locations. Explain
to students that there are over 500 Native American tribes. While some have
shared experiences, they are each different in their own way. We will only
be hearing stories in this unit from some Native American tribes. It is also
important to note that while we will hear stories from people in the past,
there are many thriving Native American communities living today.


  - Next, use the map to guide students in thinking about how they may
potentially compare and contrast characters.

~~**WHOLE GROUP READING: “ETU, THE HUNTER” (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students they will be reading “Etu, the Hunter,” which is a work of
historical fiction, like most of the chapters in this Reader. Historical fiction
has two important features: the stories and characters are made up, but
the times and places were real. The real place in this chapter is the region of
North America called the Northwest. The real time is the Ice Age.


 - Ask students to turn to the map that they discussed on **page 5** .


 - Point out to students where Etu’s home is located on the map. (See **box 1** in
“Introduction to _Native American Stories_ .” The Northwest includes **number 1**
on the map in “Introduction to _Native American Stories_ .”)


 - Ask students to turn to the table of contents, locate the chapter, and then
turn to the first page of the chapter.


 - Have students take a few minutes to talk about the images in the chapter and
then ask them to predict why this chapter might be titled “Etu, the Hunter.”


 - Brainstorm with students the meaning of the word _needs_ and what some of
their needs are.


» Answers may vary but could include food, water, shelter, and clothing.


 - Now, ask students how they have their needs met, for example, how do they
end up with food on their tables at mealtimes?


» Answers may vary but could include families use money to buy food at a grocery

store, they store food in the refrigerator and cabinets, and they cook food at home.


 - Tell students that Etu’s people obtain food in a very different way than we
know. Ask students if any of them have ever gone hunting.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Speaking and Listening**

 - Identify Image Cards C.U7.L1.1 and C.U7.L1.2 from Lesson 1.


 - Copy and enter students’ names on the Teacher Observation Form at the end
of the lesson.


 - Identify the following Digital Images to project during the Read-Aloud:
U7.L2.1–U7.L2.7. Please note, the Digital Images U7.L2.1 and U7.L1.8 are
the same.

**Language**

 - On chart paper create the Possessive Nouns Chart or prepare to display
Digital Projection DP.U7.L2.1.


**Possessive Nouns**


A **singular possessive noun** shows that one person, place, or thing has
or owns something. Form a **singular possessive noun** by adding an
apostrophe and ‘s’ to a singular noun (– _’s_ ).


A **plural possessive noun** shows that more than one person, place, or thing
has or owns something. To form a **plural possessive noun** from a plural noun
that ends with ‘s’ or ‘es’, add only an apostrophe to the plural noun (– _s’_ ).


If a plural noun does not end with ‘s’, add – _’s_ to form a **plural**
**possessive noun** .


 - Write the following sentences on the board, or chart paper, and cover them
up:


1. The childrens friends came over to play.


2. The mens room is to the left of the womens room.


3. The mices homes were toasty and warm.


4. The peoples ideas were all written down.


**Universal Access**

 - Review terms from Lesson 1 that will be relevant for Lesson 2: _regions,_
_migratory, Ice Age, woolly mammoth_ . Students can make vocabulary
flashcards quickly on index cards: word on one side, definition on the other.
If possible, you can use pictures. Students could glue a picture of a woolly
mammoth to one side of the card and write the word on the other.


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures


- You can remind students that some Native Americans were migratory,
meaning they traveled to different places for various reasons. Remind
students that the Native American groups often moved seasonally for shelter
and food.

**Beringia Migration**



~~**BERINGIA MIGRATION MAP (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students they will be locating some of the areas that they heard about
in the previous Read-Aloud and labeling them on a map. They will also be
drawing arrows on the map to show some of the routes used by the people of
Asia to migrate to different areas of North America. Remind students that it
is believed that there were several ways people migrated to North America,
and while not all anthropologists still believe this was the first method of
migration, this unit will focus on the Beringia migration.


 - Give each student a copy of Activity Page 2.1. Write the following words on a
piece of chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard:


1. Asia


2. Beringia


3. Alaska


4. North America


5. Ice-Free Corridor


6. South America


 - Ask for student volunteers to point to each of the locations or routes on
Image Card C.U7.L1.1 (Beringia Migration). When the student correctly
identifies each location, have all students label that area on their own Activity
Page. Follow the same procedure for each of the remaining five areas.


 - Once students have correctly labeled the six areas, they will draw and label
two migration routes on the map on Activity Page 2.1. Write the following
phrases on a piece of chart paper, a chalkboard, or a whiteboard:


1. the route from Asia through Beringia to North America


2. the route through the Ice-Free Corridor to various parts of North America,

south to South America


 - Ask students to choose two different colored pencils or crayons, one for each
route they will be labeling on the map. Tell students to select one colored
pencil or crayon for the first route that shows how the early Americans may
have traveled from Asia through Beringia to North America.


 - Ask students to use that colored pencil or crayon to color in the arrow on the
key next to the phrase, “Route from Asia to North America.” Ask for a student
volunteer to trace with their finger on Image Card C.U7.L1.1 the route the
early Americans may have used to migrate through Beringia from Asia to
North America. When the student correctly identifies this route, ask students


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures



**42**


to use the colored pencil or crayon they just used on the key to draw the
route on their individual maps.


 - Ask students to use their second colored pencil or crayon to color in the
arrow on the key next to the phrase, “Route through Ice-Free Corridor.” Ask
for another student volunteer to show on Image Card C.U7.L1.1 the route the
early Americans used to migrate throughout the continent of North America
and to South America. When the student correctly identifies this route, ask
students to use the colored pencil or crayon they just used on the key to
draw the route on their individual maps.


~~**PERSONAL TRAITS SHARING (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Organize students into small groups of three to four students with Activity
Page 1.5 from yesterday’s Take-Home Assignment. Explain to students that
in each group, one student will share their responses on Activity Page 1.5.


 - Say: When you are presenting your traits to the small group, focus on
speaking clearly and at an understandable pace.


 - Teacher modeling: Speak clearly and at an understandable pace to model
for students.


 - Remind students that when they are not presenting they will be active
listeners and may ask questions or help the presenter add additional
information to Activity Page 1.5.


**Note:** While students are presenting in small groups, complete an informal

observation using the Teacher Observation Form.


Check for Understanding


If students are not speaking clearly or at an understandable rate, then
pull students aside in small groups to model appropriate pace and
speaking clearly.


~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Briefly review with students the theory that most of the early inhabitants of
North America came from Asia across the area known as Beringia. Have a
volunteer point to the areas of Asia, North America, and Beringia on Image
Card C.U7.L1.1 (Beringia Migration). Ask students, “How does this area look
today?” Guide students to remember that this area between Asia and North
America is covered by water (the Bering Strait) and is not connected as

many scientists think it was during the Ice Age. Have a volunteer point to
the Bering Sea on Image Card C.U7.L1.2 (Native American Regions of North
America).


  - Ask students how they think those early Americans acquired their food.
Encourage students to use the word _migratory_ in their answer. Tell students
that today they will hear about a major change that occurred in the way in
which the early Americans lived and obtained their food.


  - Ask students if they know what regions are. Show Image Card C.U7.L1.2, and
remind students that as Native people migrated across North America, they
began to settle in different regions. Ask students how far these early people
migrated. Have a volunteer point to South America on Image Card C.U7.L1.2.


  - Have students turn to Activity Page 2.2. Explain to students that during the
Read-Aloud, we are going to focus on illustrations. Our goal of the lesson is to
determine how the illustration supports the text. During the Read-Aloud, we
will stop to think about:


    - Looking at the illustration, what does it tell us?


    - How does this illustration support the Read-Aloud?


~~**READ-ALOUD: “CHANGING WAYS OF LIFE” (25 MIN.)**~~


During the Read-Aloud, model fluent reading using appropriate rate and

way of life quite significantly, or importantly. They began to plant

and harvest crops such as squash, beans, and maize. Farming added

to the food supply and allowed some groups of people to have the

choice to stay in one place instead of migrating to follow their prey.


Native peoples’ knowledge and understanding of nature, particularly

of plants, was acquired over many years. Over time, they

experimented with growing local grasses and gourds. Eventually

many of them developed the ability to grow a wider variety of plants.

In addition to increasing their food supply by farming, Native peoples

also began to use plants to make such things as clothing, medicine,

homes, and household items. They began to raise animals such as

turkeys, while continuing to hunt, gather, and fish.


- **Picture Pause:** As a whole class, complete Section 1 on Activity Page 2.2.
(Information from the Illustration: the illustration shows Native Americans
hunting, planting and/or harvesting crops, and raising turkeys. Connection
between illustration and Read-Aloud text: The illustration shows Native
Americans hunting, planting and/or harvesting crops, and raising turkeys,
which supports the text that says, “while they continued to hunt, fish, and

Americans harvesting a crop which supports the text that says, “growing
local grasses and gourds”; the illustration shows clothes hanging on a line

called tribes. Each tribe had its



own name, language, set of beliefs, and overall **cultural identity** . How

each tribe lived, the clothes the tribe members wore, the foods they ate,

and the homes they lived in depended greatly upon the **environment** in

which they lived. This is especially true of language. Different words were

created that related specifically to regional beliefs and habitats. And so

the languages of these Native peoples became widely different from

region to region, and from tribe to tribe within a region.


Trade brought Native peoples from different regions together, and

a greater understanding of farming techniques spread. When tribes

from different regions met to trade, they not only shared their ideas

of farming techniques, they also traded crops and seeds. In this

way, tribes began growing crops that were not native to the region

in which they lived. With a more reliable food supply, and the ability

to store corn for two to three years to be used when there was not

a good harvest, the population of Native peoples in North America

began to increase, and large settlements began to develop in

different regions.

Plains Native Americans






- **Picture Pause:** Explain to students that after the following paragraph is read
aloud, we will analyze the illustration.


That is not to say that all tribes settled in one place, however. Some,

such as the Shoshone, Cheyenne, and Blackfoot of the Central Plains

never really settled in the true sense of the word. They often followed

the enormous herds of bison that moved with the seasons. The bison

provided them with everything they needed, including food, clothes, and

materials for the tipis they lived in. It is believed that, at one time, more

than thirty million bison roamed parts of North America. Over time,

these Central Plains tribes grew out of their migratory lifestyle.

Tribal leaders


Other groups, such as the southeastern

Cherokee and northeastern Iroquois,

moved from place to place in the





wintertime when the earth would not



yield any food, and hunting was the only way to survive. Tribes such

as these returned to their settlements in the spring.


Nevertheless, once large Native populations began to live in

settlements, there came the need for new rules. Violence could be

common. Some Native American tribes engaged in violent religious

rituals. Neighboring tribes could go to war. Rules developed over time

to help groups of people live together in relative peace. Eventually,

individual tribal laws, languages, clothing, customs, and religious

beliefs began to set them apart from each other.


**Show Image U7.L2.5**
Clothing


Clothes were made from local

resources, too, and varied enormously

from region to region. Furs and animal





hides were worn in the colder regions



and on the Great Plains. Cloth woven from plant fiber was common in

warmer regions, and local plant dyes were used to **embellish** clothes

and possessions. Many Native Americans also embellished their skin

with markings, piercings, and tattoos.

- **Picture Pause:** Explain to students that after the following paragraph is read
aloud, they will analyze the illustration.


By the time Christopher Columbus and other Europeans arrived in

North America thousands of years later, Native Americans had brought

about the creation of a very different world than that of the Europeans.

It was a world that included many hundreds of unique Native tribes,

with diverse methods of farming, trading, and ceremonial practices.

Native tribes now inhabited lands all across North America, sometimes

allied with nearby tribes, and sometimes at war with them. Because

Christopher Columbus thought that he had arrived in a part of Asia

called the Indies, he called these Native peoples “Indians”; however,

they were many different people with many different names.


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures


Once the Europeans arrived in North America, the Native tribes would

face new people, new technology, new diseases, and new cultures.

They would need to adapt, just as their environments had required

them to adapt for centuries before. For many tribes, much of their

traditional way of life would not be able to survive the changes.


In the next part of this unit, you will learn about some of the tribes

who survived, and still live, in various parts of North America. These

resilient tribes have thriving cultures, and some still practice traditional

ceremonies and speak Native languages. You will discover what made

them unique and knowledgeable, and how they have helped, and

continue to help, shape the history and culture of the United States.


 - **Picture Pause:** Independently, have students complete Section 3 on
Activity Page 2.2.


Check for Understanding


If students could not identify connections between the illustration and
Read-Aloud text, have students use small sticky notes to label key parts of
the illustration and identify where those key parts are in the text.


~~**WORD WORK: ENVIRONMENT (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _environment_ on the board in cursive and provide an
opportunity for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being
discussed. Review any obvious syllable patterns at this time.


2. In the Read-Aloud, you heard, “How each tribe lived, the clothes the tribe
members wore, the foods they ate, and the homes they lived in depended
greatly upon the _environment_ in which they lived.”


3. _Environment_ means a person’s physical surroundings or the
surrounding conditions.


4. The environment in the Arctic region is cold and harsh.


5. How would you describe the environment in our classroom? Be sure to use
the word _environment_ when you tell about it. (Ask two or three students. If
necessary, guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses to make complete
sentences: “The environment in our classroom is .”)

~~**REGIONS MAP (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Have students take out Activity Page 2.3. Tell students that today they will
be labeling on a map some of the regions that they heard about in today’s
Read-Aloud. Write the following geographic regions on a piece of chart paper,
a chalkboard, or a whiteboard:


1. Southwest


2. Northeast


3. Southeast


4. Arctic/Subarctic


 - Review with students the cardinal directions of north, east, south, and west.

Tell students that there is a mnemonic device to remember these cardinal
directions. Ask students if they know that mnemonic device, (“Never Eat
Soggy Waffles”), and if they know how to apply it to the map. Ask for a student
volunteer to identify the cardinal directions on Image Card C.U7.L1.2 (Native
American Regions of North America).


 - Ask for a student volunteer to point to the Southwest region on Image Card

C.U7.L1.2. When the student correctly identifies that area, have all students
label that area on their own copies of Activity Page 2.3. Follow the same
procedure for each of the remaining three geographic regions.


 - After students have labeled all four regions, ask if they see a connection

between the cardinal directions on the map and the name given to the
Southwest, Northeast, and Southeast regions. Review the prefix _sub_ –, and
remind students that the subarctic is “below,” or just south of, the Arctic.

                 - Remind students that plural possessive nouns are formed by adding an

apostrophe to a plural noun that ends with ‘s’ or ‘es.’


                   - Ask students if all plural nouns end with ‘s’ or ‘es.’


» No, some nouns, when made plural, are different words from their singular

counterparts and are called irregular plurals. Examples are: _man_ and _men, woman_

and _women_, _mouse_ and _mice_, _person_ and _people_, and _child_ and _children_ .


                  - Tell students that when a plural noun does not end with ‘s’ or ‘es,’ you add an

apostrophe and ‘s’ (– _’s_ ) to make it a possessive noun.


                 - Read the first sentence aloud that you placed on the board in advance

without uncovering it.

**“The Sparrow”**

**Paul Laurence Dunbar**


A little bird, with plumage brown,
Beside my window flutters down,
A moment chirps its little strain,
Ten taps upon my window–pane,
And chirps again, and hops along,
To call my notice to its song;
But I work on, nor heed its lay,
Till, in neglect, it flies away.



So birds of peace and hope and love
Come fluttering earthward from above,
To settle on life’s window–sills,
And ease our load of earthly ills;
But we, in traffic’s rush and din
Too deep engaged to let them in,
With deadened heart and sense plod on,
Nor know our loss till they are gone.

So near you are, summer stars,
So near, strumming, strumming,

So lazy and hum-strumming.

**Possessive Nouns**


A **singular possessive noun** shows that one person, place, or thing has
or owns something. Form a **singular possessive noun** by adding an
apostrophe and ‘s’ to a singular noun. (– _’s_ )


A **plural possessive noun** shows that more than one person, place, or
thing has or owns something. To form a **plural possessive noun** from a
plural noun that ends with ‘s’ or ‘es’, add only an apostrophe to the plural
noun. (– _s’_ )


If a plural noun does not end with ‘s’, add – _’s_ to form a **plural**
**possessive noun** .

                  - During the lesson, students will be discussing setting, _point of view_,
characters, and _mood_ . Ask students if they remember the point of view of
the story “Etu, the Hunter” from an earlier lesson. Discuss the meaning of
_point of view_ . Ask questions like, “Who was the main character of the story?
Who was telling us the story?” If possible, hold up a picture of “Etu” from the
Reader.


                  - Remind students of this idea from Lesson 1: “Tell students that most of the
chapters in _Native American Stories_ are told from a child’s point of view. Note
for students that this means a child is telling the story in each chapter.” You
can ask students if they like reading stories from a child’s point of view.


                  - Ask students, “How would the story ‘Etu, the Hunter’ be different if it was told
from the point of view of Etu’s father? What if the story was told from the
woolly mammoth’s point of view?” Finally, you can emphasize the idea that
the _point of view_ is a choice the author makes about how to tell the story.


                 - During the upcoming lesson, with the whole class, you will be discussing

definitions of _mood, setting, characters_, and _point of view_ . Tell students
that they will use text and illustrations to learn more about these literary
elements when reading the story “Akando and Aponi, the Gatherers.”

~~**INTRODUCING THE READING (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that the title of this lesson’s chapter is “Akando and Aponi,
the Gatherers.”


 - Remind students that each chapter is about a group of people from a
different area of North America.


 - Assign students to five small groups to review the illustrations from the
chapter. Each group will be assigned one illustration from the Reader. On
a blank piece of paper, have the group make predictions about the reading
based on the illustration and write their predictions on their paper.


**Note:** Students will explain how the illustration supports the reading at the

end of the lesson.


 - Tell students that they will read the chapter as a whole group and their

focus will be on analyzing the illustrations in the text. Explain that authors
use illustrations to help create the mood of the story and give the reader
more information about the setting and characters. Explain that _mood_ is the
feeling you get as a reader. Does the illustration make you happy, sad, scared,
or excited? Stop throughout the reading to analyze the following:


   - **Setting:** What does the author want to show us in the illustration about
the setting? What additional information can the reader learn about the
setting from looking at the illustration?


   - **Characters:** What does the artist want to show us in the illustration about
the characters? What additional information can the reader learn about
the characters by looking at the illustration?


   - **Mood:** How does the illustration help create the mood? Is the illustration
dark or bright?



Support


Review with students that
characters are the people,
animals, or creatures
in the story and the
setting is where the story
takes place.


Challenge


Introduce different artists’
techniques that are used to
create various effects, such
as the use of shape, space,
color, and size.

to answer.


» At this time of year, the children gathered nuts, fruits, berries, onions, and

milkweed to be preserved for the winter.


  - Direct students’ attention to the image on **page 17** and read the caption

Lesson 3 “Akando and Aponi, the Gatherers”
**65**


The crops that we grew, sunflowers, corn, squash,
and tobacco, were also being harvested. Some of the
older children were busily helping in the fields. Only the
spiritual leaders were allowed to gather tobacco and the
roots and bark that were used for medicine.


I looked ahead, in search of Akando. My brother was
so far ahead of me that I was losing sight of him.


“Akando, slow down,” I called to my brother. “Can
we rest for a while?”


Akando looked back at me. He is my older brother,
though not by much, and he is stronger than I am.
Akando had a large **birch** bark basket strapped around
his waist. It was almost full to the brim with hickory
nuts and hazelnuts. I had a basket strapped to my waist
too. Mine was smaller than his and it was only half full
with butternuts and acorns.


“Just for a short while, Aponi,” he yelled back. “We
haven’t even begun to collect the berries.”


_Aponi calls to Akando to wait._

Akando walked back and sat down beside me on the
ground. “Want to play a game?” he asked.


“Yes. What game?” I replied eagerly.


“We’ll play a guessing game,” Akando replied. “Now,
turn away until I say you can look.”


Akando was very bossy but I loved him. He always
stuck up for me when some of the children in the village
teased me.


“Okay, ready!” said Akando.


I turned around to see that three large, **autumnal**
oak leaves had been placed on the ground. Akando had
placed a stone under one of them and I had to guess
which one. I only had one guess. We would do this three
times, then we would switch and Akando would have to
guess.


“The one in the middle,” I said hopefully.


“Wrong!” exclaimed Akando. “It’s the one on the
left,” he said as he lifted up the leaf to reveal the stone.



My next guess was also wrong, but my third and final
guess was correct.

“Now, it’s your turn,” I said.


As always, Akando beat me. He got two out of three
guesses right.


“Okay, let’s go,” he said, urging me on. “The sooner
we gather all that we can, the sooner we can return
home.”


“I guess,” I said but I continued to sit on the ground.


“Later on, if you like, I will show you how to beat
me in the guessing game,” Akando offered, trying to spur
me on.


It worked.


“Really?” I asked, jumping to my feet and picking up
my basket.


“Really!” Akando replied. “But first you have to fill
that basket!”


“Okay,” I said, smiling at him.



Then, I grabbed my brother’s hand and walked with
him beneath the canopy of red-, gold-, and coppercolored leaves.

that express feelings and thoughts by using specific styles and rhythms.


- Tell students that poems are written in lines and stanzas instead of complete

sentences and paragraphs like other texts in this unit.


- Say: “A line is one row of text in a poem.” Point to the copy of “The Sparrow”
that you have projected and ask students how many lines they count in this
poem. _(Answer: 16)_

  - If possible, annotate the poem and number the lines as students count
them.


- Tell students that groups of lines are called stanzas. Ask: “Do you notice how

the first group of lines are grouped together?” Tell students that a group of
lines is called a stanza. Tell students that stanzas are similar to paragraphs.

“Stanza 2” next to lines 9–16.


- Read the poem aloud to students. When finished, ask the following
questions:

1. What did you notice about the last words of each line? _(They rhyme.)_

2. What did you notice about the way I read the poem? _(There was a rhythm_
_to the reading.)_


- Tell students that the rhyming words in poems help to create that rhythm.
Tell students that the pattern of rhymes that comes at the end of lines in a
poem is called the rhyme scheme.


- Tell students that poets, or people who write poetry, use figurative and
expressive language. They may read poems with similes, metaphors, or
onomatopoeia. Remind students that onomatopoeia are words that are
associated with a sound.

  - Ask: “Can you think of any words that make sounds?”

  - Have students turn and talk to a partner and share their sound words, or
onomatopoeias.

  - Call on a few students to share with the class.


- Tell students to look at the poem “The Sparrow” on Activity Page 3.2.


- Have students work with a partner to identify the number of lines and
stanzas in this poem. As students work, circulate and provide feedback as
needed.

  - _Answer: 7 lines, 1 stanza_

  - When students have finished counting lines and stanzas, ask them to

turn and talk with their partner about how this poem is different from
“The Sparrow.” Call on a few students to share their responses. _(Answers_

**Lesson 3: “Akando and Aponi, the Gatherers”**
###### Language



45M



**Primary Focus:** Students will decode and spell words using knowledge of suffixes,

including how they can change base words to determine the meaning of words

formed when – _ish_ or – _ness_ is added to the known root word.

~~**TEKS 3.2.A.vi; TEKS 3.2.B.vii; TEKS 3.3.C; TEKS 3.2.D**~~


Students will form singular and plural possessive nouns. ~~**TEKS 3.11.D.x**~~


~~**MORPHOLOGY: SUFFIXES –ISH AND –NESS (20 MIN.)**~~


**Introduce Suffixes –ish and –ness**

  - Remind students that suffixes are added to the end of a root word.


  - Tell students that the two suffixes they will study in this lesson are _–ish_
and _–ness_ .


  - Write the suffixes on the board and point out that the suffix _–ish_ is
pronounced /ish/ and the suffix _–ness_ is pronounced /nes/.


  - Explain to students that _–ish_ means “having the characteristics of” or “like.”


  - Tell students that they will add the suffix _–ish_ to root words that are nouns.
The new words created are adjectives.


  - Write _fool_ on the board in cursive. Briefly discuss the meaning of the word and
then use it in a sentence. (someone who is ridiculous and acts without good
sense or judgment; “He acted like a fool to try and impress a girl he liked.”)


  - Add the suffix _–ish_ to _fool_ and have students read the suffix, read the
new word, and then discuss the meaning of the new word. (having the
characteristics of, or like, someone who is ridiculous and acts without good
sense or judgment)


  - Share the following example of the use of _foolish_ in a sentence: “He made a
foolish choice when he bought that expensive car without having a job.”


  - Continue in this manner for the remaining _–ish_ words, using the following
chart as a guide.


  - You may wish to project DP.U7.L3.2 (Suffix Chart – _ish_ ).

**Note:** You will not write the information in the shaded columns on the board

as that information is intended for use during oral instruction.

)



**Projection DP.U7.L2.1**



**Possessive Nouns**


A **singular possessive noun** shows that one person, place, or thing has
or owns something. Form a **singular possessive noun** by adding an
apostrophe and ‘s’ to a singular noun. (– _’s_ )


A **plural possessive noun** shows that more than one person, place, or thing
has or owns something. To form a **plural possessive noun** from a plural
noun that ends with ‘s’ or ‘es’, add only an apostrophe to the plural noun. (– _s’_ )


If a plural noun does not end with ‘s’, add – _’s_ to form a **plural**
**possessive noun** .


  - Read the following phrases to students and have them change the noun
that shows ownership to a singular possessive noun. An example would be:
_The green lunchbox that belongs to Ron_ becomes _Ron’s green lunchbox_ .
Note for students that the adjective _green_ describes the _lunchbox_ and
remains in its place before the noun it describes when the phrase is made to
show possession.


    - The blue book that belongs to my mother (my _mother’s_ blue book)


    - The shiny sports car of my Uncle Sam ( _Uncle Sam’s_ shiny sports car)


    - The pink and blue polka-dotted dress of Pam ( _Pam’s_ pink and blue polkadotted dress)


  - Have students justify their answers by restating how singular possessive
nouns are formed.


» Singular possessive nouns are formed by adding an apostrophe and ‘s’ to a

singular noun.


  - Divide students into 10 teams and give each team one of the phrase strips
you prepared and cut apart in advance. Teams will receive either a strip of a
noun phrase that shows ownership or a strip of a phrase that shows the noun
having been changed to a singular possessive noun.


  - Tell students that they need to match their strip with its partner. Give

students time to find their match.


  - After all teams have found their partners, have each team read the two
strips aloud.


  - “Where does the apostrophe go in a singular possessive noun?”


» before the ‘s’

~~**SPELLING: DICTATION (10 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that they will practice writing their spelling words for this
lesson. Remind students to write legibly in cursive leaving appropriate
spaces between words.


 - Tell students to turn to Activity Page 3.4.


 - Tell students that you will say one spelling word at a time, and they will write
that word on the blank lines on Activity Page 3.4.


 - Read the following sentences containing spelling words. Read the word
aloud. Then read the sentence.


   - distance: Etu traveled a great distance following the woolly mammoths.


   - dozen: Rita collects items in groups of 12, so she has a dozen.


   - glistening: The beautiful, glistening snow fell last night while everyone slept.


   - company: Mother said we needed to clean our rooms very well because we

were expecting company.


   - independent: My baby brother wants to be able to do things himself and
be independent.


   - deposit: Will you take my check to the bank and deposit it, please?


   - American: Our Reader is called _Native American Stories_ .


   - probably: Mother says I can probably go to the movies with my friends.


 - Now, tell students that you will say words aloud one at a time, and they will
sort those words into two columns: No Suffix and Suffix. For words that do
not have a suffix, write them on the blank lines under “No Suffix.” If a word
has a suffix, write it under the column “Suffix.” Write enemy in cursive in the
column titled “No Suffix.” Point out that the word does not contain a suffix.


 - Read the following words aloud: _aware, dark, feverish, child, quickness, ft,_
_sick, foolish, fever._


 - Circulate and provide informative, corrective feedback during dictation.




                 - Student dictation can serve as valuable formative assessment feedback.

                 - Write sentences found on p. 94 on chart paper for student to read.

**Universal Access**

                 - Before whole group review of answers to Question Cards: In small groups,
during the lesson, students will use Question Cards to review what they have
learned in previous lessons. Some questions, including “Who can recall what
_cultural identity_ means?” may be rather challenging for students.


                - For students who may need some extra assistance, include the answers on

one side of the Question Card so that students can look up the answer if they
are confused. A student can read the answer aloud to the small group after
the group has discussed their responses to each Question Card. This will
allow students to reflect upon and self-assess their own knowledge in a small
group without waiting for the teacher to correct or confirm.


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures
**84**


  - After students read the answers on the back of the Question Card, ask them

to write an example. For example, on the Question Card “Who can recall what
_cultural identity_ means?” students should recall their “Quick Write” from
Lesson 2, Activity Book 2.4 and write an example of Native American cultural
identity or personal cultural identity. Creating examples will help students
apply their knowledge and create more personal connections to the content.


  - Finally, tell students that today they will be learning about Mound Builders

and Native Americans in the Greater Mississippi River region. They will think
about and discuss the Mound Builders’ cultural identity and traditions and
discuss how this tribe is the same or different from the other groups they
have learned about so far.

Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures
**86**


- As a whole group, review the answers to the Native American Question Cards:


  - How did farming change the lives of the early people?

» Once people began to farm, it allowed them to stay in one place if they

chose to. Farming increased the food supply, and, as a result, the population

increased. With settlement came the need for additional rules to help large

numbers of people live together.


  - Why do you think the population increased once people began to farm?

» People were less susceptible to hunger and starvation. With more food, it was

possible to feed a greater number of people. Also, corn could be stored for two

to three years, and the surplus provided back-up food in less productive years.


  - How did people begin to use plants?

» to make things such as clothes, homes, and medicines


  - What else did people raise for food?

» animals, such as turkeys


  - What are some of the regions where people began to settle and build

different types of homes?


» Northwest, Canada, Northeast, Southwest, Central Plains, Southeast


  - Who can recall what _cultural identity_ means?

» Cultural identity is a sense of culture that a particular group has of itself.


- Tell students that, a long time ago, some Native people began to settle in towns
in a region near the Mississippi River. Point out using Image Card C.U7.L1.2 that
it forms the border between the Central Plains and regions to the east.


  - Ask, “Why do you think people would want to settle near a river?”

» to have water to drink, to cook with, to wash clothes in, for transportation using

canoes, to irrigate their crops, and to be able to plant their crops in rich river soils


**Note:** Students who have participated in the program have learned about

many civilizations that have developed around large rivers, such as the

ancient Chinese around the Yangtze River, the ancient Egyptians around the

Nile, and the ancient Mesopotamians around the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers.


- Tell students that these Native people began to build many mounds in this

region. Ask, “Does anyone know what a _mound_ is?” Show students digital image

Early farming, hunting, and fishing in
the Mississippi River Valley


More than three thousand years ago, in

the river valleys north, south, east, and





west of the Mississippi River, several

groups of early Americans began to



spread out and inhabit this large region rich in fertile soil. Because of

the richness of the soil in the Mississippi River Valley, there was an

abundance of plants that could be harvested for food. There was also

a wide variety of fruits and berries that could be gathered. In addition,

there were long, winding freshwater rivers that were **teeming** with fish.


In the beginning, the groups of people who lived in this region

survived by hunting, fishing, and gathering. Then, while continuing

to hunt, many of them also began to farm. As you heard earlier,

farming provided groups of people with a more reliable food supply.

In particular, they began to grow sunflowers and squash. Later, they

grew corn and beans. Because these early peoples began to farm the

land, it became necessary for them to stay close to their crops. As a

result, they began to construct permanent homes and settlements.

Early Mississippian settlement
surrounding mounds


Just as the ancient Egyptians, Maya,

Aztec, and Inca built giant structures





that rose up toward the heavens, so

too did these early Native peoples of



eastern North America. They built amazing mounds.


Some of the mounds were small with rounded tops. Others were

flat-topped mounds. Others rose up into the sky like pyramids. Some

were burial mounds, whereas others were strictly for **ceremonial**

purposes. There were mounds shaped like animals too. Often the

chief of the settlement, as the most important leader, had his home

built on top of a mound. Today archaeologists call this early Native

culture the Mississippian Culture.


The Mississippians were one of the three distinct groups known

as Mound Builders. These three groups, the Adena, Hopewell, and

Mississippians, lived at different times in and around this region of

North America.

These mounds functioned as earthen burial chambers and religious

ceremonial sites.


The Adena inhabited a large area near the Ohio River in what are

now the states of Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia, Kentucky, and parts

of Pennsylvania and New York. So this group of Mound Builders had

moved into some areas that were connected to the Mississippi River

by the Ohio River, and some other areas that were quite a distance

away from both rivers.


When you consider how difficult it must have been to build the mounds,

it seems likely that developing a system and plan were strong aspects

of the cultural identity of the Adena. Building a mound required a lot of

people working together. They had to move tons of earth from one place

to another, with nothing more than baskets to hold it.

**Show Image U7.L4.3**
Adena civilization


The Adena were one of the early

groups of people to build mounds.

They built mounds that ranged in size





from less than twenty feet to more

than three hundred feet in diameter.

**Show Image U7.L4.4**
Adena funerary procession


Why did these Native Americans build

the mounds? Well, just as with many

ancient cultures, the reason was

connected to the Adena’s religious

beliefs. Proper burial and honoring



their ancestors was very important to them.


**Show Image U7.L4.5**
Grave Creek Mound today


The largest and most impressive

Adena burial mound still **evident** in

North America is in West Virginia and





is known as Grave Creek Mound. This

is a modern name for an ancient site.



More than sixty thousand tons of soil were moved in the construction

of this mound, and it is thought to have taken more than one hundred

years to complete.


**Show Image U7.L4.6**
Serpent Mound today


But perhaps the most interesting

Adena construction is the curved

Serpent Mound in Ohio, which was not





a burial mound but an **effigy** mound.

In this case, this effigy is a mound



shaped into a 1,370-foot snake. The Adena believed in the power of

animal spirits, and this one is thought to have been a very important

religious site. It is the largest effigy earthwork in the world.


Lesson 4 Native Americans of the Greater Mississippi River Areas
**91**


**Show Image U7.L4.7**
Hopewell mound and settlement


Gradually, however, the Adena

culture merged with other cultures

to become the next group of Native

Mound Builders called the Hopewell.

The Hopewell built well-constructed



villages along riverbanks. They produced food by hunting; by

gathering nuts, seeds, fruits, and roots; by farming; and by fishing.

They used animal hides for clothing, mats, and homes. They made

stone pipes, used copper and, like the Adena, traded with other

Native peoples. Today scientists believe that Hopewell sites show

evidence of trade connections from the Rocky Mountains to Lake

Superior to North Carolina—practically across the entire continent.

These sites also reveal what extraordinary artists the Hopewell were.

Archaeologists know this from artifacts that have survived, including

decorative pottery in the shapes of animals and human beings.


Hopewell mounds were even bigger than the Adena mounds. It’s

possible that these mounds were used not only for burial purposes

but also as ceremonial temples, and perhaps even for defense

purposes, in addition to providing high ground in times of flooding.

Within Hopewell settlements, tribal and religious leaders would have

had a significant amount of power. The Hopewell had rules—just

as all societies do—designed to help large groups of people live in

one place. Chiefs and religious leaders were often responsible for

enforcing these rules.

perhaps the most developed mound



culture of all. They were a people who relied upon corn as their most

important food crop. They lived in large towns, sometimes referred to

as **city-states.** They were populated by hundreds, if not thousands,

of people. The largest Mississippian town was Cahokia (kuh- _ho_ -kee
uh) in what is now Illinois.


Within each Mississippian town, there were several mounds, but

the most important mound was a flat-topped mound upon which

sat a religious temple or a ruler’s home. The flat-topped mound

was usually constructed in a central plaza. Mississippian mounds

were several stories high and were symbols of the people’s religious

beliefs. They were expert craftspeople, artists, and builders. The

people were governed by powerful leaders and priests, and their

religious beliefs touched every aspect of their lives. When Europeans

came to North America, they encountered the Mississippian people.


Lesson 4 Native Americans of the Greater Mississippi River Areas

The largest mound in this town is one of the mounds still in existence

today and is known as Monk’s Mound. It covers an area of sixteen

acres. It is larger at its base than the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt!

Over a very long period of time,

thousands of mounds were

constructed by these three distinct





groups of people: the Adena,



Hopewell, and Mississippians. This Mississippian mound is in

Georgia. None of the names mentioned here are Native names. We do

not know what these people called their mounds, or even what they

called themselves. Ironically, it is the mounds that provide us with a

“window to the past.” After thousands of years, the mounds—and the

artifacts that have been discovered in and around them—speak to us

of a time long ago before Europeans came to this continent.


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (20 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** How many groups of Mound Builders did you learn about, and what were
their names?


» There were three groups of Mound Builders: the Adena, the Hopewell, and

the Mississippians.


Did these three groups live and build mounds at the same time or at different times?


» different times


2. **Inferential.** Where did the Mound Builders live?


» near the Mississippi River and surrounding areas (Have a volunteer point to the

Mississippi River and the states of Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri,

Pennsylvania, Illinois, and New York on a U.S. map.)

Why did they choose to settle near a river?


» to have access to water for drinking, irrigating crops, growing crops in rich river

soil, and traveling


If you visited this area today, what could you see very clearly that shows that the
Mound Builders lived in this region?


» many mounds


3. **Inferential.** Why did the Mound Builders build mounds?


» for burial sites for their ancestors, for ceremonial and religious reasons, and

possibly as defense structures


4. **Evaluative.** It took more than one hundred years to construct Grave Creek
Mound. If a generation of ancient people lived for approximately thirty to forty years,
how many generations of people may have worked on its construction?


» At least three, possibly four, generations of people could have worked on

this mound.

American Southwest


The American Southwest is a land rich in

history and tradition. It has been home

to many different Native people for





centuries. Many of these early cultures



were nomadic tribes. These tribes moved often. They followed large

herds of animals so they could hunt.


In addition to being hunters, they were also gatherers. They added plants

they found to their diets. Some plants were wild berries, fruits, and nuts.

These tribes were experts on the world around them. They knew when

certain plants would be ripe to gather. Over time, some tribes learned

how to grow their own food. As a result, some Native cultures settled in

villages and grew crops. Others preferred to live a nomadic life, moving

seasonally in search for new food to gather or hunt.


  - Before asking the following questions, review cause and effect with students.


    - Cause: something that happens


    - Effect: what happens because of that thing or event


  - Quick write: Ask students to identify a cause-and-effect relationship from the

and the Ancestral Pueblo settled near rivers where water was more

plentiful. They would use this to water the crops in the fields. Slowly, the

earliest Natives of the American Southwest began to grow and prosper.


The largest groups of the Hohokam and the Ancestral Pueblo lived along

travel routes. These places were good for long-distance **trade** . Being

close to rivers meant that **goods** could be moved back and forth by water

over long distances. Though early Native Americans did not make roads,

they did use well-worn trails. Often, these trails lay near the area where

buffalo herds gathered. Because they settled their villages near rivers and

trails, they were able to set up trading centers.


Their location allowed them to trade with other communities. Using rivers

as roads, they gathered items that they could not find or produce. Some

items were food, clothing, or tools. They traveled far away, sometimes

hundreds of miles, to trade. This helped them meet their needs. It

also allowed them to form strong bonds with neighboring tribes. The

Southwest became a thriving center of commerce and culture.

Mustangs


About 500 years ago, the arrival of

Spanish explorers brought drastic

changes to the lives of the Native





peoples. Among the greatest of those



changes were horses. The Spanish brought horses from Europe. The

horses thrived on the plains of Texas. These wild horses became

known as **mustangs** .


The tribes of the Southwest, like those living on grassy plains, quickly

embraced horses. Horses allowed nomadic tribes to move faster. If

they could travel farther distances, this meant they could increase

trade and explore more land. For some tribes, like the Comanche,

horses would become an important part of their culture.

Lesson 5 Native Americans of the Southwest Including Texas
**113**


**Show Image U7.L5.4**
Cabeza de Vaca arrives in Texas


One of the first Spanish explorers to

make contact with the Native peoples

in Texas was Cabeza de Vaca. He

had been exploring along the Gulf



of Mexico when his ship was sunk in a storm. He was stranded on

Galveston Island. The journey back to Spanish lands in Mexico took

him several years. During that time, he met many Native tribes, such

as the Jumano (hoo-mah-no). At that time, the Jumano were a great

tribe in Texas. Their land spanned from the Colorado River to the Rio

Grande. It was a large area that has led some historians to question

whether the Jumano were one tribe or several. Regardless, it is clear

that the Jumano had a strong impact on Southwest Texas.


**Show Image U7.L5.5**
The Jumano Tribe


The Jumano were known far and

wide for their skill as traders. They

bartered goods with other tribes and





with the Spanish. They often traveled



many miles to trade. Soon, people all over the Southwest came to

the Jumano, because they knew the Jumano could transport goods

for them. In exchange, they gained things that would help their tribe

survive. They traded for things they liked, like metal tools from the

Spanish. They traded for things they just wanted, like glass beads,

ocean shells, and stones to add to their clothing. To help protect them

on their trips, Jumano men had a **distinctive** look. They often painted

horizontal lines on their faces. With this, they were sure to always be

recognized.


Life in a Jumano village was centered around the rivers of South and

West Texas. All aspects of Jumano life were affected by where they


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures
**114**


lived. Their homes were called **pit houses** . Pit houses were built into

the ground to keep cool in the hot climate. The walls were made from

**adobe** . Adobe is a type of mud brick that is strong and protects well

against heat. The Jumano ate a diet of crops that grew well in the

arid climate. Some crops were corn, beans, and squash. Made from

animal hide, their clothes were often sleeveless and lightweight. They

traded for shells, beads, and jewels which they would **intricately**

weave into their clothes.


Slowly, the Jumano peoples began to move further to the west and

south. This puzzled historians. That part of Texas is hotter, drier,

and harder to farm on. The population of Jumano people began to

decrease. Some experts say it was due to diseases. Others say they

became part of other people groups, like the Wichita people. By 1800,

they had all but vanished. The last of the Jumano are believed to have

joined other Pueblo tribes in what is now New Mexico.


**Show Image U7.L5.6**
The Lipan Apache


Today, historians believe the Jumano

were pushed south and west because

of attacks from the expanding Lipan





Apache tribe. For many years, the



Lipan Apache lived in Central Texas. The Lipan Apache did well

amongst the green hills and gurgling streams of the Hill Country. This

region gave the Lipan Apache many things they needed for their way

of life.


Unlike the Jumano who lived in more permanent settlements, the Lipan

Apache were nomadic. Like other tribes of the Plains, their way of life

was built around the buffalo herds. The **buffalo** gave them food, clothing,

and shelter. The tribe showed a deep respect for these animals. They

relied upon them to survive. There were some traditions for buffalo

hunts. They also used every part of the buffalo, wasting nothing.

Lesson 5 Native Americans of the Southwest Including Texas
**115**


As the herds moved, they moved. They lived in tents they could move,

called **tipis** . Tipis were perfect for their nomadic way of life because

they were crafted from buffalo hides and wooden poles that could be

taken apart and packed up quickly when the tribe moved. The crafting

and setting up of a tipi was a big event. All people of the tribe took part.


**Show Image U7.L5.7**
Lipan Apache tribe members


The Lipan Apache wore lightweight

clothing made of hides. They adorned

their clothing with colorful beads and





feathers. This made large designs



that were both beautiful and symbolic. The moccasins they wore

for shoes were soft but sturdy. This was perfect for the rugged land

around them. Like many other tribes, the Lipan Apache also traded

with other tribes. They gave animal hides, meat, and other goods. In

exchange, they gained things they could not make themselves, such

as pottery, cloth, or certain types of food.


The Lipan Apache lived in groups known as bands. A band was an

extended family along with related families who lived and traveled

together. At the head of each band was a leader known as a nantan.

The nantan was chosen for their skill and wisdom. In this way,

each band of the Lipan Apache had their own culture with distinct

traditions. They had unique dances, stories, and rituals. Storytelling

was a great tradition that kept the tribe’s history, values, and beliefs

in place. Their oral history included tales of nature, bravery, and good

behavior. These stories were told and retold around their campfires

until each member of the tribe knew them almost by heart.


Eventually, the Lipan Apaches’ way of life began to change. Over time,

they, too, were pushed out by attacks and expansion of another tribe—

this time it was the Comanche. The last of the Lipan Apache joined

other tribes scattered across the Southwest in the early 1900s. Many

were drawn to other Native tribes of Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico.

The cultures of the Jumano and Lipan

Apache are still alive today. Places where

the Jumano once settled like Big Bend

National Park, help us remember and



learn about these tribes. For the Jumano, ongoing research continues to

show more about their history. The descendants of the Lipan Apache still

live and work around the American Southwest. The town of Lipan, Texas,

serves as a reminder of their legacy.


Lesson 5 Native Americans of the Southwest Including Texas
**117**


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (15 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** You heard about the Jumano today. Where did these Native
Americans live?


» Their land spanned from the Colorado River to the Rio Grande. Jumano villages

were settled around the rivers of South and West Texas.


2. **Inferential.** As with other tribes, there were different items that helped
improve their way of life. What were some of the most useful resources? How
were they helpful?


» Answers may vary, but may include horses, buffaloes, and rivers. Horses helped

by increasing the amount of land the Native Americans could cover, which

increased their ability to trade. Horses also made the time for those trips shorter.

Buffaloes had a lot of useful parts that the Lipan Apache used like the hides for

clothes and tipis. The rivers helped with travel/trade and provided a fresh source

of water.


3. **Evaluative.** In the passage we read, “Unlike the Jumano, the Lipan Apache
were nomadic.” How did this help the Lipan Apache? What did they do
differently than the Jumano?


» The Lipan Apache would follow herds of buffalo. These buffalo supplied important

items that the Lipan Apache would use such as food, clothing, and shelter.


» The Lipan Apache lived a nomadic lifestyle while the Jumano settled close to the

rivers for trade and freshwater.


4. **Evaluative.** How did Native Americans spread through the continent,
changing their ways of life as they did so?


» Many Native tribes of the Southwest lived a nomadic life, like the Lipan Apache.

Other tribes learned how to grow food and settled in one place, like the Jumano

people. When Europeans introduced horses to America, it impacted many

tribes in the Southwest by allowing tribes to cover larger distances, form more

relationships, and increase trade.


~~**WORD WORK: INTRICATELY (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word _intricately_ on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity

for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed. Review

any obvious syllable patterns at this time.


2. In the Read-Aloud you heard, “They traded for shells, beads, and jewels which

they would _intricately_ weave into their clothes.”


3. Say the word _intricately_ with me.


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures
**118**


4. _Intricately_ means designed in such a way that something has many
interrelated, or interconnected, parts and pieces. Each piece of the jigsaw
puzzle was intricately connected with the other pieces.


5. Have you ever seen something that you would describe as being intricately
designed? What was it? Be sure to use the word _intricately_ when you tell
about the thing you are describing. (Ask two or three students. If necessary,
guide and/or rephrase the students’ responses to make complete sentences:
“The clock was quite intricately designed because .”)


6. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _intricately_ ?


7. Follow up with a Synonyms and Antonyms activity. Ask students: “What does
_intricately_ mean? What are some synonyms, or words that have a similar
meaning to it?” Prompt students to provide answers such as _in a complicated_
_way, elaborately, complexly, in a tricky manner, in an involved fashion_, etc.
Then ask, “What are some words or phrases you know that are antonyms,
or opposites, of _intricately_ ?” Prompt students to provide words and phrases
such as _simply, understandably, obviously, in a straightforward way_, etc. Guide
students to use the word _intricately_ in a complete sentence: “An antonym of
_intricately_ is _simply_ .”

baskets of various shapes and sizes. They also created a
whole host of other things. Men could be found sitting
together shaping tools for hunting and farming.


All of the women in our village made baskets. Baskets
were very important because they were used for carrying
water, for storing grain, fruits, nuts, and berries, and
even for cooking.


“Sit near me,” my grandmother said as I came and
stood beside her.


I sighed deeply and threw myself down on the
ground next to her.


She smiled and handed me the basket I had begun to
make the day before.


“Our people have been making these baskets since
time began,” she said. “This skill has been handed down
from one **generation** to the next. It is important that
you learn it, Alemeda.” _Alemeda walks through her village._

~~**SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


**Unit 7, Lesson 5**

                  - Students are likely to make the following errors:


                        - For ‘a’, students may write ‘e,’ ‘I,’ or ‘u.’


                        - For ‘e’, students may write ‘a,’ ‘I,’ or ‘u.’


                 - While the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should be aware

that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find it helpful to
record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the analysis chart.
For example:


                        - Is the student consistently making errors on specific letters? Which ones?


                        - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


                        - Is the student consistently making errors on particular beginning
consonants?


                  - Did the student write the words for each feature correctly?


                 - Examine the dictated sentences for errors in capitalization and punctuation.


                 - Student dictation can serve as valuable formative assessment data.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Language**

                  - On chart paper, create the Spelling Table or project Digital Projection
DP.U7.L6.1.

|‘al’ > /ə/ + /l/|‘le’ > /ə/ + /l/|‘el’ > /ə/ + /l/|‘tion’ > /sh/ +<br>/ə/ + /n/|

|||||
|||||



Note to Teacher


For Lessons 6–10, you will review the /ə/ + /l/ sound spelled ‘al,’ ‘le,’ and ‘el,’
and /sh/ + /ə/ + /n/ spelled ‘tion.’ Students should be familiar with these
spelling alternatives, as they were taught in Grade 2.


                  - The following chart is provided for your review:


                 - Here are some patterns for you to be aware of:


                        - The ‘al’ spelling appears frequently in adjectives ( _fnal, normal, formal_ ).


                        - The ‘le’ and ‘el’ spellings are more common in nouns ( _apple, uncle, eagle,_
_wrinkle, angel, chapel_ ), though they can also be found in other parts of
speech ( _rattle, purple, little, grovel_ ).


                 - The decodable passage for this lesson, “Traditions: Old and New,” can be
found in the Teacher Resources section. Integrate required reading of the
passage to practice decoding words during small-group instruction, partner
work, or independent reading.


                 - Prior to presenting the decodable passage found on page 276, write the
decodable words from the passage in cursive on chart paper or whiteboard
and have students decode the words in isolation for final stable syllable _–le,_
_–ck, –al, –el, –tion, –ed_ (three sounds of past tense ending).

  - Prepare partners for the Partner Read.

**Language**

  - Display Possessive Nouns Chart or prepare Digital Projection DP.U7.L2.1
from Lesson 2.


**Possessive Nouns**


A **singular possessive noun** shows that one person, place, or thing has

or owns something. Form a **singular possessive noun** by adding an
apostrophe and ‘s’ to a singular noun. ( _–’s_ )


A **plural possessive noun** shows that more than one person, place, or thing
has or owns something. To form a **plural possessive noun** from a plural
noun that ends with ‘s’ or ‘es,’ add only an apostrophe to the plural noun. ( _–s’_ )


If a plural noun does not end with ‘s,’ add – _’s_ to form a **plural**

**possessive noun** .


  - Prepare the Dictionary Skills page (1 copy per group).

an engaging way. Then the teacher will read another paragraph in a boring
way and ask students to critique that second performance using the Anchor
Chart. Ask students to remind you of what they learned in previous lessons
about engaging Read-Alouds of stories.


 - Tell students that the oral storytelling tradition is an important part of Native
American cultures. Ask students if they enjoy reading silently or if they like
reading aloud and performing the stories. Discuss how stories can “come to
life” when they are read aloud in an engaging way.

                 - Point to the Challenge Words on the board. Explain to students that the
Challenge Words, _important_ and _children_, are also part of the spelling list
and are words used very often. Neither of the Challenge Words follows
the spelling patterns for this week and needs to be memorized. Use the
Challenge Words in sentences as examples for students: “It is _important_ to
study for your spelling assessment.” “There are 20 _children_ in Mrs. Smith’s
kindergarten class.”


                 - Remind students that this week, they again have a Content Word. Remind

them that the Content Word is a little harder than the other words. (If
students try to spell the Content Word on the assessment and do not get it
right, they will not be penalized. Simply correct it as you do the other words
and applaud their effort. There should not be a penalty for not trying or
misspelling the Content Word. The important thing is they tried something
that was a stretch for them academically.)


                 - Tell students that the Content Word, _ceremonial_, does follow the spelling

patterns for this week as the ‘al’ is pronounced /ə/ + /l/. _Ceremonial_ is a
content-related word because it is an adjective that describes the buildings
in “Akando and Aponi, the Gatherers” in _Native American Stories_ .

  - Review with students the spelling that is most frequently used for the /ə/ +
/l/ sound. (‘al’) Remind students to look at the power bar under the spellings
and the order in which they are sequenced to determine frequency.


  - Tell students that they will also review the ‘tion’ spelling for /sh/ + /ə/ + /n/
and remind them that ‘tion’ is not shown on the Individual Code Chart as it is
three phonemes, but the ‘tion’ spelling is the most common for these sounds.


  - Ask students to tell you which words to list under each of the headers. Briefly
explain the meaning of each word.

  - Practice the words as follows during the remaining time. Call on a student
to read any word on the table. Then have the student use the word in a
meaningful sentence. After the student says the sentence, have them ask
the class: “Does the sentence make sense?” If the class says, “Yes,” then the
student puts a check mark in front of the word and calls on another student
to come to the front and take a turn. If the class says, “No,” have the student
try again or call on another student to come to the front and use the word
in a meaningful sentence. This continues until all of the words are used or
time has run out.

Lesson 6 Alemeda, the Basket Weaver
**139**


I walked slowly towards the shaded area that my
father had **constructed** out of wooden poles and a
covering. I kicked at the dirt as I walked. There were
several of these structures scattered around our village.
Women could be found sitting under them weaving
baskets of various shapes and sizes. They also created a
whole host of other things. Men could be found sitting
together shaping tools for hunting and farming.


All of the women in our village made baskets. Baskets
were very important because they were used for carrying
water, for storing grain, fruits, nuts, and berries, and
even for cooking.


“Sit near me,” my grandmother said as I came and
stood beside her.


I sighed deeply and threw myself down on the
ground next to her.


She smiled and handed me the basket I had begun to
make the day before.


“Our people have been making these baskets since
time began,” she said. “This skill has been handed down
from one **generation** to the next. It is important that
you learn it, Alemeda.” _Alemeda walks through her village._

**Inferential.** In the last paragraph, the grandmother describes how you can’t eat
everything at once. She says, “ _We_ must save the corn we harvest. _We_ must dry
some of the meat we hunt for, _we_ must store the fruits and berries _we_ gather. _We_
must store this food safely so that _we_ can survive during the time when the sun
has turned away from us.” Why do you think the author chose to start each of those
sentences or ideas with _we_ ?


» Answers may vary but could include that the author chose to start each sentence

or idea with _we_ to point out how important the job of basket-making is to the

village and that Alameda should feel good about being included in the group of

basket-weavers.

~~**GRAMMAR: POSSESSIVE NOUNS (15 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask students to orally compare and contrast singular possessive nouns and

plural possessive nouns.


» Both are possessive nouns, show ownership, and are made with the placement of

an apostrophe. Singular possessive nouns show that one person, place, or thing

has or owns something and are formed by adding – _’s_ to singular nouns. Plural

possessive nouns show that more than one person, place, or thing has or owns

something and are formed by adding – _s’_ to singular nouns.

**Possessive Nouns**


A **singular possessive noun** shows that one person, place, or thing has

or owns something. Form a **singular possessive noun** by adding an
apostrophe and ‘s’ to a singular noun. (– _’s_ )


A **plural possessive noun** shows that more than one person, place, or

thing has or owns something. To form a **plural possessive noun** from a
plural noun that ends with ‘s’ or ‘es,’ add only an apostrophe to the plural
noun. (– _s’_ )


If a plural noun does not end with ‘s,’ add – _’s_ to form a **plural**

**possessive noun** .


- Remind students that – _’s_ signals a singular possessive noun and – _s’_ signals
a plural possessive noun.


- Have students tear out Activity Page 6.4 and fold it in half horizontally so
that, when held up, only either – _’s_ or – _s’_ shows.


- Tell students you will read sentences containing singular or plural possessive

nouns. Students will display the correct suffix to match the sentences.


- Read the first sentence:


The kite’s tail is much too long.


- Ask, “Is there a possessive noun in the sentence and, if so, what is it?”


» yes, _kite’s_


- Have students brainstorm to decide whether _kite’s_ refers to one or more
than one kite.


- Direct students’ attention to the rest of the words in the sentence

(context clues).


- Guide students to realize that one kite would have one tail and that many
kites wouldn’t share one tail, so this sentence is singular possessive. (one tail
belongs to one kite)


- Ask students to display the side of their folded activity page that shows – _’s_ .


- Ask students to justify why they should show the – _’s_ side of the activity page.


» A singular possessive noun shows that one person, place, or thing has or owns

something. A singular possessive noun is formed by adding – _’s_ .

                 - Read the next sentence:


He found the twin brothers’ lunchboxes on the playground.


                  - Ask, “Is there a possessive noun and, if so, what is it?”


» yes, _brothers’_


                - Have students brainstorm to decide whether _brothers’_ refers to one brother

or more than one brother, again listening carefully to the rest of the words in
the sentence (context clues).


                 - Guide students to note that the word _twin_ means there were two brothers, so
the possessive noun is plural possessive ( _brothers’_ ).


                  - Have students display the side of their activity page that reads – _s’_ .


                 - Ask students to support why they should show the – _s’_ side of the
activity page.


» A plural possessive noun shows that more than one person, place, or thing has

or owns something. A plural possessive noun is formed by adding an apostrophe

after the ‘s.’


                 - Read the remaining sentences, following the same procedure:

                        - The children filled both of their grandparents’ pockets with love notes.

» _grandparents’_, plural possessive, – _s’_


                        - The wagon’s tire was flat so we couldn’t ride in it.

» _wagon’s_, singular possessive, – _‘s_


                        - Tom’s collection of stamps was fascinating to look at!

» _Tom’s_, singular possessive, – _‘s_


                        - Our closet was full of guests’ coats when my parents invited so many

people to the party.


» _guests’_, plural possessive, – _s’_

**Possessive Nouns**


A **singular possessive noun** shows that one person, place, or thing has

or owns something. Form a **singular possessive noun** by adding an
apostrophe and ‘s’ to a singular noun. ( _–’s_ )


A **plural possessive noun** shows that more than one person, place, or

thing has or owns something. To form a **plural possessive noun** from a
plural noun that ends with ‘s’ or ‘es’, add only an apostrophe to the plural
noun. ( _–s’_ )


If a plural noun does not end with ‘s’, add – _’s_ to form a **plural**

**possessive noun** .


**Universal Access**


  - Review knowledge from the previous lesson about the Pueblo people.

Discuss cause and effect and write the cause and effect graphic on the
board. For example, you might write on the board: “The valley was dry
(cause), so some Pueblo people moved to the raised plateaus or mesas. The
Pueblo learned to grow crops using irrigation (cause), so they had more food
and settled in one place (effect).”


  - Ask students, “What else did we learn about the Pueblo people in an
earlier lesson?” Students can come up to the board and write anything
they remember.


  - This quick mini-lesson reviews and reinforces knowledge from Lesson 5
that will assist students in completing the compare and contrast activity in
today’s lesson. Tell students that today they will compare the Hopi way of life
to the ancient Pueblo way of life. The students will think about each tribe’s
food, homes, customs, and more as we compare and contrast.

foldable. The other students in the group remain seated but raise their
hands. The students who are standing will go to the table of another group
that has their hands up. The students that are seated will put their hands
down when a new teammate joins them. The new student in the group will
share their group’s foldable.


  - Tell students that today they are going to hear about several tribes who
still live in the Southwest and are descendants of the Ancestral Pueblo. Tell
students that one tribe they will hear a great deal about is the Hopi. Ask
students to listen carefully to hear about the ways in which the Ancestral
Pueblo tribes and the Hopi are the same, and ways in which they are
different.


  - During the Read-Aloud, model fluent reading by using appropriate rate

and accuracy. When finished, ask students what they noticed about your
reading. ~~**TEKS 3.4**~~

**Show Image U7.L7.1**
People abandoning the cliff dwelling


Drought and confrontation with other

Native people and with European

explorers resulted in much change





to the Ancestral Pueblo settlements



that had developed slowly over thousands of years in the American

Southwest. The Ancestral Pueblo had developed a way of life that was

heavily influenced by the climate and the environment in which they

lived. But this is not the end of the Pueblo story.


The Ancestral Pueblo people journeyed to other areas in the region

in search of the water supplies needed to maintain their crops,

hoping for a more peaceful way of life. They began to settle in the

areas around the Rio Grande River that are now northern New

Mexico, northern Arizona, central Utah, and southern Colorado. And

so, once again, the Native peoples of the Southwest adapted to their

new, immediate environment, and their culture continued to grow

and change. Descendants of the Pueblo people still reside in these

regions today.


**Show Image U7.L7.2**
People rejoicing over a rainfall


Each year snow fell, as it still does, on

the mountaintops. Rain also fell into the

rivers and streams that flowed through





the valleys of the lands these Native



peoples now occupied. However, in arid areas, there was never enough

water, and surviving in such places was a never-ending struggle.

Despite such struggles, Native groups continued to develop new and

ingenious ways to manage their most precious resource—water.


Unit 7
**154**


Over time, the Ancestral Pueblo adopted some new customs and

beliefs, and they also continued to practice their traditional ways.

Out of this grew new customs, languages, religions, and forms of

government. These new cultural practices developed in the deserts,

mountains, and valleys of this Southwest region. Many tribes came

into existence as a result of their ancestors’ incredible journey across

thousands of years and countless miles. Out of the 21 Pueblo nations

that remain, two of these tribes are the Hopi and the Zuni.


**Show Image U7.L7.3**
Hopi cultivating crops at the bottom
of the mesa


The Hopi, one such tribe born of

this journey, is the group we are





going to focus on today. The word



_Hopi_ means peaceful or wise. The Hopi are the descendants of the

Ancestral Pueblo, but interestingly, their language is not the same.

The Hopi settled in the area that is now Arizona. They were organized

into **clans** with the mother’s side of a family establishing the most

important family connections.


Like most Native people at this time, the Hopi relied on their

environment for all of their needs. The Hopi grew beans, squash,

melons, pumpkins and other types of gourds, cotton, and corn.

Corn was their most important crop, and they learned how to grow

several different kinds. Because of the dry conditions, they learned

how to plant the corn deep into the ground. There the corn crop

could reach underground water sources and also be protected from

the arid conditions above. Also, the Hopi would plant their crops at

the bottom of the mesas, so that after it rained, the water would run

down into their fields and water their crops.

their houses through the ceiling using a ladder. Because of the

environment in which they lived, they ate very little meat, but the

Hopi women, who ran the household, knew many different ways to

cook corn. Hopi people wove cloth for clothing and blankets, and

made moccasins, belts, baskets, pottery, and jewelry.


The Hopi were thought to be a very peaceful people but defended

their territory. For example, when the Navajo people moved into the

region, there were battles between them for land and resources. They

practiced what they called the Hopi Way. They believed they should

be kind to each other and thoughtful toward their environment.

maintain their ancestral lands and



remain devoted to their traditional culture, spirituality and language, which

they teach today in Hopi schools. The Hopi, along with the Zuni and other

existing Native American communities, continue to work hard to keep

their cultures and traditions alive in the modern world, on the land they’ve

inhabited for hundreds of years.

~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (20 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** Describe the homes in which the Hopi lived.


» They were made of stone and clay, with wooden beams; people entered them

through the roofs, using a ladder.


2. **Inferential.** What determined which clan a Hopi belonged to?


» The mother’s side of the family was the most important family connection, and

that determined the clan.


3. **Evaluative.** How do members of the Hopi tribe today maintain their

culture? Why do you think this is important to them?


» Answers may vary.


 - Have students complete Activity Page 7.2: Compare and Contrast Hopi to the

Ancestral Pueblo.


Check for Understanding


If students could not identify comparing and contrasting facts for each
tribe, then provide students with key topics to compare and contrast. (For
example: location of tribes, houses, language, customs, etc.)



Activity Page 7.2


Challenge


After completing
Activity Page 7.2, have
students write a key
statement about the
Native Americans of the
Southwest including
details from both Part 1

~~**REGIONS MAP (15 MIN.)**~~


 - Review Activity Page 2.3: Regions Map.


 - Think-Pair-Share: Ask students to brainstorm characteristics of the region
based on the reading.


   - Possible student responses: area with drought (lack of water) and an area

with mesas.


   - Ask students to compare what they learned about the Native American

groups in the Southwest, with other Native American groups they learned
about in other regions. Students can also compare what they learned
about different Native American nations within the Southwestern region.
Ask students to share both similarities and differences.


Check for Understanding


If students cannot identify characteristics of the region, then go back into
the text and highlight descriptions of the region.

~~**WORD WORK: ADOPTED (5 MIN.)**~~


1. Write the word adopted on the board in cursive and provide an opportunity
for students to apply decoding skills prior to the word being discussed.
Review any obvious syllable patterns at this time.


2. In this lesson you heard that, “the Ancestral Pueblo adopted some new
customs and beliefs, and they also continued to practice their traditional
ways.”


3. Say the word _adopted_ with me.


4. _Adopted_ means accepted or taken as one’s own.


5. The children adopted the customs and traditions of their new country.


6. Have you ever changed your behavior in such a way that you could say you
have adopted a certain kind of behavior? Have you ever adopted a new
tradition or custom? Where were you when you did these things? Be sure to
use the word _adopted_ when you tell about these things.


    - Ask two or three students. If necessary, guide and/or rephrase the
students’ responses to make complete sentences: “I adopted . . . ”


7. What’s the word we’ve been talking about? What part of speech is the
word _adopted_ ?


  - Use a Synonyms and Antonyms activity for follow-up. Ask “What are some
synonyms of _adopted_, or words that have a similar meaning?” Prompt
students to provide words like _accepted, assumed, affirmed, supported,_
_used_, etc. Then ask, “What are some words or phrases you know that are
antonyms, or opposites, of _adopted_ ?” Prompt students to provide words and
phrases like _rejected, denied, disowned_, etc. Guide students to use the word
_adopted_ in a complete sentence: “A synonym for _adopted_ is _accepted_ .”

**READING ACTIVITY: IDENTIFYING AND COMPARING**
~~**CHARACTER TRAITS (20 MIN.)**~~


 - Tell students that in small groups (or partners) they will use their _Native_
_American Stories_ Reader and Activity Pages 1.3 and 1.5, to help identify the
external and internal traits of characters they have read about in this unit.
Tell students that they can use their reader to remind themselves of the
characters in “Etu, the Hunter,” “Akando and Aponi,” the Gatherers,” and
“Alemeda, the Basket Weaver.” Tell students that they already identified Etu’s
character traits from “Etu, the Hunter” in Activity Page 1.3. They can use this
page to help them in today’s activity.


 - Tell students to open their Activity Book to Activity Page 7.4. On the left
side of the page, they will see the stories they have read. They will see two
columns with internal and external traits, as they have seen before. Students
should fill these out for each story with their partners.


 - Tell students that they may describe the main characters or any secondary
characters they read about in the stories. A main character is the
character(s) that the story is mostly about. Secondary or minor characters
are the other characters that are part of the story and often impact the main
character. They may help the plot develop, but are of lesser importance
to the central idea. Ask students to brainstorm some main and secondary
characters they have read about in the _Native American Stories_ Reader.
_(Answers will vary but may include that in “Etu, the Hunter,” Etu is the main_
_character and his family members such as his father, uncle and brothers are_
_the secondary characters.)_


 - Tell students that after they complete this table, they should compare
and contrast the characters with their group. Tell students to answer the
following questions: What traits were similar between the characters across
the stories and which were different? Do you notice any trends in the
character traits? Do any of the character traits you identified connect to
someone in your life, community, or family? _(Answers will vary but should be_
_supported by the text.)_

  - Read with students the Possessive Nouns poster or display Digital Projection
DP.U7.L2.1

) **Projection DP.U7.L2.1**


**Possessive Nouns**


A **singular possessive noun** shows that one person, place, or thing has or
owns something.


Form a **singular possessive noun** by adding an apostrophe and ‘s’ to a
singular noun (– _’s_ ).


A **plural possessive noun** shows that more than one person, place, or
thing has or owns something. To form a **plural possessive noun** from a
plural noun that ends with ‘s’ or ‘es’, add only an apostrophe to the plural
noun. ( _–s’_ ).


If a plural noun does not end with ‘s’, add – _’s_ to form a **plural**
**possessive noun** .


  - Remind students that possessive nouns show ownership.


  - Ask students to read the following sentences aloud and raise their hand
when they reach the word that is underlined. Students will vote for whether
the word they read with their hand raised is plural (by placing their hands
on top of their heads) or plural possessive (by placing their hands on their
shoulders). “The boys on the team were all in uniform.” (plural, hands on tops
of heads)


    - “The boys’ uniforms were green and white.” (plural possessive, hands
on shoulders)

- Pause here, if necessary, to remind students that, although the two words
( _boys_ and _boys’_ ) sound the same, only one shows ownership and is a
possessive noun. (The boys own the uniforms in the second sentence.)


- Ask students to justify how to tell the difference between _boys_ and _boys’_ .


» _Boys’_ is possessive and has an apostrophe. However, this can only be seen in print.


- Using the remaining sentences, follow the procedure outlined above, pausing
to correct any misunderstandings.


  - The stories all had bright covers that were very attractive. (plural, hands
on tops of heads)


  - We were delighted with all the monkeys’ grins. (plural possessive, hands on

**Independent Student Activity Options**


Research Activity


Materials: Globe or world map; reference book such as an encyclopedia or
textbook; computer with Internet access; drawing paper


 - Remind students that they heard that the Native American people in the
Southwest had to find ways to grow crops in an arid climate. Using a globe or
map, ask students to identify other regions or countries in the world where
farmers also have to irrigate their crops in order to grow them. Have students
use locally approved sources to research and write a paragraph about how
people in that region or country find ways to overcome the shortage of water.
Students may also be asked to draw a map of the region or country they
choose to write about.


Research Activity


Materials: Locally approved sources; drawing paper and drawing tools


 - In the Read-Aloud in Lesson 7, “Native Americans of the Southwest, Part 2,”
students learned about the Hopi. Remind them that there were many other
groups with different cultural identities living in the Southwestern region and
that there are groups of Pueblo people still living and thriving today. Give
students the opportunity to use locally approved resources to research the
modern day Pueblo people. Student research may include, but is not limited
to, where they live and the Pueblo traditions they continue to practice. In
their research, students may compare and contrast the architecture of the
Mesa Verde and Chaco Canyon, with that of modern Pueblo architecture
such as the Taos or Acoma Pueblo. See below for a list of additional Pueblo
tribes students can research. You may wish to differentiate by having
some students write a report, whereas others may draw and label pictures
depicting key details of different cultural identities.


 - Have students present their findings to a group or with the class.


   - Acoma


   - Taos


   - Zia


   - San Ildefonso


   - Tribes of the Rio Grande Valley


   - Diné (Navajo)


   - Apache


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures


Writing Prompts


Materials: Paper and pencil


  - Students may be given an additional writing prompt such as the following:


    - You heard that Native American tribes developed a way of life that was
heavily influenced by the climate and the environment in which they lived.
How are you affected by your climate and environment?


    - Can you think of examples that show how we care for the earth, and
examples that show how we don’t?


    - Being a member of a tribe is somewhat similar to being a member of a
community. Every community has its own culture. Can you think of things
that represent our classroom or school community?


    - Do you know of any Native American tribes that live in Texas?


     - You may wish to have students conduct research to answer
this question.


    - You heard that the Native American people lived “in long-term balance with
the environment.” Do you think people today live in long-term balance with
their environment? Do you think it is more difficult today to be in balance
with the environment than it was during this earlier time in history?

stretched from Canada and the Great Lakes south to the Carolinas, and

from the Atlantic Ocean on the East Coast west to the Mississippi River.

This was a time long before Europeans came and made their mark upon

the land. This was a time when some Native peoples made the forests

their home and lived in long-term balance with their environment.


Unlike in the Southwest, rain fell, as it still does, frequently upon most

of this land. And just as today in this region of the Eastern Woodlands,

each season brought with it a different climate and a changing earth.

The same freshwater rivers and lakes, the same imposing mountains

and forests, color the landscape today as they did back then.


As you have already learned, some of the earliest people to settle

across this region were the Mound Builders, whose culture lasted for

thousands of years. They spread out from the Mississippi River and

lived on the surrounding land, hunting in the forests and utilizing the

abundant natural resources available to them. The Native Americans

of the Eastern Woodlands settled in this area.


- Purpose for Listening: Have students listen for the central idea of the
following paragraph.

existence, other groups of people,

formed themselves into tribes. In



fact, the Native Americans of the Eastern Woodlands were made

up of numerous tribes. Some of these tribes included the Iroquois,

Mohican, and Powhatan. Over time these tribes established their

own cultural identities, which included a range of languages spoken

throughout this large area.


Lesson 8 Native Americans of the Northeast
**181**


The Eastern Woodland tribes often interacted with each other.

Sometimes their interactions were peaceful; at other times they were

not. These tribes relied on the land for their very existence. They

guarded their villages, their hunting lands, their crops, and their

settlements from invasion by neighboring tribes.


**Show Image U7.L8.3**
Iroquois in harsh winter making peace


Finally, in search of peace, these

tribes joined together to form the

Iroquois Confederacy, which was





originally made up of five nations:

Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga,



**182**



and Seneca. These nations inhabited a particular part of the Eastern

Woodland region, what is now largely New York and Ohio. In 1722 a

sixth tribe, Tuscarora, joined the Iroquois Confederacy, which was

often called “The Six Nations.” They negotiated and discussed how

they would live peacefully together. As you have heard, the Iroquois

did not call themselves by this name. They called themselves

‘Haudenosaunee’ (hoo-dee-noh-shaw-nee), or people of the

**longhouse** . When peace was made between the five original nations,

the Hiawatha belt was created as a symbol of the nations coming

together. The belt was named after a peacemaker, named Hiawatha,

who told the tribes to think of the Iroquois Confederacy as all five

nations living together in one longhouse. Each nation would have

their own council fire to govern their own people. The belt has five

symbols that represent each original nation, and has since been

fashioned into a flag that is still flown many places around the world.

Once a year, **sachems**, or chiefs, from each of the nations would meet

in a council to make new laws and deal with any new problems that

arose. While the sachems in the Iroquois Confederacy were men, they

were always chosen by women.

Cold woodland landscape


As with all Native peoples, the

landscape helped shape the Iroquois

culture. It greatly influenced what

kinds of houses they built, what

clothes they wore, what food they ate,



how they traveled, what weapons they had, what tools they used,

and even what language they spoke. A typical home for many Native

Americans of the Eastern Woodlands depended more on climate

and available resources than anything else. The three most familiar

kinds of homes across the Northeast region were the longhouse, the

**wigwam**, and a round-roofed clay and pole structure.


- Purpose for Listening: Have students listen for the central idea and
supporting details in the following paragraphs.


**Show Image U7.L8.5**
Single-family wigwam


Because the winter months were

generally cold, with deep snow covering

much of the ground, many Eastern





Woodland tribes—including the

Iroquois—constructed wigwams and



longhouses. Wigwams were rounded structures that looked similar to

wooden igloos and were homes in which individual families lived.


The longhouse and the wigwam were made almost entirely from

wood. In the colder regions of the North, especially around the

Great Lakes, Native peoples constructed wigwams that could be

easily dismantled so that the tribes could, for part of the year, live a

migratory life. During this time of the year they followed the herds

they hunted for their survival.


Lesson 8 Native Americans of the Northeast
**183**


To build a wigwam, young trees were cut down and bent over to form

a rounded frame. Tree bark was placed over the frame. Grasses were

then added to help insulate the home. A small hole in the roof allowed

smoke from the fire inside the home to escape. The family cooked

their food on an open fire and slept on mats. In the wintertime they

used animal furs to keep themselves warm.


- What is the central idea and supporting details of the paragraphs?


» Central idea: Native Americans of the Eastern Woodlands lived in wigwams and

longhouses. Supporting details: Made of wood, easy to dismantle, and had hole in

the roof for smoke to escape.


Check for Understanding


If students could not identify the central idea and supporting details, then
have students identify the central idea in the first paragraph. Next, identify
the supporting details in the following paragraphs.


**Show Image U7.L8.6**
Longhouse with multiple families


Longhouses were much larger than

wigwams and were home to several

families that were related to each other.





The Iroquois considered themselves

to be related to each other through the



**184**



mothers in the tribe. This extended family group was called a clan. Each

clan had an animal name. When a young couple married, they went to

live with the bride’s family.


Some longhouses ranged in size from 50 feet to 150 feet long and

housed as many as fifty people. To construct a longhouse, once again a

frame was made using young trees. Bark was placed over the frame and

was then sewn together. The longhouse had a large central hallway, with

rooms on either side. The family members slept on sleeping platforms.

Some Iroquois still build longhouses today for ceremonies. Just like

other tribes, the Iroquois made baskets and pots in which to store food.


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures


**Show Image U7.L8.7**
Field of three sisters


The Iroquois grew different varieties

of corn and beans. They also grew

squash, sunflowers, and tobacco. They

cleared the land of trees and shrubs

and planted their crops. Corn, beans,



and squash were particularly important crops, and the Iroquois

referred to them as the “three sisters.” Like members of a family, the

three plants helped each other grow. By planting these three plants

together, the Iroquois relied on the natural relationships among these

plants. The corn stalks provided a support for the bean plants, which

would wind around the corn stalks. The squash leaves that lay on the

ground prevented weeds and increased the amount of rainwater that

was absorbed into the soil. Also, the bean plants produced a natural

bacteria that made the soil more fertile for the corn and squash plants.


**Show Image U7.L8.8**
Hunting deer; fishing and gathering


In the wintertime, when food was

scarce, many Iroquois left their

villages to hunt. They moved with the





herds and often did not return to their

villages until early spring. The Iroquois



hunted deer using bows and arrows. Young boys **cloaked** themselves

in deerskin as they stealthily crept through the forest in pursuit of

their prey. They also hunted smaller mammals, setting traps to catch

them. In addition, the Iroquois fished and gathered berries, and

tapped the trees to get maple syrup. Yes, the Iroquois had a sweet

tooth, too!


Like many other tribes, the Iroquois lived near water. Water was a

source of life, and it provided a means of transportation. The Iroquois

traveled in dugout canoes. They fished using nets and traps.

Family in winter clothing and summer
clothing, holding up wampum


Depending on the weather, the Iroquois

wore a range of clothing. In the summer

the men wore a breechcloth, which was



a short piece of buckskin. Women wore dresses made of grass fibers. In

the wintertime, everyone relied on animal furs to keep warm. Men also

wore buckskin moccasins on their feet. They used dyes, beads, and

quills to decorate their clothes, as well as their skin.


Very important to the Iroquois was something called **wampum** .

Wampum was an artistic way of communicating important thoughts

and decisions. Wampum was belts and necklaces made from colored

shells. The color and design of the beads could tell a story, or they

could be a symbolic means of communication. Wampum could also

be used when trading. It was therefore a kind of currency. Wampum

was considered to be very valuable and was an important part of

Iroquois culture.


**Show Image U7.L8.10**

Today many Iroquois continue to follow

and honor their traditional ways. Some

still build longhouses for ceremonies,





and their leaders meet to guard and

protect their ancient culture.

~~**ADVANCE PREPARATION**~~


**Speaking and Listening**

 - Identify Image Card C.U7.L1.1.


 - Identify the following Digital Images in the program’s online materials to
project during the Read-Aloud: U7.L9.1–U7.L9.6.


 - Predetermine four to five small groups.

**Language**

 - On chart paper, create the _Its_ vs. _It’s_ Poster or prepare digital Projection
DP.U7.L9.1.


**Its vs. It’s**


**Its** means “belonging to it” and is a **possessive pronoun**


**It’s** means “it is” or “it has” and is a **contraction**


 - Write the sentences on chart paper or board to be read aloud at the end of
the language portion of this lesson.

**Universal Access**

 - To prepare all students to write a compare/contrast paragraph, create a
Venn diagram on the board. Students can use knowledge and notes from the
Around the Table review activity earlier in class.


 - Ask students, “How did the Northeast and Southeast tribes get their food?”
After soliciting student responses, write In the middle of the Venn diagram:
_Northeast and Southeast tribes hunted, gathered, and fished_ .


 - If possible, have photos or pictures available to assist visual learners. Images
could include corn, beans, squash, pumpkins, or sunflowers and animals like
deer, rabbits, raccoons, or turkeys.


 - As you read the Read-Aloud, note that the children of the tribe helped their
families to survive: “The children of the tribes gathered nuts, berries, and
sap.” Ask students what they do to help their families at home, so they will
relate to the children as they read.


 - Teacher and students can return to the Venn diagram during the Read-Aloud
and add ideas to it, noting how the Northeast and Southeast tribes are
similar and different. You can write prompts beside the Venn diagram, such
as _food, housing, clothing, location_, etc., to give students ideas about what
to include in the diagram and later on Activity Page 9.1, in their compare/
contrast paragraph.

~~**INTRODUCING THE READ-ALOUD (15 MIN.)**~~


  - **Around the Table (10 minutes):** Organize students into groups of four or
five. Each student needs a blank piece of paper and a pencil. Ask students to
recall what they remember about the Native Americans of the Northeast.


  - Have all students in the group respond on their paper by drawing pictures
or writing key words. After three minutes, have students pass their paper
clockwise to the next person. Students should continue to add drawings
and/or key words onto what has already been written on the paper. Continue
to pass papers until each paper is returned to the original owner.


  - Provide support for students to write complete words, thoughts, and
answers legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words on all
assignments in this unit. ~~**TEKS 3.2.D**~~


  - Have students share the responses on their paper with the whole class.


  - Tell students that, over time, many tribes migrated to a part of North America
that experiences a warm, wet climate and has soil that is good for growing
crops. That region of North America is called the Southeast. Have a student
point to the Southeast region on Image Card C.U7.L1.1.


    - Ask, “How do you think this region differs from the Southwest region?”

» Finding enough water to grow crops would not be as challenging.


    - Ask, “How do you think this region differs from the Northeast region?”

» warmer, different vegetation


  - Tell students to listen carefully for information about the tribes that lived in the
southeastern part of North America. They will be hearing about the farming
techniques used by the tribes in this area, the types of structures in which
these people lived, and some of the unique traditions practiced by these
people, including an interesting game they played. Remind students that each
southeastern tribe was unique, and that they will be learning about some of
the tribes today. Be sure to listen for specific ways the Native Americans of the
Southeast are alike or different from the Northeast Native Americans. During the
Read-Aloud, model fluent reading using appropriate accuracy and rate. ~~**TEKS 3.4**~~

Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures


~~**PRESENTING THE READ-ALOUD (20 MIN.)**~~


**Show Image U7.L9.1**
The American Southeast


The American Southeast includes

East Texas, a land filled with **thickets**,

forests, rivers, and **bayous** . It is very





different from the arid American



Southwest. Here, the **subtropical** climate brings frequent rains and

a warm climate. These make farming and ranching easier. For this

reason, East Texas, and the areas around it, became home to many

Native cultures. One of those cultures was the tribes of the Caddo

Confederacy. The people of the Caddo were key to the history of Texas.


The Caddo Confederacy was not a single tribe. It was a group of many

tribes. Each tribe of the Caddo had their own customs, but they all

spoke the same language. The lands of the Caddo went along rivers

and streams in many states. These states included Texas, Oklahoma,

Louisiana, and Arkansas. The Caddo chose to settle in the area because

of the land and the rivers. The rivers were filled with fish to eat. The river

water also carried silt that made the fields good for farming.


  - **Picture Pause:** Have students review the pictures and key words written
about the Northeast tribes on their paper from Around the Table. Provide
students time to compare and contrast information about the Northeast and
Southeast tribes.


  - **Teacher Model:** Explain that on their Around the Table paper, students may
have listed that the Northeast tribes settled in certain areas because they
could find food more easily there. On their paper, they could also add that the
Southeast tribes also settled where food was easily found or grown.


Lesson 9 The Caddo and Tejas
**197**


**Show Image U7.L9.2**
East Texas tribes


The Hasinai (hah-see-nye) was one

of the main Caddo tribes. They made

their home between the Sabine and

Trinity rivers in East Texas. They were



known for their friendly nature. In fact, the Hasinai were referred to by

early Spanish explorers as the _Tejas_ . This was a Caddo word meaning

“friend.” The term would later be used as the name for the entire state

of Texas. It was also chosen as the Texas State Motto in 1930.


The Kadohadacho (kah-doh-hah-dah-cho) tribe lived further north.

They lived along the Red River. They used the river not only to fish

and to water crops but also to connect them to other tribes. The

Kadohadacho built large earthen mounds. These mounds can still be

seen today. Historians know that these mounds were crucial to the

earliest Caddo. Yet we still don’t know for sure why they were built.


**Show Image U7.L9.3**
Trading networks


In Northwest Louisiana, across the

Sabine River, lived the Natchitoches

(nack-uh-tosh) tribe. They traded with





their closest neighbors, the French



**198**



settlers of Louisiana. Because of this, they were among the first

of the Caddo to adapt parts of European culture. They traded for

European goods like metal tools, clothing, and food, which became

part of their daily lives.


Like the Jumano (hoo-mah-no) of Southwest Texas, the Caddo were

known for their vast trading networks. Unsurprisingly, they had close

ties with the Jumano. The Jumano often carried Caddo goods to far
off places. Because of the richness of their lands, the Caddo tribes

often had a **surplus** of crops. These extra crops were used by the

Caddo to trade with others.


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures


- **Picture Pause:** Have students review the pictures and key words written
about the Northeast tribes on their paper from Around the Table. Provide

Southeast tribes.


  - Students may identify that both tribes lived near water and used it as a
means of transportation.

the finest in North America at the

time. The Caddo even traded salt,



which they made by boiling the salty water of the bayous. Between

their surplus crops, pottery, and the rare salt, the Caddo had many

trade partners.


The Caddo were deeply tied to the land that gave them so much.

They grew corn, beans, and squash. These three crops were usually

grown together by Native cultures. The plants supported each other.

Corn stalks gave a structure for bean plants to climb. Bean plants

added special nutrients to the soil. Squash spread out low and

thick on the ground and blocked weeds. The plants relied on each

other so much that Native cultures called them “three sisters.” This

way of planting was common among Native American tribes. You

might remember learning about this system of agriculture before in

Lesson 8. The Caddo were smart farmers, planting two types of corn

throughout the year. That way, they were able to count on having food

for their families even if one harvest went bad.


Lesson 9 The Caddo and Tejas
**199**


**Show Image U7.L9.5**
Caddo beehive homes


The land gave the Caddo other things

they needed too, like materials for

their homes. Those homes looked like

a beehive. They were made from wood



and grass. Their clothing was sometimes made from plant fibers

that were woven together. They made fringed skirts. They also added

beads to their shirts. Careful hunters, they **cloaked** themselves in

deerskins to provide **camouflage** while hunting.


The Caddo cultures were also shaped by the coming of other settlers.

These settlers came from places like Spain, France, and the United

States. The Caddo eventually settled in Oklahoma. Today, their

descendants live in many places across the American Southeast.

Many devote time to keeping the cultural **heritage** of the Caddo alive.


- **Picture Pause:** Have students review the pictures and key words written
about the Northeast tribes on their paper from Around the Table. Provide
students time to compare and contrast information about the Northeast and
Southeast tribes.


  - Students may identify that both tribes used natural resources to build
their homes.


**Show Image U7.L9.6**
Caddo heritage


Places like Caddo Mounds State

Historic Site and the Gahagan Mounds

site have become landmarks in Texas.





People can visit these places and see



**200**



the mounds of the Kadohadacho. They can also see **replicas** of the

Caddo’s famous beehive houses. Caddo Culture Day is celebrated

each fall in Alto, Texas, near the Caddo Mounds State Historic Site.


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures


On that day, visitors can take part in a celebration of Caddo heritage.

They can also learn about the tribe’s history. The Caddo Confederacy

left a strong legacy on the land, culture, and people of Texas. Through

their stories and artifacts, we can still learn about these people.


~~**DISCUSSING THE READ-ALOUD (10 MIN.)**~~


1. **Literal.** What is the subtropical climate of the Southeast like?


» warm with frequent rains


2. **Inferential.** Why did the Spanish explorers refer to the Hasinai as _Tejas_ ?


» _Tejas_ is a Caddo word meaning “friend,” and the Hasinai were known to be a

friendly people.


3. **Literal.** Why did the Caddo have so many trading partners?


» Their land was rich, and they had a surplus of food to trade. They were known to

make the best pottery, and they had salt that was made from water in the bayous


4. **Evaluative.** Read this sentence from the text: “They traded for European goods like
metal tools, clothing, and food which became part of their daily lives.” How do you
think life changed for the Caddo once they began using European goods?


» Answers may vary, but could include that their lives became easier as they had

access to sturdier tools to complete tasks. They also had more access to food to

survive during the cooler months. They could also gain more things to trade to

bring in more money.

» No, they’re homophones.


  - “What are homophones?”


» words that sound the same but have different meanings


  - Point to _its_ on the board and tell students that the word _its_ is a
possessive pronoun.


  - Ask what a possessive pronoun is.


» Possessive pronouns are pronouns that show ownership and are used before nouns.


  - Point to _it’s_ on the board and ask, “What do you think the word _it’s_ means?”


» It is a contraction that means “it is” or “it has.”

**Its vs. It’s**


**Its** means “belonging to it” and is a **possessive pronoun**


**It’s** means “it is” or “it has” and is a **contraction**


  - Tell students that the best way to determine if _its_ or _it’s_ is needed in a
sentence is to replace the word with “it is” or “it has.” If the sentence makes
sense, the contraction _it’s_ is needed. If the sentence doesn’t make sense, the
possessive pronoun _its_ is needed.

 - Use photos and actions to introduce the academic vocabulary.


**horizon,** the line in the distance where the earth or ocean seems to meet the
sky (Show a photo of a sunset over the ocean.)


**channel,** a long, narrow row dug for planting seeds (Show an illustration
from today’s story.)


**store,** to put things away for future use (Ask students, “Where do you store
your toys or clothes when you are not using them?”)


**germinate,** to sprout (Show a photo or picture of corn or another plant
sprouting. Show a time-lapse video of a plant growing.)


**scuttle,** to run quickly and playfully; scamper (Ask students to act out this
motion. This action will help kinesthetic learners.)

 - Later in the lesson, as students read the story “Adoette and Awan, the
Bird Chasers,” their comprehension should increase after learning these
vocabulary words in verbal, visual, and kinesthetic ways. Introducing words in
multiple ways will increase long-term retention.

  - If you would like students to have pens, this is the time to pass them out.


  - Tell students that for this assessment, they will write the words under the
header to which they belong. For example, if you call out the word _unravel_, they
would write that word under the header ‘el’ > /ə/ + /l/. ~~**[ TEKS 3.2.B.i ]**~~


**TEKS 3.2.B** Demonstrate and apply spelling knowledge by (i) spelling multisyllabic words with closed syllables; open syllables; VCe syllables; vowel teams, including digraphs and diphthongs; r-controlled syllables; and final stable syllables; (iv) spelling multisyllabic words with multiple sound-spelling patterns; **TEKS 3.2.D** Write complete words, thoughts, and answers
legibly in cursive leaving appropriate spaces between words.

Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures


~~**SPELLING ANALYSIS DIRECTIONS**~~


**Unit 7, Lesson 10**

  - Students are likely to make the following errors:


    - For ‘al’, students may write ‘el’ or ‘le’.


    - For ‘el’, students may write ‘al’ or ‘le’.


    - For ‘le’, students may write ‘al’ or ‘el’.


    - For ‘tion’, students may write ‘shun’, ‘shin’, or ‘sion’.


  - While the above student-error scenarios may occur, you should be aware
that misspellings may be due to many other factors. You may find it helpful to
record the actual spelling errors that the student makes in the analysis chart.
For example:


    - Is the student consistently making errors on specific letters? Which ones?


    - Is the student consistently making errors at the end of the words?


    - Is the student consistently making errors on particular
beginning consonants?


  - Did the student write words for each feature correctly?


  - Also, examine the dictated sentences for errors in capitalization
and punctuation.

 - If you moved to the Arctic Circle, how would you survive? What would you
bring with you? Ask students to imagine what life might be like for the Inuit
people, who they will learn more about today. Ask students: How would you
stay warm and survive during the coldest weather?


 - Students can use their creativity and realize more about the challenges and
ingenuity required of the Inuit people they will read about today. Then, as
they read the non-fiction passage, they can identify cause and effect and
methods that the Inuit used for survival.


 - As students describe what they would do to survive in a cold climate, you
could encourage them to use clue words: “First, I would pack lots of food.
Then, I would put on my warmest coat. Next, I would .” This will prepare
students for the Read-Aloud lesson.

**Show Image U7.L11.1**
Thule in the Arctic/Subarctic landscape


If it’s possible to survive on a piece of

land, throughout history, people have

tried to do so. It is thought that the





ancestors of the Inuit—the people of



**234**



the Thule culture—migrated from Asia to the frozen lands of the north

to Greenland, Alaska, and Canada about 1,000 years ago. The people

of the Thule culture were not the first people to live in this frozen part

of the world. The Inuit are the descendants of these ancient people,

and in this Read-Aloud you will be learning about the Inuit, in addition

to more about the Thule. The Inuit actually called the Thule “Tunit.”


This cold part of the world that became home to the people of the

Thule culture is known as the Arctic/Subarctic. The Arctic is a harsh,


**TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text.

frozen, yet stunningly beautiful place. Just like the other Native

Americans you have heard about, the people of the Thule culture

originally came from Asia.


**Show Image U7.L11.2**
Thule hunting bowhead whale


Like most people who migrated a

long, long time ago, the Thule moved

from place to place in pursuit of food,





shelter, and land to live on. If you



choose to live in a place where much of the land is frozen, an ocean

or a lake will have to provide many of the things you need to survive.

In particular, the people of the Thule culture relied heavily on hunting

a very large whale called the bowhead whale. Every part of the whale

enabled the people of the Thule culture to survive. One whale could

keep a village alive throughout an entire winter.


- Purpose for Listening: Have students listen carefully to identify the process
described in the next paragraph.


Show Image U7.L11.3


Thule village


The people of the Thule culture lived in

villages of about six to thirty houses.

The houses were dug into the ground.





Whalebone, stone, driftwood, and sod



made up the frames of the houses. They built snow homes, or _igloos_,

in the winter months as they moved from place to place, hunting as

they went. The people of the Thule culture used dogs to pull sleds

made out of driftwood and whalebones. They used the bones and

teeth of the animals they hunted to hunt the same animals. They built

boats out of walrus ribs and walrus hides, and hunted at sea in the icy

waters. They used lamps powered by seal and whale oil.


Lesson 11 Native Americans and the Arctic/Subarctic
**235**


- Teacher Model: Ask, “What process did you hear described?”


» The passage described the process of creating homes for the Arctic/Subarctic

Native Americans.


- On Activity Page 11.2, complete Part 1 as a whole group.


» 1 [st] box: Houses were dug into the ground; 2 [nd] box: whalebone, stone, driftwood,

and sod made up the frames of the houses


- Ask the students, “How would we rewrite this process using clue words to
help the reader?”


» First, houses were dug into the ground. Then, frames of the houses were made

with stone, driftwood and sod.


- Purpose for Listening: Have students listen carefully to explain how events
connect to one another in the following paragraph.


**Show Image U7.L11.4**
Thule migrating


It seems that during the period of a

mini-ice age that swept across the

world, the people of the Thule culture





found it even more difficult to survive.



Support


Remind students that
a _cause_ is what makes
something happen or why
it happens, and the _effect_ is
what happens. Explain that
the cause always happens
first but is not always
written first.


Challenge


Have students determine
the cause and multiple
effects in the paragraph.


**236**



Once the colder climate came, and the ice formed over the once

free-moving ocean, the whales that the people of the Thule culture

relied on disappeared. Essential plants disappeared, too. Scientists

believe that, just as with other Native groups, when faced with great

hardship, the people of the Thule culture began to migrate. It seems

that they began to migrate east in search of food, shelter, and land.


- Ask students, “How did the author organize the information in this part of the
Read-Aloud?”


» Cause and effect


- Tell students that they they will work with a partner to describe the process
they heard about in the first box. In the second box, they should rewrite the
process using clue words.


- Have partners share their responses.


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures


Check for Understanding


If students cannot identify the cause-and-effect events in the text, then
review basic cause-and-effect relationships. Example: Cause—The cord
was in the man’s path; Effect—The man fell. Effect—Sonia scored 100
percent on her math test; Cause—because she studied.


Not all of the people of the Thule culture left, though, and many years

later another group of people arrived either by boat or on foot across

the frozen ocean. These people joined with the Thule and created a

new group. We call these “new” people the Inuit, and they made their

home in the frozen lands of North America.

withstand the harsh conditions. The



Inuit were a nomadic hunting and gathering people. Over time the

older Thule culture merged with the new culture, and _Inuit_ became

the name of the dominant culture. Interestingly, historians think that

it is possible that the Inuit once lived in Greenland and Iceland before

moving farther south in the Arctic/Subarctic region. The Inuit may

have encountered Vikings in Greenland, and the Vikings may have left

Greenland for various reasons, including conflicts with the Inuit.


Historians are not completely sure what happened during this early

part of Inuit migration. What we do know though is that the Inuit

culture did take hold, and these people found new and ingenious

ways of surviving in such an inhospitable region.



Lesson 11 Native Americans and the Arctic/Subarctic
**237**


**Show Image U7.L11.6**
Inuit hunting, fishing, and gathering


Although the Inuit did hunt whales out

in the open waters, they also relied

heavily on fishing, catching seals and

walruses, and hunting **caribou** and



**238**



other smaller mammals. The Inuit hunted the caribou not only for

meat, but also for its very warm fur. Caribou fur was used to make

all kinds of clothes, from coats to leggings, hats, and gloves. Also,

unlike the other regions of America that you have heard about, it was

and is impossible to farm in the Arctic/Subarctic. However, during

the spring and summer months, it is possible to gather berries and

seaweed and collect eggs. These things the Inuit did.


- Purpose for Listening: Have students listen carefully to explain how events
connect to one another in the following paragraph.


It is believed that the Inuit, along with the Aleut people, invented

the _kayak_ . A kayak is a light, one-person boat that can be used

for hunting or transportation. An Inuit kayak moved swiftly and

silently and was powered by a double-bladed paddle. The Inuit used

whalebones for the frame, covering it with stretched animal skins,

such as seal skin. They then covered the skins with whale fat. The fat

made the kayak watertight.


- Ask the students, “How did the author organize the information in this part of
the Read-Aloud?”


» Sequence of events


- Ask students to identify the sequence of events from the paragraph and
record their response on Activity Page 11.2. Rewrite the paragraph using clue
words on the line provided.


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures


**Show Image U7.L11.7**
Inuit dog sled and dogs


Without the ability to farm, the Inuit

had to move across the snow and ice
covered land in pursuit of the animals

they hunted. As this became the only



way to survive, they perfected a way to travel and a way to build

igloos so that they were safe and snug.


Just like the people of the Thule culture, the Inuit made well-crafted

sleds. Inuit sleds were made out of animal bones and seal “rope.” The

Inuit were skilled dog trainers, and these sleds were pulled by well
trained dogs. In fact, scientists believe that when the mini-ice age

occurred, it would not have been possible for Inuit to have survived

in the frigid Arctic without the stamina and loyalty of the sled dogs.

The Inuit took the skills already developed by the people of the Thule

culture and developed them even further.


The Inuit trained their dogs to not only pull heavy sleds that could

weigh hundreds of pounds fully loaded, they also trained them to

sniff out seal breathing holes. The Inuit mostly used male dogs that

were hitched together. Inuit dogs could and would also hunt down

polar bears.


**Show Image U7.L11.8**
Cross-section of igloo interior


Traditionally, in the wintertime, the

Inuit lived in igloos. The word _igloo_ is

the Inuit word for shelter. The Inuit





igloo was shaped like a dome. The



igloo had a tunnel entrance that trapped cold air so that it could not

enter the main part of the home. Igloos were made from hard blocks

of snow. These homes were not made to last because the Inuit moved

frequently, hunting and trapping animals. In the warmer months, the


Lesson 11 Native Americans and the Arctic/Subarctic
**239**


Inuit lived in tents made from caribou or sealskin.


The Inuit also had a unique way of greeting one another. Although we

might greet one another by shaking hands, the Inuit would do so by

rubbing noses.


The ancient Inuit people were very talented artists. They carved

beautiful animal figures out of bone, walrus ivory, and caribou antlers.

They made many of their weapons, tools, and utensils this way, too.


**Show Image U7.L11.9**
Modern Inuit


The Inuit are thought to be the last

group of Native people to have arrived

in North America. Because of this, and





the fact that they made their home



**240**



in the frozen north, it could be said that their culture encountered,

or came into contact with, less of the overwhelming influence of the

European settlers. As is true of the other groups of Native Americans

today, many of the Inuit of today are a modern people. Many of them

use snowmobiles instead of sleds, which Inuit people refer to as

“snow machines,” and most use igloos not for their main dwellings

but only as temporary homes on hunting expeditions. Much of their

ancient language and customs, however, are still a part of their

everyday lives.

 - Determine small groups in advance.

**Universal Access**

 - During today’s lesson, you will discuss the definition of a legend: “a story
that has been passed down orally or in writing and sometimes offers an
explanation of how something came to be.” Students will be reading a Native
American legend. Ask students if they have read (or heard) a legend before.
Maybe a parent or grandparent has told the story of a legend from the
family’s culture. Maybe the students have read a book of legends at home or
at school. Maybe they saw a movie based on a legend. You can suggest these
ideas if students do not share examples of legends.


 - Choose one example suggested by students, or selected by you, and discuss
how the legend meets these criteria:


1. Who were the characters in the legend? Who was the hero and how was he

or she exaggerated?


2. What was the setting/where did the story take place?


3. What were the main events in the legend?


4. What lesson could you learn from listening to or reading the legend? What

was the theme?


 - Tell students that together they will be able to answer these questions after
they read a story about a girl who loved to paint and how her painting and a
special paint color ended a long drought.

~~**INTRODUCING THE READING (10 MIN.)**~~


  - Ask the students, “Who can tell me what a legend is?”


  - Explain that a legend is a story about a person or an event from the past that is
believed by many people to be true, but that cannot be proven to be absolutely
true. Explain that some events and people in legends may also be greatly
exaggerated, or described as larger and/or greater than they really were. Tell
students that legends are stories that have been passed down orally or in
writing and sometimes offer an explanation of how something came to be.
Explain to students that the story they will read today is a legend or myth that
explains the end of a drought and why red wildflowers bloom every spring in
Texas when the rains fall. ~~**TEKS 3.9.A**~~


  - On the board write:

    - Characters: heroes are exaggerated

    - Settings: real places and times

    - Plot (Sequence of Events): gives an explanation of how something came
to be

    - Theme: lesson (or an important message)

    - Summary: a brief retelling that includes the main points of a story

  - Review with students the concepts from Lesson 2. Write on the board the
following words: _setting_, _characters_ and _mood_ . Review the questions readers
can ask themselves when looking at illustrations: ~~**TEKS 3.6.B**~~

    - Setting: What does the author want to show us in the illustration about
the setting? What additional information can the reader learn about the
setting from looking at the illustration?

    - Characters: What does the artist want to show us in the illustration about
the characters? What additional information can the reader learn about
the characters by looking at the illustration?

    - Mood: How does the illustration help create the mood? Is the illustration
dark or bright?


~~**INDEPENDENT READING: “TEXAS PAINTBRUSH” (30 MIN.)**~~


  - Tell students that the title of today’s chapter is Texas Paintbrush.


  - Ask students to turn to the table of contents, locate the chapter, and then

gripped the land. Rain refused to fall.



The sun burned hot and fierce. The once green hills lay brown and

wilted. The rivers and streams slowly dried up until even the strongest

were mere trickles. The buffalo herds the Comanche depended on

were drifting further and further away.


The dry days became weeks, and the weeks became months. And still,

the drought remained.


“I fear the worst,” one of the elders said one night at the council fire.

The other elders nodded. There was less and less food to be found for

the people of the tribe.


“All we have stored for the winter is pemmican,” another elder

grumbled. “Old **pemmican**, and not enough of it.” There was more

muttering around the fire. “We should leave these lands for greener

pastures, where the rain still falls and the rivers flow.”

Voices rose in protest. As hard as things were, few wanted to leave on

a long journey to unknown lands. Finally, the eldest and wisest of the

elders stood up. “We must remain hopeful and strong,” the elder **urged**

them. “Until the rains come and the grass grows.”


**Show Image U7.L12.2**
Bright Feather gathering roots and berries


It was during this troubled time that

a young Comanche girl named Bright

Feather was growing up. She was gifted





with a heart full of hope and a talent to



paint. Each day, she wandered the plains, picking up roots and berries.

Once she **crushed** them and mixed them with water, she would have

paints of the most **vibrant** colors. She used brushes made from the

finest **hind** fur of a deer. Sometimes, the entire tribe would gather to

watch her paint and marvel at the result.


“Bright Feather’s paintings are the brightest things in these dark days,”

the elders said.


Her most prized item was a small jar with paint made from a special

flower that had not bloomed since her grandmother’s time. The paint

was a bright red, as vivid as a raging prairie fire. Many times, she had

thought about using the paint, but each time, she stopped herself. “I

only have enough to use once,” she thought to herself. “Then it will be

gone forever.”


**Show Image U7.L12.3**
Bright Feather paints


One hot night, Bright Feather had a

dream. In her dream, she was standing

on a hill looking over her tribe, watching





the sun set. As the sun slowly sank, it lit


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures


the sky with colors more dazzling than anything she had seen before.

The light touched the brown land, and suddenly, it began to bloom. The

grass grew green and tall. The streams filled with clear rushing water.

Life returned to the land around her.


When she woke, Bright Feather was filled with hope. She set out to

bring her dream to life. She gathered her paints and brushes and

set out for the hill outside her tribe. She began to paint. With each

stroke of the brush, the painted sunset grew brighter and fuller. The

Comanche people began to drop by the hillside to watch as Bright

Feather painted.


Day after day, she painted without rest or food or water. She knew that

something was missing from her painted sunset.


“It is beautiful,” one woman told her.


“Almost as bright as the real thing,” another assured her.


“It is not bright enough,” Bright Feather said firmly and kept painting.


Finally, she realized what was needed. With a heavy heart, she took

her cherished jar of vibrant red paint and used it to finish her painting.

Members of the tribe stood around her, gazing at her painted sunset.

They marveled at the stunning colors. It gave them hope that the hard

times could not last.


**Weary** but satisfied, Bright Feather set her brushes down, still stained

red with the last of her cherished paint. Then, she fell into a deep sleep.


**Show Image U7.L12.4**
After the drought


When she woke up, she found that her

paintbrushes had sprouted roots. The

grass of the hillside was now covered





with flowers of the same fiery red as her

**251**


cherished paint. Looking around, she saw that the plains around the

land, as far as the eye could see, were blanketed in the same vibrant

colors—the colors of the setting sun in her painting.


Seeing the flowers, one of the elders said, “They remind me of a prairie

fire. We should call them that.”


Bright Feather shook her head and said, “No, we should call them

paintbrushes.”


Just as in her dream, the rains began to fall. Green grass grew amongst

the red flowers. The rivers filled, and the buffalo herds returned. The

land once again began to thrive, thanks to Bright Feather.


**Show Image U7.L12.5**
Texas wildflowers


Even today, the beautiful red paintbrush

flowers bloom every spring in Texas

when the rains fall. They remind us of





Bright Feather’s hope and creativity,

and the power of selflessness. And mostly, they remind us that even in

the hardest of times, hope remains.

that each group included.


  - After all groups have presented, ask the whole class: Which characters shaped
the tale the most? (Bright Feather and the elders) What are the most important
points in this tale? (Bright Feather’s painting results in the flourishing of the
flowers known as prairie fire, or paint brushes, which blanket the Texas hillsides
each spring. Like many Native American legends, the story not only explains the
presence of a natural phenomenon like a flower, but also provides a life lesson in
resilience, selflessness, and the power of hope in hard times.)

Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures


~~**ACTIVITIES**~~


**Compare and Contrast: Graphic Organizer**


Materials: Student Readers, Activity Books, paper and pencils


  - Have students compare and contrast Native Americans of the Northeast and
of the Southeast by creating their own graphic organizer. Tell students that
may include categories such as location, family structures, foods, housing,
daily life, etc.

**Central Idea: Read, Remember, Retell**


Materials: _Native American Stories_


  - Divide students into partners. Make sure they have their Readers. Direct
them to choose any of the following chapters: “Meda and Flo, the Forest
Children,” “Alemeda, the Basket Weaver,” “Adoette and Awan, the Bird
Chasers,” and/or “Yutu, the Dog Trainer.”


  - In partners, have the students silently read a paragraph in the text. Next,
the students will turn to their partners, cover up what they read, and try to
remember and retell what they read—making sure to include the central
idea and supporting details. Their partner will listen and fill in any missing
information. When finished, both partners will look at the paragraph to
double-check their responses for accuracy. For the next paragraph, the
partners can switch roles remembering and retelling. Continue going back
and forth until the end of the chapter.

**Compare and Contrast: Murals**


Materials: Three, five-foot lengths (or whatever length is deemed appropriate)
of chart paper; one marked with the title “Northeast,” a second entitled
“Southeast,” and a third entitled “Arctic/Subarctic”; colored washable markers


  - Place each piece of chart paper along with markers on a worktable or other
smooth non-textured surface (for drawing purposes).


  - Divide students into small groups. Have each group decide which single
category of items they want to depict for each of the three Native
American groups.


  - Possible item categories (examples): clothing, Native foods, cooking items
(pottery, baskets, gourds, etc.), types of homes/shelters, environments
(forest, foothills, mountains, coastal plain, tundra), water (river, lake, ocean,
swamp, bog), and others.


Pausing Point 2
**257**


**258**




 - When the murals are complete, hang them up around the room and allow
students to walk around to view and discuss how the Native American
groups are alike and different.

**Morphology: Tic-Tac-Toe**


Materials: Card stock and pencils


 - Create simple tic-tac-toe cards. In each square write possessive endings
and suffixes taught in Lessons 8–12. On round, cut-out pieces of card stock,
write the root/base words that can change meaning by adding one of the
suffixes written in the tic-tac-toe squares or that change a noun/pronoun to
a possessive form. Teacher can create a list of possible correct answers for
students to check.


 - Students score a point every time they successfully pronounce and spell the
new word created by placing a round piece on one of the squares.


 - The new word must be listed on the list of possible correct answers in order
to “count.” A third student who is not playing can be put in charge of this
answer list.

**Oral Presentation: Poetry Slam**


Materials: Paper and pencils; colored markers of tempera paint


 - Have students write a short poem about something they learned about Native
Americans in Lessons 8–12. Have them practice reciting their poems orally.


 - Have them create illustrations that display important ideas from their poems.


 - Hold a Native American Poetry Slam and have students present their poems
and displays.

**You Be the Illustrator**


Materials: _Native American Stories_ ; blank paper


 - Have students create new illustrations for stories in their Reader. When
students have completed their new illustrations, share with the whole class or
a partner to determine if peer(s) can place the illustration in the correct story.

50m



**Primary Focus:** Students will demonstrate comprehension of stories they read





~~**STUDENT SKILLS ASSESSMENT (50 MIN.)**~~


**Note:** Students will complete an assessment by reading three selections

during one sitting and answering comprehension, grammar, morphology,

and dictionary skills questions that follow each selection. Students will not

read out of _Native American Stories_ but from Activity Page 13.1, where the

selections have been printed.


  - Have students tear out Activity Page 13.1.


  - Tell students they will read three selections printed on Activity Page 13.1
and answer comprehension, morphology, grammar, and dictionary skills
questions that follow each selection.


  - Tell students that, should they feel tired, it’s a good idea to take a short,
personal break. Explain to students that they need to respect the others
in the classroom and stay seated, while quietly looking up to the ceiling,
stretching their shoulders, and taking a deep breath or two.


  - Tell students they should go right on to the second selection once they have
finished the first and right on to the third selection once they have finished
the second.


  - Encourage students to do their best.


  - Once students finish all three selections, encourage them to review their
papers, rereading and looking over their answers carefully.


  - Again, explain the necessity of respecting that not all classmates will finish at
the same time, and, if they finish and have checked their papers, they should
remain quiet and allow others to finish.


  - When time permits, score these assessments using the guidelines at the end of
this lesson to evaluate each student’s mastery of the skills taught in this unit.

Answers may vary but should include the following information:


    - Etu hunted mammoths for the first time with the other men in his family.


    - Adoette and Awan chased crows away from the family cornfield, and
Adoette found an injured crow.


    - Akando and Aponi helped gather fruits, nuts, and berries to be preserved
for the winter.


    - Alemeda practiced weaving baskets with her grandmother even though
she wanted to hunt instead.


    - Aponi participated in his first Bean Dance Ceremony.


    - Meda and Flo helped collect sap from maple trees for making syrup.


    - Yutu trained Miki, the runt of the litter, to be an Inuit sled dog.

Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures


 - Tell students that they will compare and contrast two groups of Native
Americans they have read about. They will examine and discuss how these
groups are similar and different.


 - Have students take out Activity Page 13.2. Point out that they will be
comparing Etu and his way of life with that of Akando and Aponi.


 - Read the topic categories on Activity Page 13.2 with students and point out
that, as they review the chapters during this lesson, these are the topics they
will want to note information about.


 - Ask students to turn to the table of contents, find “Etu, the Hunter,” and
then turn to the first page of the chapter. You may choose to either read the
chapter aloud to students to refresh their memory or have students choral
read the chapter with you. Alternately, you may choose to have students take
turns reading the chapter aloud.


 - Guide students through answering the questions related to Etu. You may
want to refer students back to the character picture and map on **pages 4–5**
as needed. The following information may be helpful in supporting students
as they fill in the chart:



Activity Page 13.2












|Topic|“Etu, the Hunter”|
|---|---|
|**Where does he/do they live, and what is**<br>**the climate?**|In the northwest part of North America;<br>it is cold and windy, there is snow on<br>the ground|
|**Clothing?**|Made from skin and fur of mammoths|
|**How do they get food?**|Hunt mammoths, dry and save<br>the mammoth meat until the next<br>successful hunt|
|**What else is important to the**<br>**character(s)?**|Have to take care when hunting in order for<br>it to be a successful hunt|




  - Next, ask students to turn to the table of contents, find “Akando and Aponi,
the Gatherers,” and then turn to the first page of the chapter. You may choose
to either read aloud the chapter to students to refresh their memory or have
students choral read the chapter with you. Alternately, you may choose to
have students take turns reading the chapter aloud.


  - Now, guide students through answering the questions related to Akando
and Aponi. You may want to refer students back to the character picture and
map on **pages 4–5** as needed. The following information may be helpful in
supporting students as they fill in the chart:


Lesson 13 Unit Assessment
**263**


|Topic|“Akando and Aponi, the Gatherers”|
|---|---|
|**Where does he/do they live,**<br>**and what is the climate?**|In central North America; they experience seasons|
|**Clothing?**|Aponi wearing a short-sleeved dress that does not<br>entirely cover her legs; Akando wearing only a piece<br>of cloth over the bottom half of his body and no<br>shirt; barefoot|
|**How do they get food?**|Collect wild fruits, berries, nuts, onions, milkweed<br>to be preserved; grow crops of sunfowers, corn,<br>squash, tobacco|
|**What else is important to the**<br>**character(s)?**|Only spiritual leaders can collect tobacco, roots, and<br>bark for medicine|




- Now, give students a few moments to examine the information they have
written in the chart. Tell them to look for similarities and differences between
the two groups.


- Next, engage students in a discussion of the similarities between the two
groups. Have students record information on Activity Page 13.2 in the
appropriate place. (Answers may vary but could include that both groups
have to go get food for themselves.)


- Then, engage students in a discussion of the differences between the two
groups. Have students record information on Activity Page 13.2 in the
appropriate place. (Answers may vary but could include that Etu and his
people hunt for food while Akando and Aponi gather food from nature and
grow crops. Etu and his people wear thick clothes made from mammoth skin
and fur, and he wears shoes, while Akando and Aponi experience seasons
and don’t need thick clothing all the time, and they are barefoot.)


- Tell students that they can think about comparing and contrasting other
Native American groups in this same manner as they read.

**Primary Focus:** Students will read text aloud for an optional fluency assessment.

~~**TEKS 3.4**~~


~~**OPTIONAL FLUENCY ASSESSMENT (20 MIN.)**~~ ~~**TEKS 3.4**~~


**“The Taos Pueblo”**


  - You may wish to assess students’ fluency in reading using any of the
supplemental chapters that they have not yet read. Recording and Scoring
Sheets have been specifically included for “The Taos Pueblo.”


  - **Instructions for Student Fluency Assessment:** Turn to the text copy of
“The Taos Pueblo” at the end of this lesson. This is the text copy students will
read aloud.


  - Ask the student to remove Activity Pages 13.3 and 13.4 from their Activity
Book. Use this worksheet to mark as a running record as you listen to the
student read orally.


  - Tell the student that you are going to ask them to read the selection aloud.
Explain that you are going to keep a record of the amount of time it takes
them to read the selection. Also explain to the student that he or she should
not rush but rather read at their regular pace.


  - Begin timing when the student reads the first word of the selection. If you are
using a watch, write the exact Start Time, in minutes and seconds, on your
record page. If you are using a stopwatch, you do not need to write down the
Start Time since the stopwatch will calculate Elapsed Time. As the student
reads the selection, make a running record on the copy with the student’s
name using the following guidelines:

|Words read correctly|No mark is required.|
|---|---|
|**Omissions**|Draw a long dash above the word omitted.|
|**Insertions**|Write a caret (^) at the point where the insertion was<br>made.<br>If you have time, write down the word that<br>was inserted.|
|**Words read incorrectly**|Write an “X” above the word.|
|**Substitutions**|Write the substitution above the word.|
|**Self-corrected errors**|Replace the original error mark with an “SC.”|
|**Teacher-supplied words**|Write a “T” above the word (counts as an error).|



**TEKS 3.4** Use appropriate fluency (rate, accuracy, and prosody) when reading grade-level text.

 - When the student finishes reading the chapter, write the exact Finish Time
in minutes and seconds on your record sheet. Alternatively, if you are using
a stopwatch, simply write down the Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. If
the student does not read to the end, draw a vertical line on the record sheet
to indicate how far they read before you stopped them. Also write down
either the Finish Time or the Elapsed Time. After the student finishes reading
orally, you may direct them to finish reading the remainder of the selection
silently; you may also assess comprehension by having the student complete
the comprehension questions orally.


Oral Comprehensive Questions on “The Taos Pueblo”


1. **Literal.** What is a pueblo?


» a Native American village


2. **Literal.** How long have people been living in the Taos Pueblo?


» about 1,000 years


3. **Literal.** Who was Popé?


» a Native American leader who urged other pueblos to revolt against converting to

Christianity


4. **Literal.** What is it like to live in an old pueblo like this one?


» old-fashioned: houses have only two rooms, there is no electricity, there are no

pipes or running water, many had very little furniture


 - Repeat this process for additional students. Scoring can be done later,
provided you have kept running records and jotted down either the Elapsed
Time or the Start Time and the Finish Time.


Unit 7 Native American Regions and Cultures


**Guidelines for Calculating W.C.P.M. Scores**

  - If the reading was fairly accurate (< 10 uncorrected errors), you can get a
rough (and easy) estimate of a student’s W.C.P.M. score simply by noting the
time and looking at the chart on Activity Page 13.4.


  - To calculate a student’s exact W.C.P.M. score, use the information you wrote
down on the record sheet and follow the steps described below. The steps
are also shown in graphic form on Activity Page 13.4. You will probably find it
helpful to have a calculator available.


1. First complete the Words section of Activity Page 13.4.


2. Count Words Read. This is the total number of words that the student

read or attempted to read, up to the point where he or she stopped. It

includes words that the student read correctly as well as words that

the student read incorrectly or skipped over. If the student attempted

to read the whole selection, use 423 words total. If the student did not

finish the selection, you will need to count the number of words that the

student actually attempted to read. Write the count for Words Read in the

matching box on Activity Page 13.4.


3. Count the Uncorrected Mistakes noted in your running record. This

includes words read incorrectly, omissions, substitutions, and words that

you had to supply. Write the total in the box labeled Uncorrected Mistakes

on Activity Page 13.4. (A mistake that is corrected by the student is not

counted as a mistake; the student is penalized for the time he or she lost

making the correction, but not for the initial mistake.)


4. Subtract Uncorrected Mistakes from Words Read to get Words Correct.


5. Next complete the Time section of the Activity Page.


6. Calculate Elapsed Time in minutes and seconds. (If you used a
stopwatch, this should already be done for you. Skip to the next step.)
If you used a watch and recorded Start and Finish Times, you will
need to subtract the Start Time from the Finish Time to calculate the
Elapsed Time. Subtract seconds from seconds and then minutes from
minutes. Calculate Time in Seconds. Multiply the number of minutes
by 60 to convert minutes to seconds, and then add the number
of seconds.


7. Next complete the W.C.P.M. section of the worksheet.


Lesson 13 Unit Assessment
**267**


**268**



8. Divide Words Correct by Time in Seconds. Then multiply by 60 to get

Words Correct Per Minute (W.C.P.M.).


- As you evaluate W.C.P.M. scores, here are some factors to consider:


  - It is normal for students to show a wide range in fluency and in W.C.P.M.
scores. However, a major goal for Grade 3 students is to read with
sufficient fluency to ensure comprehension and independent reading of
school assignments in subsequent grades. Exact fluency targets vary from
state to state; the national mean calculated by Hasbrouck and Tindal in
2006 for Spring of Grade 3 is 107 W.C.P.M.


  - A student’s W.C.P.M. score can be compared with the scores of other
students in the classroom (or grade level) and also with the national
fluency norms for Spring of Grade 3 obtained by Hasbrouck and Tindal.
Students whose scores are below the 25th percentile (78 W.C.P.M.) are
experiencing serious problems in reading fluently.

**The Taos Pueblo**


A pueblo is a Native American village. Te Taos Pueblo is located 12


in New Mexico. Te houses in the Taos Pueblo are made of stone and 26


mud. Te mud is called adobe. 32


Te houses in the pueblo are built side-by-side. In some cases, they 44


are built one on top of another. From a distance, the pueblo looks like 58


it is all one building. But that is not the case. In fact, it is made up of 76


many houses. Te houses share walls, but they are separate. 86


Tere are many pueblos in the Southwest. Te Taos Pueblo is one of 99


the oldest. It was built about 1,000 years ago. People have been living in 113


it ever since. It is the oldest continuously inhabited town in the United 126


States. 127


Tere were Native Americans living in the Taos Pueblo when 137


Christopher Columbus set sail in 1492. Some of those people were 148


still alive in 1540, when Coronado explored the Southwest. One of 159


Coronado’s captains visited Taos. 163


Eventually, the Spanish took over the Southwest. Many Native 172


Americans began to follow the teachings of Christianity. But some resisted. 183


In 1680 a Native American leader named Popé planned to resist. 194


Lesson 13 Unit Assessment

**Recording Copy**

**The Taos Pueblo**


Popé used the Taos Pueblo as his base. From Taos, he sent 206


messages to other pueblos. He urged the Native people to fght against 218


the Spanish. He set a date. 224


He wanted all of the Native people to rise at the same time. The 264


Pueblo Revolt was a success, at least at first. The Native Americans 250


drove the Spanish out. For 10 years, they ruled themselves. In the 262


end, however, the Spanish took over once again. 268


The Taos Pueblo remained part of the Spanish Empire for many 279


years. Eventually, New Mexico became part of the United States. 289


Today, the Taos Pueblo is part of a Native American reservation. 300


About 100 people live in the pueblo today. Some of them are 312


descendants of the men who greeted Coronado’s men; others are 322


descendants of men who fought with Popé. 329


What is it like to live in the Taos Pueblo? It is an old-fashioned 343


sort of life in some ways. Most of the houses have only two rooms. 357

**The Taos Pueblo**


One room is for sleeping. The other is for cooking and eating. The 370


houses in the pueblo do not have electricity. They don’t have pipes 382


and running water, either. 386


In the old days, the Pueblo people had very little furniture. Nowa- 397


days, most Pueblo houses have tables, chairs, and beds. So what do 410

“I had an excellent day in school,” said Hazel, as she hopped

into the car and buckled her seatbelt.


Hunter smiled. Curious to hear more, he casually asked his

little sister, “Why? What did you learn today?”


“At recess, we used our imaginations and made a castle for

animals who live in the jungle. It was fun,” said Hazel. “We

worked on our snail survival investigation during Science,

and after that we read a story about the Ancestral Pueblos

from this area.”


Hunter’s eyes sparkled. “I love learning about the people who

came before us. What was the story about?”


“The title of the story was ‘Alemeda, the Basket Weaver,’”

explained Hazel. “It was about an Indigenous, or Native,

girl who lived in the American Southwest. Her people had a

tradition of making baskets. The basket construction skills

were passed down from mother to daughter. Alemeda would

rather hunt, so she hid. But her little brother revealed where

she was, and her mother reminded her that she must do her

work. Almeda learned that baskets woven by the Ancestral

Pueblo were both traditional and important for survival.”


“Wow,” said Hunter. “That reminds me of a project our

Aunt Mabel was talking about. She works with a national

organization of Native Americans in Arizona. They help teach

others about the Indigenous food systems used by earlier

generations. They preserve local seeds to grow crops that are

originally from the area. They also teach people how to cook

traditional meals using those regional crops. Grandmother

said that Aunt Mabel has been busy planning a Community

Healing Meal event.”


“What’s a Community Healing Meal?” asked Hazel.


“A Community Healing Meal will bring local people together for

a meal made with Indigenous ingredients,” answered Hunter.

“The meal will be made to meet the community’s needs and

share our ancestral traditions. I hope I can go.”


“What a sensational idea!” exclaimed Hazel. “You are bringing

your favorite little sister too, right?”


Hunter laughed. “Sure! It can be a new tradition for us.”


“Speaking of local meals, can we stop at the market and pick

up some regional ingredients to make an after-school snack?”
