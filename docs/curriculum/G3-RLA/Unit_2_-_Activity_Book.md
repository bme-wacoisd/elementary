**Family Letter**



These family letters will come home each week. They will include spelling
words and an explanation of the Reader chapters your child will read this
week. Please help your child succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes
each evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your child
to do include: spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, or
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

For the first time this year, your child has been assigned spelling words.
This week, we are focusing on adding the suffixes _–ed_ and _–ing_ to words.
On the assessment, your child will be asked to write not only the root words
listed in the following list but also those root words with the suffixes _–ed_ and
_–ing_ added. On Friday, your child will be assessed on these words.

Students have reviewed the rules for adding _–ed_ and _–ing_ to words. When
words end with CVC (Consonant–Vowel–Consonant), the final consonant
must be doubled before adding _–ed_ or _–ing_ . The root words that are starred
in the list follow this rule. For example, the root word _hop_ becomes _hopped_
and _hopping_ . When words end with two consonants, the suffixes _–ed_ and _–_
_ing_ are simply added. There is no doubling of consonants. For example, the
root word _finish_ becomes _finished_ and _finishing_ .

Students have been assigned two Challenge Words, _give_ and _live_, to spell
this week. Challenge Words are words used very often. They may not follow
spelling patterns and need to be memorized. Students will not be responsible
for adding suffixes to the Challenge Words on the assessment.

**Student Reader**





The Reader for Unit 2 is entitled _Rattenborough’s Guide to Animals_ .
Although it is a nonfiction reader, Rattenborough, a fictional character, is the
narrator who guides students through the factual information. We are using
Rattenborough as the narrator in this Reader to make the informational text
more accessible to students. The Reader consists of selections that explain
the way in which animals are classified by scientists.

This week, students will learn about the characteristics of living things
and how scientists classify living things using these characteristics.
Characteristics that scientists use include whether animals are warm-blooded
or cold-blooded and whether they are vertebrates or invertebrates. Finally, a
chapter on fish is included.

During this unit, students will practice fluent reading by reading with
expression. Students will also have the opportunity to practice this skill at
home as well.

**Spelling**

_This week’s spelling words focus on the_ –ed _and_ –ing _endings. Students will read the_
_passage below and underline words with the_ –ed _and_ –ing _endings. Together, discuss_
_the meaning of each underlined word. Have your student read the passage aloud to_
_practice reading with expression._


**Introduction: Meet “Rattenborough”**


Greetings! Rattenborough, the famous explorer and **animal** expert here!
Remember me? I taught you all about **animals** and **habitats** when you were
just little kids in first grade. I’ve been busy since then traveling around the
world. But, I’m back now to teach you everything I’ve learned about **animals**
during my travels.


First, let’s take a quick look at what you learned in first grade. Do you
remember what a **habitat** is? A **habitat** is the place where **animals** and plants
live. We learned that there are different **ecosystems** all over the world with
different kinds of **animals** and plants living there. Ecosystems are larger
environments where organisms live and work together.

We visited a desert **ecosystem** where it was very hot and dry. It hardly
ever rains in a desert so the plants and **animals** that live there have to be able
to get by with very little water. I bet you remember that cactus plants live in
the desert, along with snakes and lizards.

We also visited an African **savanna** . A **savanna** is also called a grassland.
There were lots of interesting **animals** living there—zebras, elephants, and
even lions! To be perfectly honest, I was always a little nervous while we were
in the **savanna** !


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 2** **17**


Next, we checked out some different kinds of forests. We went to a
hardwood forest full of trees with leaves that change color and drop off in the
fall. We saw squirrels, deer, and even bears. We saw lots of different kinds of
birds in those tall trees.


Then, we visited a tropical rainforest that was very hot, humid, and wet.
There were lots of birds in this forest, too. These birds were colorful, tropical
birds like toucans and parrots.

Last, but not least, we visited freshwater and saltwater **habitats** . In the
freshwater **habitat**, we saw fish, turtles, ducks, and beavers. In the saltwater
**habitat** of the sea, we saw starfish, crabs, lobsters, and sharks!

Besides learning about **habitats** in first grade, we also studied the
different kinds of things that **animals** eat. Do you remember talking about
**herbivores**, **carnivores**, and **omnivores** ? We learned that you can sort
animals by what they eat.


So, get ready because we are going to learn a lot more about how to sort
**animals** . Rattenborough, your personal **animal** expert, at your service!


See you next time!

**Author’s Purpose**


In the 1700s, doctor and botanist Carolus Linnaeus made a big leap for
science. He set up a naming and classification system for plants and animals.
He grouped organisms with similar features into categories. He depended
mainly on human observation to do this. He did not have the knowledge
or tools we have now. Today, one goal of classification is to determine how
organisms are related. This is more complicated than just sorting organisms
based on physical traits. Just because two organisms share similar traits does
not mean they should be placed in the same group. For example, whales
and manatees are both mammals which use flippers to move around in
the ocean, but they are not as closely related as you might think. Whales
are more closely related to deer and manatees are more closely related to
elephants! With technology, scientists can now use biological techniques to
discover information about relationships. As science continues to advance,
new information is learned allowing us to update the way we classify all the
world's animals.

|Reading:<br>“Vertebrates or Invertebrates?”|Read-aloud:<br>“Vertebrate Animals”|
|---|---|
|Many other animals also are<br>vertebrates. All mammals, reptiles,<br>fish, and birds have a backbone, so<br>they are all vertebrates. They have<br>some type of spinal cord, too.<br>Animals with a backbone come in<br>all different shapes and sizes. Apes,<br>rhinos, horses, rabbits, bats, and,<br>yes, rats and humans, too are all<br>mammals and vertebrates. Lizards,<br>turtles, snakes, and crocodiles are<br>reptiles and vertebrates. Huge sharks<br>and tiny goldfish are vertebrates.<br>Small hummingbirds and large<br>eagles are vertebrates, too.|For today, let’s take a glimpse at the<br>backbones of the five animal species<br>to which my five friends belong.<br>We’ve seen that a hippopotamus has<br>a backbone. Next, let’s take a look<br>at one of Ebenezer’s fellow egrets.<br>Its backbone, or spinal column,<br>helps it to hold its head up high<br>and protects its spinal cord. Like<br>all egrets, Ebenezer could not live<br>without his backbone. All birds have<br>backbones, or vertebrae.<br>Snakes don’t look like they have<br>backbones, do they? Even though<br>snakes slither—or slip and slide<br>along—they absolutely do have<br>backbones! A snake’s vertebrae, like<br>Anna Anaconda’s, run the length<br>of its body and swing low to the<br>ground as its muscles help it move<br>along the ground or climb up trees.<br>All reptiles have backbones. So, you<br>can’t always tell from the outside<br>whether an animal is a vertebrate<br>with a spine (backbone), or whether<br>it’s an invertebrate.|



Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 2** **31**


|Reading:<br>“Vertebrates or Invertebrates?”|Read-aloud:<br>“Vertebrate Animals”|
|---|---|
||How about fish? Would you say<br>fish have a backbone? The answer<br>is yes! All fish have backbones, too,<br>just as reptiles, birds, and mammals<br>do. It’s very tricky to see, but if you<br>took an x-ray of its body, you would<br>see that all the other tiny bones that<br>make up the skeleton of the fish are<br>connected to its spine. Paolo told<br>me that even though all fish have<br>backbones, some fish—like sharks<br>and stingrays—have backbones<br>that are made of lighter and more<br>bendable cartilage instead of hard<br>bone, allowing them to be more<br>flexible and travel more quickly.<br>That leaves amphibians. Take a look<br>at my animal friends one more time;<br>pay close attention to the toad next<br>to Tabitha. It’s hard to tell when you<br>look at a toad’s body that there is a<br>backbone inside! Now tell me—do<br>toads have backbones? Yes, to be<br>sure, they certainly do! Toads are<br>vertebrates, too! All amphibians<br>have backbones! That means that<br>all five of the animals you’ve seen<br>today are vertebrates. They all have<br>backbones.|

|But there are many more animals<br>that do not have a backbone.<br>Animals without backbones are<br>called invertebrates. Insects are<br>the largest group in the animal<br>kingdom. Insects are also the<br>largest invertebrates. Insects include<br>flies, wasps, beetles, cockroaches,<br>ladybugs, and butterflies. Other<br>kinds of invertebrates include<br>earthworms and spiders.|Think how many insects there<br>must be on our planet! They make<br>up three quarters of all the species<br>in the animal kingdom! Can you<br>name a few of the many animals<br>in the insect group? Flies, wasps,<br>beetles, cockroaches, ladybugs, and<br>butterflies are all insects. There<br>are surely a lot more species of<br>insects than there are species of<br>amphibians, mammals, birds, fish,<br>and reptiles all put together!<br>Even though insects are by far the<br>largest group of invertebrates, they<br>are not the only invertebrates. Here’s<br>another question for you to think<br>about. Close your eyes and pretend<br>you are a taxonomist for a moment.<br>Can you think of any other animals<br>without backbones? Here’s a hint:<br>instead of internal vertebrae, these<br>animals have an external, or outer,<br>hard body covering.|

||The largest group of invertebrates<br>is made up of arthropods. Insects<br>make up the largest group of<br>arthropods. Another large group<br>of arthropods includes arachnids.<br>Spiders are arachnids, and so are<br>ticks, daddy longlegs, and scorpions.<br>Insects have six legs and three<br>body parts. The ant has very long<br>antennae—they almost look like<br>legs! In comparison, arachnids<br>have eight legs and two body parts.<br>Instead of having flexible internal<br>skeletons, all of the arthropods wear<br>a tough exoskeleton, or protective<br>covering, on the outside. I bet<br>you can recognize some of these<br>common examples of insects and<br>arachnids.|

_Read the following passage aloud to practice reading fluently with expression._

**Warm-Blooded and Cold-Blooded Animals**


Rattenborough here again! In the last chapter, you learned how scientists
classify living things into groups called kingdoms. You learned about the
animal and plant kingdoms. You also learned that animals and other living
things are classified into more specific groups.

Today, you will learn more about the animal kingdom. You will learn that
there are many kinds of animals that have different characteristics. Scientists
study these different characteristics to divide the animal kingdom into more
specific groups.

Many animals—such as cats, mice, rats, cows, elephants, tigers, and even
people—belong to a group called **mammals** . So, you and I are **mammals** ! All
**mammals** have hair, but some have more hair, or fur, than others. You have
to get pretty close to an elephant to see its hair, but it is a **mammal** .

Another characteristic of **mammals** is that they give birth to live babies.
**Mammal** babies begin breathing, moving, and looking for food as soon as
they are born. **Mammal** mothers make milk to feed their newborns. This is
another key characteristic of all **mammals** .

Do you think this **crocodile** is a **mammal** ?

Answer: No!

Why not?

   - **Crocodiles** have **scales**, not hair or fur.

   - **Crocodiles** lay eggs and baby crocodiles hatch from those eggs.

  - A baby **crocodile** does not get milk from its mother. Its first meal

Grade 3 might be a bug. Later, it will eat bigger animals. Activity Book **| Unit 2** **49**


**Crocodiles** belong to a different group of animals called **reptiles**, along
with snakes, lizards, and turtles.

Scientists also classify animals as **mammals** or **reptiles** based on how the
animals control their body temperature. All animals need to keep a **constant**
**temperature** inside their bodies for their bodies to work properly. If an
animal gets too hot or too cold, its body will not work the way it should. An
animal may become sick or even die.

**Mammals** are **warm-blooded** animals. When **warm-blooded** animals
are in a cold place, they use energy from food they eat to help keep their
bodies warm. Some **warm-blooded** animals shiver to keep warm. When
animals shiver, the process releases heat to keep their bodies warm.

When **warm-blooded** animals are somewhere hot, their bodies react in
a different way to cool off. Some **warm-blooded** animals, like people, sweat
to stay cool. Dogs pant to stay cool. Other **warm-blooded** animals drink lots
of water as a way to cool off. Did you know that cows need to drink almost a
bathtub full of water a day?

**Warm-blooded** animals act in different ways to maintain a **constant**
**temperature** inside their bodies. **Mammals** can live in habitats with different
**temperatures** because their bodies do not rely on the environment. **Warm-**
**blooded** animals, like **mammals**, must eat often to get energy to heat or cool
their bodies. Most **warm-blooded** animals need to eat every day. Some need
to eat every hour!

**Reptiles** are **cold-blooded** animals. The body temperature of **cold-**
**blooded** animals changes depending on the outside **temperature** . They
become hot when it is hot outside and cold when it is cold outside. But **cold-**
**blooded** animals must also keep a **constant temperature** for their bodies to
work properly.

continued



**Cold-blooded** animals do not use energy from their bodies to stay warm
or cool. Instead they use what is around them to keep warm or keep cool.
**Crocodiles** stay in water or mud in order to stay cool on hot days. If they
need to warm up on cooler days, they bask in the sun.

While **warm-blooded** animals can live in just about any habitat, **cold-**
**blooded** animals can only live in certain habitats.

**Cold-blooded** animals do not need to eat as often as **warm-blooded**
animals. This is because they do not need lots of food to make energy to
warm or cool their bodies. Most **crocodiles** only eat once a week, but they
can survive for months and sometimes years without eating!

**Take-Home Letter**



Please help your child succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your child to
do include: spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, or
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

This week, we are focusing again on adding the suffixes _–ed_ and _–ing_ to
words. On the assessment, your child will be asked to write not only the root
words listed below but also those root words with the suffixes _–ed_ and _–ing_
added. The spelling words this week end with the letter ‘e’. When the suffixes
_–ed_ and _–ing_ are added to these words, it is first necessary to drop the final
letter ‘e’ before adding the suffix. For example, the root word _smile_ becomes
_smiled_ and _smiling_ . Your child will be assessed on these words.

Students have been assigned two Challenge Words, _does_ and _done_ .
Challenge Words are words used very often. They may not follow spelling
patterns and need to be memorized. Students will not be responsible for
adding suffixes to the Challenge Words.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 2** **73**


The spelling words, including the Challenge Words, are listed below:



|1. smile|7. file|
|---|---|
|2. vote|8. dine|
|3. rake|9. quote|
|4. translate|10. raise|
|5. prepare|**Challenge Word**: _does_|

_Read the following passage aloud to practice reading fluently with expression._

**Reptiles**


Hi again, it’s Rattenborough! You have already learned a little about
today’s group of animals, which are reptiles. You already know that reptiles
are cold-blooded animals and vertebrates. But did you know that reptiles
live both on land and in water like amphibians? Reptiles have lungs from the
time they are born, not gills, like amphibians.


You may also already know that reptiles lay eggs. Some reptile eggs
have soft shells and some have hard shells. They lay their eggs on land. A
few snakes hold the eggs inside their bodies until they hatch. Very few rare
reptiles do give birth to live young, never making real eggs.


Many different groups of animals are classified as reptiles. These include
animals such as crocodiles, alligators, turtles, tortoises, snakes, and lizards.


Some people may think reptiles, mainly snakes, are scary. Most reptiles
will not harm people. But there are some reptiles that you should try to
avoid. The black mamba is the best example. This is the longest and most
**venomous** snake in Africa. It is also the **deadliest** snake in the world. A
mamba **injects** **venom** whenever it bites something. A mamba bite can kill
any animal—even a human—in less than 20 minutes!

Rattlesnakes, copperheads, and **water moccasins** are types of **venomous**
snakes found in the United States. Rattlesnakes, or rattlers, are easy to spot
because they have “rattles” that shake on their tails. You know when there is
one nearby because you can hear the rattles shaking.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 2** **95**


Copperheads have a triangle-shaped head and dark stripes. They are
normally less than three feet long. They prefer to live in rocky, wooded areas.
They only bite humans if they are attacked or **startled** .

**Water moccasins** live in the water so they are hard to spot. They have a
dangerous bite, but rarely attack humans. If you live in a southern state like
Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, or Louisiana, you are more likely to see one.
They live in swamps or shallow lakes. You might want to avoid swimming in
shallow waters if you live in those states.


Some people think snakes are slimy because their skin looks shiny, but
most reptiles have thick, dry, scaly skin. Reptiles are known for **molting**, or
shedding their skin. Reptiles shed their skin several times during their lives.
Snakes, for example, shed their skin in one big piece. They do this when they
grow too big for their current skin.


The biggest reptile is the saltwater crocodile, which lives mainly in
Australia and a few parts of India and Asia. Male saltwater crocodiles can
grow to be 20 feet long or more! Attacks on humans are rare.


Crocodiles have the most powerful bite in the entire animal kingdom.

Their bites are ten times stronger than that of a great white shark. Despite
their power when they bite and snap their jaws shut, it is fairly easy to
hold a crocodile’s mouth closed. They open their mouths using a weak set
of muscles.

Please help your child succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your child to
do include: spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, or
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

This week, we are focusing on adding the suffix _–es_ to words. On the
assessment, your child will be asked to write not only the root words listed
below but also those root words with the suffix _–es_ added. Students have
reviewed the rule that when a word ends with the letter ‘y’, it is necessary to
change the ‘y’ to ‘i’ before adding the suffix _–es_ . For example, the root word
_puppy_ becomes _puppies_ . Your child will be assessed on these words.

Students have been assigned two Challenge Words, _along_ and _put_ .
Challenge Words are words used very often. They may not follow spelling
patterns and need to be memorized. Students will not be responsible for
adding suffixes to the Challenge Words. Students will not be responsible for
adding the suffix _–es_ to the Challenge Words.

The spelling words, including the Challenge Words, are listed below:

**Family Letter**



Over the past couple of weeks, your child has been learning more about
the classification of animals. S/he has learned about each of the five groups
of vertebrate animals: fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Your
child has listened to several colorful and informative read-aloud stories.
For each animal group, your child has learned whether it is cold-blooded
or warm-blooded, whether it is a vertebrate or an invertebrate, and other
important characteristics.

Below are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to
reinforce what your child is learning about the classification of animals.

**1. Classify the Animal**

Look through magazines or books that have pictures/illustrations of
animals. Talk to your child about the things s/he notices about each animal,
like whether it has a backbone (vertebrate) or no backbone (invertebrate), its
body covering (fur or hair, scales, feathers), and whether it is cold-blooded
or warm-blooded. Your child may want to create a collage of pictures of
animals that belong to one of the vertebrate groups.

**2. Animal Groups Drawing**

Have your child draw a picture of one of the groups of animals (fish,
amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) s/he has learned about, with
several examples of the kinds of animals included in the group. Talk with
your child about one of these animals, how scientists classify this animal, and
any other interesting facts.

**3. Sayings and Phrases: The Show Must Go On**

Discuss with your child what the saying “the show must go on” means. It
was in use in the United States starting in about 1867, and likely originated
with the popularity of the circus. Despite tragic accidents, poor weather


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 2** **133**


conditions, and other setbacks which might have meant cancellation,
circus shows usually took place as scheduled. To prevent profits from being
drastically reduced and to keep morale up amongst circus workers, many
circus managers operated in this way. Think of a time when your child
needed to continue on with something that needed to be completed, even
though there were setbacks.

**4. Words to Use**

Below are several words that your child will be learning about and using.
Try to use these words as they come up in everyday speech with your child.


   - _aquatic_ —Fish and other aquatic animals can be found in the lake
south of town.

   - _nest_ —My grandmother spotted a robin’s nest with four, small, blue
eggs in it.

   - _venomous_ —When visiting a new ecosystem, it is a good idea to learn
what kinds of venomous animals live there.

   - _lungs_ —My lungs help me to breathe air, but my pet goldfish must use
its gills to get the oxygen it needs from water.

   - _terrestrial_ —Some of the larger terrestrial animals at the zoo, such as
elephants and bears, need a lot of land in which to move around
and exercise.


**5. Read Aloud Each Day**

It is very important that you read to your child each day. Set aside time to
read to your child and also to listen to your child read to you.

Be sure to praise your child whenever s/he shares what has been learned
at school.

Beavers are mammals that have an important role in nature. Beavers have
two key characteristics: long, sharp teeth and a flat, wide tail. They use their
teeth to **gnaw** down trees of all sizes for food and for building things. They
use their tails to swim, but that’s not all! If a beaver smells or sees danger
nearby, it will warn the other beavers. It slaps its tail on the water surface as a
loud warning.


Beavers live in ponds and lakes in some parts of North America and in
some parts of Europe and Asia. They are pretty hard to find today because
they were nearly hunted to **extinction** . Beavers were prized for their **pelts**,
which people used to make fur coats and hats.

They are still hunted today, not only for their **pelts** but also because
many people think they are pests. As you will learn, beavers can play a very
important role in nature by creating a special habitat called a **wetland** . But
sometimes they are pests because they disturb places where people live.

Beavers are the second largest **rodent** in the world. They do look a bit
like their fellow **rodents**, such as mice, rats, and hamsters.


Have you ever heard the expression “busy as a beaver”? It comes from the
fact that, in the wild, beavers never seem to stop working.


They spend much of their time in water. They are best known for
building dams in rivers and streams. They build dams in order to create
deeper bodies of water. They move slowly on land, but they are great
swimmers. Deep water protects them from bears and other predators.
They dive underwater when they sense danger. They can hold their breath
underwater for up to 15 minutes.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 2** **149**


Beavers also build places to live called lodges. Lodges are big piles of
sticks and mud that they build after they have built a nice dam. After the
beavers **gnaw** down trees, they strip off and eat the bark of the tree. They use
the rest of the tree to build their lodges and dams.


A single beaver family can really change its surroundings. Beavers’ dams
can cause the water in the stream or river to rise up, flooding the nearby
land. This creates a swamp, or **wetland** . **Wetlands** are important ecosystems
for many types of birds, mammals, fish, and insects. But if there are people
living nearby, they may not welcome the flooding!


Beavers don’t stay in one place for very long. Once the good bark from
all the trees is eaten in one place, they tend to move downstream and start all
over again. But the **wetland** they made often remains long after they leave.

Beavers are very **territorial** : they often attack other beavers that try to
move into a space that they have claimed. They want to keep all the tasty tree
bark for themselves.


All in all, beavers are interesting mammals to watch and study.

Birds can be found nearly everywhere on Earth, and they come in
many different sizes and colors. They also live in many different types of
ecosystems. This affects how they eat, nest, and sing songs. Hummingbirds
are among the smallest birds. The bee hummingbird is the smallest bird on
Earth at just two inches long and weighing less than a penny!


A hummingbird is an amazing little animal. It can flap its wings up to 90
times in 1 second! That’s so fast that it looks like its wings are a blur. It’s hard
to see its wings because they are constantly flapping.


Hummingbirds dart around from flower to flower, like bees. They use
their long, pointy beaks to drink sweet nectar from flowers. Since they are
so busy flapping their wings, they need to eat a lot to replace all of their
energy. A typical hummingbird will visit hundreds of flowers every day,
drinking more than its own weight in nectar. Nectar has sugar, which
gives hummingbirds plenty of energy. As they find insects on flowers,
hummingbirds eat them up.


Hummingbirds are attracted to red flowers. They are also drawn to red
feeders, which people hang on porches and trees. The feeders are filled with
sugary water, which is then dyed red to attract the birds. People hang feeders
for them because these birds are a lot of fun to watch!


Like many birds, the ruby-throated hummingbird migrates. This
means it spends part of the year in one place and part of the year in another
place. It can be found in parts of the eastern United States during the late
spring and early summer. When autumn rolls around, it heads south for
warmer weather.


Here is an amazing fact: this tiny bird, which is shorter than your finger,
doesn’t migrate just a few miles. It migrates all the way across the Gulf of

Mexico—500 miles—without stopping! From there, it may continue south
through Mexico to Costa Rica and beyond.


Here is another interesting fact: they are the only birds that can fly
backwards! They can also **hover**, or float in the air, and fly upside down.


Their nests are very small, about half as big as a walnut shell. They make
their nests using leaves and small yellow and green plants called **moss** . They
use spider webs to hold these little bits of nature together. They sometimes
eat the spider before using its web as glue.

The spider web is nice and sticky, and it is also **flexible** . A hummingbird
will lay two tiny eggs. When its tiny eggs hatch and the babies begin to grow,
the spider web will allow the nest to expand. This helps the babies stay warm
and safe. In the photo, a hummingbird is feeding its babies. Maybe it is giving
them a nice juicy bug to eat or sharing a taste of sweet flower nectar.


See if you can find a more interesting little bird than that!

**Piranhas**


Piranhas are meat-eating fish with razor-sharp teeth. If an animal 12

goes into a pond where these fish are, the piranhas may attack. A 25

large school of hungry piranhas can kill a large animal very quickly. 37


Piranhas live in South America. They are found in the Amazon 48

River and in other rivers and lakes. 55


Like most fish, piranhas lay eggs. The female lays up to five 67

thousand eggs at one time. The male piranha guards the eggs until 79

they hatch. However, after they hatch, the baby piranhas are on 90

their own. 92


A typical piranha is five to ten inches long. It might weigh 104

two pounds. 106


A piranha has a single row of teeth. These teeth are shaped like 119

triangles and are very sharp. In fact, they are so sharp that in the past, 134

some native people used them to make weapons and tools. 144


Piranhas have very strong jaws. Pound for pound, they are 154

stronger biters than great white sharks! 160


Here is how scientists measure bite strength. First, they weigh the 171

animal. Next, they allow the animal to bite a special tool that measures 184

how strong its bite is. Finally, they divide the bite strength by the 197

animal size. 199


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 2** **163**


A great white shark has a bite force about equal to its body. It 213

might weigh five thousand pounds and it might bite with a force of 226

about five thousand pounds. A piranha is much smaller. It might 237

weigh two pounds. But it can bite with sixty pounds of force. Sixty 250

divided by two is thirty. That means the piranha’s bite strength is 262

about thirty times as strong as a great white shark. 272


A piranha’s bite hurts a lot, but what makes it even worse is what 286

comes next. Once the piranha has bitten down, it spins away from its 299

prey, tearing out a chunk of flesh. Ouch! 307


Piranhas have been known to attack humans. But such attacks are 318

not common. There are some scary movies that make it sound like 330

piranhas are always attacking people. We know now that this is just 342

not true. 344
