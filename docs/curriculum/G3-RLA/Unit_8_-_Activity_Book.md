**Family Letter**

**Dear Family Members,**

Please help your student succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words with them. Helpful activities for your student to
do include spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, and
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

This week we are reviewing the spelling patterns we’ve learned for /ue/ (spelled
u, u_e, and ue).

Students have been assigned two Challenge Words, _impossible_ and _journal_ .
Challenge Words are words used very often. The Challenge Words do not
follow the spelling patterns for this week and need to be memorized.

The Content Word for this week is _explorer_ . This word is directly related
to the material that we are reading in _The Age of Exploration_ . The Content
Word is an optional spelling word for your student. If your student would
like to try it, but gets it incorrect, it will not count against them on the
assessment. We encourage students to stretch themselves a bit and try to
spell this word.

**Challenge Word** : _impossible_

**Challenge Word** : _journal_

**Content Word** : _explorer_



The chapters your student will read in _The Age of Exploration_ include
information about explorers from Europe. These selections are historical
accounts of the difficulties explorers faced, what they were in search of,
their destinations, their discoveries, and the impact they had on Native
Americans. This week students will read about the quest for spices and gold,
about navigational tools, and about a settlement built by the Spaniards. Be
sure to ask your student each evening about what they are learning.

Below are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to
highlight what your student is learning about the European explorers of
North America.

**1. The Transatlantic Journey: Geography**

On a world map or globe, have your student locate Asia, Europe, North
America, and the Atlantic Ocean. Once your student shows they can identify
these larger geographic areas, ask your student to locate Spain, Italy, and
England in Europe; India in Asia; and the Bahamas and other islands in the
Caribbean Sea. Ask your student who Christopher Columbus was, in which
country he was born, and who funded his expedition. Ask why Christopher

Columbus thought he would find the East Indies if he sailed west across the
Atlantic Ocean. Ask your student what motivated kings and queens to
sponsor transatlantic voyages, and what motivated explorers to make
uncharted journeys to the Americas, or what explorers called the
“New World.”

**2. Discussion Topics**

Ask your student, “If you were an explorer, where in the world would
you want to explore?” Have your student pick a place on the globe. Ask
your student to envision what life must have been like there five hundred
years ago, without electricity, indoor plumbing, central heating or cooling,
advanced medical care, air travel, etc. Ask the following questions: “How
would you prepare for the journey? What would you have to bring? How
would you get to your destination? What kinds of jobs would people
accompanying you on the journey have to be able to do to make the journey
possible?” Ask your student how they would feel about arriving in an
unfamiliar land with a foreign landscape, seeing unfamiliar people who
look different from those in their culture, and who speak an unfamiliar
language. Ask, “How would you survive in the new land? How would you
communicate with the inhabitants? How would you figure out where to go
in an uncharted land? How would you feed yourself? Would you stay and
make a new home, or try to find a way back where you came from?” Now
ask your student to imagine that they were experiencing explorers arriving
on the land where they lived. Ask, “What would you think? How would you
feel? How would you respond?”

**3. Words to Use**

Below is a list of some of the words that your student will be learning about
and using. Try to use these words in everyday speech with your student if
possible. Otherwise make up sentences that use these words.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 8** **11**


   - _propose_ —I propose we order out for dinner tonight instead of cooking.


   - _conquistadors_ —The Spanish conquistadors were more interested in
finding gold in the Americas than they were in the possibility of creating
settlements.


   - _colonization_ —The British colonization of North America resulted in the
original thirteen colonies.


   - _disastrous_ —A disastrous fire swept through the library.


   - _investigative_ —The scientist’s investigative research helped solve the
mystery behind the existence of microscopic organisms called bacteria.


**4. Read Aloud Each Day**

It is very important that you read with your student every day. Set aside
time to read to your student and to listen to your student read to you.

Be sure to praise your student whenever they share what has been learned
at school.

**Navigation in the Age of Exploration**


Do you ever go on trips with your family? How do the adults in your
family find the places they want to visit? Do they write down directions?
Do they use maps? Do they look for **landmarks** along the way? Do they
have an electronic **device** that tells them where to turn?


Early European explorers didn’t have most of those things. Most sailors
in those days stayed close to land and looked for familiar **landmarks** .
However, this would not work for explorers. They could not look for
familiar **landmarks** because they were sailing into unknown waters.

Early explorers did have some maps but they were not always **accurate** .
So how did the explorers **keep track** of where they were?


They had several tools that they might have used. One of them was a
**compass** . A **compass** is a very simple **device** . It is just a little **magnet** that sits
on a pin so it can spin. The pointer on the **magnet** points north. Back then,
nobody knew why. Now, we know it’s because Earth has a **magnetic field**,
which is strongest at the poles. **Magnets** are attracted to the **magnetic field** of
the North Pole.

Using a **compass**, an explorer could figure out which direction was north.
Plus, if he knew which direction was north, he could figure out south, east,
and west. That was a big help.

Explorers also used the stars to **keep track** of their position. Sailors in this
day used two **gadgets** . One was called a **quadrant** . The other one was called
an **astrolabe** . The details of how these **gadgets** work are complicated but the
basic idea is not. The idea is that you can **keep track** of your position on Earth


by **keeping track** of where certain stars appear to be in the night sky. If you can
tell where the sun, the North Star and other key stars are, you should be able to
figure out where you are on Earth.

Others may have **kept track** of how far they had traveled using a **method**
called **dead reckoning** .

Here’s how **dead reckoning** worked: a sailor had a piece of wood that was
tied to a rope. The rope was knotted at regular intervals. There might be a
knot every five feet. The sailor would toss the piece of wood overboard while
the ship was sailing. When the wood hit the water, the sailor would turn over
an **hourglass** .


The sailor or the captain of the ship would then watch to see how much
rope was pulled out of the ship and into the sea. If the ship was going fast,
it would quickly leave the piece of wood behind. It would pull many yards of
rope out of the ship before the **hourglass** ran out. If the ship was going slower,
it would not pull as much rope out. Then, the person would count how many
knots of rope got pulled out of the ship before the **hourglass** emptied out.
If you have ever heard of a ship’s speed referred to as knots, this is a **forerunner**
of that measurement of speed.

A ship’s captain could use **dead reckoning** to make an **estimate** of how fast
the ship was moving. Then, he could **estimate** how far the ship would travel in
an hour or a day. He could use a **compass** to know which way he was heading.
He could put all this together to make an **estimate** of where he was.

Our substitute teacher, Mr. Brown, was a “grammar whiz” and excitedly taught the
grammar lesson to our class. It seemed as though he loved grammar more than
any other subject. His examples were full of details and information. He called on
students to share their ideas and made everyone feel very smart. At the end of the
lesson, all of us understood what he taught us.


Our class trip to the zoo was a day to remember! We all got on the bus and took
our assigned seats. Mrs. Washington had paired us up with friends so we all chatted
happily as we rode to the zoo. Then, we arrived at the zoo and began to follow
the guide around to look at the many kinds of animals. It was so cool to see lions,
tigers, and the different kinds of birds, and many of us were taking pictures.
We must have walked for miles and miles to see all of the animals. At the end
of the day, we were all tired but full of great memories.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 8** **37**


Performing before an audience for the first time is both scary and exciting.
When I reached third grade, my parents decided I should take piano lessons,
something I had dreamed of for years. They bought a second-hand piano at a
thrift shop, had it put in my bedroom, and hired a teacher named Miss Sanders.
She and I were instant friends, and I loved each and every lesson I took from her.
After three months, it was recital time, and I was ready to play two songs I had
learned by heart. As I walked up to the piano in her studio to play my songs,
I looked at all the parents and families who had gathered to hear Miss Sanders’
students perform, and I thought I would faint. I was so afraid I would make a
mistake or forget how to play the songs. But I just took a deep breath and was
able to remember every note. When I was finished, I happily took a bow as the
audience applauded.

**El Castillo de San Marcos**


In 1565, the Spaniards **established** a settlement in St. Augustine, Florida.
While there are other, older Europeans settlements in North America, it is
the oldest **continuously occupied** European settlement in the 50 states of
the United States. You can visit there today and still see the old buildings
standing.

This **fort** was built by the Spaniards in the 1600s. It is called El Castillo de
San Marcos. That is its Spanish name. Its English name is the Castle (or **Fort** )
of Saint Mark.

El Castillo de San Marcos was not the first **fort** the Spaniards built in
St. Augustine. They built seven or eight **forts** before they built this one. But
these earlier **forts** were made of wood and were not very strong. Some of
them were **destroyed** in wars. Others were **wrecked** by hurricanes. In 1672,
the Spaniards decided to build a new **fort** . This time, they decided they
would use stone to make it strong.


Can you guess what the walls of El Castillo de San Marcos are made of?
Believe it or not, they are made of seashells! The Spaniards used a kind of
rock called **coquina** . **Coquina** is a mixture of **fossils** and seashells.
Those shells are the remains of tiny animals that lived in the sea long, long
ago. The Spaniards found **coquina** along the Florida seashore. They used it
to build the **fort** .


**Coquina** turned out to be a good stone for building **forts** . It is softer than
other rocks. That means it does not crack or **shatter** when cannonballs hit it.
A cannonball might make a dent in a **coquina** wall or it might be absorbed
into the wall. But, in most cases, it would not crack the wall.

The **fort** was surrounded by a **moat** . It is no longer filled with water. It is
now a dry **moat** .

There was only one way into the **fort** . You had to enter a mini- **fort** that
stood just in front of the main **fort** . This mini- **fort** was called the **ravelin** .

A bridge led from the **ravelin** across the **moat** and into the main **fort** .
The last part of this bridge was a drawbridge. It could be lifted up to keep
people from getting in.

It was not easy to open the drawbridge. It took five men fifteen minutes
to open it.

El Castillo de San Marcos was a strong **fortress** . It was attacked many
times but it was never captured.

**Second Sons**


Did you know that many explorers had older brothers? Very few of them
were the oldest sons in their families.


Can you guess why that might be?


It’s not because firstborn children didn’t want to go out and explore the
world. It has to do with the laws in Europe at the time. Most countries in Europe
had laws about who could **inherit** an **estate** . These laws stated that the oldest son
in a family would **inherit** all of his father’s land, goods, and money.


This was true for kings. When a king died, he would be replaced on the
**throne** by his eldest son. A daughter could only become queen if a king had
no sons.

This was also true for **nobles** . For example, if the Duke of Richland died,
his eldest son would become the new Duke of Richland. This eldest son would
**inherit** everything his father owned.


What did the younger sons and daughters get? Nothing.

This system is known as **primogeniture** . Primo means “first.” “Geniture”
means born. **Primogeniture** is a system in which the firstborn son **inherits**
everything when his father dies.


This way of doing things seems very strange to us today. It also seems unfair.
Most parents today would not leave all their money and **property** to their oldest
son. They would split the money and **property** up among all their children.
Why, then, did Europeans do things differently back in the 1400s and 1500s?


There is actually a good reason. Let’s go back to the Duke of Richland.
Imagine that he is a wealthy landowner living in a land with no law of
**primogeniture** . Let’s say he owns 1,000 acres of good farmland. But, alas, he dies.
His land is split between his two sons. So now we have two men, each of whom
has 500 acres of land. Now, suppose each of these two men has four sons. When
the fathers die, their lands are split again. So now we have eight men with 125
acres each. Do you see what is happening? The **estate** of Richland is being split
up. It is no longer big and **impressive** . It is becoming small and unimportant.
The men of Richland are probably also becoming less powerful because they
each have less land.


Also, who is the Duke of Richland now? Are all eight of his grandsons now
dukes? Will their grandsons also be dukes? At this rate, the land will be **overrun**
by dukes!

The **nobles** did not want this to happen. They wanted to keep their lands
together, so their families would remain powerful. They wanted there to be one
Duke of Richland and they wanted him to remain one of the most powerful men
in the country. That is why they passed laws of **primogeniture** .


This was good news for the oldest son in each family. It was bad news for the
other sons and for all the daughters. They had to find other ways to make money
and gain power.

One way to do this was to be an explorer. If you could not **inherit**
anything in your home empire, why not sail off and discover some other way
to make your fortune?


This is, in fact, what many second sons did in the late 1400s and 1500s.
They went in search of ways to make money they would never have **inherited**
if they stayed in Europe.

**Dear Family Members,**

Please help your student succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words with them. Helpful activities for your student
include: spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, and
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

This week we are reviewing spelling patterns we’ve learned for /oo/: _oo_, _ew_,

_o_, and _o_e_ . Your student will be assessed on these words.

Students have been assigned three Challenge Words, _country_, _through_,
and _threw_ . Challenge Words are words used very often and need to be
memorized. The Challenge Word _threw_ does follow one of the spelling
patterns for this week. Although _through_ also makes the /oo/ sound, it
contains a very rare spelling.

The Content Word for this week is _discovery_ . This word is directly related
to the material we are reading in _The Age of Exploration_ . The Content Word
is an optional spelling word for your student. If your student would like to
try it, but gets it incorrect, it will not count against them on the assessment.
We encourage students to stretch themselves a bit and try to spell this word.


The spelling words, including the Challenge Words and Content Word, are
as follows:



1. remove

2. dewdrop

3. groove

4. shrewd

5. booth

6. movement

7. balloon

The chapters your student will read this week in _The Age of Exploration_
include information about Spanish, English, and French explorers. Also,
your student will read about two reasons for exploration: to claim land for
a specific European country and to establish trade with Native Americans.
Students will also read a description of a young sailor’s life on a ship. Be sure
to ask your student each evening about what they are learning.

**Coronado Reports to the King**


Francisco Vasquez de Coronado was a Spanish conquistador. He
explored what is now the American Southwest in search of the Seven Cities
of Cibola [SEE-boe-lə], which were said to have streets paved with gold.
During the trip, Coronado wrote letters to the King of Spain. In his second
letter, written in October of 1541, he described his march across the Great
**Plains** to Quivira [Kee-VEE-rə], in modern-day Kansas. He told the king
about the Native people he and his men met. He also described the bison
they saw, which he called “cows.” On the pages that follow is an edited
version of Coronado’s letter.


Your Majesty,

After I sent my last letter, I met some Native people from a **distant** land.
They **boasted** of their land, which is called Quivira. They said the men there
lived in large houses. They said their chiefs dined on dishes made of gold. I did
not know whether to believe these reports. I made up my mind to go and see
Quivira.

We set off last spring and reached the **plains** . These **plains** were **vast**   so **vast** that we could not see the end of them. They were flat and open
with grasses that blow in the breeze. We traveled over them for more than
300 **leagues** . The **plains** were full of cows. There were too many of them to
count. There was not a single day when we did not see some of them.


After 17 days, we met some Native people. They are called Querechos

[Ker-AE-koez]. They do not plant crops. They travel around with the cows.
They eat the flesh of the cows they kill. They **tan** the skins of the cows and


make clothes from them. They have little tents made of cowhide. They live in
these tents while they travel around with the cows. They have dogs that carry
their tents and poles from place to place.


We traveled 42 days more. At times, it was hard to find the way. On the
**plains**, there are few landmarks. There are no hills. There are no stones,
trees, or shrubs. All we could see was a sea of grass.


We lived on the flesh of the cows we killed. We went many days without
water. Sometimes, what we drank was more mud than water. There are no
trees on the **plains** except by the rivers. So, we could rarely find firewood.


After 77 days, we arrived in Quivira.


This was the place our guides had described. They had told us of stone
houses that were many stories tall. But we found only little grass huts. There
were only a few people in the place and they were as **barbarous** as the others
we have met. They swore to obey Your Majesty and placed themselves under
your **royal lordship** .

The Natives gave me a piece of **copper** . I have sent this back to the
**viceroy** of New Spain. I have not seen any other metal in these parts except
this and some little **copper** bells.


We stayed in Quivira for 25 days. I searched the nearby lands to see if
there is anything which could be of service to Your Majesty. Besides the land
itself and people who live on it, I have not found or heard of anything. I am
sure there is no gold here.

The land in Quivira is the best I have seen for producing crops. The soil is
black. The land is well-watered by springs and rivers. I found some **prunes** like
those in Spain. There are some nuts. There are also very good sweet grapes and
**mulberries** .


I have treated the Natives as well as was possible, as Your Majesty
commanded. They have received no harm in any way from me or from those
who went in my company.


This is my report. I have done all that I possibly could to serve Your
Majesty. I remain Your Majesty’s **humble** servant and **vassal**,

**Family Letter**

**Dear Family Members,**

We hope your student is enjoying learning about the European explorers
of North America. We are now embarking on the second half of this unit.
In these lessons, students will learn about the Spanish settlements in North
America, including the first continuously inhabited European settlement of
St. Augustine in present-day Florida. Your student also will learn about the
expeditions of John Cabot, Henry Hudson, and Samuel de Champlain.

Below are some suggestions for activities that you may do at home to
underscore what your student is learning about European explorers of
North America.

**1. Discussion and Geography**

Ask your student to tell you what they have learned so far about the
Spanish settlements in North America. Ask your student to describe how the
objectives of the explorers changed over time from conquest to settlement.
Ask your student to explain the differences between what conquistadors
wanted versus what the later missionaries wanted in the Americas. (In
the beginning, the Spanish conquistadors were looking for riches. The
missionaries wanted to share Christianity with the Native Americans and
secure the land and people for the Spanish empire.) Ask your student to
locate on a map the present-day states where these Spanish settlements were.
Guide your student in locating the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, New
Mexico, and California on a map.


**2. Explorers**

Over the next several days, ask your student to tell you what they know
about the explorers John Cabot, Henry Hudson, and Samuel de Champlain.
Ask her or him what countries they were from and which countries funded
their expeditions. Ask your student to identify the areas of North America
that these men explored on a world map or globe. Have your student
describe the explorations of these Europeans.

**3. Compass and Directions Activity**

Go outside with your student, taking along a compass. Relative to your
home, identify the directions of east, west, north, and south. Have your
student draw an aerial view of your home and its surroundings and indicate
these directions on their sketch. Remind students that they learned a
mnemonic device to remember the cardinal directions: “Never Eat Soggy
Waffles.” (Start at the top of the map and label it ‘N’ for north; then proceed
clockwise to place the other cardinal directions on the map.) Think about
the states that border Texas. Ask your student in which direction they would
have to go to get to those various states. Now ask about the countries of
Canada and Mexico: which way would they have to travel to get to those
countries? In which direction would they travel to get to the Atlantic Ocean
or Pacific Ocean?

**4. Sayings and Phrases: Touch and Go**

Discuss with your student what the saying “touch and go” means.
The saying “touch and go” refers to a dangerous situation or precarious
condition. The saying comes from a nineteenth-century British nautical
term used to describe a ship that has almost run aground. If the ship
touches bottom without getting stuck, it is able to float clear or go again.
Think of a recent “near miss” you or your student experienced, and how
this saying can be used to describe that incident.

TAKE-HOME



Below is a list of some of the words that your student will be learning about
and using. Try to use these words as they come up in everyday speech with
your student.


   - _achievements_ —The Noble Peace Prize winner’s many achievements
were celebrated at the last award ceremony.


   - _navigational_ —The compass is a navigational tool because it always
points north and helps you know where you are and where to go.


   - _unfamiliar_ —When Dorothy came out of her tornado-damaged house
and saw the unfamiliar world of Munchkin Land, she knew she wasn’t
in Kansas anymore.


   - _envisioned_ —Christopher Columbus envisioned a much smaller world
than what he encountered in reality.


**6. Read Aloud Each Day**

It is very important that you read with your student every day. Set aside
time to read to your student and to listen to your student read to you.

Be sure to praise your student whenever they share what has been learned
at school.

**John Cabot**


John Cabot (known as Giovanni Caboto [JEE-oe-VO-nee CA-bu-toe] in
his native Italy) had the same dream as Columbus: to reach Asia by sailing west.
However, unlike Columbus, Cabot thought the best chance of reaching Asia
would be to sail around the northern part of Earth, where the distance around
would be **substantially** shorter than the distance at the **equator** . Cabot, like
other explorers, wanted to find the Northwest Passage, which was thought to be
a shorter route west from Europe to Asia. Finding a shorter route to Asia meant
finding a shorter route to spices.


Many details of Cabot’s life and voyages are unknown. He did not keep
records during his voyages nor was much written about his life. However, it is
known that he was Italian and had support from King Henry VII of England
for his voyages. King Henry VII gave Cabot a **charter** to explore and **claim**
land for England.

Cabot made his first **attempt** to find the Northwest Passage in 1496. This
**attempt** was a failure. He had a disagreement with some members of his crew.
There was also a **shortage** of food and he ran into bad weather. Cabot decided to
turn back for England.


Cabot tried again in 1497, with a single ship and a crew of 18. This time,
he reached land, which he thought was Asia. However, this land turned out to
be the coast of North America. It is not known exactly where he first sighted
land, though. It may have been the coast of Newfoundland. Cabot spent a short
time exploring the coast and it is possible that he sailed as far south as the
Chesapeake Bay. During this voyage, Cabot found a large area of **shallow** water


that was abundant with fish. This area, known as the Grand Banks, is still one
of the best fishing areas in the world today. At any rate, Cabot and his men
became one of the first European **expeditions** to see the **landmass** now known
as North America.


Cabot sailed back to England with his news. Certain that he had found
a new, shorter route to Asia, Cabot gained support for another, much larger
**expedition** . This **expedition** left England in 1498, but it never returned. Nobody
knows for certain what happened to Cabot and his men. In time, it became clear
that Cabot had not, in fact, located the Northwest Passage. However, England
based its later **claims** to North American **territory** on Cabot’s explorations.
When Cabot had first sighted land, he had gone **ashore** and **claimed** it for
England. Cabot’s exploration began England’s desire to explore and create
settlements in North America.


Do you think you could be a sailor on Cabot’s ship? Here is a description of
what it might be like to be a young sailor.

On a ship, young boys served as **pages** . On land, a **page** worked for a knight.
At sea, he worked for a captain. **Pages** did all sorts of odd jobs. They carried
messages, mopped the deck, helped pass out food, and cleaned up after meals.

Older boys might be asked to work the **bilge pumps** . Even the best ships
sometimes sprang a leak. If a ship leaked too much, it might sink. To keep that
from happening, sailors had to pump water out of the ship using a **bilge pump** .
This was a terrible job. The bilge water was disgusting. It smelled bad and it
made the sailors sick.


After pumping bilge water all day, it would have been great to sit down to a
nice, warm meal. Unfortunately, sailors did not get many warm meals. For most
meals, they got **hardtack** .

TAKE-HOME



**Hardtack** was a kind of bread that was baked over and over. **Hardtack** was
so hard, it was tough to eat. Sailors had to soak it in a drink to soften it up. The
good thing about **hardtack**, though, was that it would not **spoil** on a long voyage.
It was so hard, bugs had trouble getting into it—unless it got wet. Once it got wet,
**weevils** and other bugs could and did get into it. But you could usually see them
and brush them off with your fingers.


If a voyage was going well, sailors might get other kinds of food. They might
get a little salted meat now and then. They might get some fish or a few beans.
But if supplies were running low, they might get nothing but **hardtack** .


The diet on sailing ships was so bad that many sailors got sick. Lots of them
got a disease called **scurvy** . Today, we know that **scurvy** is caused by a lack
of vitamin C, found in fresh fruits and vegetables. In the Age of Exploration,
people did not know this. So many sailors died.


After a long day of work, sailors were ready to fall into bed and rest their
aching bones. They were ready—but there were no beds for them to fall into. The
captain had a bed to sleep in, but the sailors did not. They slept on the deck. As
the ship rolled back and forth with the waves, the sailors rolled with it.

Most sailors had to stand **watch** for part of the night. When that was done,
they could sleep for a few hours. In the morning, they would get up and do it all
over again. A sailor’s day started bright and early.


So, what do you think? Does a sailor’s life sound good to you?

**Henry Hudson**


An Englishman named Henry Hudson tried four times to find the
Northwest Passage. He died trying.


First, in 1607, he tried sailing north from England. If you look at a globe,
you can see what he was trying to do. He understood that Earth was round
and he thought he could sail across the North Pole. He didn’t understand
that **solid** ice always covers the Arctic Ocean. “I hoped to have a clear sea,”
Hudson wrote of his first journey, but “that proved impossible due to the ice
surrounding us.”

Hudson tried again in 1608. He sailed northeast and again found **icebergs**
and freezing weather. He turned his boat around and tried sailing northwest.
When his crew realized that they weren’t heading home, they **rebelled** against
Hudson, saying they wouldn’t work unless they sailed to England. So, home
they went.


In 1609, Henry Hudson sailed west. This time, he was working for a
group of businessmen called the Dutch East India Company. On this trip,
he reached North America and claimed land for Holland.


Hudson saw many Native people. One man who sailed with him wrote
in his journal, “They are well-dressed in loose deer skins and brought green
tobacco which they gave us in exchange for knives and beads.” The Native
people also gave the sailors bread made of **maize** .


Hudson sailed past “a very good piece of ground and a cliff close by of whitegreen color…on the side of the river called Manna-hata.” It was the island we
now call Manhattan (the center of New York City today). Next, Hudson sailed


up a river that still bears his name. You’ll find the Hudson River on a map of the
state of New York.


In 1610, Hudson tried once more to find a shortcut from Europe to
Asia. He sailed a ship called _Discovery_ into a wide **expanse** of water in the
northern part of Canada. Today, it is named after him: the Hudson Bay.


On the map, the Hudson Bay looks like a big, open body of water. But in
many places, the water gets too shallow for sailing. In many other places, it is
frozen **solid** almost all year long. Once again, Henry Hudson had sailed into
icy waters, just as winter was coming.


Hudson and his crew went ashore during the winter. They ran short of
food and water. Some of the crew got sick. Some died. The sailors blamed
Hudson for caring more about finding the Northwest Passage than about
keeping his crew safe and healthy.

When the ice began to melt, the crew **rebelled** . They forced Hudson,
his son, and a few crew members loyal to Hudson to get into a small boat
with no oars. Then, they left them behind and sailed the _Discovery_ back to
England. No one ever heard from Henry Hudson again.

**The Fur Trade and Samuel de Champlain**


Many of the Frenchmen who came to North America in the 1600s
and 1700s were fur **traders** . These **traders** **traded** with the Native people.
They gave them European goods **in exchange** for animal skins and furs.

The **traders** collected many kinds of fur but they were most interested in
beaver **pelts** . Beaver hats were popular in Europe. You could sell beaver hats
in England, France, Germany, and Russia.


Why were beaver hats so popular? For one thing, beaver fur is thick. It
is thick enough to keep your head warm in a cold Russian winter and it is
waterproof. Rain runs off a beaver hat. Your head stays dry.


Some hatmakers used the beaver fur as it was. They made soft, puffy
hats. Others processed the beaver fur to make **felt** . The smooth, waterproof
**felt** was then formed into hats. **Felt** hats did not look like they were made of
beaver fur. But, they were.


In many parts of Europe, there were no beavers left. Hunters had killed
too many of them. The beaver had almost gone extinct. Europeans could
not get beaver **pelts** at home. So, they were willing to pay for beaver **pelts**
imported from North America.


Samuel de Champlain and other Frenchmen took the lead in the fur
**trade** . They set up **trading posts** in North America. There were **trading**
**posts** along the Atlantic Coast. There were **trading posts** in Quebec and
along the St. Lawrence River. There were even **trading posts** farther west,
along the shores of the Great Lakes.


The following is an adaptation of Champlain’s journey down the River of
the Iroquois to the lake that came to bear his name: Lake Champlain.


July, 1609

We continued on our journey until we came to an island.
The island was about three leagues long and had the **finest** pine
trees that I had ever seen. We went hunting here and captured
some wild animals.

The next day, we started out again, floating down the river
as far as the entrance to a large lake. There were many pretty
islands there. They all contained many **fine** forests and **lush**
meadows. There were too many birds to count. Also, we saw all
kinds of wild animals such as deer with their young fawns, bears,
and many animals that move from the mainland over to the
islands and back again. We captured many of these animals as
well. There were many rivers that emptied into the lake as well as
dense forests of **fine** trees. I found chestnut trees on the border of
the lake. I had never seen trees like this before. There were great
numbers of fish in the lake.

I noticed that many of the mountains in the distance to the
north had snow on top of them. I was told that the Iroquois lived
there and that there were many beautiful valleys with fruit and
grain there.


Many different Native groups lived in these lands. The French settlers
made **treaties** with some of them, including the Algonquin [al-GON-kwin]
people and the Huron [HYER-on] people. The French agreed to **trade** with
these people and not fight with them.


**NAME:**
###### **1** co [2] nt [.] in [6] ued

**DATE:**



TAKE-HOME



Native people would bring beaver **pelts** to **trade** . In some cases, they
would bring **pelts** they had gathered themselves. In other cases, they would
bring **pelts** they had **obtained** by **trading** with other Native people.

The French traders would **barter** with Native people. They would give
them things they wanted **in exchange** for the beaver **pelts** .


Many of the things Native people wanted were made of metal. Most
Native people did not make their own metal products. They had to **trade** for
these items. Many Native people **traded** furs for knives and ax blades. Others
**traded** for kettles and fishhooks. Still others **traded** for glass beads from
Europe, which were highly desirable.

The French merchants would gather up lots of beaver **pelts** . Then, they
would ship the **pelts** back to France and sell them. They made a lot of money
doing this, so they did it again and again.


As time went on, the French traders learned what the Native people
liked. They learned that many Native people would **trade** beaver **pelts** for
wool blankets. Some would **trade** for tobacco. Others would **trade** for guns
and gunpowder.


In 2011, the people of Canada put an image of a beaver on the back of
their nickel. They did not put the beaver on their nickel because he is cute.
They put the beaver there because the fur **trade** is an important part of the
history of Canada. For two hundred years, the fur **trade** was a source of
**income** for French and Native people alike.

**Bartolomé de Las Casas: Protector of Native Americans**


Have you ever changed your mind about something? That is what
happened to Bartolomé de Las Casas.


Las Casas lived with the conquistadors for many years. He helped them
conquer the Americas. Then, he decided that this conquest was wrong.
He spent the rest of his life fighting against the conquistadors and trying
to protect Native Americans.


Las Casas was born in Spain in 1484. He was eight when Columbus
made his first voyage. Ten years later, in 1502, he sailed to the Americas.
He became a plantation owner on the island of Hispaniola. He owned enslaved
people. He helped conquer the Native people that lived there.


In 1510, Las Casas became a Catholic priest. He was the first priest
ordained in America. But his newfound religion caused him to rethink his
views on what Spain was doing.


In 1513, he took part in the conquest of Cuba. What he saw shocked him.
He thought that the Spanish conquerors treated the Native people cruelly.
Las Casas found this disturbing.


Las Casas made a big decision. He decided what the Spanish conquerors
were doing was wrong and not consistent with his Christian faith. It was wrong
to kill and enslave people. It was not moral. It was not ethical.

ASSESSMENT



Las Casas felt ashamed of himself. He felt ashamed of the things he
had done. He felt ashamed of the way he had been living. He gave up his
plantation. He freed the people he had enslaved. He tried to convince others
to do the same, but he did not have much luck.


For the rest of his life, Las Casas fought to protect Native Americans.
He went back to Spain. He spoke to the king and other important men.
He told them what was happening in the colonies. He told them about the
cruelty of the conquistadors. He tried to change the way people thought
about Native Americans.


At the time, many Spaniards felt that it was okay to use force against
non-Christians. They believed that it was okay to conquer the Natives and
force them to accept Christianity.


Some people went even further. They argued that conquest, or
conquering by force, was the only approach that made sense to save the souls
of Native Americans.


Las Casas argued against this way of thinking. He insisted that
Native Americans were capable of thinking for themselves. They deserved
to be treated as free men. They should not be conquered and enslaved.
They should be converted to the true faith. But, they should be converted
by peaceful means.


Las Casas fought to change the laws. He worked to set up colonies where
Native Americans would be treated fairly.


Las Casas also wrote books. His most famous book was _A Brief Account_
_of the Destruction of the Indies_ . This book is an attack on the conquistadors.
Las Casas blamed these men for their cruel treatment of the Natives. “These
men did not behave like human beings,” Las Casas said. “They behaved like
lions and tigers. What made them behave this way? It was greed. They were
driven by greed for gold.”


As you might have guessed, Las Casas was not popular in the Spanish
colonies. Many Spanish settlers hated him. They felt that he was trying to
take away land, power, and the enslaved people they had acquired fairly.
They saw Las Casas as a traitor. They saw him as a man who sided with the
enemy against his own country.


Las Casas was not afraid to be hated. He was a man of great courage.
He was sure he was right. He kept fighting for fifty years, until his death
in 1566.

**The Duke and His Guest**


Many years ago, in a land far, far away, there lived a wise king. One day,
while he was out riding, the king passed a beautiful house.


“Who lives in that house?” he asked his servant.


“Your Majesty,” the servant replied, “the Duke of Luxford lives there.
He is one of the richest men in the land. He puts on the most wonderful
feasts for his wealthy friends!”


“Does he help the people who ask him, like the poor?” asked the King.


“He has not.” answered the servant.


The next day, the king dressed himself in old, ragged clothes and went
to the duke’s house.


The duke came to the front door.


“O Great One,” said the king, bowing low, “won’t you give me a little
food and let me rest in your beautiful home? I am hungry and tired.”


“Be gone!” shouted the duke. “Get off my property at once or I will
have my servants beat you away. I will not have beggars hanging around
my house!”


The king went away.


The next day, the king put the old, ragged clothes on again. Then, he
covered his ragged clothing with a handsome, silken cloak trimmed with
gold and jewels.


He went once more to the duke’s home.

As before, the duke came to the door. When he saw the stranger in the
rich cloak, he spoke to him and invited him in.


“Come in, my friend,” the duke called out. “Come in and join us! It is a
great pleasure to entertain a man like you in my home!”


The king took some of the rich food and broke it into small pieces. But,
instead of eating the food, he put it into the folds of his rich cloak.


“Why do you not eat the food?” asked the duke. “Why do you put it in
your cloak?”


“Because it is my cloak you are feeding and not me,” answered the king.
“Yesterday I came to you dressed like a poor man and you drove me away.
Today, because I have this fine cloak, you have invited me to dine with you.
But, I am the same today as I was yesterday—still your king.”


Then, the duke knelt down.


“Oh, forgive me, Your Majesty!” he cried. “I have been proud and selfish.
I will mend my ways. From this day on, no poor man shall be driven from
my door. You have taught me that a man is more than his clothes.”

**Christopher Columbus and John Cabot:**
**Parallel Lives**



Christopher Columbus was an important explorer. So was John Cabot.
The two men lived at the same time. They were almost the same age.
They were rivals, too. Their lives were connected in interesting ways.


Columbus was probably born in 1451. John Cabot may have been born
the same year.


Columbus was Italian. He was born in Genoa. Cabot was also Italian.
We are not sure where he was born. He may have been born in Genoa.


In the 1470s, Columbus worked as a sailor. He sailed to many ports in the
Mediterranean. During those years, Cabot worked as a merchant. He lived in
Venice, but he traded all around the Mediterranean.


Columbus spent many hours studying maps. In 1485, he came up with a
bold plan. He believed he could reach the Indies by sailing west.


Columbus set out to find a king who would pay for a voyage. He went
to see John II, King of Portugal. John said no. Columbus kept trying.
He presented his plan to other kings, including Henry VII of England.
Finally, he found a sponsor. King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain
agreed to pay for a voyage.


Columbus set sail in 1492. He did not make it to the Indies. He ran
into North America. But Columbus did not realize this. He believed he had
reached the Indies.

In 1494, Cabot learned about Columbus and his journeys. Cabot had
studied maps, too. He thought Columbus had made a mistake. He had sailed
west in the middle latitudes, near the equator. But that is where the distance
around Earth is greatest. Why sail there? Why take the long way? Why not
sail farther north? The distance around the Earth would be much shorter
there. It would be a better way of sailing to the Indies.


Cabot had an idea. He thought he could beat Columbus at his own game.
He drew up a plan. Then, he went looking for a sponsor, just as Columbus
had done.


Cabot looked for funding in Portugal. He was turned down. He went to
Henry VII of England. Henry had turned down Columbus, but he liked the
sound of Cabot’s plan. He agreed to sponsor a voyage.


For the next few years, both men were busy exploring.


Columbus made three more voyages for Spain. He explored the Caribbean
Sea and the coast of South America.


Cabot made three voyages for England. He explored the coast of
North America.


There were many similarities between these two men. But there was one
big difference. Columbus ended up famous. Cabot did not. In fact, for many
years, Cabot was almost forgotten. Even today, historians are still digging
up facts about Cabot. The world has never forgotten about Christopher
Columbus, but it had to be reminded about John Cabot.
