**Family Letter**

**Dear Family Members,**

Please help your student succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your student to
do include: spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, and
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

This week, we are reviewing the spelling patterns of /ə/, /ə/ + /l/, /sh/ + /ə/
+ /n/, /ue/, /oo/, and /f/ that we have already studied. Your student will be
assessed on these words.

Students have been assigned two Challenge Words, _beautiful_ and _definite_ .
Challenge Words are words used very often. The Challenge Words follow the
spelling pattern for /f/ this week.

The Content Word for this week is _Powhatan_ . _Powhatan_ follows one of the
spelling patterns for this week. The first ‘a’ in _Powhatan_ has the sound of /ə/.
This word is directly related to the material that your student is reading in
_Living in Colonial America_ . The Content Word is an optional spelling word
for your student. If your student would like to try it but gets it incorrect, it
will not count against them on the assessment. We encourage everyone to
stretch themselves a bit and try to spell this word.

The spelling words, including the Challenge Words and the Content Word,
are listed on the back of this worksheet.

**The Lost Colony**


**John White at the birth of Virginia Dare**


In April 1587, the English made a second attempt to settle on Roanoke
Island. This time, a man named John White led more than one hundred
men, women, and children—including his own daughter, Eleanor Dare, and
her husband—to establish a **colony** in this territory.


Once again, the settlers faced the same challenges, and their supplies
ran low. However, this time, only John White and a small crew sailed back
to England for supplies, while the others remained in the colony. Just nine
days before he returned to England, his daughter had a baby and named
her Virginia Dare. White’s granddaughter was the first English baby born in
this territory.

**John White and the abandoned Roanoke settlement**


When White and his crew arrived back in England, he learned that the
country was at war with Spain, and he would not be allowed to return to

Roanoke Island. It was not until 1590 that he was able to take a ship and
return to the colony. When White finally arrived back on Roanoke Island,
what do you think he found? Sadly, he found nothing. Well, the island was
still there, along with some abandoned dwellings, but the colonists were
nowhere to be found. White’s only clue to where the colonists might have
gone was the word _CROATOAN_ carved into one tree trunk and the letters
_CRO_ carved into another. _Croatoan_ was believed to be the name of an island
about fifty miles south of Roanoke Island. John White thought the carving
may have been a message that the settlers relocated to that island.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 9** **9**


John White tried to go to Croatoan Island to find the colony, but a huge
storm damaged his ship and forced the crew to return to England. White was
never able to return to the colony again. The mystery of what happened to
these English settlers remains unsolved today. Roanoke Island has become
known as the Lost Colony.

**“The First English Colony”**


Robert and George ran along the long stretch of sandy beach on Roanoke
Island. From time to time, they splashed in the warm waters and collected
shells. It was late August in the year 1587, and, if all went well, they and
the other travelers would be the first **successful** English colonists in North
America. They and others had watched as their leader, John White, sailed
away. He was returning to England to get the supplies they needed to survive
on this island. However, the reason why the boys were playing on this beach
began many years earlier.


In the 1500s, Spain conquered large areas of Central and South America.
Spanish colonists built towns and cities there, claiming the land as their
own. Spanish **galleons** sailed across the Atlantic Ocean laden with gold and
other natural resources taken from these regions. Spain was becoming very
rich. The Queen of England, Elizabeth I, and her favorite knight, Sir Walter
Raleigh, wanted England to become as rich and powerful as Spain. They
wanted English people to go to this place they called the "New World" too.

In 1584, Sir Walter **persuaded** Queen Elizabeth to let him try to create an
English colony in the Americas. It was decided that the English would stay
away from the powerful Spanish conquistadors. Instead of sailing to Central
or South America, they would sail north, to North America. With that
decided, a group of explorers set off to find a suitable place to settle.


The explorers who went on this expedition in 1584 reported back to Sir
Walter and told him about Roanoke Island. Speaking highly of the land they
encountered, they believed this island was a perfect place for the first English


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 9** **19**


colony. Sir Walter’s explorers managed to build a fort on the island to protect
themselves from possible attacks from outsiders, but they failed to create a
colony. They abandoned their mission, leaving only fifteen men behind to guard
the fort. However, Sir Walter was determined to **succeed** . In 1587, more ships set
out for this territory.

Robert and George were members of this second group of **would-be**
English colonists. They had been very excited to set off on this great adventure.
This time, the colonists planned to land north of Roanoke Island, in the
Chesapeake Bay area. There, they hoped to establish the first **successful**
English colony.


Unfortunately, during the trip, there was a disagreement between their
leader John White and members of the ship’s crew. As a result, members of
the ship’s crew refused to take the English travelers to the Chesapeake Bay
area. So, Robert, George, and the other passengers were forced to land on
Roanoke Island in late July. Robert and George had not minded this change
of plan. They had simply been happy to be on solid ground once more.


However, this was not the end of the travelers’ troubles. After landing,
John White led a group of men to Fort Raleigh, the fort that had been built
by the previous group. Robert and George had not been allowed to go with
the men. At the fort, John White and the other men expected to find the
fifteen English soldiers who had been left behind to guard it. When they
arrived at the fort, the soldiers were nowhere to be found. The fort was
**overgrown** with weeds.

When John White and the men returned to the beach with this news,
Robert and George had felt scared. The boys wondered what had happened
to the soldiers. The only good news was that it was possible to repair the
homes in Fort Raleigh.


The settlers got to work. Robert, George, and more than one hundred
men, women, and children worked from sunrise to sunset to reconstruct these
homes. However, the boys and the other settlers found it **alarming** that, when
winter came, they did not have enough food to survive until spring. They had
arrived at a time when it was too late to plant crops.


Robert, George, and the others did not want to return to England
starving and exhausted. They needed a plan. One month after they arrived, it
was decided that John White would take one of the two remaining ships and
return to England to get supplies. If all went well, he would be back before
the **harshest** days of winter arrived.


So Robert and George had watched and played as John White’s ship
sailed out of sight. The two boys remained on the sandy shore and enjoyed
the freedom offered by the land that was new to them. Neither of the boys
missed the busy, crowded streets of Portsmouth, England. They did not miss
the rain or the sight of the poor people who **begged** on the streets. This was
to be their new home and they were thankful to be there. The question was,
would they survive?

Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 9** **25**


The settlers had not chosen the site of their
settlement wisely. Besides the fact that this
land was already occupied by thousands of
Powhatan people, the land they chose for
their settlement provided other challenges.
So close to the water, the land turned
out to be marshy and full of mosquitoes.
When they dug down into the earth to
find drinking water, they found the water
was virtually undrinkable because it was
brackish, or salty. To add to the problems,
some of the settlers wanted to focus on
searching for gold and silver instead of
planting seeds for much-needed crops.
Away from the safety and familiarity of
England, the group began to disagree. It was
clear that the settlers of Jamestown needed a
leader.

**Dear Family Members,**

Please help your student succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your student to
do include: spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, and
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

This week, we are reviewing the spelling patterns of ‘oi’ and ‘oy’ that sound
like /oi/. Your student studied this in Grade 2 so this should be a review. Your
student will be assessed on these words.

Students have been assigned three Challenge Words: _especially_, _whole_, and
_hole_ . Challenge Words are used very often. The Challenge Words do not
follow the spelling patterns for this week and need to be memorized.

The Content Word for this week is _Savannah_ . This word is directly related
to the material that we are reading in _Living in Colonial America_ . The
Content Word is an optional spelling word for your student. If your student
would like to try it but gets it incorrect, it will not count against them on the
assessment. We encourage everyone to stretch themselves a bit and try to
spell this word.

This week in _Living in Colonial America_, your student will be learning
about more English leaders and settlements, colonists working together with
Native Americans, and the Puritans' arrival at Plymouth, Massachusetts. Be
sure to ask your student each evening about what they are learning.

Students will take home text copies of the chapters in the Reader
throughout the unit. Encouraging students to read a text directly related
to this unit-based unit will provide content and vocabulary reinforcement.
Please remind your student that the glossary can be used for finding the
meaning of the bolded words.

**Maryland General Assembly Passing Act of Toleration**


It wasn’t long before word got out that Maryland was quite a nice place
to live in. Europeans searching for a better life free of poverty and religious
persecution journeyed to this colony. And it wasn’t just Roman Catholics
who came. Other Christians who belonged to different churches came to
settle in Maryland, too. Before long, Maryland became known as a place that
practiced religious freedom—so much so that, in 1649, Lord Baltimore had the
Maryland General Assembly pass the Act of Toleration. This law stated that all
Christians in Maryland would be tolerated, or allowed the freedom to worship.
This law confirmed that Christians from different churches—Protestants,
Catholics, and others—could practice their religion without interference.

The journey to Virginia did not start out well. Very strong winds made the
voyage a difficult one. The winds were so strong that they battered the ship
and blew it off course. It took more than two months to complete the journey.
When they finally arrived, they were not in Virginia.


At the first sight of land, the captain instructed that they drop anchor.
Although those on board were happy to see land after two months on board a
ship, it soon became clear that they were not where they were supposed to be.
For one thing, the weather was much colder than they were prepared for.

**The Pilgrims, Part I: Arrival**


Mary and Remember Allerton ran as fast as they could towards their
house. Their stepmother, Fear Allerton, was waiting for them. As their father
had pointed out many times, it was not a good idea to keep a woman whose
name was Fear waiting.


In the late afternoon, the children had gone out to collect firewood. After
gathering the wood, they had stopped to play in the forest with their friends,
Love and Wrestling Brewster. Love and Wrestling Brewster were Pilgrim
brothers. They had also gone into the forest to collect firewood. Like many of
the **Pilgrim** children, these children had been given special names at birth.
Their names often **indicated** what kind of person their parents hoped they
would become. Sometimes their names **revealed** something that had happened
at the time of their birth.


Remember had been given her name because her mother had said that she
would always remember, and never forget, her birth. Wrestling wasn’t happy
with his name. He didn’t feel much like a wrestler. Wrestling planned to change

his name when he was older. He was going to change it to John. He had been a
weak baby and his father had given him the name hoping that it would make
him strong.


When the children had gathered as much firewood as they could carry,
they dropped it into a large pile and played a game of hide and seek. Then, they
climbed trees and collected sweet berries to eat. They pretended to be English
pirates capturing Spanish galleons laden with gold. It wasn’t until the sun
had begun to set that they realized they had been gone for quite some time.
The children **anxiously** gathered up their firewood and made their way home.

Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 9** **83**


Four years earlier, all four of these children had survived the journey
onboard the _Mayflower_ from England. They had arrived in Plymouth,
Massachusetts, in 1621. Their parents were English Separatists. English
Separatists were people who were unhappy with the Church of England and
wanted to start their own church. They wanted to be free to worship God in
their own way.


The king of England, James I, was the head of the Church of England.
He harassed anyone who did not obey the rules of the church. As a result,
many English Separatists left England. The children’s families had first tried
living in the Netherlands, but they were not happy there. Finally, they and
others set out across the Atlantic Ocean to establish their own colony in
North America. Because they were willing to travel to a faraway place for
their religious beliefs, they began calling themselves Pilgrims.

The journey across the ocean, and the first winter in the **colony**, was now
just a terrible memory. So many people had died either on the ship or within
the first months of being in Plymouth. They had died from disease, hunger,
and the extremely cold weather. Mary, Remember, Love, and Wrestling
had **witnessed** many Pilgrims suffer. Worst of all was the death of the girls’

beloved mother. Their father had tried to comfort them as best as he could.
The girls had felt that their hearts had been broken.
Their brother Bartholomew had hidden in the forest for several days.
He had refused to come back no matter how often they called his name.
He finally came back, though. When spring arrived, Bartholomew had
helped their father build a house and plant crops.

The Pilgrims had not **intended** to settle in Plymouth. They had been

and Love had wondered if they would ever see dry land again.


When they finally arrived, it was wintertime and they were in an
unknown land hundreds of miles north of their **intended** destination.
This place was much colder than Virginia. Even more **alarming** was that
many of the Pilgrims had noticed that the soil was not very good for
farming. If they could not farm, they would have no chance of surviving
in this new territory. The children’s new home was not at all what they had
imagined it to be.

**The Pilgrims, Part II: Thanksgiving Celebration**


Do you remember that in the previous chapter, you met the Pilgrim
children Mary and Remember Allerton and Love and Wrestling Brewster? In
the beginning of the story, they were collecting firewood and playing in the
forest. Then, you traveled back in time and learned how they had arrived in
Plymouth, Massachusetts. In this chapter, we will continue to find out more
about their early experiences in Plymouth.


Years earlier, when the Pilgrims and their children arrived in Plymouth
in 1621, they had built shelters by day and returned to their ship by night
to sleep.


In the winter, the Pilgrims shivered in the cold as they buried those that
had not survived. Mary, Remember, Love, and Wrestling had wondered if
they would survive.


While the settlers endured many hardships, the Native Americans in
this region faced them as well. One tribe, the Patuxet, who had lived in the
area, had created fields for planting. Sadly, many members of this tribe had
already died from contagious diseases. Because of this, their fields were not
in use. This meant that the hungry and weary English colonists did not have
to clear the forests before planting. In addition, there was another key factor
to the Pilgrims' survival: the help of the Wampanoag, the Native Americans
living in the area.


Having experienced the loss of his own people, a Native American called
Squanto came to the aid of the Pilgrims. Squanto’s friend Samoset agreed


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 9** **97**


to help, too. Both of these Native Americans spoke English. Squanto spoke
English well. In 1605, he had been taken to England by an English explorer.


Squanto and Samoset showed the Pilgrims how to plant corn, squash,
and beans and how to make these crops grow in the poor soil. Squanto also
taught people to recognize berries and fruits that could be eaten and where
the best places to fish were. Wrestling Brewster often talked of how he had
feared these people at first. But when they helped the settlers, Wrestling
had changed his mind. Love and Wrestling had gone fishing with Squanto.
Squanto gave the Pilgrims hope.

The colonists had also made peace with a local **tribe** called the
Wampanoag. Both sides agreed to help and protect each other. They agreed
to trade with each other, too.


Slowly, the days grew warmer and the Pilgrims became happier.
They were no longer cold and hungry. The first fall was one of the most
precious memories Mary, Remember, Love, and Wrestling had. The crops
had grown well and their harvest was abundant. Besides farming, the
colonists had also learned how to hunt and fish to survive. As a result, they
had produced more than enough food to get them through the next winter.
They had also been able to build homes that would protect them from
the cold weather when it came again. While they mourned the loss of so
many, the surviving colonists were thankful for what they now had. That
is why they decided to give thanks to God for the Native people who had
helped them.


A great celebration of thanksgiving was organized. The local Wampanoag
were invited to the thanksgiving celebration. Squanto and Samoset were


**98** **Unit 9 |** Activity Book Grade 3


**NAME:** TAKE-HOME ACTIVITY PAGE
### **8.5**

continued
**DATE:**


invited, too. The Wampanoag chief, Massasoit (MAS-ə-soyt), was the guest
of honor.


Everyone there had dined on deer, duck, lobster, fish, cornbread,
pumpkin, squash, and berries. They had eaten until they were fuller than
they had ever been before. They had played games and they had run races.
The Wampanoag had stayed in the colony for several days. It was probably
the happiest time the children could ever remember. They often spoke of
it. Since then, more and more Pilgrims had arrived. More homes had been
built. Their father had married Fear Allerton.


All these early experiences of the children happened four years ago. Now,
here the children were, playing in a forest in the colony.


As Mary and Remember hurried out of the forest, they said their
goodbyes to Love and Wrestling. Minutes later they arrived at the door to
their house. Their arrival had not gone unnoticed. The door to their house
was flung open and Fear appeared in the doorway. She stood there with her
hands on her hips.


“It’s a good thing I had already collected firewood earlier in the day or
the fire would have gone out long ago,” she exclaimed. “Anyone would think
you had to grow the tree before cutting it down. Now, go wash your hands
and help me set the table.”


Mary and Remember looked at each other as they inched past their
stepmother. They both knew she was not done scolding them.

**Puritan Life**


Hello, my name is Lizzie. My mother and father are once again displeased
with me. I smiled too much during the morning **sermon**, and then fell
asleep during the afternoon **sermon** . They both said that it is a great sin for a
Puritan child to fall asleep while listening to the word of God.

During the morning **sermon**, I had smiled at the sight of **Elder** Jones’s
new wig. I could not understand why a **minister** of the church would care to
wear such a thing on his head. But seemingly he does. Not only is it a strange
looking sight, it does not appear to sit straight on his head.

As you may or may not know, the most important place for any **Puritan**
is the meeting house. Every **Puritan** meeting house is placed in the center of
a town or village. That is because the meeting house is the center of our lives.
Our church services take place there and so do all important meetings.

We **Puritans** live in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Our colony was
created in partnership with a **Puritan** company called the Massachusetts
Bay Company. The Massachusetts Bay Company sells the fur we get from

hunting and the fish we catch. Our colony is becoming wealthy because of
this trading agreement.


We came here from England in the year 1630. I was just a baby. Now, I
am almost eleven years old. Unlike the Pilgrims, we did not want to break
away from the Church of England. We wanted the church to be **purer** and
stronger. However, neither King James I nor his son King Charles I would
listen to our **requests** for change. In the end, we had no choice but to leave
our homes and start a new life somewhere else.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 9** **111**


We chose to create our own Puritan **colony** on land north of the Pilgrim
**colony** of Plymouth. Guided by our leader, John Winthrop, we sent men
ahead to prepare the way for us. They began the construction of houses
in an area we call Salem. They cleared the land for planting. We now have
four settlements within our **colony** . Apart from Salem, we have Boston,
Charlestown, and Cambridge. The population within our **colony** is growing
rapidly. Each year, hundreds of people come to live their lives with us. I
have heard the grownups say that even King Charles I cannot believe how
successful and strong we are becoming.

Trade ships frequently move in and out of our **harbors** . I love to watch
the men unload items that have been sent across the ocean. We need guns,
tools, and cloth. We hear news from home by talking to the sailors and newly
arrived colonists. It makes our hearts **flutter** when the sailors and passengers
talk of life in England. Just two months ago, I sat on the snow-covered **dock**
and listened to stories from home. The sailors spoke of the **glorious** sound of
the London church bells ringing out on Christmas Day. They also reminded
us of the smell of roasting **pheasant** and sweet plum pudding. As you can
tell, some of us are sometimes **homesick** but we know our cause is **just** and
good and worth the **sacrifice** .


People are welcome here, but all who come to live with us must live
according to the rules of the **Bible** . That is the **Puritan** way. Thus, I must surely
**mend my ways** . I must not smile during **Elder** Jones’s **sermon**, no matter how
long it is. I can tell you, **Elder** Jones does like to do a lot of **preaching** .


My brother George keeps pulling my hair and running away. I have asked
him nicely to stop. I have frowned at him like Mother frowns at me. But still
he continues to do it. I must also make sure that I don’t wag my finger at him.

I must not scold him either. I have done it twice now, though my mother has
not seen me do it. George is the baby in our family. He is no longer a real
baby as he is four years old. My mother and father had seven children, but
we are the only two children still alive. Mother and Father make excuses for
George’s behavior, but not for mine. I must be “responsible Lizzie.”

Well, it seems that **Elder** Jones is not done **preaching** . He has called us
back to the meeting house for one more **sermon** before sunset. I hope he is
not wearing that wig again.

**Dear Family Members,**

Please help your student succeed in spelling by taking a few minutes each
evening to review the words together. Helpful activities for your student to
do include: spelling the words orally, writing sentences using the words, or
simply copying the words.

**Spelling Words**

This week, we are reviewing the spelling patterns /ou/ spelled ‘ou’ and
‘ow’ that your student learned in Grade 2. Your student will be assessed on
these words.

Students have been assigned two Challenge Words, _believe_ and _favorite_ .
Challenge Words are used very often. The Challenge Words do not follow
the spelling patterns for this week and need to be memorized.

The Content Word for this week is _Pennsylvania_ . This word is directly
related to the material that we are reading in _Living in Colonial America_ . The
Content Word is an optional spelling word for your student. If your student
would like to try it but gets it incorrect, it will not count against them on the
assessment. We encourage everyone to stretch themselves a bit and try to
spell this word.

This week in _Living in Colonial America_, your student will read about the
Quakers in Pennsylvania. Students will also read a chapter about a boy who
serves as a printer’s apprentice. Be sure to ask your student each evening
about what they are learning.

Students will take home text copies of the chapters in the Reader
throughout the unit. Encouraging students to read a text directly related to

**DATE:**


**The Quakers and the Lenni Lenape**


Charles, Hester, and their father, Micah, walked slowly toward the **Lenni**
**Lenape** (Le-NAH-pae) village. They were delivering gifts from some of the
families who lived in their small Quaker colony. Just one year earlier, in 1685,
some of the young **Lenni Lenape** men had helped several newly-arrived
English and **Welsh Quakers** clear land for farming.

The gifts they carried were in three straw baskets. The baskets were
heavy and Charles and Hester struggled to carry theirs. The baskets held
**dumplings**, cheese, bread, apple butter, and ham.

Neither Charles nor Hester were nervous about visiting the village.
They had been there several times before with their father. They had even
been inside some of the homes, called wigwams. In fact, both children had
been **astonished** by how warm and dry these homes made of bark were.

The village was on the bank of a long, winding river. In the village, there were
about thirty wigwams and four longhouses. Like the wigwams, the longhouses
were made from a wooden frame covered in bark. Unlike the wigwams, though,
several families lived together in one longhouse. On the **outskirts** of the village,
the children could see the **Lenni Lenape** fields full of corn, squash, and beans.
In the river near the bank, four dugout canoes were bobbing up and down in the
water. Two of the canoes held piles of raccoon, beaver, and fox fur. This fur was a
sign that some of the **Lenni Lenape** men would soon be setting off to trade with
either Europeans or other Native Americans.

Charles and Hester were **Quakers** from a part of England called the
Midlands. They had arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the previous year
with their parents. Philadelphia was a growing town in the English colony
known as Pennsylvania. In 1681, William Penn, a **Quaker** and the leader of


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 9** **137**


this colony, had received the land now known as Pennsylvania from King
Charles II of England. The king had given him the land to settle a debt he
owed to William’s father. William Penn was grateful to the king because
he wanted this land to be a place where **Quakers** could live without fear.
**Quakers** were **persecuted** in England. They were often arrested and some
were killed because of their beliefs.

**Quakers** were unpopular because they did not believe in war, and
therefore, refused to fight. Also, they did not think that there was only one
way to worship God. They often **worshipped** in a place called a meeting
house. They also believed that everyone in the world was equal, which meant
that Native Americans and Africans who were enslaved were equal, too.
These views made members of the king’s government very angry. The king
himself was not pleased with them. William Penn decided that it was time to
find a safe place for **Quakers** to live.

Before leaving England in 1681, William Penn drew up a plan for the
city of Philadelphia. He wanted it to have wide, tree-lined streets and public
parks. He wanted Philadelphia to be a magnificent city within the colony of
Pennsylvania. He wanted it to be a place where people lived in such a way
that they were an example to the rest of the world. People of all faiths, not
only **Quakers**, would be welcome.

As the children neared the village, a **Lenni Lenape** boy ran toward them.
He had clearly been waiting for them.

“Hello, Lapowinsa,” said Charles to the boy.

“Hey,” replied Lapowinsa. “What do you have in the baskets?”

Both Charles and Hester had taught Lapowinsa to speak English. He was
their friend and they enjoyed spending time with him.

**DATE:**


“We have gifts,” Hester replied. Lapowinsa joined the children as they
marched behind their father into the **Lenni Lenape** village.

The people in the village smiled at the children’s father. They came to
greet him. Charles always **admired** the **breechcloths** and leggings, worn in
cold weather, that the men wore. The women wore dresses and their long,
dark hair was braided. The men, women, and children wore **moccasins** on
their feet.

The children’s father had learned to speak a little of the **Lenni Lenape**
language. With William Penn, he had been involved in the purchase of the
land they lived on from the **Lenni Lenape** .

After handing over the gifts, their father was invited to spend time
with some of the **Lenni Lenape** men. This meant that Charles, Hester, and
Lapowinsa would get a chance to play. The children began to walk toward
the river. Lapowinsa had promised to take them out in a canoe to search for
turtles.

“Be back before sunset,” their father called. The children nodded and
then with Lapowinsa leading the way, they ran like the wind across the
open land.

“Primrose, come see the kittens that have just been born,” yelled Patience,
Primrose’s sister.


“See, there are six of them,” Patience continued as her sister appeared at
her side. Primrose sat down next to Patience as she pointed to a spot beneath
a large shrub, where the mother cat and her kittens lay.


The two girls stared long and hard at the tiny creatures that looked more
like little rats than kittens. There were six kittens in all. Their eyes were closed
and they could not walk. They lay in a **heap** together beside their mother.


“I want to keep one as my own,” said Patience.


“Well, you can’t yet,” Primrose replied. “They have to stay with their
mother for at least ten or eleven weeks. Then, you’ll have to ask Mama
and Papa. They’ll say no, though. They don’t like us keeping animals inside
the house.”


“I’ll hide it in a safe place,” said Patience firmly.


“Where?” asked Primrose quite seriously. “Where will you hide it? I can’t
think of one place that Mama and Papa wouldn’t find it.”


“In a bucket,” announced Patience confidently.


“Do you think that a kitten will stay in a bucket all day, waiting for you to
finish your chores?” laughed Primrose. “Do you think Mama and Papa won’t
notice you carrying a bucket around everywhere?”


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 9** **149**


Patience thought about this for a while before she replied. Then she said,
“The kitten will stay in the bucket if I train her to.” Patience chose to ignore
the second part of Primrose’s question.


The two girls continued to debate about whether or not it was possible
to hide a kitten in their small log house without anyone noticing. Like many
colonial **cabins**, theirs consisted of two small rooms downstairs and three
very small bedrooms upstairs. Primrose and Patience shared a bedroom,
as did their three brothers.


Primrose and Patience lived on a farm in southern New Jersey. They and
the rest of their family were **originally** from Sweden. They had moved to this
English **colony** because of their Uncle Sven. He had written to their father
and told him about the wonderful life they could have there.


Uncle Sven had traveled to New Jersey from Sweden in 1699. That was
exactly thirty years after the English had taken control of this region from
the Dutch. Uncle Sven was now a successful wheat farmer.


The girls and their family had arrived in New Jersey in 1701. Primrose
and Patience lived with their father, mother, and three brothers on a one

hundred **acre** farm. On their farm, they grew wheat, **rye**, and **barley** . They
kept cows, pigs, and chickens, too. Most people in the Middle Atlantic
colonies lived on small farms that ranged from fifty **acres** to one hundred
fifty **acres** . These farms were quite spread apart and neighbors didn’t see
much of each other except at church on Sunday. Sometimes they got together
for special **occasions** or if someone needed help.

The farm that the girls lived on had a house and a large barn. They had
a garden where they grew vegetables, berries, and fruits. They had a small
**orchard**, too. Their garden was fenced, as was the area where they kept their
pigs. Their cows were sent out to **graze** in the pasture each morning and
brought back into the barn each night for milking. Their farm animals were
valuable, and they kept a close eye on them.


After a while, the girls’ older brother Lars found them by the shrub. Lars
had been sent to look for them by their father. He sat down beside the girls
and peeked at the kittens. Finally, he spoke.


“You two are needed in the barn. Papa wants you to lead the cows out into
the pasture. Then, Mama wants you to weed and water the garden. After that,
she wants you to go inside and help her with the new quilt she is making.”


Primrose and Patience sighed. They knew they had several hours
of chores ahead of them. Next week would be even busier. It was spring
cleaning week. They would have to help Mama make soap before they
cleaned and swept out the whole house.


Before scampering off, Patience knelt down and kissed the small pile of
newborn kittens. “I’ll be back later,” she whispered.

**The Common Course and Condition**


The Pilgrims landed at Plymouth in 1620. In England, they had
suffered for their religious beliefs. In America, they hoped to make
a better life. They were eager to create the sort of community that
seemed best to them.


Before they sailed, the Pilgrims had agreed to a plan. They called
this plan the “Common Course and Condition.” The Pilgrims agreed
to work together and share the food they grew. They agreed that
whatever they harvested would be shared equally. Everybody would
get an equal share. It would not be your corn and my corn, his corn
and her corn. It would be our corn.


The Pilgrims believed this would be a good way to run their
new colony. They believed the “Common Course and Condition”
was consistent with their Christian religious ideas.


They thought it would encourage teamwork and brotherhood.
They were confident it would get everyone working together.


The Pilgrims followed the “Common Course and Condition”
for their first two years in North America. In the spring of 1621,
they planted crops. In the fall, they harvested the crops and
divided up the harvest. Each Pilgrim got an equal share of the
corn. In 1622, they did the same thing.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 9** **163**


By 1622, many Pilgrims had grown unhappy with the
Common Course. The governor, William Bradford, was one of
them. He felt that the Common Course was not working.


Some people worked hard every day. When harvest time
came, these hard workers got one basket of corn. Other people
worked hard some days. These people also got one basket of corn.
Some people did very little work. These people got one basket
of corn.


The hard workers were upset. They were working harder.
Shouldn’t they get more corn? Why should they have to sweat all
day in the fields to raise food for slackers who did much less?


Bradford and the other Pilgrims discussed the situation. In the
end, they decided that the Common Course had to go. They made
a new law. Each Pilgrim family was given a piece of land. On this
land, the family members were allowed to grow corn for themselves.
They did not have to share the corn with the rest of the community.
They could keep what they grew.


What do you think happened?


The new plan was a big success. Bradford wrote that it “made
all hands very industrious.” In other words, everybody started
working hard. Much more corn was planted and much more was
harvested. Pilgrims who had complained about life under the
Common Course now “went willingly into the field.”

**The Cobbler’s Song**


Once there was a poor cobbler who lived in the basement of
a large house in Paris. The cobbler had to work hard all day to
make enough money to support his family. But he was happy and
he sang all day as he mended shoes.


On the floor above him lived a rich man. His rooms were
large and sunny. He wore fine clothes and had plenty of good
things to eat. Even so, he was never happy. All night long he lay
awake thinking about his money—how could he protect the
money he already had? How could he get more? Often, the sun
rose before he fell asleep.


The poor cobbler always got up before sunrise and went to
work. As he hammered, he sang. His song floated up to the rich
man’s apartment and woke him.


“Drat!” cried the rich man. “I can’t sleep at night for thinking
of my money and I can’t sleep in the daytime because of that silly

cobbler and his singing. I must find a way to stop him.”


The rich man sat down and thought the matter over.


“If the cobbler had something to worry about,” he said to
himself, “then he would not sing all day. What worries men most?
Why, money to be sure! Some men worry because they have so
little. The cobbler has little enough, to be sure. Still, that does not
seem to worry him. He is the happiest man I know.”


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 9** **167**


“Other men worry because they have too much money. That
is my trouble. I wonder if the cobbler would worry more if he had
more money. Hmm. It’s not a bad idea.


“Anyway, it can’t hurt to try!”


A few minutes later, the rich man entered the cobbler’s home.
“What can I do for you?” asked the cobbler.


“Here,” said the rich man. “I have brought you a present.”
He gave the poor man a purse.


The cobbler opened it and saw it was full of gold pieces. “I can’t
take this!” said the cobbler. “I have not earned it.”


“You have earned it,” said the rich man. “You have earned it
by your singing. I give it to you because you are the happiest man
I know.”


Then, the rich man left.


The cobbler turned the gold pieces out on his table and began
to count them. He had counted to fifty-two when he looked up
and saw a man passing by the window. He quickly hid the gold
under his apron and went into the bedroom to count it where no
one could see him.


He piled the coins up on the bed. How golden they were! How
bright! He had never seen so much money before. He looked
at the money until everything in the room seemed golden and
bright. Then, he counted it.

**DATE:**


“One hundred pieces of gold! How rich I am! But where shall
I hide it?”


First, he hid it under the covers of the bed. Then, he sat down
and looked at the bed. “The coins make a lump under the covers,”
he said. “Someone else might see them and steal them. I think I
will hide the purse under the pillow instead.”


While he was putting it under the pillow, his wife came into
the room. “What is the matter with the bed?” she asked.


The angry cobbler glared at her and drove her from the room
with angry words—the first cross words he had ever spoken to her.


Dinner time came, but the cobbler could not eat a mouthful.
He was afraid somebody would steal his treasure while he was at
the table. By supper time he felt even worse.


Not a note did he sing all day long. Not a kind word did he
speak to his wife. He went to bed half sick with worry and fear.
All night long, he tossed and turned. He did not dare go to sleep,
lest he should wake to find his gold gone.


Days passed and the cobbler grew more and more unhappy.
He worried about his money all day and all night. He was afraid
of other people. He did not even trust his wife. He no longer sang
at his work and was grouchy most of the time.


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 9** **169**


But upstairs the rich man was happy. “That was a good
plan,” he said to himself. “Now I can sleep all day without being
wakened by the cobbler’s songs.”


For a month, the cobbler worried over his gold. He grew
thin and pale and his wife and children were unhappy. At last, he
could bear the worry no longer, so he called his wife and told her
the whole story.


“Dear husband,” she said, “give the gold back. All the gold in
the world is not worth as much to me as one of your songs.”


How happy the cobbler felt when his wife said this! He picked
up the purse and ran upstairs to the rich man’s room. Throwing the
gold on the table, he cried, “Here is your money. Take it back. I can
live without your money, but I cannot live without my songs.”


7. Why did the rich man give the cobbler the purse full of gold pieces?

A. The rich man said he couldn’t use it because he had too much money
already.

B. The cobbler begged the rich man for it.

C. The cobbler caught the rich man stealing it from someone else.

D. The rich man said the cobbler earned it by being the happiest man he knew.

**An Account of Pennsylvania**


In 1681, Gabriel Thomas left his home in Wales. He sailed to America 13
and settled in Pennsylvania. At the time, Pennsylvania was a new colony. 25
It had been set up by the Quaker William Penn. Thomas went there partly 39
because he was a Quaker, too. 45

Thomas lived in Pennsylvania for 16 years. In 1697, he sailed back to 58
Europe. The next year, he published a book. It was called _An Account of_ 72
_Pennsylvania_ . Here are some of the details Thomas reported in his book. 84

Philadelphia is the main city of Pennsylvania. It sits between two rivers. 96
One is the Schuylkill; the other is the great Delaware. Ships may come to the 111
city by either of these two rivers. 118

The air in Pennsylvania is very pleasant and wholesome. The sky is rarely 131
cloudy. Winters are a little colder than in England and Wales. Summers are a 145
little hotter. The earth is very fertile and good for farming. 156

In Pennsylvania, land is cheap. A man can buy 100 acres of land for ten 171
or fifteen pounds. 174

Corn grows well there. Most years the farmers get twenty to thirty 186
bushels of corn for each bushel they plant. 194

Wages are high. A poor man can make three times as much as he 208
would make in England. A carpenter can make five or six shillings a day. 222
A shoemaker can get two shillings for a pair of shoes. A potter can get 237
sixteen pence for a pot which may be bought in England for four pence. 251


Grade 3 Activity Book **| Unit 9** **175**


Women can earn good wages there as well. There are not many women 264
there. So seamstresses are well paid. 270


Pennsylvania is open to all. The Church of England and the Quakers 282
have equal shares in government. There is no persecution for religion. 293


There are many sorts of wild animals in Pennsylvania. There are 304
panthers, bears, and foxes. There are muskrats, hares, and raccoons. You can 316
hunt in the forests without getting special permission. 324


There are many red deer. I once bought a large one from the Native 338
Americans for two gills of gunpowder. These deer make excellent food. 349


The opossum is a strange creature. She has a pouch to hold her young. 363
She keeps them there, safe from all dangers. 371


They also have flying squirrels. The flying squirrel has flaps of skin that 384
are like wings. It is much lighter than a common squirrel. I have seen them fly 400
from one tree to another. But how long they can stay in the air is not known. 417


There are many birds in Pennsylvania, too. They have swans, ducks, and 429
geese. They also have turkeys, eagles, and pheasants. 437


Reader, what I have written here is not a fiction, flam, or whim. It is all 453
true. I was an eyewitness to it all. For I went to Pennsylvania in the first ship 470
that sailed there, in the year 1681. 477
